It is a little musical theme that is often repeated in a piece of music, very often in opera. The leitmotif is linked in the musical story with a person or a thing or an idea. The leitmotif might be a short tune, but it can also be a rhythm or just a chord.\nThe word \u201cleitmotif\u201d is sometimes used in other things such as literature. In a book it might be an idea that keeps coming during the story. It can also be used in movies or video games.\nThe word \u201cleitmotif\u201d is particularly associated with the operas of Richard Wagner. The leitmotif helps to make the story dramatic and bind it together, because it makes the music easier to understand. Sometimes a leitmotif will change during an opera as the character changes. Various dramatic effects can be made with leitmotifs. For example, a leitmotif might be played before a character comes onstage, so the audience will know who is coming before the actor can be seen. Three examples of leitmotifs from Wagner's Ring Cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen \" are: the leitmotif for the chief god Wotan (a person), the leitmotif for the Tarnhelm, the invisibility helmet, (a thing), and the leitmotif for the Renunciation of Love (an idea).\nThe use of leitmotif was not completely new in the 19th century. For example: the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony are used like a leitmotif during the whole symphony. It was, however, Carl Maria von Weber who first used it a lot in his operas. A music critic called F. W. J\u00e4hns used the word to describe Weber\u2019s work. Hector Berlioz wrote a symphony called \"Symphonie Fantastique\" which has a tune which he called id\u00e9e fixe (\u201cfixed idea\u201d) to represent the love between the two characters.\nWagner did not actually use the word \u201cleitmotif\u201d. He preferred to call such themes \u201cGrundthema\u201d (basic idea) or simple \u201cMotiv\u201d. Some people, such as Eduard Hanslick, who did not like Wagner\u2019s music, thought that Wagner\u2019s use of leitmotifs made the music too simple. Claude Debussy said the use of leitmotifs in operas was like having a world where crazy people would always use \"visiting cards\" to introduce themselves and then start singing their names to be sure everyone knew what was going on.\nMany other composers used leitmotifs in a similar way to Wagner, e.g. Richard Strauss in his operas, Elgar in his oratorios \"The Kingdom\" and \"The Apostles\" or Alban Berg in his opera \"Lulu\". \nLeitmotifs or music themes are also used to dramatise movies. For example, the famous Jaws theme uses a leitmotif for the shark."}

They are made with a wide, flat, reinforced front end. This lets the dancer stand on tiptoe. \nIn normal flat ballet shoes, the toe construction does not provide this support for the dancer's body weight. So they cannot stand or dance \"en pointe\".\nHistory.\nMid-18th century dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet was the first to wear a non-heeled shoe, enabling her to perform leaps that would have been difficult, if not impossible, in the old shoes.\nThe first dancers to rise up on their toes did so with the help of an invention by Charles Didelot in 1795. His 'flying machine' lifted dancers upward, allowing them to stand on their toes before leaving the ground. This lightness and ethereal quality was well received by audiences and, as a result, choreographers began put more pointework into their pieces.\nAs dance progressed into the 1800s, the desire grew to dance en pointe without the aid of wires. When Marie Taglioni first danced \"La Sylphide\" en pointe, her shoes were nothing more than modified satin slippers. Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support.\nThe birth of the modern pointe shoe may be due to the early 20th century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who was one of the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova's feet had particularly high archs, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. To help this problem, she would put tough leather soles into her shoes for extra support, and would flatten and harden the toe area to form a box. While this practice made dancing en pointe easier for her, it was regarded by her rivals as 'cheating'.\nHealth concerns.\nGirls will usually start en pointe between the ages of 10 and 13. Starting too early may be bad for the feet of the dancer. Dance teachers' societies give their members information and advice on this subject.\nSome girls will never go en pointe. This is usually because they are not strong enough, as going en pointe means one has to have enough strength. Ballet class is not social dancing, it is aimed at professional training. But the basic pre-pointe class may still be useful for young dancers who later move into, for example, stage dancing. In that case, the lack of pointe work would not interfere with their eventual employment.\nIt takes considerable strength in the feet, ankle, leg, knee, and abdomen to dance en pointe. Students must be at least 11 or 12 years of age before attempting pointe work. The bones and growth plates in the feet are usually not fully hardened and developed before that age. Serious foot deformities can result from starting pointe too early, even if the student is strong and skillful. Attempting to dance en pointe before the feet and toes are fully grown can cause career-ending damage that will prevent dancing en pointe for a lifetime. Top ballet schools have specialist orthopaedic consultants, and foot X-rays are an obvious and necessary safeguard before pointe work begins.\nUsage by male dancers.\nPointe shoes are normally only worn by female ballet dancers. Male dancers may wear them for a comic effect in unorthodox roles such as the Ugly Stepsisters in \"Cinderella\", or Bottom in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". The all-male dance troupe Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo have dance programs with choreography entirely on pointe. This is one element of spectacle for the audience to demonstrate how the physical demands of classical ballet combine the artistic and the athletic.\nConstruction.\nAll pointe shoes are handmade. There are many different companies which make these shoes. Some of them include: Bloch, Capezio, Gamba, Grishko, Gaynor Mindens, Sansha and Freed of London.\nThere are many different parts to a pointe shoe:\nProper fit and safety.\nIts important that pointe shoes fit correctly. If they do not, it can cause the dancers feet to become sore. It can also affect the way the dancer performs in them and may cause injury to the dancer. A dancer may need to try on many pairs of pointe shoes before they find ones that fit correctly. Also, when the pointe shoes are \"dead\" (too soft to dance in any more), the shoes will need to be replaced.\nWith light use, a pair of pointe shoes may last through ten to twenty hours of wear. A dance student may get weeks of serviceable use from a pair of pointe shoes. Professional dancers wear out pointe shoes much more quickly; a new pair may wear out in a single performance. As a result, ballet companies either buy shoes in bulk or give shoe allowances for their dancers.\nQuantity &amp; quality.\nBallet companies order pointe shoes in huge quantities at maybe $50-$110 a pair. A soloist or principal dancer will have her shoes specially hand-made to her needs, and may get through several in a single performance. Dancers' feet take a terrific battering, and few end their careers without having some damage to their feet. This is the reality behind the light, airy, graceful sight on the stage.\nDemi-pointe.\nDemi-pointe shoes are often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They help dancers get used to the feel of pointe shoes, strengthen the ankles and feet. The toe box allows the dancer to feel a pointe, while the insole and outsole work together to give the resistance for developing foot and ankle strength.\nDemi-pointe is often used in modern dance, because choreography in modern dance most often asks for balance on the ball of the foot, which is what those shoes are made for."}

They are among the most impressive carnivores that ever have lived. These cats had long canines and jaws which opened wider than modern cats. This suggests a different style of killing from modern felines.\nThe sabre-tooth style of life evolved at least five times amongst carnivorous mammals. This is one of the best-known examples of convergent evolution.\nThe saber tooths were ambush predators, and probably lived in open forests. This would explain their widespread occurrence in the Miocene, when much of the land was covered with woodland. Apart from the canine teeth, their adaptations included strength in the forelimbs (more so than present-day large cats). Their robust (heavy, tough) bodies speak of strength rather than speed.\nAn idea of how they killed is as follows. They hid in wait, and pounced. They hung on round the prey's neck, gripping and slashing the underside of the throat with their canine teeth. This would cause death by blood loss and loss of the air supply.\nThe fact that their teeth vary is interesting. Some have larger teeth, some had smaller dagger-like teeth, some had smooth thick teeth, others had blade-like teeth, sometimes with serrated edges. Some had flanges on the lower jaw, most did not. Ewer remarks that this must show that there were variations in killing method, and in the type of prey, but we know little about this.\nThere are none living today: they are extinct. The extinctions followed climate change, as the world cooled and grassland took over from woodland in the Pliocene and Pleistocene."}

It operates mostly through its \"Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers\" chain of bookstores which is based in lower Fifth Avenue in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Barnes &amp; Noble also operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain.\nThe company is known for large, upscale retail stores. Many of them contain a caf\u00e9 serving Starbucks Coffee. Most stores also sell magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, and music. Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets until October 2004. Then, the division was made into its own company.\nAs of October 2009, the company operates 777 stores in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It also has 636 college bookstores, which serves nearly 4 million students and 250,000 faculty members across the country.\nHistory.\nBarnes &amp; Noble began in 1873 when Charles Barnes opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois. Their first true bookstore was set up by his son, William, with G. Clifford Noble, in 1917 in New York City. The original bookstore was at 31 West 15th St., and opened during World War I. In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore was moved to its current location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue.\nThe business was bought in 1971 by Leonard Riggio. He oversaw the growth of the business. In 1974, Barnes &amp; Noble became the first bookstore to advertise on television. A year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books. It sold \"New York Times\" best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers\u2019 list price. During the 1970s and 1980s, Barnes &amp; Noble opened smaller discount stores. These were eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were mostly low price reissues of out-of-print titles. Selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes &amp; Noble to reach new customers nationwide.\nBarnes &amp; Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s. In 1987 it purchased the mostly shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson. The last B. Dalton stores closed in January 2010. The purchase of 797 bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer. As of the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States. B&amp;N's critics claim that it has added to the decline of local and independent booksellers.\nIt first began selling books online in the late 1980s, but the company\u2019s website was not launched until May 1997. The site now carries over 1 million titles.\nIn 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named CEO.\nSteve Riggio, CEO and Vice Chairman.\nSteve Riggio is vice chairman of the company and served on the board of directors. Riggio began his career at Barnes &amp; Noble in 1975 after graduating from Brooklyn College. After getting his start in the buying and merchandising departments, he became general manager and vice president of the company\u2019s direct mail division. He held this position from 1981 to 1987. Riggio became executive vice president of merchandising in 1987. Then, in 1995, he was appointed chief operating officer. He was appointed CEO in January 2003 and held that position till March 2010. In addition to his career at Barnes &amp; Noble, Riggio serves on the board of directors of the National Book Foundation, Association for the Help of Retarded Children and the National Down Syndrome Society. According to Forbes.com, in 2007 Riggio\u2019s salary is $786,358 a year. He also earns $2,323,942 in other long-term payments, for a yearly grand total of $3,110,480.\nPublishing.\nBarnes &amp; Noble publishes some of the books it sells. It reprints non-copyrighted titles or gets the American or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes &amp; Noble pays for reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.\nBarnes &amp; Noble began to publish books during the 1980s, when they started reissuing out-of-print titles. One of these titles, \"The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense\" by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies. The reissued edition of \"The Columbia History of the World\" by John Garrity has sold over 1 million copies.\nSince then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was helped by the company\u2019s purchase of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company. Further expansions of the company\u2019s publishing business include the purchase of how-to publisher Sterling Publishing in 2003 and the launch of Quamut in 2008.\nFrom around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes &amp; Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes &amp; Noble Classics Collection. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dustjacket edition. In 2003, Barnes &amp; Noble redesigned and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, trade paperback and mass-market editions.\nCaf\u00e9s.\nThe first store to feature a caf\u00e9 serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey in 1993. Since then, most stores have been changed or built specifically to feature a cafe. The cafes serve Starbucks beverages, Harney &amp; Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the caf\u00e9s are owned and operated by Barnes &amp; Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.\nIn 2004, Barnes &amp; Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the caf\u00e9 area of selected stores, using the AT&amp;T FreedomLink network. All 777 stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. As of July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.\nCommunity involvement.\nBarnes &amp; Noble hires community relations managers to engage in community outreach. The tasks of these managers include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children\u2019s storytimes and book groups. Community relations managers work closely with local schools and groups for the promotion of literacy and the arts. One of the things that Barnes &amp; Noble does in the community is sponsor a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year. Barnes &amp; Noble also hosts bookfairs which raise funds for schools and libraries. The company also hosts an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. in 2007, 1.16 million books were collected and distributed. To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes &amp; Noble has started a summer challenge where if children read 8 books and write about their reading, Barnes &amp; Noble will give the readers a free book.\nBarnes &amp; Noble Nook.\nBarnes &amp; Noble Nook is an electronic book reader created by the company, based on the Android platform. The device was announced in the United States on 20 October 2009. It was released 30 November 2009 for US$259. nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Sony Reader, and other readers, and includes Wi-Fi and AT&amp;T 3G wireless connectivity, a six-inch E Ink display, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device.\nCollege bookstores.\nBarnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers, Inc. is a part of the company which operates bookstores at more than 600 colleges. College Bookstores was previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio. It is based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey.\nBarnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers says that its store at Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City is the \"world's largest bookstore\". This store carries a large variety of textbooks, medical books, and medical supplies in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores."}

Often it is not known what causes a condition found at birth. In common use, it is often redirected to \"birth defect\". That term is also neutral as to cause. \nThere are two main types of congenital defect. The first is caused by genetic abnormalities, which are hereditary. The second may be caused by conditions (such as infectious diseases) which a baby may get. However, we may not know what caused the condition.\nSometimes doctors may find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth. They use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests, such as amniocentesis.\nGenetic defects.\nLethal or damaging genes.\nSome gene alleles (versions of a gene) can damage the baby.\nConditions like dwarfism are nearly always genetic in origin. One type, achondroplasia, happens when a child's bones does not grow correctly. Another type is caused by pituitary malfunction, where the pituitary gland, which puts out growth hormones, does not work properly.\nMany genetic disorders are caused by mutations (or changes) in gene alleles. Mutations can cause development to go wrong, or a simple biochemical deficiency (the body does not have enough of an important chemical). In the case of a chemical deficiency, the problem may be curable. For example, phenylketonuria was a cause of mental retardation. Doctors came up with a simple test to find which babies have this condition. They found that if these children got treated and followed a strict diet, they could get enough of the chemical they needed. Phenylketonuria now causes few cases of mental retardation.\nChromosome defects.\nCells divide and copy themselves to produce gametes. Sometimes, errors happen in the way that chromosomes are copied during this process. These errors are then copied again and again as cells keep dividing and copying themselves. The most common chromosomal disorder is Down syndrome ('Mongolism'). This condition happens when a child has three copies of the 21st chromosome, instead of two.\nMaternal environment.\nInfectious diseases.\nThe other main type of congenital disorder is caused by an infectious disease being passed from mother to child. For example, If a pregnant woman gets rubella, her child can have many birth defects. Congenital syphilis was common a century ago, and congenital AIDS occurs today, and is common in some parts of Africa.\nScreening and antibiotics has caused the number of infections transmitted by the mother to drop. It is a much smaller proportion than a century ago, despite AIDS. Also, maternal nutritional defects are much rarer, except in countries where food supply is limited. Therefore, \"genetic disorders have grown as a proportion of the total congenital defects\".\nSubstances taken by the mother.\nChemicals.\nSometimes mothers take chemicals which cause the embryo damage. Any substance that causes birth defects is known as a teratogen.\nDrugs taken by the mother may affect development of the embryo. Pregnant women are not allowed to use some drugs. For example, thalidomide should not be used by a pregnant woman, or it can cause many defects in the foetus.\nLifestyle.\nIf the mother took certain things during pregnancy, these can lead to problems with the baby. Common examples of such things are smoking tobacco, or drinking alcohol. Food related: Pregnant women should eat well. If a pregnant woman does not receive enough folic acid with her food, the child can get neural tube defects.\nSensible precautions.\nMany women give up cigarettes and alcohol when pregnant, because this gives the embryo a better chance of developing normally.\nHow common birth defects are.\nAbout 3 percent of all babies have what is called a \"major physical anomaly\". This is something that damages the way the baby looks, or how it functions (its physiology).\nBirth defects involving the brain are the most common problems. They concern about 10 per 1000 live births, compared to heart problems, at 8 per 1000, kidney problems at 4 per 1000, and limbs at 1 per 1000. All other physical anomalies together occur in 6 per 1000 live births.\nBirth defects of the heart have the highest risk of death during childhood. They are the cause of 28% of infant deaths due to birth defects. chromosomal abnormalities and respiratory abnormalities each account for 15%, and brain malformations about 12%. About 10% of deaths in children are because of a genetic disease. This is (in modern times) more than the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases.\nChina Birth Deformity Monitoring Centre says that one baby with birth defects is born every 30\u00a0seconds in China.\nMiscarriages.\nPregnancies which do not come to term (miscarriages) have similar causes to birth defects. Many will be due to failures in the genetics controlling development of the embryo.\nMost clinically apparent miscarriages (two thirds to three-quarters in various studies) occur during the first trimester. Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks.\nA pregnancy with a genetic problem has a 95% probability of ending in miscarriage. Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher miscarriage rates observed in older women."}

The dish often contains other ingredients. Cream, butter, milk, water or oil (used in China) will dilute the egg proteins to create a softer texture.\nSample recipe.\nThe eggs and a large piece of butter are put into a saucepan over a low heat. The egg whites and egg yolks are then \"scrambled\" or mixed together. The mixture should be mixed together all the time they are being cooked.\nWhen cooked a little cr\u00e9me fr\u00e2iche is added. This is because the eggs will be hot enough to carry on cooking themselves. Adding a cool liquid will stop the eggs from overcooking. Some salt and pepper or other seasoning can be added to taste as well.\nIn the home the eggs can be mixed together first and then poured into a pan. The cr\u00e9me fr\u00e2iche does not need to be added if the eggs will be eaten almost immediately.\nProperly made, the eggs should be moist and creamy consistency. If any liquid is coming from the eggs, it means the eggs have been overcooked or that the add the vegetables were undercooked.\nOther methods of preparation.\nUsing a double boiler or \"bain-marie\" means that the heat is constant, and does not to be adjusted to make sure the eggs do not brown or burn. The baine marie method is slower than cooking directly in a pan over a heat but makes it easier to cook the eggs perfectly. The eggs must be taken out of the bain marie when cooked, otherwise they will carry on cooking and spoil.\nScrambled eggs may also be made in a microwave oven by put the ingredients in a glass bowl and cooking for 30 seconds then whisking, then cooking and whisking again until the desired consistency is achieved.\nVariations of Scrambled Egg Dishes.\nMany things can be added to scrambled eggs. Often the end result can have a different name, for example:"}

As well as being Queen of Bohemia, she was also titled Electress of Palatine and Princess Elizabeth Stuart of Scotland Elizabeth was the oldest daughter of King James VI of Scotland (later, James I of England) and his wife, Anne of Denmark. Her brother was Charles I. She was Queen of Bohemia only for a few months so she is sometimes called \"The Winter Queen\".\nChildhood.\nElizabeth was born at Falkland Palace in Fife, Scotland. Her father gave her the name Elizabeth to make Queen Elizabeth I of England happy. The Queen had no children. James wanted her to choose him to be King of England when she died. She later agreed and James VI became King James I of England (as well as Wales and Ireland) in 1603. Elizabeth Stuart now had a higher status. This meant meant that more important men would want to marry her.\nThe gunpowder plot.\nAt this time, there was strong fighting between Catholics and Protestants in England. King James was a devout Protestant, and many Catholics did not like him because he persecuted many papists by levying taxes against them, banning Mass, and even executing people for being heretics and witches if they didn\u2019t denounce Catholicism. In 1605, a group decided to try to blow up the English Parliament with gunpowder when King James was there. This is called The Gunpowder Plot. The group planned to kidnap Princess Elizabeth from Coombe Abbey, in Warwickshire. They wanted to make her the Queen. Because she was only nine years old, important Catholics would have the real power over her kingdoms. In the end, the group were found before they could kill King James.\nMarriage.\nOn February 14 1613, Elizabeth married Frederick V. He was the Elector of the Palatinate. She moved to his court at Heidelberg. Frederick was the leader of an important group of Protestant princes, called the Evangelical Union. James wanted Elizabeth to marry someone from this group so he could have a stronger friendship with them. \nQueen of Bohemia.\nIn 1619, Frederick was asked to become King of Bohemia. He and Elizabeth moved to Prague. There was also strong fighting between different religious groups there. After only a few months of being King, Frederick had to leave the country. Because she was queen for such a short time, Elizabeth is sometimes called \u2018The Winter Queen\u2019. She was also called \u2018Queen of Hearts\u2019 because many people liked her.\nExile and death.\nElizabeth and Frederick lived in exile in The Hague. They could not return to Bohemia. Frederick died in 1632 and Elizabeth lived in Holland for most of the rest of her life. After her brother\u2019s son, Charles, became King of England and Scotland, she went to London to see him. She died there in 1662, when she was 65 years old.\nChildren.\nShe had thirteen children in total. Charles I Louis, became Elector of the Palatine in 1648. Her other children were: Frederick Henry von der Pfalz, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, Louise Marie of the Palatinate, Prince Maurice von Simmern, Edward, Count Palatine of Simmern and Sophia of Hanover. After the 1701 Act of Settlement, Electress Sophia and her children were made heirs to the English and Scottish thrones. This means that all Kings and Queens of Great Britain after George I are Elizabeth\u2019s descendants.\nLegacy.\nThe Elizabeth River in Southeastern Virginia was named in honour of the princess. Cape Elizabeth a peninsula and, today, a town in the U.S. state of Maine was also named for her. John Smith explored and mapped New England. He gave names to places mainly based on the names used by Native Americans. When Smith showed his map to Charles I, he said that the king should feel free to change the \"barbarous names\" for \"English\" ones. The king made many such changes. Only four survive today. One of which is Cape Elizabeth."}

Holloway remains officially missing to this day, although according to Aruban authorities, she is most likely dead. The disappearance generated a media sensation in both the U.S. and Aruba and sparked considerable interest in the Netherlands.\nHolloway was scheduled to fly home later on May 30, but failed to appear for her flight. She was last seen by her classmates outside Carlos'n Charlie's, a Caribbean chain restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad, in a car with locals Joran van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. When questioned, the three men said they dropped her off at her hotel and denied knowing what became of Holloway. Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence the three men were released without charge after each arrest.\nHolloway background.\nNatalee Ann Holloway was born October 21, 1986, in Clinton, Mississippi, the daughter of David Edward Holloway and Elizabeth Ann (\"Beth\") Holloway. Her parents divorced in 1993, and she and her younger brother Matthew were raised by their mother. In 2000, Elizabeth Holloway married George \"Jug\" Twitty, a prominent Alabama businessman, and Natalee moved with her family to Mountain Brook, Alabama. Holloway graduated with honors from Mountain Brook High School. She was also a member of the National Honor Society, her school Dance squad, and was a participant in other extracurricular activities.\nDisappearance.\nOn Thursday, May 26, 2005, Holloway and 124 fellow graduates of Mountain Brook High School, located in a wealthy suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, arrived in Aruba for a five-day, unofficial graduation trip. The graduates were accompanied by seven chaperones. According to teacher and chaperone Bob Plummer, the chaperones met with the students each day to ensure nothing was wrong. However, Jodi Bearman\u2014the chaperone who organized the trip\u2014has stated, \"the chaperones were not supposed to keep up with their every move\".\nPolice Commissioner Gerold Dompig, who would head the investigation from mid-2005 until 2006, described the behavior of the Mountain Brook students, stating there was \"wild partying, a lot of drinking, lots of room switching every night. We know the Holiday Inn told them they were not welcome next year. Natalee, we know, she drank all day every day.\nHolloway was last seen by her classmates leaving the Aruban bar and night club Carlos'n Charlie's around 1:30\u00a0a.m. on Monday, May 30. Holloway left with 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, a Dutch honors student living in Aruba and attending the Aruba International School, and his two Surinamese friends, 21-year-old Deepak Kalpoe and 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe, in Deepak Kalpoe's car. Holloway, who had been scheduled to fly home later on May 30, did not appear for her return flight.\nEarly investigation.\nOn May 30, 2005, immediately following Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty traveled to Aruba with friends by private jet. Within four hours of landing in Aruba, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with the name and address of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth Twitty has stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends, with two Aruban policemen, went to the Van der Sloot home looking for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, with which Deepak Kalpoe, who was present, agreed. Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because Holloway wanted to see sharks, before dropping Holloway off at her hotel around 2:00\u00a0a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused Van der Sloot's help. He stated that she was then approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards as the young men drove away.\nThe search for physical evidence was extensive and, on occasion, subject to false leads; for example, a possible blood sample taken from Deepak Kalpoe's car was tested but determined not to be blood.\nArrests.\nOn June 9, 2005, Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering Holloway. Aruban law allows for arrest on serious suspicion from investigators; to continue holding the suspect in custody, an increasing evidentiary burden must be met at periodic reviews. According to Dompig, the focus was on these three suspects from the \"get-go\". Dompig stated that surveillance of the three began three days after Holloway was reported missing, and included surveillance, telephone wire taps, and even monitoring of their e-mail. Dompig indicated pressure from Holloway's family caused them to stop their surveillance prematurely and to detain the three suspects. On Monday, July 4, following hearings before a judge, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were released, but Joran van der Sloot was detained for an additional sixty days.\nOn April 15, 2006 Geoffrey von Cromvoirt was arrested by Aruban authorities on suspicion of criminal offenses related to dealing in illegal narcotics that, according to the prosecutor, might have been related to the disappearance of Holloway. At his first court appearance, his detention was extended for eight days. However, Von Cromvoirt was released on April 25, 2006. In addition, another individual with initials \"A.B.\" was arrested on April 22, 2006, but was released the same day.\nOn May 17, 2006 another suspect Guido Wever the son of a former Aruban politician, was detained in the Netherlands on suspicion of assisting in the abducting, battering, and killing of Holloway. Wever was questioned for six days in Utrecht. While initially Aruban prosecutors sought his transfer to the island, he was instead released by agreement between the prosecutor and Wever's attorney.\nWith Aruban investigators citing what was described as newly discovered evidence, Joran van der Sloot and Satish and Deepak Kalpoe were rearrested November 21, 2007, on suspicion of involvement in \"manslaughter and causing serious bodily harm that resulted in the death of Holloway\". Van der Sloot was detained by Dutch authorities in the Netherlands, while the Kalpoe brothers were both detained in Aruba. Van der Sloot subsequently returned to Aruba and was incarcerated.\nIn November 2007, Dave Holloway announced a new search for his daughter, probing the sea beyond the original depths in which earlier searches had taken place. That search, involving a vessel called the \"Persistence\", was abandoned due to lack of funds at the end of February 2008 with nothing of significance found.\nOn November 30, 2007, a judge ordered the release of Satish and Deepak Kalpoe, despite attempts by the prosecution to extend their detention. The two brothers were released on the following day. The prosecution appealed the Kalpoes' release. That appeal was denied on December 5, 2007, with the court writing, \"Notwithstanding expensive and lengthy investigations on her disappearance and on people who could be involved, the file against the suspect does not contain direct indications that Natalee passed away due to a violent crime\". Van der Sloot was released without charge on December 7, 2007, due to lack of evidence implicating him as well as a lack of evidence that Holloway died as the result of a violent crime. The prosecution indicated it would not appeal.\nOn December 18, 2007, prosecutor Hans Mos officially declared the case closed, and that no charges would be filed due to lack of evidence. The prosecution indicated a continuing interest in the Kalpoes and Joran van der Sloot (though they are now no longer legally suspects), and alleged that one of the three, in a chat room message, had stated that Holloway was dead. This was hotly contested by Deepak Kalpoe's attorney, who stated that the prosecution, in translating from Papiamento to Dutch, had misconstrued a reference to a teacher who had drowned as one to Holloway. Attorney Ronald Wix also stated, \"Unless (Mos) finds a body in the bathroom of one of these kids, there's no way in hell they can arrest them anymore\".\nOther case developments.\nOn January 31, 2008, Dutch crime reporter Peter R. de Vries claimed that he had solved the Holloway case. De Vries stated that he would tell all on a special television program on Dutch TV on February 3. Beth Twitty's attorney, John Q. Kelly, told ABC News that he had little faith that the supposed evidence would prove pivotal to the case and suggested that it would be quickly debunked.\nThe broadcast aired February 3, 2008. The broadcast included excerpts from footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones in the vehicle of Patrick van der Eem, a Dutch businessman and ex-con, who gained Van der Sloot's confidence. Van der Sloot was seen smoking marijuana and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. Van der Sloot stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told Van der Sloot to go home and who disposed of the body. An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has subsequently denied Van der Sloot's account, indicating that he was then in Rotterdam at school.\nOn February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot met with Aruban investigators in the Netherlands. Van der Sloot denied that what he said on the tape was true, stating that he was under the influence of marijuana at the time. Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.\nOn March 20, 2009, Dave Holloway flew a search dog to Aruba to search a small reservoir in northern Aruba, previously identified by a supposed witness as a possible location of Natalee's remains. Aruban authorities indicated that they had no new information in the case, but that Holloway had been given permission to conduct the search.\nOn February 23, 2010, it was reported that Joran van der Sloot had stated in an interview (first offered to RTL Group in 2009) that he had disposed of Holloway's body in a marsh on Aruba. New chief prosecutor Peter Blanken indicated that authorities had investigated the latest story, and had dismissed it. Blanken stated that \"The locations, names, and times he gave just did not make sense\".\nAn underwater photograph taken by an American tourist while snorkeling in October 2009 was publicized in March 2010 after the photographer stated that the image depicted something on the sea bed which resembled human remains. Aruban authorities indicated that they would send a dive team to examine the site.\nBeth Twitty's involvement.\nBeth Twitty alleged in televised interviews that Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers know more than they have told, and that at least one of them sexually assaulted or raped her daughter. Twitty has stated that she has received copies of police statements stating that Joran van der Sloot admitted having sex with Holloway at his home and described intimate details of her. She has never released copies of the alleged statement, though she characterizes them as admissions of \"sexual assault\" and Vinda de Sousa, former Holloway\u2013Twitty family Aruban attorney, has indicated that no such admission was made. In addition, Dompig has denied that any such statement was made, stating that Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers consistently denied having sex with Holloway.\nTwitty has been criticized for her focus on Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, to the exclusion of any other theory as to what happened to Holloway. According to the lawsuit filed by the Kalpoe brothers, she has (on various television programs) repeatedly accused them, and Joran van der Sloot, of \"sexual assault\" and \"gang rape\" of her daughter.\nFollowing the airing of the De Vries program, Beth Twitty, adhering to the position that the tapes represent the way events transpired, told the \"New York Post\" that she believes her daughter might still be alive if Van der Sloot had called for help. She contends that Van der Sloot dumped Holloway's body, possibly alive, into the Caribbean. Twitty also alleges that the individual Joran van der Sloot supposedly called that evening was his father, Paulus, who, according to Twitty, \"orchestrated what to do next\". She, and Dave Holloway, alleged that Joran van der Sloot was receiving \"special legal favors\". After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, \"I think that what I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell\", later adding, \"I'd be good with a \"Midnight Express\" prison anywhere for Joran.\nTwitty's book \"Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith\",written under the name \"Beth Holloway\", which she has resumed following her divorce from Jug Twitty, was released on October 2, 2007. The release was accompanied by a number of TV appearances, including a full hour on \"On the Record\". A television movie, titled \"Natalee Holloway\", based in part on Beth Twitty's book, was made by LMN (formerly the Lifetime Movie Network). Twitty has continued to make television appearances when there were new developments in the case.\nLifetime movie.\nIn October 2008, the Lifetime Movie Network (LMN) announced plans to create a television movie, \"The Natalee Holloway Story\", based on Beth Twitty's book \"Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith\". The senior vice president of original movies, Tanya Lopez, stated in the announcement that the network was \"pleased to be working closely with Natalee's mother\" and that they intended to tell the story of Holloway's disappearance \"sensitively and accurately\". The movie was expected to focus on Beth Twitty's involvement in the search for Holloway. The movie, which aired April 19, 2009, under the title \"Natalee Holloway\", stars Tracy Pollan as Beth Holloway, Grant Show as George \"Jug\" Twitty, and Amy Gumenick as Natalee Holloway. The movie brought in the highest television ratings in Lifetime's 11-year history, with average viewership of 3.2 million people and more than 1 million women in the 18-49 age bracket. Although the movie set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie was not received well by critic Alec Harvey of \"The Birmingham News\". Harvey called the movie \"sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months\".\nMedia coverage.\nU.S. television networks devoted much air time to the search for Holloway, the investigation of her disappearance, and rumors surrounding the case. Greta Van Susteren, host of Fox News' \"On The Record\", and Nancy Grace on CNN's \"Headline News\" were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident. Van Susteren's almost continuous coverage of the story caused \"On The Record\" to get its best ratings to date, while Grace's show became the cornerstone of the new \"Headline Prime\" block on Headline News, which ran two episodes (a live show and a repeat) every night during prime-time. As the case wore on, much of the attention was given to Beth Twitty and her statements. Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg stated, \"The case is under a microscope, and the world is watching\". Locally, the Aruban press published extensive news on the story in Dutch, English, and Papiamento.\nThe saturation of coverage triggered a backlash among some critics who argued that such extensive media attention validates the \"missing white woman syndrome\" theory, which argues that missing-person cases involving white skinned women and girls receive disproportionate attention in the media compared with cases involving white males or people of color. CNN ran a segment criticizing the amount of coverage their competitors gave to the story despite what they characterized as a lack of new items to report, with CNN news anchor Anderson Cooper calling the coverage \"downright ridiculous\".\nEarly in the case, political commentator and columnist Arianna Huffington wrote, \"If you were to get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now we can get back to real news. But we never do\".\nIn March 2008, \"El Diario\" commented, \"But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinas, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English-language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latina and African American women often remain faceless, when they are even covered\"."}

It is a term that has contested meanings.\nCommunism and socialism claim to have something defined as liberty for them because of their social equality ideals. Libertarians and classical liberals think communism is against Liberty because communism is most of the times against the individual basic rights (life, freedom and property). \nClassical liberalism conceptions of liberty conceive mainly of the freedom of the individual from outside compulsion in terms of freedom from restraint and social liberalist perspective, on the other hand, highlights the need for social and economic equality, as in the power and resources to fulfill one's potential. As such, a social liberalist connects liberty (i.e. freedom) to the equal distribution of political power (i.e. democracy) in the sense of positive liberty. They argue that liberty without equality means the domination of the most powerful. Thus, freedom and democracy are seen as connected and ultimately, antagonistic.\nJohn Stuart Mill, in his work, \"On Liberty\", was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as not being forced to do something. Mill also sought to define the \"nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual\u201d and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes \"how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control\".\nTypes of freedom.\nThere are mainly ten types of Freedom.

She was born in Tuscumbia, Alabama in 1880 to Arthur H. Keller and Kate Adams Keller. When she was nineteen months old she became sick and lost her eyesight and hearing. The doctor didn't know what it was, so he called it a \"congestion of the stomach and brain.\" Some people say that it was scarlet fever or meningitis. Communicating with other people was hard for Helen, because she could not see or hear. She made up some home signs that she used to communicate with her family. The home signs were quite simple, pull meant \"come\", push meant \"go\" and so on. Sometimes Helen's family did not understand what Helen was meaning with her home signs. That made Helen frustrated and she had temper tantrums. \nWhen Helen was seven years old, her family decided to find a teacher for her. They wrote to Michael Anagnos, who was the director of the Perkins Institute and Asylum for the Blind. They asked him to help them find a teacher for their daughter. He wrote to them and told them that he knew a young teacher and her name was Annie Sullivan. She had been blind, but a series of operations helped to restore her eyesight. Annie traveled to Alabama to live with Helen\u2019s family and to teach her. Annie went to live with the Keller family in March, 1887.\nAnnie helped Helen to learn how to communicate with other people. She taught her the names of things by writing the words on Helen\u2019s hand. At first Helen didn't understand the meaning of the words. The first word Helen understood was \"water\". She learned this word when Annie put Helen's hand under some water and wrote W,A,T,E,R on her hand. Then she learnt the words and sentences with this method. In 1890, Helen\u2019s family sent her to the Perkins Institute to learn how to speak and communicate. When she was nineteen years old, Helen went to Radcliffe College in Massachusetts. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1904. She was the first deaf and blind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.\nIn 1903, Helen wrote a book about her life. It was called \"The Story of My Life\". The movie \"The Miracle Worker\", made in 1962, was based on Helen's book. She also wrote a book about Annie Sullivan called \"Teacher\". She wrote twelve other books.\nHelen tried to help poor people and other blind people during her life. She traveled to over 39 countries with Annie to talk about her life and experiences. When Helen was in Japan, she met Hachiko, a famous Akita. She decided to adopt an Akita, and was the first person to bring an Akita to America.\nHelen Keller wanted to get married. She fell in love with her secretary, but her mother didn't allow Helen to marry him. At that time, disabled people often could not marry. Helen Keller died in her sleep on June 1, 1968, at Arcan Ridge in Connecticut."}

He was sentenced to 30 years in prison but lowered to 16 years on appeal of his court case.\nAlso accused in the case were the girl's 3-month flatmate and college classmate, Amanda Knox, along with her new student boyfriend of 8 days, an Italian young man named Raffaele Sollecito (), who lived in an apartment nearby. Both students had much money in their banks and financial help from parents. They were both held in prison, without bond, for 4 years as they waited on the court judges to re-hear the case until they were found innocent of the crimes. None of their DNA was found anywhere in the girl's locked bedroom, only out in the hallway or other rooms.\nHowever the court continued for over 7 years in again attempting to sentence them, to 26 and 25 years in prison, until they were judged completely innocent in 2014, as the last step in the court legal actions.\nMurder.\nAn American student named Amanda Knox who lived in the house with Kercher, came home the next day. At 12:07\u00a0pm, she called Kercher's local Italian mobile phone, but it rang without being answered for 16 seconds. Then she called another roommate, Filomena R., and said that there were drops of blood in the house and that Kercher did not answer her phone. Knox then tried calling Kercher again two times, but there was still no answer on either her local Italian phone or her UK phone. Immediately, Filomena called back to Knox to say she was coming home, and Knox then announced that Filomena's bedroom window had been broken, with glass all over her clothes and the computer on the floor.\nAfter Filomena had called Knox again, two police officers came to the house because two mobile phones had been found in gardens about one kilometer (0.6 mile) from the house. When Knox had called Kercher (at 12:07\u00a0pm), her phone was found ringing in some garden bushes. It was found by a neighbour who then called the communications police.\nEntering the house, the police noted all the drops of blood that Knox showed them, and they confirmed that Kercher's bedroom door was locked. A friend of Filomena's broke the door to open it. The police looked in the bedroom and found Kercher's body under a duvet (quilt). She was naked except for her T-shirts pulled up to her shoulders. There was a lot of blood on her body and around the room. Someone had stabbed her neck with a knife. Her clothes were laying scattered towards the door. Two credit cards, 300 euros (about US$420), and her house keys were missing.\nArrests.\nThe next day, the police arrested three people. They arrested Knox, her 2-week boyfriend (an Italian student) Raffaele Sollecito. They also arrested Knox's boss at a local pub where she worked but later released him. Sollecito was Knox's new boyfriend, and she had met him just eight days before the murder. Weeks later, police arrested another person called Rudy Guede. Originally from the Ivory Coast, Guede later acquired dual citizenship in Italy. After the murder, he went by train to Germany. Police in Germany caught him and took him back to Italy.\nTrials.\nGuede was put on trial in Italy in October 2008. He was found guilty and sent to prison for 30 years.\nKnox and Sollecito were also put on trial. Sollecito was sent to prison for 25 years, and Knox for 26 years. They both appealed their sentences.\nThe prosecutors said that Guede, Knox and Sollecito killed Kercher together. The lawyers of Knox and Sollecito said that Guede killed her alone, and undressed and moved the body hours later. In June-November 2009, their lawyers presented evidence and witnesses to support a \"lone-wolf\" theory, that Guede killed Kercher and later undressed and moved her body away from the window of her bedroom in the house where she lived with Knox.\nGuede had claimed that he had been invited to her house, as a date planned with Kercher on Halloween. While in her house, he claimed he became sick, and while in the bathroom, he heard a loud scream. In his story, Guede claimed that he saw a brown-haired Italian man holding a knife, over Kercher on the floor of her room. He then claimed that the man fought him, and ran from the house, saying in perfect Italian, \"Trovato negro, trovato colpevole\" (\"found black, found guilty\"). Guede said that he tried to help Kercher, as she was bleeding quickly, but he became scared and ran from the house, without calling the police or anyone for help. Guede had told officials that Kercher was fully dressed when she was stabbed, and he left her with the bed quilt and pillow on her bed. However, witnesses and CSI experts, from the Forensic Police in Rome, presented evidence that contradicted Guede's story about that night:\nAt Guede's trial, the judge and jury did not believe Guede's claims, and they convicted him of the murder. He had been caught because his palm-print on the pillow matched his police file, including the Milan school incident, when Milan police had released him just 5 days before the murder. Guede was sentenced to 30 years in prison, but that was reduced to 16 years after his first appeal trial.\nIn a separate trial, both Knox and Sollecito were tried for the murder, but the evidence was much less than with Guede. No witnesses testified that they had seen or heard Knox or Sollecito enter or leave the house that night. Also, the small amounts of DNA connecting them to the murder were in such low amounts that it could be considered contamination, and such small amounts of DNA are inadmissible during trials in British or U.S. criminal courts. Although numerous shoe prints had been found matching Guede's Nike shoe, there were no shoe prints matching any of the shoes which police had taken from the houses of Knox and Sollecito. The main issues about them were that they said things that seemed suspicious:\nBecause no other witnesses could confirm the couple stayed in his house, during the murder at Knox's house, they were both sent to trial. The evidence against them was very limited:\nWhen Knox was convicted in the first trial, the verdict was questioned by some as \"anti-Americanism\", but Sollecito was also convicted at the same time.\nAppeals.\nGuede appealed against his sentence, and it was changed from 30 to 16 years in prison. He still says that he did not kill Kercher. His second appeal trial ended in December 2010 with upholding the verdict of guilty.\nKnox and Sollecito filed the proper legal documents to appeal their convictions, and they were still considered \"presumed innocent\" as if the previous trial verdicts were suspended. Their appeal trial began in November 2010, with a new judge who ruled to re-examine DNA evidence against them. The judge also granted a re-questioning of witness Antonio C. about which days he saw what.\nOn 3 October 2011, murder convictions against Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were overturned and they were both set free that same night.\nItaly's supreme court ordered a re-trial. The case was heard in Florence, and ended on 30 January 2014. Both Knox and Sollecito were found not-guilty of murder. They were originally sentenced to 28 (Knox) and 26 (Sollecito) years in prison."}

{"id": "78007", "revid": "7837646", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78007", "title": "Lulu (opera)", "text": "Lulu is an opera by the composer Alban Berg. Berg took the story from two plays called \"Erdgeist\" and \"Die B\u00fcchse des Pandora\" by the German playwright Frank Wedekind. Berg wrote the libretto (the words for the opera) himself.\nMany people found \"Lulu\" very shocking because the story is very decadent. There is a lot of blood, murder, sex and violence in it. Also: Berg\u2019s music was quite difficult to understand. He uses twelve tone music, which is not in any particular key, although he uses it to make a style of music which is often very Romantic and expressive.\nComposition.\nBerg started to write the opera in 1929, but then he stopped working on it to write his Violin Concerto. When Berg died, he had not finished the last act of the opera, he had only sketched it. Schoenberg was asked whether he would finish the opera, but he thought it would be too much work. When the opera was first performed in 1937 there were only two acts: the opera was unfinished. Berg\u2019s widow, Helene, said that nobody was allowed to finish it and that it should stay unfinished. For more than 40 years, that is how the opera was performed.\nWhen Helene died in 1976, a man called Friedrich Cerha finished the opera, guessing what Berg might have written. This completed version was performed in 1979 at the Opera Garnier, conducted by Pierre Boulez.\nFamous sopranos who have sung the main part of Lulu include Teresa Stratas, Anja Silja and Christine Sch\u00e4fer.\nThe story.\nPrologue: A circus ringmaster introduces all his animals. The last one is Lulu herself, who is carried on stage and introduced as a snake.\nAct I.\nScene 1: Lulu, the wife of Dr. Goll, an old doctor, is having her portrait painted. Dr. Sch\u00f6n, a newspaper editor who rescued Lulu when she was living in the streets, is now having a love affair with her. Dr. Sch\u00f6n\u2019s son Alwa arrives, excuses himself, and he and Dr. Sch\u00f6n leave. The Painter wants to make love to Lulu. Dr. Goll unexpectedly walks in, sees that the two of them are alone, collapses and dies of a heart attack.\nScene 2: Lulu has now married the Painter. She gets a telegram which says that Dr. Sch\u00f6n is engaged to be married. Schigolch, a tramp, visits her. He seems to have had something to do with her in the past. Dr. Sch\u00f6n arrives. He talks as if Schigolch is Lulu's father. He has come to ask Lulu to stay out of his life from now on. She takes no notice and leaves after her husband, the Painter, arrives. Dr. Sch\u00f6n tells the Painter about their affair, and says he must talk to his wife about it. The Painter leaves, but instead of going to talk to Lulu he cuts his own throat and dies. Lulu does not seem to care and simply tells Dr. Sch\u00f6n \"You'll marry me all the same.\"\nScene 3: Lulu, working as a dancer, is sitting in her dressing room with Alwa. They talk about a Prince who is in love with Lulu and who wants to marry her. Lulu leaves to go on stage, but refuses to go on because Dr. Sch\u00f6n and his fianc\u00e9e are in the audience. Dr. Sch\u00f6n comes in to try to persuade her to perform. When the two are left alone, she tells Sch\u00f6n that she is thinking of leaving with the Prince to go to Africa. Dr. Sch\u00f6n realises that he cannot live without her, and Lulu makes him write a letter to his fianc\u00e9e saying that he does not want to marry her. Lulu carries on with the show.\nAct II.\nScene 1: Lulu has now married Dr. Sch\u00f6n, who is full of jealousy because so many men and one woman seem to love Lulu. One of them, the lesbian Countess Geschwitz, visits her to invite her to a ball, but leaves when Dr. Sch\u00f6n disapproves. When the two go out, the Countess returns and hides. Two other admirers, the Acrobat and the Schoolboy, also enter, and all begin to talk to Lulu when she returns. Alwa arrives, and the admirers hide as Alwa tells Lulu he loves her. Dr. Sch\u00f6n returns, sees the Acrobat, and begins a long argument with Lulu. Gradually he finds the other people who are hiding. He gives Lulu a revolver, and tells her to kill herself, but she shoots Sch\u00f6n instead. The police arrive to arrest Lulu for the murder.\nInterlude: during the music of the interlude a silent movie is shown. In it, we see Lulu being taken by the police, tried in court, and put into prison. Then we see her deliberately getting the illness cholera and being taken to hospital. The Countess Geschwitz visits her, and gives her own clothes, so that Lulu can escape disguised as the Countess.\nScene 2: The Countess Geschwitz, Alwa and the Acrobat are in the same room as Act II, Scene 1. They are waiting for Schigolch, who is to take the Countess to the hospital. She is going to give up her own freedom by taking Lulu's place so that nobody will discover she has escaped until it is too late. The Acrobat says he is going to marry Lulu and move with her to Paris where the two will work in an act together. Schigolch leaves with the countess, then returns with Lulu, who is so ill from her disease that the Acrobat does not follow his plan, but goes off to get the police instead. Schigolch is sent off to buy train tickets, and, left alone, Alwa and Lulu say they love each other and agree to go away together.\nAct III.\nScene 1: Lulu and Alwa are now living in Paris. The scene is a party in a casino. Lulu is being forced by blackmail to work in a Cairo brothel by the Acrobat and a pimp. The police still want her for Dr. Sch\u00f6n's murder and the Acrobat and the pimp say to her that they will take her to the police if she does not do as they say. Schigolch arrives, asking for money. She is persuaded to lure the Acrobat away to a hotel and murder him. After they have gone, news arrives that the railway company has run out of money. The guests have all got money in the company. The party quickly breaks up, and in the confusion, Lulu manages to change clothes with a young man. She escapes with Alwa just before the police arrive to catch her.\nScene 2: Lulu and Alwa are now living with Schigolch. They are poor are in London so that the police cannot find them. Lulu is working as a prostitute. She arrives with a client, a professor (played by the same actor as Dr. Goll, Lulu's first husband). The Countess Geschwitz then arrives with a portrait of Lulu which she has brought from Paris. Alwa hangs it on the wall. Lulu goes out, and returns with another client, the Negro (played by the same actor as the Painter, Lulu's second husband). He refuses to pay before making love, and kills Alwa in a struggle. Schigolch takes the body away while Geschwitz thinks about killing herself, but then gives up the idea when she realises that Lulu does not care. Eventually, Lulu goes out and comes back with a third client (played by the same actor as Dr. Sch\u00f6n, Lulu's third husband). He argues over the price, and is about to leave when Lulu decides she will sleep with him for less than her usual fee. This client, who is actually Jack the Ripper, murders Lulu, and then on his way out kills the Countess as well, who swears her love to Lulu as the curtain comes down.\nStructure.\nThe shape of the whole opera is often said to be like a mirror \u2013 Lulu's popularity in the first act is mirrored by the poverty she lives in during Act III. Also, Lulu's husbands in Act I are played by the same singers as her clients in Act III. In the middle of the opera is the movie. Even some of the music is a palindrome (it reads the same forwards as backwards). This can be seen at the very middle of the Act II movie Interlude, when a piano plays a rising pattern of notes, which then reverses direction and falls. \nSome of the characters have their own music which, in each case, is a theme made of twelve notes. This is the twelve-tone system which was invented by Berg\u2019s teacher Arnold Schoenberg. By giving each character a theme, he is using the idea of a leitmotif, which was used a lot by Wagner. This can be heard in Scene I of Act II, when Lulu sings a dramatic solo telling Dr. Sch\u00f6n she has never pretended to be anything other than what she is. The first twelve syllables (If men have killed themselves for my sake...) that she sings are set to her leitmotif."}

They are a sister group to those fish which evolved into tetrapods.

However, fisherman in the Comoros islands had been catching it for a very long time and called it \"gombesa\".\nCharacteristics.\nThe coelacanths are the closest link between fish and the first amphibians which made the transition from sea to land in the Devonian period (408\u2013362 million years ago). Whereas the fishapods lived near the shore in muddy water, the coelacanths lived in open water. The modern species are predators that live in the deep ocean.\n\"Latimeria\".\n\"Latimeria\" is the only living genus of the otherwise fossil coelacanth fish.

That such a creature could have been unrecorded for so long is rare, but perhaps the cold depths of the West Indian ocean (in which the Coelacanth lives), and the few predators it has, may have helped the species survive. Its disgusting taste means that fishermen did not deliberately try to catch it, that is, before scientists started offering rewards.\nThe population living off Tanzania is threatened by Japanese trawlers, but the fish is not edible. They are simply caught in trawls by accident. More than 20 have died this way, and their total numbers cannot be large.\nScientific study.\n\"Latimeria\" was first found by scientists in 1938 by Marjorie Courtenay Latimer, the curator of a small museum in the South African port town of East London. She was visiting a fisherman who would let her search through his boat's catch for interesting specimens. Another one was found off the Comoros islands in 1952. The largest specimen was about 1.8 metres (~6\u00a0ft). "}

Informal tent cities may be set up without authorization by homeless people or protesters. As well, state governments or military organizations set up tent cities to house refugees, evacuees, or soldiers. Tent cities set up by homeless people may be similar to shanty towns, which are informal settlements in which the buildings are made from of scrap building materials.\nEnvironmental disasters and homeless people.\nSince Hurricane Katrina made landfall in August of 2005, the term has been used to describe temporary housing sites set up for Gulf Coast residents who were left homeless by the storm. Some of the tents that were built by Seabees and funded by FEMA are wooden structures covered by tents. With the exception of indoor plumbing, most of the tents have heat, air, and lights. The tent city can hold as many as 250 occupants. Displaced residents are only expected to stay for three to six months. In late December 2006, the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Saint Petersburg, Florida established an encampment on their property when dozens of homeless moved off of public land across the street from the society. In early January 2007, city officials noted city codes that prohibit living in tents and gave the society one week to evict the occupants of the tent city. \nFor travelers on The Hajj to Mecca.\nEvery year, the Saudi Arabian government's Ministry of Hajj sets up a tent city to support Muslim pilgrims in the village of Mina, where the ritual Stoning of the Devil takes place as part of the overall Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. A tent city is also established annually at Mount Arafat, another essential stop during the Hajj. Because up to four million pilgrims may be performing the Hajj annually, the tent cities are densely inhabited with 20-40 people per tent. As such, fire and disease outbreaks are constant concerns. Since the late 1990s, Saudi authorities have started using fireproof tents to reduce the risks of a major fire.\nMilitary uses.\nIn the military, the term \"tent city\" usually refers to temporary living quarters erected on deployed military bases, such as those found in Bosnia or Iraq. Depending on the branch of service and the length the tent city has been in place, the living space may have most modern amenities. For sanitary reasons, military tent cities place toilet, shower, and laundry facilities at least 50 feet (15m) from living quarters. Also, tents are typically divided into clusters of 8-10 to prevent the rapid spread of fire, which is of utmost concern because of the tent and bedding materials."}

Many Christian theologians have called humanity \"homo adorans\", which means \"worshipping man,\" and so the worship of God is at the very centre of what it means to be human. \nHistory.\nOverview.\nThroughout most centuries of Church history, Christian worship has been primarily liturgical, symbolised by prayers and hymns, whose texts were closely related to, the Scripture. Set times for prayer during the day were made (based mostly on Jewish models), and a festal cycle throughout the Church year pointed out the celebration of feasts and holy days relating to the events in the life of Jesus, the lives of the saints, and features of the Church's view of God. \nA large amount of importance was placed on the forms of worship, as they were seen in terms of the Latin phrase \"lex orandi, lex credendi\" (\"the rule of prayer is the rule of belief\") \u2014 that is, the details of someone's worship show, teach, and govern the principle beliefs of the community. To change the patterns and content of worship were to change the faith itself. So even though there was always a certain amount of variety in the early Church's liturgical worship, there was also a great deal of unity. Each time a heresy appeared in the Church, it normally came by a shift in worship for the heretical group. Orthodoxy in faith also meant orthodoxy in worship, and vice versa.\nEarly Church Fathers.\nThe very early development of Christian worship is lost in history, but Christian worship is, normally, fixed in the worship of Judaism. The Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles present the very early Christians as visiting both the Temple and synagogues, as well as worshipping in private homes, frequently to \"break bread,\" a term which signifies both the sharing of a meal and, when used in that context, celebrating the Eucharist. Acts 2:42 shows the very early Church of Jerusalem as \"continuing in the Apostles' teaching and fellowship [or communion], the breaking of bread, and the prayers.\"\nContemporary worship.\nIn general, worship for the Eastern churches and for the Catholic and Anglican churches in the West is centered in regular celebration of the Lord's Supper, celebrated by a priest with more or less participation from the whole body of believers that are there. This tradition, variously known as the Mass, Divine Liturgy, Eucharist or Communion, continues in the Anglican church and among some Protestants. A worship service in these traditions is centered on the sharing of bread (or bread and wine) although it also includes prayer, the reading of Scripture, and usually singing and some form of teaching or sermon.\nIn many Protestant traditions, however, Communion is celebrated rarely or not at all, and corporate worship is centered on a formal sermon, which may resemble a lecture. Worship in such a context also generally is described by spoken prayer, Scripture, and music, mainly hymns.\nIn virtually all Christian traditions, this regular public worship is accompanied by other forms of worship, such as prayer and study, small group prayer (often linked with Bible study), and formal ceremonies on special occasions, including weddings, funerals and events of Church or state.\nHolidays and seasons.\nThe most popular religious holidays in the Christian calendar are Christmas, which is after the Advent season, and Easter, which is after Lent and Holy Week. While Christmas is very popular, especially in Western countries, Easter is liturgically by far the most important celebration."}

She died on her honeymoon on the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Australia in 2003. She had only been married to her husband, David Gabriel \"Gabe\" Watson, for 11 days when she died. The doctor who performed the autopsy said she drowned in a scuba diving accident. \nSix years later, Gabe Watson was charged for murder and manslaughter. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sent to prison for a year by an Australian court. Six months were added to the prison sentence after an appeal that took place just six weeks later. The appeal was held as soon after the trial as possible because of concerns raised by Tina's father with the trial itself. However, the appeal judges had agreed with the trial judge on most of the issues except the six month increase in the prison sentence.\nTina was a Southern Baptist and a graduate of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). She worked as a departmental manager at the small Southern department store chain, Parisian. She was buried at the Southern Heritage Cemetery, in Pelham, Alabama, USA.\nInvestigations.\nWhile scuba diving at the site of the SS \"Yongala\", a passenger ship that sank in 1911 in the main southern shipping channel to the Australian port of Townsville, Tina Watson either lost consciousness or died and then sank to the sea floor below. Tina's death of accidental drowning was not a criminal investigation in itself in Australia. It was a coronial enquiry. Mr Watson gave evidence to the Coronial Inquiry through his lawyers. He returned to Australia voluntarily and spoke to investigators on a number of occasions. Some of these interviews are available on the Internet. At trial, prosecutors said that Mr Watson had made a mistake in not trying to rescue his wife. They said that mistake was the same as manslaughter (see: Court of Appeal Judgement). Tina's father that, immediately before their wedding, Gabe had asked Tina to increase her life insurance policy to the maximum possible and make him the sole beneficiary.\nAfter hearing that flowers and gifts left for Tina at her grave were being destroyed or were disappearing, even when held down by a chain, Sergeant Flynn investigated it. On a hidden videotape, he saw Gabe Watson taking them away with bolt cutters and then throwing them in the trash angrily. Gabe then married Kim Lewis on August 15, 2008.\nThe trial.\nGabe Watson was tried for the murder of his wife, Christina, in the Queensland Supreme Court at Brisbane on 5 June 2009. He said he was \"not guilty\" of murdering his wife. To the charge of manslaughter, accidental killing, he said he was guilty. The trial judge said the murder charges made against him were not true and sentenced him to one year in prison, with a further three and a half years suspended. This sentence resulted into Tina's father calling the Australian justice system a \"sham\". He also said one of Australia's most senior government lawyers, Mr Tony Moynihan, had been misleading the public.\nThe reason Gabe received the one year in prison, was explained by the judge. He said that Gabe had been accused of things of which he had not been guilty, had suffered considerably since Tina's death, and had co-operated with the Court. He said the media reporting had been unfair. The judge said Gabe had come back to Australia of his own free will in May of 2009 and given himself up. The judge said Gabe loved his wife, deeply regretted her death and felt guilty because he had been unable to save her. He said that Gabe had not caused the accident, but had failed to save Tina when she ran into difficulty with her breathing while underwater.\nThe appeal.\nThree judges heard an appeal started by the State of Queensland on 17 July, 2009. The state wanted Gabe to serve two and a half years in prison. Gabe's Australian lawyers said the extra time was unfair because of the history of the case. The judges published their decision on 18 September, 2009.\nTo understand the outcome of the appeal, it is necessary to understand a little of the legal process and thinking that lawyers put into an appeal. On one side we have the State of Queensland, Australia. In Australia, as in England and countries such as Canada and New Zealand, the State is usually called the \"Crown\" in court proceedings. In the US, the State is usually referred to as \"The People\" or simply the \"State\". The appeal was heard before three judges of the Queensland Court of Appeal, which is the State's highest court.\nThe outcome of the appeal.\nThe Crown had said that Gabe's sentence should be increased because it believed the sentence was wrong. Gabe's lawyers replied this was not the case. They said that Gabe had never done anything wrong in the past and he was a good person. The death of Tina resulted from an error or mistake, and the short prison sentence was a fair in his lawyers' opinions.\nThe Court of Appeal judges also said that the murder claim was not true. The judges were in agreement about most of the trial. However they did not agree about the prison sentence. On one hand, Justice Muir said the appeal court should not change the decision of the trial judge. On the other, Chief Justice De Jersey said prison time should be increased to two and a half years. In the third opinion, Justice Chesterman said it ought to be increased from twelve months to eighteen months. To reach agreement, the Chief Justice went with Chesterman's opinion.\nWith the agreement of two of the three judges, the sentence was increased to eighteen months. Each judge carefully explained their view. Finally, Chesterman said of Gabe Watson, \"That the respondent himself promptly provided the information which proved the case against him and that for years he has borne the unjust charge, made very public, of murder are factors requiring substantial amelioration in sentence.\" (Gabe Watson gave the information which showed he had killed his wife accidentally. Because he was for many years unfairly blamed and unfairly accused for her murder, he should have his prison sentence shortened.)\nMedia attention.\nFor four years, no one took much notice of the death, as there is a drowning in the Australian state of Queensland about once a week. Tina's parents however, set out to get the attention of the media and by 2007 had succeeded. Other people had been diving near Gabe and Tina when Tina died. One diver had photographed Tina, lying on the ocean floor, while taking a picture of another diver on holiday. This picture was not known until a couple of weeks later when the pictures were developed. Investigators were uncertain if Tina was already dead in the picture or if she was unconscious. The picture gives no clues as to what made Tina sink to the bottom.\nAfter being informed by Tina Watson's family that flowers and gifts were repeatedly being vandalized or disappearing from the grave site, even when chained down, Sergeant Flinn investigated. On hidden surveillance videos, he saw Gabe Watson removing them with bolt cutters and putting them into the trash, which Flinn then showed to media.\nTina Watson's father told the media in November 2009, two months after the appeal decision, that he thinks Gabe is a copycat killer. He might have got the idea for the murder by a copying the way another, almost successful, murder was done in the British Virgin Islands.\nThe death of Tina Watson was shown in a 90-minute account that was shown on \"Dateline NBC\" on Monday, May 19, 2008. Watson's death caused media attention in both Australian and American media and also from media around the world because of the unusual case.\nHowever, media in particular from the Australian state of Queensland, have continually described Tina's death as \"murder\" while Queensland Courts have found it to be manslaughter by way of a failure to rescue. This issue finally came to a head with the \"Townsville Bulletin\" on 10 February 2010. They again described Tina's death as \"murder\". Seven days later they published an apology and correction which says:\nOn July 17, 2010 a leading Australian daily newspaper, \"The Age\", published a complete review of the Watson case \"Death on Reef Mystery\". The author was award-winning investigative journalist Peter Patrick. This is the first media account to contain first-hand interviews from both Gabe Watson's family and Tina's family. Relying on technical experts, the story reports that Gabe was exonerated by the Queensland Court of Appeal of murder but convicted of failing to comply with a previously unused and little-known part of the Queensland Penal Code. This is a violation of section 290. He says the court decided to call this manslaughter. The story says the charge amounts to a crime by Gabe of failing to rescue his wife, once she got into trouble. It also explains Tina's extensive history of heart irregularity and the medication she was taking, on the morning of her death, including anti-sea-sickness pills. Patrick says that Tina gave a 'no' answer to the medical question at her diving induction, which asked about prior heart disease. He also states that because Mr. Watson had been absent from diving for some years, his level of rescue skill would have been that of beginner.\nThe story would eventually have worldwide ramifications, for in a footnote, Patrick revealed he had written to Australia's Attorney General, Robert McClelland MP, requesting Watson not be deported to Alabama, because of the risk he faced from the death penalty in that state and because he had already been tried in the Australian State of Queensland, with a comprehensive review by the Queensland Court of Appeal. This brought an instant response from an Alabama police web site, questioning the link between the journalist and Mr. Watson.\nBail application.\nOn December 15, 2010, Watson appeared before Judge Tommy Nail in the 10th Judicial Circuit, Jefferson County, Alabama and requested bail.\nThe courtroom was packed with his friends and relatives, both Australian and U.S. media with a smaller showing from Tina's family.\nDon Valeska Alabama's assistant attorney general, told the judge the basis of the Grand Jury indictment of Gabe Watson was evidence from Tommy Thomas that Gabe Watson had murdered Tina Watson for insurance money.\nIn often heated argument, Judge Nail said that motive could not be substituted for evidence. He asked what hard evidence the State had against Watson. Mr Valeska replied that the question of motive was a question for the jury.\nAfter an hour-long hearing, Watson was granted bail with a bond of $100,000. He had to wear a monitoring radio bracelet, surrender his passport, not leave Alabama, and remain indoors at his home from sundown to sunup during the bail.\nOn hearing that bail was to be granted, those in the courtroom rose and cheered, causing Judge Nail to respond with the words, \"Sit-down, sit-down; this is not a spectator sport.\"\nArraignment.\nOn January 31, 2011, Gabe Watson appeared in Judge Nail's court to formally answer two charges: firstly, that he had kidnapped Tina and taken her to Australia with the intention of murdering her, and secondly, that he had then murdered her while Scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef.\nHe pleaded \"Not Guilty\" to both charges.\nThe trial date was set for 23 May 2011 (later changed to 13 February 2012 due to security concerns). Mr Valeska told Judge Nail that important witnesses were to be flown in from Australia. He then added that a previous witness Mr David Glasgow, the Queensland Magistrate who was the Australian official responsible for Gabe's indictment of murder in Australia, would not now be called. No reason was given as to the reason why the State had changed its mind on calling Mr Glasgow. The arraignment lasted just fourteen minutes.\nGabe Watson acquitted.\nOn February 23, 2012, the case against David Gabriel \"Gabe\" Watson was dismissed by Judge Tommy Nail in a Birmingham, Alabama County Court. The Judge found the State's case lacked credibility and said, \"It just doesn't make any sense quite frankly.\"\nIn concluding his findings, His Honor determined, \"There is no evidence to suggest that he [Gabe] intended to kill her and he hatched it here and carried it out there. I'm going to grant this defendant's motion. Case dismissed.\"\nWatson was never at risk of facing the death penalty as both the U.S. Government and the State of Alabama had given undertakings to the Australian Government, he would not be executed. He faced a mandatory life sentence, if found guilty.\nFatal Honeymoon - Lifetime Movie Network.\nOn 25 August 2012, The Lifetime Movie Network ran a cable TV movie titled, \"Fatal Honeymoon\".\nIt was billed by the Network as a movie, based on the true-story murder allegations that Gabe Watson had kidnapped then murdered his new wife, Tina Watson, during their scuba-diving trip to Australia in 2003. It stars Billy Miller as Gabe Watson and Aussie Amber Clayton as Tina, with Harvey Keitel in a supporting role as the father of the dead bride. Well-known Aussie actor, Gary Sweet plays tough Queensland cop Detective Campbell, as the lead Australian investigator.\nThe screenplay follows much of the work of Lindsay Simpson and Jennifer Cooke, published in their book, \"Honeymoon Dive\", and seems based on this title. While this work remains the most comprehensive attempt to review the death of Tina Watson, current events since publication have largely overtaken the Simpson/Cooke account of the fatality.\n\"Fatal Honeymoon\" was directed by Nadia Tass. The screenwriters were Mac Gudgeon and Teena Booth.\nGeoff Berkshire, writing for Variety TV Reviews says of the screenplay, \"There's no sense that these stick figures trapped in a by-the-numbers melodrama could be real people swept up in tragic circumstances...Tech credits are in line with low-budget telepic standards.\"\nSimilarly, Jill O'Rourke in a review on the website \"Crushable\", describes \"Fatal Honeymoon\" as a show, underscoring Lifetime's skill at \"making men look irredeemably evil and women look like clueless victims\"."}

It ended Sunday 23 July in Paris. The distance of the race was 3657 km (2272 mi). The race was the third fastest in average speed. Along the way, the cyclists passed through six different countries including France, The Netherlands (a stop at Valkenburg in Stage 3), Belgium (at Huy, Stages 3 and 4), Luxembourg (at Esch-sur-Alzette, Stages 2 and 3), Germany (though not stopping there, Stage 1) and Spain (Pla-de-Beret, Stage 11). For the first time since the 1999 race, there was no team time trial.\nOne day before the start of the Tour, there was a doping scandal. 13 racers were removed from the Tour, because it was believed that they were getting drugs from a doctor named Fuentes. Two of the 13 riders were the expected to do well in the race. They were Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso."}

They were the richest family in Europe for many years. Many leaders of Florence during the Renaissance were Medicis. The Medicis were important because they ran many banks, including the most important bank in Europe. They were so powerful they became like a royal family. 4 popes of the Catholic Church were from the Medici. Their names were Pope Leo X (the 10th), Pope Clement VII(the 7th), Pope Pius IV (the 4th), and Pope Leo XI (the 11th) 2 Queens of France were from the medici- Catherine de\u2019 Medici and Marie de\u2019 Medici.The heir to the Tuscan throne was traditionally known as the Grand Prince.\nThe family ruled the state with the title of Grand Duke of Tuscany.\nFlorence and the Medici.\nGiovanni Bicep de' Medici, (1360-1429), was the first important member of the family. He invested his money very wisely and became rich. He and his son, Cosmo de' Medici, (1389-1464), began the Medici Banking Company, which did so well that they soon had branches of the bank in large cities all over Europe, including London and Paris. Giovanni Bicep and Cosmo were the richest men in Europe, and their family was politically the most powerful in Florence. \nFlorence already had an industry, the cloth industry. Florentine merchants (traders) traded with Lombard traders from the north of Italy. They bought English wool and Chinese silk to be woven into the most magnificent cloth in Europe at the riverside factories of Florence. Florence was perfectly sited for making cloth. A lot of water is needed to make cloth. Other towns nearby are high on the tops of hills, but Florence is in a wide valley, with the broad Arno River flowing through it. There was a harbor on the coast near Pisa. The Pisans were not very friendly towards Florence, so Florence took them over. Then the rich traders of Florence could have their own ships and did not have to worry about the Lombard traders who brought their goods across Europe and over the mountains on the backs of donkeys.\nCosimo de' Medici was a patriot and a patron. He was a \"patriot\" because he acted like a father to his city. He became part of the town council. They were a group of men called the \"signorina\" (the seniors or elders). Cosimo made laws that adjusted the taxes. Some of the rich people did not like this at all and left the city, making Cosimo more powerful. He took good care of industry, of trade and of farming, because Florence needed all these things. He particularly needed the loyalty of all the farms and villages, because a city in a valley is easy for an army to attack. Cosimo built public buildings and when he had a palace built for himself, he had long stone seats built along the walls for the poor and the elderly to sit on.\nHe was a patron because he supported the church, and lots of writers, artists, architects and students. He founded a \"Platonic Academy\" where students could study the works of Ancient Greek writers and talk about politics, religion and new ideas. The head of the Academy was a philosopher called Marsillio Ficino. Cosimo encouraged architects to design buildings in the style of Ancient Rome. He collected a huge library of books and gave them to the monastery of San Lorenzo to be used by students. When he wanted some quiet time, he went to friary, (which is like a monastery), Sant Marco's, where he encouraged one of the \"brothers\", Fra Angelico, to paint beautiful sacred pictures.\nAfter the death of Cosimo, his grandson Lorenzo de' Medici became even more famous. He was called Lorenzo il Magnifico (the Magnificent). It was during the time of Lorenzo that some of the most famous artists in world history were alive in Florence, and worked for the Medici:- Botticelli, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci."}

He is the first man to have thought the stars we see at night are identical in nature to the Sun. For publishing beliefs contrary to Roman Catholic dogma about transubstantiation, trinity and other matters, he was burnt at the stake as a heretic by the Inquisition of the Roman Catholic Church.\nBruno also wrote extensive works on the art of memory, a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles.\nThe charges.\nThe Catholic Church made the following accusations against Bruno:\nBruno did accept and promote Copernicus' idea that the Earth revolves round the Sun. Many believe this was one of main reasons for his downfall; others think his theological beliefs were more critical. In 1584 he published two dialogues which argued for his idea on astronomy. Eight years later he was arrested, and his trial took another eight years. His accusers demanded complete recantation of all his 'erroneous' beliefs. He refused, and went to his death.

{"id": "78183", "revid": "7672139", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78183", "title": "Wheel of Fortune (US game show)", "text": "Wheel of Fortune is a game show on television. It was created by Merv Griffin in 1975. It was first hosted by Chuck Woolery from 1975 until 1981. Pat Sajak has been hosting the show since 1981 and Susan Stafford and Vanna White replaced in 1982. The show has been aired in syndicated format since 1983. The show is currently in its 38th season on September 14, 2020.\nIntroduction.\nThree contestants compete. The game combines the game of hangman with a prize wheel. At the beginning of the show, there is a $1,000 Toss-Up puzzle. During a Toss-Up puzzle, one letter at a time appears on the board. Contestants can ring in to solve the puzzle before the last letter is revealed. An incorrect solution locks out that contestant for the rest of that Toss-Up. New it Call Triple Toss Up on September 9 2019 Same $2,000 in September 2020 New Thing in Toss Up &amp; Triple Toss Up in Season 37/Season 38\nNext, a second Toss-Up is worth $2,000 and determines who starts round one. There are 24 spaces on the wheel. A contestant who lands on a cash space is credited with that amount multiplied by how many of a particular letter is in the puzzle. A contestant can buy a vowel for $250. A, E, I, O, and U are the 5 Vowels.\nAny contestant who lands on Lose a Turn loses his or her turn but not the winnings they have earned during the round. Landing on Free Spin space means they must guess a letter in the puzzle to earn it. If a contestant lands on Bankrupt, he or she will lose all of his or her winnings they have earned during the current round as well as a Wild Card, or any prizes they have at that point, plus loss of turn (unless they possess the Free Spin). The Wild Card is used to call for another consonant while the wheel is still on the cash space a contestant landed on. Also on the wheel are two \"1/2 Car\" tags. If a contestant wins a round with both tags, they win a car. Both tokens offer $500 per letter if claimed. There is also a prize wedge and a Gift Tag. The prize wedge is a prize announced before the first round. To win it, a contestant has to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle without hitting Bankrupt. The Gift Tag is $1,000 credit for purchases from a company. Both tokens offer $500 per letter if claimed. In the first three rounds, there is a special $1,000,000 wedge that, if claimed and brought to the bonus round, allows the contestant a chance to play for $1,000,000 in the bonus round. If a contestant lands on Free Play, the contestant can do anything without any risk. They can buy a vowel even if they have no money. If they do have money, the vowel is free. If they call a letter that is not in the puzzle, they don't lose their turn. They can even choose to solve the puzzle, and if they're wrong, they don't lose their turn. A consonant on the Free Play is worth $500. The top dollar value on the wheel is $2,500 in round one, $3,500 in the second and third rounds, and $5,000 from the fourth round on.\nIn round two, two mystery wedges are added to the wheel. One hides $10,000 and the other hides a Bankrupt. A contestant who lands on a mystery wedge calls for a letter. He or she may take $1,000 per letter occurrence or turn over the wedge. The $10K is a cash prize, and it can only be won if the person who has it solves the puzzle without landing on Bankrupt. If one wedge was turned over, the other acts as a regular $1,000 space and cannot be turned over. Round three is the Prize Puzzle round. The contestant who solves the puzzle wins a prize. Also in round three is an Express wedge. If a contestant lands on this wedge and calls a correct letter, they can continue playing the game like normal, or choose to play for $1,000 per letter without spinning. If a contestant chooses to play for $1,000 per letter without spinning and calls a wrong letter, or takes too long to call a letter, it will count as a Bankrupt.\nStarting in Season 37, there is a Triple Toss-Up, in which there are three consecutive puzzles worth $2,000 apiece and under the same category. The third puzzle determines who starts Round 4. When time runs short, a bell sounds. The host spins the wheel. Remaining consonants are worth $1,000 plus the value in front of the left-most contestant. The contestants take turns calling for letters. A vowel can be called at no cost. Then, the contestant in control has three seconds to solve\nThe contestant with the most cash at the end of the game advances to the bonus round. If the game ends in a tie, another toss-up puzzle is played to determine who goes to the bonus round. The contestant who wins the game gets to pick from one of three categories for the bonus round, starting in Season 35. The contestant spins the bonus wheel, which has 24 prizes, just like the main wheel. The category is announced. A bonus puzzle is revealed. The contestant is given the letters R, S, T, L, N, and E. In the early 1970s and on the 1988 Present Season 6, the contestant then calls for three more consonants and a vowel. If a contestant has a Wild Card in the bonus round, a fourth consonant is called. Then, the contestant has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle. If the puzzle is solved, the contestant wins the prize that they landed on. If they don't, then the board shows the correct answer. The host then shows the prize in the envelope regardless of the result. Prizes include cash amounts ranging from $35,000 to $50,000 in $5,000 amounts, again, prior to season 35, a car with $5,000 cash, and a top prize of $100,000. If the Million Dollar Wedge is bought to the bonus round, the $100,000 envelope is replaced with a $1,000,000 one."}

It is also used as a method of greeting like \"hello\" and \"goodbye\".\nSimilar to its use in English, it can mean peace between two persons or entities. It also means inner peace, being calm or the quietness of a person, well-being, welfare or safety of an individual or a group. \nThe root of the word \"shalom\" can be related to \"shalem\" which means \"wholeness\", or to \"le-shalem\" which means \"to complete, to reward, to pay, to compensate\". This means that it is more than the absence of conflict or struggle or the breaking of unfriendliness: It also means a return to the balance, to justice, and to the complete equality.\nIn general, one uses the word \"shalom\" as the short form of the sentence \"Shalom Aleichem\" (exactly \"Peace is with you\") that can be translated as \"good day (morning, afternoon, high noon...)\" (a greeting). This is very similar to the Arabic phrase \"Salam Alaykum\" (\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643\u0645) which is again a greeting meaning \"Peace be with you\"."}

The colony was later called New England and what is now the cities of Salem and Boston. The Bay Colony also included what is now known as the States of Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\nJohn Winthrop, the founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, continued to work on the colony, and improve it any possible way. He knew that the Church of England was bad, so he decided to improve it at the New World; either colonizing the natives or getting rid of them.\nThere were two companies who brought settlers in the New World. The first company was the Dorchester Company but was a failure. The second company was in 1628 and called the Massachusetts Bay Colony. This was successful and brought approximately 20,000 people to the Colony.\nAt first the colonists had a good friendship with the Native Americans but as more Europeans moved to these areas there were problems over land borders. The Native Americans also had many different customs. These differences led first to the Pequot War (1636\u20131638), and then to King Philip's War (1675\u20131676). After these wars, the Native Americans became peaceful and others moved to different places.\nThe colony was doing well and made money trading with England. They also traded with the West Indies. In 1686 there was a civil war in England. King James II wanted to have total control over the colonies. After the war, the colonies remained the same until 1692. Then Sir William Phips arrived and Massachusetts Bay and the Plymouth Colony were combined. The colonists helped in the running of the government and how it would spend its money.\nEarlier times.\nFrom the earliest times many Native American lived in this area. They farmed and hunted within their own land borders and did not cross each other's land. Early in the 1600s, explorers, Samuel de Champlain and John Smith made a map of the area.\nLiving in the New World was very hard work for the first settlers. Many became ill and died though the cold winter. There was not enough food, and the rest of the people decided to return to England after one year. For awhile there was no more talk of settling people in those parts. English ships did still come to the New England area for fishing and trading with the Indians.\nPlymouth Colony.\nIn November 1620, a group of Europeans arrived and started Plymouth Colony. Other settlements were tried near there but they failed and the people either joined the Plymouth Colony, returned to England, or lived nearby the Colony.\nThe people of Plymouth faced many problems during the first years and could not pay back their investors. In 1627 the companies left the colonists to take care of themselves. Edward Winslow and William Bradford, two of its leaders, wrote about the \"Mayflower\" and the colony they created, called Plymouth Colony. It was published in England in 1622 called \"Mourt's Relation\". The two men have different opinions but it was written to encourage people to come to the New World to live."}

The adults live mostly on the sea floor, in the littoral zone.\nFeeding.\nThe sea squirt has two openings in its small body. One opening, called the \"oral siphon\", sucks water into the animal; the other opening, called the \"atrial siphon\", squirts water out of the animal. Inside is a little basket-like sieve which traps food: so these sea squirts are filter feeders. The Sea squirt can close the holes in its siphons, like a drawstring can close the opening in a bag. \nLife cycle.\nWhen in its larval state, it looks like a tadpole and is sometimes called a \"tadpole larva\". Like many sea creatures, a sea squirt larva looks very different from an adult sea squirt. The larva swims for a short time and then attaches itself to something on the sea floor, like a rock, transforming into its adult form. It usually stays in one place for the rest of its life.\nRelationships.\nTunicates are more closely related to craniates (hagfish, lampreys, jawed vertebrates) than to lancelets, echinoderms, hemichordates, or other invertebrates.\nDiscoveries.\nChemical substances which might help fight diseases like cancer or various viruses have been found in some species. \nScientists have also found out that some species can heal some damage done to them, over several generations. A similar process might be possible for humans."}

He lived during the Ming Dynasty. Zheng He was the leader of a very large fleet of ships that traveled all over the Indian Ocean and Southwest Asia. Zheng He was an eunuch of China's Imperial Court. The fleet that Zheng He commanded had 317 ships that were very large. 28,000 Chinese soldiers were on board these ships.\nEarly life.\nZheng He was born in Kunyang, a village in Yunnan. He was born with the name Ma He (Chinese \u9a6c\u4e09\u5b9d). He and his family were Muslim. At the time, Yunnan was ruled by Mongols. In 1381, however, a Ming army invaded and took control of the area.\nMa He was taken as a prisoner by the Ming armies. He was about 10 years old. He was castrated and then taken away to serve the Prince, Zhu Di (the future emperor). Ma He became a servant at the Imperial Court. The name Zheng He was given to him by the Prince. He also came to be called \"Sanbao\", a reference to the Three Jewels of Buddhism.\nJourneys.\nFrom 1405 to 1433, Zheng He went on seven journeys to the Indian Ocean, or what the Chinese people called the \"Western Ocean\". He was the leader of a large fleet of ships and a big army.\nIn his first three journeys he visited the countries of Southeast Asia, India and Sri Lanka. In his fourth to seventh journeys he went as far as the east African coast. In his journeys he gave the countries he visited gifts of silk, porcelain, gunpowder and other goods. He got lots of unusual gifts as well, including giraffes and zebras.\nHe had his first journey from 1405\u20131407, but it is not known why the journey was made. He travelled from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Vietnam, as well as the south of India. His fleet was made up of 317 ships, more than 27,000 men, and the cargo included porcelain, silk, and lacquerware. He used a treasure fleet which is known as the largest wooden ships ever built, being long, and about wide. On his first voyage, he defeated a famous pirate in the Strait of Malacca.\nFor the next 28 years, Zheng He traveled on six more voyages. From 1407\u20131409, he visited Calicut, Thailand and Java. From 1409\u20131411, he saw Ayutthaya, Malaya, Sumatra and Sri Lanka. From 1413\u20131415, he went to Sri Lanka, Bengal, India, Hormuz, Arabia and Aden. On his fifth journey, from 1417\u20131419, he visited the Ryukyu Islands, Brunei, and east Africa. Then from 1421\u20131422, he expanded on his fifth journey. His final journey, from 1433\u20131435, he revisited many of the previous places and brought back gifts from many rulers.\nZheng He visited over 30 countries, and is believed to have died in 1433 on the journey home during the final treasure fleet voyage. After Zheng He died at sea in 1433, his treasure fleet quickly faded, even though his voyages had been a success. Less than 100 years after his death, all of the ships from China were destroyed."}

He found a well-preserved skull of a young australopithecine, three to four years old. This skull is often called the Taung Child, after Taung, South Africa where it was found. It is perhaps the most complete skull of \"A. africanus\" known. Based on current data \"A. africanus\" dates to between 3.03 and 2.04 million years ago.\n\"Australopithecus africanus\" had a dish shaped facial structure with teeth that were large compared to modern humans. While it had larger front teeth compared to the back, the emphasis was on back tooth grinding. Males had a sagital crest on the tops of their skulls. Large muscles were attached to this ridge that helped to support the heavy jaw."}
{"id": "78239", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78239", "title": "Australopithecus", "text": "Australopithecus is a genus of extinct hominids closely related to humans.\nThe first \"Australopithecus\" described was the Taung Child, discovered by Raymond Dart, and described in 1925.\nTheir remains are mostly found in East Africa, and the first fossil is from 3.9 million years ago (mya). The split from other apes would have taken place earlier, perhaps about 5 mya.\nIt is widely believed that the group of which they are part gave rise to the genus \"Homo\", and hence to human beings.\nThe genus \"Australopithecus\" originally included two rather different forms. One form was lightweight: the gracile australopithecines. The other form was bulkier, the robust australopithecines.\nIt is still under discussion whether they should be put in separate genera. Here we treat the gracile forms; the robust forms are described elsewhere as \"Paranthropus\".\nGracile australopithecines shared several traits with modern apes and humans. They were widespread throughout Eastern and Northern Africa 3.9 to 3 million years ago.\nMorphology.\nSkull.\nBrain size.\nThe brains of most species of \"Australopithecus\" were roughly 35% of the size of that of a modern human brain. This is not much more than the brain of a chimpanzee. Brain size in hominins does not increase significantly until the arrival of the genus \"Homo\".\nOther features.\nThe Taung specimen had short canine teeth, and the position of the foramen magnum was evidence of bipedal locomotion.\nSkeleton.\nMost species of \"Australopithecus\" were diminutive and gracile, usually standing between 1.2 and 1.4 m tall (approx. 4 to 4.5 feet). There is a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism. Modern hominids do not show sexual dimorphism to the same degree \u2014 particularly, modern humans display a low degree of sexual dimorphism, with males being only 15% larger (taller, heavier) than females, on average.\nIn \"Australopithecus\", however, males can be up to 50% larger than females, though usually less pronounced than this.\nSummary.\nThe skeleton, the fossil footprints found at Laetoli, Tanzania, the canine teeth and the foramen magnum all show that these apes had achieved bipedalism.\nEvolution.\n\"Australopithecus africanus\" used to be regarded as ancestral to the genus \"Homo\" (in particular \"Homo erectus\").\nHowever, fossils assigned to the genus \"Homo\" have been found that are older than \"A. africanus\". Thus, the genus \"Homo\" either split off from the genus \"Australopithecus\" at an earlier date (the latest common ancestor being \"A. afarensis\" or an even earlier form, possibly \"Kenyanthropus platyops\"), or both developed from a common ancestor independently.\nAccording to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, both human (\"Ardipithecus\", \"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo\") and chimpanzee (\"Pan troglodytes\" and \"Pan paniscus\") lineages diverged from a common ancestor about 5 to 6 million years ago, if we assume a constant rate of evolution.\nHowever, hominins discovered more recently are somewhat older than the molecular clock would suggest. \"Sahelanthropus tchadensis\", commonly called \"Toumai\" is about 7 million years old and \"Orrorin tugenensis\" lived at least 6 million years ago. Since little is known of them, they remain controversial because the molecular clock in humans has determined that humans and chimpanzees had an evolutionary split at least a million years later.\nOne theory suggests that the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged somewhat at first, then some populations interbred around one million years after diverging. More likely, the assumptions behind molecular clocks do not hold exactly. The key assumption behind the technique is that, in the long run, changes in molecular structure happen at a steady rate.\nResearchers such as Ayala have challenged this assumption."}

{"id": "78279", "revid": "941292", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78279", "title": "Poverty in India", "text": "Poverty in India is an important issue. India has some of the poorest people in the world.\nThe Government of India says that the poverty line for rural areas is \u20b9 816 per month and \u20b9 1000 per month in urban areas. This means that many people do not have enough money. India's proposed but not yet adopted official poverty line is \u20b9972 (US$14) a month in rural areas or \u20b91,407 (US$21) a month in cities.\nIn India, the average calorie requirement of an average man is 2400 calories per day in Rural area and 2100 calories per day in Urban area.\nIn 2012, the latest report by the Planning Commission of India (Tendulkar Committee) reported that 26% of all people in India fall below the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day. Over the last decade, poverty has been witnessed a consistent decline with the levels dropping from 37.2% in 2004-05 to 29.8% in 2009-10. The number of poor people is now estimated at 250 million.\nAnalysis.\nIn 1947 the average income in India was similar to South Korea. South Korea became a developed country by the 2000s, but India did not.\nFor the first 40 years, India followed the Soviet-style economic planning, nationalization programs and government ownership of industry. Its economic growth averaged about 3.5%, while Asian economies such as South Korea grew on average more than twice that rate annually. Adjusted for population growth in India, its income per head grew at 1.49% annually, while incomes of South Koreans - rich and poor - rose rapidly.\nIndia's Soviet-style economy included the \"Licence Raj\": the elaborate licences, regulations and red tape needed to set up and run a business in India between 1947 and 1990. The License Raj was a result of India's decision to have a planned economy, where all aspects of the economy are controlled by the state. Licences were only given to a select few. Corruption flourished under this system. Under this system, the country created few jobs and little wealth. Widespread poverty remained."}

He was the brother of physician and philosopher Ludwig B\u00fcchner. Many people think that he might have become as important as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller if he had lived longer.\nHe was the son of a doctor and born in Goddelau near Darmstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt. B\u00fcchner went to a secondary school that focused on Latin, Greek and on modern languages (including French, Italian and English). But he was mainly interested in science and when he went to university he studied medicine in Strasbourg.\nIn 1828 he became interested in politics and joined a group which later on probably became the Gie\u00dfen and Darmstadt section of the \"Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Menschenrechte\" (Society for Human Rights). In Strasbourg, he studied not only medicine but French literature and political thought as well.\nWhile B\u00fcchner continued his studies in Gie\u00dfen he started a secret society which wanted revolutionary change. With the help of the Protestant theologian Friedrich Ludwig Weidig he published the leaflet \"Der Hessische Landbote\", a revolutionary text that criticized social problems in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The authorities charged them with treason and issued a warrant of apprehension. While Weidig was arrested, tortured and died imprisoned in Darmstadt, B\u00fcchner fled across the border to Strasbourg where he wrote most of his literary work and translated two plays by Victor Hugo, \"Lucr\u00e8ce Borgia\" and \"Marie Tudor\". Two years later, his dissertation, \"M\u00e9moire sur le Syst\u00e8me Nerveux du Barbeaux (Cyprinus barbus L.)\" was published in Paris and Strasbourg. The ideas of Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf and Claude Henri de Saint-Simon had an important influence on his work. In October 1836 he got a job at the University of Z\u00fcrich as a lecturer in anatomy and went back to Z\u00fcrich where he spent his final months writing and teaching until he died of typhus at the age of twenty-three.\nIn 1835, his first play, \"Dantons Tod\" (Danton's Death), about the French revolution, was published, followed by \"Lenz\". It is a novella based on the life of the Sturm und Drang poet Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz. In 1836 his second play, \"Leonce and Lena\" he describes the nobility. His unfinished and most famous play, \"Woyzeck\", was the first literary work in German whose main characters were members of the working class. Published after B\u00fcchner's death, it became the basis for Alban Berg's opera \"Wozzeck\" which was first performed in 1925.\nBy the 1870s, B\u00fcchner was nearly forgotten in Germany when Karl Emil Franzos edited his works; these later became a major influence on naturalism and expressionism. Arnold Zweig described \"Lenz\", B\u00fcchner's only work of prose, as the \"beginning of modern European prose\".\nTranslations.\nThere are many translations of the individual plays."}

This can happen if an artery that feeds blood to the brain gets clogged, or if it tears and leaks.\nA stroke is when there is a lack of blood flow to the brain. There are two types of strokes. One is when there is a blood clot blocking the artery. The other type of stroke is when a blood vessel bursts and there is blood moving around freely in the brain.\nA stroke is the rapid loss of brain function(s) due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. This can happen because of ischemia (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage (thrombosis, arterial embolism), or a haemorrhage (leakage of blood).\nAs a result, the affected area of the brain cannot work properly. Symptoms might include: hemiplegia (an inability to move one or more limbs on one side of the body), aphasia (inability to understand or use language), or an inability to see one side of the visual field.\nA stroke is a medical emergency. It can cause permanent damage. If it is not quickly treated, it may lead to death. It is the third most common cause of death and the most common cause of disability for adults in the United States and Europe.\nStrokes happen on both the left and right side of the brain. When a stroke happens on the left side of someone\u2019s brain, it affects the right side of the body. It can also cause problems with the patient\u2019s speech and language. If a stroke affects the right side of the brain, it affects the left side of the body. It also changes patient\u2019s spatial (relating to space) perceptions. Getting a stroke on the right side of the brain can also cause people to not acknowledge their illness. Patients behave impulsively and neglect the side of their body.\nFactors that increase the risk of a stroke include old age, high blood pressure, a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, atrial fibrillation, migraine with aura, and thrombophilia (a tendency to thrombosis). Of those factors, the most easy to fix are high blood pressure and smoking.\nHow are strokes identified?\nPre-hospital.\nThe Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale was designed to help \"pre-hospital\" medical professionals (like EMTs) identify a possible stroke before the patient gets to the hospital. It tests three basic signs. If any of these signs are not normal, the patient may be having a stroke and should be transported to a hospital as soon as possible.\nAbout 72% of patients who cannot do one of these three tasks normally are having an ischemic stroke. More than 85% of patients who cannot do all three tasks are having an acute stroke.\n\"Spot a stroke\".\nThe 'spot a stroke' campaign, created by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association, teaches everyday people how to recognize a stroke. It teaches the basic tests from the Cincinnati Stroke Scale, using the acronym FAST:\nIn the hospital.\nOnce the patient is in the hospital, doctors can find out for sure whether they are having a stroke by looking at their brain with special scanning machines, like an MRI or a CT scanner.\nPrevention.\nStrokes can kill. To prevent a stroke, doctors advise people to:"}

The Wheel originally belonged to the Roman goddess Fortuna, whose name seems to derive from \"Vortumna\", \"she who revolves the year\".

Images that are difficult to make as a vector, like photographs, are often made in the form of a raster image.\nMany printers today use computer languages like Postscript or PCL. These languages are based on vectorized images, most of the time. To be printed, these images need to be translated into raster graphics first. This is done by a part called a Raster Image Processor.

Today, he is known as the conqueror of the Inca Empire. He also founded Lima, La Ciudad de los Reyes, capital of Peru. Pizarro was born in Trujillo, Extremadura, Spain.\nFamily.\nHe was an illegitimate son of Gonzalo Pizarro Rodr\u00edguez de Aguilar (senior) who as colonel of infantry served in the Italian campaigns under Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, and in Navarre, with some distinction. His mother was Francisca Gonz\u00e1lez Mateos, a woman of slender means from Trujillo. Through his father, Francisco was second cousin to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, the famed conquistador of Mexico.\nConquests.\nIn 1502, Pizarro traveled to the New World where he joined in several expeditions to see the Pacific Ocean. In 1513 Pizarro joined the expedition of Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa across the Isthmus of Panama to become one of the first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean. In 1524, after hearing stories about the exploration of Peru, he joined Diego de Almagro and Hernando de Soto. Together, they agreed to travel to Peru and look for gold. The expedition was a disaster, but Pizarro made connections with the Inca people.\nIn 1528 he returned to Spain, where the king allowed him to conquer the new land for Spain. Pizarro himself was to be named governor of Peru. In 1531 he landed in Peru again, leading fewer than 300 soldiers. The country was devastated by a recent civil war between Atahualpa and Huascar, the sons of the dead emperor. In November 1532, Pizarro met Atahualpa in the city of Cajamarca and managed to capture him, even though the Inca was protected by thousands of soldiers. The weapons of the Spaniards proved superior. In 1533, after paying a huge ransom for his release, Atahualpa requested to be let free but Pizarro killed him anyway. He then continued south into Peru and captured the capital of Cuzco.\nIn 1535, Pizarro founded a new capital named La Ciudad de los Reyes, today known as Lima. However, some Spaniards had not been part of the capture of the Inca and therefore had not been paid any gold. Led by Almagro, the \"Almagristas\", Almagro's men, marched south into present-day Chile to find new riches, while Pizarro stayed in Peru. The Inca were treated very poorly and their riches stolen by the Spaniards, who built huge estates or brought gold back to Spain.\nPizarro became the richest and most powerful of them all. \nIn 1536, the Inca tried to overthrow him in a rebellion, but failed since Pizarro managed to subdue the Incas after a year of fights.\nHowever, the Spaniards had became so weakened that when Almagro returned, he took power and expelled Pizarro to the north. Pizarro returned with an army in 1538 and defeated Almagro. Almagro was executed in the plaza of Cuzco and Pizarro was again sole ruler.\nHowever, Almagro had a son who swore revenge, and in 1541, Pizarro was killed in his palace in Lima by a number of men following Diego Almagro the younger. He was himself caught and executed the following year, so was the last brother of Pizarro struggling for power in Peru, in 1548. Then the Spanish king took personal control over the country by a personal envoy, the \"Viceroy\"."}

The game slowly moved to other countries like France, Great Britain, and other parts of Europe. Bingo originates from the Italian lottery, Il Gioco del Lotto d'Italia. In Paris the game was known as Le Lotto, played by the rich part of French society. Since then the game become popular all over the world and today Charitable Bingo in US is worth $3 Billion.\nIn the United Kingdom, the game is played by marking a card. The card has 27 squares in 3 rows of 9. 15 squares have a numbers between 1 and 90. 5 numbers on each row. The winner is the first player to mark the 5 numbers in one line or all fifteen numbers on the card.\nBingo cards are normally printed in strips of six. A strip of six cards has every number between 1 and 90. Many people buy only 4 cards, so that the other two cards were usually wasted. Edward Thompson and Company, the largest printer of bingo tickets in the UK found a way to print strips of 12 so that there would be less waste, and so that any 6 tickets had all of the numbers 1 to 90.\nIn the UK, all money used to buy the bingo ticket must be given back in prize money. The owner of a bingo club is allowed to charge an entrance fee and also a \"participation fee\" (a fee to be allowed to take part in the bingo game).\nIn the United States, the game is played by a group of people. All of the group has cards and tokens. When a number is called that you have on your card, you place a token on that spot. The first person to make a line of 5 tokens up or down, across, or diagonally wins the game. This game is played for prizes usually."}

The Australian Labor party elected him the Leader of the Opposition in December 2006. After 11 years of the Liberal Party being in power, the Labor Party won the 2007 federal election. During the election Rudd talked a lot about work agreements (industrial relations laws) and global warming. As prime minister he signed the Kyoto Protocol and \"apologised\" to Aboriginal Australians for bad things done by the government long ago. He spoke about human rights in China in the Chinese language to Chinese students. Australia and China were doing lots of trade, but the Chinese government did not like this talk. He also supported the Afghanistan war and took Australian troops out of the Iraq conflict.\nRudd was Prime Minister at the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis. His government, with Wayne Swan as treasurer, spent a lot of money to try and keep the economy going. Australia did not have a recession, but management of this government spending started problems for Rudd. His government was seen as being unable to cope with and this started to affect Rudd's popularity.\nRudd planned a new tax on the huge profits being made mining companies in Australia. These companies and their leaders started a huge advertising campaign against the Labor government. He also decided to delay his election promises to do something about Global Warming.

Gillard promised that Rudd would be made Foreign Minister if they won the 2010 election.\nAfter the 2010 Election, Gillard chose Rudd to be Foreign Minister. In February 2012, Rudd decided that he should again be leader of the Labor Party. He said he could not work with Gillard because she did not trust him. He resigned as Foreign Minister, and said he would challenge Gillard for the leadership. The Labor Party held a meeting on 27 February 2012 and held a new vote for the leader's position. Rudd only received 31 votes while Gillard got 71 votes. Rudd returned to the backbench, and not have any positions of responsibility in the government until on 26 June 2013, Gillard announced another caucus ballot on the leadership. Rudd won it so he became the Leader of the Labor Party for a second time. On 27 June 2013, Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister. Rudd is the first former Prime Minister to return to the office since Robert Menzies in 1949 and the second Labor Prime Minister to do so.\nOn 31 May 2012 Rudd became a grandfather when his daughter Jessica gave birth to a baby girl.\nOn 7 September 2013, Labor lost the 2013 election to the Coalition led by Tony Abbott.\nOn 13 November 2013, Rudd announced that he would be retiring from politics at end of week.

Competitions are held between teams from both traditions, often with one version being played in the morning and the other being played in the afternoon.\nGame-play centers around innings where teams act at turns being batters and fielders. A maximum of nine players are allowed to play in fielding positions at one time. Points (\"rounders\") are scored by the batting team by completing a circuit around the field through four bases/posts without being put 'out' - for example, by a ball they batted being 'caught-out' or touching a tagged base/post.\nThe earliest nationally formalised rules of play were devised by the GAA in Ireland in 1884. \nAlthough it is generally considered a school game, rounders is played at international level as well. Currently, teams from Canada, England, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales compete against each other. \nSome theories on the origin of baseball claim that baseball is based on rounders.

They have somewhat flattened bodies and long antennae. There are about 900 species of crickets. They tend to be nocturnal and are often confused with grasshoppers because they have a similar body structure including jumping hind legs.\nCricket chirping.\nCrickets are known for their chirp (which only male crickets can do; male wings have ridges or \"teeth\" that act like a \"comb and file\" instrument). The left forewing has a thick rib (a modified vein) which bears 50 to 300 \"teeth\". The chirp is made by raising their left forewing to a 45 degree angle and rubbing it against the upper hind edge of the right forewing, which has a thick scraper (Berenbaum 1995). This sound producing action is called \"stridulation\" and the song is species-specific. There are two types of cricket songs: a calling song and a courting song. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud.\nJurassic chirp reconstructed.\nNight-time in the Jurassic included the sound of chirping bush crickets. This is according to scientists who have reconstructed the song of a cricket that chirped 165 million years ago. \"A remarkably complete fossil of the prehistoric insect enabled the team to see the structures in its wings that rubbed together to make the sound\"."}

The two main Gaelic games are Gaelic football and hurling. Both are organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).

This decline was stopped by the GAA and the Irish national Gaelic Revival. Today they are the most popular games in Ireland.\nGaelic football.\nGaelic football is the most popular of the gaelic games and is played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The object is to score by driving the ball through the goals. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. It combines the skills of soccer and basketball in a fast-paced, high-scoring contact sport.\nA slightly different rule set is used for women's Gaelic football (officially called \"ladies' Gaelic football\"). The women's game also uses 15-player teams and H-shaped goals, but allows less physical contact.\nHurling.\nHurling is a stick-and-ball game played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at each end. The primary object is to score by driving the ball through the goals. The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. It is over three thousand years old, and is said to be the world's fastest field game, combining skills from lacrosse, field hockey, and baseball in a hard-hitting, highly skilled game.\nCamogie.\nCamogie is a game almost identical to hurling, but played only by women. Like hurling, it is a stick-and-ball game played by teams of 15, with the pitch and goals the same as those in hurling. Other rules are almost the same between the two sports, but camogie does not allow as much physical contact.\nRounders.\nRounders is a bat and ball game which is played in Ireland; a similar version is played in England. Rounders is the least popular of the GAA gaelic games and is organised by a sub division of the GAA known as the Rounders Council of Ireland. It is similar to baseball.\nGaelic handball.\nGaelic handball is a game where two players use their hands to return a ball against a wall. The game is similar to American handball; Gaelic handballers play against their US counterparts.\nOther Gaelic Games.\nOther Gaelic Games such as gaelic athletics have nearly or completely died out. Pastimes such as Road bowling, a sport played in Ireland for a long time, could be considered Gaelic games."}

Every team has 4 players and the team which wins 11 games is final winner of the match. Professional players dispute their matches in sferisterio 90 metres long and 18 metres large with lateral wall. Professional Italian pallapugno league is top level of competitions: in 2008 10 teams competed.\nThis sport is played in various nations and they dispute a world championship.\nPallapugno leggera.\n\"Pallapugno leggera\" is played in courtfield which has same size of volleyball's courtfield without net (device). Each team has 4 players with 2 reserve players. A match consisted of one set or three sets.\nPantalera.\n\"Pantalera\" or \"pallapugno alla pantalera\" is generally played on the urban streets. First action of every match consisted of shot pushing up the ball for rebound on a roof called pantalera in Piedmontese language. Other rules are the same of pallapugno.\nPallonetto.\n\"Pallonetto\" or \"pallonetto ligure al lungo\" is generally played on the urban streets with tennis balls without covering felt. Playing field is long between 60 and 90 metres and it's large 18 metres with or without lateral wall. Players push the ball using one bandaged hand."}

In Italian they also call \"pallacanestro\" for basketball, \"pallavolo\" for volleyball, \"pallamano\" for handball and \"pallanuoto\" for water polo.\nGames.\nPalla eh!\n\"Palla eh!\" is an old Tuscan ball game from Maremma towns between Siena and Grosseto. It has this name because players call out \"eh!\" before serving.\nSmall hand-made balls contain a lead pellet wrapped in rubber and wool with a leather cover. The game is played by facing teams who strike, not catch, the ball with either a bare or gloved hand: every team include 3, 4 or 5 athletes. Courts are marked out with painted lines on town streets, but there is no net, and players can move between sides. Adjacent buildings, objects, and sometimes spectators, are considered \"in play.\" Play does stop for oncoming automobiles. Similar to real tennis, a second bounce can result in a \"chase\" rather than an outright point, marked in chalk where the ball stops rolling. In one version of palla, scoring is identical to that of tennis: 15-30-40-game.\nPalla 21.\nIn a variant called \"palla 21\" scoring is 7-14-21 or game. In this form they use a rubber or plastic ball of 35-40 grams. Firstly a palla 21 tournament was played in Chicago during 2007 with Italian national team.\nPalla elastica.\n\"Palla elastica\" is a team game: every team include 5 athletes who catch a rubber ball, similar to tennis ball, with either a bare hand. The team which wins 11 games is final winner of the match: each game consists of 4 points. Registered players of official championships dispute their matches in a kind of stadium, 75 metres long with lateral wall, named \"sferisterio\" or \"sferodromo\" in Italian language.\nPallamuro.\n\"Pallamuro\" is Italian name of American handball.\nPalla prigioniera.\n\"Palla prigioniera\" is Italian name of prisoner ball.\nPallacorda.\n\"Pallacorda\" or \"palla della corda\" is the Italian name of ancient form of real tennis where a cord of rope was strung across the street and players used hands, racket or tamburello alias \"tambourine\" in English language. Pisa, Prato, Rome, Siena, and various Tuscan towns still have streets named \"via Pallacorda\" or \"via Della Corda\".\nPallamaglio.\n\"Pallamaglio\" is an other ancient game called pall mall in English language and his modern form named skittles is played in England, Germany, Austria and Switzerland currently.\nPallina.\n\"Pallina\" means \"small ball\" and it is a team game: every team include 4, 5 or 6 athletes who catch a rubber ball, of almost 50 grams, with either a bare hand."}

{"id": "78437", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78437", "title": "Storm history of Hurricane Katrina", "text": "The storm history of Hurricane Katrina started on August 23, 2005. Hurricane Katrina was a highly destructive Category 5 hurricane which formed as Tropical Depression Twelve near the Bahamas. The next day, the tropical depression strengthened to a tropical storm, and was named \"Katrina\". Katrina continued on to make landfall on the southern part of the U.S. state of Florida as a Category 1 hurricane.\nWhile passing across Florida, Katrina weakened to a tropical storm. However, the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico allowed it to rapidly intensify to the sixth strongest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. Afterwards, Katrina made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, and once more near the Mississippi/Louisiana border. Katrina did not stop going northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the Great Lakes, where it was absorbed by a cold front.\nFormation.\nTropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern Bahamas at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) on August 23, 2005, some of the tropical depression was from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten, which had dissipated from the effects of a nearby upper tropospheric trough. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic shows that the old name/number is kept when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, much more advanced system, which was then named as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the upper troposphere weakened, causing the wind shear in the area to decrease, also allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later re-analysis, it was found that the low-level circulation of TD Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the second tropical wave mentioned before. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.\nFirst landfall.\nAs the atmospheric conditions surrounding Tropical Depression Twelve were good for tropical development, the system began to strengthen, was upgraded to Tropical Storm status and given the name \"Katrina\" on the morning of August 24. A burst of convection allowed Katrina to become the fifth hurricane of the 2005 season on August 25, only two hours before it made landfall around 6:30 p.m. EST (2230 UTC) between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida.\nKatrina struck the peninsula at a high speed with 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) winds, and had a well-defined eye on Doppler radar, which managed to stay undisturbed throughout its passage over Florida. The storm weakened over land on August 26 to a tropical storm, but regained its strength as a hurricane at 2:00 a.m. EDT (0600 UTC), about one hour after making landfall in Florida. Parts of the Florida Keys experienced tropical storm force winds throughout August 26, with the Dry Tortugas briefly experiencing hurricane-force winds.\nGulf of Mexico.\nAt first, the National Hurricane Center forecasts predicted that Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, eventually to make its second landfall on the Florida Panhandle about three to four days later. Katrina, however, continued a westerly and west-southwesterly track, which eventually made the forecasts change their predictions, and forecast Katrina to move westward into New Orleans.\nRight after the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, the low wind shear, good upper-level outflow, and the warm sea surface temperatures of the Gulf Loop Current caused Katrina to intensify rapidly. On August 27, the storm was upgraded to Category 3 strength, becoming the third major hurricane of the season. An eyewall replacement cycle inhibited strengthening of its maximum winds for about 18 hours, but nearly doubled the size of the storm as a result. The storm then began a second period of rapid intensification starting at 7:00 p.m. CDT on August 27, and by 12:40 a.m. CDT on August 28, Katrina was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h). It became a Category 5 storm by 7:00 a.m. CDT, twelve hours after the beginning of the second round of rapid intensification, and reached its peak intensity at 1:00 p.m. CDT with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h), gusts of 215\u00a0mph (344\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 902\u00a0mbar (26.64\u00a0inHg). The minimum pressure made Katrina, at the time, the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (Hurricanes Rita and Wilma would later beat Katrina's record that same year). As the hurricane came closer New Orleans, the Weather Forecast Office in Slidell, Louisiana gave out two strongly-worded warnings of the storm's danger.\nBy the afternoon of August 28, the storm was large enough that some areas of the Gulf Coast were already experiencing tropical storm-force winds. The center of Katrina was about 180\u00a0statute miles (290\u00a0km) from the mouth of the Mississippi River, but tropical storm-force winds extended 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) from the center of the storm, and hurricane-force winds extended about 105\u00a0miles (170\u00a0km) away.\nOvernight on August 29, and into the morning of the next day, Katrina quickly weakened (in terms of maximum sustained winds) as it began to enter another eyewall replacement cycle. The inner eyewall disappered before an outer eyewall had fully formed, which was one of the reasons of its rapid weakening. In 18\u00a0hours, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds decreased from 170\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h) to 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). However, storm surges remained high at landfall because large waves greater than 30\u00a0feet (9.1\u00a0m) in height were generated beforehand (with a buoy recording a 55\u00a0ft/16.7\u00a0m wave at sea), when Katrina was at Categories 4 and 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The waves then combined with the storm surge of the large Category 3 hurricane.\nSecond and third landfalls.\nKatrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. Because Katrina had just weakened from Category 4 strength, and also because of the shape of the coastline, Category 4-force winds are believed to have existed on land while the eye was over water. At landfall, hurricane-force winds were recorded 120\u00a0miles (190\u00a0km) from the center, the storm's central pressure was 920\u00a0mbar (27.17\u00a0inHg), and its forward speed was 15\u00a0mph (10\u00a0km/h). As it made its way up the eastern Louisiana coastline, most communities in Plaquemines, St. Bernard Parish, and Slidell in St. Tammany Parish were severely damaged by storm surge and the strong winds of the eyewall, which also swipped over eastern New Orleans, creating $1 billion worth of damage to the city from intense flooding and wind damage.\nOriginal estimates recorded that Katrina had made this landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, with 135\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) winds; however, as mentioned above, the storm weakened just before landfall to Category 3 intensity. The reasons for this weakening are not completely understood yet; while the eye-wall replacement cycle played a part, slightly increasing shear, dropping sea surface temperatures, dry air on the western semicircle of the storm and interaction with the continental landmass also may have played a role in weakening the cyclone. This follows the trend of previous strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico: all cyclones with minimum central pressures of 973\u00a0mbar (28.73\u00a0inHg) or less have weakened over the 12\u00a0hours before making landfall in the Gulf Coast of the United States.\nA few hours later, after weakening slightly, Katrina made its third landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border with 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) sustained winds and 928\u00a0mbar (27.37\u00a0inHg) pressure, still at Category 3 intensity. Its minimum pressure at its second landfall was 920\u00a0mbar (27.17\u00a0inHg), making Katrina the third strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States, behind Hurricane Camille's 909\u00a0mbar (26.85\u00a0inHg) reading in 1969, and the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane's 892\u00a0mbar (26.35\u00a0inHg) record.\nBecause the storm was so large, its highly destructive eye-wall winds and the strong northeastern quadrant of the storm pushed record storm surges onshore, smashing all of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, including towns in Mississippi such as Waveland, Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Long Beach, Gulfport, Biloxi, Ocean Springs, Gautier and Pascagoula, and, in Alabama, Bayou La Batre. The surges at its peak were at 28\u00a0feet (8.5\u00a0m) in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and at 13\u00a0feet (4.0\u00a0m) as far away as Mobile, Alabama, which saw its highest storm surge since 1917. Storm surge was particularly high due to the hydrology of the region, the hurricane's extreme size, and the fact that it weakened only shortly before landfall. As Katrina moved inland diagonally over Mississippi, high winds cut a swath of damage that affected almost the entire state.\nDissipation.\nKatrina stayed at hurricane strength in Mississippi, but it soon weakened. It lost hurricane strength more than 150\u00a0miles (240\u00a0km) inland, near Meridian, Mississippi. Katrina was then lowered into a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee and broke in half. One half of the storm continued to race northward, affecting the Central United States, and it was last noticeable in the eastern Great Lakes region. On August 31, it was absorbed by a frontal boundary and became a powerful extratropical low, causing 1.97\u20136.69\u00a0inches (50\u2013170\u00a0mm) of rain in 12 hours. It also caused gale-force wind gusts from 31 to 61\u00a0mph (50 to 98\u00a0km/h) in southeastern Quebec and northern New Brunswick. In the region of Saguenay and C\u00f4te-Nord, rain caused breakdowns and failure in roads. The C\u00f4te-Nord region was isolated from the rest of Quebec for at least 1 week. However, the other half of Katrina broke off in the eastern part of the Appalachians, which caused a major tornado outbreak in the area from central Georgia to central Pennsylvania. The tornadoes were strong, killing two people and creating heavy damage.\nAt 11:00 p.m. EDT on August 31, the center of the remaining storm that was once Katrina was absorbed by another weather system in southeastern Canada."}

It is not a crab at all, but a relative of the arachnids. Its main habitats are coastal areas and river estuaries.\n\"Limulus polyphemus\" is the best-known of the four species.\nDescription.\nOn its dome-shaped carapace, the horseshoe crab has four small eyes. It has two compound eyes at the sides of the carapace, and two simple eyes on the front.\nA horseshoe crab has twelve legs: five pairs of walking legs and a set of tiny pincers. The long, spiky tail is not used as a weapon or for defense; instead, it is just used for steering and flipping the body over if it gets turned upside down.\nDistribution.\nAtlantic.\nAtlantic horseshoe crabs, \"Limulus polyphemus\", can be found all over the eastern coast of North America and Mexico. Buried under mud or sand, they eat small clams, crustaceans, and worms. All over the coast, you will find their shells washed up on shore. Some of these shells are quite big, as the horseshoe crab can grow up to two feet long and a foot wide. Horseshoe crabs go through moults to reach that size.\nThe horseshoe crab population ranges from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula to northern Maine, but they are most commonly found in the mid-Atlantic region between Virginia and New Jersey. Each major estuary along the coast has its own horseshoe crab population, distinguished from one another by size, colour and eye pigment. The females lay about 100,000 eggs.\nOther species.\nThe other three species are also called horseshoe crabs. The Japanese horseshoe crab (\"Tachypleus tridentatus\") is found in the Seto Inland Sea, and is considered an endangered species because of loss of habitat. Two other species occur along the east coast of India: \"Tachypleus gigas\" and \"Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda\". All four are quite similar in form and behavior.\nEaten as food.\nHorseshoe crabs may be threatened by Asian overconsumption.\nImmune system.\nThe horseshoe crab has an effective immune system. Its brackish maritime environment is a perfect home for bacteria. \nThe blood of horseshoe crabs contains an enzyme that causes very rapid clotting in response to the presence of infectious bacteria. This response is used by medical and pharmaceutical companies to detect those kinds of bacteria in products, before the products are sold.\nOrigin.\nHorseshoe crabs are relatives of the Eurypterids (sea scorpions), whose first fossils appeared at the same time. They are quite ancient. They were definitely present in the early Ordovician, 450 million years ago, in a Burgess Shale-type environment. Their body shape has not changed much since then, though fossils in this group are scarce. The Atlantic horseshoe crab itself has no fossil record at all, and the genus \"Limulus\" goes back only some 20 million years, not 200 million.\nThe order they belong to, the Xiphosura, are basal to a clade of the Eurypterida and the Arachnida. It is estimated that the Xiphosura diverged from the Arachnida 480 million years ago.\nEvolution.\nBecause they are famous as so-called \"living fossils\", the evolutionary record and the genetics of the horsehoe crabs have been studied with interest."}

The adjective is 'decadent'. It has nothing to do with the word decade (10 years). \nWhere the word came from.\n\u201cDecadence\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201cde\u201d (from) and \u201ccadere\u201d (to fall). Thus it means \"to fall from a higher state of being\".\nDecadence and society.\nDecadence is usually a state in a society which used to be good but has become bad. Many people have started to behave in a way that others think is shocking and society does not function as well as it did before. Of course, not everyone will agree what is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, but some societies, such as Sodom and Gomorrah, are thought to have been decadent.\nDecadence and the arts.\nThe end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often called the \"fin de si\u00e8cle\" (end of century). It is an example of a supposed decadent society in literature and art. \nIn France there were several writers who were happy to be called \u201cdecadent\u201d. They included Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. In France, the symbolist artists such as Gustave Moreau regarded themselves as \"decadent\". In England decadent artists included the author Oscar Wilde and visual artists such as Aubrey Beardsley. The \"decadents\" advocated living a \"decadent lifestyle\", which means a lifestyle based on seeking the maximum possible amount of aesthetic pleasure. \nIn the early 1970s, glam rock musicians such as David Bowie called themselves \"decadent\". David Bowie's 1973 album \"Diamond Dogs\" is about the theme of decadence. Glam rock musicians and fans of glam rock music signaled that they were decadent by wearing platform shoes. The popular 1976 film \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" was a humorous depiction of \"decadence\". \nPeople of the goth subculture, which began in the early 1980s among fans of the band Bauhaus, generally regard themselves as being \"decadent\". One way they may symbolize themselves as being decadent is by wearing fishnet stockings. \nColors that symbolize decadence.\nThe color lavender is usually used to symbolize decadence. Both of the books in the \"further reading\" list below are colored different tones of lavender. In the 1890s, the color mauve was used to symbolize decadence--the 1890s were called the \"mauve decade\". "}

There are two types: groundwork and feet work. Ground work is when both players are on the ground. Usually the attacker would be on top and the uke (defender) would be on the bottom. In feet work both players would move along the mat in a variety of moves. Every once in a while a player will throw his/her opponent on the floor. In competitions the players will go full on for each other and once someone has thrown his/hers opponent down they need to hold them down for 20 seconds or the point won't count.

Bacteria and fungi eat the raw material, but they do not eat all of it. They leave a small amount behind. The part they leave behind is named \"humus\". This activity is dynamic and keeps happening. There is always more dead material arriving on top.

Soil is often broken into layers. The top layer is high in organic matter (roting plants and such). Then there is a layer of layer of soil where rain water has removed some metals (called \"leaching\"). Those metals get collected in another, lower layer. Finally, there is a layer made up mostly of broken bits of bedrock. A soil can have all of these layers, or only a few.\nSoils are important because most groundwater, which is used in everything from city water supplies to farming, is found in soil, not bedrock."}

They are deposited over time, and often show layers which can be seen in cliffs. Other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock.\nSediments are usually formed from matter which falls to the bottom of oceans and lakes. The matter includes tiny pieces of other rocks, and dead animals, plants and microorganisms. Also, inorganic chemicals may be precipitated from solution in the water. The three most common sedimentary rocks are limestone, sandstone and shale.\nSedimentary rocks cover 7580% of the Earth's land area, but they make up only 5% of the Earth's crust. The relative abundances of the different types of sedimentary rocks are:\nConsolidation.\nSqueezed and compressed over time, the sediments become 'consolidated' (made solid) into layers of rock. Stratigraphy is the study of those layers\nCementation occurs when dissolved mineral components deposit in the interstices of sediments. It is the sticking together of sediment that forms a rock.\nOtherwise, rocks may have the water squeezed out, yet remain for long periods with their character unchanged. There are many quarries of unconsolidated deposits where sand and gravel are removed for the construction industry. Such quarries may be taking out sand which has lasted as sand since the Jurassic period. But consolidated sand, sandstone, can be a very hard rock.\nConsolidated rocks may be changed some more, by water seeping through, or by heat and extreme pressure.\nTypes of sedimentary rock.\nSediments are formed by three processes:\nThese sedimentary processes \u2013 weathering, transportation, and deposition \u2013 reach three final end products: quartz sand, shale (from clay), and limestone (CaCO3). Most sedimentary rocks are variations on this general pattern.\nChalk, limestone, and dolomite are all basically made from calcium carbonate. This comes from a mixture of minerals and pieces of animals (especially animal shells). They are mostly formed in oceans.\nShales, sandstones, and conglomerates are all clastic rocks. They are made from pieces of other rocks. The pieces may have come from erosion by water, ice or wind.\nCoal is made from ancient plants; oil and natural gas is also organic in origin.\nSome sedimentary rocks are made of just one type of sediment, all about the same size, such as sand. Other sedimentary rocks will have large and small lumps, and pieces of different types of rock. Well-known sedimentary rocks are sandstone and limestone.\nSedimentary rocks may be found anywhere on Earth. When sedimentary rocks are heated and squeezed, they become metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks have a volcanic origin. Over a very long time, rocks get recycled, in two ways. When marine sediments are raised above sea level, they get weathered, and the pieces carried down to the sea. On a much longer time-scale continental plates may collide. Then one plate goes under the other (is subducted), and all its material is recycled, emerging much later."}

It is made of minerals (which are crystalline), or other mineral-like substances. The Earth's outer solid layer, the lithosphere, is made of rock. That means the Earth's crust is made of rock. The different minerals in the rocks make different kinds of rock. \nRock is often covered by soil or water. It is beneath the oceans, lakes, and rivers of the earth, and under the polar icecaps. Petrology is the scientific study of rocks.\nRock classification.\nRocks are classified by their minerals and chemical make-up. The processes that formed them are also noted. Rocks may be igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. Rock types may change in a so-called 'rock cycle'.\nIgneous rocks.\nIgneous rocks are formed when molten magma cools, either above or below the surface. They are divided into two main categories: plutonic rock and volcanic rock. Plutonic or intrusive rocks are made when magma cools and crystallizes slowly within the Earth's crust (example granite). Volcanic or extrusive rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as lava or ejecta (examples pumice and basalt).\nSedimentary rock.\nSedimentary rocks are the most common rocks on Earth. They form at or near the Earth's surface. Sedimentary rock is formed in layers which were laid down one by one on top of another. Some of the layers are thin, some are thick. Layers are made by deposition of sediment, organic matter, and chemical precipitates. Deposition is followed by squeezing of sediment under its own weight, and cementation. This process is called 'consolidation': it turns the sediment into a more or less hard substance.\nThe approximate amounts of different kinds of sedimentary rock are:\nOnly sedimentary rocks have fossils.\nMetamorphic rock.\nMetamorphic rocks are formed by rocks coming under great pressure and high temperatures. These temperatures and pressures are found under mountains and volcanoes, especially when continental plates move together. These conditions change the make-up of the original minerals.\nImpact on human life.\nRocks have had an impact on human life. They have been used by humans for over two million years. The mining of rocks for their metals has been one of the most important things in human advancement. Rocks are mined for building materials of all kinds."}

It is a natural process. \nWeathering occurs in one place with little or no movement, and should not be confused with erosion which is when rocks and minerals are moved to another place by ice, water, wind or gravity.\nMechanical weathering.\nMechanical or physical weathering is when the rocks and minerals are broken down but the Chemical composition remains the same. Mechanical weathering physically breaks up rock. \nWind.\nWind can blow water or small particles such as sand against the rock thus breaking it down.\nThe wind blowing over your skin removes body heat.local winds are the winds that blow over short distances.\nRain.\nRain is another force that works slowly. The force of raindrops on some rocks make them wear down. Rain also can make a chemical change in some rocks, because it is usually slightly acidic. The water mixes with the minerals in the rock to break it down.\nTemperature.\nChanging temperature can make a rock crack. Every day when the sun shines on the rock, its surface is heated. Heat causes the surface to expand (get bigger) a little. The inside of the rock, though, does not heat up as fast as the outside of the rock. The inside of the rock stays cooler. At night, the surface cools down and contracts. The expanding and contracting makes some places on the surface weak, and a crack is made.\nAlso, if water gets into a crack in a rock and the temperature goes below the freezing point, the water will freeze and expand. After some time, the rock may be weak enough to break into pieces.\nIce.\nIce, which can be miles thick, grinds the surface of the rock below it. The particles are carried with the ice, and if a glacier ends up in the sea, so does all the material carried with it.\nLava or magma.\nLava or magma can cause weathering when molten rock touches older rock. It causes the older rock to change form to a different crystal structure.\nChemical weathering.\nChemical weathering is the breaking down of rock which changes the chemical composition.\nCarbon dioxide cycle.\nThe carbon dioxide cycle is the most important for weathering. CO2 is put into the atmosphere mostly by volcanoes, and it is taken out of the atmosphere by photosynthesis, and by one other process. \nWhile it is in the air, CO2 can dissolve in water droplets to form weak carbonic acid.\nWhen rain hits rock it does so with mechanical energy and dilute acid. The acid dissolves many types of minerals and rocks though, of course, very slowly. When a mineral like feldspar is dissolved, it lets sodium ions into the sea; chlorine ions come from other minerals. The sea tastes salty because of the elements which have been dissolved out of rocks."}

A crystal compound often has other compounds on it that make it less useful. To get rid of these extra items, the crystal is placed in a boiling liquid. Soon the crystal dissolves. The boiling solution, or the mix of the liquid and the dissolved crystal, gets colder. The crystal will form again. The unwanted compounds stay in the solvent, or the liquid. Now the crystal is pure and made of only the compound. Each type of compound works best in a certain type of liquid. Sometimes two or more liquids mixed together are needed to dissolve a crystal.\nIn geology, solid-state recrystallization is a metamorphic process that occurs under situations of intense temperature and pressure where grains, atoms or molecules of a rock or mineral are packed closer together, creating a new crystal structure. \nLimestone is a sedimentary rock that undergoes metamorphic recrystallization to form marble, and clays can recrystallize to muscovite mica.\nIn metallurgy, recrystallization is the nucleation and growth of new undeformed grains in a deformed metal.\nFor ice, recrystallization means the growth of larger crystals at the expense of smaller ones. Some biological antifreeze proteins have been shown to inhibit this process, and the effect may be relevant in freezing-tolerant organisms."}

The term is sometimes used for relatively small country houses which belonged to gentry families, as well as to grand stately homes, particularly as a technical term for minor late medieval castles more intended for show than for defence.\nIn general terms, the manor house was the house of a feudal lord of a manor, which he occupied only on occasional visits if he held many manors. Although not built with strong fortifications as castles were, many manor houses were partly fortified: they were enclosed within walls or ditches. Often the farm buildings were within these walls as well. Many manor houses had small gatehouses and watchtowers. \nThe main feature of the manor house was its great hall. By the beginning of the 16th century, manor houses as well as small castles began to acquire the character and amenities of the residences of country gentlemen. This late 16th century transformation produced many of the smaller Renaissance ch\u00e2teaux of France and the many country mansions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean styles in England. \nIn France, the terms \"ch\u00e2teau\" or \"manoir\" are often used to describe a French manor house. \"Maison-forte\" is another French word to describe a strongly fortified manor house. In the western France provinces of Brittany and Normandy, certain large manors enjoyed real means of protection. \nIn modern usage, the term \"manor\" or \"manor house\" is often used, especially outside Europe, to mean simply either a country house or indeed any other house considered to resemble one, without any reference to age or to the historical sense of the term."}

Before this time most larger houses were fortified, because their owners were feudal lords or overlords of their manor. The Tudor period of stability in the country saw the first of the large unfortified country houses.\nWith the rise of modern industry and urbanization, when people left the country to go to the big cities the popularity of country houses declined as there were less people in the country. After 1945 it became very difficult to pay for the huge staff that was required to maintain these houses."}

Both pitch and loudness are controlled here. It has a small slit through which air passes and makes the vocal cords vibrate. The vibrating vocal cords make the air vibrate. This sound changes as it travels through the vocal tract. It becomes a different sound based on the position of the tongue, lips, mouth, and pharynx.\nWhen swallowing, the backward motion of the tongue forces part of the larynx called the epiglottis to cover up the opening to the larynx, also called the laryngeal opening. This is to stop the food swallowed from entering the lungs. The larynx is also pulled upwards to help with this process. If the larynx is irritated by something that is swallowed, a strong cough reflex is used to protect the lungs.\nDisorders of the larynx.\nThere are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly. Some symptoms are hoarseness, loss of voice, pain in the throat or ears, and breathing difficulties. Larynx transplant is not done very often.

It had been known as MS \"Lindblad Explorer (\u20131985) and MS \"Society Explorer\" (\u20131992). It was registered in Liberia. It was designed for sailing in cold areas, such as around Antarctica. The MS \"Explorer\" was originally ordered by the Swedish explorer Lars-Eric Lindblad. The ship was sold several times. Its last owner was the Toronto-based travel company G.A.P Adventures. It had bought the \"Explorer\" in 2004.\nBesides being the first cruise ship ever built specifically to ply the frigid waters of the Antarctic Ocean, the \"Explorer\" became the first ever to sink there when it struck an unidentified submerged object, possibly ice, on November 23, 2007, which caused a 10-by-4\u00a0inch (25 \u00d7 10\u00a0cm) gash in the hull. Everyone escaped from \"Explorer\" in the early hours of November 23, 2007, after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, which is usually stormy, but was calm at the time. The \"Explorer\" was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position: 62 degrees 24 minute South and 57 degrees 16 minutes west, between South Shetlands and Grahams Land, in the Bransfield Strait, where the depth is roughly 2,000 feet (600\u00a0m).\nHistory.\nCommissioned by Lars-Eric Lindblad, the Swedish-American pioneer of exotic expedition tours, the \"Explorer\" was built in 1969 at Nystads Varv shipyard in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The ship was built to stay afloat with two of its compartments filled with water, and its ice class on the HELCOM scale was IC.\nThe vessel was originally named the \"Lindblad Explorer\" in honor of Lars-Eric Lindblad. On February 11, 1972 the \"Explorer\" ran aground (into the ground) near La Plaza Point, Antarctica; its passengers, Lars-Eric Lindblad among them, were rescued by the Chilean Navy. It was towed to Buenos Aires, Argentina and then to Kristiansand, Norway for repairs.\nIn 1998 \"Explorer\" was the first ship to sail around the James Ross Island;.\nThe \"Explorer\" was depicted on at least two postage stamps issued by South Georgia.\nSinking.\nThe ship left Ushuaia, Argentina on November 11, 2007, on a 19-day cruise intended to trace the route of 20th century explorer Ernest Shackleton through the Drake Passage (an area typically stormy with rough seas). After visiting the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island the \"Explorer\" hit an unidentified submerged object in the Bransfield Strait close to King George Island in the Antarctic Ocean, near the South Shetland Islands, on November 23, 2007. The object struck by the \"Explorer\" caused a 10-by-4\u00a0inch (25 \u00d7 10\u00a0cm) hole to the ship's port side (left side) which allowed sea water to enter the ship.\nA passenger reported sea water in the cabin at about 03:00 UTC. Although some reports indicate there had been no noticeable impact, or at least nothing more than the normal crunching of ice experienced when sailing through icy waters, other reports say that there was a loud bang. Some reports also indicate that the ship drifted into an iceberg on the \"Explorer's\" starboard side while the crew was assessing damage caused by the original impact to the port side of the ship.\nA mayday call was put out by the ship at 04:24 UTC, and rescue operations were quickly coordinated by the Prefectura Naval (Coast Guard Corps) of the Argentine Republic, and the Chilean Navy Center for Search and Rescue. Chile dispatched the icebreaker \"Almirante Viel\", and nearby commercial ships including the MN \"Ushuaia\", the \"National Geographic Endeavor\", and the Norwegian Coastal Express ship MS \"Nordnorge\" which was operating as a passenger cruise ship at the time. By 07:30 UTC, all 91 passengers, 9 guides and 54 crew, from over 14 countries\n, left the ship and took to the life rafts, where they drifted for three to four hours, until they were picked up by the Norwegian ship MS \"Nordnorge\" which arrived on scene by 10:00 UTC.\n It is believed that the \"Explorer\" sank at about 19:00 UTC. Coincidentally, earlier in 2007, the MS \"Nordnorge\" was involved in another Antarctic rescue when it evacuated 294 passengers from a sister ship, the MS \"Nordkapp\", when the Nordkapp ran aground on Deception Island, a part of these same remote South Shetland Islands archipelago.\nSome of those rescued by the \"Nordnorge\" were taken to the Chilean Eduardo Frei Montalva Station on King George Island. Later they were flown by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft of the Chilean Air Force to Punta Arenas, Chile, in two separate flights on Saturday, November 24, and Sunday, November 25, 2007. Approximately 70 of the survivors were taken to Uruguay\u2019s Artigas Base. The \"Explorer\" sank within 20 hours after striking an unknown submerged object reported to be ice. "}

Deposition happens when the forces which transport sediments are weaker than the forces of particle weight and friction. This causes a resistance to movement, and the particles drop down. \nDeposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived matter or chemical process."}

Plants and animals have these built-in cycles which allow them to flower at the right time, sleep at the right time, etc. \nThese cycles are also called circadian clocks. The word \"circadian\" comes from the Latin \"circa\", \"around\", and \"diem\" or \"dies\", \"day\", meaning \"about a day\". Biological time-keeping rhythms include daily, tidal, weekly, seasonal, and annual rhythms. However, most of these rythms repeat once a day, so they are called circadian from the Latin \"circa\" (about) \"dies\" (a day). \nCircadian clocks are the internal clocks which make sure that the organism is doing the right thing at the right time. With more complex animals there is the matter of sleep, which seems to be universal amongst animals which have a brain.\nCircadian rhythms do some amazing things, especially in the oceanic animals whose eggs are fertilised externally. This means the eggs and sperm have to be released at the same time by both sexes of the same species. Little is known about the physiology of how this coordination is achieved.\nAnimal clocks have three main parts:\nIn 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young \"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\" in fruit flies (\"Drosophila\").\nThe circadian rhythms, also called the \"biological clock\" or the \"body clock\", of humans and other animals, regulate many bodily functions including feeding, sleeping, body temperature and hormone production.\nPlants.\nThe actual machinery in plants, fungi and bacteria are different from those in the animal clock.

It is also a type of anaphrodisiac.\nCastration in veterinary practice.\nCastration is commonly performed on domestic animals not intended for breeding. \nDomestic animals are usually castrated in order to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction; to reduce or prevent other ways of sexual behaviour such as territorial behaviour or aggression (like fighting between groups of uncastrated males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behaviour that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as fence destruction when animals try to get to nearby females of the species.\nMale horses are usually castrated, because stallions are rather aggressive. The same applies to male mules, although they are sterile. Male cattle are castrated to improve docility for use as oxen.\nA specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species:\nCastration in humans.\nThe practice of castration has its roots before recorded human history. Castration was frequently used in certain cultures of Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa and China, for political, religious or social reasons. After battles in some cases, victors castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolise their victory and 'seize' their power. Castrated men \u2014 eunuchs \u2014 were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households: in particular, the harem. Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. Other religions, for example Judaism and Islam, were strongly opposed to the practice. The \"Leviticus Holiness code\", for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from sacrifice.\nIn China, to become a servant of the emperor, men had to be castrated. This would prevent them from having sons or having affairs with royal concubines. Eunuchs in China have been known to usurp power in many eras of Chinese history, most notably in the Later Han, late Tang and late Ming Dynasties. There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events.\nReasons.\nMedical.\nTesticular cancer is generally treated by surgical removal of the cancerous testicle(s) (orchidectomy), often followed by radiation or chemotherapy. Unless both testicles are cancerous, only one is removed.\nAs punishment.\nEdward Gibbon's famous work \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the Normans. Castration has also been used in modern conflicts, as the Janjaweed militiamen currently (as of 2005) attacking citizens of the Darfur region in Sudan, often castrating villagers and leaving them to bleed to death. In some countries, the law suggests castrating sex criminals such as hebephilles.\nFor religious reasons.\nIn Europe, when females were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were sometimes castrated to prevent their voices breaking at puberty and to develop a special high voice. The first documents mentioning castrati are Italian church records from the 1550s."}

The canton is one of the drier parts of Switzerland in its central Rhone valley. It is also one of most well-watered parts, having large amounts of snow and rain up on the highest peaks in Switzerland. It is perhaps best known worldwide for the Matterhorn.\nGeography.\nThe canton of Valais is in the south of Switzerland. To its south is Italy, to the southwest France. To the north the canton there are the Swiss cantons of Vaud and Bern; the cantons of Uri and Ticino lie to its east.\nThe wide, icy Rhone valley dominates the area. There are many side valleys off the main valley. At the head of the Mattertal valley is Zermatt, a pretty tourist village dominated by views of the Matterhorn (4,478 m). Fifty of the mountains are more than 4,000m high, with the highest, Monte Rosa, that reaches to 4,638m (15,217\u00a0ft), and there are many glaciers.\nThe Rh\u00f4ne drains the main valley from east to west up to Martigny, Switzerland, then in a right angle north to its mouth in the Lake Geneva. After the small town of Saint-Maurice, the northern banks of the river belong to the canton of Vaud. The main valley is between the Bernese Alps in the north and the Pennine Alps in the south. Only about half of the total area is considered productive.\nHistory.\nThe Romans called the area \"Vallis Poenina\" (\"Upper Rh\u00f4ne Valley\").\nIn 888, Valais became a part of the kingdom of Jurane Burgundy.\nKing Rudolph III of Burgundy gave the area to the Bishop of Sion in 999, and made him Count of the Valais. The count-bishops had to defend their area against the dukes of Savoy.\nin 1474 was the Battle of Planta, a place near the capitale Sion. The Bishop of Sion and the people of the Sieben Zenden, beat the Duke of Savoy. The Battle of Planta is a part of the Burgundy War. \nAfter this battle, the bisoph conquired the area until Lake Geneva.\nValais did not follow the Protestant Reformation.\nOn March 12, 1529, Valais became an associate member (\"Zugewandter Ort\") of the Swiss Confederation.\nIn 1628 the Valais became a republic, the \"R\u00e9publique des Sept Dizains / Republik der Sieben Zenden\" but the bishop remained in power until Napoleon's troops invaded the Valais and created the \"R\u00e9publique du Valais\" on March 16, 1798 but on May 1, 1798, the Valais became part of the Helvetic Republic and became independent again in 1802 as the \"Rhodanic Republic\".\nIn 1810, the Rhodanic Republic was made a part of France, and was called the Simplon Department.\nValais became independent again in 1813 and on August 4, 1815 decided to join the Swiss confederation as a canton (state).\nIn 1845, the Valais joined the Catholic separatist league (\"Sonderbund\"), but never fought federal troops when other members of the league started fighting in 1847.\nEconomy.\nWine production and tourism are some of the main industries of the canton. The Matterhorn near Zermatt is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the Swiss mountains, as is its sister valley immediately east Saas Fee. Other parts of the mountains of the canton farther west are popular as well, such as the more French speaking resorts near Verbier and the Evolene &amp; Arolla region. The resorts on the north side of the main Rhone river valley are popular, looking out southwards towards the Peninne Alps and still part of the southern slope of the Bernese Alps, such as the family oriented resort of Crans-Montana. The resorts in the Goms region are slightly less known, yet also receive attention during the summer hiking season and the winter ski season.\nApart from tourism, agriculture is still important, particularly cattle breeding in the mountains and dairy farming in the plains. The wine industry of the canton is the largest in Switzerland. There are also a large number orchards in the area, and saffron is also gathered here.\nThe most industrial western region of the canton is called Chablais. The area is very important for the economy. There are a lot of factories, the most important are the subsidiaries of Novartis and Syngenta, in Monthey. In the town of Collombey, there is an oil refinery.\nNear Visp there is a large plant of aluminium manufacturing. Other metal products and chemicals are produced around Visp and Sierre.\nDespite the thriving tourist industry, high level of infrastructure, and the many vineyards, canton Valais is still one of the poorest of the Swiss cantons, and not near the rich banking/financial cantons. A large portion of the canton's land and houses are now owned by foreigners.\nTransport.\nA small airport is at Sion, but the main routes of transport are rail and road. Both networks are large and benefit from tourism. Many of the road passes are well known, such as the Grimsel Pass. The longest land tunnel in the world, the L\u00f6tschberg Base Tunnel, will soon be working, in late 2007 perhaps, connecting by rail the town of Frutigen in canton Bern, with the town of Visp in canton Valais/Wallis. This is to better spread car traffic in the highly scenic Kandertal, and also to provide faster transport through the Bernese Alps from the populous Mittelland in the north to the southern canton of Valais. Cars may be loaded onto the trains as freight.\nDemographics.\nValais is mostly French speaking. The eastern part of the canton Upper Valais, however, speaks Walliser German. The French speaking population makes up a two-thirds of the population.\nThe people of the canton are spread thinly. The largest towns are the capitals Sion (\"Sitten\"), Sierre and Brig.

It has a population of about 15,000 people. Martigny is at the joining of Italy, France and Switzerland, one road linking this town over the Great St. Bernard Pass to Aosta (Italy), and the other one, over the col de la Forclaz to Chamonix (France). In winter, Martigny is appreciated for its nearby ski resorts like Verbier.\nHistory.\nIn the first century BCE, present-day Martigny was an oppidum or vicus of a Celtic tribe, the Veragri. It was then called Octodurus or Octodurum. When Julius Caesar was in Gaul (57-56 BCE), he sent Servius Galba with the twelfth legion and some cavalry into the country of the Nantuates, Veragri, and Seduni. His purpose in sending this force was to open the pass over the Alps, the pass of the Great St. Bernard, by which road the \"mercatores\" had been used to travel at great risk, and with the payment of great tolls. (\"B. G.\" iii. 1.) The people of the Alps allowed the Italian merchants to pass, because if they plundered them the merchants would not come; but they got as much out of them as they could. Galba, after taking many strong places, and receiving the submission of the people, sent off two cohorts into the country of the Nantuates, and with the remaining cohorts determined to winter in Octodurus, which was in a valley with no great extent of level ground near it, confined on all sides by very lofty mountains. There is some level ground at Martigny, and the valley of the Rhone at this part is not very narrow. Caesar says that the town of Octodurus was divided into parts by a river, but he does not mention the river's name. It is the Dranse. Galba gave one part of the town to the Galli to winter in, and assigned the other to his troops. He fortified himself with a ditch and rampart, and thought he was safe. He was, however, suddenly attacked by the Galli before his defences were complete or all his supplies were brought into the camp. Thus began the Battle of Octodurus. The Romans obstinately defended themselves in a six hours' fight; when, seeing that they could no longer keep the enemy out, they made a sortie, which was successful. The Romans estimated the Galli at more than 30,000, and Caesar says that more than a third part were destroyed. The slaughter of the enemy was prodigious, which has been made an objection to Caesar's veracity, or to Galba's, who made his report to the commander. It has also been objected that the valley is not wide enough at Martigny to hold the 30,000 men. There may be error in the number that attacked, and also in the number who died. After this escape Galba prudently withdrew his troops, and marching through the country of the Nantuates reached the land of the Allobroges, where he wintered.\nThe region joined the Roman Empire. In 47, Emperor Claudius founded Forum Claudii Augusti, later renamed Forum Claudii Vallensium to avoid confusion with another city that was dear to him. Octodurus was the principal town of the area until the displacement of the episcopal see to Sion in the 4th century. Pliny (iii. c. 20) says that the Octodurenses received the \"Latinitas\" (\"Latio donati\"). The town appears in the Antonine Itinerary and in the Tabula Peutingeriana. In the \"Notit. Prov.\", the place is called Civitas Vallensium Octodurus. At a later period it was called Forum Claudii Vallensium Octodurensium, as an inscription shows. One authority speaks of the remains of a Roman aqueduct at Martigny. Many coins, and other memorials of the Roman time, have been found about the place.\nThe name \"Octodur\" is manifestly Celtic. The second part of the name is \"Dur\", water. The first part, probably some corrupt form, is not explained. The town sat on the Roman road from Augusta Praetoria (modern Aosta) in Italy.\nPresent situation.\nThe Romans left many ruins. The city is known for the amphitheatre, which was restored in 1978. Cow fights are held in the amphitheatre during early autumn for the \"Comptoir\". The city is also famous for its museum, the Pierre Gianadda Foundation, built on top of Roman ruins.\nThe area has some apricot orchards, and vines on steep slopes."}

It is pretty far southeast of Gstaad, and is pretty close to the border with Italy.\nZermatt has a local population of 5,500 people, but the actual population changes through the seasons as tourists come and go.\nTourism.\nZermatt is a famed ski resort and is a tourist destination. Until the mid-1800s, it was mostly a farming community; its name, as well as that of the Matterhorn itself, derives from the alpine meadows, or \"matten\", in the valley. In the German language, the town is \"Zur Matte\", or \"in the meadow.\"\nThe town was \"discovered\" mid-century by British mountaineers, most notably Edward Whymper, whose conquest of the Matterhorn made the village famous worldwide.\nZermatt is a closed village, which means that non-Swiss nationals are not permitted to buy property within the area. May is the worst time to visit this city, as most of the streets are muddy.\nHiking.\nZermatt is a good place to start many hikes into the surrounding mountains, such as the Haute Route that ultimately leads to Chamonix in France. A complex of cable cars and chair lifts carry skiers in the winter and hikers in the summer; the highest of them leads to the Klein Matterhorn, a small outcropping on the ridge between Breithorn and Matterhorn that offers cool views in all directions. It is possible to cross into Italy via the Cervinia cable car station.\nTransportation.\nAny automobile that uses an engine is not allowed in Zermatt because of concerns for air pollution. Electric vehicles are allowed for local commerces. The Cantonal police allow some people to park in the northern section of this city. Some emergency vehicles (firetrucks, ambulance..) are also allowed to use combustion engines.\nMost people reach Zermatt by train or cable car. Trains also leave for Zermatt from Visp and Brig.\nSkiing.\nZermatt is well known throughout the world for its great skiing, especially Triftji for its moguls. The high altitude results in consistent skiing continuously up until the summer.\nSkiing in Zermatt is split up into four distinct areas; Sunnegga, Gornegrat, Klein Matterhorn and Schwarzsee. There is also a connection to Cervinia and Valtournenche in Italy. \nTrail Map."}

They are all passerines, but unusually they do not have musical voices. \nThere are over 120 species in the family. The word 'crow' is also used to describe birds in the genus \"Corvus\". This genus includes the crows, jackdaws and ravens.\nCrows are found on every continent except for the southern area of South America and Antarctica. Most crows are found in South America, Central America, Europe and Asia. There are only 10 species each in Africa, Australia and North America.\nA group of crows is called a \"murder\" and, indeed, they are distinctly carnivorous..\nDescription.\nMost members of the crow family are black, such as crows, rooks, choughs, ravens and jackdaws. However, not all crows are black. Magpies and treepies can be black and white, or blue and green, or brown. Jays are often blue and white.\nCrows are some of the most intelligent birds in the world. Crows and rooks are good at using tools, for example sticks or twigs. Magpies can see themselves in a mirror and they understand that it is a reflection. Many crows live near to humans in towns and cities. Some crows (such as treepies) live in forests. They are more shy than the crows that live in cities.\nSome crows in North America, Europe and northern Asia migrate. This means they travel to different places in summer or winter. Most crows are resident birds. This means they live in the same place all year round.\nMany crows live in large groups. For example, many rooks nest together in large groups at the top of trees. This is called a rookery. Crows in big groups are often noisy. However, when it is the breeding season (this means when birds nest and have babies), crows can become angry and will scare off other crows.\nCrows eat a variety of food. They will eat fledglings (baby birds) and eggs from nests, small animals (mice and rats), carrion (dead animals), vegetables and garbage. for much of the year, crows and rooks dig into grassland with their strong beaks, and eat various kinds of insect grubs and worms. Because they may attack the nest of other birds, crows may get mobbed by other species. This is when the defending birds group together to chase off the crow. Also, on farms, crows will eat vegetables and seeds. Farmers do not want this to happen so they make a scarecrow. This is an object made of straw and old clothes. It looks like a man and it may scare the crows away.\nCrows make their nests in tall trees. They make the nest from large sticks. They usually lay 3\u20138 eggs. Both parents look after the fledglings.\nMain species.\nThe family includes:"}

The skull's shape is strange, with many technical differences from the opossums.\nPhylogeny and biogeography.\nIt has long been suspected that South American marsupials were ancestral to those of Australia. The two continents were connected via Antarctica in the early Cainozoic era.\nAustralia\u2019s earliest known marsupial is \"Djarthia\", a primitive mouse-like animal that lived about 55 million years ago. \"Djarthia\" had been identified as the earliest known australidelphian, and this research suggested that the Monito del Monte was the last of a clade which included \"Djarthia\".\nIn 2010, analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of marsupials confirmed the placement of the Monito del Monte in Australidelphia.

The mouth of the Russian River is in the northern part of the beach. Goat Rock is in the southern part of the beach. The beach itself was named after the rock. The naming of Goat Rock is unknown, but many sources say some goat herders around the early 20th century used the grassy, flat rock for goats, because few other animals could live there.\nGoat Rock Beach has many visitors. It usually has the most people in the middle of summer. The beach is a popular spot for swimming and surfing. It is home to seagulls, harbor seals, and sea lions, as well as other animals from the Pacific Ocean.\nHistory.\nThe oldest natural history of the area is related to marks made by mammals in an area of rock about one third of a mile south of Goat Rock Beach. In uplifted sea stack formations, there are rubbing marks about two to four meters above the ground surface, too high of a rubbing mark for modern bovids. Mammoths are thought to have traveled here as recently as 40,000 years ago, and are thought to have made these rubbing marks. Mammoth fossils have been found at Bodega Head, which is a few miles south of Goat Rock Beach.\nThe earliest known humans to settle at Goat Rock Beach were the Native American Coast Miwok and Pomo tribes. During the mid-1800s, Mexican ranchers lived in California, and Goat Rock Beach was part of a Mexican land grant called the \"Bodega Rancho\". The Russians are thought to have begun cutting down the forests just north of the beach in the early 19th century.\nGeography.\nThe Russian River, which has its mouth at the north end of Goat Rock Beach, is Sonoma County's biggest watercourse and river. Just north of the Russian River mouth is the small town of Jenner, and the beach, Jenner Beach. Goat Rock is at the south end of the beach. Visitors can walk onto Goat Rock, going on a small \"isthmus\", which is also known as a land bridge. Blind Beach is just south of Goat Rock Beach, with only Goat Rock between the two beaches, and Goat Beach is southwest of it.\nGeology.\nGoat Rock Beach has much marine erosion and erosion from the wind. This causes about one to three feet of land mass lost each year. \"Erosion\" is when water and wind remove the top layer of rock or mud. During big storms, there can be even more erosion. \nThe \"sea stacks\" (eroded parts of rock) along the Goat Rock Beach coast are rocks from the Franciscan Complex, rock formations which were made during earthquakes in California. About 200 years to 30 million years ago, the North American Plate collided with the Farallon Plate, causing earthquakes. Different rock types came from these collisions, including pillow basalt, chert, and sandstone. Goat Rock has a flat topped sea stack, made of greywacke. The rock \"formations\" (groups) are made of sandstone with layers of quartz."}

The larger grains can be sand-to-gravel-sized, and matrix materials make up more than 15% of the rock by volume. \nThe origin of greywacke was a problem. Gravel, sand and mud should not be laid down together, because river outflow drops heavier grains first. Now geologists think greywacke is formed by submarine avalanches or strong turbidity currents. These actions churn sediment and cause mixed-sediment slurries to occur. When this happens, the resulting rocks show various sedimentary features. Support for the turbidity current origin is the fact that deposits of greywacke are found on the edges of the continental shelves, at the bottoms of oceanic trenches, and at the bases of mountain formational areas. It also occurs in association with black shales of deep sea origin."}

The capital is Frauenfeld.\nGeography.\nTo the north of Thurgau is Lake Constance, across which are Germany and Austria. The river Rhine makes the border in the northwest. To the south is the Canton of St. Gallen; to the west are the cantons of Z\u00fcrich and Schaffhausen.\nThe area of the canton is 991\u00a0km2 and is usually divided into three hilly areas. One of these is along Lake Constance to the north. Another is inland between the rivers Thur and Murg. The third one makes the southern border of the canton and comes together with the H\u00f6rnli mountain in the pre-Alps.\nHistory.\nIn prehistoric times the lands of the canton were inhabited by people of the Pfyn culture along the lake. During Roman times the canton was part of the province \"Raetia\" until in 450 the lands were settled by the Alamanni. It was only in the 8th century that the canton became a political unit similar to what it is known today, as a Gau of the Frankish Empire. At the time, however, the area was not so clearly defined and changed frequently. Overall, the size of the Thurgau was larger, but during the Middle Ages the canton became smaller in size. The dukes of Z\u00e4hringen and the counts of Kyburg took over much of the land.\nThe town of Z\u00fcrich was part of the Thurgau until it became \"reichsunmittelbar\" in 1218. When the Kyburg dynasty became extinct in 1264 the Habsburgs took over that land. The Swiss confederation allied with ten freed bailiwicks of the former Toggenburg seized the lands of the Thurgau from the Habsburgs in 1460, and it became subject territory of Z\u00fcrich.\nIn 1798 the land became a canton for the first time as part of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 the canton of Thurgau became a member of the Swiss confederation. The current cantonal constitution dates from 1987.\nEconomy.\nThe canton of Thurgau is known for farm produce such as apples, pears, and other fruits and vegetables. The many orchards in the canton are used for the making of cider. Wine is produced in the Thur valley.\nThere is also industry in the canton of Thurgau.

The name means \"Gray Union\" in German and the canton lies entirely in the Alps. In Switzerland it hosts the biggest number of tourists each year.\nGeography.\nThe area of the canton is 7,105 km\u00b2. Only one third of this land is used for farming. Forests cover 20% of the total area. The canton has many mountains that make up the highlands of the Rhine and Inn river valleys. Many of its scenic areas are part of the Swiss National Park or the Ela Nature Park.\nThere are many important peaks in the Grison Alps, including the T\u00f6di at 3,614\u00a0meters and the highest peak Piz Bernina at 4,049\u00a0meters. Many of the mountain ranges feature huge glaciers, such as at the Adula, the Albula, the Silvretta, the Bernina, the Bregaglia and the R\u00e4tikon ranges. The mountain ranges in the central area contain many of the deepest vallies in Switzerland.\nThe canton borders Liechtenstein to the north, Austria to the north and the east, Italy to the south, and the cantons of St. Gallen to the northwest; Glarus and the canton of Uri to the west, and Ticino to the southwest. The capital city is Chur. Davos and St. Moritz are world-famous resorts and can be found in this area.\nHistory.\nMost of the lands of the canton were once part of a Roman province called \"Raetia\" that was established in 15 BC. The area later was part of the lands of the diocese at Chur.\nIn 1367 the League of God's House was founded against the power of the Bishop of Chur. This was followed by the making of the Grey League, sometimes called \"Oberbund\", in 1395 in the Upper Rhine valley. The name \"Grey League\" is derived from the homespun grey clothes worn by the people. The name of this league later gave its name to the canton of Graub\u00fcnden.\nThe first step towards the naming of the canton into Graub\u00fcnden was when the league of the Ten Jurisdictions allied with the League of God's House in 1450. In 1471, the two leagues aligned with the Grey League. This meant that the leagues allied with the Swiss Confederation. The Habsburgs were defeated at Calven Gorge and Dornach, helping the Swiss confederation and the allied leagues of the canton of Grisons to be recognized.\nThe last traces of the bishop of Chur's jurisdiction were abolished in 1526. The Musso war of the 1520 drove the Three Leagues closer to the Swiss Confederacy. The lands of the canton of Graub\u00fcnden were part of the Helvetic Republic, but the \"perpetual ally\" of Switzerland became a canton in 1803. The constitution of the canton dates from 1892.\nThe arms of the three original leagues are now all part of the coat of arms of the canton.\nPrivate cars were only allowed in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden after several votings in 1926.\nCulture.\nThe Graub\u00fcnden are known for a dried-beef delicacy called B\u00fcndnerfleisch and for a nut and honey pie known as B\u00fcndner Nusstorte. Another specialty, made mostly in the western part of Grison, is Capuns, a filling meal of pasta and a little bit of meat, rolled into Chard leaves, eventually baked in mode of a gratin with cheese.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture and tourism make up most of the canton's economy. Agriculture combines forests and mountain pasturage in summer, mostly beef but also sheep and goats. Tourism is all around the canton, mainly around the towns of Davos/Arosa, Flims and St. Moritz/Pontresina, which are important in both winter and summer. There are a great number of other resorts people visiting the country can go to in the canton.\nThere is wine production around the capital Chur. Chur is also the center of industry. In the southern valleys of Mesolcina/Misox and Poschiavo there is corn (maize) and chestnut farming.\nDemographics.\nThe languages spoken in Graub\u00fcnden are German in the northwest, Romansh in the Engadin and around Disentis/Must\u00e9r), and Standard Italian in the valleys Mesolcina/Misox, Calanca, Val Bregaglia, and Poschiavo.\nThe main religions are Protestantism and Catholicism. Both are well-represented in the canton, with Roman Catholics forming a slight majority.\nDistricts.\nGraub\u00fcnden is divided into 11 districts:\nMunicipalities.\nThere are 209 municipalities in Graub\u00fcnden (as of April 2004):"}

The population is 38,600 (in 2001). The capital is Stans.\nGeography.\nNidwalden is in the center of Switzerland. To the north is Lake Lucerne. Mountain ranges block in the rest of the canton on the other sides.\nHistory.\nIn 1291 the people of Nidwalden joined Uri and Schwyz to form an alliance. At the time there was no state, but towards the end of the 14th century early forms of government were established. This included institutionalized assemblies and courts. In the 14th and 15th century the people of Nidwalden joined the people of Obwalden to discuss important matters, but the two cantons were never really one. For example, Obwalden did not participate in the annexation of Bellinzona, Riviera and Blenio areas (today in the canton of Ticino).\nAround 1500 many people in Nidwalden worked as mercenary soldiers. Many of these soldiers later emigrated. This helped to lessen the pressure of a growing population. A popular destination was the Alsace. After rejecting a new constitution by Napoleon \u2014 the ideas of the French Revolution were not popular in such an agricultural area \u2014 Nidwalden was attacked by French troops on 9 September 1798. Random destruction was caused and at least 400 people were killed. After the end of Napoleon's rule in 1814 most of the changes were reverted. Only in 1877 did Nidwalden introduce a new constitution. The open assembly (\"Landsgemeinde\") was abolished in 1997.\nPolitics.\nThe government is composed of seven members. The local parliament has 60 seats.\nNidwalden sends only one deputy to the Swiss Council of States.\nEconomy.\nUp to the 1900s, Nidwalden was taken over by agriculture. Cattle and cheese were exported mainly to northern Italy. Around 1500, many people in Nidwalden worked as mercenary soldiers (people hired to fight for someone for money).\nFrom the middle of the 19th century onwards, trade, industry and tourism gained momentum. Still, until the 1950s, agriculture took over the canton. Today, many small and middle-sized businesses fill the economy. The largest employer is the airplane constructor Pilatus. The small and middle-sized businesses work in a lot of areas. Many provide work in machine construction, medical equipment, international trade, optics and electronics.\nTraditional areas such as forestry and agriculture are still important. Most farming is done with cattle and dairy products. Family farms are still common in Nidwalden today.\nIn recent years, Nidwalden is becoming an increasingly popular place to live and work. This is caused by its low taxes, its central location between Z\u00fcrich and Milan, and the pretty countryside.\nTourism.\nBecause of the mountainous geography, tourism is important to Nidwalden. The lake and mountains attract many tourists around the year.\nCulture.\nMany local charities have kept local traditions intact. There is traditional music, yodeling, dances, theaters and festivals. There are a number of modern cultural events, such as concerts and galleries.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are eleven municipalities: "}

The first railroad came to Schaffhausen in 1857.\nSchaffhausen is in a finger of Swiss land surrounded on three sides by Germany. On April 1, 1944, Schaffhausen suffered a bombing raid by United States Army Air Forces aircraft which strayed from German airspace into neutral Switzerland. While the United States immediately offered four million dollars in reparations, the raid occurred only a month after the Swiss Air Force had shot down an American bomber.\nIn 1947 it merged with the former municipality of Buchthalen. In 1964 it merged with the former municipality of Herblingen. Since 2009, Hemmental has been part of the town.\nIndustry.\nSchaffhausen has some well-known industrial companies (Georg Fischer) in piping systems, machine tools and automotives, one internationally-reputed watches manufacturer (IWC), and drug industry (Cilag, founded by Bernhard Joos)."}

It is the newest of the 26 Swiss cantons (created in 1979) and is in the northwestern part of Switzerland. The capital is Del\u00e9mont. It shares borders with the canton of Basel-Landschaft, the Canton of Bern, and the French d\u00e9partement of Jura.\nGeography.\nCanton Jura is in northwest Switzerland. It includes parts of the Jura mountains in the south and the Jura plateau in the north. The Jura plateau is hilly and almost entirely limestone.\nTo the north and the west of Jura is France. The canton of Solothurn and Basel-Landschaft are east of Jura, while the canton of Bern is south of Jura. The River Doubs and the river Birs drain the lands.\nHistory.\nThe king of Burgundy donated much of the land that today makes up Canton Jura to the Bishop of Basel in 999. The area was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire for more than 800 years. After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 the Jura had close ties with the Swiss Confederation. In the Congress of Vienna the Jura was given to the Canton Bern. This act caused dissension. The Jura was French-speaking and Roman Catholic, whereas the canton of Bern was mostly German-speaking and Protestant. The people of the Jura region called for independence. After a long struggle, a constitution was accepted in 1977. In 1978 the split was made official when the Swiss people voted in favour of it, and in 1979 the Jura joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member. However, the southern part of the Jura region, which is also predominantly French-speaking but has a Protestant majority, opted not to join the newly formed canton, and instead remained part of Bern. This area is now known as Bernese Jura. The word Jura, therefore, may refer either to Canton Jura, or to the combined territory of Canton Jura and Bernese Jura.\nOn creation, the canton adopted the title Republic and Canton of the Jura. Other cantons in Switzerland using the title \"Republic and Canton\" are Ticino, Canton Geneva, and Canton Neuch\u00e2tel. In each case the title asserts the autonomy of the canton and its nominal sovereignty within the Swiss Confederation.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is important in Canton Jura. Cattle breeding is significant and there is also horse breeding. The main industries are watches, clothing and tobacco. There are a growing number of small and middle-sized businesses.\nPeople.\nThe people are almost fully French-speaking. The majority is Roman Catholic.\nDistricts.\nJura is divided into 3 districts:\nMunicipalities.\nThis is a list of the canton's 83 municipalities by district."}

They have hook-like claws on their arms and legs to keep them attached to trees.\nLife.\nSloths are active at night and sleep curled up with their head placed between the arms and the feet drawn close together, or hanging upside down with the help of their hook- like claws. This disguises them as part of a tree so that its enemies like the jaguar do not see them. Sloths rarely climb down from the trees, and when they are on the ground they can only crawl awkwardly. However, when there is a forest flood, they are very good swimmers. Sloths can live for up to 30 years. They mostly just eat leaves and flowers, which take a very long time to digest.

He was governor of Hispaniola from 1502 until 1509. \nEarly life.\nNicolas de Ovando was born in 1460 in the town of Brozas, in Extremadura, Spain. His family was very religious and, when young, he joined the military religious \"Order of Alcantara\" where, in 1478, he was named \"Comendador de Lares\" (\"Commander of Lares\"), a very important position in the Order.\nGovernor of Hispaniola.\nAs \"Commander of Lares\", he was very appreciated by the Spanish Catholic Kings and, in particular, by Queen Isabella. On 3 September 1501 (Oviedo said in 1502), he was named as Governor of Hispaniola and of all lands discovered in America.\nOn 13 February, 1502 he went out of the port of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, Spain to go to the Hispaniola island with a fleet of 32 ships. On the fleet, there were 2,500 people, including priests, soldiers and colonists (some of them with their families), who were going to live in the Hispaniola. Among those colonists was Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, later known as the \"Protector of the Indians\", and also Francisco Pizarro, who conquered the Inca Empire.\nThe plan of Ovando was to develop the West Indies economically and expand the Spanish influence in the region.\nOvando got in Santo Domingo on 15 April 1502.\nAdministration.\nThe administration of Ovando in Hispaniola was one of great cruelty toward the Ta\u00edno Indians. When the Spaniards came to the island in 1492, the native population was 400,000 (estimated) but in 1508 there were only 60,000 Indians.\nBecause the new colonists needed more workers for the gold mines and farms, they brought, as slaves, Indians from the \"Lucayas\" (now, the Bahamas) islands. Then they brought slaves from Spain (\"Ladinos\", that is, of Africa origin but born in Spain); those were the first African slaves brought to America.\nOvando founded several cities (or ordered their foundations) on Hispaniola, among them: Compostela de Azua (or Azua de Compostela), Santa Mar\u00eda de la Vera Paz, Bayaj\u00e1 (today, Fort Libert\u00e9, in Haiti), Salvatierra de la Sabana (today, Les Cayes, in Haiti), Salvale\u00f3n de Hig\u00fcey, Cotu\u00ed, Puerto Plata, Santa Cruz de Hicayagua (today, Santa Cruz del Seibo, Dominican Republic).\nOvando sent Andr\u00e9s Morales to explore completely the Hispaniola island.

Sebasti\u00e1n de Ocampo was sent to find out if Cuba was an island or part of the continent; after 8 or 10 months, Ocampo came back with the information that Cuba was an island.

Internet memes are usually created when someone published something and that thing was shared widely over the Internet. They sometimes consist of an image with top and bottom text. While spreading over the internet, most internet memes 'evolve' over time, with the original image/video being changed in one way or another by people other than the creator. Every internet meme evolves and has many variants. See: Memes\nTwo other versions of Internet memes are \"\"dank memes\" and \"dead memes\"\". Dank memes are thought of as relevant and funny. Dead memes are thought of as not relevant or not funny, most of which haven't been uses in months or years. Dead memes, however, can become dank memes if used properly. \nSome websites where internet memes can be shared include Reddit, 4chan, 9gag, and IFunny. A popular chatting service where internet memes can be shared is Discord, an instant messaging and communication platform. Memes on Discord are shared through images, videos, and GIFs, although these methods aren't only limited to Discord.\nTypes of Memes.\nThere are many different types of internet memes. They include the following types.\nNormie Meme.\nA normie meme is a meme that uses intentionally bad, unfunny, or low-quality content to joke about said content. Some parodies could also be called normie memes, but those are another thing entirely.\nDank meme.\nA dank meme is a meme that makes no sense, similar to an normie meme. Dank memes, however, are usually very strange, involving seemingly random concepts that have been established in internet culture.\nsome dank memes can be offensive like the troll meme and forever alone memes while other dank memes are not.\nShock Meme.\nA shock meme is a meme that is either racist, sexist or offensive to a race of people, These memes often include societal status, videos where random jump scares and/or loud noises suddenly happen, hobbies, or anything at all.\nAn example of a shock memes are memes involving [[suicide]. When searching for \"suicide memes\" on [[[Google]], the first results will be suicide hotlines. The search engine is assuming the person searching was contemplating suicide, when in fact they were just searching for memes.\nVideo Meme.\nA video meme is a meme spread through [[video sharing]] sites such as [[YouTube]], Vimeo, and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]. Short videos can also be shared on social media services that supports video, such as [[TikTok]], [[Reddit]], and [[Facebook|Facebook.]]\nRelated pages.\n[[Category:Internet memes| ]]"}

It caused debates in the United States in 2006. The picture shows a naked Jesus Christ on the Cross with an erection. \nContext.\nIn 2005 the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The paper said that this was to add to the debate about criticism of Islam and self-censorship. Danish-Muslims said that they did not like them because Islam teaches that it is wrong for people to make any picture of Muhammad and also because they felt that the pictures showed disrespect to Muhammad. This led to protests in many Islamic countries, some of which became violent and led to more than 100 deaths. \nThe students of the University of Oregon said that they made the pictures of Jesus because they want to show how people who are religious feel when people make pictures that may be offensive to Jesus. They wanted to get Muslims and Christians to talk and understand each other better.\nReactions.\nSome people disliked the picture of Jesus with erection. The president of the Catholic League, William Donohue, said that the president of the Oregon University, Dave Frohnmayer, is partially responsible for the pictures. William Donohue said that the picture was one of the worst attacks on Christianity he had ever seen. Other people who disliked the picture said that the University's President David B. Frohnmayer should not work for the University any more. However, the Oregon Daily Emerald and the Oregon Commentator, said that the students' right to free speech and the University's decision to defend the student newspaper, citing the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States like the Southworth case. This case said that universities could support student groups (such as newspapers) that other students did not agree with without hurting the rights of the students who do not like the groups."}

{"id": "79062", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79062", "title": "Cockatoo", "text": "A cockatoo is any of the 21 species belonging to the bird family Cacatuidae, the only family in the superfamily Cacatuoidea. Along with the Psittacoidea (true parrots) and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots), they make up the order Psittaciformes (parrots).\nThe name \"cockatoo\" comes from the Malay name for these birds, \"kaka(k)tua\", via the Dutch \"kaketoe\".\nCockatoos are recognisable by the showy crests and curved and strong bills. Their plumage is generally less colourful than that of other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the Cockatiel, the smallest cockatoo species, is a small bird.\nDistribution and habitat.\nCockatoos have a much more restricted range than the true parrots, occurring naturally only in Australasia. Eleven of the 21 species exist in the wild only in Australia, while seven species occur only in the islands of the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Interestingly, no cockatoo species are found in Borneo (despite their presence on nearby Palawan and Sulawesi) or many Pacific islands, although fossil remains have been recorded from New Caledonia.\nThree species occur in both New Guinea and Australia. Some species have widespread distributions, with the Galah, for example, occurring over most of Australia, whereas other species have tiny distributions, confined to a small part of the continent, such as the Long-billed Black Cockatoo of Western Australia or to a small island group, such as the Tanimbar Corella, which is restricted to the Tanimbar Islands of Indonesia.\nCockatoos occupy a wide range of habitats, from forests in subalpine zones to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the Galah and Cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. Other cockatoo species, such as the Glossy Black Cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even forests with an alpine climate. The Philippine Cockatoo inhabits mangroves. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.\nTaxonomy.\nThe cockatoos were first defined as a subfamily Cacatuinae within the parrot family Psittacidae by the English naturalist George Robert Gray in 1840, with \"Cacatua\" the first listed and type genus. This group has alternately been considered as either a full family or a subfamily by different authorities. The American ornithologist James Lee Peters in his 1937 \"Check-list of Birds of the World\", Sibley and Monroe in 1990 maintained it as a subfamily, while parrot expert Joseph Forshaw classified it as a family in 1973. Subsequent molecular studies indicate that the earliest offshoot from the original parrot ancestors were the New Zealand parrots of the family Strigopidae, and following this the cockatoos, now a well-defined group or clade, split off from the remaining parrots, which then radiated across the southern hemisphere and diversified into the many species of parrots, parakeets, macaws, lories, lorikeets, lovebirds and other true parrots of the family Psittacidae.\nThe fossil record of cockatoos is even more limited than that of parrots in general, with only one truly ancient cockatoo fossil known: a species of \"Cacatua\", most probably subgenus \"Licmetis\", found in Early Miocene (16\u201323 million years ago) deposits of Riversleigh, Australia. Although fragmentary, the remains are similar to the Western Corella and the Galah.\nSpecies and subspecies.\nNames in parentheses after generic names indicate subgenera.\nThe current subdivision of this family is as follows:\nSubfamily Nymphicinae\nSubfamily Calyptorhynchinae: The black cockatoos\nSubfamily Cacatuinae\nMorphology.\nThe cockatoos are mostly medium to large parrots with a heavy, compact body. They range from in length and in weight. However, one species, the Cockatiel, is considerably smaller and slimmer than the other species, being long (including its long pointed tail feathers) and in weight.\nThe movable headcrest, which is present in all cockatoos, is spectacular in many species; it is raised when the bird lands from flying or when it is aroused.\nCockatoos share many features with other parrots, including the characteristic curved beak shape and a zygodactyl foot, with the two middle toes forward and the two outer toes backward. They differ however in a number of characteristics, including the presence of a gallbladder, some other anatomical details and their lack of the structures in the feathers which cause the bright blues and greens seen in true parrots.\nLike other parrots, cockatoos have short legs and strong claws, and often use their strong bill as a third limb when climbing through branches. They generally have long broad wings used in rapid flight, with speeds up to being recorded for galahs. The members of the genus \"Calyptorhynchus\" and larger white cockatoos, such as the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo and Major Mitchell's Cockatoo, have shorter, rounder wings and a more leisurely flight.\nBehaviour.\nCockatoos are active mainly during the day and require daylight to find their food. They eat a range of mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form a large part of the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The Galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees.\nLike most parrots, the cockatoos are made their nests in holes in trees, which they are unable to excavate themselves. These hollows are formed from decay or destruction of wood by branches breaking off, fungi or insects such as termites or even woodpeckers where their ranges overlap. In many places these holes are scarce and the source of competition, both with other members of the same species and with other species and types of animal. In general, cockatoos choose hollows only a little larger than themselves, hence different-sized species nest in holes of corresponding (and different) sizes.\nThe female lays two white eggs on small pieces of wood. The young, which is born naked and blind, is fed by the adults with partially digested food for about three months.\nStatus and conservation.\nAccording to the IUCN and BirdLife International, seven species of cockatoo are considered to be vulnerable or worse and one is considered to be near threatened. Of these, two species\u2014the Philippine Cockatoo (or Red-vented Cockatoo) and the Yellow-crested Cockatoo\u2014are considered to be critically endangered.\nThe principal threats to cockatoos are habitat loss and the trade in wild animals. All cockatoos nest in trees, and are vulnerable to their loss. Also, many species have specific habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them especially vulnerable.\nCockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded Salmon-crested Cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia.\nAll species of cockatoo except the Cockatiel are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five cockatoo species (including all subspecies)\u2014the Tanimbar Corella (\"Cacatua goffiniana\"), Philippine Cockatoo (\"Cacatua haematuropygia\"), Moluccan Cockatoo (\"Cacatua moluccensis\"), Yellow-crested Cockatoo (\"Cacatua sulphurea\") and Palm Cockatoo (\"Probosciger aterrimus\")\u2014are protected on the CITES Appendix I list. With the exception of the Cockatiel, all remaining cockatoo species are protected on the CITES Appendix II list."}

The Soviet Union used it during World War II as a fighter interceptor as most air battles at the Eastern front were fought at low heights. Very near the ground the Airacobra became extremely maneuverable and could out-turn any German airplane. The Russians liked the plane, and they often removed the wing guns to make it even more maneuvreable. Several Soviet pilots became fighter aces on P-39. The main weapon of P-39, a 37 mm cannon, was so powerful that it could destroy almost any airplane on a single hit.\nThe pilot who scored the most aerial victories was Grigori Rechkalov of the Soviet Air Force. He shot down 57 Germans with Airacobra. His squadronmate Aleksandr Pokryshkin had 59 victories, of which 47 were with Airacobra.\nThe P-39 was different from most aircraft in World War II. It had \"tricycle\" landing gear, doors that opened like a car (pilots would climb out of most fighters of the time) and the engine was behind the pilot. The \"Q\" version could go 375 miles per hour (600 km/h), had four 12.7mm machine guns, and one 37mm cannon."}

The next morning, after passing over the state, Tropical Storm Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico, strengthened back to hurricane strength, and from the influence of the warm waters from the Loop Current, began undergoing rapid deepening.\nAt 11:00\u00a0p.m. EDT August 26, approximately 56\u00a0hours before Katrina's landfall near Buras, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center had predicted that the New Orleans metropolitan area could face a direct hit by the storm. As New Orleans is located on the Mississippi River delta and much of the city is below sea level, a strong hurricane could have a devastating effect on the city. Previous warnings, such as the one made by the Houston Chronicle in 2001, told of a disaster that \"would strand 250,000 people or more, and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under 20 feet of water\" following a severe hurricane making landfall on the city. The National Hurricane Center's director, Max Mayfield, mentioned that the Mississippi/Louisiana area has \"the greatest potential for nightmare scenarios,\" and that this has been known for at least the three decades he has worked at the NHC. Other publications, such as \"Popular Mechanics\", \"Scientific American\", and The Times-Picayune predicted doomsday situations in which a sinking city would drown and its residents would be left homeless.\nIn 1965, Hurricane Betsy made landfall just south of New Orleans, causing widespread flooding in the city. As a result, a system of levees was authorized by Congress to handle future storm events. However, the protection given by this system was limited to hurricanes up to Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.\nThree days before Katrina's second and third landfalls, the National Hurricane Center began predicting that the storm would make landfall as a major hurricane. By the next morning, on August 27, the NHC gave out a hurricane watch that included the New Orleans metro area, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning by 10:00\u00a0p.m. CDT that same evening. At this point, Katrina was a Category 3 hurricane with 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) winds and about 335\u00a0miles (540\u00a0km) to the south-southeast of the Mississippi River's mouth.\nThat night, the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening, strengthening to a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h) by 10:00 am CDT on August 28. At that time, the Weather Forecasting Office in Slidell, Louisiana issued an \"urgent weather message\" describing the destruction Katrina would likely cause in the region:\nBulletin text.\nAt 10:11\u00a0a.m. CDT (1511 UTC), Robert Ricks, a meteorologist with the New Orleans/Baton Rouge NWS office, issued the following statement:\nAn equally-explicit bulletin was repeated at 4:13\u00a0p.m. CDT.\nImpact.\nIn the following months after the storm, Congress appointed a two-party system committee to look into the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations before to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives.\nDuring an internal assessment by the National Weather Service, the 10:11 bulletin and its impact were examined. The report called the bulletin \"a significant moment for the NWS during Katrina,\" as its detailed and specific language did not have any previous precedent (though the message was based on a template designed by the Tampa Weather Office in 1990). The strongly-worded statement persuaded people to evacuate, and was highlighted by national news media. As a result, the level of detail was highlighted as an \"innovative best practice\" in the NWS assessment, which recommended issuing warnings with similar levels of detail in the future."}

They are a part of the animal family Mustelid. A group of otters is called a \"romp\", because they play together and are energetic. They live in nests called holts. There are many different kinds of otters. Some live near rivers, some in the sea (sea otters). Otters live on every continent except for Australia and Antarctica.\nDescription.\nOtters are long and slim animals that can be longer than a meter. They have four short legs. They usually stay on all four legs, but they can stand up as well but they are expert swimmers and spend a lot of time in water. They have a thick fur coat that keeps them warm even in freezing water. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry and warm under water. They keep the air topped up by blowing into the fur with their mouth. Their fur is often brown at the top, and lighter underneath the Otter.\nThey eat meat and hunt for fish and small animals, so they have sharp claws and teeth that allow them to catch prey, then eat them. They are great swimmers and divers; they can stay underwater for 8 minutes. Their thick and long tail helps them steer while swimming underwater. Also, their feet are webbed, which helps them swim. On they ground, they can run very fast.\nOtters live 8 to 9 years in the wilderness, and as many as 21 years when living with people.\nDiet.\nOtters are carnivores; they must eat a lot of meat to live, so they spend 3 to 5 hours every day fishing and hunting. They can die of hunger more quickly than most animals. They eat fish, crayfish, crabs, and frogs. They will eat any small animals and birds they can catch. Much of their food is found in water. They dive in rivers, lakes and streams until they can find a suitable animal to eat, which they then chase. Once they catch it, they bring it to the top of the water, where they eat it. If the animal has a hard shell, otters can use a rock as a tool to break open the shell.\nBehaviour.\nOtters are playful and energetic. They can be seen sliding down hills and slopes, as well as chasing other otters for fun. Some kinds of otters live in groups, while others are almost always alone. Because they spent so much time in cold water, they have to groom their fur often to stop themselves from freezing.\nCommunication.\nOtters talk to other animals and otters with whistles, growls, chuckles and screams, as well as chirps, squeals, and some kinds of otters might even purr. They also leave their scent on plants to mark their territory.\nSea otter.\nSea otters (\"Enhydra lutris\") are classified as marine mammals. They live along the Pacific coast of North America. Their historic range included shallow waters of the Bering Strait. It also included Kamchatka, and as far south as Japan. Sea otters have about 26,000 to 165,000 hairs per square centimeters of skin. They have a rich fur for which humans hunted them almost to extinction. They frequently carry a rock in a pouch under their forearm. They use this to smash open shells. This makes them one of the few animals that use tools. They grow to in length and weigh . Although once near extinction, they have begun to spread again, from remnant populations in California and Alaska.\nEuropean otter.\nThe European otter (\"Lutra lutra\") was common as recently as the 1950s, but became rare because of DDT pesticides, habitat loss and water pollution. Hunting of otters was also common. They stayed relatively common in parts of Scotland and Ireland, but numbers in England reached a low point in the 1980s. They are now recovering strongly. Otters are now quite common, especially in the west of England. Roadkill deaths are now happening more.\nSpecies.\nThere are 13 types of otters in the world. They are"}

Today, many ADSL implementations use ATM technology.\nStandards like Ethernet (which is used for LANs) usually are quite simple. When there is little traffic on the network they work well. However, when there is a lot of traffic it is difficult to predict how an Ethernet network will behave. For this reason, Ethernet cannot give any service guarantees. It is not possible to say that an Ethernet packet will take a maximum delay, but after that time it is guaranteed to arrive.\nATM is more complex, but this complexity allows to give guarantees as to data rate, maximum delay, and jitter. These are usually called Quality of Service. "}

It describes the type of blood a person has. It is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).\nBlood types predict whether a serious reaction will occur in a blood transfusion. This reaction is called a \"haemolytic reaction\". It may destroy red blood cells, and cause renal failure. Shock is likely to occur, and death is a possibility.\nWhen a blood transfusion or an organ transplant takes place, it is vital to know the blood types of the donor (who gives blood) and the receiver (who needs blood).\nThere are a number of human blood group systems. Of these systems, the ABO blood group system and the Rhesus blood group system are the most important. In this system the presence or absence of the A-antigen, the B-antigen and the RhD-antigen are determined.\nABO system.\nThe principle.\nThe principle of the ABO system is that antigens \u2013 in this instance, sugars exposed on the surface of red blood cells \u2013 differ between individuals. This first discovered by Karl Landsteiner. People have immunological tolerance only for what occurs in their own bodies. As a result, humans may produce antibodies against natural components in the bodies of \"other\" people, but not themselves. So, people may produce antibodies against A and/or B antigens if they are not in their blood.\nThese antibodies clump red blood cells together if they carry the foreign antigens. This harsh response can cause death when large amounts of such cells are encountered after a blood transfusion. Because A and B antigens are chemically modified from a precursor form that is also present in type O individuals, people with type A and B antigens can accept blood from type O individuals.\nAnti-A and anti-B antibodies are not present in the newborn. They appear in the first years of life. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually too big to pass through the placenta to the foetal blood circulation.\nThe test.\nIn a laboratory, blood is tested for antigens. When a certain antigen is found, there are also always antibodies found. Antibodies attack (attach to) antigens that they do not recognise.\nThe blood is thus tagged as being \"A positive\", \"O negative\" for instance, where the letter refers to the ABO blood group and \"positive\" or \"negative\" refers to whether or not the RhD-antigen of the Rhesus blood group system was found. It can also be written \"A+ \" and \"O-\", respectively.\nCompatibility.\nPeople with type O negative blood are often called universal donors because they can give blood to any other blood group. People with type AB positive blood are called universal recipients because they can receive blood from any other blood group.\nRhesus factor.\nThe Rh factor (Rh meaning Rhesus) is a feature of the second most common blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. it is named after the Rhesus monkey where they were first discovered. Rh is an inherited trait, which refers to a protein on the surface of an individual's red blood cells.\nThe Rh factor is separate from, and in addition to, ABO groups. The Rh factor is either present on individual's red blood cells or it is not. Rh positive means the factor is present. Rh negative means it is not present. In blood transfusions it is important that the blood donor and recipient have the same Rh factor and same blood group.\nBefore a transfusion takes place blood is thoroughly tested for anything that might cause problems for the receiver."}

Although Pepys had no maritime experience, he rose by patronage, hard work and his talent for administration.\nThe detailed private diary that he kept from 1660\u20131669 was first published in the nineteenth century. It is one of the most important primary sources for the English Restoration period. It provides a combination of personal notes and eyewitness accounts of great events, such as the Great Plague of London, the Second Dutch War and the Great Fire of London.\nGreat Fire of London.\nPepys was a key person in the fire of 1666. Seeing that the wind was driving the fire westward, he ordered the boat to go to Whitehall, and became the first person to inform the King of the fire. The King told him to go to the Lord Mayor, and tell him to start pulling houses down.\nPepys took a coach back to Old St Paul's Cathedral, before setting off on foot through the burning city. He found the Lord Mayor, who said: \"Lord! what can I do? I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.\"\nAt noon Pepys went home and 'had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry, as at this time we could be'. In the evening he and his wife watched the fire from the safety of Bankside: Pepys writes that 'it made me weep to see it'. Returning home, Pepys met his clerk, Tom Hayter, who had lost everything. Hearing news that the fire was advancing, Pepys started to pack up his possessions by moonlight.\nA cart arrived at 4am on 3 September, and Pepys spent much of the day arranging the removal of his possessions. Many of his valuables, including his diary, were sent to friend. The next day, Pepys continued to arrange the removal of his possessions. By this point, he believed that Seething Lane was in grave danger, and suggested calling men from Deptford to help pull down houses and defend the king's property. He described the chaos in the city, and his curious attempt at saving his own goods:\nOn Wednesday, 5 September, Pepys \u2013 who had taken to sleeping on his office floor \u2013 was woken by his wife at 2am. She told him that the fire had almost reached All Hallows-by-the-Tower, and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold \u2013 about \u00a32350 \u2013 to Woolwich. In the following days Pepys witnessed looting, disorder and disruption. On 7 September he went to Paul's Wharf and saw the ruins of St Paul's Cathedral, of his old school and of his father's house. Despite all this destruction, Pepys's house, office and diary had been saved.\nThe Diary.\nThe complete and definitive edition of Pepys's diary by Robert Latham and William Matthews was published by Bell &amp; Hyman, London, in 1970\u20131983.\nIt is one of England's prized possessions\nOther websites.\nSome of the older editions of the diary are available online.\nThere are also two encyclopedic sites about Pepys based on these free editions\nAs well as other sites about Pepys."}

{"id": "79231", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79231", "title": "Albatross", "text": "Albatrosses are large seabirds which belong to the biological family Diomedeidae. They live in the region of the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean. They are not found in the North Atlantic region, but their fossils have been found there, which shows that they used to live there. There are four main species of albatross: Great Albatrosses, North Pacific Albatrosses, Mollymawks and Sooty Albatrosses. These are divided into twenty-one species identified by the World Conservation Union (ICUN).\nGreat Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds. They are very big. All albatrosses are very good at flying, spending much of their life in the air. They eat squid, fish and krill. Albatrosses come ashore to make their nests, mostly on islands, and usually near the nests of other birds.\nNineteen of the twenty-one species of albatross are endangered. This is partly because animals such as rats and cats attack their eggs, chicks, and sometimes adult birds as well. Pollution of the oceans, such as plastic waste and oils spills, also kills albatrosses. Sometimes there may be not enough fish to eat because of over-fishing. The main reason why albatross are endangered is longline fishing which causes many albatross to get caught on hooks that have been baited to catch fish. This causes the birds to drown.\nBiology.\nFlight.\nAlbatrosses are very large. The bill is large, strong and sharp. This bill is made of horny plates. Along the sides are the two \"tubes\". They are actually long nostrils. The tubes of all albatrosses are on the sides of the bill. They help the albatrosses develop their sense of smell a lot. The feet have no last toe and the three other toes are all webbed. Their legs are quite strong, and they can walk well on land, unlike other sea birds.\nAlbatrosses need to take salt out of their body because they drink ocean water. All birds have a large gland at the top part of their bill, above their eyes. This gland is sometimes useless to birds that do not need it. However, albatrosses use them to help take out saltwater. Scientists are not sure how it works exactly. However, they know that it helps take out the salt. It makes a liquid that makes the saltwater drip out of their nose.\nThe adult albatrosses usually have a dark upper-wing and back, and white undersides when they are getting ready to take flight. Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult feathers.\nThe wings of the largest albatrosses (genus \"Diomedea\") can be up to .\nAlbatrosses flying north from their family sometimes fly in a clockwise direction, and those flying south will fly the opposite. The most energy used up in their journey is not when they travel a long way, but when they land, take-off, and hunt. This helps the albatross fly more longer distances and find good food. They can fly easily over wind and waves. However, because their long wings do not have strong muscles or energy, they cannot flap while they fly. Because of this, albatrosses in calm seas must stop and rest on the surface of the ocean until the wind begins to blow harder. When taking-off, albatrosses need to run first to help the wing make lift. Albatrosses are known for their clumsiness when landing.\nLocations.\nMost albatrosses are found in the southern hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. However, the four North Pacific albatrosses live elsewhere. Three of them are in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska. The last one, the Waved Albatross, is in the Galapagos Islands and finds food in the coast of South America.\nIt is not known clearly why the albatrosses became extinct in the North Atlantic. Some think that it was because the sea level rose at that time. Some kind of albatrosses that live in the south have usually been trapped in the North Atlantic, and are forced to stay there for a long time.\nSometimes scientists may use the satellite when trying to learn about albatrosses. They try to find out about the way albatrosses go across the ocean to find food with the satellites. There is proof that the sea separates different kinds of species of the Albatross. There is also proof of different pathways for the two sexes of the same kind of species. A study of Tristan Albatrosses living on the Gough Island showed that males look for food on the west and the females go around the east.\nDiet.\nThe albatross eats cephalopods, fish, crustaceans and offal. Sometimes, they may also eat carrion and or other kinds of zooplankton. However, the importance of each food is different according to each species. Some may like to eat only squids, or others might eat more krill or fish. From the two albatross species that live in Hawaii, one of them, the Black-footed Albatross, eats mostly fish. The other one, the Laysan Albatross, eats more squids instead.\nSometimes albatrosses may use the help of other animals to eat. For example, some squids are too big to be caught alive by the albatross. Instead, albatrosses eat squids that die after mating, or after they have been vomited by squid-eating whales (such as sperm whales and pilot whales). Other species, like the Black-browed Albatross or the Grey-headed Albatross, eat smaller species of squid that sink after they die, and they do not scavenge a lot. Also, sometimes the Waved Albatross has been seen stealing food from other birds.\nUntil now, it was thought that the albatrosses ate and found their food at the surface of the sea, this included dead squid and fish pushed to the surface by the waves, other animals that had eaten them, or death. This was thought because some species do not dive deeper than a metre. However, this theory was not true because some species have a mean (average) diving depth of almost 5\u00a0metres and can dive as deep as 12.5\u00a0metres. They have now been seen to eat from the surface, diving to catch prey and sometimes also plunging from the air to snatch their prey.\nBreeding and dancing.\nAlbatrosses live together, and they usually nest on islands where no people live. Many Buller's Albatrosses and Black-footed Albatrosses nest under trees in open forest. Albatrosses usually come back to their own group after leaving for a while to find a mate. This is one of their strongest instinct, and the study of Laysan Albatross showed that the normal distance between the place where it was hatched and the place where the bird made its own territory was 22m (72 ft).\nLike most seabirds, albatrosses live much longer than other birds. They also do not look for their mate for a long time, and do not have a lot of young. Some kinds of albatrosses live up to 50 years. The oldest albatross recorded was the Northern Royal Albatross that lived for 61 years.\nBefore albatrosses mate, they group together and spend lots of years practicing the mating rules and special \"dances\" that the family is famous for.\nWhen the albatrosses learn these kind of actions and dances, they also learn things such as pointing, calling, making noises with their bill, staring, and sometimes all of them put together. When a bird first comes it will dance with many other albatrosses, but after a few years, the number of birds it will dance with will lessen until one of the birds are chosen. After becoming a pair, they will never use that dance again.\nAlbatrosses have a hard time laying their children. It takes a lot of time for an albatross to lay an egg and raise a chick. The great albatrosses take over a year to raise a chick. Albatrosses lay one egg, white with reddish brown spots. But if the egg is taken by other predators or accidentally broken, the parents will not lay another egg for that whole year. The larger eggs weigh from 200\u2013510 g (7.1\u201318\u00a0oz). Two albatrosses do not usually \"divorce\". This sometimes may happen if several years passed without being able to lay a single egg.\nAll the albatrosses in the south live in large nests. They make it with grass, soil, and sometimes penguin feathers. The Waved Albatross, however, does not make a nest but instead moves its egg around the pair\u2019s territory, as much as 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft). This may sometimes make it lose the egg. In all albatross species, both parents incubate the egg from between one day and three weeks. Incubation lasts around 70 to 80 days. This time may become more longer for the larger albatrosses. When they do this, it takes a lot of energy, and the adult can lose as much as 83\u00a0g (2.9\u00a0oz) of body weight a day.\nAfter hatching, the chick is taken care of and guarded for three weeks until it is large enough to take care of and fight for itself. During this time the parents feed the chick small meals. After the chick has grown a little older, it is fed in bigger meals by both parents. The parents both take turns to go and find food, that are about 12% of their body weight (around 600\u00a0g (21\u00a0oz)). They find food such as fresh squid, fish and krill.\nAlbatross chicks take a long time to fledge (learn how to fly). In the case of more bigger albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days. And even for the smaller albatrosses, it can take from 140 to 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks later become even heavier than their mother and father. When they are preparing their body for flying, they may also grow flight feathers, which makes them sometimes as heavy as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those who fledged survive to find their mate after. Albatross chicks learn to fly on their own. Their parents do not teach them, and instead they return to the nest even after their chick has left.\nAlbatrosses and humans.\nName.\nThe name \"albatross\" came from the Arabic word \"al-c\u00e2dous\" or \"al-\u0121a\u0163\u0163\u0101s\". This means a pelican, or can mean \"the diver\". This word later became English, also mixed with the Portuguese word \"alcatraz\", which means \"gannet\". This is also where the name of the prison Alcatraz comes from. The \"OED\" explains that the word \"alcatraz\" was at first supposed to be used for the frigatebird. But perhaps the change of the word to \"albatross\" was because of the Latin word \"albus\". This means \"white\", which is opposite to the frigatebirds which are black. In Portuguese, the word still presently used for the bird, \"albatroz,\" came from the English albatross.\nThey were once known as Goonie birds or Gooney birds, especially the albatrosses in the North Pacific. In the southern hemisphere, most people still call the albatross mollymawk, which came from the word \"malle-mugge\", an old Dutch. The name \"Diomedea\", given to the albatrosses by Linnaeus, is from the story about the Greek warrior Diomedes becoming a bird.\nCulture.\nAlbatrosses have been described as \"the most legendary of all birds\". When people are sad or feel they are carrying a burden, they may use the expression 'to have an albatross around their neck'. There is a myth that sailors do not shoot or eat albatrosses because they think it will bring bad luck, but in reality sailors regularly killed and ate them. They were often thought of as the souls of lost sailors. The M\u0101ori people used the wing bones of the albatross to carve tattoos into their skin at ceremonies.\nHuman threats.\nEven though they were legendary birds in many myths, albatrosses were still attacked by humans. In the beginning, Polynesians and Aleut people hunted albatrosses. As Europeans began to explore the world, they too began to hunt albatross. They \"fished\" for them from boats and ate them or killed them for sport.\n Of the 21 albatross species noted by the IUCN on their list, 19 are threatened, and the other two are very near to being threatened. Two species are thought of as endangered. This is mostly because albatrosses die while eating fishing bait.\nIn the Midway Islands there have been many airplane crashes because of collisions with Laysan Albatrosses, causing fatalities in both the albatross and human population. Tall towers killed 3000 birds in between the years 1964-1965. Because of this, the towers were taken down. Recently, people have tried to stop human activity in the islands and this has helped lessen the number of birds dying.\nAnother threat to albatrosses are introduced species, like rats or feral cats (cats that live without being cared for by people), which attack the albatross or its chicks and eggs. Albatrosses have lived on islands where there are few land mammals and they are not adapted to defend themselves against them. Even animals such as mice can be dangerous. For example, on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan Albatrosses are often attacked and eaten alive by house mice.\nSometimes albatrosses, as well as many other kinds of seabirds, are killed because they eat plastic. The amount of plastic eaten in the seas has increased very quickly since the first record in the 1960s. This is because of waste thrown overboard by ships and trash dumped in the ocean. Sometimes litter on beaches has been washed into the sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest plastic, and the undigested plastic stops other food from being digested. This makes birds starve and die. The plastic can even be vomited out and fed to the chicks by the parents. Although plastic is not the main reason why albatrosses die, it is still a serious problem.\nScientists and people who try to help albatrosses are working with governments and fishermen to stop these threats. They have come up with solutions such as fishing at night, dying the bait a blue color to hide it from the albatrosses, setting the bait under the water, and more. For example, a study by some scientists and fishermen in New Zealand tested putting the fishing lines below the reach of certain kinds of albatross species. The use of some of these ideas has been successful by stopping the number of Black-browed Albatross that died in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on taking away introduced species to protect the albatrosses.\nOne important step towards protecting albatrosses and other seabirds is the 2001 treaty known as the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, signed by thirteen countries, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, South Africa, France, Peru, Uruguay and the United Kingdom. One of the Agreement's key activities is to provide expert advice on seabird bycatch mitigation to fisheries managers, both in domestic and high seas fisheries."}

It is in the constellation of Centaurus.\nProxima Centauri was found to share the same proper motion as Alpha Centauri in 1915 by Robert Innes while he was Director of the Union Observatory in Johannesburg, South Africa.\nIn 1951, Harlow Shapley said that Proxima Centauri was a flare star. Recorded photographs showed that the star became measurably brighter about 8% of the time, making it the most active flare star then found.\nCharacteristics.\nRed dwarfs are usually far too faint to be seen with the naked eye, that means without a telescope. Proxima Centauri has an apparent magnitude of 11 while its absolute magnitude is a very dim 15.5. Even from Alpha Centauri A or B, Proxima would only be seen as a 5th magnitude star.\nProxima Centauri has been the closest star to the Sun for about the last 32,000 years. Barnard's Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around AD 11,700, when it approaches to within about 3.8 light-years. However, at that time, it will \"not\" be the nearest star, since Proxima Centauri will then have moved even closer to the Sun. Six stars will come closer to Earth in the next 45,000 years.\nPlanetary system.\nIn 2016, a exoplanet was found by the European Southern Observatory around Proxima Centauri, Proxima Centauri b (or Proxima b). It was found in the habitable zone, and was thought to be Earth-like, with an ESI of 0.87. While being Earth-like, it may not be habitable on the surface, since Proxima Centauri gives off strong solar flares and high solar winds, which could strip away parts of the atmosphere of the planet, making it less habitable.\nIn October of 2016, scientists at France's CNRS research institute said that the planet may have oceans on its surface, and a thin atmosphere. If this idea is true or not is not known.\nAnother planet, Proxima Centauri c, much farther out than b, was discovered in 2019. It is seven times heavier (more massive) than Earth. It is too cold to be habitable. Because it showed up brighter than expected when photos of it were taken, it may have a ring system five times wider than that of Jupiter."}

It is named after the Jura mountains.\nThe largest city in the department is Dole but its prefecture (capital) is the city of Lons-le-Saunier.\nHistory.\nHistorically, Jura belonged to the Free County of Burgundy, known in French as the Franche-Comt\u00e9. Dole was the capital until the region was conquered by Louis XIV. Louis XIV moved the capital to Besan\u00e7on and Dole is now a \"sous-pr\u00e9fecture\" of Jura.\nAs early as the 13th century, inhabitants of the southern 2/3 of Jura spoke a dialect of Arpitan language. It continued to be spoken in rural areas into the 20th century.\nJura is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790. It was created from part of the former province of Free County. The department was created with six districts: Dole, Lons-le-Saunier, Orgelet, Poligny, Saint-Claude and Salins; the capital was Lons-le-Saunier alternating with Dole, Poligny and Salins but from 1794 only Lons-le-Saunier remained as the capital.\nIn 1800, with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in France, the six districts were changed into four \"arrondissements\": Lons-le-Saunier, Dole, Poligny and Saint-Claude. On 10 September 1926, the \"arrondissement\" of Poligny was eliminated.\nGeography.\nJura is part of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. It has an area of .\nThe department borders with 5 departments in two regions. The Swiss canton of Vaud is to the southeast.\nThe highest point in the department is Cr\u00eat Pela (), high; it is also the highest mountain of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. The \"Cr\u00eat Pela\" mountain is in the \"For\u00eat du Massacre\", Jura mountain range.\nMany lakes can be found throughout the Jura department. The largest natural lake in the department is the Lac De Chalain. It is long and wide. Lac de Vouglans was formed after the building of a hydro-electric dam; it is one of the largest man-made lakes in France.\nThe Ain river starts in the Jura department but it is the main river of the Ain department. The Doubs also flows through a part of the department. Many tributaries of both rivers flow, partially or completely, in the Jura department.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Jura varies greatly by elevation. The lower valleys are temperate and pleasant, but the high mountain valleys have bitterly cold winters.\nAdministration.\nJura is managed by the \"Departmental Council of Jura\" in Lons-le-Saunier. The department is part of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 region.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThere are 3 \"arrondissements\" (districts), 17 \"cantons\" and 509 \"communes\" (municipalities) in Jura.\nThe following is a list of the 17 cantons of the Jura department (with their INSEE codes), following the French canton reorganisation which came into effect in March 2015:\nDemographics.\nJura had a population, in 2014, of 260,681, for a population density of inhabitants/km2. The \"arrondissement\" of Lons-le-Saunier, with 126,071 inhabitants, is the \"arrondissement\" with more inhabitants.\nEvolution of the population in Jura\nThe cities with more than inhabitants in the department are:\nEconomy.\nJura is a wine-growing region. The Jura wines are very distinctive and unusual wines, such as vin jaune, which is made by a similar process to sherry. It develops under a flor of yeast. This is made from the local Savagnin grape variety. Other grape varieties include Poulsard, Trousseau, and Chardonnay.\nTourism.\nThe Jura mountains provide ample opportunities for hiking, skiing, mountain biking and other winter sports."}

She is the \"chosen one\" in a time where vampires (called \"lurks\") are common, and the difference between rich and poor people is even greater. \nThe series was published by Dark Horse Comics beginning in 2001. In a short video promoting the charity Equality Now Joss Whedon said that \"Fray is not done, Fray is coming back. More than that, I will not say.\" This was repeated in 2007's Comic Con where Joss said that he would \"absolutely would be returning to that world.\" \nThe series was closely linked to the seventh season of \"Buffy\". It includes the Slayer's mystical scythe and her origins. Melaka Fray also appears in the story \"Tales\" in the comic book \"Tales of the Slayers\". \nConnections to \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\".\nFray's scythe was used in the last three episodes of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". Buffy Summers, also a vampire Slayer, found the scythe stuck in rock in Sunnydale. The scythe was later used to create fully developed Slayers of the many Potential Slayers. It has never been stated as to how the scythe travelled from Sunnydale, California to New York City through the centuries, or who had it during that time (or how they got it).\nIn \"Fray\" it is also explained that sometime in the twenty-first century, \"a Slayer, possibly with some mystical allies, faced an apocalyptic army of demons. And when it was done, they were gone. All demons, all magicks, banished from this earthly dimension,\". The Slayer, whose fate is unknown, was the last to be called.\nDiscussing her connection to the Slayer line, Urkonn tells Melaka, \"In your dreams, you're someone else. A slave. A princess. A girl in school in a sunlit city.\" The scar Fray has and her personality are similar to Buffy in the alternate universe created in season 3 episode \"The Wish\". "}

He is mainly remembered today for the strange ways he behaved. He often gave his music unusual titles such as \"Piece in the form of a pear\". His best known musical compositions are the three piano pieces which he called \"Gymnop\u00e9dies\". The first of these pieces is a very famous piece of music: it is a simple tune over a gentle accompaniment. Satie sometimes used unusual instruments such as sirens and typewriters.\nSatie was more than just an unusual man. He was very important in the development of music in France in the late 19th and early 20th century. He was important because of the ideas he had, and many people were influenced by him. Satie used ways of composing such as very chromatic music and Minimalism before many other people. These ways of writing music became more common later in the century. Satie was not a brilliant composer, but he was happy to compose well in a simple way. He was also interested in other arts such as literature and painting and he was associated with the new ideas called \"esprit nouveau\" (new spirit) which was fashionable in France around the time of World War I.\nHis Life.\nEarly years.\nHe was born Alfred Eric Leslie Satie, but as a grown-up he always spelled his name \u201cErik\u201d. His father had been in the shipping business, but the family then moved to Paris. He was still quite young when his mother died and he was sent back to his birthplace, Honfleur, to be brought up by his father\u2019s parents. However, his grandmother drowned, so he was sent back to Paris again where his father taught him. His father had married again. His new wife was a pianist and sent young Eric to have piano lessons at the Paris Conservatoire.\nSatie hated his piano lessons. His teacher said that he was the laziest pupil in the Conservatoire. He was bad at sight-reading, but he continued with his lessons because this would make it possible for him to do just one year of military service instead of five. In fact, he did less than a year in the army because he deliberately got himself ill with bronchitis. While he was getting better he started to compose. His father published a few songs he had written. However, he did not get on well with his family and he left home in 1887.\nThe young Satie.\nSatie soon got to know many people in the famous cabaret Chat Noir. He grew his hair long and wore a frock coat and a top hat. He wrote a ballet which most people found shocking. He became friends with Debussy who was one of the only people who understood the serious reasons for Satie\u2019s unusual behaviour.\nIn 1890 he moved to new rooms on a top floor of a house so that people to whom he owed money could not get at him. He tried to compose in a simple style and became interested in mystical religion and Gothic art. He inherited a small amount of money with which he bought himself seven velvet suits which were all exactly the same: one for each day of the week. He started a church called \u00c9glise M\u00e9tropolitaine d\u2019Art de J\u00e9sus Conducteur (Metropolitan Church of Art of Conductor Jesus), but nobody belonged to the church except himself.\nAt the end of 1898 he moved to Arceuil, a suburb of Paris. He spent the rest of his life there. He stopped performing in public and earned money by playing the piano in caf\u00e9s and pubs. Every morning he walked the 10 kilometres into Paris, stopping on the way at caf\u00e9s to drink or compose. He wore a bowler hat, wing collar and always carried a rolled-up umbrella. If it was raining he kept his umbrella underneath his coat to keep it dry. He also carried a hammer in case anyone attacked him. Late at night he walked home again or took the last train back. His flat was a terrible mess.\nRise to fame.\nIn 1905, at the age of 39, he became a student again and studied music at the Schola Cantorum. He wanted to become a better composer. He learned how to write fugues. He still liked to use parody in his music.\nIn 1911 Maurice Ravel played some of Satie\u2019s piano pieces in public. Suddenly people began to take notice of Satie. They realized that he had been one of the first Impressionist composers. Debussy conducted his \"Gymnop\u00e9dies\" in his arrangement for orchestra. Music critics started to write articles about Satie. He was at last becoming famous. He had some humorous piano pieces published. He was earning some money from his compositions, so he was able to give up playing in cabarets. He met Jean Cocteau who introduced him to Diaghilev for whom he wrote the music for \"Parade\". Some people loved it, some hated it, but people were taking notice of him. He was asked to write more theatre music. He was a very important influence on the six composers who were known as Les Six. He was asked to write a symphonic drama which he called \"Socrate\". Many musicians think it is his best piece.\nFinal years.\nIn the 1920s he wrote many articles for newspapers and journals and became associated with the art movement known as Dada. His ballets \"Rel\u00e2che\" and \"Mercure\" both shocked the audiences when they were first performed. \"Rel\u00e2che\" is an early example of what later became the theatre of alienation.\nSatie drank a lot of alcohol and became ill. He got cirrhosis of the liver and died in 1925. When his friends entered his flat after he died, there was so much mess that they had to throw away two cartloads of rubbish before they could get at his papers and manuscripts.\nHis music.\nSatie was involved with dance, theatre and cabaret for most of his life and that is what much of his music is written for. He was always trying out new ideas in his music. He was capable of writing in a late Romantic style with chromatic harmonies, but he also wrote in more modern styles, often using very simple ideas. He was always more interested in beautiful melodies than in writing complicated rhythms. His three \"Gymnop\u00e9dies\" are still extremely popular. They seem to come from an old-fashioned world where there is great simplicity. His three \"Gnossiennes\" (1890) sound more Oriental, and Satie wrote some very strange remarks in the music. His piano piece \"Vexations\" (1893) is a short piece with strange, chromatic chords, which the pianist is then supposed to play 840 times. \"Uspud\" was an early example of what later became the \u201cTheatre of the Absurd\u201d. The text was all written in lower-case letters: the first time this had ever been done. He wrote many cabaret songs.\nLater, after he had studied at the Schola Cantorum, he became famous, and then wrote lots of piano pieces with funny titles and strange comments (e.g. \u201clike a nightingale with toothache\u201d). \"Parade\" has strange instruments such as typewriters. \"Socrate\" was his most serious work.\nAfter his death all the people he had insulted wrote about Satie that he was a bad composer. As a result he was almost forgotten until the 1960s when John Cage became interested in his music and made it popular again. Many Surrealist artists were often inspired by Satie\u2019s music and ideas."}

An early experimeter was the German miller Julius Hensel, author of \"Bread from Stones\", who reported successful results with \"steinmehl\" (stonemeal) in the 1890s.

It is quite near the sea, and near to a harbour for yachts.\nThe City of Chichester is twinned with:\nThere are many buildings in the centre of Chichester which have interesting architecture. The oldest building is Chichester Cathedral. There are many beautiful houses in the Cathedral precincts. In many parts of the city one can still see the old city walls, and it is possible to walk along the top in some places. There is an old butter market dating from 1808. A century later another storey was added on top.\nJust to the north of Chichester is the Goodwood race course. Many people go there in the summer to watch the horse races. Goodwood is in the South Downs which is a beautiful area for walking.\nChichester is an old Roman town. In the centre of Chichester are four main streets: North Street, South Street, East Street and West Street. These four streets meet in the centre, where there is a small round building with a cross: the Chichester cross. The four main streets form an area which is mostly pedestrianized. Chichester Cathedral stands near the centre, between West Street and South Street. Further to the north lies the area of Summersdale and the conservation area around Graylingwell Hospital. South of Chichester is a canal which links the city to the sea. Soon after it was built in the 19th century the railway came to Chichester so that the canal was not used for long. The canal was left in a bad state for many years until, more recently, it was restored. Some of it can be used by small boats, and there are reedbeds where birds can breed.\nThere is a Roman Museum near Fishbourne, just west of the city, where many Roman remains can be seen, including a palace which once stood there.\nChichester is a Fairtrade City. Suppliers of Fairtrade are shown by a green dot in the web directory.\nBecause Chichester is so historic it has been divided into eight conservation areas. People are very anxious that the town should not lose its historic character.\nCulture.\nEvery year in July, a three-week festival, the Chichester Festivities, takes place. Then in August since 2007 there has been a week long I AM JOY Arts and Music festival held across different venues in the city. The Chichester Festival Theatre has productions for most of the year. It is one of the most famous theatres outside London.\nPallant House Gallery won the 2007 gallery of the year Gulbenkian Prize. It has a lot of modern British art.\nThe Joy Gallery, open from December 2008 to November 2009, showcased emerging and established artists from the local area.\nChichester has its own amateur orchestra, the Chichester Symphony Orchestra, which gives three concerts during the year.\nChichester RAJF (From \"Real Ale and Jazz Festival\") gives a four-day festival of music and real ale held each July in tents beside the 13th century Guildhall in Priory Park.\nSport.\nThere is plenty of sport in Chichester. Chichester R.F.C. are a central team and rugby club. There is a large swimming pool with fitness rooms and sports hall. There are tennis courts near the Festival Theatre.\nEducation.\nChichester has several schools, including Chichester High School for Boys, Chichester High School for Girls, Bishop Luffa School and Prebendal School which is linked to the Cathedral. There is a University of Chichester which, until recently, was known as Bishop Otter College.\nTransport.\nSeveral roads lead into Chichester. The A27, which runs along the south coast, now bypasses the city. There are rail links to London, Gatwick, Portsmouth, Southampton and Basingstoke. Many years ago there was a small train which went to Midhurst, and even a tram to Selsey. Nowadays busses go to these towns. They depart from the central bus station near the railway station."}

The book did not only describe what Dunant saw, but called for the setting up of national voluntary relief organisations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war. Dunant also called for international treaties to guarantee the neutrality and protection for the wounded and for medics and field hospitals.\nThe Geneva Society for Public Welfare set up a committee to try to organise an international conference about Dunant's idea.

The convention contained ten articles, establishing for the first time legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, field medical personnel, and specific humanitarian institutions in an armed conflict.\nAlso, the convention had two requirements before a national relief society would be recognised by the International Committee:\nThe first national societies were founded in Belgium, Denmark, France, Oldenburg, Prussia, Spain, and W\u00fcrttemberg. Also in 1864, Louis Appia and Charles van de Velde, a captain of the Dutch Army, became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the Red Cross in an armed conflict. Three years later in 1867, the first International Conference of National Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded was convened.\nDunant left the committee in 1867 after arguing with other members. In 1876, the committee changed its name to the\"International Committee of the Red Cross\" (ICRC), which is still its official name today. Five years later, the American Red Cross was founded through the efforts of Clara Barton. More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts. The Red Cross quickly became an internationally respected movement, and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work.\nWhen the first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, the Norwegian Nobel Committee opted to give it to Henry Dunant and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy, a leading campaigner against war. The International Committee of the Red Cross officially congratulated Dunant and was a tribute to his key role in the formation of the Red Cross. Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of Heiden. Only two months earlier his former friend and committee member Gustave Moynier had also died.\nBy the start of the First World War in 1914, there were 45 national relief societies throughout the world. The movement had grown beyond Europe and North America to Central and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, El Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela), Asia (the Republic of China, Japan, Korea, Siam), and Africa (Republic of South Africa). The Geneva Convention had been changed to include fighting at sea as well as on land.\nWorld War One.\nIn World War I Red Cross nurses came from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to help the medical services of the armed forces of the countries involved in the war in Europe.\nOn 15 October 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War (POW) Agency. By the end of the war, the Agency had sent about 20 million letters and messages, 1.9 million parcels, and about 18 million Swiss francs to POWs of all affected countries. The Agency also arranged for about 200,000 prisoners to be released and returned to their home country. The Agency collected about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923 about prisoners or missing people. The card index helped to identify about 2 million POWs and to contact their families. The complete index of 7 million cards is on loan from the ICRC to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva. But only ICRC can search the index.\nThe ICRC got the only Nobel Peace Prize of the war years, in 1917, for its outstanding wartime work.\nIn 1923, the Committee changed its membership rules. Until then, only citizens of the city of Geneva could serve in the Committee. This was changed to include all citizens of Switzerland by birth. This is still the rule today, and is designed to show that the ICRC is neutral, and that committee members and workers have never been citizens of a country that might be involved in a war. Only in 1993 were non-Swiss-born people allowed to work for the committee.\nWorld War Two.\nIn 1934 the ICRC tried to get extra protection for civilians during war. Unfortunately most governments were not interested in adopting the extra rules before the start of World War II.\nThe Geneva Conventions, as amended in 1929, governed what the ICRC did. revision . The activities of the Committee were similar to those during World War I: \nBy the end of the war, 179 delegates had conducted 12,750 visits to POW camps in 41 countries. The Central Information Agency on Prisoners-of-War (\"Zentralauskunftsstelle f\u00fcr Kriegsgefangene\") had a staff of 3,000, the card index tracking prisoners contained 45 million cards (more than 6 times as many as world war 1), and 120 million messages were exchanged by the Agency.\nThe German Red Cross was controlled by the Nazis, and would not uphold the Geneva conventions which may have helped stop the deportation of Jews from Germany and the mass murders conducted in the concentration camps run by the German government.\nTwo other main countries in the war, the Soviet Union and Japan, were not party to the 1929 Geneva Conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions. Thus, other countries were not bound to follow the Conventions regarding their prisoners in return.\nThe ICRC had to stop complaining about the treatment of detainees in concentration camps in case the ICRC was stopped from working for POWs.\nAfter November 1943, the ICRC could send parcels to concentration camp detainees with known names and locations. Because the notices of receipt for these parcels were often signed by other inmates, the ICRC managed to register the identities of about 105,000 detainees in the concentration camps and delivered about 1.1 million parcels, mostly to the camps Dachau, Buchenwald, Ravensbr\u00fcck, and Sachsenhausen.\nOn 12 March 1945, ICRC president Jacob Burckhardt was told by SS General Ernst Kaltenbrunner that the ICRC's delegates could visit the concentration camps, but the delegates would have to stay in the camps until the end of the war. Ten delegates, among them Louis Haefliger (Camp Mauthausen), Paul Dunant (Camp Theresienstadt) and Victor Maurer (Camp Dachau), visited the camps.\nLouis Haefliger told American troops about the forceful eviction or blasting of Mauthausen-Gusen and saved the lives of about 60,000 inmates. His actions were condemned by the ICRC because they were deemed as acting unduly on his own authority and risking the ICRC's neutrality. Only in 1990, his reputation was finally rehabilitated by ICRC president Cornelio Sommaruga.\nAnother example of great humanitarian spirit was Friedrich Born (1903-1963), an ICRC delegate in Budapest who saved the lives of about 11,000 to 15,000 Jewish people in Hungary. Marcel Junod (1904-1961), a doctor from Geneva, was another famous delegate during the Second World War. He was one of the first foreigners to visit Hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped, and wrote his thoughts in his book \"Warrior without Weapons\".\nIn 1944, the ICRC got its third Nobel Peace Prize.\nAfter the Second World War.\nOn 12 August 1949, the existing two Geneva Conventions were changed, and the Hague Convention about casualties at sea was brought into the Geneva Convention \"family\". It was renamed the Second Geneva Covention, and so the second convention of 1929 is now called the third convention. The Fourth Geneva Convention, about the \"Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War,\" was established. On 8 June 1977 extra article \"protocols\" were added to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars.\nIn 1963, the ICRC shared its third Nobel Peace Prize with the League of Red Cross Societies.\nSince 1993, non-Swiss citizens have been allowed to serve as Committee delegates abroad, a task which was previously restricted to Swiss citizens. Now about one third of staff are not Swiss citizens.\nOn 16 October 1990, the UN General Assembly gave the ICRC observer status for its assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings, the first observer status given to a private organization. The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the Italian ambassador, Vieri Traxler, in memory of the organization's origins in the Battle of Solferino.\nAn agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993, affirmed the already long-standing policy of full independence of the Committee from any interference by Switzerland. The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.\nThe ICRC continued its activities throughout the 1990s. It broke its usual silence when it denounced the Rwandan Genocide in 1994, and again in 1995 about the crimes that happened in and around Srebrenica when it said, \"We must acknowledge that despite our efforts to help thousands of civilians forcibly expelled from the town and despite the dedication of our colleagues on the spot, the ICRC's impact on the unfolding of the tragedy was extremely limited.\" It went public once again in 2007 to decry \"major human rights abuses\" by Burma's military government including forced labor, starvation, and murder of men, women, and children.\nFatalities.\nAt the end of the Cold War, the ICRC's work actually became more dangerous. In the 1990s, more delegates lost their lives than at any point in its history, especially when working in local and internal armed conflicts. These incidents often demonstrated a lack of respect for the rules of the Geneva Conventions and their protection symbols. Among the slain delegates were:\nSymbols.\nThe original motto of the International Committee of the Red Cross was \"Inter Arma Caritas\" (\"Amidst War, Charity\"). It has preserved this motto while other Red Cross organizations have adopted others. Because Geneva is in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, the ICRC is also known under its French name \"Comit\u00e9 international de la Croix-Rouge\" (CICR). However, the ICRC has six official languages, including Arabic. The official symbol of the ICRC is the Red Cross on white background (the inverse of the Swiss flag)with the words \"COMITE INTERNATIONAL GENEVE\" circling the cross.\nThe ICRC drew up seven fundamental principles in 1965 that were adopted by the entire Red Cross Movement. They are \nFunding and financial matters.\nThe 2005 budget of the ICRC was about 970 million Swiss francs. All payments to the ICRC are voluntary and are received as donations based on two types of appeals issued by the Committee: an annual \"Headquarters Appeal\" to cover its internal costs and \"Emergency Appeals\" for its individual missions.\nMost of the ICRC's funding comes from Switzerland and the United States, with the other European states and the E.U. close behind. Together with Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, they contribute about 80-85% of the ICRC's budget. About 3% comes from private gifts, and the rest comes from national Red Cross societies.\nResponsibilities within the Movement.\nThe ICRC is responsible for legally recognizing a relief society as an official national Red Cross or Red Crescent society and thus accepting it into the Movement. The exact rules are in the statutes of the Movement. After recognition by the ICRC, a national society is admitted as a member to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. The ICRC and the Federation cooperate with the individual national societies in their international missions, especially with human, material, and financial resources and organizing on-site logistics. According to the 1997 Seville Agreement, the ICRC is the lead Red Cross agency in conflicts while other organizations within the Movement take the lead in non-war situations. National societies will be given the lead especially when a conflict is happening within their own country.\nOrganization.\nThe ICRC headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. It has other offices, called \"Delegations\", in about 80 countries. Each delegation is under the responsibility of a Head of delegation who is the official representative of the ICRC in the country. Of its 2,000 professional employees, roughly 800 work in its Geneva headquarters and 1,200 expatriates work in the field. About half of the field workers serve as delegates managing ICRC operations in the different countries while the other half are specialists like doctors, agronomists, engineers or interpreters. The international staff are assisted by some 13,000 national employees, so about 15,000 people work for the ICRC.\nDirectorate.\nThe Directorate is the executive body of the Committee.It carries out the policies set by the assembly.\nThe Directorate consists of a Director-General and five directors in the areas of \"Operations\", \"Human Resources\", \"Resources and Operational Support\", \"Communication\", and \"International Law and Cooperation within the Movement\". The members of the Directorate are appointed by the Assembly to serve for four years. The Director-General has assumed more personal responsibility in recent years, much like a CEO, where he was formerly more of a first among equals at the Directorate.\nAssembly.\nThe Assembly (also called the Committee) convenes on a regular basis and is responsible for defining aims, guidelines, and strategies and for supervising the financial matters of the Committee. The Assembly has a membership of a maximum of 25 Swiss citizens. Members must speak the house language of French, but many also speak English and German as well. These Assembly members are co-opted for a period of four years, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual member can serve. A three-quarters majority vote from all members is required for re-election after the third term, which acts as a motivation for members to remain active and productive.\nIn the early years, every Committee member was Genevan, Protestant, white, and male. The first woman, Ren\u00e9e-Marguerite Cramer, was co-opted in 1918. Since then, several women have attained the Vice Presidency, and the female proportion after the Cold War has been about 15%. The first non-Genevans were admitted in 1923, and one Jew has served in the Assembly.\nWhile the rest of the Red Cross Movement many be multi-national, the Committee believes that its mono-national nature is an asset because the nationality in question is Swiss. Thanks to permanent Swiss neutrality, conflicting parties can be sure that no one from \"the enemy\" will be setting policy in Geneva. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 showed that even National Red Cross Societies can be biased and not maintain neutral humanitarianism.\nAssembly Council.\nFurthermore, the Assembly elects a five-member Assembly Council that constitutes an especially active core of the Assembly. The Council meets at least ten times per year and has the authority to decide on behalf of the full Assembly in some matters. The Council is also responsible for organizing the Assembly meetings and for helping communication between the Assembly and the Directorate. The Assembly Council normally includes the president, two vice presidents and two elected members. While one of the vice presidents is elected for a four-year term, the other is appointed permanently with his tenure ending by retirement from the vice presidency or from the Committee. Currently Jacques Forster and Olivier Vodoz are vice presidents. In April 2007, Christine Beerli was appointed to succeed Jacques Forster from the beginning of 2008.\nThe President.\nThe Assembly also selects, for a term of four years, one individual to act as President of the ICRC. The president is both a member of the Assembly and leader of the ICRC, and he has always been included on the Council since its formation. The President automatically becomes a member of the assembly and the ICRC once he is appointed, but he does not necessarily come from within the ICRC organization. There is a strong faction within the Assembly that wants to reach outside the organization to select a president from the Swiss government or professional circles like the banking or medical fields. In fact, the last three presidents were previously officials in the Swiss government. The president's influence and role is not well-defined, and changes depending upon the times and each president's personal style. Since 2000, the president of the ICRC has been Jakob Kellenberger. Kellenberger does not make many public appearances or statements but is good at personal negotiation promoting the ICRC privately. In February 2007, he was appointed by the Assembly to another four-year term which will run until the end of 2011.\nThe presidents of the ICRC have been:\nThe ICRC tends to work quietly and not attract publicity, unlike some other aid agencies. This way it was been able to get access to, for example, Nelson Mandela, when he was still a prisoner of the apartheid government of South Africa."}

She learned a lot about sickness and medicine and how to cure and nurse sick people, and often helped people she knew when they were sick. \nCareer.\nWhen she was an adult, she moved to Stockholm and became a maid.

They make people sleep and wake at times that are not normal, but these people usually have 8 hours of good sleep. These disorders affect other systems in the body, too, and not just sleep. Circadian rhythms also control appetite, body temperature rhythm and hormone cycles.\nExtrinsic category.\n\"Extrinsic\" means something which comes from outside rather than from within a system or an organism. There are two circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the extrinsic type:\nJet Lag often affects people who have travelled several hours east or west, through several time zones. It may take many days for the body to adjust. The name \"jet lag\" comes from travelling by jet aircraft.\nMany people have health problems when they work a shift during the times when their circadian rhythms say that they should be asleep. Most people who work later than midnight find it difficult to stay awake.\nIntrinsic category.\n\"Intrinsic\" means something which happens or comes from within a system or an organism. There are four circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the intrinsic type. Unless they are caused by a head injury, they are usually genetic, that is, people are born with them. They are generally chronic; they do not go away, but they may sometimes be treated.\nAdvanced sleep-phase syndrome (ASPS) is very rare. People with this syndrome are sleepy very early in the evening and they sleep from about 19:00-20:00 in the evening to about 03:00-04:00 in the early morning. Often several people in the same family have ASPS.\nDelayed sleep-phase syndrome (DSPS) is more common than ASPS and it affects about 0.15% of adults. It usually starts in early childhood or at puberty. Some cases that start at puberty go away when the person is about 20 or 21 years old. DSPS is much more common in teenagers than in adults. DSPS in people older than about 20 usually will have it all their lives, that is, it is chronic.\nPeople with DSPS cannot go to sleep before 03:00-06:00 in the morning, or even later. They cannot wake up in time for school or a job which starts in the morning. They can go to sleep at the same time every night and get up at the same time each day. This means that they are \"entrained\" (adjusted, synchronized) to the daily light/dark cycle. Even when they try to sleep at \"normal\" times, they feel most awake late at night.\nNon-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome (Non-24) is quite rare. People with Non-24 have very unusual sleep timing. Their sleep and wake times are not regulated by daylight; they are not \"entrained\" (adjusted, synchronized) to the daily light/dark cycle. This is called freerunning sleep.\nThe worst circadian rhythm sleep disorder in people who can see is Non-24; their \"daily\" rhythm lasts 25 hours or more so they sleep and wake up one or more hours later each day. Appetite, body temperature rhythm and hormone cycles all keep moving around the clock, coming back to the same time after a few weeks.\nAbout half of totally blind people, who can see no light at all, have Non-24. Their daily rhythm is not exactly 24 hours and it does not adjust to the light/dark cycle in nature because they can not see light. This can often be treated.\nIrregular sleep-wake disorder is rare, and it is often possible to find out what causes it, for example, a head injury, a mental handicap, dementia or some other sicknesses. People with this disorder sleep and wake several times a day, but not at the same times every day. They sleep about 8 hours a day but never 8 hours together.\nTreatment.\nTreatment for these disorders often does not work well. In addition, it can be difficult to find a doctor who knows much about circadian rhythms, as the field of study is quite new.\nTreatment with bright light is also called phototherapy or light therapy. People with ASPS need a lot of light in the evening and they should avoid bright light in the morning. People with DSPS need bright light as soon as they wake up and should try to avoid bright light before bedtime.\nMelatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland in the brain. It is normally only produced in the evening and at night. People with ASPS can take melatonin by mouth in the morning. People with DSPS can take melatonin in the afternoon or evening, and this treatment works also for some people with Non-24.\nOne can buy melatonin in the shops in the USA and Canada. In most other countries one must get it from a doctor or it might not be legal at all."}

The spoken language in the city is called Herati Persian or just Herati.\nHistory.\nHerat dates back to very old times. Avesta, the old book of Zoroastrianism mentions Herat as \"Haroyu\" and lists it as the sixth land of the sixteen perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In Achaemenid times (ca. 550-330 BC), the surrounding district was known as \"Haraiva\" (in Old Persian). Ancient Greeks called it \"Aria\" and \"Artacoana\" was the capital of Aria. Alexander the Great took Artacoana in 330 BC and destroyed it. He later built another city near Artacoana and named it \"Alexandria in Ariana\", today's city of Herat. After him Parthians and Sassanians took over. Sassanians called the city \u201cHar\u0113v\u201d.\nArabs took Herat in 660 AD, and it became a center of the Muslim world. Herat has a long history as a centre for Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. It became part of the area then known as Khurasan, which reached its peak of civilization in the twelfth century. In 1221 AD, it was taken by the Mongols and later destroyed by Genghis Khan and Timur, the Turkic conqueror, took it in about 1393 AD. Herat\u2019s greatest era was during the Timurid rule, when it was a centre of science and culture. As the capital of the Timurid empire, it boasted many fine religious buildings and was famous for its sumptuous court life and musical performance and its tradition of miniature paintings. Later Persians and Afghans fought over the control of the city and Herat changed hands several times before it (under British interference) permanently became part of Afghanistan in 1857 under the Treaty of Paris.\nIn March 1979, an anti-Communist uprising in Herat, left 25,000 civilian deaths. Between 1978 and 1992, communist forces in Herat city fought resistance forces holding the countryside. In 1995 the area came under the control of Pashtuns of the Taliban movement. After the United States' invasion of Afghanistan, on November 12, 2001, it was liberated from the Taliban by the Northern Alliance."}

{"id": "79623", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79623", "title": "Borat Sagdiyev", "text": "Borat Sagdiyev (Kazakh and Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0421\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432) is a fictional Kazakh journalist, created and portrayed by the English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen.\nHumor is often derived from Borat being a foreigner and having strange customs, thoughts, and behavior. There is also a lot of toilet humor in the series. Borat hates Gypsies and is also Anti-Semitic.\nOrigins of Borat.\nThe Borat character first appeared in short clips on \"F2F - The Granada Talk TV Show\" that Sacha Baron Cohen presented in 1996-1997.\nBorat's life and family.\nBorat was born in the fictional village of Kuzcek, Kazakhstan to Asimbala Sagdiyev and Boltok the town rapist (who is also his mother's father). He has a 13-year-old son named Hooeylewis and 12-year-old twin boys named Biram and Bilak, as well as 17 grandchildren. He has an older sister named Natalya (whom he has claimed at different times to be either \"the number four\" or \"number two prostitute\" in Kazakhstan) and a younger brother, Bilo, who is mentally retarded. It is revealed that he has a second wife in addition to a mistress, a girlfriend and a prostitute.\nBorat is shown to have been married several times, after first having been betrothed to his half-sister's plough while in his teens. His first wife Oksana was reported in the \"Borat\" movie to have been \"broken\" by a bear while taking his brother Bilo for a walk in the forest. The death of Borat's wife did not bother him; he thanks the man who brings him this \"good news\" \u2014 and celebrates by trying to marry Pamela Anderson and eventually reuniting with Luenell, a black prostitute he met while filming his documentary.\nBorat is a professional journalist and announcer on Kazakh television. According to various in-character interviews with Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat learned at Astana University, where he studied English, journalism, and plague research. He claims to have created five new plagues which supposedly \"killed over 5 million goats and whores in Uzbekistan.\"\nBefore this Borat was an ice maker, animal sperm retriever, gypsy catcher, and someone who removes dead birds from a computer.\nBorat was a pagan for most of his life. However, in the movie he attends a Pentecostal church service and later converts his village neighbors to Christianity.\nBorat greatly admires Joseph Stalin, and claims that both he and Stalin are strong men with powerful \"khram\" (genitals). He hates women's rights and was surprised to learn that women can vote in some countries. In his spare time, he enjoys playing ping pong, sunbathing while wearing a lime green \"mankini\", disco dancing, spitting, sitting on comfortable chairs, and taking pictures of women while they \"make toilet\".\n\"Da Ali G Show\".\nBorat is shown in each episode of \"Da Ali G Show\", doing funny interviews with real people in the United Kingdom and the United States. The segments were shot in low-quality video to make fun of how poor Kazakhstan is and how it cannot afford good cameras. Of Ali G, Borat comments on his website, \"I appear on Alee G shows\u2013He idiot, but it give me lot of girls &amp; pickles; I like...\"\nThe Borat segments on \"Da Ali G Show\" use a rock and roll version of the Russian folk tune \"Korobeiniki\" as the theme song.\nGuide to Britain.\nWas part of a six-part Ali G show originally on Channel 4 (UK) in March 2000.\nFive Borat sketches were shown: \"Etiquette\", Hunting, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Henley. The \"Guides\" to \"English Gentlemen\", \"Politics\" and \"Sport\" were also filmed at this time but released later as part of \"Ali G\" DVDs.\nBorat Special.\nA special shown on the E4 launch night (UK) in January 2001 known as \"The Best of Borat.\"\nSome of the best parts were the \"Guide to Sport\" and a some video of Borat's village in Kazakhstan. Though the village they used was really in Romania.\nGuide to USA 1.\nShown as part of a six part \"Ali G Show\" originally on HBO (USA) in February 2003.\nSix Borat sketches were shown in the form of \"Guides\" to \"Dating,\" \"Etiquette,\" \"Acting,\" \"Men,\" \"Baseballs,\" and \"The (Deep) South.\" A \"Guide to Animals\" was filmed, but released at a later date as part of an \"Ali G\" DVD. Alyssa Greenfill was also in it.\nGuide to USA 2.\nShown as part of a six-part \"Ali G Show\" originally on HBO (USA) in July 2004. (C4 was the UK channel where Ali G and Borat originally appeared, and the series for America was a HBO/C4 co-production).\nSix Borat sketches were shown: \"Wine Tasting\", \"Politics\", \"Country Music\", \"Hobbies\", \"Buying a House\" and \"Jobs\" (careers). A \"Guide to Hunting\" was filmed but only aired in the UK because it bothered animal rights people in America.\nAli G Indahouse.\nBorat appeared in the Ali G movie \"Ali G Indahouse\" as a Kazak diplomat. Borat greets Ali G with a hug and kiss, but Ali pushes him away. Borat then calls Ali a \"cocksucker\". In the end, Borat performs a hip-hop song with superstar Max Allard.\nThe \"Movie Film\".\nSubtitled \"Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\", the movie \"Borat\" is mockumentary comedy. Most of those appearing in the film are not paid performers, but real people whom Borat met on his journey. The movie was distributed by 20th Century Fox, and directed by Larry Charles. It premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released across Europe and North America on November 3, 2006.\nThe film follows Borat in his travels across the United States as he commits cultural solecisms and exposes a few American ones. Over the course of the film, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson after watching a rerun of \"Baywatch\" and vows to make her his wife.\nThe film opened at # 1 in the United States, taking in $26.4 million on a limited release of 837 screens during its first weekend, beating \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" as the biggest opening weekend for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas. Cohen celebrated the release of the movie with a host of promotional 'in-character' interviews.\nOn November 9, 2006, the Russian Federal Agency for Culture and Cinematography issued an opinion, citing \"it could offend viewers in relation to certain ethnic groups and religions.\"\nThe movie expanded its release on the second weekend to 2,566 screens, where it took in an additional $29 million.\nIn 2007, Baron Cohen won a Golden Globe for \"Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical Or Comedy.\"\nWith a production budget of $18,000,000, the movie earned $128,501,044 in the United States and another $128,848,505 in the rest of the world. $257,349,549 in total as of March 2007.\nBook.\nIn 2007, a book from Cohen was released entitled, \"Touristic Guidings to Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan/ Touristic Guidings to Minor Nation of U.S. and A.\", with humor about both countries in the same style as movie.\nLanguage.\nThough he pretends to speak Kazakh, Borat really speaks in Hebrew mixed with some Polish and other Slavic language phrases, such as \" and \" (Polish \"how are you\" and \"thank you\"). As such, the film became popular in Israel.\nBorat also lapses into Hebrew while purporting to sing the Kazakhstani national anthem at a Savannah Sand Gnats game. He kept repeating a famous Hebrew folk song: (; kum bachur atzel ve'tze la'avoda; \"get up lazy guy and go to work [...]\" ) [...] ; kookooriku kookooriku ha'tarnegol kara; \"cock-a-doodle-do the cock has crowed\"), and also called Kazakhstan a distant/desolate place (literally \"hole\" ()(\"hor\")).\nHis producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) speaks Armenian, while his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) speaks Bulgarian\nIn the opening scenes in the town of Kuzcek, the villagers speak Romanian because these scenes were shot in Glod, Romania. As in the rest of the movie, what is spoken does not match the translation given in the subtitles. For example, when Borat's wife Oksana speaks, the subtitles show her telling Borat to \"do something useful and dig his mother's grave,\" when she is actually telling him to go into \"the devil's cunt.\"\nCriticism and controversy.\nCriticized as unfair smear against Kazakhstan.\nSome say that Kazakhstan is not as bad as Borat says it is and that it is wrong of him to say such things.\nIn August 2004, the Chief Rabbi of Kazakhstan, at an international religious meeting in Brussels, stated that in 10 years in the country, he had never faced anti-Semitism. He praised the Government of Kazakhstan for its treatment of the Jewish community.\nOn October 19, the Associated Press reported that Kazakhstan's Deputy Foreign Minister, Rakhat Aliyev, had invited Cohen to visit Kazakhstan to see how wrong he was about it. In an interview, Aliyev asserted that:\nHis trip could yield a lot of discoveries\u2014that women not only travel inside buses but also drive their own cars, that we make wine from grapes, that Jews can freely attend synagogues and so on.\nDenigration of Gypsies.\nBorat's film has frequently been accused of promoting antiziganism. The scenes supposedly filmed in Borat's Kazakhstani village were actually filmed in an impoverished Roma (gipsy) village of Glod in Romania. \"USA Today\" reports that poverty villagers were offered between $3.30 and $5.50 to bring animals into their houses and perform other acts some critics called humiliating. The studio contends that\nparticipants were paid double the rate recommended by the Romanian movie office for extras.\nTwo villagers of Glod have hired reparation attorney Ed Fagan to sue the makers of the film for $30 million for human rights abuses. Fagan intends to submit lawsuits in New York and Florida state courts, as well as in Frankfurt, Germany. Fagan said that he hoped to \"teach Hollywood a very expensive lesson.\" The lawsuit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in a hearing in early December 2006 on the ground that the charges were too vague to stand up in court. Fagan plans to refile.\nDenigration of Jews.\nThe Borat character has elicited some controversy, mostly related to his frequent displays of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.\nBaron Cohen, who is himself Jewish, has explained his character's racism by stating that the segments show how people are sometimes racist because others around them are too and that it is important to stand up against racism.\n \"Borat essentially works a tool. By himself pretending to be anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice,\" Cohen explains to \"Rolling Stone\".&lt;ref name=\"finally_speaks/page/2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, says he wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference:\nWhen I was in university, there was this major historian of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw, who said, 'The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be apathetic.\nRegarding the enthusiastic response to his song \"In My Country There is Problem\" (detailed below), he says, \"Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism.\"\nHowever, the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based group that \u201c...combat[s] anti-Semitism and bigotry of all kinds\u201d, complained to HBO after Borat performed a country western song titled \"In My Country There Is Problem\" that called on people to 'throw the Jew down the well', warning them that 'you must be careful of his teeth' and that 'you must grab him by his horns', to applause and joining in from some of the audience in Tucson, Arizona. The chorus goes: \"Throw the Jew down the well/So my country can be free/You must grab him by his horns/Then we have a big party.\"\nIn another scene, Borat visits the Serengeti Range ranch in Texas, where the owner of the ranch confides that he believes the Holocaust was a necessity for Germany. He further implies that he would have no problem running a ranch where people can hunt, in Borat's words, \"deer... then Jew.\"\nAn interview with James Broadwater, an evangelical Christian and Republican candidate for U.S. Congress from Mississippi, caused Broadwater to receive some hateful emails after an episode of \"Da Ali G Show\" aired in which Broadwater stated that Jews will go to Hell. He was told that the interview would be played in foreign countries to teach others about the American political system. Broadwater later posted a letter on his website against \"Da Ali G Show,\" explaining that his statement referred to a theological belief that anyone that \"accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour will spend eternity in Heaven, while everyone who rejects Him will spend eternity in Hell.\" Broadwater did not apologise for his comments. Instead, he insisted that \"the liberal, anti-God media needs to be brought under the strict control of the FCC, and that as soon as possible.\"\nIn the movie, Borat continues to hate Jews and be fearful of them. He does not like to fly while in America in case the Jews \"make another 9/11\". Later, as he finds himself in a hotel run by an old Jewish couple, he tries to \"escape\" and throws money at two bugs on the floor, afraid that the Jews have shapeshifted into cockroaches.\nCohen later joked, upon receiving a British comedy award, that Borat was guest of honour at the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Tehran.\nIraq war sarcasm.\nIn January 2005, after pretending to be making a documentary, Cohen angered a crowd at a rodeo in Salem, Virginia. The crowd first cheered his statements of \"support\" for the Iraq war, including statements like \"We is support your war of terror\", and \"May George Bush drink the blood of every single man, woman, and child of Iraq\". However, the applause softened when he exclaimed \"May you destroy their country so that for the next thousand years, not even a single lizard will survive in their desert!\" The crowd then got infuriated when he sang the (fictional) Kazakhstan national anthem to an off-key version of the US national anthem.\n\"If he had been out there a minute longer, I think somebody would have shot him,\" said one witness. \"People were booing him, flipping him off.\" For his own safety, Cohen was escorted from the venue. (Much of the event appears in the movie. A credulous news report about the incident, aired on a local television station, is included in the DVD extras).\nControversy with Kazakhstan's government.\nBaron Cohen has also been accused of creating a derogatory image of Kazakhstan.\nIn November 2005, following Borat's hosting of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon, Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry said he was worried about the character. Spokesman Yerzhan Ashykbayev told a news conference: \"We view Mr Cohen's behaviour at the MTV Europe Music Awards as utterly unacceptable, being a concoction of bad taste and ill manners which is completely incompatible with the ethics and civilised behaviour of Kazakhstan's people\", concluding \"We reserve the right to any legal action to prevent new pranks of the kind.\"\nBaron Cohen has since posted a video on the \"Official Borat Homesite\" where Borat responds to Ashykbayev in character. In the video, Borat states, in part:\nIn response to Mr. Ashykbayev's comments, I'd like to state I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government's decision to sue this Jew. Since the 2003 Tuleyakiv reforms, Kazakhstan is as civilized as any other country in the world. Women can now travel on \"inside\" of bus, homosexuals no longer have to wear blue hats, and age of consent has been raised to eight years old. Please, captain of industry; I invite you to come to Kazakhstan where we have incredible natural resources, hardworking labour, and some of the cleanest prostitutes in whole of Central Asia. Goodbye! Dzienkuje!\nReuters quoted an unnamed Western diplomat as saying, \"They (the Government of Kazakhstan) are damned if they do [respond] and damned if they don't,\" he said. \"It's sort of unfortunate that he hit upon Kazakhstan.\" Another unnamed source inside Kazakhstan's Washington embassy called Borat a \"one-man diplomatic wrecking ball.\"\nThe next week, the government hired two Western public relations firms to counter Borat's claims, and ran a four-page advertisement in \"The New York Times\". The ad carried testimonials about the nation's democracy, education system and the power and influence enjoyed by women. On a previous occasion, Borat responded to such official complaints by issuing his own \"press release\", a bunch of random Cyrillic characters. He would again respond when promoting his movie in front of the Kazakhstani Embassy in Washington, roundly denouncing the advertisements as \"Uzbek propaganda\".\nOn December 13, 2005, the right to use the domain name www.borat.kz was suspended, and the site attached to it was closed down. The domain-issuing body said that they took this action since false names were given for the site's administrators, and also because the site www.borat.kz was hosted outside Kazakhstan. However, the stated underlying cause of the action was in order to censor the content of the site: \"We've done this so he can't badmouth Kazakhstan under the .kz domain name,\" Nurlan Isin, President of the Association of Kazakh IT Companies, told Reuters. \"He can go and do whatever he wants at other domains.\"\nReporters Without Borders petitioned the ICANN ombudsman to allow Borat to keep the website. Meanwhile, the \"Official Borat Homesite\" was moved to the .tv domain, where it remains. As of October 14, 2007, the former domain name was still suspended. The 2006 annual human rights report released by the US State Department cited the loss of the .kz website as evidence of the Kazakhstani government's efforts to stop free speech.\nBorat has, however, recently been defended by Dariga Nazarbayeva, a politician and daughter of Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev. She stated on a national news programme \"Karavan\" that Cohen's website \"damaged our image much less than its closure, which was covered by all global news agencies,\" and \"We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything, I think.\"\nWhite House \"visit\".\nOn September 28, 2006, Cohen appeared in character as Borat at the White House gates to give a press conference and invite \"Supreme Warlord Premier George Walker Bush\" to a screening of his forthcoming movie, along with \"O.J. Simpson\", \"Melvin Gibsons\" and other \"American dignitaries\", after which they would join him for drinks at Hooters. Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers would not admit him on to the grounds.\nComplaint by Gypsies in Germany.\nOn October 18, 2006, European Centre for Antiziganism Research, which pleads against discrimination of Gypsies, filed a complaint with prosecutors based on Borat's comments about Gypsies in his movie. The complaint accuses him of spreading lies and inciting violence against the ethnic group.\nAvian Flu \"Gift\".\nAt a press conference just hours before the live broadcast of the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards, he shocked local and international journalists in Lisbon, Portugal, by bringing a bag of birds from Romania (the first European country to detect avian influenza) as a gift, then proceeded to apologize for them all dying.\nVictims of Borat hoaxes.\nWAPT (Jackson, Mississippi) TV news producer Dharma Arthur states in \"Newsweek\" she lost her job as a result of her booking Borat on a local afternoon news program. At the time of the appearance, she was unaware of Cohen's act. During an interview with anchor Brad McMullan, Borat made sexual and scatological references, kissed McMullan, and later disrupted a live weather report. She said: \"Because of him, my boss lost faith in my abilities and second-guessed everything I did... I spiralled into depression, and... was released from my contract... It took me three months to find another job, and now I'm thousands of dollars in debt and struggling to keep my house out of foreclosure... How upsetting that a man who leaves so much harm in his path is lauded as a comedic genius.\"\nThe broadcast, including the initial interview, the disrupted weather report, and several behind-the-scenes shots made by Borat's own movie crew, is seen in the \"Borat\" movie.\nNot all hoax victims threaten to sue, however. Behind-the-scenes interviews with Randall Shelley (\"Guide to Baseball\"), Danny Passmore (\"Guide to Hobbies USA\"), Jennifer Defrancisco / Charles Di Cagno (\"Guide to Acting\"), Ken Goldberg (\"Guide to Being a Real Man\"), and Peta Heskell (\"Guide to English Gentlemen\") have all resulted in the subjects deciding not to sue."}

It was also during his term in Westminster that Pope John Paul II made first ever visit of a pope to England.\nIn 1998, Hume asked John Paul II for permission to retire, so that he could go back to his monastery at Ampleforth and spend some time fly fishing and watching Newcastle United Football Club. The request was refused.\nHe was diagnosed with inoperable abdominal cancer in April 1999. On 2 June of that same year, Queen Elizabeth awarded him the Order of Merit. He died just over two weeks later in London, at age 76. His funeral was broadcast live on British national television and he was buried in Westminster Cathedral. John Paul II said he was a \"shepherd of great spiritual and moral character\"."}

It is named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology.\nProteus was found from the images taken by \"Voyager 2\" probe during the Neptune flyby in 1989. It got the designation S/1989\u00a0N\u00a01. Stephen P. Synnott and Bradford A. Smith said (IAUC 4806) its discovery on July 7, 1989, speaking only of \u201c17 frames taken over 21 days\u201d, which gives a discovery date of sometime before June 16. The name was given on 16 September 1991.\nProteus is more than 400 kilometres in diameter, bigger than Nereid, another moon of Neptune. However, it was not found by Earth-based telescopes because it is so close to the planet that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight.\nProteus is one of the darkest objects in the solar system. Like Saturn's moon Phoebe, it reflects only 6 percent of the sunlight that hits it. Proteus is very cratered, showing no sign of any geological changes. It is also not a sphere; scientists believe Proteus is about as big as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has much more spherical shape despite being less massive than Proteus."}

It is named after the Nereids, sea-nymphs of Greek mythology.\nIt was the farthest of Neptune's known moons for a long time (Halimede through Neso have since taken that honour), and is the third biggest, with a diameter of 340\u00a0km. Its orbit averages 5,513,400\u00a0km in radius, but is very eccentric and varies from 1,353,600 to 9,623,700 kilometres. For a long time this was the most highly eccentric orbit of any known moon in the solar system, but Bestla, a more recently discovered moon of Saturn has a more eccentric orbit. The unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured asteroid or Kuiper belt object, or possibly that it was perturbed during the capture of Neptune's largest moon Triton. Very little else is known of Nereid.\nNereid was too far to be properly imaged by the \"Voyager 2\" probe when it visited the Neptune system in 1989. Photos sent back show only its very non-spherical shape, and no surface features could be seen at the resolution available."}

They live in large groups, mostly in rain forests.\nDescription.\nMales have an orange/yellow beard and an unmistakable bright red and blue snout and rump. Females and juveniles have a duller blue snout and a buff beard. Mandrills can live up to 40 years in captivity. They feed on fruits, leaves, roots, seeds, nuts, greens and invertebrates.\nHabitat.\nMandrills live in Cameroon, Gabon and the Congo. They live in dense rainforest and coastal forests, although they sometimes go onto the savannah. Mandrills live on the ground and in trees.\nBehaviour.\nMandrills seem to live in large, stable groups called \"hordes\". Hordes often number in the hundreds, possibly averaging around 600+ individuals and reaching as many as 845. It is difficult to accurately estimate group size in the forest, but filming a group crossing a gap between two forest patches or crossing a road is a reliable way of estimating group size. The largest group verifiably observed in this way contained over 1,300 individuals, in Lop\u00e9 National Park, Gabon\u2014the largest aggregation of nonhuman primates ever recorded. These groups are made of adult females and their dependent offspring. \nMales live a solitary lifestyle, and only enter hordes when females are ready for mating, which lasts three months each year.

It is the largest university in the state of Saxony and one of the ten largest universities in Germany with around 35,000 students.\nHistory.\nDresden University is one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany. In 1828, the Saxon Technical School was founded to teach workers in technological subjects such as mechanics and ship construction. In 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic, and other subjects, such as history and languages, were introduced. By the end of the 19th century the institute had grown into a university covering all subjects. It was given its current name in 1961.\nOrganisation.\nThe Dresden University of Technology is organised into 14 departments. Almost all departments are on the main campus south of the city centre, except for the Faculty of Medicine which has its own campus near the Elbe River, east of the city centre, and the Department of Forestry in a town nearby called Tharandt.\nThe university's annual budget is around \u20ac400 million.\nReputation.\nThe TU Dresden offers a wide range of courses and research. It has a high reputation in technical fields such as electrical engineering or computer science.\nThe university also has a strong research tradition in microelectronics and transport sciences in the Dresden area, and now is becoming more important in new fields of research such as biotechnology.\nCampus.\nTU Dresden is a campus university, meaning most of its buildings are in one area rather than being spread out across the city. Some of its buildings are more than a hundred years old. In recent years these historic building have been complemented by modern buildings (e.g. the library, the main auditorium, the biochemistry department or the life sciences building).\nStudents.\nAbout 60% of the students come from Saxony (about three-quarters live in Dresden), 19% from other eastern German states, 12% from the western German states and 10% from other countries.\nIn 2005/2006, there were 3,442 international students enrolled at TU Dresden. Most of the foreign students come from Europe (1,527), followed by Asia (1,404) and America (170). Ranked by countries the largest group of students comes from China (710), followed by Poland (294), Vietnam (196), Bulgaria (160) and Russia (154). The university is also quite popular among Central and East European countries such as the neighbouring Czech Republic (which is only away or Ukraine.\nBecause of the Erasmus programme and partnerships with universities in the United States, there are many English-, French- and Spanish-speaking students. But the language spoken during lessons is nearly always German. To prepare for the university, many international students attend German language courses at the university.\nOther activities.\nSports are very popular among the TUD students. There are eight big students' clubs and the summer campus party is among the biggest in Germany. There are cafeterias as at most universities and the largest refectory can compete with some restaurants even as far as menu size."}

It was a very short-lived storm over the north-central Atlantic Ocean. The storm lasted less than 48 hours, half of that time as a subtropical cyclone. It was never a threat to land.\nStorm history.\nThe system that would later become Tropical Storm Jerry started as a non-tropical low pressure area over the central Atlantic Ocean on September 21. The system moved in a shaky path over the north-central Atlantic over the next two days. It slowly developed deeper convection and became more organized. On September 22, the system had become organized enough that the National Hurricane Center mentioned a possible tropical or subtropical development in the area. Late that evening, it had been determined that a subtropical depression had formed, as a warm core had developed but the system was still involved with an upper-level low and had its strongest winds well removed from the center. Early on September 23, both satellite estimates and QuikScat data determined that the depression had strengthened into Subtropical Storm Jerry, despite the lack of a well-defined inner core. The storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics including a better-defined warm core, and became fully tropical that evening as a weak and sheared tropical storm with 40 mph (65 km/h) winds over a small radius.\nJerry began to weaken once again early on September 24 as it accelerated northeastward over cooler waters with sea surface temperatures below 24\u00b0C (75\u00b0F). It remained a tropical storm until later that morning.Then it weakened to a tropical depression ahead of a powerful cold front with little deep convection remaining in the system. Jerry remained a tropical depression as the cold front approached and began to absorb the system that afternoon as it continued to accelerate northeastward. That evening, a QuikScat pass determined that Jerry had opened up into a trough which was being absorbed into the larger frontal system. It completely dissipated by early on September 25.\nImpact.\nJerry never came near land during its lifespan, and no damage or deaths were reported. No ships were impacted by Jerry."}

It was the ninth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm developed as Tropical Depression Eight. Tropical Depression Nine appeared at the same time as Eight but was much quicker to develop. Tropical Depression Nine strengthened into Humberto\u2013the next name on the list\u2013before Eight became a named storm. Tropical Storm Ingrid was a weak storm. It only lasted for a short amount of time. The storm got weaker in the Atlantic because of high wind shear. Ingrid died out before reaching land areas. There was rain in Saint Martin and Antigua because of the storm.\nStorm history.\nThe system formed from a big tropical wave that moved off the coast of west Africa on September 6. Because of strong wind shear, it did not get stronger over the next three days. On September 9, it developed an area of low pressure in the central Atlantic, between the coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Slowly, the wind shear began to go away. Dvorak classifications were started on the weather system on September 11. By the morning of September 12, it had developed into Tropical Depression Eight. This took place about east of the Lesser Antilles. The same tropical wave eventually created another area of weather activity that became Tropical Depression Ten, with the help of other weather systems.\nThe system moved towards the west-northwest for almost all of its life. It stayed on the southern edge of a meteorological ridge. Wind shear slowed down development greatly. The system stayed a tropical depression for 24\u00a0hours before convection increased. The storm became a weak tropical storm early on September 13. The storm kept getting stronger that afternoon. It reached its highest strength of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) that evening.\nThe storm did not get stronger because of a very strong wind shear from a strong tropical upper tropospheric trough. Despite the high shear, Ingrid remained a weak tropical storm until the afternoon of September 15. It then weakened to a tropical depression while east of the Leeward Islands. Ingrid kept getting weaker as it passed to the northeast of the islands. The system stayed a tropical depression, because it continued to create strong thunderstorms. Ingrid became more organized for a short time on September 16. This event was short-lived. The storm became very disorganized once again that afternoon. It kept getting weaker. The final National Hurricane Center advisory was given out early on September 17 as the system weakened into a tropical wave while remaining north of the Leeward Islands. The remnant low turned to the northwest within the low-level steering flow. It died out on September 18 without any reforming.\nImpact.\nIngrid stayed just to the east and northeast of the Lesser Antilles. It weakened without impacting any land. Its remnants produced rain and thunder to Antigua. On Saint Martin, the system produced of rain in about an hour. This caused some roads to become flooded. No damage or deaths were caused by the storm. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds.\nBecause there was no damage from Tropical Storm Ingrid, the name \"Ingrid\" was not removed from the tropical cyclone names list, and will be used again during for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. This was the first time that the name \"Ingrid\" was used for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. However, the name has been used in other parts of the world."}

TUTTs are different from mid-latitude troughs in the sense that they are maintained by subsidence warming near the tropopause which balances radiation cooling.\nTUTTs sometimes bring a large amount of vertical wind shear over tropical disturbances and cyclones so TUTTs can reduce cyclone development. But, there are also times when TUTTs help start tropical cyclones or make them stronger by providing additional forced ascent near the storm center and an efficient outflow channel in the upper troposphere.

{"id": "79881", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79881", "title": "Tropical Storm Melissa (2007)", "text": "Tropical Storm Melissa was the thirteenth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was a short-lived storm that formed southwest of the Cape Verde islands, remaining weak because of high wind shear. It dissipated without affecting any land areas. It was only notable for being the eighth named storm of September 2007, which tied the record for the month of September.\nStorm history.\nThe system began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 26. An area of low pressure formed on September 27 near Cape Verde in association with the wave, and convection slowly increased as a result of the low. Early on September 28, a rapid increase in convection and a well-organized outflow pattern allowed the low to develop into Tropical Depression Fourteen while about 115 miles (185\u00a0km) west-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands. Since the depression was far removed from the subtropical ridge and an upper-level low pressure area was sitting to the north, steering currents were weak at first and the depression moved very slowly on a general west-northwest track. Vertical wind shear from the west also slowed down development. Small amounts of strengthening took place early on September 29 as convection increased in the system, and the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Melissa.\nLike previous storms Ingrid and Karen, high wind shear in the deep tropics delayed Melissa's development. Operationally, Melissa was briefly upgraded to 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h) late on September 29 as some satellite estimates showed a slightly stronger storm with deeper convection, but Melissa was found to have been weaker in the post-storm analysis, remaining at 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). By early on September 30, wind shear began to severely increase and a weakening trend began. That morning, the increased shear, combined with cooler sea surface temperatures, weakened Melissa to a tropical depression with a poorly-defined surface center as it continued to move west-northwest at a somewhat faster speed. The system lost its deep convection and by the afternoon of September 30, Melissa degenerated into a remnant low as thunderstorm activity decreased. After the circulation dissipated, the remnant low continued its general west-northwest track south of a rebuilding subtropical ridge in the central Atlantic. The low produced discontinuous amounts convection until it was absorbed by a frontal zone late on October 5 northeast of the Leeward Islands.\nImpact and records.\nMelissa remained away from land during its lifespan, never threatening any land areas. There were no ship reports of tropical storm-force winds as a result of Melissa. No damage or deaths were reported.\nWhen Tropical Depression Fourteen was upgraded to Tropical Storm Melissa on September 29, it was the eighth named storm to form in the month of September. That tied a record for the month of September, which was first set in the 2002 season."}

In this, Mario dies ten seconds into the final level.\nMusic.\nThe music was made by Hirokazu \"Hip\" Tanaka. Several remixes have been made of music from this game and used in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\".\nDevelopment.\nShigeru Miyamoto made \"Donkey Kong\" with the help of other people, such as Gunpei Yokoi. It was based on an older Nintendo game called \"Radar Scope\", which did not do very well in the United States, so Hiroshi Yamauchi, the president of Nintendo, asked Miyamoto to make a game to replace \"Radar Scope\".\nName.\nThere are a lot of rumors about where the name comes from. One rumor says that someone misheard or mistranslated the phrase \"Monkey Kong\" into \"Donkey Kong\" when talking over the phone or on a fax machine. Another rumor is that Miyamoto used a Japanese-to-English dictionary to find words that meant stubborn gorilla and came up with \"Donkey Kong\".\nReception.\nWhen \"Donkey Kong\" was first announced in America, game magazines thought it was not going to be a good game because it was not like other games being made at the time, which were mostly shooting games. But when it came out, it got great reviews and made a lot of money at the arcades. It is one of Nintendo's most famous games ever made.\nLegacy.\nThere was a documentary made about the game called \"\" where someone tries to beat the high score for the game.\nA lot of items from this game are used in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". There is also a stage that copies the third level.\nSequels and re-releases.\n\"Donkey Kong\" has had many sequels. \"Donkey Kong Jr.\" and \"Donkey Kong 3\" were sequels to this game. The playable character called Mario went on to become the biggest game character of all time, making Nintendo more than 1 billion dollars and releasing more than 200 games, more than any other series. Donkey Kong went on to have his own series apart from Mario, starting with \"Donkey Kong Country\" for the Super NES. Donkey Kong also starred in many more sequels, as well as spin-offs like the \"Donkey Konga\" music games.\n\"Donkey Kong\" has been re-released many times; first on the Nintendo Entertainment System where it was the same game except that it does not have the second level. It has also appeared on other consoles including Atari consoles. A sequel came out for the Game Boy called \"Donkey Kong\", which has the first four levels and 100 new levels after that.\n\"Donkey Kong\" appeared as a bonus game in the Frantic Factory level for \"Donkey Kong 64\".\nThis game has not to be confused with the Game &amp; Watch \"Donkey Kong Jr.\" portable game console, because the history of the game is a little different. In the Game &amp; Watch version, the main character is Donkey Kong Jr., that has to save its father Donkey Kong from Mario. This game recently released for the Nintendo DSi as a downloadable for the cost of 200 Nintendo Points."}

It is also used in British overseas territories, Isle of Man, Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey. The pound is divided into 100 .\nToday's coins are 1 penny, 2 pence, 5 pence, 10 pence, 20 pence, 50 pence, \u00a31 and \u00a32. The notes are \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350.\nAs of July 2021, one pound was equal to 1.39United States dollars.\nEtymology.\nA pound coin originally weighed one troy pound of sterling silver, giving the currency the name \"pound sterling\". \"Sterling silver\" means mixed metal that has 92.5% or more real silver. One pound sterling was originally divided by 240 sterling pence.\u00a0This was because there are 240 pennyweights in a troy pound. So a single one\u2013pound coin weighed one troy pound and a single 1\u2013penny coin weighed one pennyweight.\nThe Latin word for \"pound\" is \"libra\". The \u00a3 or \u20a4 is a stylised writing of the letter L, a short way of writing \"libra\". This is similar to how a pound of mass is abbreviated \"lb\". Up until around the 1970s, especially on typewriters or keyboards without a \"\u00a3\" symbol, it was common to write \"L\" instead of \"\u00a3\".\nThe symbol for pennies is p. The British write 50p or \u00a30.50 and say it \"fifty pence\" or simply \"fifty pee\"\nThe old system.\nThe pound has only been divided into 100 pence since 1971. Before this time it was divided into 20 shillings. Each shilling was divided into 12 pennies.\nThe symbols for shilling and penny came from Roman coins: \"s\" for shilling (from the Latin word \"solidus\") and \"d\" for penny (from the Latin \"denarius\"). The penny was divided into 4 farthings. The farthing became obsolete (was no longer used) in 1961 because it was worth so little.\nCoins just before the change in 1971 were: 1/2d (ha'penny), 1d (one penny), 3d (threepence; the coin was called a \"thrup'ny bit\"); 6d (sixpence); 1s (one shilling, also called one \"bob\"); 2s (a florin); 2s6d (half a crown; the crown, 5s (a quarter of a pound sterling), was not used in modern times).\nHow prices were written and pronounced in the old system:\nThere was also a guinea. Originally the guinea was a gold coin. Although the coin had not been minted or circulated for a long time, prices were still sometimes given in guineas. A guinea was 21s (or \u00a31 1s 0d). A price of 58 guineas was, in fact, \u00a360 18s 0d, which sounds more than \"58 guineas\".\nDecimalisation.\nIn circulation before 1971 were the halfpenny, penny, threepence, sixpence, shilling, florin, crown, sovereign, ten shilling note, and the one, five, 10, 20 and 50 pound notes.\nThe crown and sovereign were legal currency before 1971. By then they were commemorative coins and not commonly found in circulation. They are both still legal currency at a value of 25 pence and \u00a31 respectively.\nIn 1971, the pound sterling of the United Kingdom and the Irish Pound of Ireland were decimalised (divided into 100). Most coins were de-monetised. \u00a31 was equal to 100 pence after then. One shilling became 5 pence, remaining of \u00a31. \u00a31 stayed the same."}

The study of the processes of wear is part of the discipline of tribology.\nThere are four principal wear processes:\nExplanation.\nThe definition of wear does not include loss of dimension from plastic deformation, although wear can happen without loss of material. Also this definition does not include impact wear where there is no sliding motion or cavitation (also corrosion) where counterbody is a fluid..\nWear, along with other aging processes such as fatigue, creep, and fracture toughness, causes progressive degradation of materials with time leading to failure of material at an advanced age. Under normal circumstances, the property changes during usage normally occur in three different stages as follows:-\n\u2022 Primary or early stage or run-in period, where rate of changes can be high. \n\u2022 Secondary or mid-age process where a steady rate of aging process is maintained. The useful or working life is at this stage.\n\u2022 Tertiary or old-age stage, where rapid rate of aging leads to early failure.\nWith increasing severity of environmental conditions, such as, higher temperatures, strain rates, stress and sliding velocities, the secondary stage is shortened and the primary stage tends to merge with the tertiary stage, thus drastically reducing the working life. Surface engineering processes are used to minimize wear and extend working life of material.\nAdhesive wear.\nAdhesive wear is also known as scoring, galling, or seizing. It happens when two solid surfaces slide over one another under pressure.\nAbrasive wear.\nThis happens when material is removed by contact with hard particles. The particles either may be present at the surface of a second material or may exist as loose particles between two surfaces. \nAbrasive wear can be measured as loss of mass by the Taber Abrasion Test according to ISO 9352 or ASTM D 1044.\nCorrosive wear.\nOften referred to simply as \u201ccorrosion\u201d, corrosive wear is deterioration of useful properties in a material due to reactions with its environment.\nSurface fatigue.\nSurface fatigue is a process by which the surface of a material is weakened by cyclic loading, which is one type of general material fatigue."}

It reached the present size with the adding of Kurzrickenbach in 1927 and Emmishofen in 1928.\nGeography.\nIt is located on Lake Constance.\nIt is halfway between Schaffhausen and Rorschach.\nHistory.\nThe name of the municipality stems from the Augustinian monastery \"Crucelin\", which was later renamed Kreuzlingen Abbey. It was built in 1125 by the Bishop of Constance, Ulrich I. In the Swabian War and the 30 Years' War after the siege of Constance by Swedish troops, Kreuzlingen Abbey was burned down by the people of Constance. The crime was blamed on the monks for having supported the enemy. In 1650, the monastery was rebuilt in its present location. Because of secularization in 1848, the buildings became a school. The chapel became a Catholic church\nPeople already lived in the Kreuzlingen area during the Bronze Age. Celtic and Roman coins and artifacts show that people continued to be settled in the area pre-writing. Kurzrickenbach is first mentioned as \"Rihinbah\" in 830, Egelshofen is mentioned as \"Eigolteshoven\" in 1125, and Emmishofen is mentioned as \"Eminshoven\" in 1159. The territory of the municipality, except for the Augustinian monastery, belonged to the Bishop of Constance. \nUntil the beginning of the 19th century, the current centre of Kreuzlingen was still largely agricultural. The first steamboats began to operate on Lake Constance in 1824. The first train line to Romanshorn was finished in 1871, and the second to Etzwilen in 1875. This brought commerce and industry to the area. In 1874, Kreuzlingen became the capital of the district, instead of the previous capital, Gottlieben. However, until World War I, Kreuzlingen was a kind of suburb of Constance. Most of its profits went to German firms. The war made Kreuzlingen more independent.\nw:The Sanatorium of Bellevue (1857-1980), which occupied part of the old monastery, played an important role in the history of Kreuzlingen. In 1842, a man called Ignaz Vanotti from Constance bought a large area of land and constructed a building to house the emigrant press of Bellevue in 1843, which had been located in R\u00f6merburg before. In 1857, Ludwig Binswanger, a psychiatrist from M\u00fcnsterlingen bought the property and opened a private sanatorium. The clinic was very modern and stayed in the control of the Binswanger family for nearly 120 years. Important psychiatric discoveries, particularly under the founder's grandson's control, especially in the development of existential psychotherapy, were made at the sanatorium. However, few of its buildings remain.\nEconomy.\nEarlier, most of the people in Kreuzlingen made a living in the wine industry. However, because of diseases and bad harvests, the last wine grapes were raised in Kreuzlingen in 1938.\nToday, the local economy is mostly shopping and handcraft, with the largest employer being a clothing maker."}

{"id": "80241", "revid": "1103633", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80241", "title": "Bruise", "text": "A bruise, also called a contusion or an ecchymosis, is a visible bluish or purplish mark or patch appearing beneath the surface of the skin, resulting from blood that leaked out of the deeper layers of the tissues. Bruises are usually caused by a blow or pressure. In older people, bruises may also occur without a special reason.\nBruises often cause pain but are normally not dangerous. Sometimes bruises can be serious and lead to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, or they can be associated with serious injuries such as fractures and internal bleeding. Minor bruises may be easily recognized, in people with light skin color, by their characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as \"black and blue\") in the days following the injury.\nHow long do bruises last?\nBruises change color over time. That is because the body is fixing the bruise by breaking down and reabsorbing the blood, which makes the bruise to go through many colors before it later disappears. The age of a bruise can be guessed by looking at its color.\nUsually, a bruise takes about two weeks to fade away. Some people bruise easily, but others do not. This is because they may have more tough skin tissue, certain diseases or conditions, or they take certain kinds of medication.\nAlso, blood vessels tend to become fragile as people get older, which is why elderly people receive a bruise much more easily.\nSpeeding the healing process.\nApplying cold when the bruise is discovered helps make it smaller, because it stops the blood that's flowing to the area. It also keeps the swelling down. It is best to apply ice to the bruise for half an hour to an hour at a time for a day or two after the bruise first appears. However, it is not advisable to place ice right on the skin. Putting some icecubes in a plastic bag and wrapping a towel around the bag is a better idea to stop the bruise from getting worse.\nAnother way to help heal the bruise is to put the bruised area above the level of the heart. This helps to slow the flow of the blood because more of the blood in the bruise will flow back toward the rest of the body instead of leaking out into the tissues. If this is not done, more blood will flow into the bruise and make it grow.\nIf the bruise causes pain, painkillers, such as NSAIDs may be used against the pain. Certain creams exist to help with bruises. These creams usually combine a substance that helps skin growth with one that acts against the pain. Gently massaging the area of the bruise may also help recovery, and stop the pain, according to the gate theory of pain. If the massage is painful, it will not help the healing process. As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until at least three days after the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped. Increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into the area and encourage drainage, but if the injury is still bleeding this will also allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse. In most cases, hematomas spontaneously revert. In cases of large hematomas or those localized in certain organs (\"e.g.\", the brain), a physician may perform a puncture of the hematoma to allow the blood to exit.\nBruises as a sign of other conditions.\nBruises that do not result from the application of force (blunt trauma) may be a symptom for other conditions: People with such bruises often have a problem with their blood. Platelet or coagulation disorders often lead to the increased bruising. Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer.\nDuring an autopsy, bruises accompanying abrasions indicate the abrasions occurred while the person was alive, as opposed to damage that occurred after death"}

He died in Oviedo on 13 May 1901.\nClarin lived in Le\u00f3n and Guadalajara in his childhood, then he moved to Oviedo in 1865. There he studied \"Bachillerato\" (high school) and he started his law career. He lived in Madrid from 1871 to 1878, where he started his career as a journalist and he graduated with the thesis \"El Derecho y la Moralidad\" (\"Law and Morality\"). He taught in Zaragoza from 1882 to 1883. In 1883 he returned to Oviedo to take up a position as teacher of Roman law.\nHe wrote books including \"La Regenta\". It is a long work, similar to Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\", one of the books that helped to inspire it. Other influences included Naturalism and \"Kraussism\", a philosophical trend which made cultural and moral change in Spain. He also wrote Nuevo viaje al Parnaso and La Literatura en 1881 (1882), working with Armando Palacio Valdes.\n\"La Regenta\" is special for its great number of characters and other stories around the main story of the novel. The main character is shown in a way that is not very clear. On the other hand, the downfall of the provincial lady has place amidst two very different men who want to marry her: the most handsome man in the city, who is the winner in the end, and the cathedral's priest. The way the priest is shown is a very important part of the book.\nFor the description of the provincial setting and the city's collective life, Clar\u00edn used styles such as the internal monologue or the free indirect style, which makes the story be told by the characters, not the narrator.\nIn 1890, he published a new novel, \"Su \u00fanico hijo\". Most critics do not think it is as good as \"La Regenta\". \"Su \u00fanico hijo\" was originally meant to be the first of a series of three books, but these were not written. The only parts of them that exist are an outline and a few fragments of two of the novels. \"Su \u00fanico hijo\" was Clar\u00edn's last long book.\nClar\u00edn also wrote some stories and some journalistic articles.\nClarin remains a rather unknown figure in the Spanish literary world. He searched for God and was Humanist at the same time. This strange mix has led to there being different views on the meaning of his writings. \"La Regenta\" in particular has many different views on what it could mean."}

Manchukuo's government was removed in 1945 at the end of World War II. The Soviet Union invaded in August 1945, and formally transferred the territory to Chinese administration in the following year. Although the territories came under the jurisdiction of the Nationalist government, the brief Soviet occupation helped make the region into a base for the Chinese Communist troops, led by Mao Zedong. The People's Liberation Army got Japanese equipment and a strategic advantage against the National Revolutionary Army led by Chiang Kai-shek.\nManchus formed a minority in Manchukuo, whose largest ethnic group were Han Chinese.

He spent several months trying to find names that were both multi-cultural and Canadian, consulting Amerindian scholars without finding a name that seemed good. In March 2001, he was reading an Inuit story to his children and had a revelation. The ijiraq plays at hide-and-seek, which is what these small moons of Saturn do: they are hard to find, and cold like the Canadian Arctic (the team of discoverers includes Canadians, Norwegians and Icelandic's\u2014Nordicity is their common trait). Kavelaars contacted the author of the tale, Michael Kusugak, to get his assent, and the latter also suggested the names for Kiviuq and 90377 Sedna."}

The government did this by killing between 800,000 and 1,800,000 Armenian people. They also made many Armenians leave their homes (this is called relocation).\nPeople who deny the Armenian Genocide say that these things partially or never happened. They also say that the Ottoman government never, in an organized way, tried to commit genocide against the Armenian people. For example, the United States of America and Republic of Turkey does not accept that the Ottoman government tried to get rid of all the Armenian people in the Empire.\nStudy of Armenian Genocide Denial.\nIn 1990, psychologist Robert Jay Lifton got a letter from the Turkish Ambassador to the United States. In the letter, the Ambassador asked Lifton how he could have talked about the Armenian Genocide in one of his books (because the Ambassador believed the Genocide never happened). By mistake, the Ambassador also included a draft of a letter written by scholar Heath Lowry, which told him how to keep the Armenian Genocide from being talked about in books. Lowry was later named to a chair (an important position) at Princeton University. Princeton had been given a $750,000 grant from the Republic of Turkey. This brought up many arguments about ethics in scholarship.\nOpen University of Israel scholar Yair Auron has talked about the different ways the Turkish government has tried to make it seem like the Armenian Genocide never happened:\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles scholar Leo Kuper, in a review on Ervin Staub's \"The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence\" research, writes:\nIssues Regarding Deniers.\nOutlawing.\nSome countries, including Argentina, Switzerland, and Uruguay, have created laws that punish people who deny the Armenian Genocide. France passed a law which made Armenian Genocide denial a crime, but then reversed it.\nThe first person found guilty by a court of law for denying the Armenian Genocide is Turkish politician Do\u011fu Perin\u00e7ek. He was found guilty by a Swiss district court in Lausanne in March 2007. Perin\u00e7ek appealed the court's decision. Ferai Tin\u00e7, a writer for Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper, said, \"we find these type of [laws] against freedom of opinion dangerous because we are struggling in our country to achieve freedom of thought.\"\nAfter the court's decision, Perin\u00e7ek said, \"I defend my right to freedom of expression.\"\nAdvertisement.\nThe Ankara Chamber of Commerce included DVDs, accusing the Armenian people of killing Turks, with their paid tourism advertisements in the June 6, 2005 edition of the magazine TIME Europe. Time Europe later apologized for allowing the DVDs to be included, and published a letter saying the DVDs were wrong, signed by five French organizations. The February 12, 2007 edition of TIME Europe included a page saying that the Armenian Genocide did really happen. It also included a DVD of a documentary by French director Laurence Jourdan about the Genocide."}

Two games of chess are played in at the same time. If a player one game captures a piece, following the regular rules of chess, they give that piece to their partner to use in the other game. The partner can put the piece on the board instead of making a normal move.

The depression formed on August 13 from a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 8. Because of strong wind shear, the depression stayed weak and did not strengthen much. The cyclone itself had no effect on land and did not cause any damage. It mostly died out on August 14, but its remains later helped to form another storm, Hurricane Katrina. Katrina became one of the worst hurricanes in the history of the United States.\nStorm history.\nThe tropical depression began as a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 8, 2005. The wave moved west and began to show signs of becoming stronger on August 11. The system formed into Tropical Depression Ten at 12:00 UTC on August 13. At the time, it was about to the east of Barbados. When the storm was first called a tropical depression, it had a large area of thunderstorms, with curved rainbands.\nThe depression slowly moved west, and wind shear stopped the storm from becoming much stronger. Late on August 13, a weather forecaster said that it was \"beginning to look like Irene-junior\". They said this because it was mid-level shear happening in the storm towards the southwest \"beneath the otherwise favorable upper-level outflow pattern\". This means that the storm looked similar to Hurricane Irene.\nEarly on August 14, the wind shear tore apart the storm. The center of the storm separated from the thunderstorm areas. Later that day, the cyclone became even weaker. The National Hurricane Center gave their final warning on Tropical Depression Ten, and the storm mostly disappeared. However, its remains produced a few bursts of thunderstorm activity for several days, before completely stopping on August 18.\nEnergy left over from Tropical Depression Ten helped to form Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23. Normally, if a depression disappears and forms again, it keeps the same number. However, the formation of Tropical Depression Twelve involved other weather systems, including another tropical wave. Tropical Depression Twelve later became Hurricane Katrina.\nImpact.\nTropical Depression Ten did not hit land. Because of this, no tropical cyclone watches and warnings were given out. It did not damage anything or cause any people's deaths, and no ships reported strong winds. Also the depression never became a tropical storm, so it was not given a name by the National Hurricane Center. \nAfter the depression mostly died, part of its remains contributed to the formation of Tropical Depression Twelve, which later intensified into Hurricane Katrina. Katrina later became a Category 5 hurricane and reached the land in Louisiana, where it caused much damage, becoming one of the worst hurricanes in the history of the United States."}

Non-spherical and reddish in colour, it is thought to have of water ice with unknown amounts of other materials. Its surface has big craters and high mountains.\nPictures of Amalthea were taken in 1979 and 1980 by the \"Voyager 1 and 2\" spacecraft, and later, in more detail, by the \"Galileo\" orbiter in the 1990s.\nDiscovery and naming.\nAmalthea was found on September 9, 1892 by Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36 inch (91 cm) telescope at Lick Observatory. It was the first new moon of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei's discovery of the Galilean moons in 1610.\nThe moon is named after the nymph Amalthea from Greek mythology who nursed the infant Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter) with goat's milk. Its Roman numeral designation is . The name \"Amalthea\" was not adopted by the IAU until 1975, although it had been in use for many decades. The name was suggested by Camille Flammarion. Before 1975, Amalthea was most commonly known simply as . The adjectival form of the name is \"Amalthean\".\nOrbit.\nAmalthea circles Jupiter at a distance of 181,000\u00a0km (2.54 Jupiter radii). The orbit of Amalthea has an eccentricity of 0.003 and an inclination of 0.37\u00b0 relative to the equator of Jupiter.\nPhysical characteristics.\nThe surface of Amalthea is very red The reddish color may be due to sulfur coming from Io or some other non ice material. Bright patches of green appear on the major slopes of Amalthea, but the nature of this color is currently unknown. The surface of Amalthea is a bit brighter than surfaces of other closer moons of Jupiter.\nHow Amalthea looks from Jupiter.\nFrom Jupiter's surface \u2014or rather, from just above its cloudtops\u2014 Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a magnitude of \u22124.7, similar to that of Venus from Earth.\nHow Jupiter looks from Amalthea.\nFrom the surface of Amalthea, Jupiter would look enormous: it would look 92 times bigger than the Full Moon.\nExploration.\nIn 1979-1980, the \"Voyager 1 and 2\" spacecraft made the first images of Amalthea, which resolved its surface.

It was the American, British, and French occupied sectors that were created in 1945.\nIn many ways it was integrated (joined) with West Germany, but it was not a part of West Germany or East Germany. The Soviet sector became East Berlin, which East Germany claimed as its capital. The Western Allies never recognized this claim. They said that the whole city was still under four-power occupation. The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 surrounded West Berlin.\nWest Berlin was called \"Berlin (West)\" by the West Germany government, and usually by the East German government. The east German spelling suggested that West Berlin was not really part of \"Berlin\" as a whole, but a separate place. East Berlin was officially called \"Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR\" (\"Berlin, Capital of the GDR\"), or simply \"Berlin,\" by East Germany.\nOrigins.\nThe Potsdam Agreement of the four wartime allies decided on dividing up Germany. At first it was only a temporary measure, until a permanent way to reunite a peaceful Germany and Berlin could be worked out.\nWhen the cold war began, the joint administration of Germany and Berlin broke down. Soon Soviet-occupied Berlin and western-occupied Berlin were managed by separate governments.\nIn 1948, the Soviets tried to force the western allies out of Berlin by a blockade of the western sectors. The Soviets blocked roads, railways and waterways, but the Potsdam Agreement guaranteed air corridors to Berlin. Because the western allies flew in all the supplies that normally came by land, the Berlin Blockade is also known as the Berlin Airlift. The Blockade ended in May 1949. By the end of 1949, two new states had been created out of occupied Germany - the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) in the West and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in the East - with West Berlin an enclave that was not part of either.\nLegal status.\nAccording to the western allies, the occupation of most of Germany ended in 1949 when the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were set up. But the occupation of Berlin could only be ended by a quadripartite (four power) agreement, so Berlin remained an occupied territory under the formal control of all the allies. This is why the \"Grundgesetz\" (constitution of the Federal Republic) never applied in West Berlin.\nThe Soviets declared the occupation of East Berlin ended when East Germany was set up. This move was not recognised by the western allies who continued to view all of Berlin as a jointly occupied territory belonging to neither of the two states.\nHowever, in many ways, West Berlin functioned as the \"de facto\" 11th state of West Germany.\nBut the western allies remained the ultimate political authorities there. The allies could appoint the Mayor and city government at Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg, but they never chose anyone except the elected mayor.\nThere were differences between West Germany and West Berlin.\nThe years of division.\nWhile West Berlin was separate from East Berlin after 1949, people could easily move between the two parts until 1961. In many ways Berlin worked as a single city. The U-Bahn and S-Bahn public transit networks, rebuilt after the war, spanned all occupation sectors. Many people lived in one half of the city and had family members, friends, and jobs in the other.\nAs the Cold War continued, many East Germans began leaving East Germany for the West. East Germany closed the borders between East and West Germany in 1952, but did not seal off West Berlin; because there was freedom of movement between West Berlin and West Germany, Easterners could use the city as a crossing point to the West. To stop this drain, the East German government built the Berlin Wall, thus physically closing off West Berlin from East Germany, on 13 August 1961. It was still possible to travel from West Berlin to West Germany by air and by specific rail and autobahn transit routes set aside for that purpose, but inhabitants of the two Berlins were now physically and legally separated from each other.\nThe Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971) and the Transit Agreement (May 1972), helped to ease the tensions over West Berlin and made it a little easier for West Berliners to travel to East Germany and for Germans travelling along the road routes into the city instead of flying.\nOn 9 November 1989 the wall was opened, and the two cities were once again physically - but not legally - united. German reunification soon ended the western occupation of West Berlin. On 3 October 1990 West Berlin and East Berlin were united as the city of Berlin, which then joined the Federal Republic as a \"state,\" along with the rest of East Germany. West Berlin and East Berlin thus both formally ceased to exist.\nDistricts of West Berlin.\nWest Berlin comprised the following boroughs:\nIn the American Sector:\nIn the British Sector:\nIn the French Sector:"}

The art looks to get an emotional effect, and transmits personal moods and ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of \"being alive\" and emotional experience rather than physical reality.\nExpressionism is exhibited in many art forms, including: painting, literature, theatre, dance, film, architecture and music. The term often implies emotional angst. In a general sense, painters such El Greco could be called expressionist; in practice, the term is applied only to 20th century works.\nThe Expressionist stress on the individual perspective was also a reaction to positivism and other artistic movements such as naturalism and impressionism.\nTypical modern expressionists are Edvard Munch (\"The Scream\"), August Macke, Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde, Marc Chagall, and others.

People who belong to the religion call themselves \"Celtic Reconstructionists\" or \"Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans\". Sometimes they just call themseleves \"CRs\".\nThe Celts were the people who lived long ago in many parts of Europe, but mainly in the countries of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Gaul (modern-day France). The Modern Celts are the people who live in those countries now, or whose ancestors lived there.\nLike the ancient Celts did before them, CRs are polytheistic and have many gods and goddesses. They believe in spirits and ancestors, too, and they often honour them with rituals and offerings. Offerings to the spirits might be food, or songs, or poetry. CRs often learn the languages spoken by the Celts, if they do not speak them already. These languages include the Irish language, Scottish Gaelic, the Welsh language and others.\nCeltic Reconstructionists are a type of Pagan Reconstructionist. Reconstructionists believe in practicing a religion that is from one culture. They are different from eclectic Pagans, who mix parts of different cultures together.\nHow it started.\nCeltic Reconstructionist Paganism (CR) started in the 1980s, when people interested in the Celts and in Paganism were looking for an authentic religion. By the 1990s there were lots of CRs. Some of them met each other at Pagan gatherings, and later more people met each other on the Internet.\nThe first person to write about being a \"Celtic Reconstructionist Pagan\" was Kym Lambert n\u00ed Dhoireann. She wrote this in the Spring, 1992 issue of \"Harvest\" Magazine. She says she got the idea for the name from Kathryn Price NicDh\u00e0na, who had also written about it. Margot Adler's 1979 book, \"Drawing Down the Moon\" has a chapter on \"Pagan Reconstructionists\", and Kathryn NicDh\u00e0na says this is probably where she got the idea, even though the book does not mention Celtic Reconstructionists, just other kinds.\nWhat Celtic Reconstructionists believe, and what they do.\nCeltic Reconstructionists base their religion on what we know of the Ancient Celtic people's religion, and also on Celtic folklore. They focus on a particular Celtic culture, such as the Gaelic Welsh or Gaulish. Many CRs are scholars, or mystics, though many believe it's important to be both. CRs read lots of books and do things like meditation, prayer, and rituals. CRs believe that honesty and honorable behaviour is important.\nMany CRs view each act of daily life as a form of ritual, and they accompany daily activities with traditional prayers, chants and songs from sources such as the Scottish Gaelic \"Carmina Gadelica\" or manuscript collections of ancient Irish or Welsh poetry.\nCommunity rituals are usually based on traditional community celebrations found in folkloric collections by authors such as Marian McNeill, Kevin Danaher or John Gregorson Campbell. These celebrations often involve bonfires, dances, songs, divination and children's games. More formal or mystical CR rituals are often based on traditional techniques of interacting with the Otherworld, such as the act of making offerings of food, drink and art to the spirits of the land, ancestral spirits, and the Celtic deities. CR ritual structures are based on the ancient Celtic idea of the \"Three Realms\" - Land, Sea and Sky - with the fire of inspiration seen as a central, uniting force. Many CRs have altars and shrines to the spirits and deities they believe in. They may place these altars at outdoor, natural locations such as wells, streams, and special trees.

National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts had correctly predicted the strengthening, however, and hurricane watches and warnings were properly given out nearly 36 and 24 hours, before hurricane conditions were felt in the area.\nGulf Coast.\nOn August 27, after Katrina crossed southern Florida and strengthened to a Category 3 storm, President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi two days before the hurricane made landfall.\nOn August 28, the National Weather Service in Slidell, Louisiana, issued a bulletin predicting \"devastating\" damage rivaling the intensity of Hurricane Camille. Necessary evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast Louisiana as well as coastal Mississippi and Alabama.\nOn Sunday, August 28, Canadian National Railway (CN) stopped all rail traffic on its lines south of McComb, Mississippi, (lines owned by its subsidiary Illinois Central Railroad that extend into New Orleans), expectating damage from the hurricane. To help continue services after the storm passes, CN also issued an embargo with the Association of American Railroads against all deliveries to points south of Osyka, Mississippi. CSX Transportation also suspended service south of Montgomery, Alabama until further notice.\nAmtrak, America's rail passenger carrier, announced that the southbound \"City of New Orleans\" passenger trains from Chicago, Illinois, from August 29 through September 3, would stop at Memphis, Tennessee, rather than their usual destination of New Orleans. The trains traveling northbound would also start at Memphis. The southbound \"Crescent\" from New York City, for the same period, stopped in Atlanta, Georgia, with the northbound trains starting in Atlanta as well. Amtrak's westbound \"Sunset Limited\" started in San Antonio, Texas, rather than its usual starting point of Orlando, Florida. Amtrak announced that no alternate transportation options would be made available into or out of the affected area.\nThe Waterford nuclear power plant was also shut down on Sunday, August 28, before Katrina's arrival.\nNew Orleans.\nBy August 26, the possibility of never-before-happened destruction and damage was already being considered. Some computer models were putting the city of New Orleans right in the center of their track probabilities, and the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17% (with strike probability rising to 29% by August 28). This scenario was considered a potential disaster because 80% of the New Orleans metropolitan area is below sea level along Lake Pontchartrain. Since the storm surge produced by the hurricane's right-front quadrant (containing the strongest winds) was more than 20 ft (6 m) near Biloxi, emergency management officials in New Orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city, causing major flooding. This risk of devastation had been known for some time; previous studies by FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers had warned that a direct hurricane strike on New Orleans could lead to massive flooding, which would lead to thousands of drowning deaths, as well as many more suffering from disease and dehydration, as the flood waters slowly retreated from the city.\nAt a news conference 10:00 AM on August 28, shortly after Katrina was upgraded to a Category 5 storm, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin ordered the first ever mandatory evacuation of the city, calling Katrina, \"a storm that most of us have long feared\". To speed up the evacuations, authorities used contraflow lane reversal on Interstate 10 leading west of New Orleans, as well as on Interstate 55 and Interstate 59 leading north from the city. The city government also established several \"refuges of last resort\" for citizens who could not leave the city, including the massive Louisiana Superdome, which housed approximately 26,000 people with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore. The Louisiana National Guard delivered three truckloads of water and seven truckloads of MRE's to the Superdome, enough to supply 15,000 people for three days.\nLouisiana's hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to call for evacuations in three phases, starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds. Persons in areas designated Phase II begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in Phase III areas (including New Orleans) evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds.\nHowever, many parishes were not able to provide sufficient transportation for citizens who did not have private means of evacuation, and many private care-taking facilities who relied on the same bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges. Fuel and rental cars were in short supply and many forms of public transportation had been shut down well before the storm arrived. The end result was that hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists were unable to evacuate and remained in the city. Nonetheless, some estimates claimed that 90-92% of the 1.3 million residents of the New Orleans metropolitan region evacuated including 80% of Orleans parish."}

Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty, but they have also been called part of an informal understanding between opposing forces.\nHistorical examples.\nWorld War I.\nOn December 24, 1914, during World War I, there was an unofficial ceasefire as both the Germans and the British sought to observe Christmas (the \"Christmas Truce\"). There was no treaty signed, and after a few days the war resumed.\nKorean War.\nA ceasefire was reached on July 27, 1953 to halt the conflict of the Korean War and establish a demilitarized zone. But no peace treaty has been signed. Therefore, officially North and South Korea are still at war.\nPresent examples.\nKashmir conflict.\nPakistan's government has repeatedly claimed that the Republic of India is violating the Simla Agreement by constructing a fence along the cesefire line in the Kashmir Conflict. Then-Pakistani President and ex-Army Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan) Pervez Musharraf promised in 2002 to curb infiltration into the Territorial dispute. After the November 2003 ceasefire line agreement, building resumed and was completed in late 2004. LoC fencing was completed in Kashmir Valley and Jammu region on 30 September 2004. According to Indian Military sources, the fence has reduced by 80% the numbers of militants who routinely cross into the occupied territory of the disputed state to attack Indian soldiers.\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nAnother example of a ceasefire in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict was announced between the State of Israel and the Palestinian National Authority on February 8, 2005. When announced, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat publicly defined the ceasefire as follows: \"We have agreed that today President Mahmoud Abbas will declare a full cessation of violence against Israelis anywhere and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will declare a full cessation of violence and military activities against Palestinians anywhere.\""}

He taught composition at the \"Berlin Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik\" (the Berlin Conservatoire) from 1890 until his retirement in 1910.\nHis conservatively structured works, in the German romantic musical tradition, placed him in the camp of Romantic classicism exemplified by Johannes Brahms, rather than the opposing \"New Music\" of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner.

Archaeological digs in 1885 and 1944 have uncovered stilt houses from the Stone and Bronze Ages. At first, it was assumed that these were built over water, since they were raised on stilts. However, it is now known that they were on the shore and were built in this fashion because the ground was swampy.\nDuring Roman times, \"Bergli\" was probably a Roman fort. The raised situation and view over the lake were strategically important. Since 1957, regular excavations have shown the remains of late Roman fortifications. The Latin name of Arbon, \"Arbor Felix\" (meaning \"happy tree\"), first appears in the \"Itinerarium Antonini\" in 300.\nAccording to the chronicles of Ammianus Marcellinus, Emperor Gratian went to Arbon in 378, and stayed there until 401. \nIn the 8th century, the area became part of the territory of the Franks.\nIn 610, Irish monks who were followers of Columban of Luxeuil settled in Arbon. They found a small Christian settlement called \"Castrum\" there. One of these monks was St. Gallus, the founder of the monastery of St. Gallen. He died in 627 in Arbon. In 720, a fortification on the site of the present castle was built by a Frankish troop. The foundations of this early fortress remain.\nEcclesiastically, Arbon belonged to the territory of the Bishop of Constance. In 1255, Bishop Eberhard von Waldburg gave Arbon a dispensation for market rights in the area and built the city wall. That century saw an influx of inhabitants from the surrounding farms. From 1262 to 1264, and again in 1266, the young Duke of Swabia, Conradin of Hohenstaufen, resided in Arbon because the Bishop of Constance was his guardian. The surrounding towns of Steinach, M\u00f6rschwil, Horn, Goldach, Egnach, Roggwil, and Steinebrunn all belonged to the parish of Arbon.\nThe 14th century saw further growth. Linen production and other crafts developed. Between 1322 and 1334, Bishop Rudolf von Montfort rebuilt the crumbling fortress. A fire of unknown cause in 1390 destroyed much of the \"Altstadt\". A second fire in 1494 was set by the sons of a hanged thief.\nWhen Thurgau was conquered by the Swiss \"Eidgenossen\" in 1460, the Bishops of Constance retained Arbon. However, in the Swabian War of 1499, they lost civil rights over the territory, retaining only ecclesiastical supremacy. Arbon then became part of the Old Swiss Confederacy.\nThe castle of Arbon in its present form was built in 1515 by Bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg. The tower is older and dates to 993.\nIn 1525, the first stirrings of the Reformation reached Arbon. In 1537, the reformed congregation was forced to return the church of St. Martin to the Catholic Church and meet in the chapel in Erdhausen, although only a small minority of the population remained Catholic. Religious conflict continued until the 18th century. In 1712, Thurgau declared equality for the various faiths.\nIn the 18th century, the linen and embroidery industry was established in Arbon. The industrialists built attractive villas in the area, such as the \u00abRotes Haus\u00bb built in 1750.\nIn 1798, Thurgau was occupied by French troops, along with much of the rest of Switzerland. The adoption of the Swiss constitution ended Arbon's dependence on the Bishops of Constance. The Bishop's representative, Franz Xaver Wirz von Rudenz, was forced to leave the city. In 1803, Arbon became part of the new canton of Thurgau. From 1803 to 1815, Arbon and Horn (an exclave in the canton of St. Gallen) were united in one municipality.\nIn the 19th century, Arbon developed into an economic and manufacturing center. This occurred primarily because of the pioneering efforts of industrialist Franz Saurer, who move his foundry from St. Gallen to Arbon in 1863. Starting in 1888, his factory built all kinds of machinery and motors. Until 1983, the factory produced trucks and buses, and until 1986 military vehicles. Today, the factory produces only textile machinery. At its high point, the factory employed 5000 workers. The population grew from 660 in 1844 to over 10,000 at the turn of the century.\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, Arbon has had a large non-Swiss minority. Tensions between ethnic groups led to riots with several fatalities in 1902.\nIn 1911, Arbon was the site of the International Socialist Congress. From the 1920s to the 1950s, the Social Democratic majority held power in the city, and it was known as \"red Arbon\".\nPopulation.\nThe population of the city of Arbon is about 13,000 people."}

Leonardo da Vinci and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe were geniuses who can also be described as polymaths because they were brilliant in lots of different subjects. Geniuses are usually child prodigies, i.e., they already show they are a genius when they are young children.\nGenius is not quite the same as talent. Talent means the ability to learn a particular skill very quickly. A genius, on the other hand, is also very creative and able to do things that no one else has thought of.\nSome geniuses, such as Goethe, are very sensible, reliable people who are good at organizing their lives. However, there are many geniuses who have unusual personalities. They may be very absent-minded, they may not have much common sense, or they may suffer at times from depression and changes of mood."}

According to a statistical survey done in 2000, 44% of the population are Protestant (including Jehovas Witnesses, and the New Apostolic Church), 37.3% are Roman Catholic, 6.5% are Muslims, 6.5% are non-believers, 2.3% are either Eastern orthodox or Oriental orthodox and 3.7% belonged to other communities or did not say.\nGeography.\nThe canton of Glarus is dominated by the deep valley of the Linth River. Most of the area is mountainous. The total area of the canton of Glarus is 685 km\u00b2.\nHistory.\nThe history of this canton is dominated by religion. The people who lived in the Linth Valley were converted to Christianity in the 6th century by the Irish monk Saint Fridolin. He is still in the coat of arms of the canton today. He started S\u00e4ckingen Abbey near Basel. The area around Glarus was owned by the abbey starting in the 9th century. By 1288, the Habsburgs slowly took over all the abbey's rights. Then the people of Glarus joined the Swiss Confederation in 1352.\nBetween 1506 and 1516, the reformer Huldrych Zwingli was a priest in Glarus. By 1564, all of Zwingli's followers were eliminated, but the Protestants and Catholics there still fought with each other. To make peace it was decided that each side should have its own assembly (\"Landsgemeinde\") in 1623. In 1683, each side was granted the right to have its own tribunals.\nBetween 1798 and 1803, Glarus was part of the Canton of Linth made by Napoleon. In 1836 the constitution was changed to unite the assemblies and establish only one \"Landsgemeinde\".\nAbout two thirds of Glarus (593 buildings) were destroyed after a big fire in 1861. After the fire, Glarus was rebuilt in block fashion according to construction plans by Bernhard Simon and Johann Caspar Wolff.\nOn May 6, 2007 Glarus became the first Swiss canton to lower the voting age to 16.\nIndustry.\nThe land of the canton helped to make slate works in the 1600s.\nMunicipalities.\nThe 25 municipalities (\"gemeinden\") were:"}

An electrical unit called the ampere is named after him.\nLife.\nAmpere was born in France in 1775. During his childhood, Ampere's father taught him Latin, until he found out that his son was talented in mathematical studies. However, young Ampere continued his study on Latin, so that he could understand and master the works of Euler and Bernoulli. In his later life, Ampere began to distinguish himself in mathematics, but also he studied history, travels, poetry, philosophy, and the natural sciences.\nDuring the French Revolution, a great sorrow came to Ampere's life; he lost his father who was executed by revolutionaries. The death of his father brought a huge impact to Ampere.\nIn 1796, he met the daughter of a blacksmith living near Lyon named Julie Carron, and married her in 1799. Afterward, Ampere worked as a professor in Lyon, giving lessons in mathematics, chemistry, languages, and physics. He continued working as a professor even after the death of his wife in 1803. However, her death bothered Ampere for the rest of his life. Ampere died at Marseille and buried in the Cimetiere de Montmartre, Paris. In his work \"Journal et correspondence\", we can see his amiability and childlike simplicity of character.\nWorks.\nAmpere is most known for establishing the relationship between electricity and magnetism, and combining them into a new field called electromagnetism, or electrodynamics. On September 11, 1820, Ampere heard from the discovery of H.C.Orsted that a magnetic needle can be activated by a voltaic current. Only a week later, he came up with a much more advanced version of that kindred phenomena. It was such an amazing development. On the same day, he also discovered like charges repel and different charges come towards each other."}

This allows a dive bomber to drop bombs accurately on a relatively small target, or a moving target quite easily. Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges. This also had the advantage of attacking ships at a weak spot. A ship's armour was heaviest near the water. On the top of the ship, however, either the armour was very thin, or there was no armour at all. Also, dive bombing allowed relatively small aeroplanes carrying a limited bomb load to do more damage than usual.\nBecause of better bombsights and better anti-aircraft warfare after World War II, dive bombers were replaced by attack aircraft.

Fermi was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century.\nEarly life.\nFermi was born in Rome and went to a local grammar school. He was very good at maths and science and won a prize from Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa. He went to the University of Pisa where he studied physics. In 1923 he was given a scholarship from the Italian government and went to G\u00f6ttingen for more study. He was given a Rockefeller scholarship in 1924 and studied in Leyden. He came back to Italy at the end of 1924 and became Lecturer in Mathematical Physics and Mechanics at the University of Florence.\nScientist in Italy.\nIn 1926, Fermi discovered the statistical laws, now called Fermi statistics. These laws explain the actions of the particles which are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which are now called fermions. These are different to the particles called bosons which are explained by Bose-Einstein statistics. In 1927 he became Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Rome. He spent time studying electrodynamics, and began to closely look at the atomic nucleus. In 1934, using discoveries made by Wolfgang Pauli, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, he was able to show changes in almost every element bombarded with neutrons. This led to the discovery of slow neutrons, nuclear fission and making elements that were not in the Periodic Table.\nFermi expressed his concerns about the dangers of nuclear energy at one of the meetings of the University of Chicago before the end of the WWII."}

The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be measured for all substances of condensed matter (liquids and solid state). The linear thermal expansion can only be measured in the solid state and is common in engineering applications.\nThermal expansion coefficients for some common materials.\n The expansion and contraction of material must be considered when designing large structures, when using tape or chain to measure distances for land surveys, when designing molds for casting hot material, and in other engineering applications when large changes in dimension due to temperature are expected. The range for \u03b1 is from 10-7 for hard solids to 10-3 for organic liquids. \u03b1 varies with the temperature and some materials have a very high variation. Some values for common materials, given in parts per million per Celsius degree: (NOTE: This can also be in kelvins as the changes in temperature are a 1:1 ratio)\nApplications.\nFor applications using the thermal expansion property, see bi-metal and mercury thermometer\nThermal expansion is also used in mechanical applications to fit parts over one another, e.g. a bushing can be fitted over a shaft by making its inner diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the shaft, then heating it until it fits over the shaft, and allowing it to cool after it has been pushed over the shaft, thus achieving a 'shrink fit'\nThere exist some alloys with a very small CTE, used in applications that demand very small changes in physical dimension over a range of temperatures. One of these is Invar 36, with a coefficient in the 0.6x10-6 range. These alloys are useful in aerospace applications where wide temperature swings may occur."}

These points are usually, but not always, associated with positions on the surface of the Earth. They are often used to make land maps and boundaries for ownership of land. A person who does the surveying is called a surveyor. In order to find the information they need, surveyors use geometry, engineering, trigonometry, mathematics, physics, geology and law.\nSurveying has been very important in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history (ca. 5000 years ago) and it is a requirement planning of nearly every form of construction. Its most common uses are in the fields of transport, building and construction, communications, mapping, and the making of legal boundaries for land ownership.\nOrigins.\nSurveying has existed throughout much of our history. In ancient Egypt, when the Nile River overflowed its banks and washed out farm boundaries, the boundaries were recreated by surveyors using simple geometry. The construction of the pyramids, including the Great Pyramids of Giza (built c. 2700 BC) show us that the Ancient Egyptians used surveying efficiently.\nSurveyor.\nA surveyor is a person who has the skills to accurately find out the position of points and the distances and angles between them. These points are usually, positions on the surface of the Earth. Finding these points is called \"surveying\". Surveyors are needed to make land maps and boundaries for ownership of land. In order to find the information they need, surveyors use geometry, engineering, trigonometry, mathematics, physics, and law.\nThere are different types of surveyor. A construction or building surveyor is the person who has to make sure that buildings are being put up in the correct place and fit in with planning and building laws. A quantity surveyor is the person who keeps track of costs on a building project. A hydrographic surveyor measures points to do with water, such as rivers, lakes and oceans. A marine surveyor is a person who inspects ships. A mine surveyor is the person who finds out the position of underground mines, for example gold mines or coal mines."}

They have a son, Carl Maurice, born 1997.\nCareer.\nPolitical rise.\nLafontaine's political career began locally as mayor of Saarbr\u00fccken. He became widely known as a critic of chancellor Helmut Schmidt's support for the NATO plan to put Pershing II missiles in Germany. From 1985 to 1998 he was Minister-President of the Saarland. As minister-president, Lafontaine tried to keep the traditional industries of steel production and coal mining in the state with subsidies. He was also President of the Bundesrat in 1992/93.\nChancellor candidacy.\nIn the German federal election of 1990, Lafonntaine was the SPD's Chancellor candidate. The party lost because of support for the CDU who were the government during reunification. During the campaign he was attacked with a knife by a mentally deranged woman after a speech in Cologne. His carotid artery was slashed and he remained in a critical condition for several days.\nPolitical comeback.\nAt the \"Mannheim convention\" in 1995, Lafontaine was elected chairman of the SPD, replacing Rudolf Scharping. He was mainly responsible for bringing the whole of the SPD against Helmut Kohl and his CDU party, instead of cooperating with the CDU. Lafontaine said that any help given to Kohl would only help to keep the CDU in government.\nThis idea put the SPD ahead in the opinion polls in September 1998. He was appointed Federal Minister of Finance in the first government of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.\nMinister of Finance.\nDuring his short time as Minister of Finance, Lafontaine was a figure of attack by UK Eurosceptics. This was especially because he wanted to make taxes the same in the European Union. This would have meant some UK taxes would increase.\nOn 11 March 1999, he resigned from all his official and party offices, saying that not getting any help from other members of the cabinet. Later he become known for his attacks against Angela Merkel's government in the tabloid Bild-Zeitung which is generally considered conservative.\nThe Left Party.\nOn 24 May 2005 Lafontaine left the SPD. On 10 June, he said he would run as the lead candidate for The Left Party.PDS (Die Linkspartei), a coalition of the Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG), which is based in western Germany, and the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which was the successor to the East German communist party\nHe joined the WASG on 18 June 2005 and was selected to head their list for the 2005 Federal Election in North Rhine-Westphalia on the same day. He also stood in the Saarbr\u00fccken constituency, but lost. Nevertheless, the result of the Linkspartei in the Saarland was the best in any of the federal states in the West of Germany.\nCriticisms of Lafontaine.\nAn article by Lafontaine on Erich Honecker, state and party leader of the GDR and a Saarl\u00e4nder like him, in the magazine Der Spiegel was criticized by many people who said it concentrated on a few good things Honecker did, and ignored the bad things. In the late 80s and early 90s he lost some support from left-wing people because he seemed to want pro-business policies and he called for a reduction of the influx of Germans from Eastern Europe and asylum-seekers.\nBooks.\nOskar LaFontaine: \"The Heart Beats on the Left\" Polity, "}

It was discovered in 1989 by NASA's \"Voyager 2\" probe. Although it appears similar to Jupiter's spot, which is an anticyclonic storm (this is like a hurricane), it is believed that the Great Dark Spot is an atmospheric hole similar to the hole in Earth's ozone layer.\nHowever, the insides of Great Dark Spots are mostly cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter's spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be much shorter, forming and disappearing once every few years or so. Based on pictures taken by Voyager and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend a little bit more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot. \nCharacteristics.\nThe dark, elliptically-shaped spot (with initial dimensions of 13,000 \u00d7 6,600\u00a0km, or 8,100 \u00d7 4,100\u00a0mi) was about the same size as Earth, and was similar looking to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Around the Great Dark Spot, winds were measured blowing up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) an hour, the fastest in the Solar System. The Great Dark Spot is thought to be a hole in the methane cloud deck of Neptune. The spot was seen at different times with different sizes and shapes. \nThe Great Dark Spot generated large white clouds at or just below the tropopause layer similar to high-altitude cirrus clouds found on Earth. Unlike the clouds on Earth, however, which are made of mostly crystals of ice, Neptune's clouds are made up of crystals of frozen methane. And while Neptune's clouds usually form and then disappear within a period of a few hours, the clouds in the Great Dark Spot were still present after 36 hours, or two rotations of the planet.\nNeptune's dark spots are thought to happen in the troposphere at lower heights (or altitudes) than the brighter upper cloud deck features. As they are stable features that can last for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures.\nDisappearance.\nWhen pictures were going to be taken of the Great Dark Spot again in November 1994 by the Hubble Space Telescope, it had gone away completely, leaving astronomers to believe that it had either been covered up or that it had just disappeared. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer able to be seen as a dark feature. Dark spots may disappear when they move too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown way.\nHowever, a new spot that looked very much like the old spot appeared in Neptune's northern hemisphere. This new spot, called the Northern Great Dark Spot (NGDS), has remained able to be seen for several years."}

Speeds faster than 5 times the speed of sound are sometimes called hypersonic. Speeds where only some parts of the air around an object (like the propeller) reach supersonic speeds are called transonic (normally somewhere between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2).\nWhips have operated supersonically for many centuries. Artillery became supersonic in the 19th century.\nIt can be very hard to reach supersonic speeds, because drag increases a lot near these speeds. This slows a plane, and for years made control difficult. These problems were called the \"sound barrier\". Jet engines and other developments solved the problems in the middle 20th century."}

Although they were officially used to study just Jupiter and Saturn, the two probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system. They have since continued out and exited the solar system. These probes were built at JPL and were funded by NASA.\nBoth missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system, of which little was known before. In addition, the spacecraft paths have been used to place limits on the existence of Planet X, a planet believed by some people to be farther from the Sun than Pluto.\nIn 2013, NASA\u00a0announced that\u00a0Voyager 1\u00a0had left the solar system (Heliosphere) on 25 August 2012.

It is commonly used on astronomical telescopes to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion, or astronomical seeing. \nAdaptive optical works by measuring the distortion and rapidly compensating for it either using deformable mirrors or material with variable refractive properties. While the technique was theoretically understood for some time, it was only advances in computer technology during the 1990s that finally made the technique practical. \nAdaptive optics should not be confused with active optics, which works on a longer timescale to correct the primary mirror geometry itself. The simplest form of adaptive optics is tip-tilt correction, which corresponds to correction of the tilts of the wavefront in two dimensions (equal to correction of the position offsets for the image). This is performed using a rapidly moving tip-tilt mirror which makes small rotations around two of its axes. \nA significant fraction of the aberration introduced by the atmosphere can be removed in this way. Tip-tilt mirrors are widely used in night time and solar telescopes, to correct the aberration introduced by Earth's atmosphere on the light path and improve image quality over what would be possible according to the atmospheric seeing. \nTip-tilt mirrors are effectively segmented adaptive optics mirrors having only one segment which can tip and tilt, rather than having an array of multiple segments which can tip and tilt independently."}

When she was arrested, people suspected she was trying to hire a hitman to kill two men who were about to testify against her boyfriend Steven Spaliviero in court.\nCase.\nLindstr\u00f6m arrived in Sydney in 2003 working as a part-time model as well as a waitress in the exclusive nightclub Hemmesphere in Sydney.\nIn Sydney Lindstr\u00f6m met Steven Spaliviero and they soon started a relationship living in an apartment in Darling Harbour. Lindstr\u00f6m later told the court that she soon realised that he was both a rich businessman and a drug dealer. In early 2007, investigators started to look into Spaliviero's business and soon found two witnesses who said they had information about the man's drug dealing business. At that time Spaliviero was already on bail from Melbourne in relation to another drug case. Spaliviero was arrested, refused bail and sent to Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (\"MRRC\") in Silverwater, New South Wales.\nMurder plot.\nIn MRRC Spaliviero allegedly met another inmate who offered him to get witnesses in Spaliviero's case killed. In relation to this Spaliviero phoned Lindstr\u00f6m from MRRC telling her to meet a \"solicitor\" and give him money. \nLindstr\u00f6m started acting upon instructions from Spaliviero. When Lindstr\u00f6m finally met who she thought was a hitman, but who in reality was an undercover policeman, she was arrested. The policeman on the case stated that Lindstr\u00f6m wanted to have two men in the \"cemetery\" (i.e. dead). The price was agreed as AUD 100,000 for each contract.\nUpon her arrest on May 26 Lindstr\u00f6m was remanded in custody. Later an application for bail was made where Steven Spaliviero's mother, Dolores Spaliviero, offered to put up AUD 2,000,000 surety to get Lindstr\u00f6m out from custody. In addition, Lindstr\u00f6m's friend and employer, Justin Hemmes promising that if Lindstr\u00f6m was set free on bail, he would let her continue her work at the Hemmesphere nightclub until trial. The application for bail was denied due to flight risk and Lindstr\u00f6m was remanded in custody.\nOn September 18, having had a deal made with the prosecutors, Lindstr\u00f6m pled guilty to the charges. On December 21, she pled guilty again in another court in Sydney. Lindstr\u00f6m appeared in a bullet-proof vest at her court hearings because of the alleged death threats against her life.\nLindstr\u00f6m was initially sentenced to four years in jail being eligible for early parole on May 25 2009. Even though Lindstr\u00f6m was given a hefty discount from her sentence because she had agreed to testify against Steven Spaliviero and two other men, the Crown appealed against the sentence as \"manifestly inadequate\". The criminal court of appeals heard the appeal on July 4 2008.\nOn 23 July 2008 her maximum sentence was increased from three years and 10 months to four years and nine months, making her eligible for parole in May, 2010.\nOn August 11 2008 Lindstr\u00f6m started testifying against Spaliviero in his court case, among others reading a love letter to the court which she had written to him in February 2007 some months before her own arrest. Despite Lindstr\u00f6m's extensive testimonies Spaliviero and two other defendants were found not guilty for the murder plot.\nLindstr\u00f6m was released on parole from Long Bay jail in New South Wales on 25 May 2010 and deported the next day from Australia. Since her release from prison, Lindstr\u00f6m has returned to her native home Sweden and is understood to have had ongoing threats against her life.\nAccording to the Australian media, on 15 August 2010, Charlotte Lindstr\u00f6m agreed to return to Australia to testify in the trial of her former boyfriend's associate. Due to an unspecified severe illness, she has not been allowed to travel to Australia. The upcoming trial has been postponed.\nLatest development.\nOn 14 November 2010, Australian Channel 9 aired an exclusive interview of Charlotte Lindstr\u00f6m named \"Charlotte's web\", in which she appeared with her face unobscured despite allegations that she is living under death threats.\nOn 6 September 2011, Channel 9 in Australia aired a documentary concentrating on Charlotte Lindstr\u00f6m's murder plot. According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald Charlotte Lindstr\u00f6m \"no longer has feelings for\" Steven Spaliviero."}
