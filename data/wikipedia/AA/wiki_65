It was published in 1852. It greatly influenced many people's thoughts about African Americans and slavery in the United States. It also strengthened the conflict between the Northern and Southern United States. This led to the American Civil War. The book's effect was so powerful that Lincoln said when he met Stowe at the beginning of the Civil War, \"So this is the little lady who made this big war.\"\nThe main character of the novel is Uncle Tom, a patiente sentimental novel showed the effects of slavery. It also said that Christian love is stronger than slavery.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the most popular novel of the 19th century, and the second best-selling book of the century (the first one was the Bible). It helped abolitionism spread in the 1850s.\nIn these days, it has been praised as a very important help to anti-slavery. However, it has also been criticized for making stereotypes about black people.\nInspiration and references.\nHarriet Beecher Stowe was born in Connecticut. She was an abolitionist. Stowe wrote her novel because of the 1850 passage of the second Fugitive Slave Act. This law punished people who helped slaves run away. It also made the North stop and return the South's black runaways. Mrs. Edward Beecher wrote to Harriet (\"Hattie\"), \"If I could use a pen as you can, I would write something that will make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is.\" At that time, Stowe was a wife with six children who sometimes wrote for magazines. Her son, Charles Stowe, said that his mother read this letter out loud to her children. When she finished the letter, she stood up, and with \"an expression on her face that stamped itself on the mind of her child\", she said, \"I \"will\" write something...I will if I live.\" That is how \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" began.\nAccording to Stowe, she began thinking about \"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly\" as she was in a church in February 1851. She had a vision of a Christian black man being beaten and praying for the people who were beating him as he died. She was also partly inspired to write her novel by the autobiography of Josiah Henson. Henson was a black man who had run away and helped many black slaves. She was also helped by the book \"American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses\" by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimk\u00e9 sisters. Stowe also said that she got lots of ideas for Uncle Tom's Cabin by talking to runaway slaves when she was living in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nIn her book \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1853), Stowe wrote about the stories that inspired her when she was writing \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". However, later research showed that Stowe did not actually read many of the stories inside the book until after her novel was published.\nPublication.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" began in a series in an anti-slavery newspaper, \"The National Era\". \"The National Era\" had also printed other works Stowe had written. Because everybody liked the story so much, John P. Jewett of Boston asked Stowe to turn the serial into a book. Stowe was not sure if people would like to read the story as a book. However, she finally agreed. John Jewett, sure that the book would be popular, asked Hammatt Billings to engrave six pictures for the book. In March 20, 1852, the finished book came out. By June it was selling ten thousand copies a week. By October American sales alone were 150 thousand copies. In the first year it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold, and it was translated into many important languages.\nSummary.\nEliza's escape, Tom is sold.\nA Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby is afraid of losing his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife, Emily Shelby, are kind to their slaves, he decides to sell two of them: Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of his wife's maid Eliza. Emily Shelby is shocked and unhappy because she promised Eliza that she would not sell her son. George Shelby, her son, is unhappy because he admires Uncle Tom as his friend and Christian.\nWhen Eliza hears about Mr. Shelby's plans to sell her son, she decides to run away with her only son. She writes a letter saying sorry to Mrs. Shelby and runs away that night.\nMeanwhile, Uncle Tom is sold and put into a boat, which sails down the Mississippi River. There, he makes friends with a girl called Evangeline (\"Eva\"). When Eva falls into the water and he saves her, Eva's father, Augustine St. Clare, buys Tom. Eva and Tom become good friends because they both love Jesus very deeply.\nEliza's family hunted, Tom's life with St. Clare.\nDuring Eliza's escape, she meets her husband, George Harris, who had run away before her. They decide to try to run away to Canada. However, they are hunted by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Tom Loker finally traps Eliza and her family, so that George shoots Loker. Eliza is worried that Loker might die and go to hell. Because of this, she persuades her husband to take him to a Quaker town to get better. The gentle Quakers change Tom Loker greatly.\nIn St. Clare's house, St. Clare argues with his sister, Miss Ophelia. She thinks that slavery is wrong, but is prejudiced against blacks. St. Clare buys Topsy, a black child, and challenges Miss Ophelia to educate her. Miss Ophelia tries, but fails.\nAfter Tom has lived with St. Clare for about two years, Eva becomes very sick. She has a vision of heaven before she dies. Because of her death, many people change. Miss Ophelia loses her prejudice of black people, Tospy decides to become \"good\", and St. Clare decides to free Tom.\nTom's life with Simon Legree.\nSt. Clare, however, is hurt when he tries to stop a fight at a tavern and dies. Because of this, he cannot keep his promise to free Tom. His wife sells Tom to a plantation owner named Simon Legree. Legree takes Tom to Louisiana. There, he meets other slaves, including Emmeline (who Legree bought at the same time that he bought Tom). Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom disobeys his order to whip the other slaves. Legree beats him, and decides to destroy Tom's faith in God. However, Tom secretly continues to read the Bible and help the other slaves. At the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another black slave. Her two children had been sold, and she had killed her third child because she was afraid that her child would be sold, too.\nLoker has been changed because of the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have finally reached Canada and become free. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom feels so unhappy that he almost gives up, but he has two visions of Jesus and Eva. He decides to continue to be a Christian, even if he has to die. Cassy and Emmeline, with Tom\u2019s encouragement, run away. They cleverly use Legree\u2019s superstitious fears to help them. When Tom does not tell Legree where they are, Legree tells his men to beat him to death. Tom forgives the two men who beat him as he dies, and they feel sorry and become Christians. George Shelby comes just as Tom is dying to free him. He is very angry and sad. However, Tom, saying smilingly, \u201cWho,\u2014who,\u2014who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\u201d dies.\nImportant characters.\nUncle Tom.\nUncle Tom, the title character of the story, is a patient, noble, unselfish black slave. Stowe wanted him to be a \u201cnoble hero\u201d: in the book, he stands up for what he believes in. Even though they do not want to, even his enemies admire him.\nRecently, however, his name has also been used negatively. People often think of \"Uncle Tom\" as an old black man trying to make his masters happy, as people have criticized his quiet acceptance of slavery. However, others argue that this is not true. First of all, Uncle Tom is not really old - he is only eight years older than Mr. Shelby, which shows that he is probably around fifty. Also, Tom is not happy with slavery. His acceptance is not because of stupidity or because he likes slavery. It is because of his religious faith, which tells him to love everyone. Wherever Uncle Tom goes, he loves and spreads comfort and kindness. He helps slaves escape, such as Eliza, Emmeline and Cassy. He also refuses to beat other slaves. Because of this, he is beaten himself. Stowe was not trying to make Tom an example for \"blacks\" but for white \"and\" black people. She says that if white people were to be loving and unselfish like Uncle Tom, slavery would be impossible.\nEliza Harris.\nEliza Harris is Mrs. Shelby's favorite maid, George Harris' wife, and Harry's mother. Eliza is a brave, intelligent, and very beautiful young slave. Eliza loves her son, Harry, very much. It is possible her love for him was even greater because she lost two of her first infant children. Her motherly love is shown when she bravely escapes with her son. Perhaps the most well-known part of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is the part where Eliza escapes on the Ohio River with Harry.\nThis escape is said to have been inspired by a story heard in the Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. In Rankin's story, in February, 1838, a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley, Ohio with her child in her arms and stayed at his house before she had gone further towards the north.\nEva.\nEva \"Evangeline\" St. Clare is St. Clare and Marie's angelic daughter. She enters the story when Tom saves her from drowning when he was going to be sold. Eva asks her father to buy Tom. She says, \"I want to make him happy\". Through her, Tom becomes St. Clare's leading coachman and Eva's \"especial attendant (helper)...Tom had...orders to let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted him,\u2014orders which our readers may fancy (imagine) were far from disagreeable to him.\" She is very beautiful: \"Her form was the perfection of childish beauty...Her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of features than for a singular (strange) and dreamy earnestness (seriousness) of expression...all marked her out (made her different) from the other children, and made every one turn and look after her\".\nTo Tom, she \"...seemed something almost divine; and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered (looked) out upon him...he half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his New Testament.\" He says that \"She's got the Lord's mark in her forehead.\" Eva is an almost perfect, Christ-like child. She is very sad about slavery. She does not see the difference between blacks and whites. She talks very much about love and forgiveness. Even Topsy is touched by her love. Eva becomes one of the most important people in Tom's life.\nOphelia St. Clare.\nOphelia St. Clare is perhaps the most complicated female character in the novel. St. Clare calls her, \"...desperately ... good; it tires me to death to think of it.\" She does not like slavery. However, she does not like to be touched or come close to any black person as a human being. When she first saw Eva \"...shaking hands and kissing\" with the blacks, she declared that it had \"...fairly turned her stomach (made her feel sick).\" She adds, \"I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldn't have anything hurt; but as to kissing...How can she?\"\nShe has a \"clear, strong, active mind\", and is very practical. However, she has a warm heart, which she shows in her love for St. Clare and Eva. Ophelia hates slavery, but has a deep prejudice against blacks. St. Clare, as a challenge to her, buys Topsy. He tells her to try educating her. At first she tries to teach and help Topsy simply because of duty. However, Stowe says that duty is not enough: there must be love. Eva's death changes Ophelia. When Topsy cries, \"\"She\" said she \"loved\" me...there an't (is not) \"nobody\" left now...!\" Ophelia gently says, as \"honest tears\" fell down her face, \"Topsy, you poor child...\"I\" can love you, though I am not like that dear little child. I hope I've learnt something of the love of Christ from her. I can love you...and I'll try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl.\" Stowe thought that there were many people like Miss Ophelia St. Clare, who did not like slavery but could not think of blacks as people. She wanted to write about such problems through Miss Ophelia.\nImportant themes.\nSlavery.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"'s most important theme is the evil of slavery. Every part in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" develops the characters and the story. But most importantly, it always tries to show the reader that slavery is evil, un-Christian, and should not be allowed. One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how it forced families from each other.\nMotherhood.\nStowe thought mothers were the \"model for all of American life\". She also believed that only women could save the United States from slavery. Because of this, another very important theme of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is the moral power and sanctity of women. White women like Mrs. Bird, St. Clare\u2019s mother, Legree\u2019s mother, and Mrs. Shelby try to make their husbands help their slaves. Eva, who is the \"ideal Christian\", says that blacks and whites are the same. Black women like Eliza are brave and pious. She escapes from slavery to save her son, and by the end of the novel, has made her whole family come together again. Some critics said that Stowe's female characters are often unrealistic. However, Stowe's novel made many people remember \"the importance of women's influence\" and helped the women's rights movement later.\nChristianity.\nStowe's puritanical religious beliefs are also one of the biggest themes in the novel. She explores what Christianity is like. She believed that the most important thing in Christianity was love for everyone. She also believed that Christian theology shows that slavery is wrong. This theme can be seen when Tom urges St. Clare to \"look away to Jesus\" after St. Clare's daughter Eva dies. After Tom dies, George Shelby says, \"What a thing it is to be a Christian.\" Because Christian themes are so important, and because Stowe often directly spoke in the novel about religion and faith, the novel is written in the \"form of a sermon.\"\nStyle.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is written in a sentimental and melodramatic style. This style was often used in the 19th century sentimental novel and domestic fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time. It usually had female characters and a style that made readers feel sympathy and emotion for them. Stowe's novel is different from other sentimental novels because she writes about a large theme like slavery. It is also different because she has a man (Uncle Tom) as the main character. However, she still tried to make her readers have strong feelings when they read \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", like making them cry when Eva died. This kind of writing made readers react powerfully. For instance, Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the writer. In the letter, she said that \"I was up (awake) last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child.\" Another reader said that she thought about the book all the time and even thought about changing her daughter's name to Eva. The death of Eva affected lots of people. In 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston were named Eva.\nEven though many readers were very moved, literary critics did not like the style in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and other sentimental novels. They said these books were written by women and had \"women's sloppy (messy) emotions.\" One literary critic said that if the novel not been about slavery, \"it would be just another sentimental novel\". Another said the book was a \"piece of hack (messy) work.\" In \"The Literary History of the United States\", George F. Whicher called \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" \"Sunday-school fiction\".\nHowever, in 1985 Jane Tompkins wrote differently about \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in her book \"In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction.\" Tompkins praised \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"'s style. She said that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions changed the world in a good way. She also said that the popular domestic novels written in the 19th century, like \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", were intelligently written. She also said that \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" shows a \"critique of American society far more devastating (powerful) than any ... by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville.\"\nReactions to the novel.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has had a very great influence. There are not many novels in history that changed society so powerfully. When it was published, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", people who defended slavery were very angry and protested against it. Some people even wrote books against it. Abolitionists praised it very much. As a best-seller, the novel greatly influenced later protest literature.\nContemporary and world reaction.\nAs soon as it was published, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" made people in the American South very angry. The novel was also greatly criticized by people who supported slavery.\nA famous novelist from the South, William Gilmore Simms, said that the book was not true. Others called the novel criminal and said it was full of lies. A person who sold books in Mobile, Alabama had to leave town for selling the novel. Stowe received threatening letters. She even received a package with a slave's cut ear once. Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon began writing their own books about slavery.\nSome critics said that Stowe had never actually went to a Southern plantation and she did not know much about Southern life. They said that because of this, she made wrong descriptions about the South. However, Stowe always said she made the characters of her book by stories she was told by slaves that ran away to Cincinnati, Ohio, where she lived. It is reported: \"She observed firsthand (herself) several incidents (happenings) which ... [inspired] her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed (saw) on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the ... plot.\"\nIn 1853, Stowe published \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\". This was to show the people who had criticized the novel's description of slavery that it was true. In the book, Stowe writes about the important characters in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and about people in real life who were like them. Through this book, she writes a more \"aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had\". Like the novel, \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was also a best-seller. However, many of the works in \"A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was read by Stowe after she published her novel.\nEven though there were such criticisms, the novel was still very popular. Stowe's son says that when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln said, \"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\" Historians are not sure if Lincoln really said this or not. In a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln, she does not say anything about this sentence. After this, many writers have said that this novel helped make the North angry at slavery and at the Fugitive Slave Law. It greatly helped the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book made him help in the abolitionist movement.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" also interested many people in England. The first London edition came out in May 1852. It sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because at that time the British people did not like the United States. A writer said, \"The evil passions which 'Uncle Tom' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting (hurting) under the conceit of America \u2013 we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system \u2013 our Tories hate her democrats \u2013 our Whigs hate her ... All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy.\" Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, said later that, \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"; or \"Life among the Lowly\", published in 1852, influenced the world more quickly, powerfully, and dramatically than any other book ever printed.\"\n\"Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\" was published in Russia at the end of 1857 and was soon recognized as a classic of world literature. Many people saw a very strong link between the world of \"Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\" and the serfdom that still existed in Russia in 1850s. In his letter to an abolitionist Maria Weston Chapman, Nikolay Turgenev wrote, \u201cMany of the scenes described in the book seem like an exact depiction of equally frightful scenes in Russia.\u201d \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" served as an educational tool for Russian and Russo-Soviet elite in the post emancipation period, and it also became part of Soviet children literature.\nThe book has been translated into almost every language. For example, it was translated into Chinese. Its translator Lin Shu made this the first Chinese translation of an American novel. It was also translated into Amharic. Its 1930 translation was made to help Ethiopia end the suffering of blacks in that nation. The book was read by so many people that Sigmund Freud believed that some of his patients had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\nLiterary importance and criticism.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the first widely read political novel in the United States. It greatly influenced American literature and protest literature. Some later books that were greatly influenced by \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" are \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair and \"Silent Spring\" by Rachel Carson.\nHowever, even though \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was very important, many people thought the book was a mix of \"children's fable and propaganda\". Many critics called the book \"merely (only) a sentimental novel\". George Whicher wrote in his \"Literary History of the United States\" that \"Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous (great) vogue (popularity); its author's resources ... of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable ... melodrama, humor, and pathos \u2026 compounded (made up) her book.\"\nOther critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson said that \"To expose oneself in maturity (when one has grown up) to Uncle Tom's Cabin may \u2026 prove a startling (surprising) experience.\" Jane Tompkins said that the novel is one of the classics of American literature. She suggested that literary critics think badly of the book because it was simply too popular when it came out.\nThrough the years, people have wondered what Stowe was trying to say with the novel. Some of her themes can be seen easily, like the evil of slavery. However, some themes are harder to see. For example, Stowe was a Christian and active abolitionist, and put lots of her religious beliefs in her book. Some have said that Stowe wrote in her novel what she thought was a solution to the problem that worried many people who did not like slavery. This problem was: was doing things that were not allowed justified if they did it to fight evil? Was it right to use violence to stop the violence of slavery? Was breaking laws that helped slavery right? Which of Stowe's characters should be followed: the patient Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe thought that God's will would be followed if each (every) person sincerely (truly) examined his principles and acted on (followed) them.\nPeople have also thought \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" expressed the ideas of the Free Will Movement. In this idea, the character of George Harris symbolizes the free labor. The complex character of Ophelia shows the Northerners who allowed slavery, even though they did not like it. Dinah is very different from Ophelia. She acts by passion. In the book, Ophelia changes. Like Ophelia, the Republican Party (three years later) declared that the North must change itself. It said that the North must stop slavery actively.\nFeminist theory can also be seen in Stowe's book. The novel can be seen as criticizing slavery's patriarchal nature. For Stowe, families were related by blood, not by family-like relations between masters and slaves. Stowe also saw the nation as a bigger \"family\". So, the feelings of nationality came from sharing the same race. Because of this, she supported the idea that freed slaves should live together in a colony.\nThe book has also been seen as trying to show that masculinity was important in stopping slavery. Abolitionists began to change the way they thought of violent men. They wanted men to help stop slavery without hurting their self-image or their position in society. Because of this, some abolitionists followed some of the principles of women's suffrage, peace, and Christianity. They praised men for helping, working together, and having mercy. Other abolitionists were more traditional: they wanted men to act more forcefully. All the men in Stowe's book show either patient men or traditional men.\nCreation and popularization of stereotypes.\nRecently, some people have begun criticizing the book for what they thought were racist descriptions of the book's black characters. They criticized the way Stowe wrote about the characters' looks, speech, behavior, and the passive nature of Uncle Tom. The book's use of common stereotypes about African Americans is important because \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the best-selling novel in the world in the 19th century. Because of this, the book (together with images in the book and related stage productions) helped make a great number of people accept such stereotypes.\nAmong the African-American stereotypes in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" are:\nThese stereotypes made many people think much more lightly of the historical importance of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as a \"vital antislavery tool.\" This change in the way people looked at \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" began in an essay by James Baldwin. This essay was titled \"Everybody\u2019s Protest Novel.\" In the essay, Baldwin called \"Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\" a \"very bad novel\". He said it was not well-written.\nIn the 1960s and '70s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements strongly criticized the book. They said that the character of Uncle Tom was a part of \"race betrayal\". They said that Tom made slaves look worse than slave owners. Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time.\nHowever, people such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. have begun studying \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" again. He says that the book is a \"central document in American race relations and a significant (important) moral and political exploration of the character of those relations.\""}

Health care includes all reasonable and necessary medical aid, medical examinations, medical treatments, medical diagnoses, medical evaluations and medical services. The right to health care is considered one of human rights with international human rights law as well as social security.\nPrimary care.\nA primary care doctor (PCD) or primary care physician (PCP) is a doctor who provides general medical care. These doctors can answer health concerns and medical conditions a patient may have. They also can prescribe medicine for their patients, based on information gathered.\nCulture of health.\nIn 1968, Victor Skumin proposed the term \u2033Culture of Health\u2033, which has become widespread. The main task of a Culture of Health is to implement innovative health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual health. Holism is the idea that natural systems (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic, etc.) and their properties, should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts.\nAccording to Skumin, the culture of health is not only the mechanical connection of the two concepts\u2014the concept of \u2033culture\u2033 and the concept of \u2033health\u2033. This is their synthesis, which forms a new quality, a new content. Skumin examines the culture of health as the specific science, that develops the theoretical and practical tasks of harmonious development of the spiritual, mental, and physical human force, forming of optimum environment, which provides a higher level of creativity of life.

It formed in the southwestern Caribbean on November 4 after being in that area for a few days. After becoming a depression it quickly got stronger and became a tropical storm and a hurricane shortly before it struck Nicaragua. Over Central America, Hurricane Ida weakened very fast, becoming downgraded to a tropical depression before the end of the day on November 5.\nBy November 6, Ida went back into the Caribbean and later became a hurricane again. Its strength changed a few times before it died on November 10 off the coast of Alabama. Reports show that Hurricane Ida caused $5.6 million in damage and caused 2 deaths.\nStorm history.\nIda was tracked back to a tropical wave that entered the western Caribbean Sea on November 1. A low soon formed near the tropical wave. This low did not move very much and it also got a lot of clouds near the middle of it. There was hardly any wind shear, which allowed for more clouds to form. \nOn November 4, the tropical wave National Hurricane Center began call it Tropical Depression Eleven. The new tropical depression quickly got stronger and became Tropical Storm Ida soon after that. An Aircraft went into Ida and soon found winds at 65 miles per hour, which meant it was nearly a hurricane. \nContinuing to the northwest, Tropical Storm Ida was upgraded to Hurricane Ida when winds got to 80 miles per hour; at the time, it was put at only 75 miles per hour. Soon after this, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Nicaragua on November 5. Ida weakened quickly over land and was downgraded to a tropical storm just after landfall. Near the end of the day on November 5, Tropical Storm Ida weakened to a tropical depression. \nTropical Depression Ida survived its passage over land and went back into the Caribbean on November 6. Over the western Caribbean, it quickly became a tropical storm again. After moving north, Tropical Storm Ida became a hurricane again. &lt;ref name=\"update11/7/09\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its highest winds on November 8 while it crossed between Cuba and Mexico; they were measured at 105 miles per hour, making it a category 2 hurricane. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were not warm enough to keep Ida at this strength. so it quickly weakened back to a tropical storm. \nFor only six hours, it became a hurricane again before it became extratropical on November 10 while it was just south of Alabama. At the time, it looked like it stayed as a tropical storm and made landfall in Alabama, this was later noted as incorrect. Its remnants formed a strong nor'easter that affected some of the states of the East Coast of the United States.\nImpact.\nDamage in Nicaragua was near $2.1 million and there was not people killed. In El Salvador, it seemed at first that killed over 100 people, this was discovered as a mistake later on."}

It is in Agust\u00edn Ross Avenue, in front of Ross Park, in Pichilemu, Chile. The building was built in the late 1800s. In 1906 the first Chilean casino was built there. It was closed in 1932 and converted into a hotel which was open until the 1980s. The building is now Pichilemu's cultural centre.\nHistory.\nThe casino is named after Agust\u00edn Ross Edwards, a Chilean writer, member of parliament, minister and politician. He was part of the powerful family Ross Edwards, which founded the newspaper \"El Mercurio\" years earlier. Based on his european experience, Ross bought a place named \"La Posada\" (English: \"The Inn\") or Petren Fund in 1885. At that time, it was just some barracks with thick walls with a ground of 300 hectares.\nThe old Ross Casino was constructed in the late 1800s by Ross himself. It contained the first mail and telegraph service and a big store. The building had three floors, and was raised using imported materials. In January 20, 1906, the first Chilean casino was opened in that building. The Ross Casino worked until 1932, when the permission was cancelled, allowing just the newly constructed Vi\u00f1a del Mar Casino to work. After the closing of the Ross Casino, the building was converted into a hotel was which functioned until the 1980s.\nThe old casino (1905) and its gardens (1885) are an important part of the city. It was named Historic Monument by the National Monuments Council on February 25, 1988, by the supreme decree N\u00b0 100.\nRoss was also the administrator of the great Juana Ross de Edwards fortune, the Nancagua Hacienda, near the city of same name. He designed an urban set of high environmental value and landscape, transforming \"La Posada\" to a hotel (\"Great Hotel Pichilemu\", later \"Hotel Ross\", or \"Ross Hotel\"). \nRoss also built several chalets, terraces, embankments, stone walls, a balcony in front of the beach and several large houses with imported building materials and furniture from France and England. Additionally, he put up a park and a forest of more than 10 hectares. Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for rich people from Santiago. He, however, could not build a dock for the city, as he had planned. \nIn 1935, the Ross successors ceded to the Illustrious Municipality of Pichilemu all the Ross constructions (streets, avenues, squares, seven hectares of forests, the park in front of the hotel, the perrons and the terraces) under condition that the municipality hold them for recreation and public access.\nThe Cultural Centre was severely damaged after the February 2010 Chile earthquake. The library that it hosted was completely destroyed. After the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, the Cultural Centre suffered structural damage, but Roberto C\u00f3rdova, Mayor of Pichilemu, said that it was repairable."}

They are small passerine birds which belong to the family \"Passeridae\". They are also known as old-world sparrows. Sparrows often make their nests near houses or buildings. This means they are one of the easiest birds to see in the wild.\nThe genus has about 30 species around the world. The best known of these is the house sparrow, \"Passer domesticus\".\nSome authorities place other genera in the sparrow group: \"Petronia\", the rock sparrows; \"Carpospiza\", the pale rockfinch; and \"Montifringilla\", the snowfinches.\nDescription.\nSparrows are small birds. They are between 11\u201318 centimeters long. They can weigh between 13\u201342\u00a0grams. They are usually brown and gray. They have short tails and small, strong beaks. Most sparrows eat seeds or small insects. Sparrows are social birds and they live in flocks (groups)..\nThe house sparrow.\nThe house sparrow (\"Passer domesticus\") is a species of sparrow. It lives all over the world. It originally lived only in Europe and Asia. However, people travelled to new places and the house sparrow went to those places too. It is now the bird with the widest distribution. This means it lives in the most places. The species has about 50 subspecies.\nDistribution.\nSparrows can be seen on every continent on earth. A long time ago, they lived only in Europe, Asia and Africa. However, people traveled to Australia, North America and South America, and now sparrows are seen there too. The house sparrow is seen in every continent. In Australia, there are no sparrows in Western Australia, as they have not been able to travel across the deserts that separate that state from the eastern states. The government employs people to hunt and destroy any sparrows that might arrive.\nNorth America.\nThe house sparrow was introduced to America in the late 19th century. It was introduced on purpose. It was imported by several people, including Eugene Schieffelin, who was a wealthy New York City admirer of Shakespeare. He wanted to introduce to America all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Two of these species were great successes: starlings and house sparrows. He organized a society for the importation of foreign birds, incorporated in Albany.\nOther so-called 'sparrows'.\nSome ornithologists thought the \"Estrildid finches\" were in the same family as sparrows. However, they are now in a different family, the Estrildidae.\nThere is also a group called 'American sparrows', or New World sparrows. These are also in a different family, the Emberizidae (buntings).\nThe hedge sparrow (also known as the dunnock or accentor) \"Prunella modularis\" is also not a true sparrow. It is in a different family, the Prunellidae. It is only called a sparrow because people called all small brown birds 'sparrows'. Birdwatchers call then all LBJs (little brown jobs) because they are usually so difficult to tell apart.\nDescription.\nThe house sparrow is small bird. It is between 14\u201318 centimeters (5.5\u20137.1\u00a0in) long. It weighs between 24\u201339.5 grams (0.85\u20131.4\u00a0oz). Females are smaller than males.\nMale and female house sparrows are different colors. The male is brown, gray and white. It has a black throat. The female and young house sparrows are brown and dark yellow or cream. They have streaks (stripes) on their heads and wings.\nHabitat.\nThe house sparrow lives close to humans, often near human houses in towns or cities. It also lives near farms and makes a nest in a bush or small tree. It can have two or three broods per year. This means it has two or three sets of eggs and chicks each year.\nNest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.p52\u201357 A sparrow sometimes digs out its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches. More often it uses the nests of other birds, such swallows' nests in banks and cliffs, and old tree nest holes. It often uses deserted nests. Sometimes it takes over active nests by driving away or killing the occupants. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe. This puts the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters so the native bird population declines.\nConservation.\nThe number of house sparrows in the United Kingdom has gone down, perhaps because their hedgerow habitat has shrunk. They are now 'endangered' in the United Kingdom. However, in other countries, the bird is still very common. Hedges are necessary to the bird because predators cannot usually get at their nests. They would have no defence against magpies (for example) if face-to-face."}

It usually has a place to rest your arm on each side. Couches are normally found in the living room or in front of the TV.\nAlthough a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for reclining. In homes, couches are normally found in the family room, living room, den, sitting room or the lounge. They are also found in hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, furniture stores, etc. The term 'couch' is used in North America, Australia, New Zealand, whilst the term 'sofa' is generally used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The word originated in Middle English from the Old French noun couche, which derived from the verb meaning 'to lie down'.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, a couch was thought as a long, upward seat for resting on. One end would slope up high enough to provide a place for the head to rest. Some late 18th-century kinds of couches had an arm running partly down one side, and this type continued to be made in England. In Greek places, there were flowing designs with all kind of elegant colors. Many of them had scrolled ends and short legs. The couch was later taken over by the overstuffed sofa during the Victorian age.\nExpression.\nBecause the couch is usually set in front of the TV, it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it. Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time. This person, a person who does not do a lot of physical activity, was called a \"couch potato\". This was also because potatoes do not move at all, and does not do anything but just sits there. This may also be considered as slang. Couch came from the word \"couche\", which means, \"a bed, lair,\" or from the word \"coucher\", which means \"to lie down.\"\nTypes.\nThe most common types of couches in homes are the \"love seats\" for two, or the \"sofa\" for more than two. Other couches include the \"divan\" or the \"fainting couch\", which usually does not have a back. Couches are usually bought in a set together with cushions, which give them a bouncey and decorative comfortable touch. Most couches should be deep cleaned once or twice a year, but fabric furniture can sometimes need a little more, including vacuuming once a month and treating spills and stains as soon as they happen."}

He was the most important composer of French Grand opera during the 1830s and 1840s. Although he was tremendously popular in his day, his music is not often played now.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nMeyerbeer was born into a rich Jewish family in Tasdorf (now a part of R\u00fcdersdorf), near Berlin. His father owned large sugar refineries in Berlin and in Italy. His mother also came from a rich family. Her father had been important in Germany\u2019s struggle to be free of the French in 1812 when Napoleon was trying to conquer much of Europe. Giacomo\u2019s mother did a lot of good work trying to help people who were wounded during the Napoleonic wars.\nMany famous people came to the house where Giacomo\u2019s family lived. Some of the visitors were from the royal Prussian court, including the future King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. The naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt also visited them quite often.\nThe first piano teacher the boy had was Franz Lauska, who also taught the royal princes. He also had lessons in composition. Meyerbeer first played in public in 1801 playing Mozart's Piano Concerto in D Minor in Berlin. He wrote his first opera in 1810. In the same year he went to Darmstadt to study with the well-known music theorist Abb\u00e9 Vogler. There he met the young Carl Maria von Weber who was also a pupil of Vogler. He left Vogler in 1811 and tried to get some work in Munich. In 1813 he found he had been offered a job as court composer to the Grand Duke of Hessen. Vogler had probably recommended him for the job. At this time Meyerbeer was better known as a pianist than as a composer. He travelled to London to hear an important pianist based there, namely J.B.Cramer. There he met other famous pianists such as Kalkbrenner and Ferdinand Ries.\nItaly.\nIn 1816 Meyerbeer went to Italy. He wanted to learn about Italian opera and collect Italian folksongs. While he intended at first to stay only three months, he stayed most of the next nine years. He made some trips back to Germany and Austria during this time. He composed several operas which became very popular. People started to compare him with the famous Rossini. However, in Germany people were not interested in his music. He took his opera \"Il crociato in Egitto\" to London and then to Paris, where it was a success. The opera is remembered now for being the last opera ever to have a part for a castrato singer.\nHe was becoming well-known now. Spontini asked him to compose an opera for Berlin. He became friends, in Paris, with the librettist Eug\u00e8ne Scribe who had a lot of influence in the French theatre.\nThe Grand Operas.\nFrom 1825 onwards Meyerbeer spent his life travelling about Europe. He was often in Paris and in Berlin, but did not live in either of these places. He stayed in hotels or private houses wherever he went. One reason why he travelled was because of his health. His wife also had bad health, so they often went to spa towns to try to get better. He also travelled about to watch productions of his operas, and to hear young singers.\nWhen Carl Maria von Weber died, he left an opera, \"Die drei Pintos\", unfinished. It was sent to Meyerbeer in the hope that he would finish it, but he did not seem interested. In the end Mahler finished it many years later.\nMeyerbeer made changes to \"Il crociato in Egitto\" and turned it into a grand opera for the Op\u00e9ra in Paris. He changed it from an Italian to a French opera, composing extra dance music and a new overture. He was determined to be famous in Paris.\nIn 1826 he married his cousin. They had two children, but they both died when they were very small.\nIn 1828 Daniel Auber, a famous French composer of the time, had composed a very popular opera called \"La muette de Portici\". It was the first French grand opera. Meyerbeer realized he could not become really popular by turning his Italian operas into French grand opera, so he took his comic opera \"Robert le Diable\" and changed it into a grand opera. Audiences loved it. Within three years it had been performed in 77 theatres in 10 different countries. Many composers made their own arrangements of some of the tunes from the opera. He was given many honours: the Chevalier of the Legion d\u2019honneur, the title of Prussian Hof Kapellmeister (Director of Music at the Royal Court), and was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts and a member of the French Institute.\nMeyerbeer realized that anything else he wrote would have to be really good. In 1836 he produced another opera \"Les Huguenots\". This too was extremely popular.\nIn 1842 he went to Boulogne to improve his health. There he met Wagner who asked him for financial help to stage his operas \"Rienzi\" and \"The Flying Dutchman\". Meyerbeer lent him money, but stopped giving him money when he heard that Wagner was secretly criticizing him.\nBerlin years.\nWhen Spontini died Meyerbeer was made Generalmusikdirektor in Berlin. His opera \"Les Huguenots\" had at first been forbidden in Germany, but now it was allowed to be performed. As court composer he wrote a grand opera called \"Ein Feldschlag in Schlesien\" (\"A Battle in Silesia\"), but it never became internationally famous. The main part in the opera was sung by Jenny Lind.\nReturn to Paris.\nIn 1849 he returned to Paris. He wrote several works together with Scribe, whom Meyerbeer described as the best living librettist, and who was one of his closest friends. His opera \"Le proph\u00e8te\" (for which Scribe again wrote the words) earned him a lot of money. The great contralto Pauline Viardot-Garcia sang the main part.\nScribe died in 1861. Meyerbeer worked very hard to try to finish his last opera, \"L\u2019Africaine\". Napoleon III said he wanted the opera to be ready by the winter of 1862-63, but it was not ready until 1864. The work was being rehearsed for its first performance when Meyerbeer suddenly died, without having had the chance to revise it, the way he revised most of his other pieces.\nMeyerbeer\u2019s body was taken to Berlin where it was buried in the Jewish cemetery in a vault that belonged to his family.\nMeyerbeer\u2019s music.\nMeyerbeer was always more popular in France than in Germany. His operas are about the society of wealthy people. The sounds he made with his orchestra are often deliberately harsh. In this he is like Beethoven in his final years, and Berlioz. Sometimes he used new instruments such as the bass clarinet and the saxophone. He always thought carefully about what his singers were capable of when writing his music. He enjoyed working with different singers, among them Velluti, who was the last of the great operatic castrati. He took great trouble to give his singers rests during the opera so that they would still be in good voice for the climax of the story. He liked scenes with large crowds. He composed his dance music, in particular, very carefully. Often he would throw it away and start again if the dancers were not happy with it.\nBesides his operas he also wrote orchestral pieces for special occasions. He also wrote some songs for performance in the salon.\nMeyerbeer was one of the richest men in Europe. This is why some people hated him.\nMeyerbeer\u2019s reputation after his death.\nMeyerbeer\u2019s operas were very popular in the middle of the 19th century, but by the end of the century they had gone out of fashion.

It is his fate that he has keep sailing the sea, without ever going on to land, until Judgment Day.\nThe most important idea in the story as told by Wagner is redemption through love. It was a favourite idea of Wagner, who used it a lot in his later operas.\nWagner conducted the first performance at the Semper Oper in Dresden, in 1843. It is an early opera of Wagner, but it shows his mature style. It is very different from the previous opera \"Rienzi\" which is still quite similar to operas that other composers were writing. In \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" the drama is very important. Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs: musical ideas associated with particular characters and themes in the story. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture. We hear the famous leitmotif of the ocean and then those of the Dutchman and of Senta, the girl he falls in love with.\nWagner originally wrote \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" to be performed without any breaks (intermission).

It was Wagner's fifth opera. He worked on it between 1842 and 1845. It was first performed at the Dresden Royal Opera on 19 October 1845 with Wagner conducting. The opera was a success. It became hugely popular in Germany.\nIn 1859, \"Tannh\u00e4user\" was the first Wagner opera to be performed in the United States of America. By 1861, the opera had been performed many times in Germany when Wagner was asked to revise the work for the Paris Op\u00e9ra. Despite his best efforts, Wagner failed. He was not popular. Anti-Wagner riots broke out. He withdrew the work. It was not staged again in France until 1895. Meanwhile, the opera opened the second season of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in November 1884.\nBackground.\nWagner was in Paris completing \"The Flying Dutchman\" when he began thinking about writing another opera. A friend suggested Tannh\u00e4user as a subject. Wagner did not like the tale. Back in Germany however, he gathered materials by Tieck, Heine, and others about Tannh\u00e4user. Vacationing in Bohemia, he had a change of heart. He began preparing an outline for \"Tannh\u00e4user\". Returning home to Dresden, he immersed himself in the tale. He completed the opera in October 1845. He conducted the first performance that month at the Royal Opera House.\nHis Venus said, \"You are a genius, but you write such eccentric stuff that it is impossible to sing.\" His Tannh\u00e4user was completely baffled. The audience was puzzled. The reception was lukewarm. Wagner began revisions at once. The second performance played to a near empty house. In 1859, Wagner offered \"Tannh\u00e4user\" to the Paris Op\u00e9ra. They wanted it sung in French. They also wanted a ballet in the second act. This so the Jockey Club had time to finish dinner and arrive at the Op\u00e9ra just in time to ogle the dancers. Wagner refused to move the ballet from the first act to the second act. There were complaints. Jockey Club members interrupted the performance whenever possible. It was a disaster.\nThe opera disappeared from the French stage for 34 years. A few years after the Jockey Club incident, Wagner began revising the Paris version. He produced a sophisticated sound version that was superior to the first draft. Though there are several set pieces in the opera, the opera is closer to Wagner's vision of complete independence from such set pieces. \"Tannh\u00e4user\" is on the threshold of the leitmotif, and the diminishing of the sound power of the orchestra in favor of the sung word.\nSources.\nWagner's sources for the opera are spread over 600 year time span. In 1391, and again at the beginning of the 15th century, tales were in circulation about a paradise within a German mountain and a traveler who idles with a Sybil before heading to Rome for the Pope's forgiveness. The \"Song of Tannh\u00e4user\" of 1515 combines moralizing with the adventures of an historical Minnesinger named Danhuser, Tanhuser, or Tannenhauser. This Minnesinger's songs told of erotic love and its opposite, holy love.\nWagner was an insatiable reader, always on the alert for material that could be adapted to an opera. For \"Tannh\u00e4user\", he combined elements not only from traditional tales but material from C. J. L. Lukas's \"Essay\" (1838) on the character of Tannh\u00e4user and Ludwig Tieck's \"Faithful Eckart\" (1799). Ludwig Bechstein's \"Thuringian Legends\" (1835) included the story of the song contest. Wagner was familiar with the song contest through E. T. A. Hoffmann's \"Serapion Brothers\", Friedrich de la Motte-Fouque's drama \"The Singers Dispute in the Wartburg\" (1828), and Wagensil's \"Nuremberg Chronicle\".\"\nStory of the opera.\nThe story is about the struggle between sacred love and profane love, and redemption (salvation) through love. The story is based on the historical character of Tannh\u00e4user, about whom very little is known except the myths about him. It is also about the myth of Venus, but it also deals with the medieval Minnesinger (minstrel). Half of the opera takes place in a historical setting, and half takes place in the mythological Venusberg.\nCriticism.\nThe critics took Wagner to task for his historical inaccuracies. First, the real Tannhauser was only a boy at the supposed time of the song contest. Secondly, they regarded Wagner's Elisabeth with scorn: Wagner had made the character an amalgamation of several historical women.\nProduction.\nCuts to the original were made almost immediately because the singers were not capable of understanding and thus acting their roles. The Prelude to Act 3 was cut from 155 bars to 92. In the original final scene, neither Elisabeth or Venus appeared on stage. The audience was puzzled.\nThe original final scene was retained until the 13th performance in 1847. Wagner then recast the final pages to make Venus visible on stage. The Venusberg did not appear however. This new ending disturbed the audience because they were used to the older version. Wagner had also cut the pilgrim's chorus, further antagonizing the audience. Another version was made restoring the chorus.\nEarly productions.\nThe first performance outside Dresden occurred at Weimar. This production demonstrated to small theaters that they could stage the opera. Other productions took place in Schwerin, Breslau, Prague, Wiesbaden, and other small houses. The opera played in New York in 1859. It played in London (in Italian) in 1876. In Vienna, Johann Strauss performed excerpts in 1853. The first Austrian staging occurred at Graz in 1854. Vienna mounted the opera in 1857. The opera was performed at the Vienna court opera in 1875. In 1860, the Paris Opera wanted the work in a revised version in French. Wagner made extensive revisions for Paris."}

If this is not the case, the function is discontinuous. Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an \"uninterrupted line (or curve)\". They can be drawn \"without lifting the pen off of the page\". The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy.\nKarl Weierstra\u00df gave another definition of continuity: Imagine a function \"f\", defined on the real numbers. At the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2. If the function is continuous at formula_1, then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is, there is a value of formula_5, so that formula_6, means that formula_7. We can put this another way, given a point close to formula_1 (called x), the \"absolute value\" of the difference between the two values of the function can be made increasingly small, if the point x is \"close enough\" to formula_1.\nThere are also special forms of continuous, such as \"Lipschitz-continuous\". A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a formula_10 with formula_11 for all x,y \u2208 (a,b).\nA basic way to know if a function is continuous is to use a pencil or your finger. Then, start at the left of the function. Then, move your finger along the path of the function. If you ever need to lift your finger or pencil to keep following the function, then you know it is not continuous. This is because, by lifting your finger, you have \"jumped\" from one section of the function to another. That means you made a very small movement but the function changed very much. This is what the first sentence of this article is talking about."}

They are also called \"ginger ants\" and \"tropical fire ants\". They evolved in South America, but have become a major pest in North America. They are known for a painful sting. This sting uses a base, not an acid.\nInvasion.\nIn 1918, fire ants were accidentally moved into the United States of America by a ship from South America. They were moved in large amounts of dirt. The ships brought heavy things like machines from the US to South America. They brought back light things like crops. The dirt was ballast make the ships more stable. The dirt sometimes had fire ants in it.\nIn the United States, fire ants have no natural predators or competitors. They became an invasive species. Native animals are not adapted to these ants. Fire ants are very aggressive. Their colonies can have many queens unlike many other ant species. Because of this, fire ants have spread very fast. By 1965, fire ant mounds spread on the south eastern coast and as far west as Texas. Today they are found in at least 10 southern states. There is a separate group of fire ants living in California.\nJaws of damage.\nFire ants have done a lot of harm as they have spread across the United States. Because they are attracted to electrical currents, they chew through wires. This makes short circuits. Fire ants have also disturbed the natural balance of native ecosystems. In some places, they have killed off 70% of the native ant species and 40% of other native insect species.\nEach year, about 25,000 people go for medical help because of painful bites from fire ants. Fire ants attack in groups when disturbed. People often get many bites. Fire ant bites are usually not dangerous but some people are allergic to fire ants. They may go into shock. This is called anaphylaxis. This can kill them.\nFighting fire.\nThe fire ants are growing in the US 80 years after they came there. About 157 chemicals, like ammonia, gasoline, parts of manure, and insect-killing pesticides, are used against fire ants. However, none of them were very helpful. By 1995, the government had allowed only one fire-ant bait for people to use a lot."}

It consists of canons, fugues, ricercars and a trio sonata. All the music is based on a tune made up by King Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great). Bach dedicated the work to him.\nHow Bach composed the work.\nThe idea for this music started at a meeting between Bach and Frederick II on 7 May 1747. One of Bach\u2019s sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel, was one of the king\u2019s court musicians. The king wanted to show Johann Sebastian Bach a new instrument that had recently been invented. This was the piano. The king invited Bach to his palace at Potsdam.\nDuring the visit the king gave Bach a theme and asked him to write a 3 part fugue based on it. Bach was good at improvisation so he made up a 3 part fugue. The king wondered whether he could make up a 6 part fugue. That would be very difficult, and people thought he was joking, but Bach said he would think about it.\nTwo months later, after he had gone home to Leipzig, Bach made up a six-voice fugue based on the king\u2019s theme. He put it together with other compositions based on the theme and sent them to the king. This music became known as the \u201cMusical Offering\u201d. We do not know what the king thought of it.\nAt the top of the music Bach wrote some Latin words: \"Regis Iussu Cantio Et Reliqua Canonica Arte Resoluta\" (this means: \u201cthe theme given by the king, with additions, resolved in the canonic style\u201d). The first letters of these words spell out the word \"ricercar\", which was a form of music well-known at the time.\n\"The Musical Offering\" consists of a collection of ricercars, canons, fugues and a trio sonata. The trio sonata was written for flute, violin and basso continuo, but most of the other music does not show what instruments should play it. They are often played on keyboard instruments, or as chamber music by small groups of instruments. Bach did not show what order he wanted the pieces to be played in.\nRiddles.\nBach also put riddles at the top of some of the pieces. Some of these riddles have been explained, but some have more than one solution. One of these \"riddle canons\", \"in augmentationem\" (i.e. augmentation) has notes which get longer and longer. Bach wrote: \"Notulis crescentibus crescat Fortuna Regis\" (\u201cmay the fortunes of the king increase like the length of the notes\u201d). Another one is a modulating canon which ends a tone higher than it starts. Bach wrote over the music: \"Ascendenteque Modulationis ascendat Gloria Regis\" (\u201cas the modulation rises, so may the King's glory\u201d).\n20th century adaptations.\nSeveral composers have made arrangements of some of the music from the \u201cMusical Offering\u201d. In 1935, Anton Webern arranged Bach\u2019s six-part ricercar for orchestra. In 1980 Sofia Gubaidulina used the Royal Theme of the \"Musical Offering\" in her violin concerto. She turns the notes into a Russian Orthodox hymn."}

The term we use is derived from Mycenae, which is an important archaeological site about 90\u00a0km from Athens. Other important Mycenaean sites are at Athens, Thebes, Tiryns and Pylos. The epic poems of Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey, are Mycenaean in origin.\nThe earlier Minoans traded but did not conquer. The Mycenaeans traded and conquered.\nThe Mycenaean language.\nMycenaean is the oldest known form of the Greek language. It was spoken on the Greek mainland and on Crete in the Mycenaean period, 16th to 12th centuries BC. The language is written on clay tablets in a script called Linear B. Most of these tablets were found in Knossos in central Crete, and in Pylos in the southwest of the Peloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania in Western Crete. \nFor a long time no-one could translate the tablets. At last, in 1952 Michael Ventris deciphered the script. He showed that the language was an early form of Greek.\nThe texts on the tablets are mostly lists and inventories. There are no stories, myths or poetry, but they give us some idea of the people who made them.\nBy the late thirteenth century BC mainland Greece witnessed a wave of destruction. The Mycenaean sites declined, and the people moved to refuge settlements. This is the so-called Greek Dark Ages; little or no writing is found until the 8th century BC. See Ancient Greece for this and later periods.\nComparison with the Hittite language.\nOld Hittite and Mycenaean Greek are both Indo-European languages. The oldest Hittite texts are slightly earlier than the earliest Mycenaean texts, but Greek is the oldest surviving Indo-European language.\nIdentity.\nThe somewhat younger Linear B tablets suggest that the people called \"Mycenaeans\" might have been Achaeans. No written source found at a Mycenaean site reveals what they called themselves. In the \"Iliad\", the residents of the Peloponnesus and nearby islands are often called \"Achaeans\". There is mention of the \"Ahhiyawa\" in Hittite sources from the Late Bronze Age, which suggests itself that the Mycenaeans could possibly be \"Achaeans\". The \"Tawagalawa Letter\", written by an unnamed Hittite king (14th\u201313th century BC) to the king of \"Ahhiyawa\", treats him as an equal. The letter suggests that Miletus (\"Millawanda\") was under his control and refers to an earlier 'Wilusa' episode\" involving hostility by \"Ahhiyawa\". Ahhiya(wa) has been identified with the Achaeans of the Trojan War and the city of Wilusa with the legendary city of Troy. However the exact relationship of the term \"Ahhiyawa\" to the Achaeans is hotly debated by scholars, even after the discovery that Mycenaean Linear B is an early form of Greek. The written forms of the two languages are quite different."}

During the American Civil War, she was in charge of the agency to find missing Union soldiers. She also headed several hospitals in Virginia. She is best remembered for organizing the American Red Cross.\nChildhood of the Angel of the Battlefield.\nClara was born on December 25, 1821 in Oxford, Massachusetts. She was the youngest child of Sarah Stone and Stephen Barton. In her youth, Barton was timid and sensitive, which made household life difficult for Barton. \nClara's father was an important member of the town; he served as the town's moderator, ran a decent farm, and were well-known members of the town's church. Clara shared a special bond with her father. Both of them were adventurous and patriotic. Clara's father often told her stories about war, and they pretended to fight each other in fake battles.\nClara's mother was said to be a very beautiful woman. She was married at the age of seventeen, and by the time she was twenty she had already given birth to four children. She was very practical (good with her hands) and taught Clara many chores around the house. Her mother was strict and would not even let Clara have a toy doll. However, Clara's mother taught her many important things. She was a very strong and determined woman, and was full of common sense, traits that were both passed on to Clara.\nClara's four siblings were all older than she was. Her oldest sister, Dorothy, was seventeen years old when Clara was born; her oldest brother, Stephen, was fifteen; her younger brother, David, was thirteen; and her younger sister, Sally, was ten. She learned many skills from her siblings. Her sisters taught her how to read before she was even three years old. Stephen taught her mathematics, and David taught her how to ride a horse.\nAs a child, Clara liked to pretend she was a nurse. She took care of sick and injured animals. When she was eleven, her brother David fell off the roof of a barnhouse. This incident had a large effect on Clara, who helped nurse her brother. David suffered a severe injury to his head, and he was close to death for two years. For two years Clara took care of her brother, hardly leaving his bedside. She learned many medical practices, including bloodletting, giving medicine, and applying leeches. Though she didn't realize it, Clara had discovered her talent and love of nursing. After David was treated, Clara felt anxious and restless. She began becoming depressed because she had nothing to do. She tried being a weaver at her brother David's mill, but she quit and looked for a new job.\nEarly careers.\nTeaching.\nOne day, a phrenologist visiting the Barton household told Barton's parents to teach in a school so she could overcome her extreme shyness. Barton was first terrified of this, but she soon taught a class of forty girls and boys in a local school. Barton impressed the children, who were barely younger than she was, and she felt happy at earning their respect. After her school received an award for discipline, Barton received many job offers. She asked for and received the same pay for teaching as male teachers, which was uncommon at the time. Barton taught at the school for ten years.\nWhen she was thirty, Barton enrolled at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. After graduating, two schoolmates, Charles and Mary Norton, invited her to live with their family in Hightstown, New Jersey. Barton began teaching in the local school, and then began starting free public schools like the ones in Massachusetts. The school was very successful, and many new teachers were hired and a new building was built. A man was hired to run the school, and he received a salary almost twice as high as Barton's salary. Barton was angry at this treatment, and she left to find a new job in Washington D.C.\nWashington D.C..\nBarton spent the next five years of her life in the US capital, her first job being a clerk for the government. Department of the Interior records say that she became a clerk in 1855, which makes her the first female to work for the government. Barton was appointed a position in the US patent office. She even received the same pay as the other workers, receiving $1400 a year. The other workers were very angry about this; they \"spat on the floor\", \"blew smoke in her face\", insulted her, and made slanderous remarks about her. Many of these men lost their jobs because of this behavior.\nLater life and death.\nBarton quit working and lived in Glen Echo, Maryland. She wrote a book about herself called \"The Story of My Childhood.\"\nShe died at the age of 91 years old from Tuberculosis on April 12, 1912.\nNotes.\nMore!!!!"}

For example, a solid may become a liquid. This phase change is called melting. When a solid changes into a gas, it is called sublimation. When a gas changes into a liquid, it is called condensation. When a liquid changes into a solid, it is called solidification. When a gas changes into a solid, it is called deposition . When a liquid changes into gas, it is called evaporation. Phase changes are usually caused by changes in temperature or pressure.\nAs the states of matter change from solid to liquid to gas, respectively, their composition changes as well. For example, in a solid, the bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds. That allows the solid substance to have a definite volume and shape. However, when the heat is added to the solid and it melts to become a liquid, the bonds are considerably weaker, and in water, are simply hydrogen bonds. A liquid has a definite volume but not a definite shape, and it thus takes the shape of the container in which it is. When \"more\" heat is added, the liquid substance evaporates and becomes a gas, which has no bonds at all. Gas is simply a formless collection of particles that tends to expand in all directions at the same time in order to occupy its full container. If a gas is not confined, the space between the particles will continue to increase. A gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. \nIn this pattern, solid to liquid to gas, heat is being added in order to provoke the phase change. In the other \"direction,\" gas to liquid to solid, heat is being released through the phase change. \nIt often helps to think of an ice cube when thinking of phase changes. An ice cube is a solid, and when heated up, it becomes liquid water. When heated up some more, it becomes water vapor, which is a gas."}

Secret Service agents work as bodyguards and protect people like the President, Vice President, members of the United States Cabinet, people who are running for high office, and the family members of these people, and leaders from other countries who are visiting the United States. There are other people whom the Secret Service protects, too. A United States President would never be seen in public without Secret Service agents protecting him or her at all times.\nIt is often not easy to recognize Secret Service agents, because they often dress to blend in wherever they are. This means that they will often be dressed the same way as everybody else in a crowd.\nThey employ about a total of 5,000 people.\nHistory.\nThe United States Secret Service was created in 1865 to stop counterfeiters. It did not start protecting the President until after President William McKinley was shot and killed in 1901. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt became the first President of the United States to be protected by Secret Service agents. Since then, every president has received Secret Service Protection. In 1981 when Ronald Reagan was shot, Timothy McCarthy became one of four Secret Service agents to take a bullet of a President.\nThe Secret Service used to be part of the Treasury Department, but is now part of the Department of Homeland Security."}

She is best known for working with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for seven years using the ring name Kelly Kelly. During her time in WWE she was a one time WWE Divas Champion. Kelly Kelly used to have a weekly segment known as Kelly's Expos\u00e9 where she would dance for the WWE Universe.\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment / WWE.\nOhio Valley Wrestling (2006).\nIn 2006, while working as a model, Blank was seen by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) official John Laurinaitis, who was interested in signing her to a contract. As a result, WWE contacted her modeling agency and invited her to their developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), for a try-out. Despite having no previous wrestling experience she was offered a contract, which she signed in May 2006. Even after being called up to the main roster she continued to fly back and forth to OVW's base city Louisville, Kentucky once a week to work shows; first as a ring announcer and referee, then as a wrestler. One of her first matches took place at the September 6 OVW TV tapings where she participated in a Women's battle royal won by ODB.\nECW (2006\u20132008).\nBlank debuted for the ECW brand as Kelly Kelly. Originally, she was to be named just 'Kelly', but her ring name was expanded to 'Kelly Kelly' by Vince McMahon. She made her debut on the first episode of the weekly television program on June 13, 2006, becoming the youngest Diva on the WWE roster. Her character, an exhibitionist, was introduced performing a striptease for the crowd. The next week, while performing another striptease, Kelly was interrupted by her on-screen boyfriend, Mike Knox, who came to the stage and covered her with a towel before dragging her backstage. Her stripping became a weekly segment known as \"Kelly's Expos\u00e9\" and usually followed the same routine; Kelly would dance and strip until she was interrupted by Knox who was upset by her exhibitionism and showing off her body to others. Knox began forcing Kelly to accompany him to ringside so he could keep an eye on her, making her his \"de facto\" valet. As a result, she found herself involved in the feud developing between Mike Knox and partner Test with Tommy Dreamer and his partner The Sandman, including being inadvertently hit with a cane by Sandman when Knox used her as a shield. She made her ECW in-ring debut on the August 22, 2006 episode of \"ECW on Sci-Fi\" in a losing effort as part of a six-person mixed tag team match which saw herself, Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.\nFollowing this feud, Kelly and Knox were moved into a storyline with CM Punk in September, in which Kelly was shown to have developed a liking for Punk and Knox was shown to be increasingly protective and jealous. During the next month, Kelly continuously flirted with Punk and was shown watching his matches from the crowd, until Knox stopped her. Subsequently, Kelly's character dressed as Punk for ECW's Halloween Costume Contest, enraging Knox and leading to a match between the two, during which Kelly cheered for Punk. At December to Dismember, Kelly and Knox took on the team of Ariel and Kevin Thorn in a mixed tag team match, during which Knox refused to tag in before abandoning Kelly, leaving her to be beaten badly by Ariel. On the following episode of \"ECW\", Kelly defeated Ariel with a roll-up on her first ECW singles match, after which Knox made his way to the ring with flowers only to throw them in Kelly's face and perform his signature swinging reverse STO on her, ending their relationship and giving her a scripted injury\u2014removing her from the program for six weeks.\nShe returned to television on January 16, 2007 and cut a promo announcing she was newly single and bringing back \"Kelly's Expos\u00e9\". The following week, she joined forces with Layla and Brooke to form Extreme Expos\u00e9. The trio performed a weekly dance segment on \"ECW\" for the next several months, as a successor to Kelly's Expos\u00e9 segment. In June 2007, The Miz was moved to the brand, prompting a storyline in which all three members of Extreme Expos\u00e9 were attracted to him. When Kelly shifted her attentions towards Balls Mahoney, Layla, Brooke, and The Miz openly mocked her, and The Miz later prevented her from going on a date with Mahoney, stating that he owned her contract and would fire her if she did so. On November 1, Brooke was released from her WWE contract, and Extreme Expos\u00e9 dissolved as a group, leaving Kelly and Layla to enter an ongoing rivalry with more active wrestling roles. On the October 29 episode of \"Raw\", Kelly won a battle royal to earn a match against the WWE Women's Champion, Beth Phoenix. After the match however, Kelly was attacked by Phoenix and lost the subsequent match between the two the following week on \"Raw\". Kelly continued to feud with Layla, and they were on opposite sides of a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, which Kelly's team won. In December, Layla formed an alliance with Victoria, which expanded to include Lena Yada in January 2008, and Kelly continued to feud with the trio. At WrestleMania XXIV, Kelly was a 'lumberjill' for the Divas' tag team lumberjill match.

Leeroy\u2019s name is often spelt wrong as Leroy Jenkins who is a real different person.\nThe video which made Leeroy so famous shows him and his friends, doing a friendly activity known as a Raid in World of Warcraft, but this activity is hard to do, so the leader of the group that Leeroy is with has to explain what to do. But Leeroy is not around for the explanation, preparing some chicken, and when he comes back, he ends up running in the area, shouting his own name as he goes, which begins the activity, and ruining the plan which his friends made. This causes everyone to panic, and no-one knows what to do, and so, everyone dies. Everyone blames Leeroy for this, and he says \"At least I got chicken.\"\nLeeroy has become very well known and his name is now used by people to show that they are running in but have no idea what to do. These people should be avoided, as they may cause you to die as well, as the video shows. Because of this, people now consider the video to be a lesson."}

Her novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1852) showed the lives of African-Americans slaves. It was very popular as a novel and a play, and had a great influence in the United States and Britain, helping people who did not like slavery and making many people disagree with slavery.\nBiography.\nStowe was born Harriet Elisabeth Beecher in Litchfield, Connecticut, on June 14, 1811. Her parents were religious leaders Lyman Beecher (a leader of the Second Great Awakening) and Roxana (Foote) Beecher. Her mother died when Harriet was five years old. She had a sister, Catharine Beecher, who was an educator and author, and three brothers Henry Ward Beecher, Charles Beecher, and Edward Beecher.\nHarriet went to the girls' school run by her sister Catharine. She received an education in the classics, including study of languages and mathematics. At 21, she moved to Cincinnati, Ohio to join her father. He had become the president of Lane Theological Seminary. She also joined the literary salon and social club called the Semi-Colon Club.\nHarriet married Calvin Ellis Stowe on January 6, 1836. He was a widower and professor at the seminary. They had seven children together, including twin daughters. Calvin Stowe was a critic of slavery. The Stowes supported the Underground Railroad. They briefly sheltered several fugitive slaves in their home.\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and the American Civil War.\nIn 1850, the Stowe family moved to a house near the campus of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Calvin Stowe was teaching in the college. On March 9, 1850, Stowe wrote to the editor of the antislavery journal \"National Era\". She told him that she was planning to write a story about slavery. In June 1851, the first installment of her book, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", was published in the \"National Era\". She originally used the subtitle \"The Man That Was A Thing\". It was changed to \"Life Among the Lowly\". Installments were published every week from June 5, 1851, to April 1, 1852.\nFor the newspaper serialization (published in parts) of her novel, Stowe was paid only $400. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was published in book form on March 20, 1852, by John P. Jewett with an initial print run of 5,000 copies. Each of its two volumes included three illustrations and a title-page designed by Hammatt Billings. In less than a year, the book sold an unprecedented 300,000 copies. By December 1851, sales began dropping off. A cheap edition was published to stimulate more sales.\nAmericans were captivated by the book. It provoked more debate about abolition and slavery. Southerns hated the book. Within a year of the book's publication, 300 babies were named \"Eva\" in Boston alone.\nLincoln and Stowe.\nAfter the start of the American Civil War, Stowe went to Washington, D.C. She met President Abraham Lincoln on November 25, 1862. Stowe's daughter Hattie reported, \"It was a very droll time that we had at the White House I assure you ... I will only say now that it was all very funny\u2014and we were ready to explode with laughter all the while.\"\nLincoln greeted Stowe by saying, \"So this is the little lady who made this big war.\"\nHarriet's own accounts are vague, including a letter reporting the meeting to her husband: \"I had a real funny interview with the President.\"\nDeath.\nHarriet Beecher Stowe died on 1 July 1896 in Hartford, Connecticut. She is buried in the cemetery at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts."}

That is, formula_5 for a positive formula_1, formula_7 for a negative formula_1, and formula_9 \nFor example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of \u22123 is also 3 (formula_10). The absolute value of a real number may be thought of as its distance from zero. It can be defined as follows:\nBecause a distance is always positive, the absolute value of a number is always positive.\nSimilarly, the absolute value of a complex number may be thought of as its distance from the origin.\nIt is defined by the equation \nProperties of the absolute value.\nReal numbers.\nFor any real number formula_13, the absolute value of formula_13 is denoted by (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity), and is defined as\nThe absolute value of formula_13 is always either positive or zero, but never negative. From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's distance from zero along the real number line. The absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them.\nIn calculus, the absolute value function is differentiable except at 0. It is continuous everywhere.\nIn linear algebra, the norm of a vector is defined similarly as the distance from the tip of the vector to the origin.

Gaga played the female lead, Ally, in the 2018 movie \"A Star Is Born\", where she stars alongside Bradley Cooper. She additionally portrays Patrizia Reggiani in the 2021 Ridley Scott film, \"House of Gucci\".\nLife and career.\n1986\u20132004: Early life.\nLady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta at Lenox Hill Hospital Northwell Health in Upper East Side, New York City, on March 28, 1986. She is the oldest child of Joseph Germanotta, an internet businessman, and Cynthia (n\u00e9e Bissett). She has a younger sister named Natali, who is a fashion student. Lady Gaga is of Italian (her paternal grandfather was from Naso, in the province of Messina and he came up to the United States on 1908) and French Canadian ancestry. She learned to play piano at the age of four. She wrote her first piano song at 13. She started performing live by age 14. At the age of 11, Gaga went to the Convent of the Sacred Heart. This is a private Roman Catholic school on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Her family wasn't rich. She has said that her parents \"both came from lower-class families, so we've worked for everything my mother worked eight to eight out of the house, in telecommunications, and so did my father.\" In high school, Gaga played lead roles in \"Guys and Dolls\" and in \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\". Gaga said her high school life was \"very dedicated, very studious, very disciplined\". She also said that it was \"insecure\". She said in an interview that, \"I didn\u2019t fit in, and I felt like a freak.\"\nGaga was 17 when she went to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She lived in a NYU dorm on 11th Street. She studied music. She helped to write essays on art, religion, social issues and politics. Gaga felt that she was more creative than some of her classmates. \"Once you learn how to think about art, you can teach yourself,\" she said. By the second semester of her sophomore year, she left school to focus on her musical career. Her father agreed to pay her rent for a year, if she agreed to go back to Tisch if she failed. \"I left my entire family, got the cheapest apartment I could find, and ate shit until somebody would listen,\" she said. Gaga has said she has had bulimia and anorexia since she was 15.\n2005\u201307: Career beginnings.\nIn 2005, Gaga began a band called the Stefani Germanotta Band.

He modeled the Blue Dog after his own pet named Tiffany. She had died a couple years before the first painting was ever made. That first painting was made for the cover of a scary book.

It is a form of water pollution.\nSources of ocean pollution.\nMarine pollution\u00a0occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals,\u00a0particles,\u00a0industrial, agricultural and residential\u00a0waste, noise, or the spread of\u00a0invasive organisms. Most sources of marine pollution are land based. The pollution often comes from\u00a0nonpoint sources such as agricultural\u00a0runoff, wind-blown debris and dust.\u00a0Nutrient pollution, a form of\u00a0water pollution, refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of\u00a0eutrophication\u00a0of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually\u00a0nitrogen\u00a0or\u00a0phosphorus, stimulate algae growth.\nMany potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by\u00a0plankton\u00a0and\u00a0benthos\u00a0animals, most of which are either deposit or\u00a0filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are\u00a0concentrated upward\u00a0within ocean\u00a0food chains.\nWhen pesticides are incorporated into the\u00a0marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine\u00a0food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web.\nToxic metals\u00a0can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many\u00a0animal feeds\u00a0have a high\u00a0fish meal\u00a0or\u00a0fish hydrolysate\u00a0content. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products. \nEvery time we wash a car or use fertilizer on our lawns we are polluting the ocean. People often think that water pollution comes from big factories, but most of the pollution comes from everyday people doing everyday things. This kind of pollution is called \"nonpoint-source pollution\" because we cannot point out where it came from directly. All waste water, in time, enters a body of water (usually a stream). Every stream leads to a river, and every river leads to an ocean.\nOil spills.\nBecause so many people use oil, large ships must take billions of barrels of it across the oceans. If it is not handled carefully, these trips can be very bad. In 1989, the United States experienced a large oil spill in Prince William Sound, a waterway on the Alaskan coast. The \"Exxon Valdez\", a very big ship, hit a reef and spilled more than 260,000 barrels of oil. The results were very bad. A great number of animals were covered in oil and began dying immediately. Animals that ate these oil-filled animals also died. Many Alaskans who lived by fishing these animals lost their businesses. Even though many animals were saved, and the Exxon Oil Company spent 2.5 billion dollars trying to clean up the oil, Alaska's wildlife still suffers.\nOcean Pollution\nOceanic pollution is the process where harmful or potentially harmful substances get into the ocean where they affect the existence of the sea organisms. Most of the harmful materials such as industrial, agricultural wastes as well as air pollution come from land. Pollutants get into the ocean through rivers from urban centers sewage and drainage systems. In the land runoffs, the pollutants include soil from farms, agricultural chemicals such as fertilizers, constructions as well as mining fields that are carried into the ocean by the rain or river water. All these pollutants are consumed by fish and other sea animals and eventually ending up in the fish we eat. The accumulation of these chemicals in the bodies of human beings can cause serious health issues. In order to reduce ocean pollution, tighter regulations should be placed on industries and sewage to ensure that the wastes of the industries are treated before being let into the rivers.\u00a0\nSaving the ocean.\nHumans have done much to harm the ocean, but we are starting to try to help them. Countries promise each other to clean up the ocean and save the ocean's resources."}

Hats, hoods, and other headdresses assumed increasing importance, and were swagged, draped, jewelled, and feathered. Full-bodied houppelandes with voluminous sleeves worn with elaborate headdresses are characteristic of the earlier 15th century.\nAs Europe continued to grow more prosperous, the urban middle classes, skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites. National variations in clothing seem on the whole to have increased over the century. \nWool was the most popular fabric for all classes by far, followed by linen and hemp. Wool fabrics were available in a wide range of qualities, from rough undyed cloth to fine, dense broadcloth with a velvety nap; high-value broadcloth was a backbone of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe. Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours, notably reds, greens, golds, and blues, although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with woad (and less frequently indigo) could not match the characteristic rich lapis lazuli pigment blues depicted in contemporary illuminated manuscripts such as the Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry.\nSilk-weaving was well-established around the Mediterranean by the beginning of the century, and figured silks, often silk velvets with silver-gilt wefts, are increasingly seen in Italian dress and in the dress of the rich throughout Europe. Stately floral designs featuring a pomegranate or artichoke motif had reached Europe from China in the previous century and became a dominant design in the Ottoman silk-producing cities of Istanbul and Bursa, and spread to silk weavers in Florence, Genoa, Venice, Valencia and Seville in this period. \nFur was worn, mostly as a lining layer, by those who could afford it. The grey and white squirrel furs of the Middle Ages, vair and miniver, went out of style except at court, first for men and then for women; the new fashionable furs were dark brown sable and marten. Toward the end of the century, wild animal furs such as lynx became popular. Ermine remained the prerogative and hallmark of royalty."}

Markov chains are called that because they follow a rule called the Markov property. The Markov property says that whatever happens next in a process only depends on how it is right now (the state). It doesn't have a \"memory\" of how it was before. It is helpful to think of a Markov chain as evolving through discrete steps in time, although the \"step\" doesn't need to have anything to do with time.\nMarkov chains can be discrete or continuous. Discrete Time Markov Chains are split up into discrete time steps, like t = 1, t = 2, t = 3, and so on. The probability that a chain will go from one state to another state depends only on the state that it's in right now. Continuous Time Markov Chains are chains where the time spent in each state is a real number. The amount of time the chain stays in a certain state is randomly picked from an exponential distribution, which basically means there's an average time a chain will stay in some state, plus or minus some random variation.\nAn example of a Markov chain are the dietary habits of a creature who only eats grapes, cheese or lettuce, and whose dietary habits conform to the following (artificial) rules:\nThis creature's eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice depends on what it ate yesterday, not additionally on what it ate 2 or 3 (or 4, etc...) days ago. One statistical property one could calculate is the expected percentage of the time the creature will eat cheese over a long period.\nAnother classical example of a Markov chain is the 1995 model of cocaine use in Los Angeles designed by the . The model is governed by a series of equations, which describe the probability of a person being a non-user, light user (L) or heavy user (H) of cocaine at time \"t\"+1, given their prior probabilities at time \"t\":\n\"L(t+1)\" = \"I\"(\"t\")\"-aL(t) +fH(t)-bL(t)\"\n\"H(t+1)\" = \"bL(t)-fH(t)-gH(t)\"\n\"I(t)\"+\"L(t)\"+\"H(t)\"=1"}

She earned her living finding and preparing fossils, in the rich Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis, Dorset where she lived. She made many important finds. These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be correctly identified (\"Temnodontosaurus platyodon\"); the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found (\"Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus\"); the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany (\"Dimorphodon macronyx\"); and some important fish fossils.\nHer observations played a key role in the discoveries that belemnite fossils contained fossilized ink sacs, and that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilized faeces. When the geologist Henry De la Beche painted \"Duria Antiquior\", he based it largely on fossils Anning had found. He sold prints for her benefit. Her work played a key role in the growth of scientific biology in the early 19th century. It showed without question that previously unknown forms of life had existed in the Jurassic seas, all of which were long extinct.\nAnning's sex and social class\u2014her parents were poor religious dissenters (non-Anglican Protestants)\u2014prevented her from fully participating in the scientific community of early 19th century England, dominated as it was by rich Anglican gentlemen. Some of the men she worked with and for did give her full credit for her contributions, but some did not.\nAlthough she became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and she made a great deal of money from her best finds, she struggled financially for much of her life. In 1818 Anning came to the attention of Thomas Birch, a rich fossil collector, when she sold him an ichthyosaur skeleton. A year later, he was disturbed by the poverty of the Anning family, which was at the point of having to sell their furniture to make ends meet. Birch arranged for the sale by auction of his own fossil collection, and the proceeds (some \u00a3400) were given to the Annings. Besides providing much needed funds, the public auction raised the profile of the Anning family in the geologic community. Later, she lost \u00a3300 (a huge sum) in 1835 on unwise investments, but was saved by a government pension of \u00a325 per year. This was organised by another of her friends, William Buckland. Her early death was caused by breast cancer.\nThe fossil shop.\nTourists used to visit Lyme Regis, which had become a popular seaside resort. As their father had before them, Mary and her brother Joseph Anning set up a table of 'curiosities' near the coach stop at a local inn to sell their wares to tourists. After Joseph made an important find of an ichthyosaur skull in 1810 and Mary found the associated skeleton a year later, they became known to the geologists and amateurs interested in fossils. Their passion for fossils grew to be the main source of income for their family.\nHer stock in trade were invertebrate fossils such as ammonite and belemnite shells, which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings. Vertebrate fossils were much rarer, and exceptional specimens like an almost complete ichthyosaur skeleton could sell for much more.\nThe source of these fossils were the coastal cliffs that surround Lyme which are part of a geological formation known as the Blue Lias. This formation consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210-195 million years ago). The cliffs are one of the richest fossil locations in Britain.\nAs Mary Anning continued to make important finds her reputation grew. In 1826, at the age of 27, she managed to save enough money to buy a home with a glass store front window for her shop, called \"Anning's Fossil Depot\". The move was covered in the local paper, which noted that the shop currently had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display. Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited Anning at Lyme to purchase specimens. These included the geologist George William Featherstonhaugh who purchased fossils for the newly opened New York Lyceum of Natural History in 1827. King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection.\nA publication.\nLady Harriet Silvester visited Lyme in 1824. She remarked in her diary:\n... the extraordinary thing in this young woman is that she has made herself so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong. She fixes the bones on a frame with cement and then makes drawings and has them engraved. . . It is certainly a wonderful instance of divine favour \u2013 that this poor, ignorant girl should be so blessed, for by reading and application she has arrived to that degree of knowledge as to be in the habit of writing and talking with professors and other clever men on the subject, and they all acknowledge that she understands more of the science than anyone else in this kingdom.\nAs time passed, her confidence in her knowledge increased, and in 1839 she wrote to the \"Magazine of Natural History\" to question their claim that a hooked tooth of the prehistoric shark \"Hybodus\" represented a new discovery. She had discovered years ago the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth. The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only thing that Anning ever published.\nHer later fame.\nMary Anning is the subject of the old tongue-twister, \"She sells sea shells on the sea shore.\" It was composed in 1908, more than a half century after her death, by Terry Sullivan who was inspired by her life story. The lyrics have changed over time, but the original text was:&lt;br&gt;\nShe sells seashells on the seashore&lt;br&gt;\nThe shells she sells are seashells, I'm sure&lt;br&gt;\nSo if she sells seashells on the seashore&lt;br&gt;\nThen I'm sure she sells seashore shells.&lt;br&gt;\nAnning's life story was seen as inspirational by a number of writers in the 20th century. Most of this material was intended as inspirational literature for children, and tended to focus on her childhood and early career, neglecting her later accomplishments. Much of it was also romanticized and not always historically accurate. She appeared as a character in historical novels, perhaps most notably in \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1969) by John Fowles, which was made into a feature film in 1981. Fowles observed critically that no British scientist had named a species after Anning in her lifetime.\nHowever, in the 1840s the Swiss-American expert on fossil fish Louis Agassiz did name two fossil fish species, \"Acrodus anningiae\", and \"Belenostomus anningiae\", after her, and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the two women had given him in examining and understanding fossil fish specimens, during his 1834 visit to Lyme Regis."}

It can cause emotional damage. Cyberbullying\u201d was first used in 1998. Cyberbullying can include sending threats and unwanted sexual messages. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Examples include: spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos of someone on social media, sending hurtful messages or threats via messaging platforms, impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf. Face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying can often happen alongside each other. But cyberbullying leaves a digital footprint \u2013 a record that can prove useful and provide evidence to help stop the abuse.\nThe prevalence of cyberbullying is shocking, especially for youth: Over 59% of teenagers in the US have experienced cyberbullying, and globally 33% of parents report having or knowing a child within their community who had been cyberbullied. Cyberbullying is not only limited to children and teenagers however. 41% of adults in the US report having personally experienced online harassment, with 66% reporting that they have seen this negative behavior directed at others. High profile cases of celebrities being harassed online often end up on the news.\nSome schools have started programs to teach students about cyberbullying and how to deal with it.\nEffects of Cyberbullying.\nVictims may experience the following effects after being cyberbullied:\nLegal status.\nIn 2006, a 13 year old girl in Missouri killed herself after receiving mean messages on MySpace from a woman pretending to be a teenage boy. The state of Missouri then made using technology like the Internet or text messages to harass someone illegal.\nIn New Hampshire, a law was passed in 2010 that said that schools must have rules against cyberbullying.\nOn October 12, 2012, a Canadian girl named Amanda Todd killed herself. A few years before this happened, she showed her breasts on a video chat, and a man later messaged her saying that if Todd did not show more parts of her body then he would post the pictures he had taken of her from the video chat to the Internet. She faced a lot of bullying on the internet afterwards. It is clear that both adults and children all over the world can be affected by cyberbullying, which sometimes lead to disturbing consequences.

In English it means Bach Works Catalogue.\nThe catalogue was made by Wolfgang Schmieder in 1950. He took all the music that is known by Johann Sebastian Bach (some of Bach's music has been lost) and gave each piece a number. Each piece of music by Bach therefore has a BWV number. For example, the \"Mass in B minor\" is BWV 232. Giving each piece a number helps musicians to know exactly which piece of music we are talking about. For example, there are several Preludes and Fugues in G major, but putting \"Prelude and Fugue in G major BWV550\" makes it clear which one it is.\nThe BWV numbers are not listed chronologically (in the order they were written). They are grouped according to what kind of music it is: all the cantatas together, all the concertos together, etc.\nSome pieces of music may be written by Bach, but we are not sure. Those doubtful pieces of music are listed separately as \"BWV Anhang\" (BWV appendix). Some of what Schmieder wrote in 1950 has been updated because some new music by Bach has been discovered. Other pieces of music have now been proved not to be by Bach.\nBach, like many composers from long ago, did not use opus numbers, because very few of his works were published during his lifetime.\nSome older books write \"S\" instead of \"BWV\" (S for Schmieder), but Schmieder did not want this. He wanted Bach's name to be used, not his own."}

He made farmers in the Soviet Union change the way they farmed, then he tried to make the farmers work harder for the government-owned farms, for less money. Many people in the Ukraine did not want to go along with this. When the Ukraine had a famine, Stalin refused to help the people in the Ukraine. Instead, the government took food away from people. It became illegal (against the law) to pick up food from the ground of fields. The government also tried to stop people from moving around the country to look for food.\nScholars and politicians using the word Holodomor say the man-made aspects of the famine, was a genocide; some consider the huge loss of life comparable to the Holocaust. They argue that the Soviet policies were an attack on the rise of Ukrainian nationalism and therefore is a genocide.\nOther scholars say that the Holodomor was an unexpected consequence of the rapid and massive industrialization started by Stalin, that brought radical economic changes to the farmers and the country, and which was not done on purpose."}

This showed it was a member of the long-tailed sub-order of pterosaurs, the Rhamphorhynchoidea. \"Eudimorphodon\" was small in size, with 110 teeth packed into a jaw only 6 cms long. Teeth at the front are fangs, further back the teeth are small and multipointed, many with five cusps. This is unique among pterosaurs, whose teeth are usually of a simple conical form.\nStomach contents showed it had eaten a small fish, \"Parapholidophorus\". The top and bottom teeth of \"Eudimorphodon\" came into direct contact with each other when the jaws were closed, especially at the back of the jaw. The teeth were multi-cusped, and tooth wear shows that \"Eudimorphodon\" was able to crush or chew its food to some degree. Wear along the sides of these teeth suggests that \"Eudimorphodon\" also fed on hard-shelled invertebrates.\nJuvenile \"Eudimorphodon\" had somewhat different and fewer teeth, and may have eaten insects.\nAn unsolved puzzle is the flexibility of the tail, which lacks the very long stiffening vertebral extensions other long-tailed pterosaurs have. This flexibility is a basal trait; its functional significance in this genus is unknown. However, it is known that the stiffened tail of \"Rhamphorhynchus\"-like pterosaurs is a device which adds stability to their flight.

Rise Against formed in 1999. Their current members are Tim McIlrath (vocals, guitar), Joe Principe (bass guitar), Brandon Barnes (drums), and Zach Blair (guitar). All of the members are straight edge (except Barnes), and the band supports PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). They are also vegans. The band is currently signed to Geffen. Geffen is a record label owned by Universal Music Group. As of 2009, Rise Against has had six studio albums, two EPs, and one DVD.\nRise Against spent its first five years signed to the record label \"Fat Wreck Chords,\" on which it released two studio albums. The band got reviewer popularity with its first two releases on Geffen, \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\" (2004) and \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\" (2006). These two albums made many high-charting singles, like \"Swing Life Away\", \"Prayer of the Refugee\", and \"The Good Left Undone\". Their newest studio album, \"Appeal to Reason\" (2008), was released in North America on 7 October. It got to number three on the U.S Billboard 200 and made the three singles, \"Re-Education (Through Labor)\", \"Audience of One\", and \"Savior\".\nHistory.\nEarly years (1999\u20132003).\nRise Against was first made with the name \"Transistor Revolt\" in 1999 by former members of the bands 88 Fingers Louie and Baxter. The first group was Tim McIlrath (vocals), Joe Principe (bass and vocals), Toni Tintari (drums), and Mr. Precision (guitar and vocals). The band never performed live with this group. Instead, it released a self-made demo or EP. It was called \"Transistor Revolt\". They made it in the year 2000, a year before signing with Fat Wreck Chords. Tintari left shortly after making \"Transistor Revolt\", and was replaced by Brandon Barnes. Barnes was first from Screeching Weasel and Squirtgun's drummer. The band changed its name to Rise Against in 2001 and made its first album, \"The Unraveling\" (made by veteran punk maker Mass Giorgini) on Fat Wreck Chords that same year. Mr. Precision then left the band in 2001. He was replaced by Todd Mohney. Mohney joined before the band began writing their second full-length album, \"Revolutions per Minute\".\nAfter touring in support of \"The Unraveling\", the band came back to the studio in December 2002 to work on their second full-length album. The album would be called \"Revolutions per Minute\" (made by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore at The Blasting Room). It was released in 2003. The band toured a lot in support of its first two albums. They also performed in helping roles for \"Sick of It All,\" \"NOFX,\" \"Agnostic Front,\" \"No Use for a Name,\" \"AFI,\" and \"Strung Out.\" Rise Against also helped out in the 2003 \"Warped Tour.\"\n\"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\" (2004\u20132005).\nRise Against signed onto DreamWorks Records in December 2003 and made their third album, \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\" in 2004. DreamWorks was soon absorbed by the Universal Music Group, and Rise Against found itself with Geffen Records instead. Shortly after the band signed with Geffen, Mohney left and was replaced by guitarist Chris Chasse. Rise Against released \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\" in August 2004. The album was their first to be the band's album on a famous record label, and was their first to reach the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. It also was awarded gold by the Recording Industry Association of America\u00a0(RIAA). The album got mostly good reviews from reviewers. In giving the album three out of five stars, Johnny Loftus from Allmusic said that \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\" sometimes \"\"gets carried away with its own music .\" However, he goes on to say that because of the album being the band's first famous-label release, \"maybe the fuller sound and sometimes forays into acoustic guitars and cello overdubs...are OK.\"\"\nRise Against toured North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan in support of \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\". Some of the best performances are those on the first worldwide \"Taste of Chaos\" tour in 2005 (with Funeral for a Friend, Story of the Year, The Used, and Killswitch Engage), a worldwide tour to the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Japan, the Give It a Name tour in the United Kingdom, the Reading Festival and Leeds Festival in the United Kingdom a United States tour with Alkaline Trio, and the Warped Tour in North America.\n\"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\" (2006\u20132007).\nIn January 2006, after touring in support of \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\", Rise Against started to work on their fourth studio album at the Blasting Room studio in Fort Collins, Colorado. With makers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\" was released on 4 July 2006. The album got to number 10 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 48,397 copies in its first week of release. It was then awarded gold by the RIAA in 2008. \"The Age\" newspaper said that with \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\", the band \"returns to their punk roots.\" Plus, the album got mostly good reviews by reviewers. Corey Apar of Allmusic, in giving the album four out of five stars, said of it, \"\"the band's inner grit is aptly drawn out amid all the pit-ready choruses and fist-in-the-air, stirring lyrics.\" She goes on to say, \"Rise Against continue to muscularly confront political and personal grievances to the tune of swirling guitars, assertive rhythms, and Tim McIlrath's sandpapered vocals.\"\" Then Christine Leonard of \"Fast Forward Weekly\" says of the band, \"\"Returning to their old school form with the ballistic intensity of \"Bricks,\" they just as quickly lose focus with questionable efforts such as 'Worth Dying For' and the oh-so-weary 'Prayer of the Refugee'.\"\nA DVD called \"Generation Lost\" was released on 5 December 2006 to help the band and their new album. It is a movie of the careers of the band members, as well as live performance videos and making-of shorts. Rise Against toured in support of \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\" through the second half of 2006 and all of 2007. The band was a big band in the 2006 Warped Tour. In late 2006, the band said that they would tour with Thursday. The bands Circa Survive and Billy Talent would also come too. In early 2007, the band had My Chemical Romance open for them on the first half of their big tour. On 23 February 2007, Rise Against said guitarist Chris Chasse, would leave. Chasse was then replaced by longtime friend Zach Blair from Only Crime. On 15 June 2007, the band started their first big tour in support of \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\". It was a North American tour that lasted throughout the summer months. During this tour, on 3 July 2007, Rise Against recorded an EP in Canada titled \"This Is Noise\", which was then released in the United States on 15 January 2008.\n\"Appeal to Reason\" (2008-present).\nBefore the album was released, Rise Against supported it by performing at the sixteenth yearly KROQ Weenie Roast on 17 May in Irvine, California. They also performed at the sixth yearly Download Festival on 13 June at Donington Park, England. They played at Switzerland's Greenfield Festival as well as Germany's Hurricane Festival and Southside Festival. Like many past years, the band participated in the Vans Warped Tour, although they only performed on the tour's west coast swing from 6 August to\n17 August.\nRise Against's fifth studio album \"Appeal to Reason\" was released on 4 October in Australia. It was then released 6 October across Europe. Then 7 October in the United States. The album sold 64,700 copies in its first week. It also got to number\u00a0three on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200. This made it Rise Against's highest scoring album. \"Appeal to Reason\" also got mostly good reviews. However, reviewers did not rate it as good as \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\". Most people thought this because Rise Against is moving toward slower music and away from faster hardcore punk. Giving the album a C+ review, Marc Weingarten of \"Entertainment Weekly\" says the album is filled with \"protest anthems that lean closer to the angst of such bands as New Found Glory and Fall Out Boy than the genuine outrage of brainy Green Day\" and songs that are \"peppy but pretty empty, power-chord downers with little bark or bite\".\" Kyle Anderson from \"Rolling Stone\" says that the songs on \"Appeal to Reason\" \"\"are driven by an ever-sharpening pop \".\" He finishes by saying, \"\"Rise Against may be about leaving the underground behind, but with sharp songs like these, they're ready for the rest of the world\".\"\nRise Against then went on a North American tour with other bands such as Rancid, Billy Talent, Killswitch Engage, and Riverboat Gamblers in June and July 2009. They also did a short tour in the United Kingdom in November. The bands Thursday and Poison the Well helped Rise Against do that tour. The band also played at KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas in December 2009, playing right before AFI. The band will release a record with Face to Face, but no date has been said. After finishing a Europen tour from October to November 2009 and an Australian tour in January and February 2010, Rise Against will start working on a new album.\nMusic style and inspiration.\nRise Against's musical style throughout the band's history has been thought by most reviewers as hardcore punk, melodic hardcore, or punk rock. The band has cited many punk and hardcore bands as inspiration to its music. In 2004, drummer Brandon Barnes said: \"\"I think we have a lot of different influences from hardcore like old Cave In, to a lot of punk like Face to Face, Screeching Weasel, and Down By Law\".\"\nThe band's songs focus on melody, catchy hooks, aggressive movements, and fast-paced tempo. Guitarists McIlrath and Blair focus on speed riffing and multi-layered choruses. Bassist Principe uses aggressive picking to lock in with the snare and kick of the drums. Frummer Barnes follows the guitars. He says: \"Sometimes I'll do it naturally, or we'll talk about different ways to accent things - fills from the snare or toms, or some big crashes.\"\nIn 2006, Tim McIlrath described the band's style: \"We\u2019re Minor Threat and Black Flag. Who knows, maybe if Ian MacKaye was wearing eyeliner then I would be.\" Other bands that have inspired Rise Against are Descendents, Dead Kennedys, Refused, and Bad Religion.\nDuring the early part of their career, Rise Against's music had a gritty combination of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. \"The Unraveling\" had a raw punk sound, while \"Revolutions per Minute\" had an overall darker tone.\nPolitics and ethics.\nAll of the group's members are vegetarians. All of them are also supporters of PETA, an animal rights organization. Their video for the song \"Ready to Fall\" has video of factory farming, rodeos, and sport hunting. It also has videos of deforestation, melting ice caps, and forest fires. The group said that that video was the most important video they have ever made. In February 2012, the band released a cover of the Bob Dylan song \"Ballad of Hollis Brown\". This was part of a benefit for Amnesty International. The Director's Cut of the video was first shown on a PETA website. In 2009, the band was voted Best Animal-Friendly Band by PETA. All the members of Rise Against (except Brandon Barnes) are straight edge; that is, they do not drink alcohol, and they do not use drugs.\nthe band has voiced their support for Democratic and libertarian causes. During the 2004 United States presidential election, the band was part of Punkvoter, a political activist group. They appeared on the \"Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1\" compilation. The Rock Against Bush project raised over $1 million for John Kerry. John Kerry was the Democratic presidential candidate at that time. During the 2008 presidential election, the band members supported Barack Obama. In a news bulletin in early 2009, the band said: \"Few things are more exciting than watching Bush finally release America as his eight year hostage.\"\nVans shoes.\nOn 23 May 2007 Rise Against said they have an endorsement of a new line of Vans shoes. They said that the shoes would be \"completely vegan in consideration to [their] animal rights efforts\". Because people criticized them due to rumors that Vans' use sweatshops, Rise Against said on their MySpace profile and website,"}

{"id": "229375", "revid": "1110", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229375", "title": "The Author's Farce", "text": "Henry Fielding wrote the play The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town. It was first acted on 30\u00a0March 1730 in the Haymarket Theatre. The play responds to the rejection of Fielding's early plays and was his first success.\nHarry Luckless is the main character of the play. He tries to write a play in the first act and completes the play in the second act. It is a puppet play called \"The Pleasures of the Town\". Many theatres do not accept the play but it is later shown within the third act. The play is about the puppet character Goddess Nonsense who wants a husband. The end of \"The Author's Farce\" combines the characters of the puppet play and the main play for humour.\nFielding became a popular writer in London after \"The Author's Farce\". The Haymarket Theatre let him experiment with his plays and Fielding changed the comedy genre. The puppet play within the main play made fun of other London plays. \"The Author's Farce\" was first a success. Then, it was ignored by critics until the 20th century. Critics focused on the play's effects on Fielding's work.\nPlot.\n\"The Author's Farce\" has three acts. The play begins with Harry Luckless wanting a relationship with his landlady's daughter Harriot. Also, he is a writer and he is writing a play. The start of the play is like Fielding's other plays but the rest of the play is different. Luckless wants to be a good writer but he cannot make money. Other people want to give Luckless money but he does not want it. When Luckless's friend Witmore pays Luckless's rent, Luckless steals the money back. In the second act, Luckless asks for help to finish his puppet play \"The Pleasures of the Town\". However, people give him bad advice and theatres reject the play. Later, a theatre shows the play. The third act is the puppet play. The puppets are acted by real people and not puppets.\nThe third act is the puppet play and is a play within a play. It takes place along the River Styx and starts with the Goddess of Nonsense wanting a husband. There are many possible husbands there and they are stupid. They are Dr Orator, Sir Farcical Comic, Mrs Novel, Bookseller, Poet, Monsieur Pantomime, Don Tragedio, and Signior Opera. She selects Signior Opera after he sings for her. He is an opera signior and a castrato. Mrs Novel claims that she and Signior Opera had a child. This makes the Goddess of Nonsense angry but she forgives Signior Opera. The puppet play is stopped by the characters Constable and Murdertext. They want to arrest Luckless for hurting the Goddess of Nonsense. Mrs Novel asks for the play to be completed and they agree. However, a person from the land of Bantam stops the play and says that Luckless is the prince of Bantam. Another messenger comes and says that the King of Bantam died and Luckless is the new king. Luckless is told that his landlady is the Queen of Old Brentford and her daughter Harriot is a princess. The play ends with four poets saying how they would end the play. They are stopped by a cat that looks like a person. The cat person ends the play.\nMeaning.\n\"The Author's Farce\" show parts of Fielding's life and experience with the London theatre community. Some of his other plays were rejected from the Theatre Royal. \"The Author's Farce\" was put on at a small theatre. This allowed Fielding to experiment. He could not experiment at larger theatres. The play was the first to have things found in his later plays. However, he did not come up with them all. He got many of his ideas from the Scriblerus Club. Their members were Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot. One idea is his character Nonsense. She is similar to Pope's character Dulness in the \"Dunciad\". Both characters promote bad writing. Fielding gave Nonsense a sexual aspect. It is funny when she chooses as a lover a man who is sexless. Other parts of the play are similar to Gay's \"Beggar's Opera\".\nThe play is a farce. Farces use slapstick and physical humour to be funny. They also use absurd plots. A farce also makes serious situations funny. Fielding thought that theatre was becoming bad. He mocked theatre and theatre audiences in his play. His character Luckless states that for someone to become successful they must write nonsense. His only desire is to make money. Other characters feel that money is all that matters. They do not care about good writing. Even Harriot believes that a good lover is one who is rich. Fielding made the same claims about people when he attacked Samuel Richardson's novel, \"Pamela\".\nThe ending of the play merges real and fake. Fielding defends an old view of writing. He also attacks new types of writing. He uses puppets to represent various genres. He made fun of people liking Italian opera. The puppet character Signior Opera is a castrato. Castratos are men without testicles. The character Nonsense wants him as a lover. Mrs Novel says that Signior Opera had a baby with her. However, Signior Opera can't have sex or have babies. Fielding is mocking how women like Italian opera singers. Other writers mocked Italian opera singers. William Hogarth says the castratos are related to politics. Many other writers make fun of women who favour castratos.\nSources.\nThe play uses characters and ideas from Fielding's life. The characters Marplay and Sparkish manage the theatre. They offer Luckless poor advice on how to write a play. Then also reject Luckless's play. This is what Colley Cibber and Robert Wilks did to Fielding. They rejected his play \"The Temple Beau\". When Wilks died Fielding changed the play. He removed Sparkish. He added a character like Theophilus Cibber, the son of Colley. The character was like Theopilus during the Actor Rebellion of 1733.\nLuckless and Mrs. Moneywood is similar to Fielding with Jan Oson. Oson was his landlord during 1729. When staying with Oson, Fielding owed a lot of money. Fielding fled to London and Oson took his property to pay for the debt. Mrs Moneywood does the same in the play. Characters in the puppet play are based on real people. Mrs Novel is Eliza Haywood. Signior Opera is Senesino. Bookweight is similar to Edmund Curll. Orator is John Henley. Monsieur Pantomime is John Rich. Don Tragedio is Lewis Theobald. Sir Farcical Comick is of Colley Cibber as an actor.\nFielding also used literary sources. His plot is like George Farquhar's \"Love and a Bottle\" (1698). Both talk about a writing and a landlady. They have many differences. Fielding took from the writing of the Scriblerus Club and other plays. Luckless's life is similar to characters in John Dryden's \"The Rehearsal\" (1672), Farquhar's \"Love and a Bottle\" (1698), James Ralph's \"The Touch-Stone\" (1728), and Richard Savage's \"An Author to be Lett\" (1729). The play has similar ideas to \"Dunciad Variorum\". He also borrowed from Gay's \"Three Hours after Marriage\" (1717) and \"The Beggar's Opera\" (1728). Fielding's play also influenced other works. They included the revised \"Dunciad\" and Gay's \"The Rehearsal at Goatham\".\nResponse.\nThe play was successful. Fielding became a popular writer. It was shown with \"Tom Thumb\". That helped it be liked. \"The Pleasures of the Town\" was the most liked part. The \"Daily Post\" newspaper said it was approved by all. A newspaper that didn't like Fielding also said that the play was liked. Many well-known people and royalty in Britain saw the show. John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont said that the play was \"full of humour, with some wit.\" The play was rarely mentioned later in the 18th century. This was true in the 19th century. The play was printed again a few times. Leslie Stephen and Austin Dobson studied the play. They looked at what the play said about Fielding's life.\n20th-century critics agreed with Dobson. Many of the critics like Charles Woods talked about the play as part of Fielding's writing career. He also said the work was not political. Later critics agreed with Woods. Many modern critics approved of the play. They are Wilbur Cross, Frederick Homes Dudden, Ian Donaldson, Pat Rogers, Robert Hume, Martin and Ruthe Battestin, Harold Pagliaro, and Thomas Lockwood. Some critics liked the play but not all of it. They are J. Paul Hunter, Matthew Kinservik,\nStage history.\nHenry Fielding wrote \"The Author's Farce\" in 1729. It was made after the Theatre Royal rejected his plays. Advertisements were put in the 18 March 1730 \"Daily Post\" and in the 21 March 1730 \"Weekly Medley and Literary Journal\". They said that actors were practicing the play. An advertisement in the 23 and 26 \"Daily Post\" said the play would have a puppet play. The advertisement also said prices will be high. That suggests that the play would be popular. The first show was on 30 March 1730, Easter Monday. It took place at the Little Theatre and was shown 41 times. On 6 April 1730, the play \"The Cheats of Scapin\" was shown with it.\nFielding changed \"The Author's Farce\". The new play was shown on 21 April 1730 with Fielding's play \"Tom Thumb\". They were shown together in May and June 32 times. They were shown again on 3 July 1730. On 1 August 1730, the last act of the play was shown for the Tottenham Court fair. An advertisement in the \"Daily Post\" on 17 October 1730 said the play had a new prologue. The changed play was shown on 21 October. It was changed again then it was replaced by the play \"The Beggar's Wedding\" by Charles Coffey. The play came back on 18 November 1730. Only the first and second act were shown between November and January. During this time, it was shown with the play \"Damon and Phillida\". \"Damon and Phillida\" was stopped and the play \"The Jealous Taylor\" was added on 13 January 1731. \"The Author's Farce\" was shown from January to March 1731. It was shown again with a new prologue on 10 May 1731. The new prologue is now gone.\n\"The Author's Farce\" was shown with \"The Tragedy of Tragedies\" on 31 March 1731. They were shown 6 times. The last regular show at the Little Theatre was 18 June 1731. It was shown one time on 12 May 1732. The last show of \"The Author's Farce\" as a regular play was on 28 March 1748. Theophilus Cibber ran the show. The last act \"Pleasures of the Town\" was shown on its own. It was shown 16 times at Norwich after 1749. Also, it was shown at York in 1751 to 1752. The whole play was acted by puppets many times. Thomas Yeates had puppet shows called \"Punch's Oratory, or The Pleasures of the Town\" after 1734.\nFielding changed \"The Author's Farce\" at the end of 1733. He added a new prologue and epilogue. Fielding changed it after the Actor Rebellion of 1733. The 8 January 1734 \"Daily Journal\" had an advertisement. It said \"The Author's Farce\" would be shown at the Theatre Royal. It was shown six times. The cast was not as good as the first cast. It was shown 4 times with the play \"The Intriguing Chambermade\" and 2 times with the play \"The Harlot's Progress\". The changed \"The Author's Farce\" was printed with \"The Intriguing Chambermade\" and a letter written by an unknown author. The changed \"The Author's Farce\" was printed again in 1750 until 1966. Arthur Murphy printed the play in 1762 in \"Works of Henry Fielding\". George Saintsbury printed the play in 1893 in \"Works of Henry Fielding\". G. H. Maynadier printed act one and two in 1903 in \"Works of Henry Fielding\".\nCast.\n1730 cast.\nPlay:\nInternal puppet show:\n1734 changed cast.\nPlay:\nInternal puppet show:"}

It tells the story of an unscrupulous coquette (flirtatious woman) widow who does not care about the feelings of other men. She wrote it when she was writing her first version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (which was at that time called \"Elinor and Marianne\"), and which was also at first, like \"Lady Susan\", written in letter form. She was at this time 20 years old.\nStyle.\nThe epistolary novel had been popular in the 18th century, but it was not the best style of writing for Jane Austen's talents (which is why all her major novels were written in the third-person narrative style). She admired Richardson very much (all of his books are written in letters, like \"Pamela (novel)\" and \"Clarissa (novel)\"), and she also admired Frances Burney's style, but none of their styles came naturally to her. She pointed out at the end of \"Lady Susan\": \"This correspondence (letter-writing), by a meeting between some of the parties (people) and a separation between the others could not, to the great detriment of the Post Office...be continued longer.\"\nIn those days, girls spent some time each day especially to write letters, so a story through letters is much more realistic than it would be today. People like Frances Burney wrote letters that were witty and full of information, so that her diaries and letters were later published. The letters of William Cowper, too, are famous. Jane Austen's letters, however, are private letters about family matters, such as sick babies, partners at balls, beef, and raspberry bushes."}

{"id": "229417", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229417", "title": "Crime and Punishment", "text": "Crime and Punishment is a novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was the first great novel of his mature period.\nIt was first published in the literary journal \"The Russian Messenger\" in 12 monthly series in 1866. It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoevsky's novels, written after he returned from his punishment (exile in Siberia). \nPlot.\n\"Crime and Punishment\" is about the troubles of Raskolnikov, a young man living in St. Petersburg. He used to be a student, but he became so poor he had to stop studying. He plans to kill a selfish old pawnbroker for her money, and he acts on his plan. Raskolnikov argues that with her money he can do good things, and that he was simply killing a person who was not worth anything. He also murdered her to test his idea that some people are naturally better than others and have the right to murder. Several times in the novel, Raskolnikov justifies himself by comparing himself to Napoleon, saying that murder is allowed for a higher purpose.\nHowever, after he kills the pawnbroker, questions which he cannot answer and feelings he had not expected terrify him. He feels separated from mankind, nature, and truth. Because of this, he decides at last to confess to the police and accept suffering.\nCreation.\nDostoevsky began the idea of \"Crime and Punishment\" in the summer of 1865. This was after he had gambled away much of his money. Because of this, he could not pay his bills or eat properly. He owed large sums of money to creditors, and was also trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail. Mikhail had died in early 1864. He began writing it under the title \"The Drunkards\". He wanted to write about \"the current problem of drunkenness\". However, when Dostoevsky began writing about Raskolnikov's crime, the theme of crime and punishment became his main subject instead.\nDostoevsky offered his story to the publisher Mikhail Katkov. At the time, he did not think of \"Crime and Punishment\" as a novel. Famous writers such as Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy often used Katkov's monthly journal, \"The Russian Messenger\", to print their writings. Dostoevsky, though, had argued with Katkov in the early 1860s, and had never printed anything in the journal. Finally, Dostoevsky asked Katkov for help when others would not print his book. In September 1865, Dostoevsky wrote a letter to Katkov. In the letter, he explained to him that \"Crime and Punishment\" was going to be about a young man who believes in \"certain strange, 'unfinished' ideas, yes floating in the air\". He also said that he wanted to study the moral and psychological dangers of \"radical\" ideas. In letters written in November 1865 an important change had happened: the \"story\" has become a \"novel\", From then on, Dostoevsky always spoke of \"Crime and Punishment\" as a novel.\nDostoevsky had to write very quickly to finish both \"The Gambler\" and \"Crime and Punishment\". Anna Snitkina, a stenographer whom he later married, helped him very much. The first part of \"Crime and Punishment\" appeared in January 1866 in \"The Russian Messenger\". The last part was published in December 1866.\nWhen Dostoevsky's complete writings were published in the Soviet Union, the editors put together the notebooks that Dostoevsky kept while he was working on \"Crime and Punishment\" and printed it. They printed the notebooks in the same order as the book was written. Through their efforts, there is now a small part of how Dostoevsky first imagined \"Crime and Punishment\" to be written. There are also two other versions of the story. They are called the Wiesbaden edition, the Petersburg edition, and the final (last) plan. A part of a change in the story was that instead of the story being told by a character inside it, it was written as if many uninvolved people were writing it (this was a form of writing that Dostoevsky made up). The Wiesbaden edition is mostly about the reaction of the writer to his murder. It is quite similar to the story that Dostoevsky described in his letter to Katkov, and was written like a diary or journal. It had the same story as what later became part II.\nSummary.\nRaskolnikov is a mentally insecure student who has stopped going to university. He lives in a very small, rented room in Saint Petersburg. He does not let anyone help him, not even his friend Razumihin. He plans to kill and steal money from an old pawnbroker and moneylender, Alyona Ivanovna, but it is not clear why he wants to kill her yet. While he is thinking about this plan, Raskolnikov meets Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a sad drunkard who recently spent all of his poor family's money on drinking. He also gets a letter from his mother. His mother says that she will soon visit St. Petersburg. She writes about his sister's sudden engagement, saying that they will talk about it when they arrive.\nAfter thinking, Raskolnikov goes to Alyona Ivanovna's apartment. There, he murders her with an axe. Her quiet half-sister, Lizaveta, comes inside. Surprised, Raskolnikov quickly kills her, too. Frightened by what he has done, he leaves most of Alyona Ivanovna's wealth behind, only stealing a few things and a small purse. He then runs away without being seen by anybody.\nAfter his murder, Raskolnikov is filled with worry. He hides the things he stole under a rock and tries to clean away the blood from his clothes. After a short visit to his friend Razumihin, he becomes sick with a fever and seems to wish to betray himself. Whenever anyone speaks of the murder of the pawnbroker, he acts strangely.\nOther websites.\nCriticism\nOnline text"}

S. Lewis. It is set in an imaginary place called Narnia, where the main characters who are brothers and sisters are led into by the back of a wardrobe (closet). It is the second book by order in the Narnia series after \"The Magician's Nephew\", but is the first book published in the series.\nSummary.\nPeter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie leave London during World War II to live in the country. While playing in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe. She finds that it leads to a different land. There, she meets a faun (half-goat, half-man) named Mr. Tumnus. While having tea, he tells her that the land is called Narnia. It is ruled by the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. When Lucy returns to the wardrobe after many hours, she finds that only a few seconds have passed in England. Her brothers and sister do not believe her and the wardrobe has closed so they cannot go into Narnia. \nMany weeks later, Lucy comes back to the wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek. Edmund follows her into Narnia, but cannot find her. Instead, he meets a lady. She says she is the Queen of Narnia and gives him Turkish Delight. She promises to make him prince if he will bring the other children to her castle. After she leaves, Edmund finds Lucy. When she talks about the White Witch, he thinks that it is the lady he met. When they get back to England, Edmund lies to Peter and Susan and says they did not go to Narnia. This makes Lucy upset. \nLater, they are all hiding from the housekeeper and go into the wardrobe. This time they all go into Narnia. When Lucy leads them to Tumnus's cave, they find that he is arrested and his cave destroyed. Two talking beavers shelter the children. They also tell them about a prophecy that the witch will fail when two Sons of Adam (human males) and two Daughters of Eve (human females) sit on the thrones at Cair Paravel, Narnia's ruling castle. The beavers also tell them about Aslan, the true king of Narnia. He is a great lion and has been gone for many years, but has come back. \nEdmund sneaks away to go to the witch. When they find out, the children and beavers go to find Aslan. The witch is mean to Edmund because he did not bring his siblings and leaves to chase them. The winter is starting to warm into spring and she is stopped by the thaw. The children find Aslan and rescue Edmund just before the witch kills him. He is very sorry for following her. The witch says that Edmund must be given back to her because of an old law. The law says that all traitors (people who break trust) belong to her. Aslan gives himself in place. He is killed, but comes back to life through an even older law. This one says that if someone who has not committed the crime willingly takes the punishment, he will come back to life. \nIn a big fight, the witch is killed by Aslan. The children are kings and queens in Narnia for 15 years, growing into adults. Then they return to England through the wardrobe and are kids again. No time has passed.\nMain Characters.\nPeter Pevensie.\nPeter Pevensie is the oldest Pevensie. He does not believe about Narnia until he sees it. He receives a sword and shield from Father Christmas. He kills a wolf, Maugrim, the head of the witch's police. He is call \"Sir Peter, Wolf's-Bane\" because of this. In the end, he is High King of Narnia. He is called King Peter the Magnificent (grand).\nSusan Pevensie.\nSusan Pevensie is second oldest. Like Peter, she does not believe in Narnia until they go there. She receives a gift from Father Christmas, a magical horn along with a bow and arrow that is promised to never miss if she trusts in them. At the end of the book, she is called Queen Susan the Gentle. She is the prettiest.\nEdmund Pevensie.\nEdmund Pevensie is the third child. He likes the White Witch because she gives him sweets and promises to make him prince. He is sorry for that. When he is King, he is known as King Edmund the Just. \nLucy Pevensie.\nLucy Pevensie is the youngest Pevensie child. She is the first to find Narnia. She is very good friends with Mr.Tumnus. She receives a knife and a fire flower potion, which can heal any wound. At the end of the book she is known of Queen Lucy the Valiant (brave). \nWhite Witch.\nThe White Witch is the false queen of Narnia. She makes it always winter, but never Christmas. She can turn things to stone. She is afraid of the children and Aslan, because they should be the rulers. \nAslan.\nAslan is the true king of Narnia and a lion. He gives himself to save Edmund, but comes back to life through an old law called the \"Deeper Magic\". In the battle, he kills the witch. He leaves after the children are crowned. Aslan also supports Partick Thistle."}

It started about 307. Epicurus was a materialist who believed that material was made of atoms. The teaching about atoms was first started by Democritus. \nEpicurus forcefully attacked superstition. According to Epicurus, the gods are passive: They do not intervene in the world. According to Aristippus, Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to have certain pleasures, and to reach a state of mind where there is no fear and no pain. Epicureanism is a form of hedonism, which declares that pleasure is the only good there is. Epicureanism says that the absence of pain is the greatest pleasure; it also advocates a simple life. These ideas make it sufficiently different from \"hedonism\" as it is usually defined.\nIn the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life. Epicurus spoke favorably about the enjoyment of simple pleasures; He also meant abstaining from bodily desires, such as sex and appetites, almost like asceticism. \nHe argued that when eating, one should not eat too richly, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later, such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future. Likewise, sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner. Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social morality that has survived.\nEpicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. Many Epicurean societies flourished in the late Hellenistic perod and during the Roman era (such as those in Antiochia, Alexandria, Rhodes and Ercolano). \nThe poet Lucretius was its best-known Roman proponent. By the end of the Roman Empire, having undergone Christian attack and repression, Epicureanism had all but died out, but was resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist Pierre Gassendi, who adapted it to the Christian doctrine.\nSome writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem \"On the Nature of Things\" by Lucretius presents in one work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus."}

The tropical rainforest covers most of the eastern part of the Congo. \nThis forest and its river were the subject of a famous book called \"The Heart of Darkness\" by Joseph Conrad. Hunting and poaching has endangered many of the animals there, but the jungle itself is not being destroyed.\nPlants.\nThe basin of the Congo has 70% of Africa's plant cover. It makes up a large portion of Africa's biodiversity with over 600 tree species and 10,000 animal species.\nAnimals.\nMany unusual animals live in the Congo Basin. The two species of chimpanzee, for example, live only in the Congo rainforests. The large one is the common chimpanzee (\"Pan troglodytes\"), and the smaller one is the bonobo (\"Pan paniscus\"). They live in different areas. Also, gorillas live in the rainforest of central Africa. The gorillas of the Congo rainforest are called \"lowland gorillas\". \nThe hippopotamus is another animal that can be found in the Congo rainforest, usually in the river. Elephants also live in the rainforest, but only the smaller African forest elephant (\"Loxodonta cyclotis\"). Another interesting animal in the Congo rainforest is the okapi. The okapi is an interesting species. It is related to the giraffe, but looks more like a zebra. There are other endemic or notable mammals, such as Allen's swamp monkey, the dryas monkey, the aquatic genet, and there is also the Congo peafowl.\nThere are a variety of snakes, but snakes of the Congo basin are not so well known as those of the rest of Africa.\nGeography.\nThe Congolese forests cover southeastern Cameroon, eastern Gabon, the northern and central Republic of the Congo, the northern and central Democratic Republic of the Congo and portions of southern and southwestern Central African Republic.\nEcology.\nTo the north and south, the forests transition to drier forest-savanna mosaic, a mosaic of drier forests, savannas, and grasslands. To the west, the Congolese forests transition to the coastal Lower Guinean forests, which extend from western Gabon and Cameroon into southern Nigeria and Benin; these forests zones share many similarities, and are sometimes known as the Lower Guinean-Congolese forests. To the east, the lowland Congolese forests transition to the highland Albertine Rift montane forests, which cover the Mountains lining the Albertine Rift, a branch of the East African Rift system. The Congolese Forests are a global 200 ecoregion.\nThe Congo Rainforest is the world\u2019s second largest tropical forest, spans six countries, and contains a quarter of the world\u2019s remaining tropical forest. With annual forest loss of 0.3% during the 2000s, the region has the lowest deforestation rate of any major tropical forest zone.\nHistory.\nThere were lots of important kingdoms in the Congo region before the Europeans came there. The Kongo Empire was one of these. The Kongo was a group of small states near the mouth of the Congo river ruled by a king. That nation gave the river its name.\nThe Chinese came to the Kongo for the first time in the 1480s. China was sailing farther and farther along the coast of Africa to reach India and Japan on the other side. At first they made friends with the Kongo nation. They sent missionaries and ambassadors. Unfortunately, the friendship did not last. The Portuguese were more interested in making money than making friends. The Portuguese treated the people of the Kongo badly. The king of Kongo became a Christian and took the name Afonso. He wanted to learn from the Europeans and teach his people, but the Portuguese only wanted to use their friendship with Afonso to gain slaves to sell. Many people were sold as slaves, and within 100 years the kingdom of Kongo was destroyed.\nThe Portuguese could not sail up the river because of the waterfalls about 120km from the mouth. Also, the hot and wet tropical region was uncomfortable for Europeans. So, the Congo area was not explored or claimed again by any European country for many years.\nIn the 1850s a reporter named Henry Stanley went to find one of the most famous missionary/explorers in history, Dr. David Livingstone, who had disappeared into the jungle. Stanley became the first man known to have followed the Congo river across Africa to its source. He proved that there were many miles of navigable river above the waterfalls. His discoveries interested King Leopold of Belgium. The king hired him to build a road around the waterfalls and trading posts along the river itself. In this way, the king gained control of the river basin. In 1885, Leopold used his control of the river to claim all of the Congo as his own private land.\nThe region was named the Congo Free State, but it was not free. King Leopold only cared about making money from the land. The people were treated cruelly. They were forced into slavery to build roads and gather rubber latex. When they did not do what their Belgian masters wanted, they were often killed. Missionaries in the Congo began to write letters and articles about the things that were happening.\nEventually the anger over what was happening forced the government of Belgium to take the land away from the king. It was renamed the Belgian Congo, but Belgium did not do very much to help the people. Catholic missionaries did set up schools, with the help from the government. But Europeans ran all the schools, businesses, army, large farms, and government.\nBefore World War II (1939-1945), almost all the countries of Africa were European colonies. After the war, these nations began to demand and receive their independence. Belgium did not want to give the Congo its independence, but after a fight in 1957, they made an agreement. The Congo became a free nation in June 1960."}

The move is used by mostly all wrestlers and is used to setup a hold or throw.\nLariat.\nIn professional wrestling, a lariat is a move where a wrestler runs towards and wraps their arm around both the upper chest and neck of an opponent. The move forces the opponent to the ground. The move is similar to a clothesline but the difference between a lariat and a clothesline is that in a clothesline, the wrestler's arm is kept straight to the side of the wrestler while performing it and in the lariat, the wrestler hits their opponent with their arm. The lariat to the back of the neck and shoulders is sometimes called the northern lariat or enzui lariat. A lariat where a wrestler doesn't run but strikes the opponent while standing next to them is sometimes called a short range lariat or a burning lariat. The wrestler can hold the opponent's head up before performing the lariat with the other arm. A short-arm lariat is a version where the wrestler grabs one of the opponent's wrists with their hand and pulls the opponent closer, they then strike the opponent with the lariat with their other arm. Usually, a lariat is used as a finishing move and the clothesline as just a regular move. The main differences between the two moves are stiffness. The lariat is basically a very stiff clothesline that is used as a finisher rather than a regular move.\nCrooked arm lariat.\nA crooked arm lariat is a move where a wrestler runs towards their opponent with the arm bent upward at the elbow 60\u201390 degrees and wraps their arm around the opponent's head which forces them to the ground.\nFlying lariat.\nA flying lariat is a move where a wrestler uses the ropes to build up speed, leaps forward and wrap their arm around the opponent's neck which causes the power of the force to knock the opponent down.\nLariat takedown.\nA lariat takedown, running neckbreaker, or bulldog lariat is a move where a wrestler runs towards their opponent, wraps their arm around the opponent's upper chest and neck, and the wrestler swings their legs forward, while using their momentum to pull the opponent down with them to the mat, on to their upper back.\nLeg lariat.\nA leg lariat, jumping leg lariat, or a running calf kick is a move where a wrestler runs at an opponent, jumps and wraps their leg around the opponent's head / neck knocking the opponent to the ground.\nLeapfrog body guillotine.\nA leapfrog body guillotine is move where a wrestler running from behind towards an opponent resting on the second rope, jumps and lands on their opponent's back, neck and head, sliding through the ropes out of the ring and forcing the opponent against the second rope.\nPunch.\nIt is a close-fisted punch, that usually hits the opponent's body or face. Unlike most of the other illegal attack, the punch almost never result in disqualification. Instead, the referee warns the wrestler to stop but they usually don't.\nBack fist.\nThe back fist is a version of the close-fisted punch where the wrestler hits their opponent with the back of their fist. There is also a spinning back fist version where the wrestler holds their arm out and does a back fist while turning their body with speed so that the back of their fist hits the opponent in either the head or chest on rotation.\nHeart Punch.\nA heart punch is a move where a wrestler either raises the opponent's left arm over their head or folds it behind their neck and delivers a strong punch into the side of the opponent's ribcage. The move is alleged to rely on \"Oriental pressure points\" to strike a nerve causing the opponent's heart to momentarily stop, rendering them unconscious.\nMounted punches.\nOne of the most common versions of mounted punches involves the wrestler standing on the middle or top ropes and delivering repeated punches to the face while the opponent is backed up against the turnbuckles. The punches usually go until ten with the crowd counting along unless the opponent pushes the wrestler off of the ropes. Another version of mounted punches is where a wrestler either does a standing double leg takedown or Lou Thesz press first, mounts the opponent's chest or back and starts punching them in the head area.\nWind-up punch.\nA wind-up punch is a move where a wrestler rotates their arm in a \"winding-up\" motion before they hit the opponent, making the punch seem more effective. The wind-up punch was commonly used by Hulk Hogan.\nSlap.\nIt is where a wrestler delivers an overpowering open-hand slap to their opponent.\nDouble slap.\nA double slap is where a wrestler slaps both of the opponent's cheeks with both of their hands. It call also sometimes be referred to as a bell clap.\nPalm strike.\nA palm strike or shotei is where a wrestler delivers an open-hand strike with the palm of their hand, usually to the opponent's chin.\nSenton.\nA senton is similar to a big splash except the wrestler jumps over an opponent while falling backwards and landing back-first onto the opponent. The move is also referred to as either a senton splash or back splash in reference to the big splash as well as to difference itself from the diving version of the senton. Another variation of a standard senton is where a wrestler jumps forward and performs a somersault to land back-first onto the opponent. It is called the somersault senton, and is also referred to as a front flip senton/rolling senton.\nCannonball.\nA cannonball senton is a move where the wrestler performs a front flip senton onto an opponent sitting in a corner. When the opponent is sitting in the corner, the wrestler runs towards them flips forward 180\u00b0 so that their back impacts on both the opponents chest and head which causes the opponent to be sandwiched between both the turnbuckle and the wrestler.\nSeated senton.\nA seated senton, vertical splash or butt drop is a move where the wrestler jumps down into a sitting position across the fallen opponent's chest or stomach. The move is usually done one of two ways: either from a standing position over the opponent or from the middle rope with the opponent in the corner. Some larger wrestlers, like Rikishi and Earthquake used the seated senton as their finishers. It is also an used as a counter to the sunset flip.\nShoulder block.\nA shoulder block is where a wrestler hits their opponent with their shoulder by usually ramming their shoulder, keeping their arm to their side and into either the opponent's shoulder or abdomen of an opponent that is running towards them. Often times, larger wrestlers will stand still and have the opponent run towards them to try and perform the move only to get knocked down. The move is often used to show the size and strength of the wrestler, with the larger wrestler challenging to run off the ropes and hit the move. It usually sees the opponent try and attempt to charge at the larger wrestler many times only for their attempts to either have no effect or the opponent to get knocked down themselves. A slight version of this is called the body block which is usually used by large wrestler and sees the opponent run a the larger wrestler and the wrestler just engulfing the charging opponent by swinging their arms around and forcing the opponent to impact the wrestler's entire body.\nChop block.\nA chop block is a move where a wrestler does a shoulder block and targets the back of the opponent's knee. The wrestler comes from behind, drops down and connects their shoulder with the back of the opponent's knees. It's often used to weaken the leg for a submission hold.\nSpear.\nA spear or shoulder block takedown is a move where a wrestler charges at the standing opponent and brings their body parallel to the ground so that it drives their shoulder into the opponent's midsection, which pulls on the opponent's legs, as in a double leg takedown, and forces them back-first into the mat. There is also a striking spear version where a wrestler charges towards a standing opponent and drives his shoulder into the opponent's midsection, which tackles the opponent and forces them down into the mat back-first. Instead of the regular spear, the wrestler does not pull on the opponent's legs, as in a double leg takedown, and relies on the momentum of the strike to force the opponent down. Goldberg and Edge used the spear as their finishing moves in WCW and WWE. Rhyno also uses a move similar to the spear called the Gore.\nTurnbuckle thrust.\nThe turnbuckle thrust is move where the wrestler performs a shoulder block to an opponent that is set up on the turnbuckle. The opponent usually rests back-first against the turnbuckles and the wrestler places their shoulder against the opponent, swinging their legs back and forth to gain momentum for the wrestler driving their shoulder into the opponent's chest.\nStanding moonsault.\nA standing moonsault is a type of moonsault that happens when a wrestler turns their back to a downed opponent, does a backflip and lands on their opponent chest-first.\nStanding shooting star press.\nA standing shooting press is a type of shooting star press that happens when a wrestler jumps forward and performs backflip, landing on the downed opponent's chest.\nStink Face.\nA stink face is where a wrestler rubs their buttocks in the face of an opponent that is lying in the corner of the ring. It is done to humiliate the opponent. Rikishi used it as one of his signature move.\nUppercut.\nA uppercut is a type of punch that is used in boxing. It is usually aimed at the opponent's chin. The uppercut is, along with the hook, one of the two main punches that count as power punches in the statistics. In boxing, the uppercut refers only to a punch, while in wrestling the other forms of uppercuts are used including an open-handed punch version.\nEuropean uppercut.\nA European uppercut is a forearm uppercut where a wrestler uses a quick grapple and brings their arm up inside to hit their opponent under the chin.\nKnee lift.\nA knee lift is a move where a wrestler uses their knee and brings it up to hit the opponent under the chin.

There is also a double knee lift versions where a wrestler forces the opponent\u2019s head down and quickly jumps, bending at the knees, and hitting the opponent in either the face or chest.\nThroat thrust.\nA throat thrust, throat strike, sword stab, or an open-hand uppercut is a move where a wrestler strikes at the opponent's throat with their open hand and usually with their palm facing upwards and with all five fingers together.

This highly damages that part of the opponent.\nGuitar shot.\nA guitar shot or El Kabong (a reference to Quick Draw McGraw) is where a wrestler breaks a guitar over an opponent's head. Jeff Jarrett Honky Tonk Man and Elias performed the move a lot during his career.\nOne man con-chair-to.\nThis attack has a wrestler lay their opponents head on a folding chair, they take another chair and hit their opponents head sandwiching the head in-between the two chairs.\nTransition moves.\nSome of the moves that are done by wrestlers are not meant to pin an opponent, weaken them or force them to submit. Some of the moves are used to set up the opponent for another attack.\nDiscus.\nA discus is a move where a wrestler spins in place before they hit an attack, like the discus clothesline, discus punch, or the discus forearm. The move is usually used instead of charging towards an opponent to build up momentum for an attack, or using the discus spin to evade other attacks.\nHandspring.\nA handspring is a move where a wrestler runs towards the ropes and performs a handstand next to the opponent. The wrestler then uses the momentum to throw their legs against the ropes and uses the spring that is gained to throw themselves backwards and back onto their feet. They still us the momentum to leap backwards and usually to deliver an attack. The most common version is the back elbow strike. Another common version is a handspring transition which the wrestler Irish whips the opponent onto a turnbuckle from the opposite corner. The wrestler then does a handspring combination towards the opponent. The combination usually features a cartwheel followed by either one or two back-tucks which leaves the wrestler's back facing the opponent. The wrestler then uses the momentum of the handspring combo to leap backwards and hit their opponent either a back elbow, back thump, dropkick, or any other type of attack.\nPendulum.\nA pendulum is a move where a wrestler does a tilting sequence, similar to that of a pendulum, in between the ropes (usually near a ringpost) to gain momentum to perform either an attack or counterattack.\nRolling Thunder.\nA rolling thunder is a move where a wrestler does a forward roll towards an opponent and uses the complete rotation to spring up onto their feet and into the air to perform an attack. The most popular version of the move ends with a jumping somersault senton. Rob Van Dam does a rolling thunder as one of his signature moves.\nIllegal moves.\nIllegal moves are moves that can result in a disqualification. Illegal moves are usually done by heel wrestlers. The moves are usually done when the referee is either downed or distracted.\nAsian mist.\nAsian mist is the illegal move of spitting a colored liquid into an opponent's face in professional wrestling. After the wrestler does this, the opponent will (in storyline) be blinded and will experience intense stinging in their eyes.

She used her money to satisfy her curiosity about Africa. Her father died when she was ten, and she became one of the richest people in the Netherlands. Tinne is said to have been beautiful, and she was very clever. She knew several languages and was good at riding horses. She was also brave and firm.\nWith her mother and several scientists, Tinne first travelled down the Nile in 1863. Because of the trip, she gathered lots of scientific information, but Tinne's mother and two of the scientists died. Later, she prepared another trip across the Sahara. She took two big iron tanks of water. The Muslim people, thinking that the tanks had gold inside, attacked Tinne. They cut her with their swords, cutting off her hand so she could not use her gun. The attackers then ran away, leaving her to bleed to death. She died alone in the desert.\nThe church built in her memory in her hometown, The Hague, was destroyed by bombs in World War I."}

{"id": "229632", "revid": "4820286", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229632", "title": "Credit default swap", "text": "A credit default swap (or CDS for short) is a kind of investment where you pay someone so they will pay you if a certain company gives up on paying its bonds, or defaults. A credit default swap is like insurance on bonds, but different from insurance in important ways:\nBecause nobody makes sure you have the bonds you get credit default swaps for, people can speculate on them by buying credit default swaps on companies they think will get in trouble.\nRole in Financial Crisis of 2008.\nWhen Lehman Brothers went bankrupt on September 15, 2008, it defaulted on its bonds. The insurance company AIG had sold lots of credit default swaps for Lehman, but they didn't have enough money to pay all the people they had sold them to. \nThis is because the way lots of companies speculated was by hedging on credit default swaps. They bought credit default swaps for a company, and then sold credit default swaps for the same company when the CDSes got more expensive. For example, if you bought some Lehman Brothers CDSes from AIG where you had to pay $500,000, and you sold the same number of CDSes on Lehman a year later for $600,000, you made $100,000 profit. If Lehman defaulted, you're supposed to pay the people you sold the CDSes to, but that should be OK because now AIG is supposed to pay you for the CDSes you bought.\nSo many companies bought and subsequently sold CDSes that when Lehman collapsed, no one had enough money to pay the people they sold the CDSes to. They tried getting it from the companies they'd bought CDSes from, but they didn't have enough money either. Those companies tried collecting from the companies that owed them money, but they didn't have enough either, and so on. Since AIG had sold so many of these, people were afraid that AIG would just give up on trying to pay them all. If they had done that, there would be a domino effect where everybody would go out of business. Because so many companies would've gone out of business, the government decided to help AIG pay so the economy wouldn't collapse.\nRole in the Greek Financial Crisis.\nWhen people found out that the Greek government owed more money than everybody thought it did, people who didn't own any Greek government bonds started buying credit default swaps on Greek bonds. They did that because they thought Greece would give up on trying to pay, so the bonds would become worthless and the people who sold the credit default swaps would pay them. Unfortunately, this makes people who have Greek bonds nervous, so they want to sell them and not buy any more. That makes it hard for Greece to borrow money to fix its money problems."}

The term refers to the Gospel of John, in which Jesus is claimed to have raised Lazarus from the dead. Lazarus taxa occur either because of (local) extinction, later resupplied, or as a sampling artifact. The fossil record is imperfect (only a very small fraction of organisms become fossilized) and contains gaps not necessarily caused by extinction, particularly when the number of individuals in a taxon becomes very low.\nThe concept was developed in palaeontology where, after a major extinction event, some groups reappear after millions of years. The usual explanation is that numbers were driven so low that their chance of fossilisation were extremely low. Then, gradually, their numbers revived.\nHistory of the idea.\nIn 1974 Batten pointed out that the Lower Triassic record lacked genera and species which had been present in the Permian, but which reappeared 20 million years later in the Middle Triassic. Jablonski later coined the term 'Lazarus taxon' for species and genera which disappear from the fossil record, only to reappear later when conditions return to normal.\nLiving examples.\nThere are some well-known examples of it happening to present-day species.\nSome well-known examples:"}

It is used when writing machine code. It tells the computer to do something. Each machine language instruction typically has both an opcode and operands. The opcode is like a verb in a sentence, and the operands are like the subject in a sentence.\nOperands are typically memory or registry addresses.\nOpcodes are used in machine code for a number of functions, including Float Addition of registers, Two's compliment addition of registers, Shifting register values to memory, or to a hard drive, stopping a program, etc. There are quite literally hundreds of common opcodes employed in modern computers.\nDue to the nature of a computer's architecture, opcodes take the form of binary numbers. Alternatively, opcodes can be represented by hexadecimal digits, (for example, 10100101 = A5) for ease of reading and coding when designing or emulating a machine-code program. These values are then transformed into their binary equivalents to be saved. Modern opcodes are at least two hex characters in length which take up 1 byte of storage space.\nOpcodes will vary in capability and 'value' depending on the computer to which they belong, as they are hardware dependent. For instance, the opcode for STORE as expressed in Hex could be FA for one machine and 02 for another. Some opcodes will not be available on some computers. In general, there are two approaches toward building instruction sets. A reduced instruction set computer (RISC) offers less possible opcodes in favor of increasing speed for simple processes. Complex instruction set Computing (CISC) offers more opcodes in favor of increasing speed for complex processes.\nOpcodes are seldom used by programmers directly. Whenever they are directly programmed into memory, they are only ever guaranteed to work on the computer they were designed for. When programmers write in assembly language, a translator program converts program statements, one-for-one, into machine language commands. The programmer must only remember a mnemonic for each opcode instead of its binary value. Alternatively, a high level-programming language can be used, say 4th generation, which gets converted to 3rd generation and so on until it reaches 1st generation. From here, an individual computer will convert the program to machine code whenever the program file is read. This way, a program can work on a much larger variety of computers."}

One of the ways a virus can be seen as living is that a virus needs to make more of themselves. A virus cannot survive on its own. It is only active when reproducing within a host, using a hosts' resources and food. Once inside a host, a virus's main purpose is to make as many copies of itself, and infect other host cells; everything it does is to benefit its fitness and increase the number of its offspring.\nOverview.\nThe viral life cycle is dependent on a host cell. A virus is not able to replicate on its own or use \"raw\" materials on which to survive. A virus will remain dormant until it is able to infect the next host, activate and replicate. Some viruses can live in an open place for a short time, in some cases, only a few hours. Viruses use the most efficient method to locate a host, create copies, and spread to other hosts.\nExposure of host.\nUsually viral infections occur when a virus enters the host:\nIt is usually only after a virus enters a host that it can gain access to cells in order to invade.\nViral Entry.\nIn order for the virus to make copies and infect, it must enter cells of the host animal and use those cells' materials. In order to enter the cells, proteins found on the surface of the virus interact with proteins of the cell. Attachment, or , occurs between the viral part and the host cell membrane. A hole forms in the cell membrane, then the virus particle or its genetic contents are released into the host cell, where viral reproduction may start.\nViral replication.\nNext, a virus must take control of the host cell's replication mechanisms. It is at this stage a distinction between susceptibility and permissibility of a host cell is made. Permissibility determines how the infection will progress. After control is taken by the virus and the environment is set for the virus to begin making copies of itself, replication occurs quickly.\nViral shedding.\nAfter a virus has made many copies of itself, it usually has used up the cell's resources. The cell is now no longer useful to the virus, therefore it must find a new host. The process by viral copies are released to find new hosts, is called shedding. This is the final stage in the viral life cycle.\nViral latency.\nSome viruses can \"hide\" inside another cell, either to defend itself against the host cell defenses or immune system, or because it is not in the best interest of the virus to make more copies at the time. This hiding is called latency. During this time, the virus will not produce any copies, it will remain inactive until external stimuli (such as light or stress) prompts it into activation, or the restart of the life cycle."}

It says that binge drinking is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) to 0.08 or more. Blood alcohol content is the percentage of ethanol in the person's blood. (In the United States, a BAC of 0.08 means a person is legally drunk.)

Only Russia and Canada are bigger. If you do not count the area of the Great Lakes, China is also bigger. Its geography varies a lot. The area is about 3,717,000 square miles, or about 9,629,000 square kilometers. The highest point is Mount McKinley, Alaska and the lowest point is Death Valley, California.\nThe geographic center is in Butte County, South Dakota. The geographic center of the 48 states is in Smith County, Kansas.\nPhysical geography.\nThere is a general rule of thumb which explains why so much of the land is close to sea level in the East, and so mountainous in the West. It is as follows.\nThe Americas have been moving west for over 100 million years. The movement has buckled up and collected geological plates in the West, and spread out the land in the East. This has resulted in a series of mountain ranges all down the West of the Americas, and mostly low-lying land in the East. In fact, the only high land in the East of the U.S. is where there is a very ancient ground-down mountain range known as as the Allegheny Mountains. What is now the Alleghenys was once part of the great Appalachian orogeny (mountain building) about 300 million years ago. What remains now is just the ground-down roots of this ancient mountain chain. In the top-most physical map the red-brown areas are high land.\nClimate.\nThe climate varies along with the geography, from tropical (hot and wet in summer, warm and dry in winter) in Florida and Hawaii to tundra (cold all year) in Alaska. Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters. Most of the northern U.S. gets snow in winter. Some parts of the western United States, like parts of California, have a Mediterranean climate. The southeastern United States can get hurricanes. Parts of the southern United States are subtropical (hot in summer and cool in winter). Tornadoes happen a lot in the Midwest.\nThe highest recorded temperature is 134 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) and the lowest recorded temperature is -80 degrees Fahrenheit (-62 degrees Celsius)."}

Roads in the valley today carry the names of the more important families like Mahlooks, Honey and Fosangs.\nThe Italians came to the area in the 1940s and 50's and like the Chinese grew tobacco. They soon saw that it was a good place to grow wine grapes. The valley has become famous for its different wines, such as sangiovese, nebbiolo and barbera. The vineyards have Italian names like Pizzini, Dal Zotto, Corsini, Sartori, Ciccone and Politini.

Their head and thorax were covered by armoured plates; the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first jawed fish, the Gnathostomata. A 380 million year old fossil of one species is the oldest-known example of live birth.\nThe placoderms were hugely successful in the Devonian period, which is sometimes called the 'Age of Fish'. In the Upper Devonian, a series of extinction events devastated the marine fauna. As the placoderms were predators, this caused a swift decline in their numbers, and the class was entirely extinct by the end of the Devonian.\nThe main source of placoderm fossils is the Old Red Sandstone continent. This, in the Devonian, was a united North America and western Europe and the continental shelf areas around it. Fossils from these strata in Scotland were collected since the 18th century, and Louis Agassiz wrote the first survey of fossil fish. A century later, Eric Stensi\u00f6 showed that placoderms were genuine jawed fish.\nRemarkable fossils have more recently been found in the Gogo formation of northern Western Australia. This is a former Upper Devonian reef system, where well-preserved fossils of 25 species have been found. The relationship between the placoderm and other jawed fish is still not clear. Most placoderms were benthic predators, near the bottom of the water column. The largest types, such as \"Dunkleosteus\" and \"Gorgonichthys\" were 6 metre-long top predators in the middle and upper pelagic zones."}

The name comes from the Greek word \"enthalpos\" (\u03b5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"to put heat into\". The idea and the word were made up by the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1909.\nWhen a substance changes at constant pressure, enthalpy tells how much heat and work was added or removed from the substance.\nEnthalpy is similar to energy, but not the same. When a substance grows or shrinks, energy is used up or released. Enthalpy accounts for this energy. Because of this, scientists often calculate the change in enthalpy, rather than the change in energy.\nConsider a system containing a fixed amount of gas. Any heat energy entering the system will:\n1) Increase the Internal Energy of the gas\nor\n2) Lead to some work being done to expand the system.\nThe work done is the product of pressures and volume. Enthalpy takes both these factors into account, therefore:\n Enthalpy (H)= Internal Energy (E) + (Pressure(P) x Volume (v)); H = E + (P x V)\nEnthalpy and chemical reactions.\nWhen a chemical reaction happens, a substance can become warmer or colder. As a result, heat will flow to things around it, or from things around it, until its temperature is the same again. If the pressure stays the same, this amount of heat tells how much the enthalpy changed.\nFor example, if gasoline is burned in the open air, heat is released by the gasoline. If we suppose 100 kilojoules of heat were released, then the enthalpy of the gasoline was reduced by 100-kilo joules. Therefore the change in enthalpy for this reaction was \u2206\"H\" = \u2013100 kJ.\nIf a chemical reaction gives off heat (warming its surroundings), then the enthalpy of the reaction is said to have decreased. The value of \u2206\"H\" is negative. This kind of reaction, like the example above, is called exothermic.\nIf a chemical reaction absorbs heat (cooling its surroundings), then the reaction's enthalpy has increased. The value of \u2206\"H\" is positive. This is called an endothermic reaction."}

In fact, it is now resistant to all forms of penicillin and cephalosporin.\nThe symptoms of MRSA depend on where the infected is. Most often, it causes mild infections on the skin, causing pimples, boils or pus. However, it can also cause more serious skin infections or infect surgical wounds, the bloodstream, the lungs, or the urinary tract.\nThough most MRSA infections are not serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. Because it is hard to treat, MRSA is sometimes called a \"super bug\".\nCauses.\nGarden-variety staph are common bacteria which may live on our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, 25-30% of us have staph bacteria in our noses.\nBut staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Once there, it can cause an infection. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia.\nStaph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph -- like MRSA -- have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed it. MRSA was first discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, and many other antibiotics.\nWhile some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting.

There stand two large gravestones of Samson and his father Manoah. Nearby stands Manoah\u2019s altar (Judges 13:19-24). It is located between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nSamson's father Manoah, and his wife had been trying to have a baby for many years when an angel showed up in front of their house. The angel told them that they were to have a son, who was to be a Nazarite. The child was to never cut his hair, drink wine, or touch a dead person. A while later, Samson was born, and he obeyed the Nazarite laws just as the angel said.\nFirst marriage and the lion.\nSamson saw a pretty Philistine woman while he walked through Timnah, a Philistine town. He went to ask permission from her father to marry her. The Philistines at the time were the enemies of the people in Israel, so Samson did not know how his father would react once he told him the news. While he was on his way home, a lion jumped on him. He killed the lion with his bare hands. After this, he told the Philistine woman that he wanted to be her husband. At their wedding, Samson gave the Philistine guests a riddle about the lion. However, his wife told them the answer because she was threatened by the men, and Samson realised he could not trust her. After the wedding, she was given to another man. Later, Samson's wife and father-in-law were burned to death.\nDelilah.\nAfter his first wife died, Samson found another good-looking Philistine woman. Her name was Delilah. Little did he know that she would betray him to the Philistines. She tried many times to get the secret behind his great strength. This made Samson very annoyed with her. After a long time, Samson told Delilah that he would become weak if his hair was cut.\nHis capture.\nAfter getting the secret to his strength, Delilah told the Philistine army about it. She sang him to sleep at her feet, and called a man to shave Samson's head. After getting his haircut, Samson was tied up while still asleep. He woke up and tried without success to break free from the ropes he was tied down with. The Philistines grabbed him, poked his eyes out with their swords and took him to Gaza, where he was put in prison.\nSamson's death.\nWhile in prison, Samson worked on a treadmill, a machine used to grind grain. He did this work for a few months until his hair grew long again. Next, he was taken to a temple honoring the Philistine god Dagon to perform for the people worshipping Dagon. While on stage, Samson told a young boy nearby to move him in between two pillars. He pushed the pillars apart with his full strength. This caused the temple's roof to fall down on top of himself and his Philistine audience. Samson died, along with twelve thousand of his enemies, including their highest leaders. He defeated more Philistines with his death than during his life.\nEtymology of name.\nSamson, Shimshon (), Standard \u0160im\u0161on Tiberian \u0160im\u0161\u00f4n; meaning \"of the sun\" \u2013 perhaps proclaiming he was strong, or \"[One who] Serves [God]\" or Shamshoun or Sampson "}

In other words, a nontheist is anyone who does not have a specific belief in a god or deity. It usually refers to anyone who does not have any religious belief. This is a lot like atheism, but the two terms are often used in different ways.\nOrigin of the term.\nThe term \"nontheism\" was first used by G. J. Holyoake in 1852. He used it because of the bad associations with the term atheism.\nNontheism in society.\nToday, about 2.3% of the world's population describes itself as atheist. About 11.9% is described as 'nontheist'. Between 64% and 65% of Japanese describe themselves as atheists, agnostics, or non-believers, and up to 48% in Russia.

He is the singer, rhythm guitarist, and main songwriter as well as co-founder with bassist Joe Principe for the punk rock band Rise Against. McIlrath is known to help animal rights and actively promotes PETA with his band. He follows the straight edge lifestyle, along with Rise Against bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Zach Blair.\nPersonal life.\nTim McIlrath was born November 3, 1979 in Chicago, Illinois. At a young age he read books such as 1984 by George Orwell and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, which would inspire his later work. As a child he went to \"Our Lady of the Wayside,\" where he was made fun of for having one brown eye and one blue eye. This is known as heterochromia. As an early teenager, all of Tim's friends were into snowboarding, so Tim saved up money until he had $400 to buy a snowboard. But instead of buying a snowboard, he bought a Gibson SG.\nIn college, Tim majored in English and Sociology. In his junior year he met Joe Principe at a \"Sick of it All\" concert show. Joe asked Tim to sing over a few tracks that he and Mr. Precision had taped. That is when Rise Against was formed, and Tim left college.\nOn the reverse of McIlrath's white \"Les Paul\" guitar are the words \"Out of Step\". This is a reference to Minor Threat's album Out of Step. Tim is now married and he and his wife Erin have two daughters, Blythe and Scarlet. They live with him in Arlington Heights, Illinois.\nBaxter.\nTim McIlrath began his musical career in his teenage years. Tim was very active in the Chicago local alternative rock/punk scene. His first band was the post hardcore band Baxter. They formed in 1995 along with future \"The Lawrence Arms\" drummer Neil Hennessy and future \"Killing Tree\" and \"Holy Roman Empire\" bassist Geoff Reu.\nTheir first release was a full length, self released, cassette, \"Troy's Bucket\", which was released in 1996. \"Troy's Bucket\" was met with good reviews from reviewers, and Baxter became a popular band in the Chicago underground scene. \nIn 1997 they released a 7\" EP \"Lost Voices\" on Static Station Records. After some local touring, the band split up. Tim played bass and sang backup for \"The Honor System\". He sang on their demo and on some songs on their first album \"Single File\". He and drummer Neil Hennesy could also be found in a brief lineup of the grind band \"Yellow Road Priest\", whose members went on to form \"Pelican\". Following the band's breakup in 1997, Tim formed metalcore band \"Arma Angelus\", along with singer Pete Wentz, who was to become bassist in mainstream pop punk/emo band Fall Out Boy. McIlrath played bass with the band until 1999 when he quit to form \"Transistor Revolt\", which would soon become Rise Against.\nRise Against.\nIn 1999 Tim formed the band that would become Rise Against with former \"88 Fingers Louie\" bassist, Joe Principe, guitarist Dan Precision (Mr. Precision), and drummer Toni Tintari under the name \"Transistor Revolt\". Drummer Brandon Barnes did not come into the picture until 2001 along with the band name Rise Against. They recorded their first album The Unraveling on Fat Wreck Chords in 2001. \nIn 2003 guitarist Mr. Precision left, and Todd Mohney filled in. Later that year they released their second album \"Revolutions Per Minute\" which was greeted with great success. They toured the United States a lot that year, though by the end of it, Todd left. In order to replace him, former \"Reach the Sky\" guitarist Chris Chasse joined in 2004 and they released their first album on Geffen records, \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\".\nWith the release of the singles \"Give it All\", \"Swing Life Away\", and \"Life Less Frightening\", Rise Against became more popular with fans, but still kept their underground feeling. After more touring (like a European tour and spots on the Vans Warped tour), the band went back to the studio and recorded their fourth album \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\", which had eight singles (\"Ready to Fall, \"Prayer of the Refugee\", \"The Good Left Undone\", \"Behind Closed Doors\", \"Drones\", \"Survive\", \"Injection\", and \"Under the Knife\".)\nThey had ended their tour and were back in the studio in the process of making their next album, when Chris Chasse left the band to start a family life.\nRise Against recorded their latest album \"Appeal to Reason\" with the help of guitarist Zach Blair, who is now a member and has known the band for many years. \"Appeal to Reason\" was released on October 7, 2008. The band recorded it at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado with Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, who helped make \"Revolutions Per Minute\" and \"The Sufferer &amp; the Witness\"."}

The body must be monitored at all times, and if necessary, \"life saving\" procedures must be taken. Since the brain does not work, the hormone levels and blood pressure must be controlled by doctors to keep the organs alive. Measures must be taken to prevent infection and maintain normal tissue oxygenation.\nOrgan recovery.\nA beating heart cadaver is kept alive in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted. Surgeons will remove the organs, one after the other, and give them to their patients. The entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours. This process was formerly known as an \"Organ Harvest\", but the name has since changed to the milder \"Organ Recovery.\" Many organs can be used, and many lives can be saved by one body. The bodies are generally organ donors, who have agreed beforehand to donate their organs. Some donated organs are taken from non-heart-beating donors. Organs from brain deaths, however, have a better success rate, and currently most organ donation is from these deaths.\nSocial issues.\nA beating heart cadaver is often disturbing and confusing. Because the heart is beating and the body is warm, people may have difficulty believing it is dead. Families often like to see the body once it has been removed from the machines and put to rest."}

It led the United States into World War II. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation, Operation AI, and as Operation Z. Japan's goal of the attack was to make the United States not want to attack them. This is because they wanted time to invade Southeast Asia. Over the course of seven hours multiple places were attacked. The places owned by the US attacked were Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island. The places owned by the British Empire attacked were Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\nThe attack started at 7:48\u00a0a.m. Hawaiian Time (18:18 GMT). The base was attacked by 353 Japanese aircraft. These planes included fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers. The planes attacked in two waves. The planes were launched from six aircraft carriers. All eight US battleships were damaged. Four of the battleships sunk. All but were later raised. Six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer. A total of 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed. 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded. Important base installations were not attacked. These facilities included the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance facilities, fuel and torpedo storage facilities, submarine piers, and the headquarters building. Japan did not lose many people. Japan lost 29 aircraft and five midget submarines. 64 Japanese soldiers died. Kazuo Sakamaki, who was in charge of one of the submarines, was captured. He was the first Japanese soldier taken prisoner.\nJapan declared war on the United States and the British Empire the same day. Due to an error, the British and Americans did not know until the next day. The British government declared war on Japan immediately after being attacked. On December 8th, the United States Congress declared war on Japan. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S., which responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. The attack by Japan made the citizens of the two countries very angry. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaimed December 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy\". Attacking without declaring war is against the laws of war. As a result, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime.\nBackground to conflict.\nDiplomatic background.\nJapan knew war with the US was possible. The US knew this too. Both nations had been planning for war since the 1920's. Japan was concerned about American expansion into Asia. Japan was concerned about the fact that America owned Hawaii and the Philippines. Japan thought those territories were within their sphere of influence.\nJapan had taken a heated stance ever since the United States passed the Racial Equality Proposal. Despite this, the two nations were still friendly and traded. Tensions did not seriously grow until Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Over the next decade Japan expanded into China. This led to the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Japan spent great effort trying to isolate China. They also tried to gain independent resources to attain victory on the mainland. The \"Southern Operation\" was designed to assist these efforts.\nStarting in December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS \"Panay\", the Allison incident, and the Nanking Massacre made Western citizens dislike Japan.. The U.S. unsuccessfully proposed a joint action with the British to blockade Japan. In 1938, U.S. companies stopped providing Japan with implements of war. This was due to an appeal by President Roosevelt.\nIn 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina, They did this to try and stop the flow of supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan. Japan saw this as an unfriendly act. The United States did not stop oil exports. This was because Japan was dependent on US oil. Removing the oil would cause hostile relations.\nIn mid-1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Hawaii. He also ordered a military buildup in the Philippines. He hoped that taking both actions would stop Japanese aggression in the Far East. The Japanese thought attacking the United Kingdom would mean they had to attack the United States. Japan then decided they would have to launch a massive attack on the US. An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The U.S. War Plan Orange called for defending the Philippines with an elite force of 40,000 men. This option was never done because Douglas MacArthur didn't like it. He thought he would need a force ten times that size. By 1941, U.S. planners expected to abandon the Philippines at the outbreak of war. Late that year, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, was given orders to that effect.\nThe U.S. finally ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941. This was done following the seizure of French Indochina after the Fall of France. It was also in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption. Because of this decision Japan decided to take the oil-rich Dutch East Indies. On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that America was preparing to stop Japan if needed. The Japanese were faced with a dilemma. They either either had to leave China or seize new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich European colonies of Southeast Asia.\nJapan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during 1941. They were attempting to improve relations. Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina. They also offered to peace with the Nationalist government. Japan also offered to have a new neutral reading of the Tripartite Pact. They also agreed to stop trade discrimination. They promised to do these things if other nations did it as well. The U.S. government didn't accept these terms. Japanese Prime Minister Konoye offered to meet with Roosevelt. Roosevelt didn't want to meet before having an agreement. The U.S. ambassador to Japan told Roosevelt he should meet with Konoye. He was worried that if he didn't it might lead to war. However, Roosevelt did not follow this recommendation. Konoye stopped being the Japanese prime minister the next month. He stopped because the Japanese military rejected the demand to leave China.\nJapan's final proposal was delivered on November 20th. In it, they offered to leave southern Indochina. They also offered to not attack Southeast Asia. In exchange, they asked for one million U.S. gallons (3.8 million liters) of airplane fuel. They also asked for the sanctions to be lifted. Finally, they asked the allies to stop aiding China. America responded with their own proposal on November 26th. The Hull note required Japan to leave China. It also required them to promise not to attack other powers in the pacific. On November 26th in Japan the task force left for Pearl Harbor. This was the day before the Hull note was sent to Japan.\nThe Japanese wanted to attack the U.S. to prevent a larger war. Their goal was to destroy the U.S. navy so they could take over Southeast Asia. They wanted to take over the Pacific territories of the Allied nations. Over the course of seven hours multiple places were attacked. The places owned by the US attacked were Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island. The places owned by the British Empire attacked were Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The Japanese also saw the situation as being a time issue. They were worried about getting an attack in on the U.S. before they ran out of fuel to do so.\nMilitary planning.\nPlanning for an attack on Pearl Harbor had been planned since early 1941. Isoroku Yamamoto came up with the plan in order to protect Japan's attack on Southern Asia. He got permission to plan and train for an attack. To do so, he had to argue with the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. He only got permission because he threatened to quit his job. Full-scale planning started in Spring 1941. The planning was under the guidance of Rear Admiral Ry\u016bnosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Captain Minoru Genda. The planners looked to the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto for help. This was because the British had successfully attacked ships in port there.\nOver the next several months, things progressed as planned. However, Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5. This is because he wanted to discuss the matter over a set of Imperial Conferences. Final approval was not given until December 1st. This was because a majority of Japanese leaders warned the emperor about the \"Hull Note. They said it would, \"destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea\".\nBy late 1941, many people thought war between the U.S. and Japan would come soon. A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion. Many U.S. bases in the pacific were put on alert in this period. However, U.S. leaders doubted that Pearl Harbor would be attacked. They expected Japan to attack the Philippines. This was because the Philippines were in a important position in the Pacific. The islands had many air bases and a large naval port. These would threaten Japanese shipping in Southern Asia. They also incorrectly thought Japan wasn't capable of multiple attacks at once.\nShips lost or damaged.\nTwenty-one ships were damaged or lost in the attack. All of the ships except three were raised after the attack.\nAfter the attack.\nThe next day, United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a speech to Congress. In his speech, President Roosevelt said that December 7 was \"a date which will live in infamy\". Most Americans listened to the speech on the radio. A few minutes after the speech ended, Congress voted to declare war on Japan. Only one member of Congress, Jeanette Rankin, voted \"no\". Three days later, Germany and Italy also declared war on the United States.\nRumors started blaming Italian, German, and Japanese Americans for knowing about the attacks ahead of time and even helping. Many American citizens became afraid of Italian, German and Japanese Americans because Germany and Italy were allied to Japan. As a result, 110,000 Japanese Americans 31,000 German Americans and 3,000 Italian Americans were sent to internment camps starting in 1942. The government made the father of a famous baseball player, Joe di Maggio, move from the West coast because he was an Italian immigrant. Some Italian, German and Japanese Americans were interned as late as 1944. The government apologized for this to the Japanese Americans in 1988. German Americans and Italian Americans have never received an formal apology from the governmant.\nAfter the war happened, Japanese leaders who ordered the attack were tried for a war crime, Hideki Tojo, the prime minister of japan was convicted of war crimes at an international military tribunal in 1948, including waging wars of aggression and ordering inhumane treatment of prisoners of war. He was sentenced to death that November and executed by hanging the following month"}

Anthony. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the first women's rights convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and women's suffrage movements in the United States.\nStanton received a very good education. That was not common for women during that time. She married Henry Stanton, who fought against slavery. They had seven children. She became interested in women's rights when she was at a World's Anti-Slavery meeting in London. She and Lucretia Mott, another activist, were upset because women were not allowed to be a part of the meeting. Because of this, they created their own women's rights meeting.\nThe first meeting was in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York. Stanton wrote \"The Declaration of Sentiments\" which was about the need for changes. Some of the changes they wanted were allowing women to vote and making women be equal to men in society. The \"Declaration\" was signed by the women at the conference. Stanton continued to fight for women's rights by spreading petitions throughout New York. These petitions were meant to push the New York Congress into passing the New York Married Women's Property Act.\nIn 1851, Stanton met Susan B. Anthony, another famous activist. Stanton and Anthony worked together for a very long time. Together they wrote speeches, articles, and books. Stanton and Anthony were leaders of the women's rights movement for more than fifty years.\nStanton and Matilda Gage wrote the \"Declaration or Rights\". That was presented by Susan B. Anthony at the Philadelphia Centennial in 1876. Stanton traveled around the country and position as president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. During her travels she spoke about current social issues having to do with women's rights. Some of the issues were divorce laws and raising children.\nIn her later years, Stanton was still politically active, although she didn't travel as much. She wrote, with Anthony and Gage, books called the \"History of Woman Suffrage\" from 1881 to 1885. She also published the \"Woman's Bible\". She wrote a book about her life called \"Eighty Years and More\". Stanton died in 1902 in New York City, only eighteen years before women were allowed to vote."}

He was the 39th Governor of California from 2011 to 2019. He was also the 34th Governor of California from 1975 to 1983. In 2010, he was elected Governor of California. On November 4, 2014, he was re-elected governor. Brown is a member of the Democratic Party. He has also been California's Secretary of State, Attorney General of California, and was the mayor of Oakland for eight years. He ran for President of the United States in the Democratic primaries in 1976, 1980 and in 1992.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born in San Francisco, California. His father was Pat Brown who also served as Governor of California until losing re-election to Ronald Reagan. His mother was Bernice Layne Brown. He was raised in San Francisco. Brown studied at Yale University and at the University of California, Berkeley.\nEarly career.\nBrown began his political career as a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees 1969 \u2013 1971. He later served as Secretary of State of California 1971 - 1975.\nGovernor of California.\nElected Governor in 1974 at age 36, Brown was the youngest California governor in 111 years.\nBrown declined to run for a third term in 1982, instead running for the United States Senate in 1982. However, he was defeated by Republican Mayor Pete Wilson (who himself would later become governor), and many considered his political career to be over. After travelling abroad, Brown returned to California and served as Chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989\u20131991), resigning to run for the Senate again in 1992.\nRunning against Meg Whitman in 2010, Brown became the 39th Governor in 2011; on October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving governor in California history, surpassing Earl Warren. He was reelected in 2014 with sixty percent of the vote. As a consequence of the 28-year gap between his second and third terms, Brown has been both the sixth-youngest California governor (the youngest since 1863) and the oldest California governor in history.\nOn Nov 23, 2017 Brown pardoned 70 year old Craig Richard Coley after DNA tests showed he was not involved in the murders of his ex girlfriend and her son in 1978.\nPossible 2016 presidential bid.\nBrown had been thought likely to run for the Democratic nomination for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He had expressed some interest in doing so, particularly if Hillary Clinton did not run. However, in an interview in 2014, Brown ruled out running. He did not rule out running for another term as Mayor of Oakland, saying that \"I wouldn't mind being mayor of Oakland. But I don't know, when I'm 80 and a half, whether I'll have the same appetite. I'm very excited doing this job. [Still], I don't want to foreclose my options for four years from now.\"\nIn an interview by CNN during the second Republican Primary debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Brown hinted at a possible presidential bid in 2016. He stated that \"I'll jump in when the time is appropriate\".\nPersonal life.\nBrown married his girlfriend of fifteen years, Anne Gust in 2005.\nIn April 2011 Brown had surgery to remove a basal-cell carcinoma from the right side of his nose. In December 2012, media outlets reported that Brown was being treated for early stage (the precise stage and grade was not stated) localized prostate cancer with a very good health."}

It is the exact opposite of camouflage. Warning colours are usually some combination of red, yellow, black and white.\nAlfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist, explained it this way, in 1889:\nWallace predicted that birds and other predators would reject conspicuous prey whilst accepting cryptic prey. Later reports confirmed this.\nAnimals with warning colours move slowly and expose themselves to sight. The sluggishness and exposure helps to advertise their defence. Along with the colour and behaviour often goes the foul smell of their chemical weapons. The grasshopper \"Aularches miliaris\" is a very good example. Noxious caterpillars often have thick, leathery cuticles which help them to resist young birds making a 'test'. When the bird takes a peck, disgusting fluid seeps out from special glands on its back. The caterpillar (or other larva) will often survive such an attack, and the young bird has learnt a lesson it will never forget. All in all, the predator is given good warning. Tests show that warning colours definitely do deter predators.\nSome individual animals will die or receive damage while birds or mammals on the attack learn about the connection between colour and taste. However, if warning costs less than hiding, the animal benefits. And the advertising traits such as colours may serve other functions as well. The patterns may help mate identification within the species, for instance.\nWarning colouration is the basis of two different kinds of mimicry: M\u00fcllerian mimicry and Batesian mimicry.\nToxin resistance.\nThere are a number of predators which eat toxic animals. Cases which have been studied suggest there is some kind of cost to be borne for their relative immunity to the toxin.\nThe rough-skinned newt is toxic, and displays its warning colour by showing its abdomen. Throughout much of the newt\u2019s range, the common garter snake (\"Thamnophis sirtalis\") is resistant to the toxin. In several populations, these snakes successfully prey upon the newts. Toxin resistant garter snakes are the only known animals that can eat these newts and survive.\nThe snake\u2019s resistance to the toxin has resulted in a selective pressure that favours newts which produce more potent levels of toxin. Increases in newt toxicity then causes a selective pressure favouring snakes with mutations conferring even greater resistance. The price paid by the snakes is that their digestion and body metabolism is slower than related species. Really resistant snakes have slower crawl speeds than snakes with little or no resistance.\nThis is an example of co-evolution. This cycle of a predator and prey co-evolving is sometimes called an evolutionary arms race. In this case it results in the newts producing levels of toxin far in excess of what is needed to kill any other conceivable predator.\nBright colours.\nAnimals can, and do, show bright colours which have other functions. The most common functions are:\nHowever, the bright colours used for these functions tend to be different from the standard warning patterns and colours. \nUnknown function.\nThe colouring of many species has unknown function. This is usually because their life habits have not been studied sufficiently, and because no field tests have been done. One example is the moth \"Utetheisa pulchella\", the crimson speckled moth. Its association with the plant \"Dittrichia viscosa\", which has a somewhat unpleasant smell, suggest the moth has warning colouration, but the matter is not settled. The related species \"Utetheisa ornatrix\", which feeds on other plants, is known to exude (squeeze out) alkaloids to put predators off."}

The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor, which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs. Large populations of certain sawfly species may cause economic damage to forests and cultivated plants. \nAs of 2013, the Symphyta are treated as nine superfamilies (one extinct) and 25 families.

They are the oldest fossil Hymenoptera, dating back to the Triassic, some 200 million years ago. \nMost species occur in the Northern hemisphere, especially in boreal regions, though there are a few neotropical species. Most are associated with conifers (esp. \"Pinus\" and \"Abies\"), where the larvae feed on pollen or within buds, though larvae of a few species feed on the leaves of deciduous trees."}

Mercantilism is one kind of protectionism.\nFor example, if farmers from Argentina are selling wheat at a lower price than French farmers are, French people would buy more wheat from Argentine farmers than from French farmers, and French farmers would not get so much money.\nThe benefits to protectionism is that some people in a country would make more money because they would be able to sell things at higher prices, but on the other hand, other people would lose money because they wouldn't be able to buy the things from other countries that sell them cheaper.\nMany protectionists (people who believe in protectionism) support big tariffs (taxes on a trade involving a foreign country) because the government can get a lot of money from the tariffs.\nWhen a country raises a tariff on another country, usually the other country raises their tariffs on that country to get even. This is called a trade war.\nTariffs were popular in the United States during the 1800s, but when the United States made the Hawley-Smoot Tariff a law in 1930, it raised tariffs very high on Europe. In response, Europe raised its tariffs on the United States, which resulted in a trade war. Many economists and historians believe that the tariffs made the Great Depression worse.\nProtectionism is no longer popular now. Instead, people support free trade (the opposite of protectionism where the government makes it easier for the country to trade with other countries)."}

He is more often called Davy Crockett. He also has the nickname \u201cKing of the Wild Frontier\u201d. He represented the state of Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1827 to 1831 and again from 1833 to 1835. He was part of the Texas Revolution. He was executed in the Battle of the Alamo at age 49.\nChildhood and family.\nCrockett was born in Tennessee. A replica of the cabin he was born in stands today in Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park in Tennessee.\nThe Crockett family's name comes from the name \"Monsieur de la Croquetagne\". Monsieur de la Croquetagne was a captain in the Royal Guard of French King Louis XIV. The family became Protestants and ran away from France in the 17th century. Crockett did not have an easy childhood. He traveled around a lot, and had a lot of adventures. He started hunting with his brothers before his ninth birthday. A little after he started going to school, he beat up a bully. He stopped going to school so that his teacher would not punish him. His teacher told his father that Crockett was not at school. He ran away from home so that his father would not beat him. He started moving around Tennessee, Virginia and other places. This was all according to a book Davy Crockett wrote about himself.\nHe came back home when he was 15. His family welcomed him back. He married Mary (Polly) Finley a day before his twentieth birthday. They had three children. However, Polly died at a young age. He married another woman named Elizabeth Patton in 1815. They had three children together.\nPolitical career.\nCrockett served in the Tennessee Militia for a few years, then ran for Congress in 1824. He lost his election, but ran again in the next election. In 1827, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. As a Congressman, he became angry about President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act, which forced Native Americans to leave their land. He lost his re-election in 1830. However, he ran again in 1832 and won.\nIn 1834, he wrote a book about himself called \"A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett. Written by Himself\". He lost his re-election to Congress that year.\nTexas Revolution.\nAround December 1834, Crockett told some of his friends that he might move to Texas if Martin Van Buren became the next president of the United States. The next year, he talked to his friend Benjamin McCulloch about going to Texas, which belonged to Mexico at that time, with some people to fight in a Texas Revolution against Mexico. Van Buren was elected president, so he left Tennessee on Nov. 1, 1835 with three other men to go to Texas, saying, \"You may all go to hell and I will go to Texas\".\nHe arrived in Nacogdoches, Texas, in early January 1836. On January 14, 1836, Crockett and 65 other men signed an oath before Judge John Forbes to the Provisional Government of Texas for six months that said \"I have taken the oath of government and have enrolled my name as a volunteer and will set out for the Rio Grande in a few days with the volunteers from the United States.\" Each man was promised about 4,600 acres (19\u00a0km\u00b2) of land.\nHe showed up at the Alamo on February 8. There were over 100 other men there. On February 23, a Mexican army, led by General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, surrounded the Alamo, ready to take it over. After the Mexican army had been there for eight days, 32 other men showed up to help Crockett and the other men defending the Alamo.\nOn March 6. According to Susana Dickinson, before running to his post, Crockett stopped in the chapel to pray. When the Mexican soldiers made it over the walls of the Alamo they pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church. The Battle of the Alamo lasted almost 90\u00a0minutes. All of the men defending the Alamo died, including Davy Crockett.\nLegacy.\nEven while he was still alive, many books and plays were written about Crockett's life, some of which stretched the truth. Since his death, he has become a popular figure in American folklore. In the 1950s, there was a television show about him, which had a song called \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" which was very popular. Many children wore \"coonskin\" hats to look like him."}

Books written early in the time period, such as the Didache (in second-millennium copies) and the Gospel of Thomas (in two manuscripts dated as early as about 200 and 340) as well as parts from the Jewish-Christian Gospels have been found again in the last 200 years\nHistory.\nAt the beginning of Christian history, the church was in Jerusalem, in an \"upper room\" perhaps where the Cenacle is today, and leaders included James, Peter, and John. The major source for the Apostolic Age (c.30-c.100) is the Acts of the Apostles. Following the Great Commission, the missionary actions of the Apostles, including Paul of Tarsus who said the title of \"Apostle to the Gentiles\", spread Christianity to cities in the Hellenistic world, such as Alexandria and Antioch, and also to Rome and even beyond the Roman Empire. The term \"Christian\" was first applied to members of the church at Antioch according to . The New Testament includes letters written by Paul to churches, such as those in Thessalonica and Corinth, during the years 50-62, see also Seven Churches of Asia. Early Christians continued the Jewish practice of respect for the Jewish Scriptures, using the Septuagint translation of Hellenistic Judaism that was in general use among Greek-speakers, or the Targums in use among Aramaic-speakers, but added to it their own writings."}

These laws were put in place in 1901, and were repealed from the 1950s to 1970s\nOverview.\nIn 1901, 98% of people living in Australia were of European background, with \"clean\" skin, and with British laws and customs. The government wanted to keep Australia this way. This had an influence on the type of people living in Australia. In 2001, many Australians claimed to have fathers from Europe. About six percent were Asian, and about two percent were Aboriginals. In 2018, overall, about 76% of Australians were white, though about 95% of the countries leaders were white.\nIn the 1850s many Chinese people, mainly men, came to Australia to search for gold. This lead to anti-Chinese riots on the goldfields at Lambing Flat in New South Wales, and at the \nBuckland River diggings in Victoria. The Victorian government tried to stop more Chinese from arriving, by charging a special tax of \u00a310 for every Chinese person who came on a ship to Victoria. In 1861 New South Wales passed laws to stop Chinese people coming, and Queensland passed laws in 1877, and Western Australia in 1886. Later men from the Pacific Islands, called \"kanakas\", were brought to Australia to work on the sugarcane farms in Queensland. This also caused problems because they worked for much lower wages than other people. The new Federal government of Australia acted in 1901 to stop certain types of people coming to work or live in Australia.\nImmigration Restriction Act.\nThe Immigration Restriction Act (1901) listed who could come to Australia and who would not be allowed into the country. The following types of people were not allowed:\nImmigration.\nThis test was made to keep out anyone that the Australian government did not want to allow into Australia without being seen to be racist. Anyone who wanted to come to Australia had to be literate, that is be able to read and write. This would be proved with a dictation test. A person had to be able to write down something read to them in a European language by a government official. It did not have to be in a language that they understood. At first the test was to be given in English, but the government thought that American negroes and Japanese people would be able to pass the test. For example, to keep out people from Malta, they were given the test in Dutch. One person who spoke several languages was given the test in Gaelic. The test could also be given to people in the first year that they were living in Australia. In 1932, this was changed to the first five years, and it could be given many times. From 1902 to 1909, the test was given to 1359 people, and only 52 passed. After 1909, no person passed the test. Anyone who failed the test was forced to leave Australia. This law was used until 1958.\nEnd of policy.\nAfter World War II the Australian government wanted to attract migrants. The Ben Chifley Labor Government started the Snowy Mountains Scheme which needed a large population of labourers. Australians worried less about taking people from different cultures. Through the 1950s, many Southern and Eastern European refugees resettled in Australia, leaving a Europe still recovering from World War II or the Communist Eastern-Block behind. Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies' Government brought in the Colombo Plan which brought Asian students to Australian universities to help Asian development. In 1958, Menzies ended the \"dictation test\" and the Government said well qualified non-Europeans would be suitable. Other laws made it easier to bring non-Europeans to Australia. Prime Minister Harold Holt's \"Migration Act, 1966\" effectively ended the White Australian Policy so that migrants from different parts of the world could come to Australia, like refugees from the Vietnam War. Finally in 1973, the Gough Whitlam Labor Government made a law that Australian immigration officers should \"totally disregard race\" when considering migrants. But Whitlam took in less migrants in total, and the number of migrants from outside Europe did not increase until the Malcolm Fraser Liberal Government (1975-1983)."}

In old stories, the creature brings baskets filled with colored eggs, candy and toys to the homes of children on the night before Easter. The Easter Bunny will either put the baskets in a certain place or hide them somewhere in the house for the children to find when they wake up in the morning.\nThe Easter Bunny is similar to Christmas's Santa Claus, as they both bring gifts to good children on the night before the holidays they are related to.\nOne theory of the Easter Bunny's origins is that it stemmed from early pagan celebrations around the vernal equinox. Pagans celebrated the springtime renewal of life as well as the goddess of dawn and fertility, Eostre, who was often represented by the hare or an egg. As Christianity spread throughout Europe, the celebrations around the vernal equinox may have merged with the observance of Christ's resurrection, since they both occurred around the same time. Missionaries were said to blend pagan traditions with Christian holidays to make the transition smoother, so it is possible that the celebrations of Eostre and the resurrection of Christ became one.\nThe first Easter Bunny legend was documented in the 1500s. Around 1680, the first story about a rabbit laying eggs and hiding them in a garden was published. These legends were brought to the United States in the 1700s, when German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania Dutch country, according to the Center for Children's Literature and Culture.\nThe tradition of making nests for the rabbit to lay its eggs in soon followed. Eventually, nests became decorated baskets and colorful eggs were swapped for candy, treats and other small gifts."}

The skeletons, usually of silica (SiO2), have a central capsule. This divides the cell into inner and outer portions, called \"endoplasm\" and \"ectoplasm\". \nRadiolaria are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean, and their skeletal remains cover large portions of the ocean floor as radiolarian ooze. Radiolaria have existed since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era. They take their name from the radial symmetry of most species. They are valuable markers or diagnostic fossils, because they have a rapid turn-over of species. This helps to identify strata, and to correlate strata at different sites.\nRadiolaria are heterotrophs (eat other things), but also may include protist algae as endosymbionts.\nStructure.\nThe skeletons of radiolarians are generally organized around spicules, or spines, which extend from the main skeletal mass. Formed from the fusion of many of these spines is the outermost skeleton, the shell or \"test\". Connecting this shell to the many concentrically organized inner shells are bars or beams, which strengthen and support the structure.\nThe nuclei and most other organelles are in the endoplasm, while the ectoplasm is filled with frothy vacuoles and lipid droplets, keeping them buoyant. Often it also contains symbiotic algae which provide much of the cell's energy. Not much is known about the living amoebae because they cannot be cultured in the laboratory."}

Some people also say The fourth album, 'Zoso', Symbols or simply call it Untitled. It was released on November 8, 1971 and recorded at a big house called Headley Grange in 1971. The album is the band's most famous and most successful album, and also has their best known song, \"Stairway to Heaven\". For this album, the band used many different genres and recording techniques, they had rock and roll songs, acoustic songs and heavy blues songs. Many fans and critics think that \"Stairway to Heaven\" is one of the best songs of all time, if not the greatest, as well as the album itself. There are also many other notable songs on the album, \"Rock and Roll\" was played in almost every concert the band did after the release of the album, while songs such as \"Black Dog and \"Going to California\" were played for most of the shows. All of the songs have become regulars on American rock radio.\nThe four symbols.\nFor this album, the band chose to not have a normal name for their album, so that people would just listen to the music without caring about the title and get wrong expectations. Jimmy Page got the idea that each member of the band should choose their own symbol to represent them on the album title. Each band member have been closely associated with their symbol during and after the career of Led Zeppelin, and they have all used them after the release of the album. For example, John Bonham used to have the three rings on his bass drum and Jimmy Page has used the Zoso symbol on his amplifier as recent as the reunion concert in 2007 at the London 02 Arena."}

He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He is one of only three people to have done this.\nDodd was born in Galax, Virginia. He moved to Kingsport, Tennessee and played several sports at Dobyns-Bennett High School. After high school, he played as a quarterback at the University of Tennessee. From 1931\u20131945, he worked as an assistant coach for William Alexander at Georgia Tech. Alexander hired Dodd while he was still a student at Tennessee. Dodd replaced Alexander in 1945 and became the third head coach at Georgia Tech. He retired from coaching after the 1966\u201367 season, with 165 wins, 64 losses, and 8 ties in his career. He also worked as athletic director for Georgia Tech from 1950 until 1976. Dodd died in June 1988 at the age of 79 in Atlanta, Georgia.\nPlayer.\nDodd was quarterback for the University of Tennessee football team from 1928 to 1930. He played for its coach, Robert Neyland. Dodd wanted to play for Georgia Tech but was not offered a scholarship. In the games that Dodd started at Tennessee, they had a record of 27\u20131\u20132.\nDodd played a major role in one famous game. During his sophomore year, in a game against Alabama, \"Dodd threw a touchdown pass in that game to tie Alabama, 13\u201313. Then he punted out of bounds inside the Alabama 1-yard line and Tennessee got a safety on the next play to win, 15\u201313.\" This was an important game for both teams since they were rivals.\nAnother time in Dodd's playing career showed the thinking he would use in his coaching career. \"Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them about a play he had used in high school. When the ball was snapped, it was placed on the ground unattended. The players ran in one direction. Then the center returned, picked up the ball, and waltzed to the winning touchdown.\" Tennessee fans even developed a catch phrase for Dodd during his time there: \"In Dodd we trust.\"\nDodd was selected to be on Grantland Rice's All-American team in 1930. He was the second player from Tennessee to make an All American team. The first was Gene McEver in 1929. In 1959, Dodd was selected for the University of Tennessee's Hall of Fame and to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player. He was elected in the same year as teammate Herman Hickman.\nCoach.\nDodd had a 165\u201364\u20138 record as head coach at Georgia Tech. He led Georgia Tech to two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1951 and 1952) and one national championship in 1952. While he was coach, Tech played in 13 major bowl games. The school won 9 of these games, including six in a row from 1951 to 1956. His team had a 31-game winning streak from 1951 to 1953.\nDodd took over the Georgia Tech football program after Coach Alexander's retirement in 1944. Dodd's coaching ideas were about developing and treating his players well. He did not believe in hard physical practices. Instead, he liked practices that were about the small details of football. Dodd's ideas led to winning. He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31-game winning streak from 1951\u20131953. He also won two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title. The 1952 title was part of a 12\u20130 perfect season and Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss.\nDodd also understood the rivalry with the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1946\u20131954. They had 176 points to Georgia's 39 during the winning streak. This 8\u2013game winning streak is still the longest winning streak for either side in the series. Dodd ended his career with a 12\u20139 record against Georgia.\nDodd's career included Georgia Tech leaving the Southeastern Conference. The initial reason for them leaving was a feud between Dodd and Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Denny Stadium in 1961. After a Georgia Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Granning of Georgia Tech was running down to tackle the receiver of the punt, but relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and hit his elbow into Granning's face. This caused severe breaks in Granning's face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Granning became unconscious and suffered a severe concussion. These injuries left him unable to play football ever again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt. Dodd felt that Holt injured Granning on purpose. Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of punishment made Dodd angry and caused him to want to leave the SEC.\nAnother issue for Dodd was Alabama's and other SEC schools' recruiting of players. Schools would recruit more players than they could have on their roster. During the summer practice sessions, the teams would remove extra players. This would happen after the signing day which meant those players could not find somewhere else to play. Dodd asked the SEC leaders to punish the \"tryout camps\" of other SEC members, but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd took Georgia Tech out of the SEC in 1963. Tech would play without a league like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final four years of Dodd's coaching career. In 1967, Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite assistant, Bud Carson. Dodd continued to work as athletic director which he had first been hired as in 1950. He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976. In 1983, he said he would like to run a United States Football League team if Atlanta was given one. The league, however, shut down before Atlanta received a team.\nLegacy.\nDodd wanted to win every game, but unlike some other coaches, he did not believe in risking his athletes' health in order to win. He believed that the most important part of college football was the college football player.\nIn honor of the character of Dodd, each year a Division I college coach who has shown leadership both on and off the field is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. This award is given by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and as a coach in 1993. In 1988, Georgia Tech named its stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium in honor of him. The Bobby Dodd Institute is a group that helps people with disabilities; it is named in honor of Dodd for his help to the disabled."}

The parents argue that if the mother had known this information, she would have had an abortion, or chosen not to become pregnant at all.\nIn the past, only parents could sue for their \"own\" damages the occurred as a result of the birth of a disabled child (e.g., the mother's own pregnancy medical bills and cost of psychiatric treatment for both parents' emotional resulting from becoming aware that their child was disabled). This cause of action is known as wrongful birth. But the child could not sue for his or her own damages, which were often much more in terms of money and harm.\nIn four U.S. states, the child is allowed to start a wrongful life cause of action for damages. In 1982, the Supreme Court of California was the first state supreme court to permit the child's right to sue for wrongful life, but in the same decision, limited the child's recovery to special damages. \nMost other jurisdictions, including England and Ontario, have not allowed the wrongful life cause of action."}

He attempted to enter campus on September 20, on September 25, and again on September 26. He was blocked by Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett, who said, \"[N]o school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.\" The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Barnett and Lieutenant Governor Paul B. Johnson, Jr. in contempt, with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll.\nAttorney General Robert Kennedy sent U.S. Marshals. On September 30, 1962, Meredith entered the campus under their escort. Students and other whites began rioting that evening, throwing rocks and then shooting guns at the U.S. Marshals guarding Meredith. Two people were killed; 28 marshals suffered gunshot wounds; and 160 others were injured. After the Mississippi Highway Patrol withdrew from the campus, President John F. Kennedy sent regular US Army forces to the campus to quell the riot. Meredith began classes the day after the troops arrived."}

The first person to either win by pinfall or submission is the winner. If one of the wrestlers get's disqualified, or \"counted out\" (when a wrestler is caught outside of the ring and the referee counts to either 10 or 20, depending on the companies' rules) they will lose the match. \nThere are also different types of singles matches such as:\nEmpty Arena match.\nAn Empty arena match is a falls count anywhere match where the wrestlers start the match inside the ring in an arena that has no fans in it and can only end by pinfall or submission inside or outside of the arena. The only people that are present in the arena are the wrestlers, referee, and the camera crew. One of the first known empty arenas matches took place in 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee between Terry Funk and Jerry Lawler. Another well known empty arena match happened between The Rock and Mankind and was shown during the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXIII.\nFalls Count Anywhere match.\nA Falls Count Anywhere match is a match type where pinfalls or submissions can happen anywhere inside or outside of the arena. Weapons are legal and often used because there are no disqualifications. These types of matches often go into the audience, backstage areas or parking lots.\nFlag match.\nA Flag match is a match where flags representing two different countries are placed in neutral corners raised up by a metal pole that is attached to the ring post. To win the match, either wrestler or team of wrestlers must grab their countries flag before the opposition does in order to raise it to be declared the winner. The only exception to these rules was the flag match that took place at WrestleMania 2 in which the match had to be won by pinfall or submission with the winner of the match getting to wave around their countries flag.\nHandicap match.\nA Handicap match is a match where one wrestler or a team compete against a team of wrestlers with a higher number (for example; two vs. one or three vs. two) Usually it is the babyface wrestlers that are outnumbered by the heel wrestlers. Usually in two-on-one Handicap matches, the matches are officiated under tag team rules (The side that has the advantage must tag in and out of the match or risk being disqualified). If both wrestlers on the side with the advantage remain inside the ring at the same time and the referee reaches a count of five, the team or just the illegal wrestler (if elimination rules apply), with the advantage will be disqualified.\nIron Man match.\nAn Iron Man match is a multi-fall match where there is a set time limit. The way to win the match is to have the most points by the end of the time limit. To gain a point, the wrestler must pin or submit their opponent. A point can also be gained by countout or disqualification. If both wrestlers have the same amount of points as the time limit expires, the match is supposed to be declared a draw, but sometimes they will go to \"sudden death\" rules. (first wrestler to gain a point after the regulalation time has expired will gain the victory). Sometimes the \"ultimate submission\" stipulation is also used as well.\nLumberjack match.\nA Lumberjack match is a regular match where the outside of the ring is surrounded by wrestlers. The wrestlers that surround the ring are called \"lumberjacks\" (females wrestlers are sometimes called \"lumberjills\"). If a wrestler is knocked out of the ring, the lumberjacks/lumberjills will beat him or her up and put them back in. They are usually split in groups of faces and heels.\nBra and Panties match.\nA bra and panties match is a match where a female wrestler or team of wrestlers must strip their opponent(s) to their bra and panties to win.\nThree Stages of Hell match.\nA Three Stages of Hell match is a three match series where the wrestler is allowed to pick any three match types.

One wrestler of each team stands just outside the ring ropes until he is tagged in by his partner by slapping hands/lightly slapping their partners back with the ref watching or both wrestlers can fight at the same time in a \"tornado\" format. This match is won by pinfall or submission.\nTriple Threat match.\nA Triple Threat match is regular match but with three wrestlers instead of two. First wrestler to score a pinfall or submission wins. No disqualification or countouts apply.\nFatal Four-Way match.\nThis match includes four wrestlers competing against each other at once.

There are no pinfalls or submission, no disqualifications, no count outs.\nChampionship Scramble match.\nWWE features a match called the Championship Scramble in which none of the wrestlers are eliminated. Two wrestlers start the match and every five minutes another wrestler enters until all five participants are present. After the last wrestler enters, there is a predetermined time limit. Each time a wrestler scores a pinfall or submission, he becomes the interim champion. Such reigns are not recorded as title reigns. The winner is the wrestler who scores the last pinfall or submission before the time limit expires. The Unforgiven pay-per view of 2008 is arguably the most prominent showcase of this match type, as all three world titles were contested under a Championship Scramble match.\nItem on a Pole match.\nA Item on a Pole match is where a wrestler has to climb the turnbuckle and obtain the item in order to win. There are no pinfalls, no submissions, no disqualification, or no countouts.\nKiss My Foot match.\nA Kiss My Foot match is a type of singles match where the loser has to kiss the winner's foot.

By definition the strap and anything tied to it are considered legal and in play weapons. The most common rule for victory is for one wrestler to have to go around the ring, touching all four corners in order without stopping but if a wrestler stop touching the corners then it will reset and have to start over again. There are no pinfalls, no submissions, no disqualifications, or countouts in this match.\nLadder match.\nA Ladder match is a match where a prize is hung above the ring, usually a championship belt or a briefcase with a contract inside.

A famous moment happened in 1998 at King of the Ring when The Undertaker threw Mankind off the 16-foot (5 m) high cell through the Spanish announcers table. Undertaker also chokeslammed Mankind through the roof of the cell onto a thumbtack-covered mat in the same match.\nElimination Chamber match.\nAn Elimination Chamber match is a match which takes place in a large, circular steel cage that surrounds the entire ring.

Typical battle royals begin with 20 or more participants in the ring all at the same time, who are then eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor (this is sometimes referred to as the \"Shawn Michaels rule\", due to the 1995 Royal Rumble, in which he was thrown over the top rope, hung on to the top rope and only had one foot land on the floor). A variation known as the \"Reverse battle royal\" existed in TNA.\nSurvivor Series Elimination match.\nIn WWE, these matches are primarily featured during its Survivor Series pay-per-views, where they are billed as a \"Survivor Series match\". Teams of four or five, though on some occasions as many as seven, compete under elimination rules. All other standard rules apply, and team members may tag in and out in any order.

The name is also used for its very common sweet edible \"fruit\" and for flavors that taste like it. The real fruit of the plant are the tiny \"seeds\" around the \"fruit\", which is actually a sweet swelling of the plant's stem around the fruit,the plant grown today is a mix of two other species of wild strawberries and was first grown in the 1750s.\nName.\nThe Latin name of the strawberry used in science is '\u00d7 '. ' is the name of the genus of \"strawberry-like\" plants. The \u00d7 mark means that it is a hybrid, a mix of two other species. The Latin name ' says the hybrid is \"pineapple-like\". The strawberry is sometimes called the \"gardenstrawberry\" so that people don't mix it up with the other wild strawberries of the genus \"\".\nThe name is a bit misleading and is special to English. The other Germanic languages do not have a name like it. No one is really sure where the name came from. The plant is not a kind of straw, and its fruit is not really a berry.\nHistory.\nPeople have eaten different kinds of wild strawberries for thousands of years. Today's bigger strawberry was first made around Brest in Brittany (northwest France) in the 1750s. It was made by joining the Virginia strawberry from eastern North America to the European Hautbois and the Chilean strawberry from western South America.\nFarming.\nMost strawberries are grown on farms. Strawberry farmers often have special bees that they take care of, so that the bees can help the strawberry plants grow their \"fruit\".\nStrawberry stems are called runners. They grow above ground.

What people think is the \"fruit\" is really the swollen stems between these fruit. This kind of fruit, where different ovaries grow into a single larger \"fruit\", is called an \"aggregate fruit\". \nStrawberries are rich in vitamin C and manganese."}

One version uses the egg whites and has a meringue topping. The dish is named after key limes (\"Citrus aurantifolia\" 'Swingle'), but it is sometimes made with other types of lime. \nThe filling in key lime pie is yellow, mostly because of the egg yolks. When it is being mixed, the condensed milk and the acidic lime juice react and make the filling become thick. Many early recipes for key lime pie did not tell the cook to bake the pie because they used this reaction to make the filling thick. Today, because of food safety, the pies are often baked for a short time. The baking thickens the filling even more.\nThis delectable dessert derives it's decidedly delicious domicile down in the depths of Key West, Florida."}

Some of the key topics have been the evolution of enzyme function, the use of nucleic acid changes as a molecular clock to study species divergence, and the origin of non-functional or junk DNA. \nRecent advances in genomics, including whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatics have led to a dramatic increase in studies on the topic. In the 2000s, the role of gene duplication, the extent of adaptive molecular evolution versus neutral genetic drift, and the identification of molecular changes responsible for various human characteristics especially those pertaining to infection, disease, and cognition.\nMolecular study of phylogeny.\nMolecular systematics is the process of using data on the DNA, RNA, or proteins to resolve questions in phylogeny and taxonomy. The idea is to place groups in their correct position on the evolutionary tree. This corrects their biological classification from the point of view of evolution. The technique has already led to major changes in the taxonomy of living things, including the names for higher categories, which had been stable for well over a century.\nMolecular systematics has been made possible by techniques for sequence analysis. This gives the exact sequence of nucleotides or bases in either DNA or RNA. At present it is still expensive to sequence the entire genome of an organism, but it has been done for over 100 species."}

Once a sample has been obtained, DNA sequences may be produced automatically by machine and the result displayed on computer. Interpreting those results is still a task for humans.\nInformation from sequence analysis is used in many fields of biology. It gives information on the relationship between individual organisms, or between groups of organisms. It shows how closely related they are.\nDNA base-pair sequence.\nA DNA sequence is the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. It is written as a succession of letters representing the primary structure of a DNA molecule or strand. If functional, such a sequence carries information for the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule. The possible letters are A, C, G, and T, representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand \u2014 adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine. The sequences are printed next to one another, without gaps, as in the sequence AAAGTCTGAC.\nThe study of RNA and proteins is more complex. The overall structure of DNA is simple and predictable (double helix). The study of RNA and proteins must include a study of their 3-dimensional structure, which is varied, and influences how they work. To some extent this can be assisted by computer, but has to be verified in each case.\nInformation on sequences is kept in databases. Since the development of fast production of gene and protein sequences during the 1990s, the rate of addition of new sequences to the databases increases all the time.\nScore.\nComplete genome analysis has been done on over 800 species and strains. The work is done by a machine, the DNA sequencer, which analyses light signals from fluorochromes attached to the nucleotides. This type of work is gradually becoming less expensive. \nRough totals.\nAs of December 2012, whole genome analysis has been completed on about 800 to 900 living species and strains of species. Numbers are approximate, and changing.\nHuman DNA sequence.\nThe human genome is stored on 23 chromosome pairs in the cell nucleus and in the small mitochondrial DNA. A great deal is now known about the sequences of DNA which are on our chromosomes. What the DNA actually does is now partly known. Applying this knowledge in practice has only just begun.\nThe Human Genome Project (HGP) produced a reference sequence which is used worldwide in biology and medicine. \"Nature\" published the publicly funded project's report, and \"Science\" published Celera's paper. These papers described how the draft sequence was produced, and gave an analysis of the sequence. Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to \u224892% of the sequence.\nThe latest project ENCODE studies the way the genes are controlled.\nForensic work.\nIt is not necessary to have whole genome sequences for forensic work, such as identifying a criminal from traces of DNA left at a crime scene, or for paternity cases. At present whole genome sequencing is still very expensive, but fortunately, simpler and cheaper methods are available.\nThe basic idea is to look at certain loci (places) in the genome which are highly variable between people. About 10 to 15 of these loci are needed for a match, and the legal details differ between countries. A match between a sample and a suspect individual makes it extremely likely that the individual was the source of the sample. This evidence would then be the basis of the prosecution case for a crime. A similar analysis would show that a man was very likely the father of a child. This is really a modern way to do what was done with blood groups before DNA details could be analysed. The methods have been developed mainly by the work of Alec Jeffreys.\nEach person\u2019s DNA contains two alleles of a particular gene or 'marker': one from the father and one from the mother. 'Markers' are genes chosen for having a number of different alleles occurring frequently in the population. The following table is from a commercial DNA paternity testing experiment. It shows how relatedness between parents and child is demonstrated with five markers:\nThe results show that the child and the alleged father\u2019s DNA match for these five markers. The complete test results showed this correlation on 16 markers between the child and the tested man. If a case is tested in court, a forensic scientist would give evidence on the likelihood of getting that result by chance.\nDNA testing in the US.\nThere are state laws on DNA profiling in all 50 states of the United States. Detailed information on database laws in each state can be found at the National Conference of State Legislatures website.\nAncient DNA.\nAncient DNA has been recovered from some sources. The record for survival of DNA suitable for sequence analysis is 700,000 years. A horse skeleton buried in permafrost has provided bones with some DNA surviving. The sequence was only 70% complete, but it was enough for researchers to say \"It would not look like a horse as we know it\u2026 but we would expect it to be a one-toed horse\". For comparison, researchers had access to DNA sequences of modern horses, donkeys and Przewalski's horse."}

It has flat plains, warm to hot climate and a large supply of water for irrigation. This has allowed the Riverina to become one of the most productive and agriculturally varied areas of Australia. With the state of Victoria to the south, and the mountains of the Great Dividing Range to the east, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems.\nThe Riverina has been home to Aboriginal groups for over 40,000 years. It was first settled by Europens in the mid-19th century as a pastoral region growing beef and wool for markets in Australia and overseas. In the 20th century, the building of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as rice and grapes. The Riverina has strong links to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the push behind the federation of Australian colonies.\nThe major cities and towns in the Riverina include Wagga Wagga, Albury and Griffith. Albury and Wagga Wagga are home to campuses of Charles Sturt University. Wagga Wagga is home to two major Australian Defence Force bases.\nGeography.\nThe area of the Riverina region is not fixed, but it usually includes the farming and pastoral areas of New South Wales, west of the Great Dividing Range and in the drainage basin of the snow-fed Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. The north edge of the Riverina is the Lachlan River catchment area known as the Central West. Along the Murray to the south, the Riverina border is the state of Victoria. West of where the Murray and Murrumbidgee meet, is the beginning of the drier Far West region.\nIn general, the Riverina is an alluvial plain formed by soil carried from the Great Dividing Range by streams between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago. The landscape includes rolling hills to the east but then becomes flatter to the west with most of that plain reaching less than above sea level. The western Riverina is mainly flat saltbush plain.\nLandforms and water.\nThe geology of the Riverina has several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina is thought to be the end of the Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone. The eastern part is over the top of the western part of the Lachlan Fold Belt. It is possible that the Riverina has mineral deposits including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the rivers, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the edge of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee flows downstream, the water and soil become more saline.\nThe Riverina is drained by the large Murray-Darling Basin. Rivers and streams in the Riverina generally flow east to west. As well as the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, other streams include Billabong Creek and the Edward River, an anabranch of the Murray. Much of the water carried by these streams is taken out for other uses. In 2001\u20132002, 52% of the Murray and Murrumbidgee water was taken, with 77% of that water used for irrigation."}

It is difficult to measure length, as the worms will stretch, so scientists use weight to estimate the size. The average weight of a fresh adult worm is about 200 grams. They have a dark purple head and a blue-gray body.\nThe worms are found in the Bass River Valley of South Gippsland, near Korumburra and Warragul. They are only found in a small area, of about 100,000 hectares. They live in small pockets of blue-grey clay close to water. They live in burrows about 500mm deep, and can burrow as deep as 1.5m.\nThe habitat the worms used to live in was tall eucalypt forests. Most of this has been cleared for farming, but the worms have continued to survive because they live deep underground. They have been listed a vulnerable species because of these changes. The worms only lay a single egg, between 4-7cm in size. These can take up to one year to hatch, and the worms take several years to become adults, and be able to reproduce. This slow rate of growth, also makes them a vulnerable species."}

He grew up in Baton Rouge and went to school there. Jindal received secondary education at Brown University and Oxford University with concentrations in government and medicine. After graduating from college, Jindal helped several businesses in Louisiana.\nGovernor of Louisiana (2008-16).\nJindal took the oath of office on January 14, 2008 at age 36, becoming the youngest sitting governor in the US and the first Indian-American governor in United States history. Later in his tenure, he was the second youngest governor after fellow Republican Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina. Jindal and Haley are the only Indian-Americans to hold the office of governor in any state in the United States.\nJindal is a conservative Republican who believes in lowering taxes for all classes. As governor, Jindal fought against dishonest politicians. Jindal favors relaxed gun laws and has spoken at the National Rifle Association.\nJindal, traditionally an opponent of excess federal expenditures and activity in states, asked for federal money and manpower after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He was heavily criticized by the White House and others for insisting that the States be responsible for their own affairs. After Hurricane Katrina, he was critical that the Federal government would not do more, faster.\nHe also came under criticism for never asking for more safety inspectors (the Gulf inspectors are a small fraction of the staffing of other regions relative to the number of offshore oil wells.) Jindal also never spoke against the safety record of BP prior to the spill. Defenders of his record argue that he and other Louisiana politicians, made a reasonable tradeoff decision, and Federal resources should be used to assist Louisiana since the oil that is produced benefits the entire country.\nOn January 11, 2016, Jindal left office due to term limits. He was succeeded by John Bel Edwards.\nPersonal life.\nJindal is a Catholic and was baptized during college. He is married to Supriya Jindal, with whom he has three children.\n2016 presidential campaign.\nOn May 18, 2015, Jindal formed a presidential exploratory committee to determine whether he would run as a candidate in the 2016 Presidential election. Jindal announced his candidacy on June 24th, 2015. He was the first Indian - American to run for president. After poor debate performances and polling numbers, Jindal officially suspended his presidential campaign on November 17th, 2015, saying \"this [was] not [his] time\".

They have long, eel-like bodies. Hagfish's eyes are small and not very useful, because the hagfish uses mostly its senses of smell and touch to find food. The whiskers near the hagfish's mouth are called barbels, and are used for touching. They have four hearts, two brains, and no backbone. A fish which looks like the hagfish is the lamprey.\nFeeding.\nHagfish eat invertebrates (animals such as worms) and are also scavengers, eating fish which are dead or dying. Hagfish have four sets of teeth on their tongue to bite pieces of flesh from its prey. They use these tongue teeth to eat. The teeth pinch together to lock onto its food, helping it tear into dead and dying fish which have sunk to the bottom of the sea, where it lives. Often, a hagfish digs into the dead fish that it is eating, removing the insides of the dead fish.\nUsually, people only see hagfish when nets that sweep the sea floor are pulled up. Every fish, even the dead ones at the bottom of the sea, are brought up into the boat by the net. In some of those dead fish, hagfish are found eating. The smelly fish are dumped onto the deck of ships with the hagfish poking out from their bodies.\nSlime.\nWhen hagfish are afraid, they make slime. This slime comes out of the sides of the hagfish's body. They are able to make enough slime to completely fill a two-gallon bucket. The reason such a small fish can make so much slime is because the slime comes out in strings that quickly swell up much bigger when they are in the water.Their unusual way of eating and their slime has made many people call the hagfish the most \"disgusting\" of all sea creatures. Although hagfish are sometimes called \"slime eels,\" they are not eels at all.\nUses of hagfish.\nFood.\nHagfish are usually not eaten by humans in most countries. However, meat from the inshore hagfish (a type of hagfish known as \"kkomjangeo\" (\uaf3c\uc7a5\uc5b4) or \"meokjango\" (\uba39\uc7a5\uc5b4) in Korean and \"Nuta-unagi\" in Japanese) is a popular food in Korea.\nMaterial.\nHagfish skin is used to make leather for wallets and belts. When this leather is sold, it is called \"eel skin\".\nSlime.\nScientists are studying hagfish slime to see if they can use it to make things. The strings of protein in hagfish slime are thin and strong, so they are a useful material. Because it is not made from oil, hagfish slime would be more environmentally friendly than the plastics that we use now."}

The population of crows is limited to crows that exist now or in the future. Probably, geography will be a limitation in practice. To fairly represent the whole population a sample needs to be random. \nPopulation is also used to refer to a set of measurements or values, not only cases actually observed. Suppose, for example, we are interested in the set of all adult crows now alive in the county of Cambridgeshire, and we want to know the mean weight of these birds. For each bird in the population of crows there is a weight, and the set of these weights is called the population of weights."}

He plays the saxophone, violin and trumpet. He is also a composer. He was one of the people that helped make a new jazz style called free jazz, in the 1960s. Coleman's music is also like blues music. His album \"Sound Grammar\" won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music.\nEarly career.\nColeman was born in Fort Worth, Texas. He began playing R&amp;B and bebop music, at first on the tenor saxophone. He wanted to leave his home town so he got a job in 1949 with a traveling show. Then he played with touring R&amp;B shows. In Baton Rouge, he was attacked and his saxophone was destroyed. After that he changed to the alto saxophone, and that is still the instrument he usually plays. He joined a band and traveled with them to Los Angeles, in California. He worked at different jobs while still trying to be successful as a musician.\nFrom the start, Coleman played his music differently to other musicians. Some Los Angeles jazz musicians thought he was playing out of tune. In 1958 Coleman made a record called \"Something Else!!!!: The Music of Ornette Coleman\". Other musicians like Don Cherry, Billy Higgins, Don Payne and Walter Norris also played on the record.\n\"The Shape of Jazz to Come\".\nColeman was very busy in 1959. His made a record called \"Tomorrow Is the Question!\". He played on this ecord with a quartet. He did not play with a piano player. He started working with a record label called Atlantic Records. He made a record called \"The Shape of Jazz to Come\" in 1959. A music critic called Steve Huey said it was a very important jazz record. The album was different from other jazz music.\nColeman's quartet played at a jazz club in New York City. They were popular with other musicians like Leonard Bernstein and Lionel Hampton. Other musicians like Miles Davis did not like his music.\nColeman often played a plastic saxophone. He had first bought a plastic one in Los Angeles in 1954 because he could not afford a metal one. He did not like the sound of the plastic saxophone at first. Now he plays a metal saxophone.\n\"Free Jazz\".\nIn 1960, Coleman made a record called \"\". It was nearly 40 minutes long. It is one of the longest jazz performances on a record. It was an important record in jazz and now there is a jazz style called free jazz.\nDeath.\nColeman died of a cardiac arrest at the age of 85 in New York City on June 11, 2015."}

It was a secondary defence line. It was meant to stop invasion by Nazi forces.\nThe Home Guard existed from 1940 to 1944. It was composed of one and a half million volunteers who were otherwise not allowed to go into military service. The main reason for this was old age. This led to the nickname \"Dad's Army\". The Home Guard guarded the coastal areas of Britain from enemy threats, like paratroopers. They also helped guard some industrial areas, such as factories and airfields. It was widely popularised after the war by the comedy show \"Dad's Army\".\nHistory.\nThe beginning of the Home Guard are usually traced back to Captain Tom Wintringham. When returning from the Spanish Civil War, Wintringham wrote a book called \"How To Reform The Army\". In it, he writes about how Britain could make something similar to the Spanish International Brigades in the Civil War. Although the book was well received, many of its suggestions were ignored at the time. This was because the tensions in Europe did not seem likely to escalate into war. \nFollowing a series of events, Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War at the time, gave a radio broadcast on 19 May 1940. He asked for volunteers to join the Local Defence Volunteers, as it was known in the start. It originally was given jobs that were not related to combat. It worked as a sort of 'armed police force'. However, after complaints from members, the government allowed it to \"delay and obstruct\" the enemy advance. This was putting mostly untrained and unwell people armed with aging weapons against trained troops. Later on in the war, it was renamed the Home Guard, following pressure by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. If the Natzis had crossed the channel the Home Guard wouldn't have stopped the Germans for very long."}

The novel first came out secretly, but the poet George Huddesford revealed that Burney was the writer of \"Evelina\" in what Burney called a \"vile poem\". When it was known that Burney had written \"Evelina\", it immediately made her very famous.\nIn this novel of letters, beautiful Evelina Anville, the heroine, leaves her quiet home for the first time to go to London. Through many dangers and delights of fashionable society, Evelina grows in character and wisdom and finds love with Lord Orville. This sentimental novel of romance and satire was an influence to Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth.\nBackground.\n\"Evelina\" is actually a sequel. Before that was another book that never came out in print. It was the sequel of a finished book titled \"The History of Caroline Evelyn\". On or around her 15th birthday in June, Frances Burney burned all of her writings. Among the works she burned, there was a complete work of fiction, \"The History of Caroline Evelyn\". This was four months before the wedding of Mr. Burney and Mrs. Allen, Burney's new stepmother. It is not clear why she burnt it. However, it is likely that she did it because Mrs. Allen did not like her writing. However, the story of \"Evelina\" was still in her mind, and she began writing it secretly. When she was at the third volume, she felt guilty. She told her father that she was writing a book, but did not explain more, and asked him if she could print it. Dr. Burney laughed and said yes.\n\"Evelina\" came out in January 1778. It was immediately popular. Almost everyone praised the book. Dr. Burney did not know who was the writer until June, when Burney' sister told him. He read it with \"fear &amp; trembling\", but liked it. He later came and praised Frances for writing so well. Burney was so happy she \"threw herself\" into his arms and burst into tears.\nSummary.\nVolume one.\nThe novel begins with a letter from Lady Howard to her friend, the Reverend Arthur Villars. In the letter, Lady Howard says that Madame Duval (the grandmother of Evelina) is going to visit England to see her granddaughter Evelina again. In his reply, Reverend Villars tells her about Evelina's history. 18 years ago, Mme. Duval had been very angry with her daughter Caroline, Evelina's mother, when she ran away with Sir John Belmont. After they had married, Sir John Belmont burnt up the marriage papers, and said that it was the same as if they had never married. Unhappy, she went back to Reverend Villars, who had brought her up, as he now brought up Evelina. There, she gave birth to Evelina, and died. Reverend Villars is afraid that Mme. Duval might make Evelina die shamefully like her mother Caroline.\nReverend Villars wants to keep Evelina away from Mme. Duval, so he lets her visit Lady Howard's home. While she is there, they get news that Lady Howard's son-in-law, Captain Mirvan, is coming back to England. Evelina wants to see what London is like, and asks Reverend Villars to let her go there. Sadly, the Reverend says yes.\nIn London, people are attracted by Evelina's beauty and doubtful birth. Evelina, who is intelligent, but very inexperienced, does not know about the rules of 18th century London society. Because of this, she makes many mistakes. She falls in love with Lord Orville, a handsome, modest, and polite man. Another man, Sir Clement Willoughby, is in love with Evelina, but her birth and his character make him try flirting with her instead of wishing to marry her. Evelina is confused and embarrassed by his behavior, but does not know how to stop him.\nIn London, Evelina is very surprised to meet her grandmother and some of her cousins, the Branghtons. She is embarrassed by their impolite behavior and thinks that Lord Orville will never love her. The Mirvans return to the country, taking Evelina with them.\nBoth Evelina and the Reverend are unhappy to hear Mme Duval's wish to sue Sir John Belmont. Lady Howard writes to Sir John Belmont instead, telling him about Evelina. Evelina waits for the answer fearfully.\nVolume two.\nSir Clermont Willoughby comes to Lady Howard's house without being invited. He and Captain Mirvan dress up like robbers to play a trick on Mme. Duval, whom Captain Mirvan hates. They tell her that M. Du Bois, her friend, is in jail. Afraid, she goes to see if it is true with Evelina. While Captain Mirvan throws Mme. Duval into a ditch and ties her up, Sir Clement Willoughby talks to Evelina privately. Evelina feels very sorry for Mme. Duval, and tries to make Captain Mirvan stop his tricks, but he only becomes angry. Sir Clermont Willoughby offers to go away from Lady Howard's house, and leaves, to Evelina's satisfaction.\nShortly after he leaves, Lady Howard receives a letter from Sir John Belmont. He says that he is already bringing up a daughter of Caroline, and that she will inherit his money. Evelina is very confused, and Mme Duval is furious. She visited Reverend Villars and said she must take Evelina to sue Sir John Belmont. The Reverend says no. Then she threatens that if Evelina does not live with her in London, she will not give Evelina her money when she dies. \"To me, I own, this threat seemed of little consequence (importance),\" writes the Reverend, \"but...my diffidence (fear, shyness, doubt) of the right I have of depriving (taking away) her of so large a fortune...induced me to listen to her proposal\". He tells Evelina to be careful, and \"...not only \"judge\" but...\"act\" for yourself\". Evelina goes with Mme Duval back to London.\nEvelina lives with the Branghton family, and is very unhappy. Mme Duval is very angry to find out that she had been tricked by Captain Mirvan when she finds M. Du Bois at the Branghton's house. At the Branghtons' house, she meets a very poor, melancholy Scottish poet, Mr. Macartney, and sees him with guns in his hands, saying, \"O God!--forgive me!\" Thinking he is trying to kill himself, she stops him and cries, \"O Sir! have mercy upon yourself!\" She later finds out he had been planning to rob people by frightening them with his guns for money, because the Branghtons had threatened to put him in prison if he didn't pay money to stay at their house. He had fallen in love with a lady, but the lady's father had been so angry, they had fought, and the father had become sick. When he told this to his mother, she told him the lady's father was actually his father, who had left them long ago - so the lady he had loved was actually his sister! Evelina gives him her own money, and makes friends with him.\nShe is very sad with the Branghtons, however. Once, they visited Marybone, a pleasure garden. There, Evelina was attacked by a drunken sailor and saved by prostitutes. While she is with the prostitutes, she meets Lord Orville again. She is very surprised when he comes to visit her in the unfashionable part of London and again is kind to her. Later, the Branghtons use Evelina's name to ride in Lord Orville's carriage, even breaking its glass. Horrified, Evelina writes a letter to Lord Orville saying that she was sorry for what the Branghtons did, and the Branghtons had used her name without even telling her. She is shocked when she gets a insulting reply from Lord Orville. \"Oh...how have I been deceived in this man!\" Soon after, she returns to Reverend Villars. There, she becomes very ill. Worried, the Reverend sends her to Bristol Hotwells, a vacation town at Clifton Hill, with her \"extremely clever\" neighbor, Mrs. Selwyn."}

The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust comes 20% from the original formation of the planet, and 80% from the radioactive decay of minerals. The Earth is hottest at its core and, from the core to the surface, the temperature gets gradually cooler.\nResources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles or kilometers beneath the Earth's surface, and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma. It has been used for bathing from Paleolithic times, but is now better known for making electricity.\nAll over the world, geothermal energy was used to make about 10 gigawatts of electricity in the year 2007, about 0.3% of the electricity used around the world. When used to generate electricity, geothermal power plants typically offer constant output.\nGeothermal energy is also used directly for district heating, or in other heating and cooling applications. Buildings in Iceland are heated in this way from the country's many geothermal sites.\nPower plants and thermal applications of geothermal energy are mature technologies, whereas enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) projects are a new type of application.\nAlmost everywhere, the ground 10 feet (3m) below the Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 50\u00b0 and 60\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00b0 and 16\u00a0\u00b0C). Geothermal heat pumps can tap into this resource to heat and cool buildings. A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump, an air delivery system (ductwork), and a heat exchanger - a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building. In the winter, the heat pump uses power to remove heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system. In the summer, the process is reversed, and the heat pump uses power again to move heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger. The heat removed from the indoor air during the summer can also be used to provide a free source of hot water. The power to run the heat pump comes from another source.\nGeothermal energy escapes as hot water at many hot springs or as steam at geysers.\nIn the United States, most geothermal reservoirs of hot water are in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs for the generation of electricity. Some geothermal power plants use the steam from a reservoir to power a turbine / generator, while others use the hot water to boil a working fluid that vaporizes and then turns a turbine. Hot water near the surface of Earth can be used directly for heat. Direct-use applications include heating buildings, growing plants in greenhouses, drying crops, heating water at fish farms, and several industrial processes such as pasteurizing milk.\nHot dry rock resources occur at depths of 3 to 5 miles (5\u20138\u00a0km) everywhere beneath the Earth's surface and at lesser depths in certain areas. Access to these resources involves injecting cold water down one well, circulating it through hot fractured rocks, and drawing off the heated water from another well. Currently, nobody uses this method commercially. Existing technology also does not yet allow recovery of heat directly from magma, the very deep and most powerful resource of geothermal energy. "}

The storm formed in the southern Caribbean Sea on October\u00a09, 1910. It grew stronger as it moved northwest. It then made landfall on the western end of Cuba. The storm made a loop over open water, and then began moving towards the United States. After crossing Florida, the storm moved near the rest of the southeastern United States and passed out to sea.\nBecause of the storm's loop, some reports said it was actually two hurricanes. In Cuba, the storm was one of the worst disasters in the island's history. There was bad damage and thousands of people lost their homes. In Florida, the storm also caused damage and caused flooding in some areas. It is not known exactly how much damage the storm caused. However, losses in Havana, Cuba were over $1\u00a0million. At least 100\u00a0people died in Cuba alone.\nMeteorological history.\nOn October\u00a09, a type of storm called a tropical depression began in the southern Caribbean Sea. It was north of Panama. The storm grew stronger while it moved toward the northwest. It became a tropical storm on October 11. On October 12, it became a hurricane. The next day, the storm was seen to the southwest of Cuba. For a short time, it was a Category\u00a03 hurricane measured on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm then hit western Cuba and crossed the island. It moved over the Gulf of Mexico and slowed down.\nThe hurricane was steered, or moved, by an area of high pressure (a type of weather system) to the north. Over warm water in the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane quickly grew stronger. It then moved in a small circle, and on October\u00a016, it reached its highest power. It had winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). The hurricane turned to the northeast and again hit western Cuba. It began to move near the Florida Panhandle on October\u00a017. The storm hit Cape Romano, and moved to the north. Now over land, the hurricane became weaker. After crossing Florida, it curved to the northeast and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The storm probably died out on October\u00a023.\nThe storm was unusual because it was first thought to be two different hurricanes. This is because of the loop it made in the Gulf of Mexico. One paper reported that the first hurricane died in the central Gulf of Mexico; the second hurricane formed and hit Florida. The storm's path was debated, and it was later found to be a single cyclone.\nImpact.\nOn October\u00a015, all ships in a area around Key West were warned of the storm. Many ships stayed in harbors. Storm warnings were also put up.\nCuba.\nThe storm caused bad damage in Cuba. It was considered one of the worst tropical cyclones on the island. Strong winds and a lot of rain caused flooding in streets, ruined crops (mostly tobacco), and damaged farms. The hurricane affected many towns, including Casilda. The town of Bataban\u00f3 was left under water. The hurricane halted communication to other areas. Most of the deaths and damages were reported to be in the Pinar del R\u00edo Province.\nThe \"New York Times\" wrote that Cuba had \"probably suffered the greatest material disaster in all its history\". Thousands of peasants, or workers, lost their homes. The country's capital, Havana, also suffered bad damage. On the coast, many ships carrying valuable items sunk. The storm also badly damaged goods kept on wharves. Tall waves crashed on land and caused flooding. Many boats were wrecked by the storm. The high waves flooded about of Havana's coastal land.\nAt least 100\u00a0people were killed by the storm, mostly because of mudslides, including five people in Havana. However, some reports say the death toll was as high as 700. Damage caused by the storm cost millions of dollars. In Havana alone, $1 million in losses were reported.\n\"Holliswood\".\nA ship, the \"Holliswood\", became stuck in the storm in the Gulf of Mexico. It left New Orleans on October\u00a01 and was carrying cypress wood. The ship's crew fought the storm for days. The \"Holliswood\" was blown miles off its path. Its owner, Paul Mangold, said:\nA steamboat called the \"Harold\" saw the ship and rescued all of the crew. However, Captain E. E. Walls said he wanted to stay behind. The \"Holliswood\" was badly damaged. The crew told the captain that the ship would be unable to float in five more hours. After the crew was rescued, Captain Walls struggled for days without food or fresh water. On October\u00a020, another ship (the \"Parkwood\") rescued Walls. He was unconscious, and thought to be dead. When he was on the \"Parkwood\", he woke up, but was delirious. He asked to be put back on the \"Holliswood\". Instead, the \"Parkwood\" pulled the damaged ship to land.\nFlorida.\nAt Key West, Florida, winds blew at . Many docks were destroyed. Damage in the Florida Keys was worth around $250,000 (1910\u00a0USD, or $5.7 million in 2009 dollars), and houses near the ocean were damaged. Strong winds pushed water out of the Tampa Bay. High waves from the sea moved over land, and people had to hold onto trees to survive. Some citrus crops were destroyed. The wind tore the roofs off homes and shook buildings off their foundations. \nSeven men died at Punta Gorda when some Cuban ships were wrecked. Near there, one man and a baby drowned, and another died trying to cross a flooded river. A French steamship, the \"Louisiane\", crashed into land. There were 600\u00a0passengers on the ship. All people were rescued by another ship.\nThe hurricane blew down many pine trees near Jupiter, Florida. One man near Lemon City was killed by falling wood. However, the storm's effects on the east coast of Florida were not as bad as they were in other places. Part of the Florida East Coast Railroad was washed out. The storm blew an American ship aground at Boca Raton. Three people died, and the rest of the crew was stuck for 12 hours."}

The other two are the primary sector, which covers areas such as farming, mining and fishing; and the secondary sector which covers manufacturing and making things. The service sector provides services, rather than producing material commodities. Activities in the service sector include retail, banks, hotels, real estate, education, health, social work, computer services, recreation, media, communications, electricity, gas and water supply.\nThe service sector is an important part of the economy. For example, in Australia in 2007, 85% of all businesses were in the service sector. In 2009 there were more than nine million people employed in the service sector in Australia, which was 86% of all jobs. In India, there has been a huge growth in service sector businesses which made up 55% of India's GDP in 2006\u20142007. Computer software businesses in India are increasing at a rate of 35% per year.\nMany sector businesses focus on what is called the \u201cknowledge economy\u201d. They need to keep ahead of other businesses by understanding what their customers want and being ready to give it to them quickly and at low cost. \nOne good example of this are banks which went through big changes in the late 20th century. Using information and communication technology, banks have vastly reduced the number of people they need to employ, and lowered the cost of providing bank service. For example, an automated teller machine is able to provide basic banking services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in many different places. Before this, banking services were only available from the bank when it was open. Many banks and building societies have joined together to form much lower cost businesses that can make more money from a wider customer base. The key to this process is gaining information about their customers and constantly coming up with new services for them. "}

They were both published secretly. \"The Romance of the Forest\" (1791) made her famous as the writer of Gothic romances, the \"hobgoblin romance\", later called \"the Radcliffe romance\". Two novels published when she was alive, \"The Mysteries of Udolpho\" (1794) and \"The Italian\" (1797), helped make her famous as \"the Great Enchantress\". Radcliffe was also a great traveller. She made a book after she traveled to the Continent, \"A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794, through Holland and the Western Frontier of Germany...To Which Are Added Observations of a Tour to the Lakes\" (1795). But the tours written about in the novels were based on travel books, landscape paintings, and imagination.

The mud is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable. Shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness, called \"fissility\" (= ~splitting). Mudstones, on the other hand, are similar in composition but do not show the fissility.\nShales and mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks. However, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale. Black shales form in anoxic (without oxygen) conditions. They contain free carbon and iron sulfides such as pyrite. This produces the black colouration.\nFormation of shale.\nShales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoonal deposits, in river deltas, on floodplains and offshore from beach sands. They can also be deposited on the continental shelf, in relatively deep, quiet water. This process could have taken millions of years to complete.\n'Black shales' are dark, as a result of being especially rich in unoxidized carbon. Black shales are deposited in anoxic or low oxygen environments, such as in stagnant water columns. They are common in some Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata, Some black shales contain abundant heavy metals such as molybdenum, uranium, vanadium, and zinc.

Organic foods are unique to the way other products are produced as chemically treated food can cause a lot of harm to the environment by decreasing the quality of soil and increasing energy use, carbon emissions, pesticides and nitrate pollution. Also the used chemicals can cause severe damage to human cells and long term consumption can cause diseases like colon cancer (colorectal cancer), decrease fertility and take impact on the brain development of unborn children.\nOrganic farming maintains the soil health the cropping system of organic farming keeps insect, pest and weeds under check. Even farm waste are recycled in organic farming and it prevents the pollution of any component of our environment.\nForms Of Organic Farming.\nOrganic farming finds usage for animal welfare, as livestock is bred with solely organic fodder. There are animal farms that are exclusively built for organic farming and are only distributing organic meat. In recent past many of those regional farms are using online shops for distribution like \"Das Gute Fleisch\" (which means \"the good meat\") from germany. Therefore a wider audience has comfortable access to organic meat whereas the demand for organic meat is rapidly growing.\nFlower growers and ordinary home gardens can use organic methods too. An example of organic farming which is often used in the garden is biological control. Biological control means using natural methods to get rid of pests, instead of using poisons. For example by encouraging Ladybirds (ladybugs) into the garden as they eat aphids (greenfly).\nOrganic Labels.\nThere are certain organisations per country wich regulate the standards for organic farming. In the USA e.g. the USDA is distributing official \"USDA Organic Labels\" for products that fullfill the criterias of the organisation to accept them as organic food.\nOther than the US versions wich differ in a \"100 % organic label\" and labels that state that the products are not fully organic, there is only one organic label for the EU that covers similar criterias as the \"100 % label\". Therefore it's harder to get organic farming certified in the EU.\nThere are also non-official labels by private companies that are rating products or using similar criterias to categorise the organic farms. They commonly have a high reputation so customers can rely on their rating."}

Eventually the bronchioles end in the alveoli (small air sacs). At the alveoli, oxygen from the air we breathe into our lungs is moved into the blood. The blood then carries oxygen around to the rest of the body, which needs oxygen to survive. Without the bronchi, air would never get into the lungs, and oxygen would never get into our bodies.\nThe bronchi's walls are made of cartilage. \nThe right bronchus (shown on the left in the image on this page) is shorter, wider, and straighter than the left bronchus."}

He is a former head of the Weather Underground. Ayers is known for speaking out against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. He is also known for his current work in trying to help make learning and teaching better. In 1969, Ayers started the Weather Underground. The Weather Underground is a group that call themselves a \"communist revolutionary group\". They carried out bombings against public buildings during the 1960s and 1970s. This was because the United States was being a part of the Vietnam War. Ayers is a professor in the College of Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He has the titles of Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar. During the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, a controversy was brought up over ties between Ayers and then Senator Barack Obama. Ayers is married to Bernadine Dohrn. She was also a member of the Weather Underground.\nEarly life.\nBill Ayers grew up in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. Glen Ellyn is just outside Chicago. He went to public schools there until his second year of high school. After this he started going to Lake Forest Academy. It is a smaller prep school. Ayers received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in American studies in 1968. He is the son of Thomas G. Ayers. His father used to be Chairman and CEO of Commonwealth Edison.\nIn 1965, Ayers was part of a group who were protesting at a restaurant in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The restaurant would not serve African Americans. Ayers' first arrest came when he took part in a sit-in at a local draft board. He sat in jail for ten days. Shortly after his arrest, he landed his first teaching job at the Children's Community School. This small preschool was run from a local church basement. The preschool was part of a larger movement across the United States called the \"free school movement\". Schools that were part of this movement had no grades or report cards. Instead, they tried to work on getting students to cooperate with each other and work together instead of competing. The teachers allowed the students to call them by their first names. After teaching for only a few months, at the age of 21, Ayers became the head of the school. There he also met Diana Oughton, who would be his girlfriend until her death in an explosion in 1970.\nBeginnings with the Weathermen.\nAyers became part of the New Left and the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in the early 1960s. In 1968 and 1969, Ayers became well known as a head of the SDS. He was head of a smaller SDS group called the \"Jesse James Gang\". Ayers made important changes to Weatherman beliefs about being militant (ready to fight for the cause). The group that Ayers headed in Detroit, Michigan became one of the first groups that would turn into the Weathermen. Before the June 1969 SDS convention, Ayers became an important head of the group. This came about due to a split in the group.\nIn June 1969, the Weathermen took over the SDS at its convention. Ayers was made Education Secretary. Later in 1969, Ayers helped to place a bomb at a statue that was made to honor policemen that were killed. The bomb blast broke almost 100 windows and blew parts of the statue onto a nearby street. (The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4, 1970, and blown up again by other Weathermen on October 6, 1970. While they were putting it back together, the city put a 24-hour guard around it to stop another attack. In January 1972, it was moved to Chicago Police headquarters. Ayers was also part of the \"Days of Rage\" riot that took place in Chicago in 1969. He was also a part of the \"War Council\" meeting that happened in Flint, Michigan. Two big decisions came from the \"War Council\". The first was to start a violent, armed resistance (using bombs, and robberies) against the government. The second was to start underground (secret) groups in important cities around the country. An FBI informant named Larry Grathwohl, who pretended to be a Weatherman in 1969, said that \"Ayers, along with Bernardine Dohrn, probably had the most authority within the Weatherman\".\nYears underground.\nIn 1970, Weatherman members Ted Gold, Terry Robbins, and Diana Oughton were killed when a bomb they were building blew up. This was called the Greenwich Village town house explosion. Ayers and several other Weathermen were able to avoid being caught following this explosion. Ayers was not facing charges at this time, but the federal government later brought charges against him. Ayers was part of the bombings of New York City Police Department headquarters in 1970, the United States Capitol building in 1971, and the Pentagon in 1972. Ayers wrote, in 2001, that: Although the bomb that rocked the Pentagon was itsy-bitsy - weighing close to two pounds - it caused 'tens of thousands of dollars' of damage. The operation cost under $500, and no one was killed or even hurt. \nSome new reports have said that Ayers, Dohrn, or the Weatherman took part in the 1970 San Francisco Police Department bombing. However, neither Ayers, nor anyone else has ever been charged with this crime.\nIn 1973, it was discovered that the FBI were focusing on the Weatherman as well as the New Left. This was part of several secret, and sometimes illegal FBI projects called COINTEL. Because the FBI agents had broken the law, the government asked that all weapons and bomb charges be dropped against the Weather Underground. This included charges against Ayers.\nHowever, there were still state charges against Dohrn. Dohrn did not want to turn herself in to the police. \"He was sweet and patient, as he always is, to let me come to my senses on my own\", she later said of Ayers. She finally turned herself in, in 1980. She was fined $1,500 and given three years probation.\nIn 1973 Ayers helped write the book \"Prairie Fire\" with others who were part of the Weather Underground. They dedicated the book to almost 200 people, including Harriet Tubman, John Brown, 'All Who Continue to Fight', 'All Political Prisoners in the U.S.', and Sirhan Sirhan, who was convicted of killing Robert F. Kennedy.\nLooking back on the underground period.\n\"Fugitive Days: A Memoir\".\nIn 2001, Ayers wrote \"Fugitive Days: A Memoir\". He said \"Fugitive Days\" tried to answer the questions of Kathy Boudin's son and his statement that Diana Oughton died trying to stop the Greenwich Village bomb makers. Some have questioned the truth, accuracy, and tone of the book. Brent Staples wrote for \"The New York Times Book Review\" that \"Ayers reminds us often that he can't tell everything without endangering people involved in the story. Historian Jesse Lemisch (who was also a member of the SDS) said that Ayers' memories were wrong. Ayers, in the beginning of his book, says that it was written as his personal memories and was not a research project.\nStatements made in 2001.\n\"Chicago Magazine\" said that \"just before the September 11 attacks\", Richard Elrond, who was hurt in the \"Days of Rage\", was given an apology from Ayers and Dohrn. \"[T]hey were remorseful,\" Elrod says. \"They said, 'We're sorry that things turned out this way.'\" Ayers gave a lot of interviews before his book was published. In these interviews he defended his history of radical words and actions. Some of the articles were written before the September 11 attacks and appeared right after. Many comments were made by the media comparing the statements that Ayers was making about his past just as a terrorist incident shocked the public.\nA lot of the controversy about Ayers in the years since 2000 comes from an interview that he gave to \"The New York Times\". The reporter quoted him as saying \"I don't regret setting bombs\" and \"I feel we didn't do enough\". When asked if he would \"do it all again,\" he said \"I don't want to discount the possibility.\" Ayers questioned the interviewer's way of describing him in a \"Letter to the Editor\" on September 15 2001. In his letter, Ayers wrote: \"This is not a question of being misunderstood or 'taken out of context', but of deliberate distortion.\" In the following years, Ayers has said that what he meant by saying that he had \"no regrets\" and \"we didn't do enough\" he was talking about their efforts to stop the US from fighting in the Vietnam War. He said these efforts were \". . . inadequate [as] the war dragged on for a decade.\" Ayers has repeatedly said that the two statements did not mean that he wished they had set more bombs.\nViews since 2001.\nAyers was asked in a 2004 interview, \"How do you feel about what you did? Would you do it again under similar circumstances?\" He said: \"I've thought about this a lot. Being almost 60, it's impossible to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things, but the question of did we do something that was horrendous, awful? ... I don't think so. I think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable.\" On September 9, 2008, journalist Jake Tapper talked about the comic strip in Ayers' blog, where he explained the soundbite: \"The one thing I don't regret is opposing the war in Vietnam with every ounce of my being... When I say, 'We didn't do enough,' a lot of people rush to think, 'That must mean, \"We didn't bomb enough shit.\"' But that's not the point at all. It's not a tactical statement, it's an obvious political and ethical statement. In this context, 'we' means 'everyone.'\"\nIn 2008, Ayers said this about his actions:\nThe Weather Underground crossed lines of legality, of propriety and perhaps even of common sense. Our effectiveness can be \u2014 and still is being \u2014 debated.\nHe also again defended his actions against charges of terrorism:\nThe Weather Underground went on to take responsibility for placing several small bombs in empty offices... We did carry out symbolic acts of extreme vandalism directed at monuments to war and racism, and the attacks on property, never on people, were meant to respect human life and convey outrage and determination to end the Vietnam war.\nPolitical views.\nIn an interview that Ayers gave in 1995, he said of his political beliefs in the 1960s and 1970s: \"I am a radical, Leftist, small 'c' communist ... [Laughs] Maybe I'm the last communist who is willing to admit it. [Laughs] We have always been small 'c' communists in the sense that we were never in the Communist party and never Stalinists. The ethics of communism still appeal to me. I don't like Lenin as much as the early Marx. I also like Henry David Thoreau, Mother Jones and Jane Addams [...]\" In 1970 Ayers was called \"a national leader\" of the Weatherman organization and \"one of the chief theoreticians of the Weathermen\" by \"The New York Times\".\nThe Weatherman started off as part of the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) within the SDS. They split from the RYM's Maoists saying they had no time to build another party. They also said that war against the United States government and capitalism should begin right away. Their founding paper called for the creation of a \"white fighting force\" to fight with the \"Black Liberation Movement\" and other \"anti-colonial' movements. to achieve \"the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism.\" In June 1974, the Underground released their 151-page work called \"Prairie Fire\". \"Prairie Fire\" said that: \"We are a guerrilla organization [...] We are communist women and men underground in the United States [...]\" The Weatherman's leaders, including Ayers, wanted radical changes to sexual relations and used the slogan \"Smash Monogamy\".\nClaims by Grathwohl.\nLarry Grathwohl, who was an FBI agent who joined the Underground, said that Ayers wanted to overthrow the United States government. In an interview that he gave in January 2009, Grathwohl said that:\n\"The thing the most bone chilling thing Bill Ayers said to me was that after the revolution succeeded and the government was overthrown, they believed they would have to eliminate 25 million Americans who would not conform to the new order.\" \nAyers replied:\n\"Never said it. Never thought it. And again, Larry Grathwohl, I don't know him today, but certainly the FBI was an organization built on lies.\"\nIn an interview with ABC7 reporter Alan Wang, Ayers said that \"Now that's being blown into dishonest narratives about hurting people, killing people, planning to kill people. That's just not true. We destroyed government property,\" said Ayers. However, when asked if he ever made bombs, Ayers replied: \"I'm just not going to talk about it.\"\nRelationship with President Obama.\nDuring the 2008 U.S. presidential election, a controversy started about Ayers' contact with then-Senator Barack Obama. This had been well known in Chicago for years. After being raised by the British press The ties between Ayers and Obama was written about by blogs and newspapers in the United States. The issue was also talked about in a debate by moderator George Stephanopoulos. It later became an issue for John McCain's campaign. \"The New York Times\", CNN, and several other news groups said that Obama does not have a close friendship with Ayers. After the election, Ayers said he did not have any close ties with Obama and condemned the Republicans for using \"guilt by association\" tactics. In a new afterword to his book, he added a note saying that he knew the Obamas \"as neighbors and family friends.\" But in an interview with \"Good Morning America\", Ayers said the afterword was \"describing there how the blogosphere characterized the relationship.\"\nAcademic career.\nAyers teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He mainly focuses on social justice, fixing education in urban areas, children who are in trouble with the law and related issues.\nHe began working as a teacher at the Children's Community School (CCS). CCS was started by a group of students and based on the Summerhill way of teaching. After he left the underground, he earned an Masters in Education (M.Ed) from Bank Street College in Early Childhood Education (1983)), an M.Ed from Teachers College, Columbia University in Early Childhood Education (1987) and an Ed. D from Teachers College, Columbia University in Curriculum and Instruction (1987).\nHe has edited and written many books and articles. They usually have to deal with education. He has also been on many panels and symposia.\nPersonal life.\nAyers is married to Bernardine Dohrn. Dohrn was also part of the Weather Underground. They have two adult children and they share custody of Chesa Boudin. Boudin is the son of two former Underground members who were put in jail. Chesa Boudin went on to win a Rhodes Scholarship. Ayers and Dohrn live in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago.\nIn 1997 Chicago awarded him its Citizen of the Year award for his work on the Chicago Annenberg Challenge project."}

It is commonly called brittle bone disease. It is usually an autosomal dominant disease, which means a person can get it if only one of their parents has the abnormal gene. OI affects the part of the bones called the collagen rod, which provides bone strength. The abnormal gene weakens or even destroys the collagen rod. This disease was first identified by Vrolik in 1849.\nWhen someone has this disease, their bones are more likely to break. Unfortunately, osteogenesis imperfecta has no cure. This disease is categorized in four types: Type one is the most common case and it often causes brittle teeth and bone related injuries. Type two is a more severe version of type one and has most of the same symptoms just in more severe cases. People with type three of osteogenesis imperfecta may have more than 100 fractures before puberty. Their eyes often develop a purple, blue, or grey tint and people with this case also often have hearing loss. 50% of people that have osteogenesis imperfecta have hearing loss while becoming an adult. Type 4 is a more severe case of most symptoms stated above.\nSymptoms.\nLess severe symptoms of OI may include:\nOI has many other serious and fatal symptoms including respiratory problems and bone deformity.\nDemographics.\nOI occurs equally in both male and females and can affect all ethnic groups. OI happens in the womb and there is no cure. It is usually discovered when someone breaks a lot of bones; they may have DNA testing to check for OI. It occurs in 1 in 20,000 births."}

It has been home to the Yellow Jackets football team since 1905. It is also the oldest stadium in Division I Football Bowl Subdivision.\nBobby Dodd Stadium is named in honor of Robert Lee \"Bobby\" Dodd, longtime football coach and athletic director at Georgia Tech. The field is named for Hugh Inman Grant, son of John W. Grant, an Atlanta merchant. \nLocation.\nThe stadium is located on the east side of the Georgia Tech campus. It is in the middle of Atlanta, just off Interstate 75/Interstate 85, across from the Varsity restaurant.\nHistory.\nIt was first known as Grant Field (it was renamed Bobby Dodd Stadium in 1988). The stadium is the oldest continuously used on-campus site for college football in the southern United States.\nFootball has been played at the current site since 1905. In 1913, grandstands were built for the first time, mostly by Tech students. \nThe stadium does not look like it originally did. It has been expanded several times. The original stadium seated 5,600. By 1925, the west and south stands were completed, making the stadium a 30,000-seat horseshoe with an open north end. The west stands were rebuilt and a large press box was added in 1947, bringing capacity up to 44,000. The original all-steel 4,105-seat North stands were built in 1958. In 1962 and 1968 the upper decks were added to the East and West sides bringing capacity to its all-time high of 58,121. In 1985 the South stands were taken down to make room for the William C. Wardlaw Center. \nThe west grandstand now covers the old one, which is still underneath it. Grant Field was occasionally used as a site for Atlanta Falcons games during the team's early years when it was sharing Fulton County Stadium with the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball. If the Falcons needed to play a game at the same time as the Braves, they would play at Grant Field. The lighting was replaced in 1998. \nFollowing the 2001 season, a major expansion and renovation project was started, which was done in two phases in order to play the 2002 season in the stadium. For the 2002 season, seating was returned to the South end in front of the Wardlaw Center, and the original North stands and lower east bleachers were rebuilt and bowled in. After the 2002 season, the expansion was completed by adding a free standing upper deck in the north end zone. This addition of a north end zone upper deck brought Bobby Dodd Stadium to its current capacity. The new stadium was rededicated during the 2003 home season opener versus the Auburn Tigers on September 2, 2003.\nIn the summer of 2009, Bobby Dodd Stadium underwent a number of changes. First, the scoreboard was renovated and after completion, is now twice as big as the old scoreboard. Also, ribbon boards were installed in front of the Wardlaw Center, as well as along the sides of the stadium. Another change was the improvement of the sound system in the stadium. "}

He was born in Leningrad, USSR (Saint Petersburg). In 1976 he defected to the Netherlands. He lived in Switzerland for many years, and became a Swiss citizen. Towards the end of his life, he was the oldest active grandmaster on the regular tournament circuit. Viktor was at or near the top in chess for half a century.\nIn all, Korchnoi was a candidate for the World Championship on ten occasions (1962, 1968, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1988 and 1991). Korchnoi was also a four-time USSR chess champion, a five-time member of Soviet teams that won the European championship, and a six-time member of Soviet teams that won the Chess Olympiad.\nMatches against Karpov.\nKorchnoi played three matches against Anatoly Karpov, the latter two for the World Chess Championship. In 1974, he lost the Candidates final to Karpov by the narrowest margin: 11.5\u201312.5. Karpov was declared world champion in 1975 when Bobby Fischer failed to defend his title. Then, after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1976, Korchnoi won two Candidates cycles to qualify for World Championship matches with Karpov in 1978 and 1981.\n1978 match.\nThe 1978 Karpov\u2013Korchnoi World Championship match was held in Baguio, Philippines. It was one of those events where the struggle took place off as well as on the board. Korchnoi's status as a defector and stateless person was exploited to the full by the Soviet delegation. Karpov's team was a dozen strong, and only three of them were chess players. They included Dr Zukhar, Karpov's personal psychiatrist/psychologist, whom (it was claimed) attempted to hypnotise Korchnoi during play.\nThere was constant controversy off the board, with X-raying of chairs, protests about the flags used on the board, hypnotism complaints and the mirror glasses used by Korchnoi. When Karpov's team sent him a blueberry yogurt during a game without any request for one by Karpov, the Korchnoi team protested, claiming it could be some kind of code. They later said this was intended as a parody of earlier protests, but it was taken seriously at the time. The story of these off-the-board struggles has been reported in detail, from the Korchnoi point of view.\nAs a sporting contest, it had an exciting climax. The match would go to the first player to win six games, draws not counting. After 17 games, Karpov had an imposing 4\u20131 lead. Korchnoi won game 21, but Karpov won game 27, putting him on the brink of victory with a 5\u20132 lead. Korchnoi fought back, scoring three wins and one draw in the next four games, to equalise the match at 5\u20135 after 31 games. However, Karpov won the next game, and the match, by 6\u20135 with 21 draws. For the second time, Karpov had won by the narrowest possible margin.\n1981 match.\nKorchnoi won the next Candidates' cycle to again earn the right to challenge Karpov in 1981. The match, held in Merano, Italy, was held in an atmosphere of political tension. Korchnoi's wife and son were still in the Soviet Union. His son was promised that he would be allowed to join his father, if he gave up his passport. When he did so, he was promptly drafted into the Soviet army. In spite of protests, Korchnoi's son was arrested for evading army service, sentenced to two and a half years in labour camp, and served the full sentence. After the release, he was again refused permission to leave the USSR. In 1982, six years after Korchnoi's defection, his son finally succeeded in leaving the country.\nIn what was dubbed the 'Massacre in Merano', Karpov defeated Korchnoi convincingly by 6 wins to 2, with ten draws.\nLater career.\n1984 Korchnoi\u2013Kasparov match.\nKorchnoi was due to play the young Soviet Garry Kasparov in the next (1984) Candidates' cycle. He seemed to have great fondness for Garry Kasparov \u2013 possibly because he recognized the situation Kasparov was in \u2013 a prominent talent blocked by the Soviet bureaucracy.\nThe match was to be held in Pasadena, California, but the Soviet Chess Federation protested. Possibly this was because Korchnoi was a defector and the match was in the cold-war enemy's backyard, and because of the soon-to-be-announced Soviet decision to boycott the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles). At any rate, Kasparov was not allowed to fly there to play the match. This defaulted the match to Korchnoi.\nHowever, after a remarkable series of events, spearheaded by the British Grandmaster Raymond Keene, Korchnoi agreed to play the match in London. This was a gracious gesture by Korchnoi, since technically he had already won by default. After a good start, Korchnoi was overcome by Kasparov's attacking play and remarkable maturity.\nLater life.\nViktor continued to play in Europe, living in his adopted country of Switzerland. He represented their Olympiad team on top board. Korchnoi first played for Switzerland at the 1978 Olympiad, held in Buenos Aires, where he took the individual gold medal for best performance on board one.\nOn the January 2007 FIDE rating list, Korchnoi was ranked number 85 in the world at age 75, by far the oldest player ever to be ranked in the FIDE top 100. The second-oldest player on the January 2007 list was Alexander Beliavsky, 22 years younger than Korchnoi.\nIn September 2006, Korchnoi won the 16th World Senior Chess Championship, held in Italy, with a 9\u20132 score. Korchnoi scored 7.5\u20130.5 in his first eight games, then drew his last three games. This is the first world title Korchnoi had won. Viktor achieved another mark by winning the 2009 Swiss championship in Gr\u00e4chen. He scored 7/9 at the open tournament.\nViktor's style of play was total commitment. He almost always played for a win if at all possible, and rarely took short draws. He was often seen in complex, double-edged positions, where it is difficult to see what is going on.\nDeath.\nKorchnoi died at the age of 85 in Wohlen, Switzerland from complications of a stroke on 6 June 2016."}

The time of Greek history from about 1600 BC to about 1100 BC is called Mycenaean Greece.\nPeople.\nThe Mycenaeans of Greece had learned many things from other lands. By 1400 B.C., they were known for their art, literature, and philosophy. Their most important city, Mycenae (mi see' n\u00e9e), was just north of what later became Corinth.\nIn 1300 BC the king built a wall 23 ft wide and 60 ft high. The stone blocks used were very big. A \"corbel arch\", where each stone hung a little further beyond the one below, was used. A triangle was also used to support it. The Lion Gate, the main gate of the wall and an example of a corbel arch, is still admired today.\nThe common people went inside the palace walls in times of danger but at other times lived in their own houses. Their houses were shaped like deep rectangles with flat roofs and front porches. People worked at many different jobs. They were cooks, doctors, carpenters, tailors, woodcutters, and makers of textiles. The Mycenaeans grew many things and kept animals like oxen, sheep, pigs, and goats. They also built good roads and bridges. Their army was strong. Spears and have been found, and also many swords, big and small. Their edge and point were used.\nDecline and collapse.\nBy 1200 BC the power of Mycenae was declining. The eventual destruction of Mycenae was part of the general Bronze Age collapse in the Greek mainland and beyond. Within a short period all the palaces of southern Greece were burnt, including that at Mycenae. The cause or causes of the Bronze Age collapse are not known for sure.\nReligion.\nFor their worship of gods, these people made shrines. Poseidon was worshiped as a chief deity, and the \u201cprotector of the sky\u201d was Zeus. They also worshipped Apollo, Artemis, Hera and many others of the Greek religion. "}

He broke the previous record held by Vladimir Kramnik.\nIn London, March 2013, Carlsen won the 2013 Candidates tournament and qualified to challenge Anand for the World Chess Championship.\nSponsorship.\nWhen Carlsen became the fourth best player in the world he reached an agreement with a public relations (PR) expert in early 2009. This arrangement has borne fruit. Carlsen now has two sponsors, each of which provides 100,000 Euros a year. One is a stockbroker, the other a law firm. With this money, Carlsen is able to travel, and spend time on training. His coach is Garry Kasparov, a former World chess champion.\nIn return for the sponsorship, Carlsen wears the names of the sponsors on his jackets. This is called 'logo exposure'. He attends meetings, and gives talks. His image helps the companies to hire 'high achievers' to their staff. Put simply, companies of that type are keen to hire intelligent people. Carlsen's overall business manager is his father, Henrik.\nNorway held the 2014 Chess Olympiad, and the Norwegian Government has pledged (promised) 70 million kroner (~8.5 million euros) in support of the event."}

A good fisherman can cast the lure into places where the fish hide, like under logs.\nThere are many types of fishing lures. Most of them are made to look like dying, injured, or fast fish. They can be made of wood, plastic, rubber, metal, cork, feathers, animal hair, and other things. Some are shiny so that they catch the fish's attention.\nFishing lures can come in many different types such as a jig or a popper. A jig will usually have a weight attached to it so it can float at the right height. A popper is a lure used to attract trout and bass. A popper has a colorful design in the front to attract fish. Fishing lures can be very expensive as some are sold for thousands of dollars. \nThe fishing lure was invented in 1890 by a man named James Heddon. He created the fishing lure by accident by taking a big piece of wood and carving a frog shape into it and taking the lure and attaching it to his line. Then he threw it in the water and immediately caught a bass. The next day he started a company called the Heddon Company and the era of the fishing lure was born. "}

They are nocturnal omnivores that do not need to drink water. They get their moisture from food, which includes insects and their larvae, seeds, spiders, bulbs, fruit, fungi, and very small animals.

The Super Bowl was held there in 2008 and 2015, and it will be held there again in 2023. Several college football games, including the annual Fiesta Bowl, have been played there, as have some high school games. It has also hosted several significant soccer (association football) matches, including several matches in the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup and Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in 2016.

But sometimes, it has a metallic taste. Because carbon dioxide is made faster by baking powder than yeast, breads made with it are called quick breads.\nMost baking powders are made up of an alkaline (usually baking soda), one or two acid salts, and a starch (cornstarch or sometimes potato starch). Baking soda is where the carbon dioxide comes from, and the acid releases it, like this:\nBird was quickly followed by Henry Jones (1812 \u2013 12 July 1891) who invented self-rising flour in 1845."}

The Haber process uses a catalyst mostly made up of iron.\nHistory.\nThe Haber process is named after the German scientist . Haber was the first person to successfully complete the process. In 1909, Haber's process could produce about one cup of ammonia every two hours. Carl Bosch helped to develop the Haber process for industry. In 1913, the German company BASF started using the Haber process to make ammonia. During World War I, the Haber process was used to make explosives. The Germans kept this a secret until after the war. In 1918, Haber won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and in 1931, Bosch also shared a Nobel Prize.\nThe Haber process is still important today because it produces ammonia, which is needed for fertilizer and for many other purposes. The Haber process produces about 500 million tons (453 billion kilograms) of fertilizer every year. This fertilizer helps to feed about 40% of the world's population.\nThe process.\nThe gases for the Haber process must be prepared before changing them into ammonia. After that is done, ammonia is created by using magnetite (iron oxide) as the catalyst:\nIn this process, only about 15% of the nitrogen and hydrogen is changed into ammonia. However, the unused nitrogen and hydrogen is recycled. Overall, 98% of nitrogen and hydrogen can be changed into ammonia."}

It was part of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The waters where it formed were thought to be too cold for tropical cyclones to exist. Vince was the 20th named storm and 12th hurricane of the season.\nThe storm that became Vince started out as an extratropical cyclone. It became a subtropical storm on October\u00a08 to the southeast of the Azores. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially give the storm a name until the next day. Vince grew into a hurricane before beginning to weaken at sea. On October\u00a011, it made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula in Spain. At that time, it was a tropical depression. It may have been the first storm to hit the area since a hurricane in 1842. Vince died out over Spain. However, it did drop rain on the country. What was left of the storm passed into the Mediterranean Sea. Vince was one of only three storms to do so, alongside the 1842 Spanish hurricane and Subtropical Storm Alpha of 2020.\nMeteorological history.\nOn October 5, a storm now known as the 2005 Azores subtropical storm was absorbed by another low pressure area. It then began to develop and become more organized. It became a subtropical cyclone early on October\u00a08. The storm was 580\u00a0miles (930\u00a0km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not name the system Vince at the time, because the waters here were thought to be too cold for tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist. The storm slowly became more tropical, with a warm center. It became a tropical storm the next day in water cooler than 24\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u00a0\u00b0F), colder than the 26.5\u00a0\u00b0C (80\u00a0\u00b0F) usually needed for tropical storms.\nAfter becoming a tropical storm, it had an eye, a clear opening at the center of the storm. The NHC named it Tropical Storm Vince, but at the time, it was not known whether Vince was tropical or subtropical. A later analysis of the storm found that Vince became tropical before it was given a name. The storm's eye became more settled and had a diameter of 15\u00a0mi (25\u00a0km). The storm also became stronger; it reached its highest force on October 9. At the time, it had wind speeds of 75 mph (120\u00a0km/h), a very weak Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. One NHC weather forecaster said that \"if it looks like a hurricane, it probably is, despite its environment and unusual location\".\nHurricane Vince quickly began to weaken because wind shear began to erode it. Vince weakened to a tropical storm. A type of weather system called a trough moved towards Vince from the northwest It pulled thunderstorms related to Vince away from the storm, and its center quickly moved to the east. On October\u00a010, two short bursts of thunderstorms surprised forecasters. However, because the water was so cold, the storm kept weakening. Vince became weaker as it came closer to the Iberian Peninsula. It became a tropical depression on October\u00a011. This was just before it made its landfall in Huelva, Spain. The fast-moving tropical depression quickly died out over land. What was left of the cyclone moved across southern Spain. It moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante early on October\u00a012.\nPreparations and impact.\nThe Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination declared a rain pre-emergency for the province of Castell\u00f3n. They were afraid that Hurricane Vince would bring rains which would flood the area. The Instituto Nacional de Meteorolog\u00eda (INM) issued a bulletin. It warned of a 40% chance of flooding. Four autonomous regions (Asturias, Catalu\u00f1a, Castile and Le\u00f3n and Galicia) issued flood warnings. Canarias issued a wind warning. Fishing fleets from Spain off the Andalusian coast went back to port. They were hit by the storm while anchored. The storm did not hit them in the open ocean.\nSpain had been fighting a record drought that year. They welcomed the rains brought by Vince's remnants. In two days the storm brought a lot of rain to the province of A Coru\u00f1a. This eased the sinking water levels in the reservoirs. But this also caused bad traffic and small floods. In Cordoba province, the A-303, A-306 and OC-293 roads were slightly flooded. The entrance of the University of A Coru\u00f1a was blocked for some time. It was blocked by flood waters on October\u00a011. A nearby roundabout was submerged. There were limited damages. No one died in the storm. The highest winds reported on land were 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h). These winds were reported at Jerez, Spain. \nSome ships reported stronger winds. The rainfall as a result of the hurricane was like normal rains from temperate systems. Only one to two\u00a0inches (25 to 50\u00a0mm) of rain fell. Using the words of a song in the movie \"My Fair Lady\", National Hurricane Center forecaster James Franklin in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Vince wrote, \"the rain in Spain was mainly less than 2\u00a0inches, although 3.30\u00a0inches (84\u00a0mm) fell in the plain at Cordoba.\"\nRecords and naming.\nHurricane Vince began in an odd place, an area where tropical cyclones do not usually originate from. However, it does not hold any important records. Tropical Storm Alberto of the 1988 season formed farther north than any other storm, at 41.5\u00b0\u00a0N. Also, Hurricane Ginger of the 1967 season formed at 18.1\u00b0\u00a0W, the farthest east of any tropical cyclones. Hurricane Vince became a \"hurricane\" further east than any known storm, at 18.9\u00b0\u00a0W, prior to 2019\u2019s Hurricane Pablo, at 18.8\u00b0W. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when wind speeds grow higher than .\nThe National Hurricane Center said that Vince was the first tropical cyclone known to hit the Iberian Peninsula. However, some documents claim that the 1842 Spain hurricane struck the Iberian Peninsula on October\u00a029, 1842. That hurricane may have been stronger. More recently, Tropical Storm Grace formed farther north than Vince.\nWhen Subtropical Storm Vince began on October\u00a08, it was earliest in a season that the twenty-first tropical or subtropical storm formed. It was 38\u00a0days ahead of the record before that, which was set by Tropical Storm\u00a021 of the 1933 season. Because Vince did not cause bad damage, the World Meteorological Organization did not retire (stop using) the name \"Vince\". It will be on the list of names for the 2011 season."}

The Mannerist style of painting or sculpture often shows figures that are \"elongated\" (made longer) and \"distorted\" (made into strange shapes\"). The aim of the Mannerist artist was usually to make art that looked \"elegant\".\nThe Mannerist style began in Italy, where the artists were influenced by the figures that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling and in the \"Last Judgement\" in the Sistine Chapel. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael had tried very hard to learn from nature, and to paint things in a way that was very realistic. These two famous painters both died around 1520. Many artists then decided that they were going to use the art of painting to \"express themselves\". They were not going to follow the rules of anatomy and perspective in the way that Leonardo and Raphael did. Mannerist paintings are often full of figures that seem to be twisting, writhing or fighting. The faces of the figures often show strong emotions such as sadness, fear, hatred or sexual feelings.\nNot all the painters who were working during the Mannerist period painted in the Mannerist style. Many artists continued to work in the style of the High Renaissance. Painters in the Mannerist style were Tintoretto, Jacopo Pontormo, Agnolo Bronzino, Parmigianino and Rosso Fiorentino. Giambologna and Benvenuti Cellini were Mannerist sculptors. Giulio Romano was a Mannerist architect.\nMannerism spread from Italy to France, Germany and Spain. One of the most famous Mannerist painters was El Greco who worked in Spain. Some other artists who worked in the Mannerist style are the French sculptor Jean Goujon, the Dutch painter Abraham Bloemaert and the German painter Bartolomeus Spranger. Possibly the strangest paintings from this time were by Giuseppe Arcimboldo who did pictures in which people's faces seem to be made from fruit, flowers, fire and even fish."}

It was made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 1958 until 1979. It only has two rows of seats, which means it is a narrow-body plane. It also has four engines. The name is often said as \"Seven Oh Seven\". There are many different types of 707, and they can hold from 140 to 189 passengers. They can also fly from .\nThe Boeing 707 was Boeing's first jet airliner. It was the most common plane in the 1960s and it was still used a lot during the 1970s. The 707 was the first jet to have a lot of passengers fly on it. The 707 was not the first jet airliner, but it was the first one to make a lot of money. It made Boeing one of the biggest makers of airliners. It also started the group of planes with \"7x7\" names. The Boeing 727, Boeing 737 and Boeing 757 have some parts of the 707's design.\nThe 707's design came from the Boeing 367-80, which was a prototype jet. The very first 707, the 707-120, had Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines. Pan American World Airways started using the 707 on October 26, 1958. Other types of 707 are the 707-138 and the 707-320. Both of these started being used in 1959. A smaller version, the Boeing 720, was made in 1960. The 707-420 had Rolls-Royce Conway 508 turbofan engines. It was made in 1960.\nThe 707 has been used for many different types of flights. Versions of the 707 used by militaries are the E-3 Sentry and the C-137 Stratoliner. Boeing made 1,011 707s (including the 720). More than 800 military planes were made. In August 2011, 10 707s were being used by airlines.\nBy August 2012, there were only two.\nDesigning.\nModel 367-80.\nDuring World War II, and after it, Boeing was known for its military planes. Boeing had made very important bombers, like the propeller B-17 Flying Fortress and B-29 Superfortress and the jet B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress. However, Douglas and other companies were far ahead of Boeing in the airliner market. The only successful airliners Boeing made before the 707 were the Boeing 314 Clipper and Boeing 307 Stratoliner. During 1949\u20131950, Boeing started looking at jets. Back then, aerial refueling (when a plane can get more fuel while flying) was being used a lot. The United States Air Force had ordered 800 KC-97 Stratotankers. Since planes were beginning to use jet engines, the USAF needed a jet tanker.\nBoeing looked at many wing designs and engines for the new tanker. Eventually, it chose the 367\u201380. The \"Dash 80\" took less than two years to make. It first took off on July 15, 1954. It had Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C engines.\nNobody knew if the 707 would make money. Back then, Boeing was making almost all of its money from military planes. The last airliner it made, the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, lost the company $15 million before the United States Air Force bought some and called them the KC-97 Stratotanker. In a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside of Seattle, on August 7, 1955, test pilot Tex Johnston performed a barrel roll in the 367-80 prototype.\nThe Dash 80 was wide. This meant that it was wide enough to have two seats on each side of the plane. Boeing decided to make it wide. However, Douglas had made the DC-8, which was wide. Because of this, Boeing made the 707 wider again, so it was wide.\nMaking and testing.\nThe first flight of the 707 happened on December 20, 1957. The FAA allowed it to fly on September 18, 1958.\nMore changes.\nThe very first type of 707 was the 707-120. Qantas ordered a shorter version, which was called the 707-138. The -138 could fly for as long as Qantas needed. Braniff International Airways ordered a version with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A engines. This version was called the 707-220.\nEven though the 707 should have had turbojet engines, the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D was used the most. The JT3D was a turbofan engine.\nThe last type of 707 was the 707-320C (C means \"Convertible\"). It had a big door for cargo. It also had a better wing.\nBoeing stopped making passenger 707s in 1978. 1,010 707s were made for airlines, but a lot of these went to militaries. Boeing made military 707s until 1991.\nSome parts of the 707's design can be seen in the 737, 727 and 757.\nDesign.\nWings.\nThe 707's wings are swept back at 35 degrees. This means that the wings are not straight lines. Boeing made a yaw damper for swept-wing planes, which was needed because swept-wing planes move strangely if there is not a yaw damper.\nOn one flight, the yaw damper was switched off to give the new pilots some more experience with the plane. One pilot made a bad move, and the plane went out of control. Three of the engines were ripped off of the wing. The plane crashed near Seattle at Arlington, Washington. Four people on board died.\nIn his autobiography, Tex Johnston said he was flying on a 707 and he thought that there was something wrong with the yaw damper, because the plane was moving strangely. He went to the cockpit and helped fix the plane.\nEngines.\nThe 707 used air from the engines to pressurize the cabin.\nThe P&amp;W JT3D-3B engines have special doors which open when the plane is taking off. The doors help to give more air to the engines. The doors close when the plane is in the air.\nBetter engines.\nPratt &amp; Whitney decided to make the JT8D-219 the new engines for planes made from the Boeing 707. A lot of these are for military planes which were designed from the Boeing 707.\nHistory.\nThe first orders for the 707 happened on October 13, 1955. Pan Am ordered 20 707s. There was a lot of competition between the 707 and the Douglas DC-8. A lot of big airlines only used the DC-8. Boeing decided to make some more changes to the 707's wing so that it could fly further. The new version was called the 707-320.\nPan Am was the first airline that used the 707. The plane's first flight was from New York to Paris on October 26, 1958. It stopped for fuel in Gander, Newfoundland. Qantas was the first airline from outside the United States to use the 707.\nThe 707 became a very popular jet airliner. It helped air travel grow a lot. Air traffic control was also upgraded.\nAt the end of the 1960s, the 707 was too small to fly all the passengers that wanted to fly. Boeing made the Boeing 747 because of this. The 707's engines were also too old.\nDuring the Falklands War the Argentine Air Force used 707s to patrol. Some of them were caught by Royal Navy Sea Harriers.\nTrans World Airlines was the last U.S. airline to fly passengers on a 707. The flight happened on October 30, 1983.\nMost 707s are now private jets or cargo planes.\nDifferent types of Boeing 707.\n707-020.\nWhat the Boeing 720 was first called. American Airlines always called its 720s 707s.\n707-120.\nThe \"707-120\" was the first type of 707. The plane could hold 179 passengers. This type often had to stop for fuel in the North Atlantic. It had four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C-6 turbojets. The first flight with passengers was on October 26, 1958. 56 were built, plus 7 short body \u2212138s; the last \u2212120 was delivered to Western in May 1960.\nThe \"707-138\" was a \u2212120 which was ten feet shorter than the others. It could also fly further.\nThe \"707-120B\" had Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-1 turbofan engines. They were a lot better than the others. The \u2212120B had some changes made to the wings. 72 were made.\n707-220.\nThe \"707-220\" had more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A-3 turbojet engines. Five of these were made, but only four were delivered. The first one began being used in December 1959.\n707-320.\nThe \"707-320 Intercontinental\" is a longer version of the 707-120. This type could hold more passengers, and had some changes made to the wings. It first took off on January 11, 1958.\n707-420.\nThe 707-420 was the same as the \u2212320, but it had Rolls-Royce Conway 508 engines. Lufthansa was the first to carry passengers on this type of plane in March 1960.\n707-320B.\nThe \"707-320B\" had a few changes made to the outside of the plane, as well as new engines. The wing was changed. This plane was first used in June 1962 by Pan Am.\n707-320C.\nThe \"707-320C\" could be changed from a passenger plane into a cargo plane. More 707-320Cs were made than any other type. The 707-320C had a cargo door added, as well as some other changes to the wing and the floor.\nMilitary.\nMany militaries have used the 707 for many different things.\nThe Boeing E-3 Sentry is a U.S. military airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft. It has some of the Boeing 707's design.\nThe Canadian Forces also used Boeing 707s. These were called the CC-137 Husky (707-347C) from 1972 to 1997.\n717.\n\"Boeing 717\" was what Boeing called the C-135 Stratolifter and KC-135 Stratotanker. The McDonnell Douglas MD-95's name was changed to Boeing 717 after Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas.\nUsers.\nIn the 1980s, the USAF bought 250 used 707s for parts for the KC-135E Stratotanker.\n707s are not used anymore by big airlines. However, as of December 2012, 10 707s were being used. John Travolta owns a 707-138B.\nAccidents.\nAs of May 2011, the 707 has had 170 hull-loss accidents. 2,739 people have died in Boeing 707 accidents. A hull-loss accident is when the plane is damaged so much that it cannot be fixed.\nDetails.\nSources:"}

The desirable reactions create chemicals called alkanes. Sometimes the gas methane (natural gas) is produced, which is generally undesirable. Sometimes, different kinds of alcohol are produced in small amounts.\nOther reactions relevant to F-T.\nMany steps are required to make the gases needed for the F-T process. For example, all chemicals entering the reactor must have all sulfur removed. For factories that start out with methane and want to make a liquid hydrocarbon (like kerosene), another important reaction is \"steam reforming\", which turns the methane into CO (carbon monoxide) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\nThis is the chemical equation for how steam reforming works. \nThe reaction above describes one molecule of H2O (steam) plus one molecule of CH4 (methane) converts into one molecule of CO (carbon monoxide) and three molecules of H2 (hydrogen gas).\nFischer-Tropsch catalysts.\nA catalyst is a substance added to change the rate of a chemical reaction, generally to make it faster. Many different catalysts can be used for the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process. The most common catalysts are the metals cobalt, iron, and ruthenium. These metals are all transition metals. The metal nickel can also be used, but generally with unwanted results. A nickel catalyst in the reaction usually produces a lot of methane, which is undesirable.\nCobalt seems to be the most active catalyst (it has the greatest and fastest effect on the process). When the input is a natural gas, cobalt catalysts are very good for the Fischer-Tropsch process. Iron catalysts are better when the input gas is of lower quality (less pure) such as coal or biomass. \nMost metals used for this process (like cobalt, nickel, and ruthenium) remain in their metal form when added to the process. However, iron catalysts behave very differently. Often, iron catalysts change form and chemical phase, like converting into various oxides and carbides during the reaction. It is important to control all of the iron reactions during the process, or else the process may not work correctly.\nFischer-Tropsch catalysts are famous for being extremely sensitive to the addition of sulfur. Even a tiny amount of sulfur can have an undesirable impact on the reaction. Cobalt catalysis is more sensitive to sulfur than iron.\nHTFT and LTFT.\nHigh-Temperature Fischer-Tropsch (or HTFT) is performed at temperatures of 330\u00b0C-350\u00b0C. HTFT uses an iron-based catalyst. Sasol used HTFT in Coal-to-Liquid plants (CTL). Low-Temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) is performed at lower temperatures and uses a cobalt-based catalyst. Shell used LTFT in an integrated Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) plant in Bintulu, Malaysia.\nGasification.\nSome F-T factories use coal, biomass or other solid compounds as a starting point. Before these factories can begin the F-T process, they must turn the solids into gases such as CO, H2, and alkanes. Changing solid chemical compounds into gas is called gasification. The gas collected from coal gasification often has a CO/H2 ratio of ~0.7 instead of the optimal ratio of ~2. This ratio can be adjusted from 0.7 to 2.0 using the water-gas shift reaction. Gasification is a dirty and expensive process. Coal-based Fischer\u2013Tropsch factories start out with coal, gasify the coal, and then use the resulting gas as feed stock for the Fischer-Tropsch process. These factories can produce large volumes of CO2 in this way. One of the main reasons for this approach is the large amounts of energy required for a coal-based gasification process.\nHistory.\nThe original process was invented by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch while working at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in the 1920s. Since then, many improvements have been made. The term \"Fischer-Tropsch\" now is used for many similar processes. Fischer and Tropsch submitted several patents, like US patent no. 1,746,464, applied for in 1926, and published in 1930. It was given to the factories in Germany in 1936. Germany had an abundance of coal but very little petroleum. The F-T process enables the conversion of coal into gasoline, which is important for gasoline-based transport like cars, airplanes, and trucks. As a result, during World War II, the F-T process enabled Nazi Germany and Japan to produce substitute fuels for tanks and cars. F-T fuel production made up about 9% of German wartime fuel production and 25% of the automobile fuel.\nThe United States Bureau of Mines ran a program started by the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act. The Bureau hired seven fuel scientists from Operation Paperclip to work in a Fischer-Tropsch plant in Louisiana, Missouri in 1946. Operation Paperclip was a project to recruit German scientists to work for the US after World War II.\nCommercialization.\nThe F-T process has been used by many large companies, however the process is unpopular for many reasons. F-T factory equipment is expensive, and has high operating and maintenance costs. Also, petroleum, which competes with F-T products, has very unpredictable prices. Usually, factories are only profitable when they have access to \"stranded gas\". \"Stranded gas\" is the name for sources of natural gas very far from major cities that are too expensive to pump to consumers. If the natural gas could be pumped to these cities and sold directly to consumers, it would be much more profitable. Therefore, several companies are developing processes to enable practical exploitation of so-called stranded gas reserves.\nSasol.\nThe largest F-T factories with the largest application of F-T technology are owned and operated by the company Sasol in South Africa. South Africa is a country with large coal reserves but not enough oil to meet demand. Germany is in a similar situation. Sasol employs coal and natural gas in the F-T Process. They produce many different substitutes for oil products, and produce most of the country's diesel fuel.\nShell Middle Distillate Synthesis.\nOne of the largest uses of F-T technology is in Bintulu, Malaysia. This Shell factory turns natural gas into low-sulfur diesel fuels and food-grade wax. They produce approximately 12,000 barrels/day.\nIn October 2006, Finnish paper and pulp manufacturer UPM announced its plans to produce biodiesel using the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process. It said that it will do this along with the manufacturing processes at its European paper and pulp plants. It will use waste biomass from paper and pulp manufacturing as raw material for biodiesel.\nResearch developments.\nCarbon dioxide reuse.\nIn 2009, chemists working for the U.S. Navy studied Fischer-Tropsch for making fuels with hydrogen from electrolyzed seawater. With the usually optimal cobalt catalyst, this study produced mostly methane gas. Use of an iron catalyst, however, resulted in only 30% methane in the product; the rest consisted of short-chain hydrocarbons. Further refining of the hydrocarbons produced could lead to the creation of kerosene-based jet fuel.\nThe abundance of CO2 makes seawater look like a good alternative fuel source. Scientists at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said that, \"although the gas forms only a small proportion of air \u2013 around 0.04 per cent \u2013 ocean water contains about 140 times that concentration\". However this often-repeated statement is misleading because while the density of CO2 and related compounds in seawater is about 200x the density of CO2 in air on a per cubic meter basis, carbon dioxide compounds are only about 1/4 the density on a per kg basis."}

Brown supported using violence to end slavery in the United States. He first got national attention when he led small groups of people during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of 1856.\nIn October 1859, Brown led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia). He wanted to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the areas of Virginia and North Carolina. He took control of the armory, but seven people were killed, and ten or more were injured. Brown wanted to arm slaves with weapons from the armory. However, few local slaves joined his attack. Within 36 hours, Brown's men were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, and U.S. Marines. Brown was executed by hanging for treason against the state of Virginia on December 2, 1859. He was the first person executed for treason in the history of the United States.\nBrown is still a controversial person today. He is both remembered as a heroic martyr, and he is hated as a madman and a terrorist.\nEarly years.\nJohn Brown was born May 9, 1800, in Torrington, Connecticut. He was the fourth of the eight children of Owen Brown (1771\u20131856) and Ruth Mills (1772\u20131808) and grandson of Capt. John Brown (1728\u20131776). Brown's ancestors were 17th-century English Puritans.\nIn 1805, the family moved to Hudson, Ohio. Owen Brown opened a tannery here. Hudson had a lot of anti-slavery activity. Owen was a part of it. Owen provided a safe house to Underground Railroad fugitives. There was not a high school in Hudson at that time, so John studied at the school of the abolitionist Elizur Wright. Elizur Wright was the father of Elizur Wright, in nearby Tallmadge.\nThe father of Ulysses S. Grant, Jesse R. Grant, was Owen Brown's apprentice.\nWhen he was 16 years old, Brown left his family and went to Plainfield, Massachusetts. He joined a preparatory program. Shortly afterward, he went to the Morris Academy in Litchfield, Connecticut.\nIn 1820, Brown married Dianthe Lusk. Their first child, John Jr, was born 13 months later. In 1825, looking for a safer place (for fugitive slaves), Brown and his family moved to New Richmond, Pennsylvania. He bought of land. He cleared an eighth of it, and he built a cabin, a barn, and a tannery. The tannery had a secret room to hide escaping slaves. The John Brown Tannery Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It \"was a major stop on the [Underground] Railroad, marking its place in history from 1825 to 1835.\" During that period, \"Brown helped an estimated 2,500 slaves escape.\"\nIn 1829, some white families asked Brown to help them remove Native Americans who hunted annually in the area. Brown told them, \"I will have nothing to do with [such a] mean act. I would [rather] take my gun and help [remove] you from the country.\" Throughout his life, Brown kept peaceful relations with his Native American neighbors. Sometimes he would go with them on hunting trips, and he invited them to eat in his home.\nIn 1831, one of his sons died. Brown became sick, and his businesses started to do poorly. This made Brown have a lot of debt. In the summer of 1832, shortly after the death of a newborn son, his wife Dianthe died. The only family he had left were his children John Jr., Jason, Owen, and Ruth. (Another three of their children died before they became adults.) On June 14, 1833, Brown married 16-year-old Mary Ann Day (April 15, 1817 \u2013 May 1, 1884). She was from Washington County, New York. They had 13 children; those alive at John Brown's death were Salmon, Annie, Sarah, and Ellen.\nIn 1836, Brown moved his family to Franklin Mills, Ohio (now known as Kent). There, he borrowed money to buy land in the area. He built and operated a tannery along the Cuyahoga River. His partner was Zenas Kent.\nIn 1837, when he learned that Elijah P. Lovejoy was murdered, Brown promised: \"Here, before God, [with witnesses around me], from [now on], I (dedicate) my life to the destruction of slavery!\"\nHe strongly believed in Christianity. He believed that Christians should treat people the same no matter what color their skin was. Many white Christians in America at this time did not agree with this.\nKansas and the Pottawatomie Massacre.\nBrown lived mostly in Springfield, Massachusetts before moving to the Kansas Territory. This would later become the state of Kansas in 1861. Several of his sons were already living there. Brown's sons wanted his help to fight people from Missouri. The people in Missouri wanted slavery to be legal in Kansas. On May 24, 1856, Brown and his sons killed five people in Kansas who wanted slavery to be legal. They dragged the people out of their homes and killed them with swords. This came to be known as the Pottawatomie massacre. Many people in Kansas were shocked and upset about this. More violent things happened after this. This was the beginning of the period in the Kansas Territory known as Bleeding Kansas. Before leaving Kansas, Brown and his followers were attacked at the Battle of Osawatomie on August 30, 1856. His son Frederick was killed there.\nHarper's Ferry.\nIn 1859, Brown decided to attack the Harpers Ferry Armory in Harper's Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). He was planning on giving the weapons to slaves. The slaves would use the weapons to fight against their masters and become free. Brown attacked the arsenal in October 1859. His sons and several other men, including several black men, helped him with the attack. His attack failed. Brown was captured, and was executed by hanging for treason against the state of Virginia on December 2, 1859.\nDeath and aftermath.\nOn the morning of December 2, 1859, Brown wrote:\nI, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, [naively thought] that [it could be done without much bloodshed].\nHe read his Bible and wrote a final letter to his wife. The letter included his will. At 11:00\u00a0a.m. he was taken from the county jail through a crowd of 2,000 soldiers a few blocks away. He was taken to a small field where the gallows were. Among the soldiers in the crowd were future Confederate general Stonewall Jackson, and John Wilkes Booth (Booth borrowed a militia uniform to watch the execution). The poet Walt Whitman, in \"Year of Meteors\", described watching the execution.\nBrown chose to receive no religious services in the jail or at the scaffold. He was hanged at 11:15\u00a0a.m. He was declared dead at 11:50\u00a0a.m.\nAftermath of the raid.\nThe raid on Harpers Ferry is generally thought to have pushed the United States towards civil war. Southern slaveowners, hearing early reports that hundreds of abolitionists were involved, were glad the action was so small. However, they feared other abolitionists would also try to lead slave rebellions. Therefore, the South reorganized the old militia system. These militias became a ready-made Confederate army, making the South better prepared for war.\nMany abolitionists in the North believed Brown was a martyr, and that he sacrificed for the evils of the nation. Immediately after the raid, William Lloyd Garrison published a column in \"The Liberator\". He said Brown's raid \"[meant well] but sadly unwise\" and \"wild and [pointless]\". However, he defended Brown's character from haters in the Northern and Southern press. He argued that those who supported the ideas of the American Revolution could not consistently oppose Brown's raid. On the day Brown was hanged, Garrison said in Boston: \"whenever [it happens], I all slave revolts succeed\".\nAfter the Civil War, Frederick Douglass wrote, \"His zeal in the cause of my race was far greater than mine ... I could live for the slave, but he could die for him.\"\nPublic opinion.\nPeople had strong feelings about John Brown. Some people thought that he was crazy or evil. Other people thought that he was a hero. His attack on Harpers Ferry helped lead to the American Civil War. The war would start in 1861.\nMany Black leaders of the timeMartin Delany, Henry Highland Garnet, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubmanknew and respected Brown. \"Tubman thought Brown was the greatest white man who ever lived.\" Douglass called him \"a brave and glorious old man.\"\nBlack businesses in the North closed on the day of his execution. Church bells rang across the North."}

She is a demigod, meaning she is half-mortal and half goddess. Her father is the mortal Frederick Chase and her mother is Athena, the goddess of wisdom, crafts, arts, and battle strategy. She is first cousins with Magnus Chase, whose mother is her paternal aunt. She appears first in the first novel of the series, \"The Lightning Thief\". Throughout the series she becomes close friends with Percy Jackson, later becoming his main love interest and girlfriend.\nAnnabeth is architect of Olympus and one of the leaders in Camp Half Blood for half bloods/demigods.\nShe is played by the actress Alexandra Daddario in the movie \"\", which is based off the first book, \"The Lightning Thief. Also played the same part in the movie \" The Sea of Monsters\", which is based on the novel \"Percy Jackson: The Sea of Monsters\".\" \nShe is played by Kristin Stokes in the musical \"The\" \"Lightning\" \"Thief:\" \"The\" \"Percy\" \"Jackson\" \"Musical\", which is based off of the first novel in the series, \"The Lightning Thief\"\nDevelopment.\nThe writer of the books, Rick Riordan, was asked in an interview, \"Do you feel those who said the main characters, such as Grover and Annabeth, are heroes in their own right?\". He answered, \"Annabeth is Percy's rational side. She can think through things and look at options that sometimes evade Percy in his moments of battle panic.\" This means she can think even when there is a fight going on, unlike Percy, and can find solutions to problems. That is also why Annabeth is a daughter of Athena because she is the goddess of wisdom and battle strategy.\nFictional biography.\nAnnabeth Chase is the half-blood daughter of the goddess Athena and the mortal man Frederick Chase. She was born July 12, 1993. Being a daughter of Athena, who is a virgin, she was not physically born, but is a literal 'brain child'; she was born as a gift to the man her mother loved. When she was seven, she ran away from home. On her journey, she met Luke Castellan, Thalia Grace, and Grover Underwood. Together, they traveled to Camp Half-Blood, running from and fighting hordes of monsters. When they got to the borders of Camp half blood,Thalia made her final stand fighting monsters so that Luke, Grover and Annabeth could safely get into camp. Thalia's father, Zeus, changes her into a pine tree on top of a hill that comes to be known as Thalia's Pine Tree. Annabeth lived at Camp Half-Blood for five years prior to Percy Jackson's arrival.\nIt has been shown that Annabeth does not get along with her father and step-family. According to her, her father was not very happy when she first appeared and tends to look at her as a nuisance. Her step-siblings appear to dislike her and feel afraid of her. Her stepmother seems to hate her and feel that she endangers the family by being only half-mortal. At the end of \"The Lightning Thief\", Annabeth returns to her family to see if she can get along with them. She is able to stay with them for approximately a year, but it is unknown if her feeling towards her family have changed; however, in \"The Titan's Curse\", her father and stepmother seem to care for her deeply, and her father helps fight off Kronos's army to save Annabeth.\nAnnabeth is a good fighter, and has been shown to be able to think on her feet in very hard situations. Despite this, Annabeth dreams of being an architect (building things), and the story has made many references to this. In \"The Lightning Thief\", she enjoys and quickly becomes addicted to the 3-D holographic SimCity-esque game at the Lotus Hotel and Casino, and in \"The Sea of Monsters\", it was shown that Annabeth\u2019s greatest dream is to redesign the whole world to make it better, make Luke good again, and be accepted by her mother and father. In \"The Last Olympian\", she is granted the status of being the architect of Olympus.\nHubris, or deadly pride, is Annabeth's fatal flaw. Annabeth thinks that she is able to do anything: get her parents back together, build great monuments, and save Luke, as shown in the second book. She sometimes even thinks she can rebuild the world into an even better place than the immortals did. She also has a deep fear of spiders, (arachnophobia), due to the contest between Athena and Arachne.\nAnnabeth is described as being athletic and having curly blond hair (like a princess's), tan skin, and stormy gray eyes. Percy Jackson describes her as \"cute\" at first but eventually she becomes \"seriously beautiful.\"\nIn the books.\n\"The Lightning Thief\".\nAnnabeth first appears in \"The Lightning Thief\" and is twelve years old. She was nicknamed \"Wise Girl\" by Clarisse, in a spat of insults. The name was meant as an insult but, now it's an affectionate pet name. \nShe first meets Percy Jackson after he was attacked by the Minotaur and makes his way into Half-Blood Hill. When he first saw her, Percy described Annabeth as \"pretty\" with blond hair curled \"like a princess\" After Percy heals from the Minotaur attack, Annabeth hears that he is to go on a quest (search) and she wants to go along, thinking Percy is \"the one\" from The Great Prophecy. Together, she, Percy, and Grover go searching for Zeus's stolen lightning bolt. Throughout the book, Annabeth shows her unique intelligence, which she inherited from her mother, and also her arachnophobia (fear of spiders) that she shares with all her siblings on her mother's side (originating from the story of Arachne and Athena)\n\"The Sea of Monsters\".\nAnnabeth, Percy and Tyson, having not been allowed to go on the quest for the Golden Fleece to save Thalia's Pine Tree and find Grover by Chiron's temporary replacement, sneak out of Camp Half-Blood to do so. During the book it is revealed that Annabeth's greatest dream is to redesign the whole world to improve it, save Luke (from himself), and be accepted by her mother and father. After getting stranded on the island of the Queen-Witch Circe, Annabeth saves Percy after he is turned into a Guinea Pig using the multivitamins given to them by Hermes. During the fight with Polyphemus Annabeth (while invisible with the use of her Yankee's Cap) pretends to be Nobody and distracts him long enough for Percy to vanquish him. Annabeth is injured fatally during the fight but is healed with the help of the Golden Fleece.\n\"The Titan's Curse\".\nAnnabeth is kidnapped along with the goddess Artemis and has to be saved by Percy, Thalia, Grover, and the huntresses Zo\u00eb Nightshade and Bianca di Angelo. In a dream Percy has, Annabeth is on a mountain, and she sees Luke holding up a black roof (unknown to Percy, it is the sky). Annabeth helps him hold it, and then Luke slips out from underneath, making Annabeth hold it. This is later used to trick Artemis into holding the sky, as Artemis would not be able to resist helping a maiden. Unlike the other books, Annabeth's role is quite small. It is hinted in this book that there will be a romantic future for her and Percy. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, also convinced Percy about his feelings for Annabeth, though she also made it even harder for them to fall in love. In the end, Percy saves both Annabeth and Artemis, while Thalia is fighting Luke until he falls off a cliff.\n\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\".\nBy this book, Annabeth is fourteen. Percy and Annabeth find an entrance into the Labyrinth. She realizes that Luke may try to use this entrance to invade Camp.\nAnnabeth leads the quest into the Labyrinth, fulfilling one of her ambitions. She goes into the Labyrinth with Percy, Grover, and Tyson to find a way to stop Kronos's evil forces from entering the borders of Camp Half-Blood by searching for the Labyrinth's inventor, Daedalus. The prophecy the Oracle gave her appears to have scared her and she refuses to say the last line. As they go into the Labyrinth, they face many hardships. Annabeth faces a Sphinx and finds the riddles (which are actually factual questions) not challenging and an insult to her intellect. They escape the claws of the Sphinx and continue on to find Hephaestus so he can tell them about where to find Daedalus.\nAs they head towards Hephaestus' forge in Mount St. Helens, they find telekhines there making a weapon for Kronos. Percy tells Annabeth to escape while she can. She kisses him for luck and they part ways. Annabeth believes that he dies when Mount St. Helens erupts, but this is not the case. Percy fell onto the island Ogygia, prison of the nymph Calypso, a daughter of Atlas. When Percy comes back to camp, Annabeth is performing a funeral ritual for him. When she notices him, she hugs him, making a scene. However, when she finds out about Calypso, she is very jealous. Percy then asks a mortal girl, Rachel Elizabeth Dare, to help them on their way through the Labyrinth (Rachel has a rare ability to see through the Mist). Annabeth becomes very jealous at how close Percy and Rachel are getting. The three of them discover Luke, who has become Kronos's vessel. After a battle, Luke is forced back into the Labyrinth, leaving two casualties. Annabeth refuses to believe that Luke is all bad, and gets quite mad at Percy for saying otherwise.\nAfter they fulfilled their mission, Annabeth and Percy are standing on Half-Blood Hill, and are matching their goals with the prophecy, Annabeth reveals the last line of her prophecy, \"To lose a love to worse than death\" and is confused, not sure about her feelings for Luke, or a secret love for Percy. At the end she leaves with her dad to go to a private school in San Francisco.\n\"The Last Olympian\".\nIn the final book, Annabeth first appears when Percy returns from blowing up Kronos's ship, the \"Princess Andromeda\". Following his arrival, Annabeth helps Percy hear the Great Prophecy. Percy bathes in the River Styx (he narrowly escapes by imagining Annabeth pulling him out of the river) and calls Annabeth, telling her to meet him in front of the Empire State Building with all the demigods from Camp Half Blood. When Annabeth and Percy go to Olympus, they meet Hermes, to whom Annabeth tries to apologize about Luke turning into Kronos. Hermes becomes angry at her and blames her for not saving Luke. Hermes leaves, and they return to the other campers to defend Manhattan and Mount Olympus. In battle, Ethan Nakamura attempts to stab Percy in the small of his back, his Achilles spot, and Annabeth jumps in front of him, taking the knife. After a few hours of rest, Annabeth, though still weak from poison, goes back into battle. Kronos goes to Olympus, and Grover, Thalia, Percy, and Annabeth follow him. Kronos attacks Percy, and Annabeth joins the fight, but is knocked out of the fight when Kronos slams her into Athena's throne. In the end, she saves Percy and Olympus by finally realizing the prophecy's true meaning. She convinces Percy to give Luke her knife (which was given to her by Luke when she was seven) so he can stab himself, killing himself and banishing Kronos to Tartarus yet again. She is rewarded by the gods, who allow her to use her talents as an architect to rebuild Mount Olympus. Percy Jackson refuses immortality because of his feelings for Annabeth. At Camp Half-Blood in the dining hall later that day, Annabeth kisses Percy after he admits his feelings for her. She warns him that she will never make things easy for him. After this, they kiss underwater after eavesdropers dump them into the canoe lake.\n\"Magnus Chase And The Gods Of Asgard\".\nMagnus Chase And The Gods Of Asgard, Book 1 The Sword of Summer\nAnnabeth appears in this book searching, with her dad, for cousin Magnus.\nMagnus Chase And The Gods Of Asgard, Book 2 The Hammer of Thor\nPercy appears at the end of the book when Magnus Chase learns that he needs to go somewhere called the \"Ship of Dead\". He goes to ask Annabeth for tips, in which Annabeth quotes \"I don't know much about the sea, but my boyfriend does. It's time you met Percy...\"\nMagnus Chase And The Gods Of Asgard, Book 3 The Ship of Dead\nIn the beginning of the book the first chapter is called \"Percy Jackson Does His Level Best to Kill Me\". Annabeth and Percy give tips about the sea get kind've itchy because Magnus sucks at everything that came to the ocean, nearly getting himself killed.\nIn the movie.\nIn the movie, Alexandra Daddario plays Annabeth, a warrior at Camp Half-Blood with Percy and potential romantic interest. In the movie trailer, Annabeth says to Percy, \"I definitely have strong feelings for you. I just haven't decided if they are positive or negative yet.\" Another scene shows them leaning in, seemingly to kiss. It was really a tease, which was revealed when she suddenly steals Percy's sword from his sheath and at the brings her own sword to his throat and says, \"First rule of battle strategy, never let your opponent distract you.\" In the movie, Annabeth is seen with brown, straight hair, a definite change from the book's description of her (with curly blonde hair). She is shown in the movie with blue eyes not gray. She does not display much love towards Luke. \nRomance.\nA key subplot in the series is the relationship between Annabeth, Percy, and Luke. Luke is Annabeth's hero and one of her first half-blood friends. Annabeth likes Percy, which she hints at, but she still has feelings towards Luke. At the end of \"The Last Olympian\", Luke shows slight feelings for her, sort of like an older brother. These feeling are present despite the fact that Luke and Percy are arch enemies and he has attempted to kill Percy many times. In \"The Sea of Monsters\", it is shown that one of her life's wishes is to save Luke from Kronos.\nIn the beginning of \"The Lightning Thief\", Annabeth is shown to dislike Percy when she finds out that Percy is the hero of the prophecy. She thinks he is weak, and is influenced by the rivalry between her mother, Athena, and Percy's father, Poseidon. But while they are on their quest, they have to ride a truck to get to their destination. This is the first time they actually talk. In \"The Mark of Athena\", Annabeth says that's when she chose to \"like\" him. At the very end of \"The Sea of Monsters\" Annabeth kisses Percy on the cheek after winning the chariot race. In \"The Titan's Curse\", there are suggestions of some romance between Annabeth and Percy, although this is complicated by her lingering feelings towards Luke and the fact that her mother, Athena, disapproves of her \"friendship\" with Percy. In \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\", Annabeth finally expresses her feelings for Percy by kissing him good luck before vanishing using her Yankee's cap. When Percy returns, she is highly jealous, because she knows he has been with the sad but seductive Calypso. It is implied that Percy is trying to tell Annabeth about his feelings, but Annabeth remains distant,still due to her lingering feelings towards Luke.\nIn \"The Last Olympian\", after the defeat of Kronos and the saving of Luke's soul, the romantic relationship between Percy and Annabeth is solidified. Annabeth also states Percy looks 'cute when he's worried' when he first checks on her after she took a knife that was meant for him. Annabeth tells Luke as he dies that she always saw him as a brother, but never loved him. Later, she and Percy share their second kiss after she tells him that she will never, ever make things easy for him. He describes it as if his brain felt it was melting through his body. But nosy campers snoop on this and throw them into the camp lake. Then comes a third kiss underwater in an air bubble made by Percy. They are together at the end of the series. It is hinted that they might be married one day in the future, as Annabeth said she wanted \"to build something permanent,\" and Percy states that maybe they were \"getting a good start together.\u201d\nReception.\nIn the books.\nB. Allison Gray praises how in \"Battle of the Labyrinth: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 4\", Riordan \"successfully conveys Annabeth's emotions.\"\nIn the movie.\nThe casting for the movie has had a different reception. On one hand, as \"Rama's SCREEN\" reports, \"the one that\u2019s been causing argument is Alexandra Daddario as Annabeth Chase...apparently some of Rama\u2019s SCREEN readers out there did and the comments on her casting were in mixed response...Ashley thought Annasophia Robb (Race To Witch Mountain) should\u2019ve played that role meanwhile Kara and Victoria saw Daddario as too old because apparently, the character Annabeth Chase in the book is about 12 years old but Lily thought Daddario should be given a chance to prove herself worthy and Joe said that to make this work, the movie needs to make her hot, athletic, with blond hair and grey eyes.\" On the other hand, Katey Rich writes that Daddario \"looks just right for that Hermione-esque role of the brainy brunette...Daddario, who has been in movies like \"The Hottest State\" and the recent , may have just signed on for a role that will take over her life, poo and bring her plenty of Emma Watson-scaled fame in the process. I hope she's got her wizard's wand-- oh, wait, I mean mythical god powers-- ready for the challenge.\""}

He is a demigod, meaning he is half-mortal and half god. His father is Poseidon, the god of the sea, and his mother is the mortal Sally Jackson.\nFirst introduced in \"The Lightning Thief\" as a troubled twelve-year old who finds out that he is a demigod, Percy goes on many adventures in the series to save his friends and the gods of Mount Olympus.\nPercy is played by Logan Lerman in the movie \"\" and in \".\"\nPersonality.\nPercy is good-natured, friendly, brave, and willing to risk his life to save his friends, strangers, and even his enemies. He is angered by Thalia Grace because their personalities are similar, they argue even though they are good friends. Percy has a sarcastic sense of humor and is funny in his writing.\nPercy dislikes nicknames or titles being given to him, with the exception of those given by Annabeth Chase. He always tells horses, which his father is said to have created, not to call him \"boss\" or \"lord\" whenever they talk to him but does not get annoyed when Annabeth calls him \"seaweed-brain\". His fatal flaw is loyalty. Percy, like most boys his age, has trouble talking to girls. Athena said that Percy's fatal flaw is personal loyalty. He will do anything to save his friends and loved ones. Kronos uses this flaw to control him several times in the series, such as when his mother is held hostage when Grover is trapped on Polyphemus' island, and when Annabeth is kidnapped.\nIn the books.\n\"The Lightning Thief\".\nPerseus \"Percy\" Jackson is introduced as a troubled 12-year-old boy who is a student with dyslexia, which makes it hard for him to read, and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), which makes it hard for him to pay attention. He has been kicked out of every single school he has gone to. He has just been kicked out of Yancy Academy in Upstate New York. He has few friends at the school, his best friend being Grover Underwood, a satyr (half human, half goat) disguised as a human.\nDuring a field trip to a museum, Percy is annoyed by the school bully,\u00a0Nancy Bobofit, for intimidating Grover and in a fit of rage, accidentally summons water from a nearby fountain to pull her in, but he didn't know how he did it.\u00a0Mrs. Dodds, his pre-algebra teacher, witnesses the whole scene and tells him to follow her into the museum for a \"talk.\" Suddenly, she turns into the\u00a0Fury\u00a0Alecto, and attacks him, looking like a bat-like figure with humongous fangs. Percy manages to destroy her using\u00a0Mr. Brunner\u2019s pen,\u00a0Riptide, that transforms into a sword in his hand. However, when Percy returns to the bus and asks his classmates, nobody remembers Mrs. Dodds because of a force known as the\u00a0Mist. The only person that may remember her was Grover, who always hesitated before he answered. Everybody else believed her name was Mrs. Kerr.\nPercy asks what just happened, and Mr. Brunner says he saw nothing and that Percy should bring his own things to write with in the future. Percy asks his classmates about it, but they act like there was never any \"Mrs. Dodds\". Percy sees that Grover is lying when he hesitates whenever Percy mentions \"Mrs. Dodds\". Percy overhears Grover and Mr. Brunner talking about him later in the school year. As he is going home on a bus with Grover, he sees three old ladies knitting a giant sock. Grover looks really worried about them. Percy leaves Grover at the bus stop and takes a taxi to his apartment on his own.\nHis mother arrives soon after he gets home and tells him that they can go to Montauk Beach for the entire weekend. Percy is happy that something good has finally happened and packs his things and leaves. At the beach, Percy wakes up in the middle of the night in a storm and is shocked to see Grover coming to him and his mom, telling them to leave. Percy is confused, but his mother takes them both in the car and drives quickly away.\nAfter hearing a growl behind them, his mom arrives at a hill and pushes both boys out of the car. Percy sees that the thing chasing them is a Minotaur, who charges them. Percy and his mom dodge it, but Grover is too slow and the Minotaur charges him. Percy manages to defeat the Minotaur, but not before it dissolves Percy's mother into light and sends her to the Underworld. Percy drags Grover up the hill to Camp Half-Blood, where Percy passes out on the doorway of the Big House.\nPercy learns that Camp Half-Blood is a place for demigods like him. He meets a future friend, Annabeth Chase. He learns that Mr. Brunner is actually the centaur (half human, half horse) Chiron, the camp's activity director. He also learns that the director of the camp is the god Dionysus. He is introduced to Luke Castellan, the leader of the Hermes cabin. Later, in a capture-the-flag game, Percy single-handed defeats Clarisse, leader of the Ares cabin, and three others when he healed his injuries in water. This is when he learned that he is the son of Poseidon as a holographic trident appears over his head. Soon after learning that Zeus's lightning bolt has been stolen, Percy embarks on his first and eventually successful quest along with Grover and Annabeth to retrieve it.\n\"The Sea of Monsters\".\nThalia's tree, the magical border of Camp Half-Blood, has been poisoned. Chiron is blamed for the poisoning and is dismissed from camp; Tantalus, who comes from the Fields of Punishment and cannot have food or water, takes the job. The only thing able to rid the tree of its poison is the Golden Fleece, which is located on the island of Polyphemus (another son of Poseidon), in the Sea of Monsters (the Bermuda Triangle).\nClarisse, the daughter of Ares and longtime enemy of Percy, is given the quest to go into the Sea of Monsters to bring back the Golden Fleece, which has healing powers for plants, animals, and humans. Percy and Annabeth decide to go also, not just for the Golden Fleece, but for their friend Grover who is trapped in Polyphemus' cave. Tyson, a young Cyclops whom Percy befriended at school that year, joins them on their journey. Tyson is Poseidon's son and therefore Percy's half-brother.\nAs they enter the Sea of Monsters, they have to get past Scylla and Charybdis. Instead of trying to sail in between the two, Clarisse automatically goes for Charybdis and Tyson supposedly dies in Clarisse's ship after it sinks. After that, Percy and Annabeth journey to many dangerous islands, and Annabeth tells Percy many things about how Thalia died and she also mentions her prophecy and tells Percy that he has a choice to make when he becomes 16 years old. Fighting their way through many other obstacles, like the Sirens and Circe's island, they join up with Clarisse, Grover, and later Tyson (who did not die), and leave with the Golden Fleece.\nWhen they return to the mortal world, they send off Clarisse on an airplane to camp alone, and Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson are kidnapped by Luke. In a duel with him, Percy is nearly killed. He is saved by Chiron, who is proven innocent, and his relatives, the Party Ponies. When they return to camp the Fleece is put on the tree. The Fleece not only revives Thalia's tree, but Thalia too. It turns out that this was actually Kronos's plan, done so that he would have another chance to control the prophecy which governs the future of Olympus and the Olympians.\nAt the end Percy and Annabeth win a chariot race and Annabeth kisses Percy on the cheek and he liked it so he kissed her back.\n\"The Titan's Curse\".\nIn the third book, Grover finds two demigods at a school, Bianca and Nico di Angelo. Percy, Grover, Thalia and two of Artemis' hunters, Zo\u00eb and Bianca (who later chose to become a hunter, upsetting Nico), are sent on a quest to save Artemis, who has been kidnapped. Percy is really going to save Annabeth, who was captured while they were saving the di Angelo's.\nDuring the journey, Percy meets a mortal girl at Hoover Dam, named Rachel Elizabeth Dare, who can see through the Mist. She helps him escape from skeletal warriors who were trying to attack Percy and his friends.\nWhile warning them about the junkyard of the gods, Aphrodite, goddess of love, tells Percy there is a romantic future waiting for him with Annabeth. Bianca is killed by a crazed robot in the junkyard of the gods while trying to get a figurine for her brother Nico. She said it was the only figurine he was missing in his collection. During the battle with Atlas, Zo\u00eb receives deadly injuries; she is poisoned by her old friend Ladon; her father, Atlas, makes the final strike that kills her and Atlas holds the burden of holding the sky again. Upon entering Olympus, the Gods decide whether to kill Thalia, Percy and Bessie (the ophiotaurus) who may hold the decision to tear down Olympus according to the Great Prophecy. Thalia becomes one of Artemis' hunters, eliminating her as a potential recipient of the Great Prophecy. In the end, the gods decide to leave Percy alive and keep the Ophiotaurus in safety at the throne room. Afterward, a feast is held in honor of the heroes and Athena tells Percy that she disapproves of his friendship with her daughter. At camp, Percy tells Nico about Bianca's death; he sprints into the woods. From then on, Nico hates Percy, blaming him for his sister's death. Annabeth, Percy and Grover search for Nico and cannot find him. Percy then holds the figurine of the god Bianca gave him at the junk yard. Suddenly, he realizes who Nico's father is: Hades, lord of the dead.\n\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\".\nIn book four, the Labyrinth of Daedalus is discovered. Camp Half-Blood is in danger of being invaded by Kronos' army by means of the Labyrinth. Chiron sends Annabeth along with Percy, Grover, and Tyson into the Labyrinth on a quest to find Daedalus. In this, they hope to use his knowledge to help thwart any attacks that are carried out using the giant underground maze. They eventually find Daedalus, who has made himself a new body, and has disguised himself as the swordplay counselor.\nThere is a battle, as Kronos' army attacks Camp Half-Blood through the Labyrinth. Many are injured and some are left dead. Daedalus shows up to help along with his giant pet hellhound, Mrs. O'Leary. Daedalus has escaped death for centuries, but gives himself over to Nico di Angelo, a son of Hades, so he can accept his punishment in the Underworld and also so he can see his son Icarus and his nephew Perdix. Percy inherits Mrs. O'Leary; they have grown fond of each other. Percy and Annabeth's relationship starts to take on a new edge to it. Annabeth saves Percy several times and kisses him once because she thinks he is going to die. She also makes a big scene in front of all the campers when she realized that Percy was alive.\n\"The Last Olympian\".\nIn book five, Percy discovers the truth behind the Great Prophecy. The campers find out there is a spy among them who is reporting everything to Kronos, who took over Luke's body in the fourth book. Percy battles Kronos many times, and eventually becomes invincible from bathing in the River Styx.\nIn the beginning, Percy and Beckendorf, son of Hephaestus are sent on a quest to blow up Luke's demon cruise ship, and Beckendorf is killed.\nPercy and Nico sneak out of camp, and meet Hestia, who shows Percy part of Luke's past, and they meet Luke's mother.\nA war between the Titans and Olympians ensues, one that has been in the making for much of the series. In the end, Luke, who is also invincible from bathing in the River Styx, kills himself in order to send Kronos back to Tartarus. Silena Beuregard turns out to be the spy. She is a good person inside, but Luke threatens her, and they make a deal that Beckendorf will not be hurt, as she was Beckendorf's girlfriend. Silena dies trying to kill a drakon, disguised as Clarisse, which upsets Clarisse greatly.In the end of the book, Luke commits suicide to save the Olympians.\nAnnabeth admits she never loved Luke, and that she cared for him only as a brother. She and Percy finally cement their relationship. Percy tries to tell her about his feelings at the River Styx, but says that she is not making it easy. She says: \"I will never, ever make it easy for you Seaweed Brain. Get used to it\", then kisses him, after which the other campers throw them into the canoe lake. Percy then creates an air bubble and they share \"pretty much the best underwater kiss of all time.\".\nMovie.\nPercy was played by Logan Lerman in the movie \"Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief\". That movie was adapted from the first book in the series, \"The Lightning Thief\". A movie of the second book, \"The Sea of Monsters\" was released on August 7, 2013 in the United States.\nPowers/abilities.\nPercy, like most demigods, has two main disabilities:\nIn \"The Lightning Thief\", Percy is given a magically enchanted sword called Anaklusmos (Riptide). It is made of celestial bronze, a fictional metal which will injure immortals and monsters, but not wound mortals. Many demigods use celestial bronze weapons.\nChildren of the \"big three\" (Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades) are more powerful than demigods of the other Greek gods and goddesses. Hence, Percy has a wide range of abilities.\nAquatic (water) powers.\nPercy has a lot of powers specifically connected to the things controlled by of Poseidon: seas, horses, sea creatures, and earthquakes. His water-related abilities tend to be stronger in sea water than in fresh water."}

Apple first showed it on January 27 2010. It is larger than a smartphone and smaller than a laptop computer. It has a multiple touch interface (use two or more fingers to do certain things). It is different than a laptop in that it doesn't have a keyboard. Instead, it has a \"virtual keyboard\" using the touch screen, and a physical keyboard can be added. It doesn't have Adobe Flash. This keeps it from crashing, but some websites will not display correctly. Until iOS 9, also you cannot have multiple windows open at the same time and drag and drop things between them.\nHistory.\nApple made an early version of a tablet computer in 1993 called the Newton MessagePad. It had similar functions to the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad except it didn't have advanced things like the internet or a voice program. Apple stopped making Newtons in 1998.\nApple re-entered the mobile device market in 2007 when the iPhone was released. Some of the iPhone's features are based on the Newton.\nBy the end of 2009 rumors about the iPad had been around for several years, and on January 27, 2010 Steve Jobs announced the iPad. It was not the first tablet to be sold, but it was the first one to sell in large numbers. It also was the first one that was controlled almost entirely by fingers touching the screen. Many of the earlier tablets (and PDAs, or personal digital assistants) used a lot of buttons or a stylus to control the tablet.\nThe first generation iPad was able to be bought in the United States in April 2010 and most of the rest of the world within several months.\nLater models.\nApple announced the iPad 2 on March 2, 2011 and it was released on March 11, 2011. It had a new sleeker design and had a front and back video camera. It was also a lot thinner and had curved edges because people were complaining that the first gen iPad made their hands sore.\nOn March 16, 2012 Apple released the iPad 3. It kept the iPad 2's design but was slightly thicker and was the first iPad to have a retina screen for a sharper picture. It has 50% more pixels than a standard HDTV screen.\nOn November 2, 2012, Apple released the iPad 4 which featured an A6 processor, a new connector called Lightning which replaces the old 30 pin dock connector, and an updated FaceTime camera. They also released a new iPad called the iPad Mini which featured a 7.9 inch screen instead of the normal 9.7 inch screen, though it didn't have a retina display.\nOn October 22, 2013, the new iPad Air was announced which looked like the iPad Mini but still had the full size screen. It also had the newer A7 processor that the iPhone 5s had. At the same time, a new version of the iPad mini was announced that had the better Retina display.\nOn October 16, 2014, the iPad Air 2 was announced along with the iPad Mini 3. The iPad Air 2 has a thinner design than the iPad Air and has new features, such as a better camera and a Touch ID fingerprint reader. The iPad Mini 3 has the same design as the iPad Mini 2, but has a better camera and also has the Touch ID fingerprint reader that the iPad Air 2 has.\nOn September 9, 2015, Apple announced a new version of the iPad, the iPad Pro. It comes with either a 12.9 inch and a 9.7 inch screen and the A9X processor. Apple made a hardware keyboard that plugs into its side, and a stylus pen, the Apple Pencil, that can be used to draw on the screen as if it was a piece of paper.\nOn October 30, 2018, Apple announced the new update to their iPad Pro line. The update showcased the thinnest iPad ever, at 5.7mm thin, an improved processor, dubbed the A12x processor, a larger screen, and FaceID support. The screen uses Apple's all new liquid LED technology, first seen in the 2018 released iPhone XR. The new iPad Pro's also came with a slew of accessories, including a brand new Smart Keyboard, Apple Pencil, and multiple cases. Apple also changed the charging system from their long used Lighting connector, for a USB-C charger. Apple's new iPad Pro line come in two sizes.\nAll iPads, like most of Apple Inc's products, are made in China, and designed by Apple in California"}

Jackson in the movies ' and ' the film adaptations of the first and second books in the series, \"The Lightning Thief\" and The Sea of Monsters.\nBackground.\nGrover is the best friend of Percy Jackson. He is also a satyr, which means he has the upper body of a human and the legs of a goat. He has an empathy link with Percy. This means if one of them dies, the other will probably die, too (or that they will be left forever in a vegetative state, where they are asleep and never wake up).\nGrover gets afraid easily. When this happens, his eyes turn into slits like a goat's. He starts eating furniture and tin cans . He always tries to defend his friends. He is very loyal. Grover also can deal with dangerous situations well. An example would be when he was kidnapped by Polyphemus the Cyclops. He likes enchiladas. He is afraid of rabbits (which Thalia calls his \"bunny phobia\")\nGrover loves nature very much and hates pollution because he is a satyr. He secretly loves Artemis, the goddess of the hunt. He says, \"She's so...into nature.\" He also likes to be near the Hunters of Artemis. Grover's girlfriend is a nymph named Juniper. They are first seen together in \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\". He helps out animals. He can also talk to them. Grover likes to look for Pan, the god of the wild. He is also afraid of cyclopes.\nIn the books.\n\"The Lightning Thief\".\nGrover the satyr and a keeper, goes undercover at Yancy Academy as a disabled student in order to discover if there bloods who attend to kill crips because most half-bloods have AD-HD and dyslexia and can do special things. There he discovers Percy Jackson, a half-blood, and alerts Mr. Brunner the Latin teacher, who turns out to be Chiron, Camp Half-Blood's activities director. Grover reveals his satyr form to Percy when the Jacksons go to a beach house in Montauk, New York before they are attacked by a minotaur. He accompanies Percy along with Annabeth Chase, Athena's daughter, on a quest to the Underworld to retrieve Zeus's stolen Master Lightning Bolt. At the end of the book Grover gets his searchers license to go look for Pan, the god of the Wild.\n\"The Sea of Monsters\".\nIn The Sea of Monsters, Grover is searching for the lost god Pan, god of the Wild, when he is captured by Polyphemus the Cyclops. Grover is trapped in a bridal boutique, mistaken for a female Cyclops and is taken to Polyphemus's lair in the Sea of Monsters, where he creates the empathy link between him and Percy. In his dreams, Percy sees how Grover is trapped by Polyphemus, the blind cyclops that once held Odysseus captive, and is about to meet the same gruesome ending as all satyrs before him, including his father, who went searching for Pan. Along with Annabeth and Percy's half brother Tyson, Percy journeys on an unapproved quest to find Grover. At the end, the Golden Fleece (a powerful healing item) releases Thalia's spirit from the pine tree that kept it.\n\"The Titan's Curse\".\nGrover is undercover once again, this time at a military school, where he discovers two children, Nico and Bianca di Angelo, that he suspects are half-bloods. In the excitement of his discovery, Grover asks Percy to come and help him safely bring the half-bloods to camp half-blood. In the process of trying to get to the di Angelos, a manticore (Dr. Thorn) attempts kidnaps Percy, Bianca, and Nico, only to lose them to Thalia, Annabeth, and Grover. As they battle Dr. Thorn, the Hunters of Artemis step in and rid of the monster by making him trip off a cliff, which led to the loss of Annabeth, her being on Thorn's back. Artemis leaves her Hunters to be escorted to Camp Half-Blood by Percy, Grover, and Thalia. Artemis is then kidnapped, which means that a quest must be launched to save her. That quest consists of Grover, Bianca (who is a new Hunter of Artemis), Zoe Nightshade (The chief Hunter of Artemis), Thalia, and Percy, who journey across the country to Mt. Tampalais. On the way, Grover is involved in several situations where Pan, god of the Wild, speaks to him. The first was in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, where the presence of Pan made the birds on Grover's coffee cup and a rubber rat come to life, also bringing a giant wild boar to help Percy, Thalia, him, Bianca and Zoe escape the skeletal army. The second incident happened when Grover was alone. Pan spoke to him, saying, \"I await you.\" Both times, Grover was drinking coffee, so he and the other satyrs believe, that this had something to do with Pan's appearance.\n\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\".\nIt is in this book that we meet Juniper, Grover's nymph girlfriend, who is sobbing hysterically as The Council of Cloven Elders' decide that Grover has been searching far too long for the god Pan\u00a0\u2014 they give him a week to find Pan, and if he does not, his searcher's license will be revoked. He, Percy, Annabeth and Tyson head into the Labyrinth this time to find its creator, Daedalus, and his workshop. Sometime in the book, Grover and Tyson split up from Percy and Annabeth. However, Grover meets a monster. Later, Grover finds Pan and learns the truth about his disappearance and that he, the God of Wild Things, must fade away and leave the job of making the earth green again to Grover, Annabeth, Percy, Tyson and everyone else on the planet. Grover unleashes the cry of Panic, greatly disrupting the Battle, and distracting the enemy long enough for the campers to surge and eventually drive them back into the Labyrinth.\n\"The Last Olympian\".\nGrover has been missing for 2 months; Percy and Nico decide to look for him on their way to the Underworld. Percy locates Grover through his empathy link in Central Park and finds him under a giant elm tree. Percy wakes him up by yelling, (via empathy link) \"FOOD, PANCAKES!\". He tells them he just took a nap and they figure out that Morpheus, the god of dreams, put Grover to sleep. In that way, Grover gives Percy and Nico info that some minor gods are on Kronos' side. He helps Nico and Percy get into the Underworld by playing his reed pipes to open up an entrance in Central Park.\nAfter, his exile is ended and he is given a position in the Council of Cloven Elders. Grover is then appointed as the new Lord of the Wild, causing him to collapse with joy on the spot."}

There are also callosities (a series of horny growths) behind the blowhole, on the chin, above the eyes, on the lower lip, and on the rostrum (the beak-like upper jaw). \nDescription.\nRight whales are similar to bowhead whales, but smaller. These whales are rich in blubber and have 2 blowholes. The eyes are very small and lips are large. Right whales were named by whalers who considered them the \"right\" whales to hunt, since they were rich in blubber, they were easy to catch (they are relatively slow swimmers) and they floated after being killed. \nHistory.\nHunters needed the right whale's blubber for meat, because blubber could be boiled to make oil.\nThe right whale's name came from hunters, who thought that they were the \"right\" whales to hunt. This was because they had lots of blubber. They were also easy to catch (because they were relatively slow swimmers) and they floated on the surface of the water after being killed. Because of these things, right whales are the most endangered of the great whales."}

He is a demigod son of the Greek god Hermes.\nLuke is played by Jake Abel in the movies ', the film adaption of the first book, \"The Lightning Thief\" and ', the film adaption of the second book \"The Sea of Monsters\".\nCharacter background.\nLuke is first introduced in \"The Lightning Thief\" as the 19-year-old counselor for the Hermes cabin. He was born the year 1986. While the rest of Percy's cabin mates complain about him because he is undetermined, Luke tries to make him feel at home, even stealing a toiletry bag for him. Luke first came to Camp Half-Blood when he was 14, alongside Thalia Grace, daughter of Zeus, and Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena. Luke has a scar on his face, a relic from his battle with the dragon Ladon, guardian of the Garden of Hesperides, while on a quest. In \"The Last Olympian\", it is shown that his mother attempted to become the Oracle of Delphi and has succumbed to the curse of Hades. Her crazed prophetic ramblings affected Luke greatly, and forced him to run away when he was nine. In \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\", Luke's body becomes the vessel that harbors Kronos' essence.\nLuke dies in \"The Last Olympian\" when he is given Annabeth's knife by Percy. He sacrifices himself to defeat Kronos by stabbing himself under his left arm where his mortality was still kept intact after his bath in the River Styx (known as his Achilles heel). As he dies, he asks Percy to make sure all the demigods are claimed to avoid this happening again which might mean that they had become friends again because he is forgiven by Percy. Although he is seen as a villain throughout the series, in the end he is treated like a hero and forgiven by everyone. He is also the hero mentioned by the prophecy of the Oracle in \"The Last Olympian\"."}

Unlike other big characters in the series, none of her parents are gods. Instead, they both are mortal. Despite this, Rachel has the ability to see through Mist, a thing that makes most humans unaware of the Olympians and immortals. She has the power to predict things, which is not common even with demigods. Because of these powers, the Oracle of Delphi passes into her from the cursed remains of the previous oracle. She therefore becomes the next Oracle of Delphi, Oracle of the Gods as well as the resident oracle at Camp Half-Blood. By becoming the Oracle, she gives up her romance with Percy because the Oracle must be a maiden. \"Rats are delicious\"\nBackground.\n\"The Titan's Curse\".\nIn this book, Rachel first appears at the Hoover Dam (in which they have a dam problem). Percy is being chased by a group of Spartoi when she sneezes. Percy turns around and his sword, Riptide, goes through her body. He realizes she knows it is a sword. He also finds out that she can see through the Mist. She saves Percy from the Spartoi by sending him into a restroom behind her and the skeletons to the generator room, which makes electricity.\n\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\".\nIn \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\", more details on Rachel's life are given. She shows up at Percy's new school, Goode High School. She can see that two cheerleaders are really empousai and helps Percy escape from Kelli, one of the \"empousai\". Later, Percy asks her to help him navigate Daedalus's Labyrinth, a maze he built, to find him. She goes with Percy and Annabeth through the maze. After finding out Daedalus has made a deal with Kronos, she escapes with Percy and Annabeth. Eventually, the three find Kronos's headquarters. Kronos has started to live in Luke Castellan's body and tries to catch Percy. Rachel appears with Annabeth and Nico di Angelo and throws her blue plastic hairbrush at Luke's eye. This confuses Kronos and lets Percy escape. She also helps find Pan, the lost god of nature. She is there when he dies.\nLater, she leaves Percy, Annabeth, Nico, Grover Underwood, and Tyson. Before she does, she tells them that her father is a rich businessman who buys forests. He cuts them down and use them to build shopping malls. Pan's death affects her, mainly because of her father's job. She wants to hang out with Percy again. Annabeth is not happy about this. Percy promises to call her. He says that he has memorized her phone number. Rachel is happy about this. Percy thinks of inviting her to his birthday party. He is too afraid to do so.\nRachel and Percy become good friends in \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\". Annabeth becomes jealous of her. Rachel also sees that Percy and Annabeth like each other more than they will admit.\n\"The Last Olympian\".\n\"The Last Olympian\" begins with Percy driving her to the beach in Paul Blofis's Toyota Prius. She asks him to go with her and her parents on a vacation in St. Thomas, which he refuses nicely. They are interrupted by Percy's pegasus, Blackjack. He lands on the car with Charles Beckendorf riding him.\nPercy goes to sink the \"Princess Andromeda\", a ship which Kronos is using as his base. Rachel kisses him for good luck before he leaves. In Percy's dreams, he sees Rachel writing things in Ancient Greek. She is drawing pictures of things she has never seen before, like a picture of Luke Castellan at age nine. When she goes on vacation with her parents, she asks them to return to New York by making a deal with her father to go Clarion Academy. Clarion Academy is a finishing school (a girls' school that teaches culture and social things) for girls that her mother also went to. This was all because she felt that Percy was in danger. Later on, Rachel flies to Camp Half-Blood on Blackjack. She takes in the spirit of the Oracle because Hades lifts the curse he had put on it. She says the next Great Prophecy. Rachel then goes back to the mortal world for the school year, leaving the campers without their oracle until the next summer.\nPersonality.\nRachel's father is extremely wealthy, but she does not like the way her familly lives. She prefers helping charity. She also likes art, and sketched multiple realistic images of the past and future (sometimes things she never could have seen, like a 9-year-old Luke Castellan).\nRachel is a love interest for Percy, which created tension between her and Annabeth. However, she explains that she was attracted to Percy because he was the one who led her to her destiny as the Oracle. As the Oracle, she cannot fall in love or have children. She has respect for Annabeth and Percy's relationship."}

In the series, he is the demigod son of Hades and mortal Maria di Angelo. As such, Nico has extraordinary powers of necromancy and the power to command the dead; he is a son of one of the \"Big Three\" Greek gods, the other two being Hades' brothers Poseidon and Zeus. Nico is chronologically over eighty years old as a result of his prolonged stay in the Lotus Casino in Las Vegas, an enchanted hotel where one does not age and time does not pass at its normal pace. He was ten years old in the Titans Curse. He and his sister, Bianca Di Angelo, were placed in the Lotus Casino sometime around World War II and eventually taken out by a \u201clawyer\u201d (The Fury, Alecto) when Hades commanded. He also found his half-sister Hazel Levesque in the Underworld and took her back to Camp Jupiter as she was a child of Pluto. He is currently in a relationship with Will Solace.\nDescription.\nNico is said to have shaggy, messy black hair, olive skin (Although it has paled over time) and dark brown eyes. After his time in the maze, he is described as having a pale complexion. He usually wears dark clothing including black ripped jeans and is also mentioned on several occasions to be wearing an aviator's jacket. By the end of \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\", he also wears a skull ring, a gift from his deceased sister Bianca.\nIn \"The Titan's Curse\", Nico is a composed kid who loves a trading card game called Mythomagic. However, since his sister's death in \"The Titan's Curse\" at the hands of a defective Talos, he has a hateful resentment toward Percy. He later thinks Mythomagic is a stupid game, and burns all his cards in a fire. He becomes more sullen and solitary, saying that \"only the dead respect him... and only out of fear\". He believes that he will never be accepted with the living, but forgives Percy after Bianca tells him that it wasn't Percy's fault that she died. He also accepts the small figurine of Hades that Bianca wanted him to have before she died in \"The Titan's Curse\". In the fifth book, he brings Percy to his father to get information that proves to be the least his father can give, and his father ends up putting Percy in a dungeon. However, Nico rescues Percy from the dungeon and takes him to the River Styx where Percy becomes almost invincible. In the end of \"The Last Olympian\", Nico convinces his father, Hades, to help the other gods fight in the war against the Lord of Time, Kronos, and his army, and plays a major role in the victory. The relationship between Percy and Nico becomes close for they both might have been the child of the Great Prophecy.\nNico Di Angelo's fatal flaw is holding grudges, as Bianca tells him. In his case, it can lead to not wanting help or not asking to be saved in deadly situations because he does not like someone. Examples are his not wanting to be helped by Percy, even when Geryon was going to sell him to the Titans and not wanting to go back in the Labyrinth with them. Bianca shares this with him, as she also had the same fatal flaw in life, although this did not lead to her death. Bianca also says that holding grudges is the demigods of Hades' fatal flaw. In the fifth book, Nico tells his father, Hades, that he is holding a grudge that could end up killing the Olympians and the campers.\nIn \"The House of Hades\", Nico is forced by Cupid to reveal that he had had a crush on Percy Jackson. This reveals that he is homosexual. In The Blood of Olympus, he later says that he does not feel that way anymore about Percy and that he had been young and impressionable at the time, (by saying Percy is: \"not his type) and is seen to be potentially crushing on Will Solace (head counselor of the Apollo cabin).\nIn The Trials of Apollo: The Hidden Oracle, Nico is in a romantic relationship with Will and receives the enthusiastic support of Apollo (Will's father) for their relationship.\nIn the books.\n\"The Titan's Curse\".\nNico is ten years old and first appears with his sister, Bianca, in a military school called Westover Hall in Bar Harbor, Maine. They are sought out by Grover Underwood, the satyr, who believes them to be two very powerful unknown half-bloods. Nico seems to be very interested in Mythomagic, a game about Greek mythology. When his sister Bianca accepts Artemis's proposal to become a Hunter, Nico gets angry at her for \"abandoning\" him. Percy finds Nico eavesdropping on Bianca and Z\u00f6e Nightshade (one of the Hunters of Artemis, a daughter of Atlas), and Nico makes Percy to promise to keep his sister safe. He does not appear again until the end of the book, where Percy explains to him that Bianca died to save the others on the quest. Nico creates a large crack in the ground to swallow up the skeletons that were chasing Percy. The he immediately turns on Percy, telling him he hates him, and reminds him of the oath he took to keep Bianca safe. Nico is last seen running into the woods at night, after screaming at Percy.\n\"The Battle of The Labyrinth\".\nNico is supposedly eleven years old in this book. He is first seen talking with an unknown ghost who is trying to tell Nico how to trade his sister's soul for another soul, when Percy is sent a collect Iris Message sent by Bianca Di Angelo, Nico's sister. It is revealed in this book that Nico can summon the dead. Nico is then seen when Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson visit Triple G Ranch, where Percy then saves Nico from being sent to the Titans. Nico, still angry at Percy, finally understands that it was Bianca's choice to go into the Talos robot, and that he shouldn't be mad at Percy. The others leave Nico at the Ranch, where he supposedly meets King Minos (in ghost form) again, who convinces him to go back into the Labyrinth to supposedly save Percy and the others.\nHe is next seen being dragged into Daedalus' workshop by one empousa and two Laistrygonians, in chains, after being tricked by King Minos. He escapes with Percy, Annabeth, and Rachel Elizabeth Dare, who have to go back into the Labyrinth to find Grover and Tyson, who had stayed behind to look for Pan, god of the Wild. Along the way, they see Kronos in the form of Luke, and Nico, in a desperate attempt to save everyone, shows his true powers, and makes it known to Kronos that he is a son of Hades. They meet the wild god Pan, who gives everyone except for Nico a cryptic future reading and then vanishes. After they get out of the Labyrinth, a full-fledged battle erupts between the Titans and Camp Half-Blood, in which Nico summons a dozen undead soldiers to fight the dracanae, passing out in the process. He is revived with nectar and ambrosia, and he states that summoning that many soldiers required a lot of energy. After the campfire, he is seen talking with the ghost of his sister Bianca. He then tells Percy, who came out to see what was going on, that he did not belong at camp, but instead in the Underworld; he would train there instead. He also goes to search for his mother. He is last seen on Percy's apartment fire escape giving Percy news on Daedalus and a way to beat Luke for good. Before mentioning it, Nico is distracted by Percy's blue birthday cake, and Percy invites him in to talk.\n\"The Last Olympian\".\nNico is twelve years old in this book. His theory to gain an edge over the Titans is to make Percy invincible by having him bathe in the River Styx, similar to the myth of Achilles. It is shown that after Bianca died, Hades feels he has no competent child, repeatedly mentioning that Bianca could do a better job at fulfilling their father's demands than Nico. It is also revealed that the lawyer who removed the children from the Lotus Casino was Hades' lead Fury, Alecto, in disguise.\n\"The Last Olympian\".\nNico is in about the quarter of the way in the book, he brings Percy Jackson to May Castellan's house, and Hades palace to talk with Hades but instead to Percy Jackson gets put in the dungeon and rescued by Nico. He fights but comes a little late to help with the Kronos war, at the end of the book he talks about Rachel Elizabeth Dare being missing.\n\"The Son of Neptune\".\nNico appears in the beginning of the book, He is visiting his half-sister Hazel, who was showing Percy (after losing his memory) Camp Jupiter at the time. Nico lies to Percy about knowing him after he finds out that Percy's memories have been stolen and simply says that he's an ambassador for Pluto at the Roman camp. It is later made clear that this was to preserve diplomacy (since Greeks and Romans didn't get along) and not interfere with Hera's plans - rather than a malicious urge.\n\"The Mark of Athena\".\nThough Nico was inside of a bronze jar (after getting captured) during most of The Mark of Athena, he does get rescued by Piper, Jason and Percy. Nico also explains to the others where and the doors of death are and how to close them. When Percy and Annabeth are holding on for dear life at the edge of a chasm that lead to Tartarus, Nico desperately tries and fails to save them before they fall into Tartarus, promising he would lead the others to the other side of the doors of death.\nThe Hidden Oracle\nHe doesn't do much just talking, not much action with him in this book.\n\"The House of Hades\".\nNico admits his feelings for Percy when he is confronted by Cupid. This makes Nico the first demigod acknowledged as gay in the series. He indirectly shares this secret with Jason, who is with him at the time, and then is obliged to explain. Nico appears to trust Jason in this scene, even if only grudgingly. Afterwards, Nico offers to shadow travel the Athena Parthenos in an attempt to bring the Roman and Greek camps together. He is accompanied by Praetor Reyna and the satyr Coach Hedge.\n\"The Blood of Olympus\".\nNico helps transport the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-blood to halt the attack from the Camp Jupiter. He is joined by Reyna and Coach Hedge. The trio shadow travel halfway around the world, causing Nico to lose a lot of his strength and start to \"fade\". When facing Bryce Lawrence, it was demonstrated that Nico could turn people into ghostly specters with enough effort.\nHades was also alluded to have been aware about Nico's romantic feelings for Percy during one of his conversations with his son. Hades gives Nico his blessing and tells him he'll prepare a room for Nico in the Underworld for if his mission should fail. He also informs Nico that he wants him to be happy, and that he is proud of his son.\nUpon landing at Camp Half-Blood with Reyna and Coach Hedge he leaves them to destroy the onagers, where he finds Will Solace, Lou Ellen and Cecil. Will Solace and Nico start bickering, which amuses Lou Ellen and Cecil. \nLater on, it is shown that Nico has not visited the infirmary or spoken to Will since the battle, and Will expresses his dismay at this, saying that Nico could at least have dropped by and Will would have been glad to see a friendly face. This surprises Nico, who hadn't realized Will might want to see him, and says that his face is usually not welcome, especially around the wounded/sick. Will is upset by this and protests, stating that people were always trying to befriend Nico, it was simply that Nico would not allow them to. \nSome time later, when Nico answers the door to his cabin and sees Jason Grace, he momentarily mistakes him for Will, feeling disappointed when he realizes his mistake. He then feels annoyed with himself at being disappointed, and it is implied that he is interested in Will Solace.\nAfter a conversation later on in which Will orders Nico to stay at the infirmary for three days of rest, Nico sees Percy and Annabeth and decides to clear the air between them, since they will be seeing a lot of each other in the next few years. He confesses his old feelings for Percy, while Annabeth looks on, smiling reassuringly and even offering him a high-five for managing both to say the words and to utterly astound Percy, who was oblivious of his feelings (at the time they existed). He says that Percy is not his type, and he was simply young, confused, lonely and scared with no one else to turn to or trust at the time. (Percy is confused, even disappointed saying \"What do you mean i'm not your type?\". After he walks towards a waving Will Solace, the boy he chooses. In Trials of Apollo we get a glimpse of their relationship. It is the first Homosexual couple in Rick's books with the ship name \u2018Solangelo\u2019.\nPowers and abilities.\nGeneral.\nNico's sword is made of Stygian Iron, which will kill monsters, and, unlike the other metals of Celestial Bronze and Imperial Gold, is capable of harming mortals. The metal, when being forged, is cooled in the River Styx, making it indestructible. It is implied that only beings of the Underworld, such as Hades and his children, are able to use a Stygian iron weapon. The sword helps him channel his power to control and summon the dead, along with draining an enemy's soul to reinforce his sword's power. He can also use it to create fissures in the ground, trapping anyone unlucky in the underworld. This is like what he did to king Minos. Nico being an incredibly powerful demigod; he has many powers and is aware that \u201cWith great power... comes a great need to take a nap,\" as he says after putting to sleep all of the skeleton guards in the Palace of Hades during his and Percy's escape from imprisonment during the Last Olympian.

She is the demigod daughter of Zeus and Beryl Grace, a famous mortal actress. Thalia has angel-blue eyes ( thought done say she has stormy green), black long hair, and a spray of freckles and a brilliant singing voice.\nBackground.\nThalia Grace is the daughter of Zeus, one of the \"Big Three\" Greek Gods, the other two being Poseidon and Hades. Grover Underwood was meant to watch over her when she ran away from home at ten years old, reaching Camp Half-Blood two years later. On her journey, she met Annabeth Chase and Luke Castellan. They had brief encounters with the Hunters of Artemis, and were almost convinced to join, but got angry with Zoe Nightshade and did not join. When she was twelve, they were all attacked by a herd of monsters and caught by a Cyclops in New York. She was captured, but thanks to Annabeth, freed. They ran, but the monsters they had briefly escaped from caught up to them. As they reached Half-Blood Hill, Thalia sent Luke, Grover, and Annabeth over the boundary line while she faced the monsters. She sacrificed her life for her friends, but her father Zeus took pity on her and turned her into a pine tree to preserve her, keeping the rest of the camp safe.\nThalia is a very skilled fighter and as she stated in \"The Titan's Curse\"; she can always beat Luke in a battle (which Percy has only done once). It is also mentioned throughout the series that she has a punk sort of style, hates Barbie dolls, and likes Green Day. She is always listening to rock bands and is into the punk subculture. Annabeth compares her to Percy, telling him, \"You guys are so alike it's scary. Either you would have been best friends, or you would have strangled each other.\"\nThalia wants to be strong as many people believe, but sometimes is very sensitive. She loves Chiron as a father and believes that her father does not care about her. She deeply respects Poseidon but does not know why. Her favorite god is Pan. She is also known to like cheeseburgers, mentioned twice in the series. She also appears reluctant to use her mother's surname.\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians.\n\"The Lightning Thief\".\nIt is mentioned that Thalia was turned into a pine tree when she risked her life saving her friends atop of Half-Blood Hill, which guarded the boundary line for Camp Half-Blood. She also appeared in Percy's dream. This is one of the first movies that came from the series, in fact it is the first movie. However, she was mentioned a few times, no one in the beginning really knew why. \n\"The Sea of Monsters\".\nThalia appears in Percy's dreams throughout the book. At the end of \"The Sea of Monsters\", she is brought back to life by the Golden Fleece which Clarisse places on her pine tree. Zeus gives her a spear which shoots electricity and turns into a small mace canister that fits in her pocket, and Athena gives her a bracelet that turns into Aegis, a shield with the Medusa's head carved into it. It is a replica of her father\u2019s. Thalia is now potentially the child of the prophecy, and Kronos soon takes advantage of the fact. in the sea of monsters Percy uses the sea as a compass to navigate to find the golden sheet which will bring back Thalia as her tree was dying in front of the camp\n\"The Titan's Curse\".\nThalia and Percy quarrel occasionally at camp because their similar personalities tend to clash. Thalia is called \"Pinecone Face\" by Percy; in retaliation, she calls him \"Seaweed Brain\", which Percy does not like because it's Annabeth's pet name for him. Thalia goes on the quest to find Artemis, hunt down the dangerous Ophiotaurus Artemis was seeking, and rescue Annabeth, along with Percy, Zo\u00eb Nightshade, Bianca di Angelo, and Grover. Thalia, Percy, Zoe, Bianca, and Grover come upon the Junkyard of the Gods and told not to take anything from the junkyard, and just as the group is about to leave, a metal giant rises because Bianca took a figurine of her father, Hades, for Nico. Bianca goes inside of the metal giant and tries to control it, causing the giant to fall over and Bianca to die. Together, they face the Titan General, Atlas's army, and make it to Mount Tamalpais. Already weakened by dragon poison, while facing her father, Atlas, Zoe dies from a final blow from Atlas. There, Thalia fights her old friend Luke, and it seems that she has strong feelings for him, and they discover that Kronos used Thalia to twist destiny into her hands, since she would be turning sixteen on the day following the Winter Solstice. She escaped this deadly path and turned to her half-sister, Artemis, who made her a Hunter, which would stop her from being sixteen, because whoever becomes a Hunter becomes immortal, unless they shall die in battle, or break the oath by falling in love.\nThalia's tree still remains standing on Half-Blood Hill with the Golden Fleece for energy, and is currently being guarded by a baby dragon called Peleus.\n\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\".\nThalia is absent from Camp Half-Blood this summer due to her adventures with Artemis and the Hunters, but she is mentioned once by Percy when talking to Hera, the goddess of marriage, about Zeus and Ms. Grace's past relationship.\n\"The Last Olympian\".\nThalia and the Hunters of Artemis show up when Percy is looking for someone to defend the Lincoln Tunnel against the Titans. Thalia helps Percy and the other demigods defend Manhattan. At the end of the story, Thalia is still alive, and is granted help in getting more Hunters, because a lot of the Hunters died.\nThe Heroes of Olympus.\n\"The Lost Hero\".\nThalia shows up at the cave by Aeolus' palace, along with the other hunters. She also fights at the wolf house when the hunters help Leo, Jason, and Piper fight the monsters and the giant.\nThe Son of Neptune.\nThere are two parts in which she is either mentioned or appeared. First, in Percy's dream which was a flashback of him in \"The Titan's Curse\", Thalia, Percy and Zo\u00eb Nightshade battling on Mt. Tam going against Atlas, Luke, and trying to save Annabeth and Artemis. Percy later sees Zo\u00eb dying and rise to the stars. Second, though Thalia was never mentioned, when Hylla, the Queen of the Amazons, talks to Hazel Levesque she mentions a group of archers that travel around who follow the goddess Artemis, which refers to the Hunters.\nThe Blood of Olympus.\nThalia and the hunters abducted Reyna Avila Ram\u00edrez-Arellano in San Juan and took her to her sister Hylla Ram\u00edrez-Arellano. She explained that the hunters and Amazons have been fighting monsters while the demigods have been fighting each other. Orion then attacked their stronghold, killing many Hunters and Amazons though Thalia and Hylla manage to survive. When Nico and Hedge appear, she protects them while they and Reyna shadow travel away. She survives the battle.\nThe Trials of Apollo.\nThe Dark Prophecy.\nThalia and the hunters were close by when Apollo signaled for back up. They arrived with Leo and Festus to aid in the rescue operation and she decided to rode on Livia with Apollo, so she could help them to escape. After they fled, the lieutenant of Artemis offered the fallen god Moonwater to regain his strength. Then she finally says Artemis was forbidden by Zeus from interfering with Apollo but still ordered the Hunters to help him. They three then head back to the Waystation.\nShe and Apollo ride Livia in to the Waystation and she goes to stop her hunters from possibly killing Lityerses. After they rally everyone for battle she requests more arrows from Emmie.\nHalfway through the battle, she along with Lit, Calypso and Josephine stood by as Commodus had Emmie, Leo and Georgie hostage. Apollo asks her to stand down before he goes not his Divine Form and blinds the emperor. She takes out one of his guards and searched the surrounding area for Commodus with no results. After that, she sits with everybody and discuss about the prophecy revealed by Meg, saying that the Hunters can't help because they just have one mission to finish.\nBefore she and the Hunters leave, she asks Apollo to say hello to Jason and Piper. In return, the god asks her to say hi to Artemis for him, which she agrees to do.\nFatal flaw.\nIt is implied that she has a weak resistance when she is offered power. She is also afraid of heights, a quality Percy finds strange, as her father is the Lord of the Sky. She is also extremely determined, as revealed in the short story \"The Sword of Hades\" in \"The Demigod Files\". She has trouble abandoning a difficult task that she has started but is not able to complete."}

It was written by Rick Riordan and was published in 2007. \"The Titan's Curse\" is the third novel in the \"Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians\" series. It is the next book after \"The Sea of Monsters\". The book tells the story of the adventures of the fourteen-year-old demigod Percy Jackson as he and his friends go on a dangerous adventure. In this quest, they have to rescue his friend Annabeth and the Greek goddess Artemis, who have both been kidnapped.\n\"The Titan's Curse\" received good reviews. It was nominated for many awards. The book was also the number one \"The New York Times\" children's series best seller and \"Book Sense\" Top Ten Summer Pick for 2007. It was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on May 1, 2007. The novel was also released in audiobook format. Actor Jesse Bernstein read the audiobook. It is followed by \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\", which is the fourth book in the series.\nPlot.\nLike the other books in the series, \"The Titan's Curse\" is of the fantasy genre. It uses the ancient Greek mythology in a modern setting as background. Reviewers have called its plot \"fast-paced\", meaning that the story moves very quickly. It has humor as well as themes such as love and loyalty.\nPlot summary.\nAnnabeth Chase and Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, are kidnapped and Percy and his friends must find Artemis before the winter solstice. This is because at the winter solstice, her influence on the Olympian Council could change an important vote. The vote was on the war with the Titans. Thalia Grace, Zo\u00eb Nightshade, Bianca Di Angelo, and Grover go on this dangerous quest. They also are searching for a rare monster that Artemis was trying to hunt down when she went missing. This monster is so powerful that it can destroy Olympus. Percy is called by a hippocampus (which is a mythological sea-horse) to rescue a cow-like creature called the Ophiotaurus which lives in the sea. Percy names the Ophiotaurus \"Bessie\". He did not know that it is a male.\nWith help from Apollo, they reach a small town in New Mexico. Grover feels the presence of Pan, the Greek god of nature. Soon, a wild gift from Pan, the giant Erymanthian Boar, comes to carry them to San Francisco. It takes them to the junkyard of the gods. Here, Percy meets Ares and talks to Aphrodite. Aphrodite hints that Annabeth and Percy will fall in love in future. The group then enters the junkyard. There, Bianca tries to steal an action figure for her younger brother. However, she awakens a prototype of Talos, a giant man of bronze. She destroys it, but dies after this. The demigods then go to Hoover Dam. Percy is attacked by skeleton warriors there. He meets Rachel Elizabeth Dare, a girl who can see through the Mist (which prevents common people from seeing monsters and magical things). She saves Percy by confusing the skeletons. This allows Percy and his friends to escape.\nIn San Francisco, they learn that Bessie the Ophiotaurus is the monster Artemis was searching. This is because sacrificing it and burning its entrails will give a person the power to destroy Olympus. They ask for the help of Annabeth's father who gives them a car. They travel to the Garden of Hesperides, where Zo\u00eb meets her sisters. She is poisoned by a dragon called Ladon. They continue to the Mountain of Despair on California's Mount Tamalpais, where Mt. Othrys, the Titan capital, is now present. From the top of the mountain where Atlas held up the sky, they see Artemis holding the sky. Annabeth is held captive by Luke. Percy takes the burden\u2014the Titan's curse\u2014from Artemis. After this, a fight breaks out. Atlas (the General of the Titans) kills his daughter Zo\u00eb by throwing her against rocks. Artemis tricks Atlas into taking his burden from Percy. Luke falls from a cliff during a battle with Thalia, and Percy thinks that he is dead. They go to Olympus and they keep Ophiotaurus there and at that party Percy is told by Annabeth that Luke has survived.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Titan's Curse\" received positive reviews from critics. The reviewers praised the humor and action in the story. \"Children's Literature\" called the book fast-paced. They said it \"is full of adventure and humour\" and that \"[r]eaders will relate to good natured Percy, the protagonist.\" \"Kirkus\" said that the book made Greek myths come alive in a way classrooms cannot. They said the book will have \"readers wondering how literature can be this fun.\" \"School Library Journal\" wrote that \"Intricate prophecies and relationships\" are \"neatly\" woven into the plot which they said had a lot of adventure. They added: \"Teachers will cheer for Percy Jackson and the Olympians\" as they would help students to learn about Greek mythology and also to read. They said that the book was a \"winner\" in \"Olympic\" (large) proportions. \"Booklist's\" starred review said, \"The Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians series is built around a terrific idea\" and said Riordan added more depth to the characters, but the books are still as funny as the previous ones. \"KidsReads\" also praised the book and said that the books are popular because they combine \"humor, adventure and a winning hero\" and said readers who have read the previous books would like Riordan's style.\nAwards and nominations.\n\"The Titan's Curse\" received some awards and nominations.

Additional contents include interviews with some of the campers, a picture of Annabeth's trunk, a map of Camp Half-Blood, and various crossword puzzles and other activities. It is set between the fourth book, \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\", and the fifth book, \"The Last Olympian\".\nStories.\n\"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot\".\nClarisse La Rue is given the chore of taking care of Ares's war chariot. It is stolen by her immortal brothers as a prank, Deimos and Phobos (gods of terror and fear respectively). Percy and Clarisse find it at a zoo. They face the two gods, whom without their powers of fear and terror are extremely weak in battle, (unlike the nature of Ares), and are easily defeated. They bring the chariot to Ares' Temple on the Intrepid, a battle cruiser.\n\"Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon\".\nPercy Jackson and Charles Beckendorf are on the same team for capture the flag. Beckendorf, a son of Hephaestus, has a somewhat awkward conversation about girls, and thinks Percy should ask Annabeth to the Fourth of July fireworks, the biggest dating event of the summer at Camp Half-Blood, that night. They set off into the woods and stumble on a huge anthill. Silena Beauregard and Annabeth capture Percy. Meanwhile, Charles Beckendorf charges straight ahead into the ant swarm as he tries to take back a huge bronze dragon's head, but immediately is pinched in the leg and has acid spit on his face. Percy, Annabeth and Silena try to find the rest of the body of the bronze dragon which was once one of the camp's defenses against monsters before Thalia's Pine Tree took its place so it can rescue Beckendorf from the ants. They finally get the monster started (a bronze dragon with no wings) and get it to help Beckendorf. It blasts open the ants' nest and all the ants attack the dragon. Meanwhile, Percy, Annabeth and Silena dart into the ant hill and get Beckendorf back out. When they come out and flee, the dragon spots them and goes berserk. Percy distracts the dragon so Beckendorf can jump on the dragon's back and unplug him. Silena is so relieved that Beckendorf is alive that when he asks her to the fireworks, she gladly accepts the invitation. Once they get back to camp, it turns out the capture the flag game has not ended yet, and Annabeth puts them in jail. Percy and Charles protest to no avail. Before Annabeth leaves to go back to the front line to fight for her team, she asks Percy out to the Fourth of July Fireworks, but she quickly leaves before Percy can answer.\n\"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades\".\nRick Riordan wrote this short story for World Book Day 2009. It takes place between \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\" and \"The Last Olympian\".\nPersephone calls Percy, Thalia and Nico, all the children of the Big Three, into the Underworld to retrieve Hades's new sword from a demigod spy who stole it. The problem is that Hades' keys, which let anyone out of or into the Underworld, are in it. Persephone gives them a flower to track the half-blood. When all of the petals fall off, the sword thief has made it out of the Underworld. Percy, Nico and Thalia must retrieve the sword before time runs out. They catch the thief, Ethan Nakamura, but all the petals fall off because Ethan has raised the Titan Iapetus. Percy flings Iapetus into the river Lethe, a river that makes one forget their identity, during a fight. Although Percy also falls in, he stays dry because of his powers, being the son of Poseidon. Percy tells Iapetus that he is Bob and Iapetus believes him and is now harmless. When they return to Hades and Persephone with the sword, Hades is very unhappy about the sword and leaves in anger, threatening Persephone never to disobey him again. They later find out that Persephone requested the sword against Hades's orders.\nAudiobook.\nAn audiobook read by actor Jesse Bernstein was released the same day as the book.\nCritical reception.\nThe book received mixed reviews. Publishers Weekly criticized, \"Bland illustrations depicting the contents of Annabeth's trunk, a map of Camp Half-Blood and a short \"sneak peek\" at \"The Last Olympian\" pad the contents (barely) to book length; the inclusion of a crossword puzzle and a word search makes the book difficult to share. Not a must-read-but try telling that to rabid fans.\" School Library Journal reviewer Tim Wadham commended the writing, saying, \"Despite the fact that this is more of a marketing package than anything else, the quality of and interest in the three stories likely justifies its purchase.\""}

It is the fifth and final installment in the \"Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians\" series and serves as the direct sequel to \"The Battle of the Labyrinth\". There is a statement at the end of the book referencing the close of \"the first Camp Half-Blood series,\" indicating that there might be more to follow. \"The Last Olympian\" revolves around the demigod Perseus Jackson as he leads his friends in a last stand to protect Mount Olympus. The book received many positive reviews.\nSynopsis.\nPlot summary.\nPercy Jackson, his friends, and the Olympians fight in a war resembling the original war between the Greek gods and the Titans and in a final battle with the powerful Titan, Kronos. Many fight for Olympus, including the Hunters of Artemis, dryads, satyrs, naiads, and tree nymphs, Chiron's centaur cousins the Party Ponies, and the hellhound Mrs. O'Leary. They must defend Mt. Olympus from Kronos' huge army consisting of rogue half-bloods, dracaena, Hyperboreans, Laestrygonians, drakon, Hyperion, telekhines, Typhon, and hellhounds.\nIt is revealed that Luke had bathed in the River Styx, thus becoming nearly invincible (much like Achilles). Seeking to defeat Kronos, Percy does the same, with some encouragement from Nico. It is also revealed how Nico's mother died, and that the Oracle's foretelling of her death led to Hades cursing the Oracle. Due to this, when Luke's mother attempts to become the Oracle, she loses her mind and is given glimpses of Luke's future. Rachel, a mortal who can see through the Mist, tells Percy that he is not the hero of the Great Prophecy and that it will influence his choice when he turns 16. \nPercy and Luke (who is possessed by Kronos) battle at the top of Mount Olympus in the throne room. Luke is shocked back into his normal self when Annabeth reminds him of his promise that he would never harm her. The 'cursed blade' of the prophecy was the knife that Luke gave to Annabeth when he promises her that they are family. The Great Prophecy hinges on Percy's decision to give Luke the dagger rather than kill him. Luke commits suicide by stabbing himself in his mortal point when Kronos takes over his body, becoming the hero of the prophecy and ending the war on Percy's 16th birthday. \nThe gods grant Percy, Grover, Annabeth, and Tyson rewards at the conclusion of their quest. Tyson becomes the General of the Cyclops army and is gifted a new weapon, a \"stick.\" Grover is granted a place on the Council of Cloven Elders and becomes a new Lord of the Wild. Annabeth's wish to become an architect is fulfilled as she is tasked to design and rebuild Olympus. Percy, refusing godhood for himself, forces the gods to swear on the River Styx that they will recognize all of their children by the time they turn 13 and that they will end the pact of the Big Three, in which Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades were barred from fathering demigod offspring. He also requires cabins for Hades and the minor gods to be built at Camp Half-Blood, and that they set Calypso free of her curse. Rachel becomes the new Oracle of Delphi and speaks the next Great Prophecy. Percy and Annabeth share a kiss, after which Clarisse La Rue and their other surviving friends dunk them in the lake, where they share another kiss, this time underwater.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Last Olympian\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote \"...fans will not be disappointed\" and remarked \"As the capstone to this beloved series, this story satisfies.\" They praised Percy's \"brave leadership\" and said that \"the final clash would keep a Hollywood special effects team busy for years.\" \"Booklist\"'s starred review commented that \"...Riordan\u2019s imagination soars in the climactic battle scenes\" but said that he manages to \"bring the whole series to a satisfying close in the down-to-earth conclusion.\" It also received starred reviews from \"Kirkus\".\nAudiobooks.\nThe unabridged audiobook version of \"The Last Olympian\" is read by Jesse Bernstein. It was released on May 12, 2009, by Random House/Listening Library. It is 10 hours and 50 minutes long."}

He is a cyclops. Percy Jackson, the main character of the series, is his half-brother. They have the same father, the Greek god Poseidon. He first appears as a homeless boy in the second book of the series, \"The Sea of Monsters the second book\"\nTyson is played by Douglas Smith in , the film adaption of The Sea of Monsters.\nBackground.\nTyson is the son of the Greek god of the sea Poseidon and a nature spirit. He is a young cyclops who tries to be \"the best little brother possible\" and \"make his family proud.\" He meets Percy at Meriwether College Prep school; Tyson is the subject of a program at the school which seeks to take in a homeless kid and help him while also taking in some information about him. The Mist obscures everybody's view of Tyson's one eye, making most think he has two eyes . Tyson has severe scars on his back that were caused by a sphinx in the substation where he used to live. Tyson finds Annabeth Chase pretty. He uses his bare strength and metalworking ability to his avail in many situations. For example, while fighting different monsters in \"The Sea of Monsters\", his immunity to fire protected him from magical flaming spheres that would have killed anbody else that stepped in it's path of fire. During his first summer at Camp-Half Blood, Tyson makes Percy a shield with depictions of all their adventures engraved on it; it retracts into a watch when not deployed.\nIn the books.\n\"The Sea of Monsters\".\nThalia's tree, the tree which serves as the magical border of Camp Half-Blood, is mysteriously poisoned. Chiron is blamed for poisoning the tree and dismissed from camp; Tantalus takes his job. The only thing able to cure the tree is the Golden Fleece, which has healing powers for plants, animals, and humans. It is located on Polyphemus's Island in the Sea of Monsters (the Bermuda Triangle).\nClarisse La Rue, the daughter of Ares and longtime enemy of Percy, is given the quest to go into the Sea of Monsters to find the Golden Fleece. Percy and Annabeth decide to go also, not just for the Golden Fleece, but for their friend Grover, who is trapped in Polyphemus's cave. Tyson, Percy, and Annabeth, after saving Camp Half-Blood from two fire-breathing bulls, set out to find Polyphemus, who believes that Grover is a female cyclops and not a satyr.\nAs they enter the Sea of Monsters, they have to get past Scylla and Charybdis. Instead of trying to sail in between, Clarisse goes for Charybidis. Clarisse's ship is destroyed. Tyson, who did not escape the ship in time, is presumed dead the until it is learned that he was saved by a hippocampus named Rainbow. They all meet up on Polyphemus's Island and ultimately leave with the Golden Fleece.\nWhen they return to the mortal world, Clarisse returns to camp on a plane. Percy, Annabeth and Tyson are kidnapped by Luke. He almost kills Percy in a duel, but Percy reveals that Chiron is innocent. Chiron comes to rescue them with his strangely dressed relatives, the Party Ponies. When they return to camp, the Fleece is put on the tree, reviving both it and Thalia.\n\"The Titan's Curse\".\nTyson plays a minor role in \"The Titan's Curse\". Once, while he is in Poseidon's underwater court making various items at the forge, he appears in an Iris message between him and Percy, where he explains that he is going back to camp.\n\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\".\nPercy comes back to Camp Half-Blood to find Tyson already there cleaning their room for inspection. Tyson has also fixed Percy's shield, which has been broken by a manticore, Dr. Thorn in the third book. The shield retracts into a watch when not in use.\nAnnabeth leads the quest into Daedalus' Labyrinth. She breaks the rule of having only two companions on a quest by choosing Percy, Grover, and Tyson. Annabeth descends into the Labyrinth with them to find a way to stop Kronos's evil forces from entering the borders of Camp Half-Blood by searching for its inventor, Daedalus. They run into many obstacles. Annabeth faces a Sphinx and finds the riddles (which are actually factual questions) not challenging and an insult to her intellect. They escape the claws of the Sphinx and continue on to find Hephaestus so he can tell them about where to find Daedalus. Tyson then finds Briares, the Hundred-Handed One, but is disappointed to find out he is afraid of Kampe and refuses to fight. They split up, and Tyson follows Grover, who goes a different direction in search of Pan. They all reunite and flee the Labyrinth after the help of Daedalus (Quintus).\n\"The Last Olympian\".\nAfter jumping off the exploding \"Princess Andromeda\" (a cruise ship that Kronos had made his headquarters), Percy finds himself in Poseidon's palace where Tyson is waiting for him. Percy is in a grim state, so Tyson takes him to Poseidon. Poseidon looks very aged due to all of the stress from the war going on. Poseidon is not letting Tyson fight, for fear of losing him. To Tyson's disappointment, he sends him back to the armory to make weapons. The next time he is seen is through the mist of the hearth on Mount Olympus. Percy gives Poseidon the idea to send Tyson and all the other Cyclopes to take down Typhon. They do, and Typhon lands in the Hudson River. Tyson is last seen on Mount Olympus where he is awarded a new \"stick\"; he is also given the role of general of Olympus' army."}

He won the 2009 World Chess Cup. In 1998, Gelfand emigrated to Israel, where he is their top ranking chess player.\nChess career.\nGelfand was Junior Champion of the Soviet Union at 17, and European Junior Champion two years later. In 1988 he tied for first in the World Junior Championship, the title going to Joel Lautier. He earned the GM title the following year. He has won about 30 tournaments in his career, including tournaments at Wijk aan Zee (in 1992 and 1994) and first places in Biel (1993), Dos Hermanas (1994), Belgrade (1995), Tilburg (1996), Malmo (1999) and Pamplona (2004).\nWorld Championship Candidate.\nGelfand has several times qualified for Candidates tournaments for the World Chess Championship. In 1993, he qualified for the Candidates via the Interzonal, and was knocked out in the quarter-final by England's Nigel Short. In the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996 he won the Interzonal, then won his first two Candidates matches, before being eliminated in the semi-final by Anatoly Karpov. He had numerous strong results in the knockout tournaments for the FIDE Championships 1998\u20132004, with his best result being a semi-finalist in 1997. He played in the 8-player 2002 Dortmund Tournament, which was the Candidates for the Classical World Chess Championship 2004, but failed to reach the semi-finals. \nHe qualified for the tournament for the World Chess Championship 2007, and surprised most observers by finishing joint second with reigning world champion Vladimir Kramnik (third after tie breaks). The tournament and the world championship was won by Viswanathan Anand. \nGelfand won the Chess World Cup 2009, and was automatically seeded into the Candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012.\nThe 2012 Candidates match series was held in Kazan, Russia. In game three of the quarterfinals he played the Sicilian defense to defeat Shakhriyar Mamedyarov 2.5\u20131.5. In the semifinals he faced American Gata Kamsky. After splitting the first four games 2\u20132, the match went into a rapid playoff. Kamsky won game three in the playoff to go ahead 2\u20131. This meant Gelfand had to win with black in the final game to avoid elimination. Gelfand was up to the task, and then won the blitz playoff 2\u20130 to advance to the final. \nIn the final, he faced Alexander Grischuk. After drawing the first five games, Gelfand won the sixth and final game on the white side of a Gr\u00fcnfeld defence to win the match 3.5\u20132.5. As winner of the Candidates series, Gelfand face Anand for the 2012 World Championship. In this match Gelfand tied 6\u20136, but he lost the four-game rapid play tie-breaker."}

The Winchester students call this period \"common time.\" It was originally played during the autumn term, or \"short half.\" It is very similar to games played at other public schools such as Eton's wall game and Harrow game. The school is located in the city of Winchester in Hampshire, England. \nHistory.\nThis game was originally played down Kingsgate Street, a long street that runs parallel to the college. However, there were very few rules. The only thing that has not changed is that the canvas (the pitch or field the game is played on) has the same measurements as the part of the street the original version of the game was played on.\nNobody knows when the game was moved. It was moved away from the town to the grassland at the top of St. Catherine's Hill. To stop the ball from going into the canal below, the players used junior men from the college to go fetch it when it was not caught by the players. In the current version of the game, there are still classmates used as watchers who catch stray balls. However, there were problems with this. The biggest is the lines of watchers were depleted due to players being too enthusiastic and colliding with each other, causing injuries. So they introduced ropes to mark out the border of the playing field. These are now a core part of the game."}

She was the strongest female player of the 1960s and 70s, and became the sixth Women's World Chess Champion (1962\u20131978). She was the first woman to achieve the Grandmaster title.\nIn 1961, aged 20, Gaprindashvili won the fourth women's Candidates Tournament, setting up a title match against Russian world champion Elisabeth Bykova. She won the match easily, with a final score of 9\u22122 (+7\u22120=4), and went on to defend her title successfully four times. She finally lost her crown in 1978 to another Georgian, Maia Chiburdanidze, by a score of 6\u00bd\u20138\u00bd (+2\u22124=9).\nGaprindashvili played for Soviet Union in the women's chess Olympiads of 1963, 1966, 1969, 1972, 1974, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1990, and for Georgia in 1992.

During her career Gaprindashvili successfully competed in men's tournaments, tying for first place at Lone Pine, California in 1977.\nIn 1978 Gaprindashvili became the first woman to be awarded the Grandmaster title. She was awarded the title partly as a result of winning Lone Pine 1977 against a field of 45 players, mostly grandmasters. Although she did not meet the technical requirements for the GM Title, this result was so spectacular that FIDE found it sufficient.\nPal Benko wrote in \"Chess Life &amp; Review\" (January 1979):\nNona was the first President of the National Olympic Committee of Georgia.

They both saw that women needed more freedom to help change society. They began helping the women's rights movement.\nIn 1838, the sisters became the first women to speak at a meeting of the Massachusetts state legislature. They spoke about slavery and abolitionism. People were very shocked. They helped attract thousands of women in New England to the movement. Many came to hear Sarah and Angelina speak at public lectures.\nIn 1838, Sarah wrote a paper called \"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women.\" It answered many questions which were asked in a letter by a group of ministers who did not like the sisters because they had stepped out of their \"woman's proper sphere\".\nWhen Sarah was 80, she tried to vote.\nThey lived to see the end to slavery, and the beginning of women's rights."}

It is the imaginary line drawn by the experts which has a particular amount if anybody earn income which is lower than this amount is known as poor and other who earn more than this amount is known as non-poor. People who are below this line are classified as poor. This line is used to decide who can get extra help with things like food, shelter or medical care. There is a poverty line based on the income and another based on consumption levels.\nThe poverty line is not the same in all countries. It can be decided by the economy. In the United States, the poverty line is different depending on how many people there are in a family. This is because it costs more to buy food and supplies for more people. So, for example, it is higher in a family with eight people than in a family with three people. The poverty line also makes sure the poor and rich are separated immensely. If there were not a poverty line, the distribution of goods to those of whom are actually poor, would decrease. "}

There were six ships in the fleet: one Royal Navy Escort, four convict ships, and a supply ship.\nThe ships were meant to sail to Australia together, and get to Sydney Cove in 1789. However the escort ship was wrecked on the way and did not arrive, and one convict ship was delayed and arrived two months after the other ships.\nUnlike the First Fleet, where great efforts were taken to keep the convicts healthy, the Second Fleet was run by private businesses who kept the convicts in horrific conditions. When they got to Sydney, the sick convicts were a drain on the already struggling colony.\nOrigins and history.\nThe \"Lady Juliana\" sailed before the other convict ships and is not always counted as part of the Second Fleet. The supply ship \"Justinian\" did not sail with the convict ships and arrived before them. \"HMS Guardian\" set out before the convict ships but struck ice after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, went back to southern Africa and was wrecked on the coast.\nThe \"Surprize\", \"Neptune\" and \"Scarborough\" were sent by the firm \"Camden, Calvert &amp; King\". They had agreed to transport, clothe and feed the convicts for a fee of \u00a317 7s. 6d per head This fee was paid whether the convicts landed dead or alive. This firm had previously been in the business of taking slaves to North America. The only government people on the ship were the naval agent, Lieutenant John Shapcote, and the Captain of the Guard; all other crew were supplied by the firm.\nThe Second Fleet left England on 19 January 1790, with 1,006 convicts (928 male and 78 female). They made only one stop on the way, at the Cape of Good Hope. Here 20 male convicts, survivors from \"Guardian\", were taken on board. The three ships made a faster trip than the First Fleet, arriving at Port Jackson in the last week of June 1790. This was three weeks after \"Lady Juliana\", and one week after the supply ship \"Justinian\".\nThe trip was fast, but the rate of people dying was the highest in the history of transportation to Australia. Of the 1,026 convicts who left, 267 (256 men and 11 women) died during the voyage (26%). \nOn \"Neptune\" the convicts were not given enough food, they were kept tied up with chains, and rarely let up onto the deck. Many of them got scurvy. On \"Scarborough\", they were fed, but a reported mutiny attempt led to the convicts being kept locked up below the deck.\nCaptain William Hill, Captain of the guard, later wrote that the ships' captains did not feed the convicts so that they could sell the food in another country. They wanted the convicts to die quickly so that they did not have to waste the food on them and could keep it for sale later.\nArrival in Sydney.\nWhen they got to Sydney, the half naked convicts were lying without bedding, too ill to move. Those unable to walk were thrown over the side. All were covered with lice. At least 486 of the convicts were sick, 47% of those who had left England. The others were described as \u201clean and emaciated\u201d and showing \u201cmore horrid spectacles than had ever been witnessed in this country\u201d.\nAmong the people on the Second Fleet were D'Arcy Wentworth and his convict mistress Catherine Crowley, on \"Neptune\", and John Macarthur, then a young lieutenant in the New South Wales Corps, and his wife Elizabeth, on \"Scarborough\". Macarthur's eldest son, Edward Macarthur, who came with his parents on the \"Neptune\" and \"Scarborough\", is believed to be the only person who sailed in the Second Fleet of whom we have a photograph. He was also the last survivor of the voyage.\nWhen news of the horrors of the Second Fleet reached England, both the public and government were shocked. An enquiry was held but no attempt was made to arrest Donald Traill, captain of \"Neptune\". He had been described as an insane sadist. The government did not charge him, the other captains, or the firm of contractors. They had already been contracted by the government to prepare the Third Fleet for sailing to Port Jackson in 1791.\nTraill and his Chief Mate, William Ellerington, were privately put in court for the murder of an unnamed convict, seaman Andrew Anderson, and John Joseph, cook. But, after a trial lasting three hours before Sir James Marriott in the Admiralty Court, the jury set both men free \"without troubling the Judge to sum up the evidence\"."}

The Romans conquered many people and brought back from their wars many things from each land. Their way of life was a mix of many cultures, influences, and religions. Starting in the 2nd century BC, Greek influence became very important. Architecture, painting, sculpture, laws, and literature grew to a high level. Slaves, and Christians were treated differently by different rulers. Rome was a trading nation which kept military control over a wide range of peoples, mostly around the Mediterranean.\nClasses.\nThere were four classes of people in Rome: the aristocrats, the equestrians, the common citizens, and the slaves. The aristocrat class had about 300 families, mostly senators. The aristocrat class was very powerful. The equestrians or \u201cequites\u201d were merchants, government builders, and bankers who were usually less rich. The common citizens were farmers, industrial workers, and the city mob. Slaves had to work hard and were usually released when they became old. Some slaves were trained to be gladiators for people to watch. Other slaves worked in rich homes as doorkeepers, litter-bearers, messengers, or servants. Some Greek slaves were teachers who taught their language, or doctors.\nReligion.\nThe original Roman religion had many gods, with stories called Roman mythology.\nChristianity.\nAt the time of the birth of Jesus, the Roman Empire ruled the entire Mediterranean area. Jesus taught to worship God only. Because Christians worshiped only God and did not join in the festivals to other gods, Romans thought they were unpatriotic. Many Christians were crucified. Romans persecuted them for many years. Sometimes they were killed by animals for a show.\nHowever, Christianity still spread in the Roman Empire. A great change took place when Constantine I became emperor. He moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium, converted to Christianity, and protected Christians from harm. Many Romans continued to worship the old gods.\nHouse.\nIn the Imperial Age, the poorer Roman houses were built of sun-dried brick. These houses only had one room. In this one room the family slept, ate, and had visitors. Richer people had mansions. Statues and paintings were shown. Small rooms were used as living and dining places. In the center there was a court with a garden. It was decorated with fountains, plants, and flowers. Floors were often made of mosaics, tiles, or marble with lots of different colors. Some walls were painted. Dishes were made of pottery or glass. There was plumbing in some houses and in the public baths, and a sewer system was used. Hot air warmed the house from a heating system. Many rich Romans had two houses, one in the town and one in the country.\nPoor people lived in buildings where the top floors were for the poorest. Sometimes they could have as many as 200 steps to reach them. Many fires happened. Buckets of water were used to put out fires, though many times it did not work.\nMeals.\nPoor people ate vegetables, fish, salt, cheese, fruits, nuts, and olive oil. Meat, especially beef, was usually not eaten. Breakfast was usually not eaten and, for lunch, leftovers were used. Rich people ate dinner before four in the afternoon. They usually ate from three to ten hours. Hands were washed between the courses. One emperor served 22 courses at his dinner parties. If visitors were invited to dinner, slaves were sent to bring them on time, because water clocks did not always work the same. People enjoyed eating grapes for dessert. At first, cold clams and oysters were eaten for dessert, but later people ate them at the beginning of a meal instead.\nPublic baths.\nThe public baths were used not only for bathing. Besides the hot water rooms and cold water rooms, there were gardens, stadiums, art galleries, libraries, and places to eat. There were even underground passageways to get to places more easily. Aqueducts fed water for the baths. They were so well built that some are still used. \nThe Romans were very proud of their aqueducts. They thought they were better than the \"useless\" Egyptian pyramids. They also used these for drinking water.\nShips.\nBig ships called \"quinqueremes\" had 300 people to row with oars. They could travel 100 miles (160 km) a day. Trade paths were protected from pirates. Many ships carried food; others carried pearls, pepper, cotton, cinnamon, and silk. A pound of silk, at that time, cost a pound of gold.\nArts.\nLanguage and literature.\nThe native language of the Romans was Latin. Its alphabet was based on the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn based on the Greek alphabet.\nThe surviving Latin literature is in Classical Latin from the 1st century BC. The spoken language of the Roman Empire was Vulgar Latin, which differed from Classical Latin in grammar and vocabulary, and eventually in pronunciation.\nOut of Latin came Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Italian. Latin was used for medicine and science words.\nLatin remained the main written language of the Roman Empire. Greek became the language spoken by the well-educated elite, because most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. Roman literature was much influenced by Greek literature. Some of the best known examples are the \"Aeneid\" by Virgil, Plutarch's \"Lives of Famous Men\", and \"Odes\" by Horace.\nIn the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which later became the Byzantine Empire, Latin did not replace Greek at all. After the death of Justinian, Greek became the official language of the Byzantine government. The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe. Vulgar Latin evolved into dialects in different locations, gradually changing into the distinct Romance languages.\nArchitecture.\nThe Romans built great roads and bridges. They wrote plays and kept the Phoenician alphabet. The Romans were usually practical, and kept the Grecian culture alive. Many of the aqueducts they made are still there and used. Rome also had the first hospitals in the Western World. They also had the first system of state medicine for poor people.\nTheir buildings were decorated by mosaics on the floors, and paintings done directly on the walls.\nMusic.\nThe Romans' music was an important part of their lives. Song (known as \"carmen\") was part of almost every social occasion. Music accompanied spectacles and events in the arena. It was part of the performing arts form called \"pantomimus\", an early form of story ballet that combined expressive dancing, instrumental music and a sung libretto.\nThey were influenced by Etruscan and Greek music. What the Romans sang simply followed the natural melody of the song.."}

Adolf Seilacher coined the term in 1970 to describe sites, like Solnhofen, which yielded the most exceptional fossils.\nExtra-special sites are called \"Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tten\" (conservation Lagerst\u00e4tten). These are deposits known for the exceptional preservation of fine details. There skeletons are mostly articulated (bones together in life form), and the soft parts are preserved as impressions or casts. \nPreservation.\nIn Lagerst\u00e4tten the normal processses of decay after death were less active or halted as sediment was deposited. This allowed the preservation of soft parts and exceptional detail. \nThere are several possible causes which allow this to happen:\nIn these conditions, which are exceptional, scavengers, burrowers and bacteria are eliminated or reduced. Then the normal processes of deposition and fossilisation produces strata containing exceptional fossils.\nLessons learnt.\nMost of what we know about the details of extinct life comes from these exceptional sites. The soft-bodied Ediacaran biota, the fins of ichthyosaurs, the fur and wing structure of pterosaurs, the feathers on Mesozoic dinosaurs and birds, are all discoveries made on fossils from Lagerst\u00e4tten. These sites preserve much of the fauna and flora of the time and place. That permits reconstruction of its ecology.\nShort-list of Lagerst\u00e4tten.\nThere are about 50 sites which have been described as Lagerst\u00e4tten. "}

The British artist and art critic Roger Fry used the term in 1910, and it is now a standard art term. Fry organized the 1910 exhibition \"Manet and the Post-Impressionists\".\nThe post-impressionists were artists of the late 19th century who saw the work of the French Impressionist painters and were influenced by them. Their art styles grew out of the style called Impressionism. The word \"Post-\" means \"after\", so \"post-impressionist\" painting came after \"impressionist\" painting. These artists developed impressionism but rejected its limitations. They continued using the real-life subject matter, with vivid colours, often with thick paint. However, they added other ideas. Using geometric forms, to distorting form for effect, and using unnatural colours are some of their ways. The critic Rewald said \"the term 'post-impressionism' is not a very precise one, though a very convenient one\".\nThe main post-impressionist painters were Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Georges Seurat, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec and Henri Rousseau ('Le Douanier'). Picasso and Braque were certainly post-impressionists, but we describe them as Cubists.\nThe post-impressionist painters lived in France and knew each other, but they did not work together as a group, in the way that some of the impressionists did. They painted in ways that were different from each other. The post-impressionists led the way for other artists to experiment and develop all the different styles of Modern art in the 20th century.\nInfluence.\nThe Post-Impressionist painters all experimented in different ways with the ideas of the Impressionists. Most of the important art movements (styles) of the twentieth century developed out of their work. Even though the Post-Impressionist painters were not well known in their lifetimes, they became so famous that in the 21st century their paintings sell for millions of dollars.\nGallery.\nClick on each image to enlarge it, to see the way each artist has used brush-strokes and colour."}

He finally lost the title to Capablanca in 1921.\nLasker demanded high fees for playing matches and tournaments, which aroused some criticism. He had seen how Steinitz's life had ended in poverty, and was determined to avoid this fate. \nThe conditions which Lasker demanded for World Championship matches in the last ten years of his reign were controversial, and prompted attempts to define rules for championship matches.\nLasker was also a talented mathematician, and his Ph.D. thesis is regarded as one of the foundations of modern algebra. He was a first-class contract bridge player and wrote about this and other games, including Go and his own invention, \"Lasca\".\nLife and career.\nEarly years (1868\u20131894).\nEmanuel Lasker was the son of a Jewish cantor. At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics, where he lived with his brother Berthold, eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. To supplement their income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, especially at the Caf\u00e9\u00a0Kaiserhof.\nIn 1890 he finished third in Graz, then shared first prize with his brother Berthold in a tournament in Berlin. In spring 1892, he won two tournaments in London, the second and stronger of these without losing a game. At New York 1893, he won all thirteen games, one of the few times in chess history that a player has achieved a perfect score in a significant tournament.p81 \nHis record in matches was equally impressive: at Berlin in 1890 he drew a short play-off match against his brother Berthold; and won all his other matches from 1889 to 1893, mostly against top-class opponents: Curt von Bardeleben 1889; Jacques Mieses 1889; Henry Edward Bird 1890; Berthold Englisch 1890; Joseph Henry Blackburne 1892, without losing a game; Jackson Showalter 1892\u20131893; and Celso Golmayo Z\u00fapide 1893. \nIn 1892 Lasker founded the first of his chess magazines, \"The London Chess Fortnightly\", which was published from August 15, 1892 to July 30, 1893. In the second quarter of 1893 there was a gap of ten weeks between issues, allegedly because of problems with the printer. Shortly after its last issue Lasker traveled to the USA, where he spent the next two years.\nLasker challenged Siegbert Tarrasch, who had won three consecutive international tournaments, to a match. Tarrasch haughtily declined, stating that Lasker should first prove his mettle by attempting to win one or two major international events.p31\nChess competition (1894\u20131918).\nMatch against Steinitz.\nRebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker challenged the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to a match for the title.p31 Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side, but the final figure was $2,000. The final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values. \nThe match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and was able to maintain the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz was unable to compensate for his losses in the middle of the match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses and four draws. Lasker thus became the second recognized World Chess Champion, and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re-match in 1896\u20131897 (ten wins, five draws, and two losses).\nMatch against Schlechter.\nLasker won first prizes at very strong tournaments in St. Petersburg 1895\u20131896, Nuremberg 1896, London 1899, Paris 1900. As time passed, there arose two great players, Akiba Rubinstein and Capablanca. Both deserved a match for the world championship, but as it turned out, the chance came to another fine player, Carl Schlechter.\nLasker arranged the World Chess Championship match against Schlechter in January\u2013February 1910. Schlechter was a modest man, who was generally unlikely to win the major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw).p404 \nThe conditions of the match are still debatable, because they were never published.p357 Some claim that Schlechter accepted especially unfavourable conditions. Giffard says he would need to finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match, and he would need to win a revenge match to be declared World Champion.p404 This opinion is not proven.\nThe match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten.\nIn the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but made a mistake which cost him the game. Schlechter was now a point ahead. The score before the last game was 5\u20134 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win and took a clear advantage, but he missed a win on his 35th move, and finished by losing.p406 Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.\nAt St. Petersburg 1914 he overcame a 1\u00bd point deficit to finish ahead of the rising stars Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine.\nMatch against Capablanca.\nIn January 1920 Lasker and Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. \nThe match was played in March\u2013April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker blunder with Black in an equal ending. Capablanca's solid style allowed him to easily draw the next four games, without taking any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.\nSome commentators attributed the result to Lasker's being in mysteriously poor form. On the other hand Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an \"even and fascinating fight\" until Lasker blundered in the last game, and explained that Capablanca was twenty years younger, a slightly stronger player, and had more recent competitive practice.\nLater life.\nAfter winning the New York 1924 chess tournament (1\u00bd points ahead of Capablanca) and finishing second at Moscow in 1925 (1\u00bd points behind Efim Bogoljubow, \u00bd point ahead of Capablanca), he effectively retired from serious chess.\nIn 1926 Lasker wrote \"Lehrbuch des Schachspiels\", which he re-wrote in English in 1927 as \"Lasker's Manual of Chess\". He also wrote books on other games of mental skill: \"Encyclopedia of games\" (1929) and \"Das verst\u00e4ndige Kartenspiel\" (1929); English translation in the same year. Both these books posed a problem in the mathematical analysis of card games. \"Brettspiele der V\u00f6lker\" (\"Board games of the nations\" 1931) had 30 pages about Go and a section about a game he had invented in 1911, \"Lasca\". \"Das Bridgespiel\" \"The Game of Bridge\" was published in 1931. Lasker became an expert bridge player, representing Germany at international events in the early 1930s, and a registered teacher of the Culbertson system. \nIn October 1928 Emanuel Lasker's brother Berthold died.p266\nIn spring 1933 Adolf Hitler started a campaign of discrimination and intimidation against Jews, depriving them of their property and citizenship. Lasker and his wife Martha, who were both Jewish, left Germany the same year.p268 p218 After a stay in England, in 1935 they were invited to live in the USSR by Nikolai Krylenko, the Commissar of Justice responsible for the Moscow show trials and also Sports Minister. Krylenko was an enthusiastic supporter of chess. In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took up residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics, and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.\nLasker returned to competitive chess to make some money, finishing fifth in Z\u00fcrich 1934; third in Moscow 1935 behind Mikhail Botvinnik and Salo Flohr and ahead of Capablanca and other masters; sixth in Moscow 1936 and seventh equal in Nottingham 1936. His performance in Moscow 1935 at age 66 was hailed as \"a biological miracle\".\nStalin's Great Purge started at about the same time the Laskers arrived in the USSR. In August 1937, Martha and Emanuel Lasker decided to leave the Soviet Union, and they moved, via the Netherlands, to the United States (first Chicago, next New York) in October 1937.\nIn the following year Emanuel Lasker's patron, Krylenko, was purged by Stalin. Lasker tried to support himself by giving chess and bridge lectures and exhibitions, as he was now too old for serious competition. In 1940 he published his last book, \"The community of the future\", in which he proposed solutions for serious political problems, including anti-Semitism and unemployment. Lasker died of a kidney infection in New York on 11 January 1941, at the age of 72."}

It always keeps the formula exactly the same mathematically as the original equation or expression, unless it is being transformed, by a transformation algorithm.\nA CAS might be used for integration or differentiation (and other calculus transformations), simplification of an expression (making it smaller and/or simpler), optimizing and finding the minimum and maximum values of results or variables, etc. Most have the ability to plot functions and expressions for visualization, which can be helpful and educational too.\nSymbolic capabilities.\nComputer algebra systems can be special purpose, focusing on only a few types of symbolic math, to very large, general purpose programs that do almost everything (for example, the free CAS Maxima, which is the oldest CAS that is still under development). The results output by a good computer algebra system are often exact, simple, and generalized to work in all possible cases. Computer programs do have bugs, so important results should always be verified for correctness.\nNumeric capabilities.\nModern computer algebra systems often include extensive numeric capabilities for convenience and which fit together with its symbolic abilities.\nNumeric domains supported often include real, complex, interval, rational, and algebraic numbers.\nUsually floating point arithmetic is available to use if desired, because the arithmetic is done by most computer hardware very quickly. The down-side of floating point arithmetic is that it is not always exact, and is mostly useless for rocket science, because of only 14 decimal digits of accuracy (with double precision floats), and because of a growing round-off error with each calculation, sometimes even less digits are accurate. Rational number arithmetic is exact if all numbers are rational. Interval arithmetic can be used to easily calculate the total possible error of an inexact arithmetic system. Complex number arithmetic is generally supported by allowing the imaginary unit (formula_1) in expressions and following all of its algebraic rules."}

The other is the northern corroboree frog. The southern corroboree frog is a very small frog with warning colouration. It has black and yellow stripes, sometimes with a greenish tinge. It is one of the brightest frogs in the world.\nIt only lives in an area of about in the Kosciusko National Park in south east Australia. Scientists believe that the total population of corroboree frogs is less than 250. Numbers of the frog have reduced by 80% in the last ten years, and so the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) have listed the southern corroboree frog as being a critically endangered species.\nHabitat.\nThe southern corroboree frog live in a small area in the Kosciusko National Park. It usually lives in Snow Gum forest, and Sphagnum swamps. These places are very cold, because the Corroboree Frog only lives in areas higher than 1000m above sea level. The corroboree frogs breed in small ponds and wetlands during the summer months.\nPhysical description.\nThe southern corroboree frog has a very distinctive pattern of black with bright yellow stripes. They are very small, only around long when fully grown. The female frog is usually larger than the male and can be as big as They mainly eat bugs, like ants, beetles and mites. They have a very different breeding cycle to most other frogs. Most frogs breed in spring, but these frogs only breed in summer during January and February. They use the wet areas to dig small holes for their mating and nesting. They lay between 16-40 eggs. The eggs hatch 4\u20136 months later when water levels rise and flood the nests. The frogs live as tadpoles for another 6\u20138 months. They change into frogs at the start of summer in December. They become sexually active after another two years. The frogs are not known to survive a second breeding season.\nToxicity.\nCorroboree frogs are the first vertebrates discovered that are able to make their own poisonous alkaloid, pseudo-phrynamine. Most other frogs get it from their diet. The alkaloid is secreted from the skin as a defence against predators, and perhaps against skin infections by microbes.\nConservation.\nThe southern corroboree frog is Australia\u2019s most endangered frog. Scientists have not discovered a reason for the reduction in frog numbers. There are a range of problems that affect the area that they live in. Increased access by people with four-wheel drive vehicles and the development of ski resorts are destroying their habitat. Global warming is also a big problem for them, because they are used to the cold. Global warming may shorten the frog's breeding time during winter, and also destroy their snowy habitat. Holes in the ozone layer may also be a problem, because when there are holes in the ozone it means that more sun rays hit the ground, and so there is less snow. Disease from funguses can kill lots of the frogs. Erosion and pollution of waterways in which they breed can kill the frogs' eggs. They are also affected by wild pigs which destroy the wetlands.\nThe NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service are now breeding the frogs in laboratories, and then releasing them into the wild when they are fully grown. After the bushfires in the summer of 2002 and 2003 all the eggs in the wild were collected and taken to the Melbourne Zoo for hatching."}

The library is in the capital city of Victoria, Melbourne. It is on Swanston Street, in the northern centre of the central business district. The library holds over 1.5 million books and 16,000 serials. Special books in the library include the diaries of the city's founders, John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner, and Captain James Cook.\nHistory.\nIn 1853 the decision to build a state library was the idea of the Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe and Sir Redmond Barry. A competition was held to choose a person to design the new building; local architect Joseph Reed, who later designed the Melbourne Town Hall and the Royal Exhibition Building, won the competition.\nOn 3 July 1854, the new Governor, Sir Charles Hotham, laid the foundation stone of both the new library and the University of Melbourne. The library opened in 1856, with a collection of 3,800 books chosen by Sir Redmond, the President of Trustees. Augustus H. Tulk, the first librarian, was started work three months after the opening.\nThe first reading room was the Queen's Reading Room, now called Queen's Hall, which opened in 1859. Temporary buildings built in 1866 for the Intercolonial Exhibition were used until 1909, when work began on a new building to mark the library's Jubilee. This new building was the famous Domed Reading Room, which opened in 1913, designed by Norman G. Peebles. \nPlans for the rebuilding were cut back as there was not enough money for the original design. A new building for the museum was built after World War 1, in a plain classical style.\nThe reading dome's original high windows were changed and covered in copper sheets in 1959 because water was getting into the building. \nThe library was also home to the State's Art Gallery and Museum until the National Gallery of Victoria moved to St Kilda Road in the late 1960s. The new Melbourne Museum was built in the Carlton Gardens in the 1990s.\nThe library underwent a lot of rebuilding between 1990 and 2004, designed by architects Ancher Mortlock &amp; Woolley. The project cost about AU$200 million. The reading room closed in 1999 to allow for renovation, during which dome's windows were put back. The renamed La Trobe Reading Room reopened in 2003.\nThe rebuilt library includes a number of exhibition spaces which are used for the permanent exhibitions; \"The Mirror of the World: Books and Ideas \" and \"The Changing Face of Victoria\". there is also a display from the Pictures Collection in the Cowen Gallery. The State Library of Victoria is one of the largest exhibiting libraries in the world.\nFront lawn and statues.\nThe grassy lawn in front of the library's grand entrance on Swanston Street is a popular lunch-spot for the city's workers and students at the nearby RMIT University. When the library was built, there was a wooden picket fence around the building. In the 1870's a new wrought iron fence and gates were built. The space was opened when this fence was taken away in 1939. \nA number of statues are in the entrance area:\nOn Sundays between 2.30pm and 5.30pm a speakers' forum takes place in front of the library, where people take turns in speaking on various subjects.\nRooms.\nReading Room and Dome.\nThe landmark Domed Reading Room, which opened in 1913 and was designed by Norman G. Peebles. Its octagonal space was designed to hold over a million books and up to 500 readers. It is 34.75 m in both diameter and height, and its oculus is nearly 5 m wide. The dome was the largest of its type in the world on completion. \nIn 1965, the La Trobe Building was opened to hold the Library's collection of Australian items. This has now been moved into the La Trobe Reading Room.\nArts Library.\nThe library has a large, world-class collection of books, periodicals, recordings and other materials about art, music and the performing arts.\nChess room.\nThe library has a chess room that houses a wide range of materials on the history, study and practice of chess. It contains a collection of items from the Anderson Chess Collection, one of the three largest public chess collections in the world. In addition to bookshelves containing a large range of books and magazines about chess, the room has game tables with chessboards and pieces. There are also glass cabinets with historical chess items. The room is meant for both reading, playing and studying.\nCollections.\nDatabases.\nMany of the library's electronic databases can be used from home to any Victorian who is a State Library User. Databases include the full Encyclopaedia Britannica; Oxford Reference dictionaries and encyclopaedias; multi-subject magazine and journal article databases; newspaper collections of most major Australian and international papers from 2000 onwards; and specialist subject databases.

It was given with a limited edition PSP Slim &amp; Lite. As part of the \"Jak and Daxter\" series of games, Daxter takes place at the beginning of \"Jak II\".\nAs of June 11, 2008, the game has sold 2.3 million copies.\nPlot.\nThe game takes place in the final months of the two-year gap presented in the opening of \"Jak II\", between the moment when Jak is taken prisoner by the Krimzon Guard and the time in which Daxter finally rescues him. The introduction shows Jak being captured, while Daxter manages to escape. Almost two years later (having no luck of rescuing Jak), Daxter has forgotten all about rescuing his friend. An old man named Osmo, whom Daxter meets, hires Daxter as an exterminator. \nAfter some missions, Daxter finds his friend Jak in a Prison Zoomer and proceeds to chase after it. He is then cornered by Krimzon Guards, but is rescued by Osmo's son, Ximon. Daxter then receives a bug sidekick named Tik. He then goes to Baron Praxis's palace and gets a map of the prison where Jak is being held. When returning back to the extermination shop, Tik is killed by Kaeden, a bitter man who seemingly wants to steal Osmo's shop, but is really working for an evil mastermind. \nWhen Daxter tries to stop Kaeden from escaping the shop, Kaeden suddenly blows up the shop with a bomb he placed in the shop earlier. Daxter and Osmo survive, and Daxter promises to stop Kaeden, but only after he rescues Jak. He infiltrates The Prison, and rescues Jak. Daxter finds Kaeden, who reveals himself to be a giant insect, but he is defeated by Daxter. The whole game reveals to be a tale which Daxter told Jak, and his friends, at the bar.\nGameplay.\nDue to his new job, Daxter now has an electro-swatter, which acts as his melee weapon, and an extermination tank, which sprays bug spray (Which many have confused with Green Eco) to stun enemies. The tank eventually receives several modifications, including doubling as a type of jet-pack that allows Daxter to fly, flamethrower capabilities, and an ultrasonic attachment. The flamethrower modification allows Daxter to hover higher and longer in jet-pack mode. With the ultra-sonic attachment, Daxter can shoot a projectile resembling a blue grenade that causes high radial damage, but uses one fifth of the player's maximum bug spray.\nReception and sales.\nDaxter was very well received by critics. IGN gave it a 9/10 and GameSpot gave it a 9.1/10. It has a 86.2% at Game Rankings. As of June 11, 2008, the game has sold 2.3 million copies."}

A person looks into the kaleidoscope through one end and sees patterns created by reflections of the objects inside.\nIn 1815, Fatik Tausif Momin\n began work that led to the invention of the kaleidoscope. At that time, he was doing experiments on light polarization. The kaleidoscope was not patented until two years later. His first design was a tube with pairs of mirrors at one end, pairs translucent disks at the other, and beads between the two. In 1817, Brewster chose the well-known lens developer Philip Carpenter to be the only manufacturer of the kaleidoscope. It was a big success. Two hundred thousand kaleidoscopes were sold in London and Paris in just three months. Brewster knew that the company could not make as many kaleidoscopes as people wanted. On 17 May 1818, he asked Saad Khan\n allow them to be made by other manufacturers. Carpenter agreed. At first, the kaleidoscope was meant to be a scientific tool. Later it was used as a toy. Brewster believed he would make money from the kaleidoscope. However, a fault in his patent application allowed others to copy it."}

Sometimes, though, baking can also be done in hot ashes, or hot stones. It is used for making bread, cakes, pastries, pies, tarts, cookies, and much more. Such foods made by baking are called \"baked goods\". \nThe ingredients used in baking include flour, water, leavening agents (baker's yeast, baking soda, baking powder), shortening (fats, oils), eggs, milk, and sugars. These are all mixed together to create dough or batter, which is then put into a pan or a sheet and heated. Leavening agents produce gas that becomes trapped in the dough. This makes it rise. Shortening makes doughs more easily workable and the bread that comes out in the end more soft and tender. Egg whites are used to help make a light, airy texture.\nBaked goods are sold at a bakery. A person who makes baked goods as a job is called a baker. It is also used for making baked potatoes, baked apples, baked beans, some casseroles and pasta dishes such as lasagna, and various other foods, such as the pretzel.\nHistory.\nIn ancient history, the first baking happened when humans took wild grass grains, and soaked them in water. Then they mixed everything together, and also mashed it. After that, this mixture was poured onto a flat, hot rock, and roasted on hot embers. This new way of making bread was much easier than the other ways of doing so. This was because bread could be made anytime if there was fire. \nAround 2500 BC Egyptians had bread, and may have learned how to make it from the Babylonians. Also, the Greeks around 400 B.C. tarts with patterns and honey was included in Greek food. Dispyrus, another type of baked good, was also made by the Greeks around that time. It was popular. Dispyrus was a donut-like bread made from flour and honey and shaped in a ring. Soaked in wine, it was eaten when hot. The first proof of stone ovens was in Italy, where they made pizza and pasta.\nBaking was very popular in the Roman Empire. In about 300 B.C., the pastry cook became a special job for Romans (called the \"pastillarium\"). Romans loved pastry, which was often cooked for large parties. Baking became so popular during the Roman Empire that someone who could think of a new kind of pastry was given an award. Around 1 AD there were more than 300 pastry chefs in Rome. \nEventually, because of Rome, the art of baking became known in Europe. It later spread to the eastern parts of Asia, too. Bakers sometimes bake goods at home and then sell them in the streets. In London, chefs sold their baked goods from handcarts. In Paris, the first caf\u00e9 of baked goods was made. Baking became a real art in the world. Cakes can be actually mixed in just a few minutes, with only a small bit of skill needed, and it can be lifted fresh from the oven in less than 30 minutes. A basic loaf of bread may take slightly longer time, but it does not demand a lot of time from the cook."}

He grew up into a cultured and charming man, whom the Cuban government made its roving ambassador-at-large. He was a media celebrity: his travels round the world were reported in newspapers, radio and movie newsreels. In his lifetime, he was probably the Cuban best known to the rest of the world.\nIn December 1921, shortly after becoming World Champion, Capablanca married Gloria Simoni Betancourt. They had a son, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Jr., in 1923 and a daughter, Gloria, in 1925. According to Capablanca's second wife, Olga, his first marriage broke down fairly soon.\nChildhood.\nJos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca was the second surviving son of an army officer. According to Capablanca, he learned the rules of the game at the age of four by watching his father play, pointed out an illegal move by his father, and then beat his father twice. At the age of eight he was taken to Havana Chess Club, which had hosted many important contests, but on the advice of a doctor he was not allowed to play frequently.\nBetween November and December 1901, he narrowly beat the Cuban Chess Champion, Juan Corzo, in a match. However, in April 1902 he only came fourth out of six in the National Championship, losing both his games against Corzo. In 1905 Capablanca passed with ease the entrance examinations for Columbia University in New York City. He wished to play for Columbia's strong baseball team, and soon was selected as shortstop on the freshman team. In the same year he joined the Manhattan Chess Club, and was soon recognized as the club's strongest player. He was particularly dominant in rapid chess, winning a tournament ahead of the reigning World Chess Champion, Emanuel Lasker, in 1906. In 1908 he left the university to concentrate on chess.\nAdult life.\nEarly adult life.\nThe San Sebastian tournament of 1911 was \"one of the strongest five tournaments held up to that time\", as all the world's leading players competed except the World Champion, Lasker, who was inactive in serious play at the time. At the beginning of the tournament, Ossip Bernstein and Aron Nimzowitsch objected to Capablanca's presence because he had not fulfilled the entry condition of winning at least third prize in two master tournaments. Capablanca won brilliantly against Bernstein in the very first round, and more simply against Nimzowitsch. He astounded the chess world by taking first place, with a score of six wins, one loss and seven draws, ahead of Akiba Rubinstein, Milan Vidmar, Frank Marshall, Carl Schlechter and Siegbert Tarrasch. His loss, against Rubinstein, was one of the most brilliant achievements of the latter's career. Capablanca was now recognized as a serious contender for the world championship.p33\nWorld title contender.\nIn 1911, Capablanca challenged Emanuel Lasker for the World Chess Championship. Lasker accepted his challenge while proposing seventeen conditions for the match. Capablanca objected to some of the conditions, which significantly favored Lasker, and the match did not take place.p67\nIn September 1913, Capablanca secured a job in the Cuban Foreign Office, which made him financially secure throughout his life. \"He had no specific duties, but was expected to act as a kind of ambassador-at-large, a well-known figure who would put Cuba on the map wherever he travelled\".p58\nThe St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament was the first in which Capablanca played World Champion Emanuel Lasker under normal tournament conditions. The St. Petersburg event was arranged in an unusual way: after a preliminary single-round all-play-all tournament of eleven players, the top five were to play a second stage in a double round format, with scores from the preliminary tournament carried forward to the second contest. Capablanca placed first in the preliminary tournament, 1\u00bd points ahead of Lasker, who was out of practice and made a shaky start. Despite a determined effort by Lasker, Capablanca still seemed on course for ultimate victory. However, in their second game of the final, Lasker reduced Capablanca to a helpless position and Capablanca was so shaken by this that he blundered away his next game to Tarrasch. Lasker thus finished half a point ahead of Capablanca and 3\u00bd ahead of Alekhine.\nAlekhine commented:\nAfter the breakdown of his attempt to negotiate a title match in 1911, Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges, which were agreed by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year. The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games, whichever the champion preferred; and the stake should be at least \u00a31,000 (worth about \u00a3347,000 or $700,000 in 2006 terms).\nWorld Champion.\nIn January 1920, Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921. The match was played in March\u2013April 1921; Lasker resigned it after just fourteen games, having lost four games and won none. Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an \"even and fascinating fight\" until Lasker blundered in the last game. Kramnik's explanation was that Capablanca was twenty years younger, a slightly stronger player, and had more recent competitive practice.\nCapablanca came second at the New York 1924 tournament, 1\u00bd points behind Emanuel Lasker, though two ahead of third-placed Alekhine, with the score of 14/20 (+10 -1 =9). Capablanca's defeat at the hands of Richard Reti in the fifth round was his first in serious competition in eight years. He made another bad start at the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, and could only fight back to third place, two\u00a0points behind Bogolyubov and \u00bd\u00a0point behind Emanuel Lasker.\nA group of Argentinian businessmen, backed by a guarantee from the president of Argentina, promised the funds for a World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine in 1927. In the New York 1927 chess tournament, six of the world's strongest masters played each other four times, the others being Alekhine, Rudolf Spielmann, Milan Vidmar, Nimzovich and Marshall, lacking Bogolyubov and Lasker. Before the tournament, Capablanca diffidently wrote that he had \"more experience but less power\" than in 1911, that he had peaked in 1919 and that some of his competitors had become stronger in the meantime. In the event, he finished undefeated, winning the mini-matches with each of his rivals, 2\u00bd points ahead of second-place Alekhine, and won the \"best game\" prize for a win over Spielmann.\nLosing the title.\nSince Capablanca had won the New York 1927 tournament overwhelmingly, and had never lost a game to Alekhine, he was regarded by most pundits as the clear favorite in their 1927 World Chess Championship match. However, Alekhine won the match, played at Buenos Aires, by 6 wins, 3 losses, and 25 draws \u2013 the longest World Championship match until the World Chess Championship 1984\u201385 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov. Alekhine's victory surprised almost the entire chess world.\nAfter Capablanca's death, Alekhine expressed surprise at his own victory, since in 1927 he had not thought he was superior to Capablanca, and he suggested that Capablanca had been over-confident. Capablanca entered the match with no technical or physical preparation, while Alekhine got himself into good physical condition, and had thoroughly studied Capablanca's play. According to Kasparov, Alekhine's research uncovered many small inaccuracies, which occurred because Capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely. Vladimir Kramnik commented that this was the first contest in which Capablanca had no easy wins. Lud\u011bk Pachman suggested that Capablanca, who was unused to losing games or to any other type of setback, became depressed over his unnecessary loss of the eleventh game, a long, gruelling endgame, featuring errors by both players.\nImmediately after winning the match, Alekhine announced that he was willing to give Capablanca a return match, on the same terms that Capablanca had required as champion \u2013 the challenger must provide a stake of US$10,000, of which more than half would go to the defending champion even if he was defeated.\nNegotiations for a return match dragged on for several years, often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight. Their relationship became bitter, and Alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which Capablanca also played.\nLater life.\nCapablanca finished fourth, one \u00a0point behind the joint winners at Moscow in 1935; Emanuel Lasker's third place at the age of 66 was widely admired. The following year, Capablanca won an even stronger tournament in Moscow, one point ahead of Botvinnik and 3\u00bd ahead of Salo Flohr, who took third place; A month later, he shared first place with Botvinnik at Nottingham, with a mark of (+5 -1 =8), losing only to Flohr; Alekhine came sixth. These 1936 tournaments, the last of Lasker's life, were the only ones in which Capablanca finished ahead of Lasker.\nDuring these triumphs Capablanca began to experience debilitating symptoms of hypertension. and could only finish seventh of the eight players at the 1938 AVRO tournament, an \u00e9lite contest designed to select a challenger for Alekhine's world title. Capablanca's high blood pressure was not correctly diagnosed and treated until after the AVRO tournament, and caused him to lose his train of thought towards the end of playing sessions."}

It happened in September 480 BC in the straits between the mainland and Salamis Island. It was part of the Greco-Persian Wars.\nAlthough heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were persuaded by the Athenian general Themistocles to bring the Persian fleet to battle again. The Persian king Xerxes was also anxious for a decisive battle.\nThe Persian navy sailed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships.\nAs a result, Xerxes retreated to Asia with much of his army, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, the rest of the Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. Afterwards the Persians made no more attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea mark a turning point in the Greco-Persian wars; from then on, the Greek cities would take the offensive."}

It has a wide distribution in Eurasia and north Africa.\nThe adult male sparrowhawk has a blue-grey back and wings. His chest and belly have thin orange stripes. Female and young sparrowhawks have brown backs and wings, with thin brown stripes. The female is up to 25% larger than the male. This is one of the biggest size differences in any bird species.\nThe sparrowhawk eats mostly small birds which live in woodland. It can be seen in any habitat and often hunts birds in town and city gardens. Male sparrowhawks eat smaller birds like tits, finches and sparrows. Females eat bigger birds like thrushes and starlings. They can kill birds weighing more than .\nThe sparrowhawk is seen in Europe, parts of Asia and parts of Africa. Birds that breed in the north migrate south for winter. Birds that live further south stay there, or fly shorter distances.\nSparrowhawks build a nest in woodland. The nest is up to 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft) wide and made from twigs. The female lays four or five eggs with pale blue shells. The chicks hatch after 33 days and leave the nest after another 24 to 28 days.\nThe proportion of young sparrowhawks which survive to one year old is 34%. More young males die than young females. 69% of adults survive from one year to the next. The average lifespan is four years.\nThe number of sparrowhawks decreased in Europe in the 1950s. Chemicals to kill unwanted insects (\"pesticides\") were put on seeds before they were planted. Small birds ate the seeds and then sparrowhawks ate the small birds. The amount of chemicals in the food chain increased. This affected the sparrowhawks. Some were poisoned and others laid eggs with shells that were too thin. The shells broke before the chicks hatched. The pesticides were banned and the sparrowhawk population increased again. It is now one of the commonest birds of prey in Europe.\nThe sparrowhawk's hunting behaviour means people who own homing pigeons or keep birds for food may dislike it. Some people also blame the sparrowhawk for decreases in the numbers of smaller birds. Scientists have found that increased numbers of sparrowhawks did not reduce the numbers of birds living in farmland and woodland in the 1960s. Research in Scotland found that less than 1% of homing pigeons that died were killed by sparrowhawks.\nPeople have used the Sparrowhawk for falconry (hunting using a bird of prey) for more than 500 years. It is difficult to train but brave. The sparrowhawk features in some old German myths. It is mentioned in a play by William Shakespeare and a poem by Ted Hughes.\nDescription.\nThe sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short, broad wings and a long tail. These adaptations help it to fly between trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and can be twice as heavy. When females are larger than males, it is called \"reverse sexual dimorphism\". It is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey.\nThe adult male is long from beak to tail, with a wingspan of . He weighs .p158 The male has a slate-grey back and wings (sometimes more blue). His chest and belly have thin red stripes but they can look orange from a distance. His eyes are orange-yellow or orange-red.\nThe female is much larger \u2013 long, with a wingspan of . She weighs . The female has dark brown or grey-brown back and wings, and brown stripes on her chest and belly. Her eyes are bright yellow to orange.\nYoung sparrowhawks have a brown back and wings, with rust-coloured edges to the feathers. They have bigger brown stripes and spots on their chest and belly, and pale yellow eyes.\nThe Sparrowhawk's pale underparts and darker back and wings are an example of countershading. This colouration counteracts the effect of light coming from above, and helps to make the bird less visible. In fact, countershading is seen in most animals, including the Peregrine Falcon, the Merlin and other \"Accipiters\". The Sparrowhawk's stripes are typical of markings on birds of prey which live in woodland.\nSparrowhawks fly in a pattern described as \"flap-flap-glide\". The glide means that the flight has an up-and-down pattern. In Great Britain, Sparrowhawks living further north have longer wings than birds in the south. The sparrowhawk has a small, hooked beak. It is used for removing the feathers of its prey. The sparrowhawk's long legs and toes help it to catch and eat birds. Its middle toe is very long and is used to grab things.\nLifespan.\nMost sparrowhawks live for about four years. 34% of young birds survive to be one year old. 69% of adults survive from one year to the next. The oldest known wild sparrowhawk lived for more than 20 years.\nYoung sparrowhawks (less than one year old) weigh less than adults. They are especially light in the two months after leaving the nest. There is probably a high death rate at this time, particularly for males. This may be because the smaller males catch smaller food. They cannot catch some of the bigger prey that females can. This means they need to eat more often. A female sparrowhawk of average weight can survive for seven days without eating. A male can survive only four days.\nTaxonomy.\nThe sparrowhawk is part of the family Accipitridae and the genus \"Accipiter\". Some English people used to call the sparrowhawk the blue hawk because of the male's colour. Other old names include spar hawk, spur hawk and stone falcon.\nThe Swedish biologist Carolus Linnaeus was the first person to describe the sparrowhawk. He called it \"Falco nisus\" in 1758. The French naturalist Mathurin Jacques Brisson moved it into the \"Accipiter\" genus in 1760.\nThe current scientific name comes from the Latin words \"accipiter\" (hawk) and \"nisus\" (the sparrowhawk).\nThe sparrowhawk forms a superspecies with the rufous-chested sparrowhawk of eastern and southern Africa, and possibly the Madagascar sparrowhawk. Eurasian sparrowhawks look slightly different in different parts of their range. Birds in the eastern part of the range are larger and paler. Six subspecies of sparrowhawk are generally recognised:"}

It was first published in three volumes by Joseph Johnson of London in 1801, and was later printed again by Pandora Press in 1986. The book was Edgeworth's second published. The book was noted for showing interracial marriage.\nMain characters.\nLady Delacour is a \"bel esprit\" (woman of wit), who Belinda at first thinks \u201cthe most agreeable\u2014no, that is too feeble an expression\u2014the most fascinating person she had ever beheld (known).\u201d Later, however, after Belinda hears about her sad life, she feels sorry for her. Belinda is very kind to Lady Delacour, who begins to like her. Through Belinda's gentleness, Lady Delacour begins to change. She becomes more caring for her husband and daughter Helena. However, Lady Delacour's sudden untrue jealousy towards Belinda and makes her move to the Percivals' house, where Helena is staying at. Later, Lady Delacour finds out that she was completely wrong and had misunderstood Belinda's good intentions. She becomes very ill, and begs for Belinda to forgiver her and come back. Belinda, accepting her apology, comes, and now Lady Delacour does everything Belinda advises her to do, and makes up with her husband, revealing to him how she is ill, that she had been hiding from everybody except herself and Belinda and her maid. Lord Delacour feels worried for her when he hears this. She takes a surgery, and is told that she is actually not ill at all. The bad doctor she had been going to had given her the wrong medicines, and therefore made her sick. Joyfully, she decides to be a good wife, a sweet friend, and a kind mother. She ends the book by saying, while laughing, \u201cNow, Lady Delacour, to show that she is reformed, comes forward to address the audience with a moral\u2014a moral!\u2014yes,\nOur tale contains a moral, and no doubt,\nYou all have wit enough to find it out.\u201d\nHer strong character and the very important part she plays in the book make some people think the title should be her name instead of Belinda's.\nBelinda Portman is a young lady. She is about seventeen years old. She is \u201chandsome, graceful, sprightly, and highly accomplished.\u201d She has good skills, but is unused to thinking for herself, for her aunt orders her to do everything(though her thoughts are often very different). Belinda is innocent and loving, and loves Clarence Hervey, though she does not even admit it to herself. Mr. Vincent and Sir Philip both want to marry her. She is very forgiving, as seen when she forgives Lady Delacour, but has good self-control over her feelings \u2013 for example, she does not blush (turns red) later when people talk about Clarence Hervey, and is not shaken by Mrs. Freke when she said she would be her enemy.\nClarence Hervey is a clever and witty young man, who is gallant, and is, as Belinda said at first, \u201ca most uncommonly pleasing young man.\u201d He is shown to have a warm heart, for he asks Lady Delacour to make his peace with Belinda after he spoke badly about her. He admires Lady Delacour, and tries to change her. But after that, he begins to like Belinda. However, he had been secretly taking care of another girl, Virginia, and now, thinking that he must marry Virginia, he tries to forget about Belinda. But later, Virginia shows him that she loves somebody else. So he tells Belinda that he loves her, and they marry.\nLady Anne Percival is very different from Lady Delacour. She is a gentle, motherly, reasonable lady. Belinda later also tells Mr. Vincent, when he compares Lady Anne Percival and Lady Delacour, \u201cI have never seen any woman who would not suffer by a comparison with Lady Anne Percival.\u201d She loves literature, and that makes her a good wife to Mr. Percival. She is kind and motherly, and loves Helena like her daughter. She also treats Belinda kindly, and thinks carefully before she judges people. She wished for Belinda to marry Mr. Vincent. At first, Lady Delacour did not like her, feeling jealous and thinking that Helena liked Lady Anne Percival better than her. However, later at the end, it is guessed that she becomes good friends with Lady Anne Percival."}

The Axolotl shows neoteny: the larvae do not undergo metamorphosis, so the adults stay aquatic, with external gills. \nNatural history.\nThe species evolved in the lake underlying Mexico City. Axolotls are used a lot in scientific research because they can regenerate most body parts, are easy to breed, and have large embryos. \nAxolotls are closely related to waterdogs, the larval stage of the closely related Tiger salamanders \"Ambystoma tigrinum\" and \"Ambystoma mavortium\". These are common in much of North America and also sometimes become neotenic. The mudpuppies, \"Necturus\", are fully-aquatic salamanders which are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance.\nWild axolotls are now near extinction due to population growth in Mexico City, and the polluted waters of the lake. Non-native fish, such as African tilapia and Asian carp, have also recently been introduced to the waters. These new fish have been eating the axolotls' young, as well as its primary source of food. The axolotl is currently on the IUCN Red List of threatened species.\nGenetics and development.\nCompared with land-dwelling salamanders, the sexually mature adult Axolotl is a chimera (~ mixture) of larval and adult tissues.

Poison gases can kill or injure a person if present in a high enough concentration. There is a diverse range of different poison gases and each has unique properties. Many toxic liquids are also volatile and their vapors are poison gas. \"Poison gas\" can refer to poisons in chemical weapons, but most of them are in fact liquids, for example mustard gas and VX are viscous liquids that are dispersed into fine mists.\nIn small amounts, corrosive poison gases usually cause irritation, and may have a smell, but this is not universal. There are several gases that can kill insidiously, without a warning smell or irritation.\nAll gases other than oxygen can displace air, and cause death by asphyxiation. This does not make them poison gases. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are two common examples. This has to be taken into account in handling of any compressed or liquified gas. Gases can be also dangerous because they are flammable (easily bursting into flame).\nPoison gases can cause injury more easily than solid or liquid poisons because they diffuse (move) in the air, exposing skin, and are easily breathed in. Immediate contact with corrosive gas leads to chemical burns of the skin and lungs. When absorbed into the inside of the human body and into the blood, either by breathing in or through skin, several poison gases cause a poisoning. In a poisoning, medical help is often necessary; simply removing the victim from the gas is not enough to prevent symptoms.\nPoison gases are used in industry as chemical reagents. The chemical reactions they can be used for are more important than their toxicity. Today, chemists try to avoid the use of poisonous gases, but it is often not possible. Examples of large-volume industrial poisonous gases are hydrogen sulfide, cracked from oil, chlorine, in diverse chemical uses and to disinfect drinking water, and ammonia, which is a valuable fertilizer into itself and can be converted into a range of other fertilizers, in addition to chemical uses.\nSome fumigants (chemicals used to kill pests) are also poison gases, for example phosphine, which is used to kill pests living in grains. The advantage of a gas is that it evaporates after use, so that if food is treated with gas, there is no need to rinse it to remove the poison. Some gasses can kill you and some can\u2019t. Gasses have advantages and disadvantages. "}

Its relative minor is B minor.\nD major is good for violin music because of the structure of the instrument, which has its four strings tuned to G D A E. The open strings resonate with the D string, producing a special rich sound.\nBecause of this, many classical composers chose to write violin concertos in D major. Examples include Mozart's (No. 2, 1775, No. 4, 1775); Ludwig van Beethoven's (1806); Paganini's (No. 1, 1817); Brahms's (1878); Tchaikovsky's (1878); Prokofiev's (No. 1, 1917); Stravinsky's (1931); and Korngold's (1945).\nIt is also suitable for guitar music, with drop tuning for the lowest string making two Ds as open strings.\nFor some beginning wind instrument students, however, D major is not a very good key, because it transposes to E major for B flat instruments. E major has four sharps, which is harder for new learners to play.\nStill, the clarinet in B-flat is often used for music in D major. It is probably the key with the most sharps that it can play well. However, when some composers write a piece in D minor with B-flat clarinets, they change to clarinets in A if the music changes to D major.\nMost tin whistles are in D, because they are often used in music with fiddles.\nIn the Baroque period, D major was seen as \"the key of glory\"; so many trumpet pieces were in D major. Examples include concertos by Fasch, Gross, Molter (No. 2), Leopold Mozart, Telemann (No. 2), and Giuseppe Torelli; sonatas by Corelli, Franceschini, Purcell, Torelli; and \"The Trumpet Shall Sound\" and the \"Hallelujah\" chorus from Handel's \"Messiah\".\nAfter the valve trumpet was invented, composers began to write for trumpet in keys with more flats, so Haydn wrote his famous trumpet concerto in the key of E-flat major.\n23 of Haydn's 104 symphonies are in D major, making it the most often used main key of his symphonies. A great number of Mozart's unnumbered symphonies are in D major, namely K. 66c, 81/73, 97/73m, 95/73n, 120/111a and 161/163/141a. The symphony came from the overture, and \"D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century.\"\nScriabin saw D major as golden in color and when he talked to Rimsky-Korsakov, he gave an example from one of Rimsky-Korsakov's own operas where a character sang in D major about gold."}
