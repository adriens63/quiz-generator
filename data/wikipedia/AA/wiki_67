{"id": "239840", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239840", "title": "Susan Polgar", "text": "Susan Polgar (born 19 April 1969 as \"Polg\u00e1r Zsuzsanna\" and often known as \"Zsuzsa Polg\u00e1r\") is a Hungarian-American chess player.\nAt 15, she was the top-ranked woman player in the world. She was the Women's World Chess Champion from 1996 to 1999. In October 2005 Polgar had a FIDE rating of 2577, making her the second-ranked woman in the world at the time, after her sister Judit Polg\u00e1r. She has been inactive and has not played in official competition since 2004.\nPolgar is head of the Susan Polgar Institute for Chess Excellence at Texas Tech University, and a chess writer and promoter. She had been on the Executive of the United States Chess Federation, but was stripped of her membership after a complicated internal struggle.\nSusan was born and brought up in Budapest, Hungary, and now lives in Lubbock, Texas. She recently moved from Forest Hills, Queens in New York City, where she ran the Polgar Chess Center and the Susan Polgar Foundation, which gives chess training to children, especially girls.\nChess career.\nPolgar and her two younger sisters, Judit and Sofia, were part of an educational experiment carried out by their father L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Polg\u00e1r. He and his wife Klara educated their three daughters at home, with chess as the specialist subject.\nIn January 1991, Polgar became the third woman to earn the Grandmaster title. Much is made, by her supporters, of the fact that Polgar had got the three GM norms and a rating over 2500. Nona Gaprindashvili was awarded the Grandmaster title in 1978 mainly as a result of winning Lone Pine International 1977, but she did not quite make the usual 24 games required at that time. Maia Chiburdanidze was awarded the GM title in 1984 for winning at New Delhi (1984), and for beating Nona Gaprindashvili and two others in matches for the Women's World Chess Championship. However, before Polgar reached the title, Chiburdanidze had more than achieved the traditional GM qualifications by her performances at Banja Luka and Bilbao.\nPolgar had tended to avoid women-only tournaments, but she abandoned this when she entered the 1993 cycle for the Women's World Championship. She became the Women's World Champion at her second attempt in 1996. Two years later, her title defense against Xie Jun of China was scheduled to take place in November, 1998. However, Polgar requested a postponement because she was pregnant and also FIDE had been unable to find a satisfactory sponsor. Ultimately, in 1999, a match was arranged, but under conditions to which Polgar objected \u2013 firstly because she had recently had a child, and had not had sufficient time to recuperate, and secondly because the match was to be held entirely in China, the home country of her challenger. She also wanted a significantly larger prize fund.\nWhen Polgar refused to play under these conditions, FIDE declared that she had forfeited the title, and instead organized a match between Xie Jun and Alisa Galliamova for the Women's World Chess Championship, which was won by Xie Jun. Polgar sued in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland for monetary damages and the restoration of her title. In March 2001, the case was settled, with Polgar withdrawing her claims and FIDE agreeing to pay Polgar's attorney's fees in the amount of $25,000. Since Xie Jun had already been crowned Women's World Champion, FIDE could not restore the title to Polgar. Polgar has not participated in subsequent Women's World Championship cycles.\nPaid substantial appearance fees by the Hungarian Chess Federation,p106 the family did play together in two female-only events. The Hungarians (nicknamed 'Polgaria') won the Women's Chess Olympiads, with a team packed with Polg\u00e1rs, in 1988 and 1990.p106; 156 Zsuzsa, Judit, Sofia (the least strong sister) and Ildiko Madl were the team which pushed the Soviet Union into second place for the first time.\nAmerican career.\nThe United States Chess Federation named Polgar \"Grandmaster of the Year\" in 2003, the first time a woman has won that honor. In that same year (2003), Polgar also became the first woman to win the US Open Blitz Championship, against a field which included seven grandmasters. She won that title again in 2005 and in 2006.\nShe helped train and played the top board for the United States women's team at the 2004 Chess Olympiad held in October in Majorca, Spain. Overall, the team won the silver medal, and Polgar won an individual gold medal. This was not her first Olympiad: she has a total of ten Olympiad Medals (five Gold, four Silver, and one Bronze). She has played 56 games in the Olympiads, never losing a single game.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1994, Polgar married computer consultant Jacob Shutzman, and moved to New York. They had two sons, Tom and Leeam, but later divorced. In December 2006, she married her longtime business manager and friend, Paul Truong.\nAuthor.\nPolgar has written several books:\nPolgar is also a chess journalist, with columns in \"Chess Life\", \"Chess Life for Kids\", \"ChessCafe\", \"Chess Horizons\", \"Georgia Chess\", \"Chessville\", \"Empire Chess\", \"School Mates\", and \"Europe Echecs\"."}

It is a reusable robotic spacecraft based on the smaller X-40. The X-37 began as a NASA project in 1999, then was transferred to the US Department of Defense in 2004. The X-37 had its first flight as a drop test in April 2006 at Edwards AFB. The spacecraft was launched in April 2010 to begin a United States Air Force mission.\nHistory.\nIn 1999, NASA chose Boeing to design the vehicle. The vehicle was built at the California branch of Boeing's Phantom Works. At the end of 2002, a new $300 million contract was awarded to Boeing in the framework of NASA\u2019s Space Launch Initiative.\nThe X-37 was transferred from NASA to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in September, 2004. The program has become a secretive, though it is not known whether DARPA will maintain this status for the project.\nIn June 2005, the X-37 completed a captive-carry flight underneath the White Knight at Mojave Spaceport, Mojave, California. Through the second half of 2005, the X-37 underwent structural upgrades including reinforcement of the nose wheel supports. Further captive-carry flight tests and the first drop test were expected mid-February 2006.\nMarch 2006 was scheduled for the X-37's first free flight but a snow storm covered the area, dropping snow on the Mojave. The next flight attempt in March was canceled due to high winds. In late March the X-37 flew, but a flaw prevented the free flight and the vehicle returned to the ground still docked with its White Knight carrier. In April 2006, the X-37 made its first free glide flight. During landing the vehicle ran off the runway. After the vehicle was repaired, the program moved from Mojave to Air Force Plant 42 (KPMD) in Palmdale, California for the remainder of the flight test program. White Knight continued to be based at Mojave, but would ferry over to Plant 42 when flights were scheduled. Five additional flights were performed, at least one of which is believed to have been a free flight with a successful landing.\nIn November 2006 the U.S. Air Force announced it would develop the X-37B from the NASA X-37A. The Air Force version is designated X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV). The OTV program builds on industry and government investments by DARPA, NASA and the Air Force. The X-37B effort will be led by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and includes partnerships with NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Boeing is the prime contractor for the OTV program. The X-37B can remain in orbit for up to 270 days at a time.\nThe Secretary of the Air Force states the OTV program will focus on \"risk reduction, experimentation, and operational concept development for reusable space vehicle technologies, in support of long term developmental space objectives.\"\nThe X-37B was originally scheduled for launch in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, but following the \"Columbia\" accident, it was transferred to a Delta II. It was then transferred to the Atlas V following concerns over the spacecraft's aerodynamic properties during launch.\nDesign.\nThe main engines are fueled by JP-8 kerosene, a military standard jet fuel. The maneuvering engines are fueled by hydrogen peroxide. This is wrong, the propellants were changed to hypergols long ago when it was a NASA program.\nThe X-37 was originally designed to be carried into orbit in the Space Shuttle cargo bay, but underwent redesign to launch on Atlas V and Falcon 9 after it was determined that a shuttle flight would be uneconomical.\nThis vehicle has the potential to become the United States' first operational military spaceplane, after the cancellation of Dyna-Soar in 1963. It is expected to operate in a velocity range of up to Mach 25 on reentry. Among the technologies to be demonstrated with the X-37 are improved thermal protection systems, avionics, the autonomous guidance system, and an advanced airframe. The on-board engine is the Rocketdyne AR-2/3, which is fueled by hydrogen peroxide and JP-8.\nThe X-37's aerodynamic design was derived from the Space Shuttle, hence the X-37 has a similar lift-to-drag ratio, and a lower cross range at high altitudes and mach numbers than the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle.\nThe test vehicle, which was used as an atmospheric drop test glider, had no propulsion system. Instead of an operational vehicle's payload bay doors it had an enclosed and reinforced upper fuselage structure to allow it to be mated with a mothership. Most of the thermal protection tiles were 'fake', made of inexpensive foam rather than ceramic; a smaller number of the X-37's tiles were actual TPS tiles, and TPS blankets were used in areas where heating would not have been severe enough to require tiles.\nFollowing their missions, X-37B spacecraft are to land on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California with Edwards Air Force Base as an alternate site."}

The first barcodes stored the numbers using lines (bars).\nThe first use of barcodes was to label railroad rolling stock. They became a big success when they were used in supermarket checkout systems. The first product that used a barcode was a pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Gum sold on June 26, 1974. It was invented by IBM engineer George J. Laurer. Barcodes are now used for many purposes.\nHistory.\nNorman Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver developed the modern barcode, and were granted a patent for it in 1952. The idea was to make the checkout of articles easier, using a code which was inspired by Morse code. In 1959, David Collins developed a system for tracking railroad carriages which used barcodes. This system was unreliable, because of dirt on the barcodes. In the 1970s, the system was abandoned, but in the 1980s, a similar system which used radio tags was introduced.\nDesign.\nThere are different barcode types, which use different designs:\nThe standard barcode uses changes in lines and spaces to store numbers in a code that computers can read. The lines are read by a scanner and changed into numbers. It is designed that it can be read forwards or backwards, so the user does not have to be careful how a product is put in front of the reader. A laser line can be used to scan (read) the changes. The laser scanners are also called barcode readers. Since this laser line scans in one direction (left or right), this is called a 1D barcode.\nNewer 2D systems use symbols other than bars and can hold more information, but they are also called barcodes. They need to be scanned left or right, and up or down (two directions). QR codes were invented in 1994 to use in factories to track parts and products. People use them for many purposes in the 21st century. Special software can read QR from an image. Smartphones can have an app to show and read them. This is becoming increasingly popular as more apps are able to use such features to help the user obtain access to websites and special resources, such as being used in 'digital cities', such as Bordeaux. Many kinds of tickets, including those for transport, have a QR code.\nUses.\nBarcodes \u2014 especially the Universal Product Code, UPC \u2014 have slowly become an important part of modern life. They are used in many places, and the technology is constantly improving. Some modern uses of barcodes are:\nBenefits.\nIn sales, the use of barcodes can provide up-to-date information to help the business. For example:"}

As a consequence, they have been reduced to a small minority, who have survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII.\nData.\nAccording to the Italian Census done in 1936, in the peninsula of Istria there were 294,000 residents; most were Istrian Italians. Here, there are the percentages for all the Istrian cities/districts:\nCurrently, there are nearly 50,000 Istrian Italians; a small minority of the Istria peninsula population. They are mainly divided between Croatia and Slovenia, but a few thousand still live in Italy (in the coastal city of Muggia near Trieste).\nIndeed, in various municipalities in actual Croatia and Slovenia, census data shows that there are still significant numbers of Italians living in Istria, such as 51% of the population of Gro\u017enjan/Grisignana, 37% at Brtonigla/Verteneglio and nearly 30% in Buje/Buie."}

In his 'Classification of Design' (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes; design management operates in and across all three categories:\nDesign management is not independent from the organization and product context, and plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organisation and market:\nSupportive activities are used in design management to manage design more efficient ('doing the things right') and effectively ('doing the right things'). Depending on a multitude of factors (such as industry, company size, design focus, market situation and the position / role of design within the company), design managers have a broad range of job profiles, with very different roles, activities and responsibilities.\nHistorical development.\nIt is difficult to exactly trace the history of design management. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created the context in which design management could arise. Throughout its history design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines (e.g. architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering) and movements (e.g. system theory, design methodologies) and in its understanding it can be attributed neither directly to design nor to management.\nHistorical development of design management: \nDesign Management Hierarchy.\nDesign management can be divided by its different fields of application into the three different levels: \nFurther reading.\nBooks"}

{"id": "240226", "revid": "628955", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240226", "title": "Middlegame", "text": "The middlegame is the part of a game of chess after the opening.\nThe middlegame begins when most of the pieces have been developed. It is where most games are won and lost. Many games will end in resignation even before an endgame takes place.&lt;ref name=\"H/W\"&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe simplest way to learn the middlegame is to select an opening and learn it well (see examples in English opening and French defence).\nElements of structure.\nA middlegame position has a structure, caused by the opening. These are some things to look for when looking at a middlegame position:\n\u2022 Material: changes in the balance of material are critical. To lose a piece for nothing is enough to lose a game. If the players are evenly matched, then a rough material balance of pieces is normal. Material balance is often quite static: it doesn't change for many moves. On the other hand, material may be sacrificed, usually for a direct attack on the opposing king.\n\u2022 Development: the opening may have left one player with a lead in development. That player has the initiative, and may attack before the opponent can get his pieces out. It is a temporary asset: if a lead in development is not used effectively, it will disappear.\n\u2022 The centre: in the centre pieces have their greatest effect, and some (such as the knight) attack more squares in the centre than at the sides. The player who controls the centre will almost always have the advantage.\n\u2022 Mobility: a position is mobile if the pieces can get where they need to. Almost all middle game positions have some limitations to mobility. Look for open files for the rooks, and open diagonals for the bishops. Outposts are what knights need, places where they can't easily be dislodged.\n\u2022 King safety: where is the king? Ideally, a king should be castled, and kept behind a screen of pawns. Many other things may happen in practice. If a king is weak, it may be put under direct attack. If the kings castle on opposite wings, and queens are on the board, both players may try to assault the enemy king.\n\u2022 Pawns provide the skeleton of a position. They move slowly, and may become blocked for many moves. Everything takes place round the pawns. Different openings produce different pawn structures. In this way openings influence the whole game. Notice these things when they occur:\nWhat the player does is note the features on the board, and formulate a plan which takes the features into account. Then the player works out a sequence of moves. Of course, in practice, the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step!\nMiddlegame types.\nCentral struggles.\nIsolated Queen's pawn.\nThe Tarrasch variation of the French defence gives us: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5 (3...Nf6 is popular) 4.exd5 exd5 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.0-0 Ne7 9.Nb3 Bd6 10.Re1 0-0 11.Bg5 Bg4 and so on. Now the opening is over, and all the pieces are developed. This line is quiet, and mostly about the centre.\nThe isolated black QP is what gives the middlegame its character. The pawn itself is both a weakness and a potential source of strength. It controls the very important square e4, but leaves the equally important d4 much weaker. The position is fairly equal, but the database shows that White has an advantage of about 7%.\nRapid development.\nIn the English opening this line became popular: 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4 c5 4.e5 Ng8 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.d4 (this is the critical move: White tries to take advantage of his development at the expense of a pawn) 6...cxd4 7.Nxd4 Nxe5 8.Ndb5 a6 9.Nd6+ Bxd6 10.Qxd6 f6 11.Be3 Ne7 12. Bb6 (looks like it wins the Q) Nf5 and now both 11.Qc5 and 11.Bxd8 give White an advantage of only 2.4%.\nThe variation involved a number of middlegame themes: rapid development, material sacrifice, exploiting weak squares. In total, it is a frantic struggle for the centre.\nRapid development is the benefit of the old-style gambits. An opening such as 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 (known as the Danish Gambit) is virtually never played nowadays, but White does get good value for his pawn(s). Some trainers recommend young players try this out to learn how to get the best out of rapid development.\nCentral pawn chains.\nMany middlegames are played around blocked or semi-blocked pawn chains. The pawn chains are decisive in deciding the players' plans. These plans often involve a K-side v Q-side struggle, with each player attacking his opponent's pawn base.\nFrench defence structures.\n1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 Qc7 (7...0-0 is possible) 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Ne2 and so on. The play in lines like this is strongly asymmetric: White owns the kingside, and Black owns the queenside.\nThis example, from the Winawer variation, is an extreme case. Each side plays a maximum of moves attacking the opponent's weak side, and as few moves as possible defending his own weak side. This is a general principle for these unbalanced K-side v Q-side positions.\nKing's Indian structures.\nHere is an example from the borderline between opening and middlegame. In the diagram to the left, White will operate mainly on the Q-side, and Black on the K-side. The reason for this is that the black d6 pawn and the white e4 pawn are the bases of their pawn chains. It was Nimzovich who pointed out that such pawns are usually the most vulnerable to attack.\nWhite, to play, may wish to cope with Black playing 10...Nf4. He can do this by playing 10.g3, or by playing 10.Re1 so that if 10...Nf4 11.Bf1 will preserve the bishop (in this position an important defensive piece). Or maybe White will plough ahead with 10.c5, the key move on the Q-side. \nChessBase shows that the number of tournament games with these choices were:\nThe data base also shows that the overall results were significantly better for 10.Re1. What the player does is note the features on the board, and formulate a plan which takes the features into account. Then the player works out a sequence of moves. Of course, in practice, the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step!\nSafety of the king.\nSafety of the king is probably the most common theme in the later middlegame. This example is a classic. Two pawns up, White could win the endgame by exchanging queens. However, he thought he saw something better.\nThis is a skewer, because if the black queen moves aside, then Rxg7+ gives mate.\nThis brilliant reply puts its finger on White's weak point: the back rank.\nValue of the pieces.\nTraditionally the value of the Pieces has been as follows:\nKasparov's version:"}

A DVD/VHS combo can record (write) on VHS tapes, read off VHS tapes, and additionally, read from DVD discs. A few can also record on DVD. VHS was so popular that during the 1990s, the terms \"videocassette\", \"videotape\", or even just \"video\" usually referred to the VHS format.\nVHS cassettes can be recorded using a video camera. They can also be recorded with a videocassette recorder, or VCR. A VCR can use a VHS cassette to record broadcast television.\nThis system was created in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan (also called JVC). VHS was a very popular way for people to record and play video at home in the 1980s and 1990s, but now DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) and Blu-ray have become more popular as they can be easier to use, the quality is higher, they last longer, and the discs and players are cheaper to make. VHS VCRs, as well as blank tapes and pre-recorded VHS movies, are no longer made, except for a few independent films. Blank tapes are still widely available as new old stock.\nHistory.\nBefore VHS.\nMany companies developed different systems for recording video on a tape cassette, but the first VTR (short for Video Tape Recorder) to become popular and make money was the Ampex VRX-1000, which was introduced in 1956 by Ampex Corporation. It cost US$50,000 in 1956 (over $400,000 in 2016 money), and US$300 (over $2,000 in 2016 money) for a 90-minute reel of tape. Because it was so expensive, it was made and sold only for professional recording.\nWhile Kenjiro Takayanagi, a television broadcasting pioneer, was the vice president of JVC, he decided that his company could make money by developing and selling VTRs in Japan, and at a lower price. In 1959, JVC developed a two-head video tape recorder, and by 1960 they had a color television version for professional broadcasting. In 1964, JVC released the DV220. It would be the company's standard VTR until the mid-1970s.\nIn 1969, JVC worked with Sony Corporation and Matsushita Electric (who owned Panasonic) to design a video recording technical standard for Japanese consumers. They developed the U-matic tape format in 1971, which was the first format to become a technical standard for VTRs. The U-matic format was successful in business and some video broadcasting. However, few people bought U-matic VTRs to use at home because they were still very expensive, and the tapes could only record short time periods of video.\nSoon after, Sony and Matsushita stopped working on the project. They started to work on their own video recording formats. Sony started working on Betamax and Matsushita started working on VX. JVC released the CR-6060 in 1975, which was based on the U-matic format. Sony and Matsushita also produced their own U-matic machines.\nVHS development.\nIn 1971, JVC engineers named Yuma Shiraishi and Shizuo Takano started a team to develop a VTR for people to use at home.\nBy the end of 1971, they created an diagram titled \"VHS Development Matrix\", which listed goals for JVC's new VTR.\nIn 1972, video recording industry in Japan started to lose money. JVC had to find ways to spend less money, so it stopped developing the VHS project. However, Takano and Shiraishi continued to work on the project by themselves, even though the company was not giving them any money to use. By 1973, the two engineers had built a prototype."}

The people who worked at Boeing called the plane the \"Dash 80\". It was made to show airlines how good jet aircraft were.\nThe Dash 80 was the prototype for the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and the Boeing 707. It was made in less than two years.\nOnly one was made. It is now in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.\nDesign and development.\nTwo things made Boeing think about making a jet airliner. The first reason was because of the Boeing B-47 Stratojet. The second reason was because of the world's first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet.\nIn 1950 Boeing made some details on a jet airliner which they called the \"Model 473-60C\". Airlines were not sure about jet planes because they successful with propeller planes like the Douglas DC-4, DC-6, Boeing Stratocruiser and Lockheed Constellation.\nBoeing had sold a lot of planes to the military but they were not very successful with airlines. Douglas was the most successful airliner maker at the time. Boeing thought that the only way to get airlines to buy a jet plane was to show them one.\nBoeing wanted its jets to have different model numbers from its propeller planes. The names of the propeller planes all started with 300. The numbers 400, 500 and 600 were used by missiles and other things, so Boeing made the model number of the jets 700. The first jet would be the 707.\nThe Dash 80 was wide. Boeing wanted to make the 707's fuselage wide. By the time the 707 was made, its fuselage was in diameter. The decision to change it did not make many delays, because the Dash 80 was mostly made by hand.\nHistory.\nBy early 1952 the Dash 80 was designed and Boeing's managers allowed it to be made. The Dash 80 was made at Boeing's Renton factory.\nThe Dash 80 was finished on May 15, 1954, which was 18 months after the making started.\nSome problems were found with the engines and brakes. The brakes once completely failed when the plane landed, so it went over the runway.\nThe barrel roll.\nPeople from Aircraft Industries Association (AIA) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) came to the 1955 Seafair and Gold Cup Hydroplane Races on August 6, 1955. The Dash 80 was supposed to make a simple flight above them, but the Boeing test pilot did two barrel rolls instead.\nThe next day, the pilot was told never to do it again. However, the pilot said it was completely safe.\nA Boeing test pilot who made the first Boeing 777 flight on June 12, 1994 was told \"No rolls.\"\nUse as a test aircraft.\nAfter the first 707 was made in 1957, the Dash 80 was changed into a test planes for other things. It tested things for the new Boeing 727. To do this, another engine was put in at the back.\nLast flight.\nThe Dash 80 was put in storage in 1969. On May 26, 1972 Boeing gave the Dash 8- to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. For 18 years the plane was in a \"desert boneyard\" in Arizona. Boeing took it back and restored it. The Dash 80's last flight was to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. on August 27, 2003. It was painted in its first ever colours and it was sent to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, which is near Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia."}

There was a Roman bath house at nearby Welwyn. The village was at the junction of two thoroughfares, the Great North Road and another road called Stane Street from St Albans. The route of this road runs across the parish along the path of Robbery Bottom Lane, continuing on as a public bridleway to Datchworth and then Braughing, on its way to another major Roman town, Colchester.\nThomas de Wolvesmere is recorded as having lived here in 1297, and his name may have led to the present name of the village."}

She was the second wife of King James II. Mary was a very firm Catholic. She married James, Duke of York, (the future James II) in 1673. He was the younger brother of Charles II. Mary was not interested in politics. Instead, she was devoted to James, and gave birth to two children who lived to become adults. They were Louise Mary and the Jacobite James Francis Edward Stuart, who became known in history as \"The Old Pretender\".\nMary was born as a princess of the Italian Duchy of Modena. She is mostly remembered for the birth of James Francis Edward. Most of the English people thought he was not really Mary's son. They believed he had been secretly brought into the birth-room in a warming-pan to continue King James II's Catholic rule. The privy council investigation declared that the story was false. However, James Francis Edward's birth was one of the reasons why the Glorious Revolution happened. In the Glorious Revolution, King James II was deposed by his daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange.\nThe \"Queen over the water\"\u2014as Jacobites (followers of James II) called Mary\u2014was exiled to France. She lived with her family in the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which Louis XIV of France had given her. Louis XIV's courtiers liked Mary, but thought James was not interesting. When James died, Mary spent a lot of time with the nuns at the Convent of Chaillot. When James II died in 1701, the Jacobites saw James Francis Edward as king. Because he was too young to rule, Queen Dowager Mary acted as regent until he became 16. Later, \"James III\" was forced to leave France because of the Treaty of Utrecht. This left Mary without any family in France (Princess Louise Mary had died of smallpox). Mary died of breast cancer in 1718. She was kindly remembered by the people in France at that time.\nEarly life (1658 - 1673).\nMary Beatrice d'Este was the older child of Alfonso IV, Duke of Modena and his wife Laura Martinozzi. She was born on 5 October 1658 NS in Modena. Her only sibling, Francesco, became a Duke when his father died in 1662. This was the year Mary became 4. Mary and Francesco's mother Laura was firm with her children. She acted as regent of the duchy until her son grew older. Mary's education was very good. She spoke French and Italian well, and had a knowledge of Latin and, later, English."}

A race riot, which is a type of violent protest, happened in 1930 after a black man was accused of raping a white woman. People from the town burned the man in his jail cell and took his body into the streets. The people also burned down the black business district.\nHowever, Sherman continued to grow, especially when an Army Air Field for pilot training, Perrin Air Force Base, was built there in 1941. Perrin Field was closed in 1971.\nPresent.\nSherman is about 65 miles north of Dallas at the intersection of U.S. Highway 75 and U.S. Highway 82. It has a number of public schools and colleges.

If you only need them to recognise a few words, for example the words \"one, two, three\" etc., then speech recognition software can be very accurate. This is why this feature has started to appear on modern mobile phones. But systems that can recognise any word spoken by any person in any language are still a few years away.\nYou can greatly improve the accuracy of these systems by \"training\" them to recognise just one voice. This is usually done by getting the user to read a short set piece of text into the microphone. The user looks at the text which has been created and corrects any mistakes the software has made. By repeating this a number of times the computer's accuracy increases a great deal."}

It started on June 11, 2009. The players on the show are Geoff, Bridgette, Izzy, Trent, Gwen, Owen, Heather, Le-Shawna, Courtney, Beth, Lindsay, Justin, Harold, Duncan, DJ,\nPlot.\nLike the previous season, much of \"Total Drama Action\" chronicles the events of the eponymous fictional reality shows. The \"Total Drama\" series itself is an \"animated reality television series\", which stars the cast and crew of the fictional series, parodying many aspects of reality television in general.\nAfter last season's winner, Owen (Scott McCord), forgoes his prize money of C$100,000 for a challenge (open to all 22 of \"Total Drama Island\"'s contestants) in which the winner would receive C$1,000,000, the money was left in limbo after a situation resulted in a 14-way tie. As such, show host Chris McLean (Christian Potenza) had no choice but to commission a second competition with all 14 tied contestants. The contestants are told to arrive at an abandoned movie studio lot in Toronto, where the new competition, titled \"Total Drama Action\", would take place. Because of its location, Chris tells the contestants that the challenges would all be in the form of various movie genres. The accommodations of the contestants are handled by Chef Hatchet (Cl\u00e9 Bennett) in a similar manner to how it was handled in the previous season.\nAfter a quick elimination of two contestants, the couple Geoff (Dan Petronijevic) and Bridgette (Kristin Fairlie), a second challenge determined the team captains of the two competing teams: the Screaming Gaffers, headed by Gwen (Megan Fahlenbock), and the Killer Grips, headed by Trent (Scott McCord). From then on, challenges would alternate between \"reward challenges\" where winners would receive a special prize, and \"elimination challenges\" where the losing team would vote off one of its own in an elaborate \"Gilded Chris Ceremony\". The pattern of reducing the contestants down was briefly interrupted on two occasions: once when Izzy (Katie Crown) was reinstated following a voting irregularity where her alter-ego, \"E-Scope\", was voted off, and another time when Courtney (Emilie-Claire Barlow), a contestant who did not originally qualify for \"Total Drama Action\", successfully sued the show. The players eliminated would make the \"walk of shame\" and into the \"Lame-o-sine\", where they leave the movie studio.\nOnce seven contestants were left, the Screaming Gaffers and the Killer Grips were dissolved, and the challenges became individual-oriented in nature. Chris hired Owen as his ringer to sabotage the other contestants and to create drama. Eventually, two contestants were left standing: Beth (Sarah Gadon) and Duncan (Drew Nelson). The Total Drama Action winner was Duncan. Beth wins in the alternate ending.\nTDA Aftermath.\nSprinkled among the episodes (taking the place of reward challenges) is \"TDA Aftermath\", a show-within-a-show hosted by Geoff and Bridgette, commissioned shortly after their eliminations. On \"TDA Aftermath\", Geoff and Bridgette interview eliminated contestants on their \"Total Drama Action\" experiences. They are accompanied by the contestants of \"Total Drama Island\" that did not qualify for \"Total Drama Action\", as well as other previously-eliminated contestants. \"TDA Aftermath\" consisted of various \"never-before-seen footage\" sequences (purportedly taking place during the events of previous episodes), as well as two recurring segments, \"That's Gonna Leave a Mark\" (a segment of the contestants getting badly hurt), and \"Truth or...\" (in which a contestant is interviewed and are hurt if they lie to the hosts or the studio audience).\nWhen the field eventually narrowed down to two contestants, (Beth and Duncan), a final obstacle course challenge would lead the contestants into the Aftermath set, with the first one arriving winning the show's million-dollar grand prize. Unfortunately, Beth and Duncan had sufficiently cooperated enough though the final challenge to arrive at the same time, and what was meant as a season recap became a show in which the winner would be determined. After efforts by the eliminated and nonparticipant contestants to come up with an impartial way of determining the winner all fail, Chris (supposedly leaving on vacation) ultimately returns to the set and has the eliminated (but not the nonparticipant) contestants vote for the winner who was eventually Duncan."}

The dragon's cave under the castle is now a popular tourist stop.\nHistory.\n \nThere are many versions of the folk tale. This is one of them.\nA long, long time ago, when Prince Krak was the ruler of Krak\u00f3w, many young girls kept on being lost, and no one in Krak\u00f3w knew what had happened to them. It turned out that there was an evil dragon living in a big cave under Wawel Hill. The dragon was stealing farm animals and young girls. Prince Krak said: \"The person who kills the dragon will get half of the country and will marry my daughter.\" Many brave soldiers tried to kill the dragon, but none of them could. Finally, a young shoe-maker came up with an idea! He filled a sheep's skin with salt and left it in front of the dragon\u2019s cave. The greedy dragon saw the salt filled sheep and ate it in one bite. Soon he started to feel a burning pain in his stomach. The pain got worse. It burned more and more. Wanting water, he ran to the Vistula River and started to drink fast. He drank and drank but it was still burning. So he continued to drink, until he burst! The city was rid of the mean dragon, and the shoemaker got his prize from the ruler and married his daughter.\nWawel Dragon sculpture by Bronislaw Chromy.\nIn 1970 a statue of the Wawel Dragon was placed in front of the dragon's den.

{"id": "240987", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240987", "title": "3D printing", "text": "3D printing is a way of creating three dimensional (3D) solid objects. 3D printing is done by building up the object layer by layer. Usually, 3D printers use plastic, because it is easier to use and cheaper. Some 3D printers can 3D print with other materials, like metals and ceramics, but they cost too much money for most people.\n3D printers are useful because they can make new objects very fast, and are good at making them very detailed. This means an engineer can test a lot of new designs and not have to wait for someone else to make them. They are also useful for fixing parts made of plastic, and for making toys, figures, and models. There are a lot of people who print 3D objects at home.\nSince 2003, many more materials printers have been sold than before. Also, the cost of 3D printers has gone down.\nHistory.\n1974 David E. H. Jones first wrote about the idea of 3D printing in the journal New Scientist\n1984 Alain Le M\u00e9haut\u00e9 and others filed a patent for stereolithography (a laser-based 3D printer).\n1989: S. Scott Crump developed FDM. It is the technology used by most 3D printers today.\n1992 The first FDM machine was sold in 1992 by S. Scott Crump's company, Stratasys.\n2005 RepRap became the first open source printer project \n2008 Shapeways became the first service that would 3D print an object and send it to customers \n2017 The first 3D printed house that humans could live in was built in Russia \nHow they work.\nModelling.\nThe first step in 3D printing something is to make it on a computer. People do this with CAD (Computer Aided Design) software or a 3D scanner. To design models in CAD, people start with basic shapes, and build from that point. 3D scanners are machines that take lots of measurements of the object and automatically make a model on the computer. They can be very fast, but are also more expensive.CAD models are usually saved on computers as STL files. They are saved as lots of triangles, which saves space on the computer.\nPrinting.\nThere are a lot of different ways that 3D printers work. There are also many different materials that can be used. Every method and material has its advantages and disadvantages.\nThe main things to think about when choosing a machine are usually speed, costs, and color. Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.Typical layers are around 100 \u03bcm thick, or about one tenth the thickness of a human hair. Prints can take anywhere from less than an hour to many days, depending on how complicated and big it is.\nFinishing.\nAfter the machine has finished printing, sometimes people finish the model. This means making small fixes to make it look better. Finishing includes taking off material that the printer placed to support the model. This sometimes can take a lot of time. There are ways to make it quicker, but it is often easiest to remove plastic by hand.\n&lt;br clear=\"all\"&gt;\nUses.\nDIY.\nLots of people are trying to develop cheap 3D printers for people to use at home. Libraries have also started to buy smaller 3D printers so that people can learn about them without having to buy one. Lots of work has been done by DIY communities, as well as schools and hacker communities. By 2017, more people were starting to use 3D printing in their own home for small items such as gears and small decorations.\nMedical.\n3D printing is used to make medical supplies cheaply. People think that the two biggest uses will be making hearing aids and false teeth \nIn March 2014, surgeons in Swansea used 3D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been badly injured in a road accident.\nManufacturing.\nIn 2014, a supercar was made by a Swedish company that utilizes many 3D printed components. Urbee was the first car in the world to have its bodywork and windows 3D printed.\nIn 2015, a Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet flew with 3D printed parts. The United States Air Force has begun to work with 3D printers, and the Israeli Air Force has also purchased a 3D printer to print spare parts.\nFood.\nFood can be 3D printed. Lots of different foods can be printed, like chocolate and candy, and also flat foods such as crackers, pasta, and pizza. NASA is printing food to create less waste and to make food that has all the right nutrients for astronauts. In 2018, Giuseppe Scionti printed a food that was similar to meat.\nGuns.\nIn 2012, Defense Distributed uploaded files to the internet for a 3D printed gun \"that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer\". After Defense Distributed released their plans, people were worried that they may cause problems with gun control A year later, in May 2013, the US State Department asked Defense Distributed to take down the plans, which they did.\nEducation\n3D printing has increased innovation and problem-solving in classrooms. Design students can use it to print prototypes in subjects such as engineering 3D printing; demonstrations of this have already been deployed throughout some institutions around the world.\nHistorical.\nIn the last several years 3D printing has been used to make sure that important things from history are safe. Many museums have bought 3D printers and are making pieces to fix their relics. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum have started using their 3D printers to make replicas to sell in the gift shop. The National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum sell digital versions of their items online, which everyone can 3D print at home."}

Air travel has made travel much faster. Today we can think of going around the world in 24 hours, which was never possible with any other type of transport.\nToday air travel is a normal way to travel, for pleasure, personal need or business. \nAir travel can be broadly put into two groups; domestic flights, and international flights. Air travel within a country are called domestic flights. Most countries have domestic airlines to provide this service. Air travel across the borders of countries are called international flights. Long distance air travel is mostly international."}

It is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals. It is an \"inhibiting\" neurotransmitter. Normally, when a neuron receives an impulse, it will make the signal stronger. In the case where there is an \"inhibiting\" neurotransmitter, the cell will no longer get the impulse, and the signal as a whole will be weakened. \nGABA regulates how much neurons in the central nervous system will be stimulated in humans, and other mammals. It plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. In humans, GABA is also directly responsible for the regulation of muscle tone. In insect species GABA acts only on excitatory nerve receptors.\nEven though chemically it is an amino acid, GABA is rarely referred to as such in the scientific or medical communities. The term \"amino acid,\" used without a qualifier, refers to the alpha amino acids, which GABA is not. GABA is also not incorporated into proteins."}

This action is repeated at a rate referred to as rpm's, revolutions per minute. The way \"rpm's\" are measured varies by the type of motor, and what \"stroke\" that motor is."}

This mineral's metallic lustre and pale-to-normal, brass-yellow colour have earned it the nickname fool's gold because of its resemblance to gold. The term pyrite may also be used for some other sulphides such as copper sulphide.\nHistory.\nPyrite is the most common sulphide mineral. In ancient Roman times, the name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when it was struck against steel. Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy, which was almost certainly a reference to what is now called pyrite.\nBy Georgius Agricola's time, the term had become a generic term for all sulphide minerals.\nPyrite is usually found associated with other sulphides or oxides in quartz veins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds and as a replacement mineral in fossils. Despite being nicknamed fool's gold, pyrite is sometimes found in association with small amounts of gold."}

It is very dangerous and easy to detonate. It was synthesized in 1847 by Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero. Alfred Nobel used it to make one of the most famous explosives in the world during 1867, named dynamite.\nMedical Uses.\nNitroglycerine is also used in some medicines because it is a vasodilator. This means it makes the blood vessels get wider. That makes it easier for blood to flow through them.\nNitroglycerine is used mostly for angina and some heart attacks caused by coronary artery disease. This is a disease that makes the blood vessels that bring blood to the heart get narrower. When the heart does not get enough blood and oxygen, a person can have angina (chest pain) or a heart attack. Taking nitroglycerine makes the blood vessels get wider again, so more blood and oxygen can get to the heart.\nNitroglycerin is sometimes used in emergencies for other medical conditions caused by narrow blood vessels."}

It is in the Chicago neighborhood O'Hare. It is one of the largest airports in both the United States and the world. It is a \"hub\" for both United Airlines (its second largest hub) and American Airlines, meaning that flights from many cities come and go from the airport daily. It gets the most international flights of any American airport not on the East or West Coast.\nThe Federal government of the United States reduces the amount of delayed flights in the airport in order to shift the burden of domestic flights at Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\nUnited Airlines (including United Express) is the largest airline at O'Hare, carrying over 45% of passengers. O'Hare is the second-largest hub for United, after Houston-Bush. American Airlines (including American Eagle) has the second largest operation at O'Hare, carrying 37.08% of passengers. O'Hare is American Airlines' third-largest hub, after Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte-Douglas.\nO'Hare has been voted the \"Best Airport in North America\" for 10 years by two separate sources: Readers of the U.S. Edition of \"Business Traveler Magazine\" (1998\u20132003) and \"Global Traveler Magazine\" (2004\u20132007). Travel and Leisure magazine's 2009 \"America's Favorite Cities\" ranked Chicago's Airport System (O'Hare and Midway) the second-worst for delays, New York City's airport system (JFK, Newark Liberty, and LaGuardia) being the first. O'Hare currently accounts for over a sixth of the nation's total flight cancellations.\nThe O'Hare Airport is 668 feet (204 meters) above sea level.\nIt is operated by the City of Chicago Department of Aviation. Most of O'Hare Airport is in Cook County. However, a section of the southwest part of the airport is in DuPage County. The Cook County portion is located within a section of the city of Chicago contiguously connected to the rest of the city via a narrow strip of land about 200 feet (61 m) wide, running along Foster Ave. from the Des Plaines River to the airport. This land was annexed into the city limits in the 1950s to assure the massive tax revenue associated with the airport being part of the city. The strip is bounded on the north by Rosemont and the south by Schiller Park.\nHistory.\nThe airport was constructed in 1942\u201343. It was made as a manufacturing plant for airplanes during World War II. The site was chosen for its proximity to the city and transportation. The two-million square-foot (180,000 m\u00b2) factory needed easy access to the workforce of the nation's then-second-largest city, as well as its extensive railroad infrastructure. Orchard Place was a small nearby farming community.\nDouglas Company's contract ended in 1945 and though plans were proposed to build commercial aircraft, the company ultimately chose to concentrate production on the west coast. With the departure of Douglas, the airport took the name Orchard Field Airport. That was the source of its three-letter IATA code ORD.\nIn 1945, the facility was chosen by the city of Chicago as the site for a facility to meet future aviation demands. Matthew Laflin Rockwell (1915\u20131988) was the director of planning for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and responsible for the site selection and design of O'Hare International Airport. He was the great grandson of Matthew Laflin, a founder and pioneer of Chicago. The architect of the airport was Gertrude Kerbis.\nThe O'Hare is currently undergoing the largest construction projects in the United States.\nIn March 2014, a Blue Line train was derailed and crashed at the O'Hare train station, injuring 32 people.\nAccidents.\n1057 deaths have happened as a result of accidents to or from Chicago O'Hare.\nAirlines.\nThe following airlines fly to O'Hare International Airport:\nThe following airlines used to fly to O'Hare International Airport:"}

For Gandhi, \"Satyagraha\" went far beyond just \"passive resistance\" (resisting without taking action) according to him it was a moral force born of truth and non-violence. His non-violence also became his strength. He said that he chose the name because Truth means Love, and Insistence means Force, and the Sanskrit name showed it was a force born from Truth and Love (non-violence).\nHe also wrote that he liked the term \"Civil Resistance\" better than \"Civil disobedience\".

Only 9 genera (about 100 species) of cycads are found to be extant nowadays. Cycads are thought to have evolved from order Pteridospermae (seed ferns) of angiosperms, now totally extinct.\nThey are different from most plants because they have large crowns of compound leaves and a stout trunk. They are evergreen, dioecious plants having large pinnately compound leaves. \nThey are frequently confused with and mistaken for palms or ferns, but are only distantly related to both, and instead belong to the division Cycadophyta.\nCycads are gymnosperms (naked seeded). Their unfertilized seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination. This contrasts with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds and more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle. \nThey have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with various cyanobacteria living in the roots (the \"coralloid\" roots). \nThese photosynthetic cyanobacteria produce a neurotoxin called BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a human food chain if the cycad seeds are eaten, and may cause some neurological diseases."}

Pluto is the ninth largest body that moves around the Sun. Upon first being discovered, Pluto was considered a planet, but was reclassified to a dwarf planet in 2006. It is the largest body in the Kuiper belt.\nLike other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice. It is quite small. It is about a fifth (\u2155) of the weight of the Earth's Moon. It is only a third (\u2153) of its volume. Pluto is very far from the Sun, so its temperature is very low. The average temperature on Pluto is -226 to -240 degrees Celsius. It has an odd orbit and this orbit is very sloped. It takes Pluto to 30 to 49\u00a0AU (4.4\u20137.4 billion\u00a0km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than Neptune.\nSince it was discovered in 1930, Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 1970s, the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small size.\nLater, in the early 21st century, the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered. Eris was initially believed to be 27% larger than Pluto, but was later found to be slightly smaller. On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gave a definition to the word \"planet\" for the first time. By this definition, Pluto was not a planet anymore. It became a \"dwarf planet\" along with Eris and Ceres. After this, Pluto was put on the list of minor planets and was downgraded in 2006 by astronomer Michael E Brown. It was given the number 134340. Some scientists still think that Pluto should be classified as a planet.\nDiscovery.\nIn the 1840s, using Newtonian mechanics, Urbain Le Verrier predicted the planet Neptune existed. He discovered this after studying the orbit of Uranus. Neptune was seen later in the late 19th century. Astronomers then felt that another planet was disturbing Uranus's orbit. In 1906, Percival Lowell, a person from Boston began an extensive to search the ninth planet. He called it \"Planet X\". By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested many possible places in the Solar System where the planet could be. Lowell continued the research till 1916. However, it fetched no good result. On March 19, 1915, his observatory had captured two images of Pluto. Lowell did not know this. The pictures were not recognized then for what they were.\nConstance Lowell, Percival's widow had a ten-year long legal battle for Percival's estate. For this reason, the search for Planet X again started in 1929. The director of the mission, Vesto Melvin Slipher, gave the job to Clyde Tombaugh, a 23-year-old Kansas man. Tombaugh had just come at the Lowell Observatory. Slipher had been impressed by his astronomical drawings.\nTombaugh's had to systematically get pictures of the night sky in pairs every two weeks. Then, he had to look at each pair, to see whether any object had shifted. He used a machine called a blink comparator. He quickly shifted between the different views of each of the plates. This helped him to see whether any object had changed their position. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered an object which seemed to move from the photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of the year. Another picture taken on January 21 confirmed this. After the observatory did more research about it, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.\nName.\nThe discovery made headlines across the Earth. The Lowell Observatory had the right to name the new object. They received over 1000 suggestions from all over the world. Some proposed Atlas as the name. Others wanted to name it Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did. Constance Lowell proposed \"Zeus,\" then \"Lowell,\" and finally Constance. These suggestions were not used.\nThe name Pluto was proposed by Venetia Burney (later Venetia Phair). She was an 11-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England then. Venetia was interested in classical mythology and astronomy. The name was of the Roman god of the underworld. She thought it was a good name for a dark and cold world. She suggested it when she was talking with her grandfather Falconer Madan. He was a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library. Madan passed the name to Professor Herbert Hall Turner. Turner told this proposed name to the astronomers in the United States.\nThe object was officially named on March 24, 1930. Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three names. The names were Minerva (which was already the name for an asteroid), Cronus, and Pluto. Pluto received all votes. The name was announced on May 1, 1930. Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia five pounds as a reward.\nThe name became popular in culture. The Disney character, \"Pluto\", was introduced in the same year. He was named in the object's honor. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto. This was to keep the tradition of naming new elements after newly discovered planets. For example, uranium had been named after Uranus, and neptunium after Neptune.\nIAU classification.\nAfter a debate, in August 2006 an IAU resolution created an official definition for the term \"planet\". According to this resolution, there are three conditions for an object in the Solar System to be considered a planet:\nPluto fails to meet the third condition. Its mass is much less than the combined mass of the other objects in its orbit: 0.07 times. Earth, by contrast, is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its orbit (excluding the moon). The IAU also decided that bodies which, like Pluto, meet criteria 1 and 2 but do not meet criterion 3, would be called dwarf planets. \nIn September 2006, the IAU included Pluto, and Eris and its moon Dysnomia, in their Minor Planet Catalogue. it gave them the official minor planet designations \"(134340) Pluto\", \"(136199) Eris\", and \"(136199) Eris I Dysnomia\".\nMoons.\nPluto and its largest moon, Charon, are sometimes called a \"binary system\". This is because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within them. The IAU has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, they classify Charon as a moon of Pluto. Pluto has four known smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, discovered in 2005, Kerberos, discovered in 2011, and Styx, discovered in 2012."}

When his opera \"Gli Equivoci nell sembiante\" was produced in Rome in 1679 the Queen of Sweden, who was living in Rome at the time, was very impressed and gave him the job of being her Maestro di cappella. In February 1684 he became Maestro di Cappella to the viceroy of Naples. He wrote many operas for him, as well as some music for important state occasions.\nIn 1702 Scarlatti left Naples and went to Florence where he composed operas for Ferdinando de' Medici and for Cardinal Ottoboni, who made him his \"maestro di cappella\". In 1703 he also got a similar job in Rome at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore.\nAfter visiting Venice and Urbino in 1707, Scarlatti went back to Naples in 1708, and stayed there until 1717. However, the audiences in Naples no longer seemed interested in his music. They liked their serious operas to include comic music. Some of his best operas were written for Rome where they were produced at the Teatro Capranica. He also wrote some church music and music for royal weddings. He died in Naples.\nScarlatti's music.\nScarlatti's music forms an important link between the early Baroque Italian vocal styles of the 17th century and the classical period of the 18th century, which led to the music of Haydn and Mozart.\nPerhaps his greatest work is \"Mitridate Eupatore\". Many of his later operas are full of music which allows the singers to show off. In his opera \"Teodora\" (1697) he was the first composer to use the orchestral \"ritornello\" (a tune which keeps coming back after sections of solo singing).\nSome of his later operas written for Rome make the orchestra sound much more modern. He uses horns in the orchestra. This was a new idea.\nAs well as operas, Scarlatti composed at least five hundred chamber-cantatas. These are works for solo voice accompanied by the orchestra. Hardly any of them were published, but they contain a lot of good music.\nHe also wrote masses including the \"St Cecilia Mass\" (1721)."}

The Italian irredentism was actively followed by many Italians in Istria (called Istrian Italians), like the Italian hero Nazario Sauro of Capodistria (actual Koper).\nIndeed, between 1918 and 1947 Istria was part of the Kingdom of Italy, but after WWII was part of Yugoslavia. Now the Istrian Italians are reduced to a small minority, who has survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII.\nFurthermore, after the war was created the \"Free Territory of Trieste\" in north-western Istria: in the years following the division of the territory between Italy and Yugoslavia, up to 40,000 Istrian Italians chose to leave the Yugoslav \"B zone\" and move to the \"A zone\" or Italy for various reasons - some were intimidated into leaving and some simply preferred not to live in Tito's Yugoslavia.\nSince the end of WWII the irredentism has totally disappeared in Istria, even because of the Istrian exodus.\nActually Istria is populated mainly by Slavs, but nearly 50,000 Italians still live there (divided between the areas of Istria belonging to Croatia, Slovenia and Italy).\nCapodistria and Muggia.\nCapodistria (actual Koper) and Muggia were the centers of the irredentism in Istria. In these cities there was the main \"Comitato istriano\" (Istrian Committee for Union to Italy), the meeting place of the most famous istrian irredentists like Carlo Combi e Antonio Madonizza. From there sailed, in 1848, many Istrian Italians to fight for Venice against the Austrians with the Legione Istriano-dalmata.\nAfter 1866 - when Venice and the Veneto region were united to Italy - in all Istria there was full support for the irredentism. The Italian hero Nazario Sauro was born in Capodistria.\nActually only Muggia remains Italian, as part of the Province of Trieste."}

It happened at about the same time as Gorbachev's \"glasnost\" reforms, which made what the government did not as much of a secret.\nThe Soviet Union was a communist country. The government controlled the economy. People did not own their own land or businesses. Under perestroika, some people could even start to own their own businesses.

Dwight Eisenhower lived at Gettysburg in his later years.\nHowever, it is also known for the Lutheran Theological Seminary, founded in 1826, Gettysburg College (originally Pennsylvania College), which began operating in 1832, and\nHarrisburg Area Community College.\nMany roads come from Gettysburg. It is at the junction of U.S. Route 15, U.S. Route 30 (the Lincoln Highway). Today it is a 2\u00bd hour drive from Philadelphia. It is also a 3\u00bd hour drive from Pittsburgh by the Pennsylvania Turnpike and U.S. Route 15. Gettysburg Regional Airport, a small general aviation airport, is west of Gettysburg. Gettysburg has weather that changes from around in the winter months to almost in the summer."}

A short time after the Battle of Gettysburg the place was bought. The Union dead were moved from shallow (not deep) burial places on the battlefield to the cemetery. It was supported by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin. The local attorney David Wills was the person who mostly bought the land, managed the building of the cemetery, and planned its ceremony. However, the basic concept and early organizing efforts were led by rival lawyer David McConaughy. The landscape architect William Saunders designed the cemetery. It was called the \"Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg\" at first.\nIt was dedicated on November 19, 1863. Edward Everett spoke at the ceremony. Abraham Lincoln followed with the shorter but much more famous Gettysburg Address.\n3,512 Union soldiers were buried in the cemetery. 979 are unknown."}

Most are protons and alpha particles, which are the nuclei of helium atoms. Some are electrons (beta particles), gamma rays or photons and a tiny fraction are even heavier particles.\nOrigin.\nTheir origin is not exactly known. There is evidence that many primary cosmic rays come from the supernovae of massive stars. However, this is not thought to be their only source. Active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays. Galactic cosmic rays are Particles trapped in the magnetic field of Earth, Particles sent flying into space during a solar flare, and High-energy protons and heavy ions that originate outside our solar system\nSecondary cosmic rays.\nCosmic rays can have as much energy as 1020 eV, far higher than the 1012 to 1013 eV that man-made particle accelerators can produce. \nWhen cosmic ray particles enter the Earth's atmosphere they hit other particles, like molecules of oxygen and nitrogen. This causes a shower of lighter particles, a so-called 'air shower'.\nThe number of particles made in an air shower event can reach billions. All of the particles in the shower stay within about one degree of the first particle's path. In a shower are x-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. \nTypical particles produced in such collisions are neutrons and charged mesons such as positive or negative pions and kaons. Some of these decay into muons. These are able to reach the surface of the Earth, and even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines. The muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors. The observation of a secondary shower of particles in different detectors at the same time shows that all of the particles came from that event.\nPractical importance.\nEffects on Earth chemistry.\nCosmic rays are responsible for the continuous production of certain unstable isotopes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon-14, by the reaction:\nCosmic rays kept the level of carbon-14 in the atmosphere roughly constant (70 tons) for at least the past 100,000 years, until the beginning of above-ground nuclear weapons testing in the early 1950s. This is an important fact used in radiocarbon dating used in archaeology.\nEffect on space vehicles.\nCosmic rays are of great practical interest, because they can damage microelectronics and life outside the protection of the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field.

However, it can also be used to show disapproval. Claudia Johnson says that \"Janeitism\" is \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm (love) for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her (about her)\".\nJaneitism did not begin until after J. E. Austen-Leigh published \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1870. When this was published, Jane Austen became much more popular. This worried the literary elite. They felt they had to separate their liking of Austen from the \"masses\". The word \"Janeite\" was first begun by the literary scholar George Saintsbury in his 1894 introduction to a new edition of \"Pride and Prejudice\". Austen scholar Deidre Lynch explains, \"he meant to equip himself with a badge of honor he could jubilantly (triumphantly, happily) pin\". In the early twentieth century, Janeitism was \"principally (mostly) a male enthusiasm shared among publishers, professors, and literati\". Rudyard Kipling even printed a short story called \"Janeites\" about a group of World War I soldiers who were fans of Austen's novels.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s,Austen's works were accepted at school, and the word began to change its meaning. It began to mean the people who liked Austen in the \"wrong\" way. The word, according to Lynch, is now \" and against \"other\" people\"."}

They are the chief protein components of chromatin, the active component of chromosomes. \nHistones act as spools around which DNA winds, and play a role in gene regulation. Without histones, the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long. For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but wound on the histones it has about 90 millimeters of chromatin, which, when duplicated and condensed during mitosis, result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes.\nFunctions.\nCompacting DNA strands.\nHistones act as spools around which DNA winds. This packs in the large genomes of eukaryotes to fit inside cell nuclei. The compacted molecule is 40,000 times shorter than an unpacked molecule.\nChromatin regulation.\nHistones undergo changes which alter their interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins. Long-term changes in histone/DNA interaction cause epigenetic effects. Combinations of modifications are thought to constitute a code, the so-called \"histone code\". Histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as gene regulation, DNA repair and chromosome condensation (mitosis).\nExamples.\nExamples of histone modifications in transcription regulation include:\nHistory.\nHistones were discovered in 1884 by Albrecht Kossel. The word \"histone\" dates from the late 19th century and is from the German \"Histon\", of uncertain origin: perhaps from Greek \"histanai\" or from \"histos\". Until the early 1990s, histones were dismissed as merely packing material for nuclear DNA. During the early 1990s, the regulatory functions of histones were discovered.\nThe discovery of the H5 histone appears to date back to 1970's.\nConservation across species.\nHistones are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, and in certain Archaea, namely Euryarchaea, but not in bacteria. Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, which suggests they are vital to the biology of the nucleus. In contrast, mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA, most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio.\nCore histones are highly conserved proteins, that is, there are very few differences among the amino acid sequences of the histone proteins of different species.

Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this purpose. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. \nFatty acids may be either saturated or unsaturated. Unsaturated compounds have reactive double bonds; saturated ones do not.\nFatty acids are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from, or contained in, an animal or vegetable fat, oil, or wax. Natural fatty acids commonly have a chain of four to 28 carbon atoms (usually unbranched and even numbered), which may be saturated or unsaturated. This would include acetic acid, although this is not usually considered a fatty acid (not a lipid). \nThe blend of fatty acids in mammalian skin, together with lactic acid and pyruvic acid, are distinctive. They allow animals with a keen sense of smell to identify individuals."}

It is usually caused by doing the same thing repeatedly or without breaks. Using a computer or mobile for long periods of time is a common cause of this problem.\nRepetitive strain injury is described as a sudden, intense pain in affected parts of the body, often the wrists, neck, back or hands, that keeps coming back. It is different from more specific diagnoses, because there are many possible causes for RSI. The pain is often spread across different muscle groups and inspection of the affected area usually cannot show any differences from that of a healthy person. Because of this, treatment for RSI is usually limited to rest and exercises, and sometimes wearing a brace."}

This is usually done to secure a lower interest rate and for the convenience of paying only one loan.\nDebt consolidation usually entails taking a secured loan against an asset, such as a house, and using this to pay off higher-interest unsecured loans and credit card debts. However this puts the individuals assets at risk if they do not keep up payment.\nSometimes, debt consolidation companies will discount the amount of the loan. When the debtor is in danger of bankruptcy, the debt consolidator will buy the loan at a discount. A prudent debtor can shop around for consolidators who will pass along some of the savings. Consolidation can affect the ability of the debtor to discharge debts in bankruptcy, so the decision to consolidate must be weighed carefully."}

During this time, a large number of impact craters formed on the Moon. By inference the same thing happened on Earth, Mercury, Venus, and Mars as well.\nThe evidence for this event comes from the dating of lunar samples, which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed at that time. Many hypotheses have been suggested to explain how asteroidal or cometary material got into the inner solar system, but no consensus yet exists. One popular theory is that the gas giant planets migrated in orbit at this time, causing objects in the asteroid belt and/or Kuiper belt to be forced into orbits which reached the terrestrial planets. \nSome think that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling."}

{"id": "242332", "revid": "642202", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242332", "title": "The Black Cat", "text": " \n\"The Black Cat\" is a short story by Edgar Allen Poe. It was first published in August 1843 in \"The Saturday Evening Post\". In the story, a murderer tries to hide his crime. In the end, his guilt makes him admit the crime. Peter Lorre starred in a Roger Corman movie based on the story.\nSummary.\nOn the eve of his death, an unnamed narrator opens the story by proclaiming that he is sane, despite the wild narrative he is about to convey. This narrative begins years before, when the narrator\u2019s honorable character is well known and celebrated. He confesses a great love for cats and dogs, both of which, he says, respect the fidelity of friendship, unlike fellow men. The narrator marries at a young age and introduces his wife to the domestic joys of owning pets. Among birds, goldfish, a dog, rabbits, and a monkey, the narrator singles out a large and beautiful black cat, named Pluto, as his favorite.\nThough he loves Pluto, the narrator begins to suffer from violent mood swings, predominantly due to the influence of alcohol. He takes to mistreating not only the other animals but also his wife. During this uncontrollable rage, he spares only Pluto. After returning home quite drunk one night, the narrator lashes out at Pluto. Believing the cat has avoided him, he vengefully grasps the cat, only to be bitten on the hand. In demonic retaliation, the narrator pulls a penknife from his pocket and cuts out one of the cat\u2019s eyes. Though the narrator wakes the next morning with a partial feeling of remorse, he is unable to reverse the newly ominous course of his black soul. Ignored for certain now by the wounded cat, the narrator soon seeks further retaliation. He is overwhelmed by a spirit of PERVERSENESS, and sets out to commit wrong for the sake of wrong. He hangs Pluto from the limb of a tree one morning.\nOn the night of Pluto\u2019s hanging, the narrator\u2019s family\u2019s house burns down, but he dismisses the possibility of a connection between the two events. The day after the fire, which destroys all the narrator\u2019s possessions, he witnesses a group of neighbors collected around a wall that remains standing. Investigating their shouts of amazement, the narrator discovers the impression of a gigantic cat\u2014with a rope around its neck\u2014on the surface of the wall. The narrator attempts to explain rationally the existence of the impression, but he finds himself haunted by this phantasm over the course of many months. One night, while out drunk, the narrator discovers a black object poised upon a large barrel of alcohol. A new black cat has appeared, resembling Pluto but with a splash of white on his fur.\nAs with Pluto, the narrator experiences a great fondness for the mysterious cat, which no one has seen before. The cat becomes part of the household, much adored by his wife as well. However, following the earlier pattern, the narrator soon cannot resist feelings of hatred for the cat. These murderous sentiments intensify when the narrator discovers that the cat\u2019s splash of white fur has mysteriously taken on the shape of the gallows, the structure on which a hanging takes place. The white fur reveals the mode of execution that claimed Pluto, and the narrator pledges revenge.\nOne day, descending into the cellar of the building with his wife, the narrator almost trips over the cat. Enraged, the narrator grabs an axe to attack the cat, but his wife defends the animal. Further angered by this interference, the narrator turns his rage at his wife and buries the axe in her head. Faced with the evidence of his crime, the narrator considers many options for the body\u2019s disposal, including dismemberment and burial. The narrator eventually decides to take advantage of the damp walls in the basement and entomb the body behind their plaster. Without any difficulty, the narrator creates a tomb in n the plaster wall, thereby hiding the body and all traces of his murder. When he finally turns to the cat, it is missing, and he concludes that it has been frightened away by his anger.\nOn the fourth day after the murder, the police arrive unexpectedly at the narrator\u2019s apartment. Cool and collected, the narrator leads them through the premises, even into the basement. Though facing the scene of the crime, the police do not demonstrate any curiosity and prepare to leave the residence. The narrator, however, keeps trying to allay their suspicion. Commenting upon the solid craftsmanship of the house, he taps on the wall\u2014behind which is his wife\u2019s body\u2014with a cane. In response to the tapping, a long, loud cry emanates from behind the wall. The police storm the wall and dismantle it, discovering the hidden corpse. Upon its head sits the missing cat.\nAnalysis.\nMuch like \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d follows the narrator\u2019s descent into madness after he proclaims his sanity in the tale\u2019s opening paragraph. Even the narrator acknowledges the \u201cwild\u201d nature of the tale, attempting thereby to separate his mental condition from the events of the plot. The nature of the narrator\u2019s madness differs from that of the narrator of \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart.\u201d \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d does not concern itself only with the self-contained nature of the narrator\u2019s mind. Rather, the narrator confesses an alcoholism that interferes with his grasp on reality and produces mood swings. Alcohol is, like the cat, an external agent that intrudes on the dynamics of the plot. The introduction of alcohol as a plot device is also significant because Edgar Allan Poe was an reputedly uncontrollable drunk throughout his lifetime. For many years, his biographers asserted that he died of alcohol poisoning in a gutter in Baltimore. More recent biographies insist that the exact cause of Poe\u2019s death cannot be determined. Regardless, it is certain that Poe suffered from the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption throughout his life.\nThe influential literary critic Tzvetan Todorov introduced a concept of the \u201cfantastic\u201d in the early 1970s to discuss literature of horror, and the idea can be applied usefully to \u201cThe Black Cat.\u201d The fantastic, he asserts, explores the indefinite boundary between the real and the supernatural. The fantastic is a literary category that contains elements of both the rational and the irrational. One of the fantastic elements in \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d is the existence of the second cat\u2014with the changing shape of its white fur and its appearance on the corpse behind the wall. These plot twists challenge reality, but they do not completely substitute a supernatural explanation for a logical one. It is possible that the plot twists derive only from the insanity of the narrator. As a result, the plot twists, like the fantastic, hover between the real and the supernatural. The resolution of the story is both rationally possible and tremendously unlikely; the cat could inhabit the basement walls, but it is difficult to believe that it would remain silently in the wall for a long time or go unnoticed by the overly meticulous narrator."}

Certain benzodiazepines can be used as drugs that increase the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA. The resulting drug has sedative effects. Depending on the drug, the effect may be stronger or weaker. The first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, and made available in 1960 by the medicine company Hoffmann\u2013La Roche.\nIn general taking benzodiazepines is safe and effective in the short term. Longer term use is controversial: In the long term, the drug may become less effective and problems of dependency may show. \nBenzodiazepines may not be safe to be taken during pregnancy. They are not teratogens, which cause birth defects, but they may cause cleft palate in a small number of babies. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are much less toxic than the drugs they replaced, the barbiturates. Death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and opiates, the potential for toxicity increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.\nBenzodiazepines uses.\nBenzodiazepines are used to treat:\nPanic Attacks: Benzodiazepines contain certain chemicals that produce a calming effect in the body. They keep the brain in a sedated state and hence help people overcome anxiety-related problems, they are also used to treat the people suffering from panic disorders.\nSeizures: Benzodiazepines are extremely powerful anticonvulsants, they are very effective in preventing epileptic seizures.\nAlcohol withdrawal: Benzodiazepines like diazepam are also used to help people fight alcohol dependence. These medicines eliminate toxins from the body and help people deal with alcohol withdrawal symptoms.\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder: Benzodiazepines are also used to treat people suffering from GAD.\nInsomnia: Benzodiazepines are an effective treatment for severe insomnia. These drugs calm down the nerves in the brain and induce sleep.\nBenzodiazepine Effects &amp; Withdrawal Symptoms.\nBenzodiazepines affect the central nervous system, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter known as GABA. This results in a person experiencing a sensation of calmness and sedation, resulting in feeling more relaxed, less anxious, and increased drowsiness. When people use benzodiazepines, even under a doctor\u2019s care, they can develop a tolerance, which means that they will require increasingly larger doses to achieve the desired effects. With escalating use and at higher doses, a person may find that they require the drug to feel and function normally. This indicates the development of dependence which, once established, may result in a person experiencing symptoms of withdrawal.\nLong-term, compulsive, or otherwise problematic use of benzodiazepines can lead to significant physical dependence and a higher risk of experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, which may include seizures and hallucinations. Supervised medical treatment is usually recommended for people who are undergoing benzodiazepine withdrawal after a period of consistent use."}

He was a Whig. He served as U.S. Representative, and U.S. Senator, the 15th Governor of Massachusetts, Minister to Great Britain, and United States Secretary of State. He also taught at Harvard University and was as president of Harvard. He was the Vice-Presidential candidate of the Constitutional Union Party in 1860. He gave a long speech at Gettysburg right before Abraham Lincoln.\nWhen Abraham Lincoln became president, the Civil War broke out. Everett had been calmer about slavery, but he was a strong Unionist. He worked hard to raise support for the Union through speaking in public. In November 1863, when the military cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was dedicated, Everett was the main speaker. His two-hour speech was before the much shorter, but now more famous Gettysburg Address by President Lincoln. Everett was moved by the short speech and wrote to Lincoln, \"I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.\""}
{"id": "242394", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242394", "title": "NBA draft", "text": "The NBA draft happens every year in June. It is where teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) choose players who have never played in the NBA before. If a team chooses a player, that player cannot sign a contract to play for any teams other than that team.\nWho can be drafted.\nPlayers must be at least 19 years old at some point during the year of the draft. If the player's 19th birthday will be the next year, they are too young. If a player is from the United States, it must be at least one year after the graduation of his high school class. Some players who are star players go to college and play college basketball for just one year (because they cannot enter the draft right out of high school), then enter the NBA draft. These players are called \"one and dones\". Other players enter the draft after two or three years in college, and other players are drafted after playing in college for all four years that they can.\nIf a player has not played in college for four years, they must enter the NBA draft by declaring themselves eligible. \nHow the draft works.\nTeams take turns choosing players. When a team chooses a player, it is called a \"pick\". For example, if a player is chosen second, people will say that he was taken with the second pick in the draft. There are two rounds in the draft. Both rounds have 30 picks, so there are 60 picks in the whole draft. Each team gets one pick per round, but sometimes, a team will pick more than once in a round or not at all. This is because teams can trade draft picks for players, for money, or for other draft picks.\nWhen teams get to pick.\nThe NBA allows teams who had worse records (which means that they won fewer games) the previous season get to pick before better teams. This lets bad teams draft good players and become better. The first fourteen teams to pick are the fourteen teams that did not make the playoffs the previous season. (There are thirty teams in the NBA, and sixteen teams qualify for the playoffs every year, so fourteen teams do not.) The teams that do make the playoffs and who get picks 15 through 30 in the first round pick in reverse order of how good their records were (so the best team gets the 30th pick, the second best team gets the 29th pick, and so on). However, the first fourteen picks are given out differently so that teams will not lose games on purpose to get higher picks. These picks are given to teams in a process called the \"draft lottery\".\nDraft lottery.\nSince 1985, all teams that have missed the playoffs have participated in a lottery system to see who gets the first pick. The lottery system has changed a few times since then, but the system that the NBA uses right now uses ping pong balls that have numbers written on them. A machine picks four balls at a time, and every possible combination of numbers is assigned to a team. Teams with worse records get more combinations of numbers, which means that they have a better chance to win. The machine picks three teams, and these teams get the first three picks in the draft. The other eleven teams will pick in order of how bad their records are, so the worst team that was not selected will pick fourth, and so on.\nSuccess from the NBA Draft.\nMany star NBA players who helped their teams a lot were selected early in the NBA Draft. For example, with the first pick in the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs chose Tim Duncan. Duncan would help the San Antonio Spurs win several NBA Championships. Other star players who were chosen with the first pick are Shaquille O'Neal (chosen by the Orlando Magic in 1992), Dwight Howard (chosen by the Magic in 2004), and LeBron James (chosen by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003). However, not all players who have been chosen with the first pick have gone on to become star players. Some players have not had as much success as the teams who drafted them expected, and have been called \"draft busts\". A few players chosen with the first pick who have been called \"draft busts\" include Joe Smith (chosen by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1995), Michael Olowokandi (chosen by the Clippers in 1998), and Kwame Brown (chosen by the Washington Wizards in 2001.) On the other hand, some very successful players have been chosen very late in the draft, and have been called \"draft steals\". One such player is Manu Gin\u00f3bili, Duncan's longtime teammate with the Spurs, who was chosen with the next-to-last pick in the 1999 draft."}

The method compares the amount of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope and its decay products, in samples. The method uses known decay rates. It is the most used method of geochronology, the main way to learn the age of rocks and other geological features, including the age of the Earth itself. \nIt is used to date many kinds of natural and man-made materials. Fossils may be dated by taking samples of rocks from above and below the fossil's original position. Radiocarbon dating is much used to date archaeological materials, including ancient artifacts.\nRadiometric dating methods are used to establish the geological time scale. Among the best-known techniques are radiocarbon dating, potassium-argon dating and uranium-lead dating.\nRadioactive decay.\nAll ordinary matter is made up of combinations of chemical elements, each with its own atomic number, indicating the number of protons in the atomic nucleus. Elements exist in different isotopes, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide. Some nuclides are naturally unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will spontaneously change into a different nuclide by radioactive decay. The decay may happen by emission of particles (usually electrons (beta decay), positrons or alpha particles) or by spontaneous nuclear fission, and electron capture.\nThe age equation.\nThe mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is:\nwhere\nThis equation uses information on the parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material solidified. This is well known for most isotopic systems. Plotting an isochron (straight-line graph) is used to solve the age equation graphically. It shows the age of the sample, and the original composition.\nPreconditions.\nThe method works best if neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product enters or leaves the material after its formation. Anything which changes the relative amounts of the two isotopes (original and daughter) must be noted, and avoided if possible. Contamination from outside, or the loss of isotopes at any time from the rock's original formation, would change the result. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of alteration.\nMeasurements should be taken on samples from different parts of the rock body. This helps to counter the effects of heating and squeezing, which a rock may experience in its long history. Different dating methods may be needed to confirm the age of a sample. For example, a study of the Amitsoq gneisses from western Greenland used five different radiometric dating methods to examine twelve samples and got agreement to within 30 million years on an age of 3,640my."}

In these materials, the decay product 40Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to build up when the rock solidifies (recrystallises). Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of 40Ar to the amount of 40K remaining.

Precision is in the 0.1-1 percent range. \nThe method relies on two separate decay chains, the uranium series from 238U to 206Pb, with a half-life of 4.47 billion years and the actinium series from 235U to 207Pb, with a half-life of 704 million years.\nThe existence of two 'parallel' uranium-lead decay routes allows several dating techniques within the overall U-Pb system. \nThe term 'U-Pb dating' normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes. However, use of a single decay scheme (usually 238U to 206Pb) leads to the U-Pb isochron dating method, analogous to the rubidium-strontium dating method. \nFinally, ages can also be determined from the U-Pb system by analysis of Pb isotope ratios alone. This is termed the lead-lead dating method. Clair Cameron Patterson, an American geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium-lead radiometric dating methods, is famous for having used it to obtain one of the earliest accurate estimates of the age of the Earth.\nMineralogy.\nUranium-lead dating is usually performed on the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4), though it can be used on other minerals. Zircon incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystalline structure, but strongly rejects lead. Therefore, we can assume that the entire lead content of the zircon is radiogenic. Where this is not the case, a correction must be applied. Uranium-lead dating techniques have also been applied to other minerals such as calcite/aragonite and other carbonate minerals. These minerals often produce lower precision ages than igneous and metamorphic minerals traditionally used for age dating, but are more common in the geologic record."}

Since the first version made in 1999, Game Maker was given many new features. One of these features is 3-D graphics.\nGame Maker has a drag-and-drop interface. This lets people make games using mostly the computer mouse. Game Maker uses icons that tell the person what actions they can do. People can make simple games by moving these icons into a given order. More detailed games can be made when Game Maker Language is used.\nGame Maker has an internet community and website. There, people who use Game Maker can put their games up for others to play. People can also get help on using Game Maker from other people.\nHistory.\nGame Maker started as an animation program called \"Animo\". Each new version of Game Maker added new features. Starting with version 7.0, Game Maker was published by the YoYo Games company. \nIn May 22, 2012, YoYo Games released GM:Studio.

Imhotep also became famous as an architect. After his death, because of his attachment with the god Ptah during his work at Ptah's temple stories were spread that said that Ptah was his father. As a god he was often pictured seated, wearing a long kilt robe and a skull cap or a shaven head. He had a papyrus scroll spread on his lap to show his scholarly nature and scribal assistance. \nStep pyramid.\nAs an architect Imhotep was most famous because he was the designer of the step pyramid. Before the step pyramid, pharaohs were buried in flat topped structures called mastabas. The term mastaba comes from the word meaning bench because they look like the benches most Egyptians placed outside their door. An average mastaba had four walls, a flat top and an underground burial chamber, reached by a vertical shaft or stairwell. There were also a couple of small rooms above the burial chambers containing various items for the afterlife. The step pyramid was actually just a number of mastabas placed one on top of the other, each one smaller than the previous one.Imhotep was the architect, physician, scribe, and grand vizier of the 3rd-Dynasty pharaoh Zoser. It was Imhotep who conceived and built the Step Pyramid at Sakkara. In the Late Period, Imhotep was worshipped as the son of Ptah and a god of medicine, as well as the patron (with Thoth) of scribes. The Greeks considered him to be Asklepios.\nMedical writer.\nImhotep\u2019s best-known writings were medical scrolls. He is thought to have written the Edwin Smith papyrus. The papyrus consists of 48 injuries of which 27 are head trauma, and six are spine trauma. Here\u2019s an example for treatment of a head injury:\n\u201cExamination: If thou examinest a man having a wound in his head, while his wound does not have two lips, penetrating to the bone of his skull, (but) not having a gash, thou shouldst palpate his wound (or, thou shouldst lay thy hand upon it); shouldst thou find his skull uninjured, not having a perforation; a split, or a smash in it. Treatment: Thou shouldst bind it with fresh meat the first day (and) treat afterwards with grease, honey (and) lint every day until he recovers wound in the head\u201d \nBecoming a god.\nAround 100 years after his death Imhotep was deified (made into a god). He became the god of medicine and healing. Small temples were built in honor of him. People with injuries would sleep near his temple hoping to be healed. As a god, Imhotep was also worshiped by scribes. Scribes would offer a couple drops of water as a sacrifice to him before starting to write. Even when the Greeks took over, he was identified with another deified man called Asclepius and the Greeks continued to honor and build temples for him. \nThis continued until the Arab invasion in North Africa in the 7th century AD."}

Events include shot accuracy, fastest skater, puck control relay, hardest shot, breakaway challenge, and an elimination shootout. Players are put into teams in the same way the All-Star Game is done, which is by conferences. After each event, the winning conference is given points.\nPuck Control Relay.\nThis event is to show who is the fastest skater while also moving the puck through pylons. Two races happen; the first one has three skaters on each team race against each other, and the second has the best single racers from each team. One point is given out to the winner of each of these two events.\nFastest skater.\nThis event is to see who can skate the fastest around the rink once. Two races are held; one for the team, and one for the faster single person.\nHardest shot.\nThis event shows who has the hardest shot. Two points are given out; one for the team that has the highest average shot, and one for the player with the hardest shot. Zdeno Chara has the record for hardest shot; he set the record in 2009 when his shot went 105.4 mph. Al Iafrate had the old record, which was 105.2 mph\nMost accurate shot.\nThis event sees who can shoot four targets best. Each target is put in a corner of the net. Two points are given out; one point is for the team that hits the targets in the least amount of shots, and one point for the player who hits the targets in the least amount of shots. A player has hit all four targets in only four tries seven times: Ray Bourque in 1992 and 1993, Mark Messier in 1996, Jeremy Roenick in 2004, Tomas Kaberle in 2008, and Dany Heatley, and Evgeni Malkin in 2009.\nBreakaway Challenge.\nThis event has players shoot on a goalie. Two points are awarded; one for the team that scores the most goals, and one point to the goalie who lets in the least amount of goals. Starting in 2008, players were given points on who could score the most creative goals. Winners were voted on by fans voting with text messages.\nElimination Shootout.\nThis event has players try to score on a breakaway against a goalie. When a player does not score, he is not allowed to compete anymore. The winner is the player who is the last one still playing."}

The fruit grows on trees that are native to India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Star fruit is common in the south of Asia, Australia and all of the islands around Australia. The tree is also grown in tropic islands. \nOrigins and distribution.\nThe carambola has been growing in parts of Asia for hundreds of years. It may have first been in Sri Lanka and Moluccas. Malaysia grows the most carambola in the world and it also grows in Bangladesh.\nBecause of insects and disease, whole carambolas cannot be taken into the USA. In the USA, star fruit is grown in Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, California, Texas, Arizona, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. \nTaste.\nStar fruit tastes best ripe (yellow with a little green). It will also be brown on the five edges and feel hard. If the star fruit is overripe it will be yellow with brown spots. You can eat all of the fruit, even the skin. It is sweet and very juicy. The taste is a little bit like a subtle mix of papaya, orange and grapefruit.\nCultivation.\nThe Carambola is a tropical fruit. In Northern India, it grows up to 4,000 feet in elevation. It prefers a total exposure to the sun but requires high humidity and a total of 70\u00a0inches or more of rainfall a year. It requires good drainage of the soil.\nCarambola trees are planted 20 feet or more from each other. They grow fast and makes fruit when they are four or five years old. The rain during Spring makes the amount of fruit lower. In perfect conditions, Carambola can make from 200 to 400 pounds of fruit a year. The fruit is picked mainly during the months of June, July, and August.\nMajor pests are fruit flies, ants, and birds. In the United States, they are also vulnerable to frosts. "}

It started in 1985 with the creation of Super Mario Bros. on the Famicom and later on the Nintendo Entertainment System (also called NES). It has been followed by many sequels released in almost every Nintendo video game console to date, except the Game Boy, the Game Boy Color, and the Game Boy Advance, where only remakes, ports, or other spin-offs games where released.\nMost of these games, except\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros. 2\",\u00a0\"\",\u00a0and the \"Super Mario Land \"series\", \"are about\u00a0Mario\u00a0and, normally, his brother\u00a0Luigi\u00a0and sometimes his best friend\u00a0Yoshi, in their adventure to search for and save\u00a0Princess Peach\u00a0from\u00a0Bowser, who wants to takeover the\u00a0Mushroom Kingdom, or another place, depending on the game. The Mario brothers' adventure is not easy, however, as they need to face Bowser's troops all over, who try to stop the brothers' attempts to save the princess.\nAll the games, and even some remakes, have been started by the\u00a0Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development\u00a0(also called Nintendo EAD) branch but not by the same area.\nIn 2010, the series celebrated the twenty-fifth of the release of\u00a0\"Super Mario Bros.\". The celebration included a series of videos showing various tricks throughout the series' games on the Wii's Nintendo Channel, as well as releasing a Wii port of\u00a0\"Super Mario All-Stars\", which included a history booklet of the\u00a0\"Super Mario\"\u00a0series and a CD containing several songs from games in the series.\nGames.\nSuper Mario Bros.\nThis game\u00a0is the first in the\u00a0\"Super Mario\"\u00a0series. It was made for the Famicom and the NES in 1985. This game set the way for the later games, and it was later re-released for many newer systems, including the\u00a0Game Boy Advance\u00a0and the\u00a0Virtual Console\u00a0for the Wii. This game marks the first appearance for many new heros, species, and villains. These characters include Bowser, Princess Peach (then called Princess Toadstool),\u00a0Toad\u00a0and the\u00a0Mushroom Retainers,\u00a0Goombas,\u00a0Koopa Troopas, and many more.\nA year after \"Super Mario Bros.\", Nintendo put out this game. It was made for the Famicom Disk System. It uses a slightly different form of \"Super Mario Bros.\"'s engine, with different levels and new features including different graphics and the enemies acting a different way. This game is called Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan; Nintendo of America originally thought this game was too hard and too much like the first to sell well in the United States. However, this game came in United States as part of \"Super Mario All-Stars\", and recently, this game was on the Virtual Console on the Wii.\nSuper Mario Bros. 2\nAfter seeing that the Lost Levels was too hard, they did not release it in North America and Europe. Instead they remade Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters. You can play as Mario, Luigi, Toad and Peach, each with their own powers and abilities. They need to free Subcon from the evil frog Wart. The game has been included in remakes, such as Super Mario All-Stars and on Virtual Console.\nSuper Mario Bros. 3\nThis is the fourth \"Super Mario\" game. It was made for the Famicom and the NES. Many new species appear, including main ones like Boo and Spike. Boom Boom, Dry Bones, and the Koopalings also first appear here. New power-ups also appear such as the Super Leaf, the Hammer Suit and the Frog Suit. It has been believed to be one of the greatest games of all time. Its hard and tricky levels made it a huge success. It has new power ups, new moves, items, and enemies. It also has special non-level parts of each world, including Toad Houses where lives are gotten and Spade Panels, as well as some secret parts, such as the White Toad House and the Treasure Ship.\nSuper Mario World\nThis game was released in 1990 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (also called SNES). It was also re-released as the second game in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series. In this game Mario and Peach go on a trip to Dinosaur Land but things go wrong when Bowser kidnaps Peach. This game was special for creating Yoshi and the species. It is the fifth game in the \"Super Mario\" series.\nSuper Mario 64\nThis game has its own special gameplay and story to the \"Super Mario\" series. It was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64. In this game, Mario uses Power Stars to bring back the kidnapped Peach. Mario jumps into paintings trying to find Peach. Unlike games before, the way to win the levels in this game is not to find the end of the level; instead, Mario needs to find Power Stars by finishing missions in each course. This is also the first 3D game in this series. Though it was not the first 3-D platforming game, it transformed the genre, with many games soon following its formula, using it as a sort of guide. It is widely celebrated as one of the greatest games of all time. A remake for this game came out in 2004 for the Nintendo DS called \"Super Mario 64 DS\". This game brought in new bosses, such as King Bob-omb and Eyerok.\nSuper Mario Sunshine\nThis game was released in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube. Its gameplay is almost like \"Super Mario 64\"; however, it has a different storyline. Mario, Princess Peach, and Toadsworth are taking a vacation to Isle Delfino, when they find that the island has been ruined and the Shine Sprites stolen by a strange enemy that looks like Mario himself. Mario is then taken into custody and has to get a job cleaning up the entire island. Instead of collecting Power Stars, the player collects Shine Sprites. This game also introduced many recurring characters and bosses in the Mario series, including Toadsworth, Bowser Jr., Petey Piranha, Gooper Blooper, Piantas, Nokis, Shadow Mario, and FLUDD. \"Super Mario Galaxy\" is the sequel to this game. This is the second 3D game in the series.\nNew Super Mario Bros.\nThis game is the eighth in the \"Super Mario\" series. It starts out when Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach during a strange accident. Luigi can be played in this game, too. Luigi could not be played since \"Super Mario World\". This is the first game since \"Super Mario World\" (1990) that features the classic 2D play-style of the \"Super Mario Bros.\" games. The game features a solo story mode with Mario or Luigi, a two-player wireless game Mario vs. Luigi, as well as a mini-game mode for up to four players. It was released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is the sequel, though that game is not thought to be a direct sequel to the DS game.\nSuper Mario Galaxy\nThis game is the ninth in the \"Super Mario\" series and the third 3D game in the series. It is different than the first two 3D games for the \"Mario\" series, this game takes place in deep space. Mario goes to the Star Festival because Princess Peach asks him, when the town comes under attack by Bowser's air forces. He steals Peach's castle and sends it to the center of the universe, making Mario have to save her. Most of the game's levels includes many small planets and asteriods, while others have bigger planets. A new popular species and character appear, Luma and Rosalina. It was released in 2007 for the Wii. This game has a direct sequel, called \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\". It is the only 3D game that has a direct sequel.\nNew Super Mario Bros. Wii\nThis game is the tenth in the \"Super Mario\" series and the second for the Wii. It is an indirect sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros.\". In this game, Yoshis are can be ridden and the Koopalings return. It has single-player and multiplayer mode for up to four players at the same time. This is the first time more than one player can play at the same time in a \"Super Mario\" game. Two new characters that can be played appear, Yellow Toad and Blue Toad. New power-ups also appear including the Propeller Suit and the Penguin Suit.\nSuper Mario Galaxy 2\nThis is the eleventh in the \"Super Mario\" series. It is also the fourth 3D game in the series. The sequel contains many things from the first game, such as the story, the adventure being in outer space, objects such as Launch Stars, recurring items including the Bee Mushroom, and things about gravity. The game shows new things such as the use of Yoshi and new power-ups such as the Cloud Flower. Rosalina reappears and new characters of the Luma species appear including Lubba. This is the third game for the Wii in the \"Super Mario\" series.\nSuper Mario 3D Land\nThis is the fifth 3D game in the series, and the twelfth game in the \"Super Mario\" series. The levels of this game are much more straight and flat than the other 3D games, almost like side-scrolling games. Many past power-ups and characters return, such as False Bowsers, the Super Leaf and Boom Boom. There are new power-ups, such as Boomerang Mario, and White Tanooki Mario. There are also new enemies and a female partner of Boom Boom named Pom Pom.\nNew Super Mario Bros. 2\nThis game is another side-scroller in the series released in 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. It's the third game in the \"New Super Mario Bros. \"series and a direct sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros.\". The game has lots of coins, and Raccoon Mario is back after not being in a game for a long time. A new power-up called the Gold Flower turns Mario into Gold Mario.\nNew Super Mario Bros. U\nThis game is a side-scroller for the Wii U. The game uses some things from \"Super Mario World\" like Baby Yoshis, Sumo Bros., Bony Beetles, and diagonal pipess. The game is very much the same as \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" with its four-player mode, what is different is a player with a Wii U GamePad can make platforms in what Nintendo calls \"Boost Mode\". It is the first \"Super Mario\" game (and \"Mario\" game) in high-definition. Flying Squirrel Mario is new.\nSuper Mario 3D World\nThis game is the console sequel to \"Super Mario 3D Land\". The game lets the player turn into Cat Mario by picking up a Super Bell. Everyone who could be played in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" can be played again, with the same exact power. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad try to save the Sprixie Princesses that Bowser has kidnapped and save the Sprixie Kingdom.\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nThis game is an open-world 3D platformer. The game introduces Cappy, a new character in the Mario series. He allows Mario to control objects and characters, in which the game calls \"capturing.\" In the game, Mario and Cappy chase Bowser across different worlds, as he has kidnapped Princess Peach. The game was released on October 27, 2017.\nRemakes and re-releases.\nSuper Mario Bros. (handheld)\nIn 1987, an easier \"Super Mario Bros.\" was released for the Game &amp; Watch. It is a sidescroller where Mario had to move over many platforms while keeping away from Lakitus and Bullet Bills.\nSuper Mario All-Stars\nThis game (called Super Mario Collection in Japan) was released in 1993 also for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a remake of the first four \"Super Mario\" series games. \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", and \"\". This game changed the four games' graphics and sound to make them better.\nSuper Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World\nThis game is an America/Europe-only remake of \"Super Mario All-Stars\" that also has \"Super Mario World\" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the second remake of the series.\nSuper Mario Bros. Deluxe\nThis game is a Game Boy Color remake which includes the first two \"Super Mario\" games ever released: \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" (Super Mario Bros.: For Super Players). It also has many other collectibles, like images that could be printed with the Game Boy Printer, a calendar, and a fortune teller. Unlike other remakes, it was not developed by Nintendo EAD, but by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2 (also called Nintendo R&amp;D2).\nSuper Mario Advance\nThis game is a remake of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" made for the Game Boy Advance, and released in 2001. Like \"Super Mario All-Stars\", this game had changed graphics.\nThis game is a remake of \"Super Mario World\" made for the Game Boy Advance. It was the second in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series and was released in 2002. There are many differences between \"Super Mario World\" and this game. The game was a gigantic hit for Nintendo and the Game Boy Advance, selling 3,290,000 copies in the United States and 5,460,000 copies worldwide. Luigi's sprite (video game graphic) has been changed and made taller than Mario, like how he looks now, and \"Mario Bros.\" has been put in the game.\nn 2003, the fourth in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series, was released for the Game Boy Advance. It is much the same graphics and sound to the \"Super Mario All-Stars\" form, and made use of the e-Reader. A few e-cards came with new copies of the game, while two sets (called \"series\") of cards, were released and sold with the game. By scanning special cards into the e-Reader, players were able to send items, videos, and most importantly, new levels into the game. One important item was the Cape Feather from \"Super Mario World\", which let Mario change into Cape Mario. There were also two Switch cards that the player could turn on (and turn off) the effects of by scanning them; the Orange Switch and the Blue Green Switch. Scanning these switches set off small uses in the game. The e-Reader item is still available in the European form, but has been turned off and cannot be used anymore.\nThe NES form of \"Super Mario Bros.\" was released for the Game Boy Advance as part of the \"Classic NES\" series of games in celebrating and remembering for the 20th anniversary of the release of the first Famicom and NES. It does not have any new additions, all of the errors were left in the game, and the graphics were shrank to fit the GBA screen size.\nIn Japan, the \"Classic NES\" series was called Famicom Mini. Super Mario Bros. 2 (\"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\") was released only in Japan. Much like \"Super Mario Bros.\", it did not have any new items, the errors were the same, and the graphics shrank.\nSuper Mario 64 DS\nThis game is a remake of \"Super Mario 64\". It was released in 2004 for the Nintendo DS. It is also the first \"Mario\" game released for the Nintendo DS. Though it is a remake, there are many differences between it and the first. One difference is that there are many secret stars, making 150 Power Stars instead of 120. Wario, Luigi, and Yoshi can be played, and mini-games were added.\nSuper Mario All-Stars Limited Edition\nReleased for the Wii in 2010, this game celebrates the 25th anniversary of Mario by having the same games as \"Super Mario All-Stars\".\nNew Super Luigi U\nThis is a game released to praise the Year of Luigi. It keeps many of the same things from \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", such as the story and world map. It has also been released as a DLC title for \"New Super Mario Bros. U\". However all of the levels have been changed, and Mario is gone, making Luigi the main character. Nabbit can be played, taking the place of Mario. The boxed form was for sale until the end of the Year of Luigi (2013).\nNew Super Mario Bros. U + New Super Luigi U\nA collection of both \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" and \"New Super Luigi U\" on the same disc, released with the Mario &amp; Luigi Deluxe Wii U set (known as the Premium Pack in Europe) only. This game has changes to the originals, including a new title screen and over 200 videos included as a present.\nNew Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe\nA collection of both \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" and \"New Super Luigi U\" on the same game card, released with some new additions to \"New Super Mario Bros. U +\" \"New Super Luigi U.\" It was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.\n\"Super Mario Land\" series.\nSuper Mario Land\nIt plays much the same to the games on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the first game to have Princess Daisy instead of Princess Peach. The goal of the player is to beat Tatanga and save Princess Daisy. Mario can beat enemies by jumping on their head, but some cannot be beaten this way. It released on Virtual Console in 2011 on 3DS.\nThis is the second in the \"Super Mario Land\" series, released in 1992, three years after \"Super Mario Land\". This is the first game to have Wario, the main rival of Mario. In this game, it is made known that what happened in \"Super Mario Land\" was made by Wario so that he could take over the castle Mario owned. He uses the power of six magic coins to lock the castle, leaving them to the care of eight of his assistants (including Tatanga) so that Mario cannot get inside. Now, Mario needs to travel through six different worlds to get those coins and his castle back from the money-grabbing anti-hero. This game has better graphics, as well as a save feature, which is not present in \"Super Mario Land\" because of its short length. However, it keeps the same Mario-style gameplay and even brings back the Fire Flower power-up. There is also a new power-up, which is a carrot that lets Mario slide across certain areas. Like \"Super Mario World\", Mario now has the spin jump ability, which can be used to kill certain enemies quickly.\nTaking place after his loss in \"Super Mario Land 2\", Wario makes a decision to go on a hunt to get himself enough money to get a castle of his own. During his hunt, he discovers many treasures as he fights Captain Syrup and her army, the Black Sugar Pirates. The gameplay in Wario Land differs slightly from the previous Super Mario Land installments. For example, if the player holds down the B button, then Wario does not run. His momentum does increase, however, if Wario is using the Jet Wario power-up, which lets him fly through the air for a short amount of time at super speed. His other power-ups are Bull Wario, which gives him super strength and the power to stick to ceilings and conveyor belts, and the Dragon Wario power-up, which lets him blow fire. Wario is also able to hold and cast enemies (as well as coins, which are normally needed to go out of a stage).\nVB Mario Land\nThis was a \"Super Mario Land\" game planned for the Virtual Boy which ended up called off because of the short time the system was out. The game was going to use all of the powers of the system and would have dungeons much the same to \"The Legend of Zelda\" games. Not much is known about this game, but it is known Wario was set to show up, as would a three-dimensional (also called 3-D) Mario Bros.. It is thought that some ideas were taken from this game and put into \"Mario Clash\"."}

It is the only historically black college in the state. It is the westernmost historically black college in the United States. Though in a rural setting just 10\u00a0miles east of Guthrie, Langston also serves an urban mission with University Centers in both Tulsa and Oklahoma City.\nHistory.\nThe school was started in 1897. Tbe school was first known as the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University. Langston University was created because of the second Morrill Act in 1890. The law made states with land grant colleges (such as Oklahoma State University, then Oklahoma A&amp;M) to either allow African-Americans in as students, or provide an alternative school for them to attend. This was required in order to receive federal money. Langston University is named for John Mercer Langston (1829-1897). He was a civil rights pioneer. He was the first African American member of Congress from Virginia. Langston started the Howard University Law School. He also served as American consul-general to Haiti.\nPoet Melvin B. Tolson taught at Langston from 1947 until 1964. Tolson was portrayed by Denzel Washington in the film \"The Great Debaters\".\nAcademics.\nThe University offers associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in a variety of disciplines. It is known as a leader in the field of agricultural research. It hosts the internationally known E (Kika) de la Garza Institute for Goat Research. The School currently has an open doors admissions policy.\nThe university was accredited with a Doctorate of Physical Therapy program in 2005.\nStudent activities.\nThe student life at Langston University got the attention of BET and the second season of the reality television show College Hill was filmed there. The Langston University Quiz Bowl team won games against Spelman and an all-star team from the City Colleges of Chicago on the 2009 nationally televised \"Black College Quiz\" show airing nationally throughout Black History Month in 2009 to make the championship game."}

He was a member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He is known for his ability to dribble the ball and keep it away from defenders. According to the movie \"Harlem Globetrotters: Six Decades of Magic\", Haynes could dribble the ball as many as six times a second.\nEarly playing days.\nHaynes learned to dribble the basketball from his sisters. His skills may have been helped by handling the ball on the dirt courts of his hometown. A native of Sand Springs, Oklahoma, he played basketball for Langston University from 1942-1946. While at Langston, he once dribbled out the clock in a conference tournament game to taunt an opponent, Southern University. Southern had just run up the score against a weaker team (Sam Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University). The Sam Huston team was coached by a young Jackie Robinson. Haynes' own coach, the famous Zip Gayles, punished him for the taunting, but it helped draw the attention of the Globetrotters. They were always on the search for trick ballhandlers. Langston was invited to play an exhibition game against the Globetrotters in Oklahoma City. In that game, Haynes led Langston to a 4-point win. He was immediately invited to join the Globetrotters. He returned to Langston to complete his degree. Then he began his long professional career.\nPlaying with the Harlem Globetrotters.\nHaynes played with the Globetrotters from 1947-1953. Upon leaving in 1953, he turned down a $35,000 a year offer from the Philadelphia Warriors that would have made him the second-highest paid player in the NBA. Instead, he started his own barnstorming team, the Harlem Magicians. Boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson sometimes played games with this team. Haynes later rejoined the Globetrotters as a player/coach. He also played for the Harlem Wizards.\nRetirement.\nHe retired in 1992 after a 46-year professional career, and was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame on October 2 1998. He lived in Dallas, Texas. Haynes died on May 22, 2015, in Plano, Texas, aged 89.\nLegacy.\nMany consider him the top ballhandler who ever lived. His game influenced players such as Bob Cousy, Pete Maravich, and Fred \"Curly\" Neal. It is possible that Haynes has played more professional basketball games than anyone in history, staying active well into his sixties."}

It is made up of historically black universities in the Southern United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division I for all sports. In football, it participates in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). \nThe SWAC is one of two conferences (the other being the Ivy League) which do not take part in postseason play in the FCS football tournament. It is the only one of the two whose members offer a full range of scholarships for football. The SWAC instead splits its schools into two divisions, and plays a conference championship game. Furthermore, one SWAC game, the Bayou Classic between Southern and Grambling State, is positioned on the schedule after the NCAA tournament has begun. In addition, Alabama State plays Division II rival Tuskegee annually on Thanksgiving Day (The Turkey Day Classic). \nHistory.\nIn 1920, athletic officials from six Texas HBCUs \u2013 C.H. Fuller of Bishop College, Red Randolph and C.H. Patterson of Paul Quinn College, E.G. Evans, H.J. Evans and H.J. Starns of Prairie View A&amp;M, D.C. Fuller of Texas College and G. Whitte Jordan of Wiley College \u2013 met in Houston, Texas, to discuss common interests. At this meeting, they agreed to form a new league, the SWAC.\nPaul Quinn became the first of the original members to leave the league when it did so in 1929. When Langston University of Oklahoma was allowed into the conference two years later, it began the migration of state-supported institutions into the SWAC. Southern University entered the league in 1934. Arkansas AM&amp;N entered in 1936 and Texas Southern University in 1954. \nAs the state-supported schools became bigger, it became difficult for the church-supported schools to pay for their sports teams. Soon the church-supported schools started to leave the conference. Bishop withdrew from the conference in 1956, Langston in 1957 and Huston-Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston) in 1959. That happened one year after two more state-supported schools entered the league (Grambling College and Jackson State College). The enter-exit cycle continued in 1961 when Texas College withdrew, followed by the entrance of Alcorn A&amp;M in 1962. Wiley left in 1968, the same year Mississippi Valley State College entered. Arkansas AM&amp;N exited in 1970 and Alabama State University entered in 1982. Arkansas-Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&amp;N) rejoined the SWAC on July 1, 1997, regaining full-member status one year later. Alabama A&amp;M University became the conference\u2019s tenth member when it became a full member in September, 1999 after a one year period as an affiliate SWAC member.\nCurrent championship competition offered by the SWAC includes competition for men in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track, outdoor track &amp; field and tennis. Women\u2019s competition is offered in the sports of basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track &amp; field, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.\nMembership.\nThere are currently 10 members in the SWAC.\nSWAC Championships.\nFootball.\nAll games at were played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama."}

Since 1931, it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The winner receives the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award. The award is named in honor of the first MLB commissioner. Landis served from 1920 to 1944. MVP voting takes place before the postseason. The results are not announced until after the World Series. The BBWAA began asking three writers in each league city in 1938. They made that number two per league city in 1961.\nFirst basemen, with 34\u00a0winners, have won the most MVPs among infielders. This is followed by second basemen\u00a0(16), third basemen\u00a0(15), and shortstops\u00a0(15). Of the twenty-four\u00a0pitchers who have won the award, fifteen are right-handed while nine are left-handed. Walter Johnson, Carl Hubbell, and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers to win more than once. Newhouser won his in back-to-back seasons, 1944 and 1945. Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount have won at different positions. Rodriguez is the only player to win the award with two different teams at two different positions. Barry Bonds has won the most often\u00a0(seven times). He has also won it the most times in a row (2001\u20132004). Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win more than once. Nine players have won three times and 19 have won twice.\nThe award's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979 when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received the same amount of points. There have been 17 unanimous winners, meaning they received all the first-place votes. The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22. The St. Louis Cardinals have the second most with 17\u00a0winners. Five teams have not had a winner. The most recent winners are Mike Trout in the American League and Clayton Kershaw in the National League.\nChalmers Award (1911\u20131914).\nBefore the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball at the end of the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway. Chalmers ended up giving cars to both players.\nThe following season, Chalmers created the Chalmers Award. A committee of baseball writers were to come together after the season to determine the \"most important and useful player to the club and to the league\". Since the award was not as useful at advertising as Chalmers had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.\nLeague Awards (1922\u20131929).\nIn 1922 the American League created a new award to honor \"the baseball player who is of the greatest all-around service to his club\". Winners, voted on by a committee of eight baseball writers chaired by James Crusinberry, received a bronze medal and a cash prize. Voters were required to select one player from each team. Player-managers and prior award winners were could not win. These problems resulted in the award's being dropped after 1928. The National League award, without these restrictions, lasted from 1924 to 1929.\nBaseball Writers Association of America's Most Valuable Player (1931\u2013present).\nThe BBWAA first awarded the modern MVP after the 1931 season, took the format the National League used to distribute its league award. One writer in each city with a team filled out a ten-place ballot. Ten points were given for the recipient of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, the BBWAA raised the amount of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then happened in 1961, when the number of voters was lowered to two per league city."}

The custom of gold-silver-bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 games. It has been copied for many other sports events. Creating the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928-1968 the design was always the same. One side showed a design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city. The other side showed another design of an Olympic champion. From 1972-2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the one with a custom design by the host city on the other.

For functions that act on the real numbers, it is the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. The derivative is often written as formula_1 (\"dy over dx\", meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x). The \"d\" is not a variable, and therefore cannot be cancelled out. Another common notation is formula_2\u2014the derivative of function formula_3 at point formula_4, usually read as \"formula_3 prime of formula_4\".\nDefinition of a derivative.\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is defined as the change in y over the change in x, as the distance between formula_7 and formula_8 becomes infinitely small (infinitesimal). In mathematical terms,\nThat is, as the distance between the two x points (h) becomes closer to zero, the slope of the line between them comes closer to resembling a tangent line.\nDerivatives of functions.\nLinear functions.\nDerivatives of linear functions (functions of the form formula_10 with no quadratic or higher terms) are constant. That is, the derivative in one spot on the graph will remain the same on another.\nWhen the dependent variable formula_11 directly takes formula_4's value (formula_13), the slope of the line is 1 in all places, so formula_14 regardless of where the position is.\nWhen formula_11 modifies formula_4's number by adding or subtracting a constant value, the slope is still 1, because the change in formula_4 and formula_11 do not change if the graph is shifted up or down. That is, the slope is still 1 throughout the entire graph and its derivative is also 1.\nPower functions.\nPower functions (in the form of formula_19) behave differently from linear functions, because their exponent and slope vary.\nPower functions, in general, follow the rule that formula_20. That is, if we give \"a\" the number 6, then formula_21\nAnother example, which is less obvious, is the function formula_22. This is essentially the same, because 1/x can be simplified to use exponents:\nIn addition, roots can be changed to use fractional exponents, where their derivative can be found:\nExponential functions.\nAn exponential function is of the form formula_28, where formula_29 and formula_30 are constants and formula_31 is a function of formula_4. The difference between an exponential and a polynomial is that in a polynomial formula_4 is raised to some power, whereas in an exponential formula_34 is in the power.\nExample 1.\nformula_35\nExample 2.\nFind formula_36.\nformula_37\nformula_38\nformula_39\nformula_40\nTherefore,\nformula_41\nLogarithmic functions.\nThe derivative of logarithms is the reciprocal:\nTake, for example, formula_43. This can be reduced to (by the properties of logarithms):\nThe logarithm of 5 is a constant, so its derivative is 0. The derivative of formula_45 is formula_46. So,\nFor derivatives of logarithms not in base \"e\", such as formula_48, this can be reduced to:\nTrigonometric functions.\nThe cosine function is the derivative of the sine function, while the derivative of cosine is negative sine (provided that x is measured in radians):\nProperties of derivatives.\nDerivatives can be broken up into smaller parts where they are manageable (as they have only one of the above function characteristics). For example, formula_53 can be broken up as:\nUses of derivatives.\nA function's derivative can be used to search for the maxima and minima of the function, by searching for places where its slope is zero.\nDerivatives are used in Newton's method, which helps one find the zeros (roots) of a function..One can also use derivatives to determine the concavity of a function, and whether the function is increasing or decreasing."}
{"id": "242761", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242761", "title": "Ruminant", "text": "A ruminant is an ungulate that eats and digests plant-based food such as grass. Ruminating mammals include cattle, goats, sheep, giraffes, bison, yaks, water buffalo, deer, camels, alpacas, llamas, wildebeest, antelope, pronghorn, and nilgai. All of them are Artiodactyla, cloven-hoofed animals. The word \"ruminant\" comes from the Latin word \"ruminare\" which means \"to chew over again\".\nHow rumination works.\nRumination works by chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with, and then regurgitating the semi-digested cud to re-chew it and to get the most food value out of it.\nRumination makes the half-digested food particles smaller, before they can go through the process of digestion.\nDetails.\nThe primary difference between a ruminant and non-ruminants (such as people, horses, and pigs) is that ruminants have a four-compartment stomach. \nThe four parts of the stomach are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud or bolus. \nThe cud is then regurgitated (brought up to the mouth) and chewed slowly. Fiber, especially cellulose, is broken down by microbial gut flora (bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and fungi).\nEven though the rumen and reticulum have different names, they are the same functional space, as the digesta (food material) can move back and forth between them. \nThe digesta then passes into the next chamber, the omasum, where water and many of the mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream. \nAfter this the digesta is moved to the true stomach, the abomasum. Digestion takes place here. \nThe digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. Water is absorbed in the large intestine, leaving the waste.\nAlmost all the glucose produced by breaking down cellulose is used by microbes in the rumen, and so ruminants get little glucose from the small intestine. Instead, glucose for a ruminants' brain function and lactation, if needed, is made by the liver.\nWhere ruminants are found.\nThere are 3.5 billion domestic ruminants, with about 95% being cattle, goats and sheep.\nThere are also about 75 million wild ruminants. They can be found anywhere except for the continents Australia and Antarctica. Most of them are in Europe, Africa and Asia."}

The original of these texts were written in different languages. Today, the collection of texts that is called \"The Bible\" is written in one language only. For this reason, at least some texts need to be translated. Versions of the Bible are also different in the texts they include, some texts are not part of some Bible versions. One of the first such translations is the Septuagint, which is Ancient Greek. Another well-known translation is the Vulgate, which is Latin. From about the 14th century, the Bible was also translated into other languages.\nTypes of translation.\nTranslating a text is also always linked to looking at its meaning, and to interpreting it. A word in one language cannot be translated into a word in a different language, with exactly the same meaning. \nFormal equivalence.\nOne such method of translation is called \"literal translation\" or \"formal equivalence\". Literal translation tries to be as close as possible to what is written in the original language. Often this means translating each word separately. There are a number of problems with literal translations: First, words must be added, to get a valid grammar in the target language. These words are not in the source text. The second problem is that the reader must be familiar with the subject, to understand some of the translation.\nDynamic equivalence.\nAnother way is to look at the thoughts and ideas of the source text and to get these into the target language. This is called \"dynamic equivalence\". A translation that uses dynamic equivalence may use other words and phrases, but tries to keep the meaning intact.\nParaphrasing.\nA third way is called \"paraphrasing\". It tries to explain the concepts that are found in the text, and does not even use dynamic equivalence. That way, paraphrasing may leave out sections of text, or add other sections that explain these concepts. A paraphrased text may be very easy to understand, but is not suited for in-depth study.\nUnknown words.\nAnother problem that can occur with translation is that the meaning of some words may not be known. This is often the case with words that only occur once in a text. Such words are known as Hapax legomena. Their meaning must be guessed from the context.\nSelecting the source.\nBefore the invention of the printing press, texts had to be copied by hand. This introduced errors. After a certain time there were different versions of the same text. Comparing such versions is known as textual criticism. The translation of two different versions of the same text may result in two different texts.\nTranslating names.\nSome translators also translate the names, others simply write the name as it occurs in the original."}

For many years he was professor at the University of California, San Diego. In 1957 he published a famous paper, together with three other physicists, about the origin of elements. Many scientists disagreed with ideas that he had later in his life, because he did not believe in the Big Bang theory.\nEducation and early career.\nHe started to study history at the University of Bristol, but soon changed to physics because he could then get financial help from the government (World War II was on, so science was very important to the government). He went to London and got a doctorate from University College London in 1951. He met the astronomer Margaret Peachey. He became very interested in astronomy and he married her in 1948. From then on they always worked together in several places. They worked at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Cambridge University. Then Margaret got work at the California Institute of Technology, while Geoffrey worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory. They both got jobs at the University of California, San Diego, in 1962.\nThe B2FH paper.\nIn 1957 he and his wife, together with William Fowler, the American physicist, and Fred Hoyle, the British astronomer, wrote a 104-page paper about stellar nucleosynthesis. The paper became known as the B2FH (because of their initials). It talked about nuclear reactions inside stars, showing how these reactions tear apart blocks of matter and put it together again differently. It was a similar idea to what Charles Darwin had written about 100 years earlier in the \u201cOrigin of Species\u201d, where he had described how creatures had evolved. Scientists saw this paper as the most important paper ever written about astrophysics.\nLater career.\nLater in his career Burbidge refused to accept the Big Bang theory which describes the start of the universe. Quasars are very bright objects with a very high redshift. The Big Bang theorists say that they come from places extremely far away in the universe. But Burbidge thought that quasars come from nearby galaxies, travelling near the speed of light, which explains their redshift. He thought they produced new matter as old matter was destroyed by reactions.\nAlthough many scientists disagree with Burbidge\u2019s later ideas, he is still thought of as an extremely important scientist. He was given many honours. In 2005 he and his wife were awarded the British Royal Astronomical Society Gold Medal."}

It is typically used to treat of cancer. It may use a radioactive material or particle accelerator or other source of ionizing radiation that can kill or damage cancerous cells.\nRadiation therapy may help cure several different types of cancer if they are limited to one area of the body. Doctors also use it to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy works together with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in cancers known to be affected by radiation.\nRadiation therapy is used on tumors because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of exposed tissue thus killing it. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through in order to treat the tumor), doctors aim weaker radiation beams from several angles of exposure. The beams intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. \nBesides the tumor itself, the target for the radiation may also include the lymph nodes that drain the area. Doctors include the lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of that individual cancer cells will spread. It is impossible to aim the radiation beam exactly because the tumor moves as the patient breathes. So, doctors also expect to include some healthy tissue around the tumor to make sure that the entire tumor is hit by radiation.\nRadiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation. This is different than radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis). Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure (\"curative\"). It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, Immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. \nMost common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way. The precise treatment intent will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure of healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs.\nRadiation therapy can also be used in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. Doctors limit the use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions because they worry about the radiation could start new cancers. "}

In subsistence agriculture, the amounts of food waste are unknown. Very likely, very little food is wasted, because food is produced because of a need for food. In the developed world, the food industry produces food for a global marketplace demand.\nResearch has been done to see where food waste occurred. The researchers looked at the food industry of the United States and found that food was wasted at the beginning of the food production. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and bad weather, which cause losses before harvest. Natural forces such as temperature and rainfall are the main influences on the growth of crops. For this reason, all forms of outdoor agriculture is subject to losses beecause of these influences. The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop. Food is also wasted because it does not meet certain standards or regulations for quality and appearance As a result, certain crops that do not meet these standards are not harvested; left in the field, they can provide fertilizer, or food for animals.\nFood processing.\nIt is unknown how much food waste occurs during food processing. When food is stored, considerable amounts are wasted because of pests and microorganisms. This problem occurs in countries where it is both relatively hot, and humid. These conditions boost the growth of pests and microorganisms. Extreme temperature, humidity, or microoganisms also influence the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops and account for food waste. The \"qualitative losses\" are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones. More losses occur because the food is not handled correctly, or because it loses weight or volume.\nIt is difficult to reduce some of the food waste produced by processing without affecting the quality of the product. Certain regulations concerning the safety of foods cause food to be wasted, before it even reaches the market.\nSafety regulations are in place to protect the health of the consumer. They are very important, especially where foodstuffs of animal origin are processed. Contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards.\nPreventing health issues is more important than preventing food waste, or the reuse of foods that do not meet the standards.,"}

It was made after Robert Schifreen and Stephen Gold hacked into British Telecom's Prestel viewdata service in 1984-1985. They were even able to see personal messages of Prince Philip, but they could not be prosecuted as there were no laws against hacking. This was a problem, as people could hack into systems and see personal data without breaking the law, which was why the Computer Misuse Act was made.\nSome people did not like the act, saying it was made too quickly and not given much thought. The act did not make a difference between people who hacked for fun from people who hacked to steal data or money. Other countries have made their acts for hacking using parts of the Computer Misuse Act, such as Canada and the Republic of Ireland. It has been amended many times since 1990 to keep it up to date."}

They are the simplest in structure of all metazoa.\nThe Placozoa is usually considered to have only one species, Trichoplax adhaerens, but there is enough genetic diversity that it is possible that there are multiple, morphologically similar species.\nAlthough they were first discovered in 1883, a common name does not exist for the taxon. The scientific name literally means \"flat animals\".\n\"Trichoplax\" is a small, flattened, animal around a millimetre across. Like an Amoeba, it has no regular outline, although the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of cells. The epithelial cells bear flagella, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor. Between these layers is the fiber syncytium, a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibers.\n\"Trichoplax\" feed by absorbing food particles\u2014mainly microbes\u2014with their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though \"Trichoplax\" has a small genome in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 protein-coding genes are similar to known genes in other animals.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s renewed interest among researchers led to the discovery that the animals people had been studying are adults, not larvae. This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature (as opposed to aquariums)."}

The body consists of a narrow front section, called the \"introvert\" and a larger trunk section. The introvert is retractable into the trunk.\nSipunculans have a coelom (body cavity), and a body wall somewhat similar to that of annelids. The body wall is strong and muscular. When threatened, Sipunculids can retract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel \u2013 a practice that has given rise to the name \"peanut worm\".\nIntrovert.\nThe most recognizable part of Sipunculan worms is their mouth, which is surrounded by a mass of 18\u201324 ciliated tentacles, all of which may be inverted into the body. The tentacles are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate, and are probably also function as gills. The mouth and tentacles lie at the tip of the introvert, which is otherwise decorated with numerous spines or nodules. In contrast, the trunk tends to be relatively smooth."}

Tables may include notes, headers, footers or other features. Like other graphic forms such as diagrams and illustrations, tables are often used together with prose. In books and articles, tables are often given numbers and captions. \nTables were the first way to print social and scientific data, before any other kind of graphics like graphs and charts. All the information about a modern society was recorded and published first as tables. Marriage certificates were written tables. Census results were recorded as tables, and later analysed in printed tables. All weather observations were published as printed numerical tables. Many kinds of reports to Parliament contained tables of data. Many of these methods were invented in Britain, because the government collected statistics about the population, and then published the results.\nThe use of tables is widespread in all types of communication, research and data analysis. Tables appear in print media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs and many other places. The details vary according to circumstances. Tables are extremely flexible, and can easily be constructed on computer and in print.\nTables are not always easy to understand, and there is a whole industry which takes table information and turns it into other forms, such as graphs and charts, for the benefit of the reader."}

Every region in Japan has its own tradition about cooking. Foods eaten in Japan also reflect the history of the cultural exchange between Japan and other culture. Since the modern times, the influence of the West inspired Japanese culinary tradition to invent new dishes, some of which have become popular not only inside Japan but also outside. However, most of the culinary traditions of Japan commonly think that seasonality is important. \nExamples.\nSoya beans.\nSoya beans are a very important ingredient in Japanese cooking; it is used in soya sauce, natto, miso and tofu. Soya milk is also used as a drink. One example of a dish with soya beans in it, is tofu. Tofu is made from pressing soybeans into cubes and then boiling them. Tofu is often in soups and stews. Deep fried tofu is also used in many popular Japanese dishes, for example as kitsune udon and inari sushi.\nNoodles.\nNoodles (like in most Asian foods) are used often in Japanese foods. The dishes usually come originally from China; nevertheless they have reached a unique development in Japan.\nSeafood.\nJapan is surrounded by the ocean so there is a rich variety of seafood which is an important part of Japanese cooking.\nMeat.\nJapanese people did not eat meat until the Europeans first came. Fish was the most common food. \nWasabi.\nWasabi is Japanese horseradish. It is often a green paste used with sashimi and sushi. Wasabi is also used with many other Japanese foods. \nWasabi is sold as a paste or in powder form. Wasabi powder has to be mixed with water to be turned into a paste. Wasabi has a strong, very spicy (hot) taste.\nSashimi.\nSashimi is very thinly cut raw seafood. Many different kinds of fresh fish and other seafood are served raw in Japanese dishes. Sashimi is one of them. It is almost the same as sushi, but it has no vinegar rice. When the slices of fish are put on small pieces of rice they are called \"Nigiri Sushi\".\nSashimi is artistically arranged and put on the plate on top of shredded daikon and shiso leaves. The fish pieces are dipped into soya sauce before being eaten.\nSeaweed.\nSeaweed has been a very important part of Japanese dishes for a long time. Today, many different types of seaweed are used in soups, seasonings and other forms of Japanese cooking. These are the three seaweeds used the most:\nTofu.\nTofu is a popular traditional dish in Japanese and has become popular in Asia and the rest of the world."}
{"id": "243422", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243422", "title": "Pointe du Hoc", "text": "Pointe du Hoc is a place in the Normandy in northern France. It has steep cliffs about 100 m high that drop down toward the sea and a very thin beach at the bottom that is underwater at high tide and dry at low tide. It was important during World War II.\nIn 1944, Pointe du Hoc was part of Operation Overlord, which was the biggest sea invasion in history. During World War II, the Allied military commanders planned how to attack France, which had been captured by the German Wehrmacht. The Germans had put very large guns at Pointe du Hoc. There were six 155mm cannons in concrete forts that could shoot at Allied ships and troops that wanted to come on land at Utah Beach and Omaha Beach. \nAllied planes, flying from England, dropped bombs on Pointe du Hoc. But they did not break the heavy artillery guns, and the Germans moved them away. \nFor about five months, the U.S. Rangers trained with British commandos to prepare for their attack on France. They practiced climbing British cliffs. \nOnce the Allied commanders decided to attack France, they used flat-bottomed landing craft made to carry troops onto beaches. These special landing boats were called LCA and LCVP's or Higgins boats. British navy sailors sailed them. The boats were lowered into the sea a few kilometers away from the cliffs. The British had added some extra armour to the sides of the boats to protect them. This made it harder for the boats to move fast and turn.\nAttack.\nThe American 2nd and 5th Army Ranger Divisions attached the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc. Colonel James Earl Rudder led the attack. The attack started at 6:30 a.m of D-Day, when the battleship USS Texas stopped shooting at Pointe du Hoc. Because the weather was bad, the Rangers' boats drifted in the water and it took an extra half hour for them to get to the beach. By then, the Germans had come out of their forts and were ready at the top of the cliff.\nThe American landing boats reached the beach, and the Army Rangers ran up the beach to the cliffs. The soldiers used ropes attached to rocket-powered grappling hooks to climb the cliffs. Two soldiers carried the ropes and grappling hooks in a wooden box. The soldiers also used ladders that were attached to landing boats and grappling hooks that were shot up from the boats.\nWhen the Rangers reached the top of the cliffs, small groups of soldiers attacked the Germans. After reaching the forts, where they thought the Germans kept their guns, the Rangers found that the guns were no longer there. The Rangers went inland and searched for the guns and found them. They used thermite fire grenades to melt important parts of the guns. \nOut of 225 soldiers only 90 were still able to fight when reinforcements came."}

{"id": "243487", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243487", "title": "John Smith (explorer)", "text": "John Smith (c. January 1580 \u2013 21 June 1631) was a English soldier, explorer, and author. Smith was a leader of the first settlements at the Virginia Colony in 1608-1609. He explored the rivers of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay and drew a map of the Chesapeake Bay area and New England.\nSmith's books and maps were very important in supporting Englishmen living in the New World. He wrote, \"Here every man may be master and owner of his own labour and land and if he has nothing but his hands, he may still grow rich.\"\nAt Jamestown Smith trained the people to farm and work so they would have food to eat. He told them \"he who shall not work, shall not eat.\" Smith's strength of character and his determination overcame many problems including the harsh weather, lack of water, living in a wilderness, with people who did not want to work, and attacks from the Powhatan Indian tribes.\nEarly adventures.\nSmith was born in January 1580 at Willoughby, Lincolnshire where his parents rented a farm. He claimed descent from the ancient Smith family of Cuerdley.\nSmith left home at the age of 16 and went to sea. He served as a soldier in the army of Henry IV of France against the Spaniards, fought for Dutch revolt from the Spanish King Philip II of Spain. He went to the Mediterranean Sea where he worked in both trade and piracy. He then fought against the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman wars and for the Austrian Habsburgs in Kingdom of Hungary in 1600 and 1601.\nSmith is reputed to have defeated, killed and beheaded Turkish commanders in 3 duels. He was knighted by the Transylvanian Prince and was given a horse and coat of arms showing 3 Turks' heads. In 1602 he was wounded in a skirmish, captured and sold as a slave. Smith wrote that his Turkish master sent him as a gift to his Greek mistress in Constantinople, who fell in love with Smith. He then escaped from the Ottoman lands and returned to England in 1604.\nIn Jamestown.\nIn 1606 the Smith was hired by the Virginia Company to settle in Virginia Colony for profit. They set sail in three ships, in December 1606. Smith had a servant named Samuel Collier. Samuel Collier would stay by him most of the way through. \nThere were problems on the voyage and Smith was charged with mutiny. Captain Newport planned to execute him. The Captain opened a letter of orders from the Virginia Company which stated that Smith was to be one of the leaders of the new colony, so Smith was not killed.\nThe English arrived in April 1607 and Captain Wingfield chose Jamestown to be the location for the colony. In summer the settlers were still living in temporary housing. After the four-month ocean trip, food supplies were only enough for each person to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day. Due to the weather and lack of food disease spread through the people and by September, more than half died.\nIn December 1607, Smith was looking for food and was captured by Native Americans. He was taken to meet the Chief of the Powhatan tribe. The village was about 15 miles from Jamestown. Smith was released without harm and gave credit in part to the chief's daughter, Pocahontas, who threw herself across his body. Seeing this, her father took mercy on Smith and he was safely taken back to Jamestown. This encounter began a friendly relationship between the natives, Smith and the colonists at Jamestown.\nIn early January 1608, nearly 100 new settlers arrived with Captain Newport, and through carelessness the village was set on fire. That winter the James River froze over, and the settlers were forced to live in the ruins. During this time, Newport and his crew wasted much time loading their ships with iron pyrite (fool's gold). Food supplies ran low and although the Native Americans brought some food, Smith wrote that \u201cmore than half of us died.\u201d \nIn April 1608 a ship brought supplies and 50 new settlers, whom Smith set to build housing and to plant crops.\nIn the summer of 1608, Smith left Jamestown to explore the Chesapeake Bay region and search for badly needed food. He made a map that would be of great value to Virginia explorers for over a century. In his absence, Smith left his friend Matthew Scrivener, as governor in his place. Scrivener would later drown in a storm in an ill-fated voyage to Hog Island. Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608 and instituted strict rules.\nIn October 1608, a ship arrived with 70 new settlers, including the first women. Some German and Polish craftsmen also arrived, but they brought no food supplies. After that, Smith tried to get food from the Native Americans and it took threats of military force for them to obey. Powhatan was frightened by the great number of white men coming into the area and was trying to starve them.\nSmith found that there were those among both the settlers and Native Americans who did not like his rules and were planning to kill him. Smith wrote that he was warned by Pocahontas. He called a meeting and told the men who did not work that \u201che that will not work shall not eat\u2026\u201d After that the situation improved.\nFor three months in early 1609, February, March and April all was well at Jamestown with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared and much other work done. Then in April, rats and dampness destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or they would have to leave the safety of the fort. Some left and went to the Native American villages, but Powhatan\u2019s people also went by Smith\u2019s law that he who works not, eats not. This was in effect until they were near starved and they returned home.\nAt some point an unexpected ship arrived, captained by Samuel Argall. He had food and wine which Smith bought with a promise to pay back. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company was sending more supplies and settlers to Jamestown along with a new governor, Lord De la Warr.\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Sir Thomas Smith, Virginia Company treasurer, arranged for about 500 colonists, including women and children to come along. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbor. The \"Sea Venture\" was shipwrecked on the Bermuda islands with the admiral and Stephen Hopkins on board. One year later, in May 1610, they had arrived at Jamestown in small boats they had made. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor, Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.\nIn August 1609 John Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive. London was sending new settlers with no planning as to how or where they would live.\nCapt. John Smith was severely injured by an accidental gunpowder explosion in his canoe. Smith sailed to England for treatment in October 1609. He had spent two and a half years trying to do his best for Jamestown. He never returned to Virginia. History has confirmed his great contribution at Jamestown in its earliest years.\nColonists would continue to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 of the 500 surviving that winter. In spite of this, the Virginia Company continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir Thomas Dale continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send to Jamestown.\nLater years.\nIn 1614, Smith returned to the northeast coast of America and named the region \"New England\". In that same year a storm destroyed his ship. In 1615, Smith was captured by French pirates off the coast of the Azore Islands. He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he wrote an account of his two voyages as Description of New England\". He never left England again. He died in the year 1631 in London at the age of 51. He is buried in the church of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in the City of London.\nThe Captain John Smith Monument currently lies off the coast of New Hampshire on Star Island, part of the Isles of Shoals. Built in 1864 to honor the 250th anniversary of John Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles.\nIn 1914, the New Hampshire Society of Colonial Wars partially restored and rededicated the monument for the 300th anniversary celebration of his historic visit. The monument had weathered so badly in the harsh coastal winters that the words carved in the granite had worn away."}
{"id": "243492", "revid": "535100", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243492", "title": "Entoprocta", "text": "Entoprocta, or Kamptozoa, is a phylum of tiny sessile aquatic animals ranging from 0.1 to 7 millimetres (0.004 to 0.28 in) long. Mature individuals are goblet-shaped, on relatively long stalks. They are filter-feeders, with a crown of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents towards the mouth. Both the mouth and anus lie inside the crown. The superficially similar Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) have the anus outside a 'crown' of hollow tentacles. Most families of entoprocts are colonial, and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine. A few solitary species can move slowly.\nSome species eject unfertilized ova into the water while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch, and some of these species use placenta-like organs to nourish the developing eggs. After hatching, the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface. There they metamorphose, and the larval gut generally rotates by up to 180\u00b0, so that the mouth and anus face upwards. Both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning.\nSome species of nudibranchs (sea slugs) and flatworms prey on entoprocts. A few entoproct species have been found living in close association with other animals. \nFossils of entoprocts are very rare and the earliest specimens that have been identified with confidence date from the Upper Jurassic. Most studies from 1996 onwards have regarded entoprocts as members of the Trochozoa, which also includes molluscs and annelids. However, a study in 2008 concluded that entoprocts are closely related to bryozoans.\nNames.\n'Entoprocta' means 'anus inside'. The alternative name 'Kamptozoa', means 'bent' or 'curved' animals. Some authors use \"Entoprocta\", while others prefer \"Kamptozoa\"."}

It is used mostly by Barnsley Football Club for playing their home games. It is also used by their reserve team.\nWhile the name \"Oakwell\" is usually used for the main stadium, it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley F.C. academy. This includes an indoor training pitch, a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2,200 spectators, and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley FC teams.\nUntil 2003 the stadium and the large amount of land that is around it was owned by Barnsley Football Club. However, after falling into administration in 2002 the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium. This allowed the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in The Football League.\nWest Stand.\nThe West Stand is the only original part of Oakwell Stadium left standing, however it was made 'all-seater' in 1995.\nThe stand is made up of two tiers, only the upper tier is covered but at the expense of several supporting columns for the roof structure, the seats are the originals from the early 1900s, from here you get a decent view with moderate legroom. In spite of the restricted views and modest facilities, the West Stand remains a popular vantage point for many fans. The lower tier of the West Stand is uncovered and offers a great view of the action.\nThe roof of the West Stand is corrugated iron this also houses the main television gantry which is accessed from the upper level seating area by a temporary ladder.\nAt the end of the 1990s, the then-stadium owners Barnsley Football Club were considering re-developing the West Stand after several seasons of high attendances. However, with the rapid decline in fortunes of the football club, and sale of the stadium and new club ownership these plans are unlikely to happen in the near future.\nThe stand also has a traditional players tunnel in the centre. This is used for access to some of the facilities underneath the stand. The main players tunnel now comes out from the north-west corner following the moving of the changing rooms to the North Stand.\nThe West Stand has a total seating capacity of 4,752.\nEast Stand.\nThe East Stand is a two level development completed in 1993. Funded in part by the football trust, the stand has a capacity of 7,492 and replaced a large covered terrace known as the Brewery Stand. The East Stand was designed by NYP Architects,as was the North Stand and the Corner Stand. With the completion of the East Stand, Barnsley FC became the first football club in Yorkshire to add 'executive boxes' into their stadium. The East stand is very modern, and has plenty of legroom.\nDue to the sloped land on which Oakwell Stadium is built, the rear of the East Stand is much taller than it is from the pitchside. This means a climb to the upper level seating area requires many more steps than a spectator may anticipate. However several lifts are available.\nThe CK Beckett Stand.\nBuilt in 1995, CK Beckett is the current name for what is traditionally known as the 'Pontefract Road End' or 'Ponty End'. Some fans continue to call it the 'ORA Stand' - in reference to the original sponsors of it. Also, known as the Van Damme Stand.\nWith a capacity of 4,508, The CK Beckett Stand is a large covered single tier seating area behind the goal on the south side of the stadium.\nThis part of the stadium also houses the players gym, the club superstore, box office, and general administration offices.\nIt is understood that this stand had been designed specifically with future development in mind, therefore should the club ever have the need to increase the grounds capacity then it would be fundamentally possible to add a second tier without making any major alterations to the existing structure.\nThe North Stand.\nThe North Stand is the most recent addition to Oakwell Stadium and is a large covered singled tiered seating area with a capacity for 6,000 spectators.\nAs this stand is generally reserved for away supporters its capacity is rarely utilized, although during the 2006/07 season, Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Birmingham and Sunderland fans all filled the end, Sunderland also took up half of the West Stand. In the 2009/10 season, Newcastle United filled the stand.\nAt a cost of \u00a34.5\u00a0million (including several academy facilities that it accommodates), it has been a cause for debate ever since its construction. However at the time it was built, Barnsley FC had only just been demoted from the FA Premier League and were planning for a possible return.\nThe Corner Stand.\nThe Corner Stand was built in the summer of 1998. It was originally known as 'The Welcome Windows Stand'. It is an unusual three level structure. It provides further executive areas and disabled facilities for viewing an event.\nAccess to this area was also added into the neighbouring East Stand on several levels. The spectator capacity of the structure is 202.\nOther uses.\nIn recent years Oakwell Stadium has rarely been used by anyone other than Barnsley FC. The occasional celebrity charity football match has been played there.\nWakefield Trinity Wildcats Rugby League Club used the stadium for their first game in the Super League (Europe) in 1998.\nNon-league football club Wakefield and Emley used the stadium for an FA Cup tie against Rotherham in 1998, choosing a larger neutral venue as opposed to the traditional option of 'switching' the tie to the home of the team which was drawn away.\nPremier League side Manchester City used the stadium for their first qualifying round UEFA Cup game in July 2008. This was because the pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium was not ready for football games after the summer's boxing and music concerts.\nFuture developments.\nIn March 2008, club secretary Don Rowing revealed that the West Stand would be demolished and rebuilt. Given that the average gate at Barnsley accounts for less than 50% of capacity this appeared to be a strange announcement, however there are a number of structural concerns with the roof and the wooden floor of the upper tier and it would seem that a new structure is more financially viable than maintaining the existing one.\nNo firm timescales or details of the structure have yet been released. Plans for a replacement stand were submitted to the local council several years ago, in this particular case the stand was to have around 9,000 seats - it remains to be seen whether such a large stand would be built. Given the current attendance figures then a new stand with around the same capacity as the existing West Stand would be more than viable.\nTragedy.\nOn 27 December 1920, Horace Fairhurst, a young full-back for the visiting Blackpool, received a blow to the head during a league game. He died at home eleven days later as a result of the injury."}

Manchester is a city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England. It is made up of 96 councillors. There are three for each of the 32 wards. Currently the council is controlled by the Labour Party. It is led by Sir Richard Leese. Much of the council and local civil service is located at Manchester Town Hall and the Town Hall Extension, in the city's commercial centre.\nHistory.\nManchester was incorporated in 1838 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as the Corporation of Manchester or Manchester Corporation. It gained city status in 1853. It was only the second such grant since the Reformation. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the council was reconstituted as a metropolitan borough council in 1974. The area included in the city has been increased many times. In 1885 (Bradford, Harpurhey and Rusholme), 1890 (Blackley, Crumpsall, part of Droylsden, Kirkmanshulme, Moston, Newton Heath, Openshaw, and West Gorton), 1903 (Heaton), 1904 (Burnage, Chorlton cum Hardy, Didsbury, and Moss Side), 1909 (Gorton, and Levenshulme), 1931\n(Wythenshawe: Baguley, Northenden, and Northern Etchells), and Ringway. A new Town Hall was opened in 1877 (by Alderman Abel Heywood) and the Mayor of Manchester was granted the title of Lord Mayor in 1893.\nPolitical makeup.\nElections are usually by thirds. A third of the seats elected, three years in every four. In the 2004 elections, due to a lot of boundary changes (which involved the total number of councillors reduced) all seats were contested.\nThe council has been controlled by the Labour Party since its reconstitution in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972.\nCoat of arms.\n\"Gules, three bendlets enhanced Or; a chief argent, thereon on waves of the sea a ship under sail proper.

It went platinum in the UK.\nPre-release.\nA handful of fans-only private screenings took place around the world. The world premiere of the movie at the Directors Guild Theater in New York City on 4 November 2006 as part of the CMJ Film Festival. The UK television premiere was on Channel 4 on 19 November, at 11:50PM. It was a heavily edited version with about 40 minutes cut from the original 95 minute version. The movie was first shown to go along with Oasis' compilation album \"Stop the Clocks\", released on 20 November 2006. A preview of the movie was included on the Let There Be Love DVD single, released in November 2005.\nThe movie features a new Oasis song also called \"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\", written by Noel Gallagher and recorded during the Don't Believe the Truth sessions. Gallagher described it as being \"one of the best things, like The Who, The Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group combined, and it's got two drum solos on it!\". He has also said that his girlfriend thought it was the only Oasis song you could dance to. The song was left off \"Don't Believe the Truth\" because Gallagher felt that including it would have meant he'd have been singing too many songs on the record.

Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods perform well.\nVelvet is made, ideally, from silk. More recently, synthetic velvets have been developed, mostly polyester, nylon, viscose, acetate, and mixtures of different synthetics, or synthetics and natural fibers (e.g. viscose and silk). A small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch.\nHistory.\nThe art of velvet-weaving probably originated in medieval Kashmir around the beginning of the fourteenth century.

Most of the 1,400 or so species are marine, with a few living in fresh water and a small number of terrestrial forms. They live in all marine habitats, and throughout the world's oceans. Alternative spellings for the phylum have included \"Nemertini\" and \"Nemertinea\". \"Rhynchocoela\" is a name used primarily in North America but gradually abandoned since the 1980s.\nAnatomy.\nNemertean worms are long, thin, animals without segments. They have no true head, although the anterior end is often slightly wider than the body. They are distinguished by the presence of an eversible proboscis. This is kept inside the body, but pushed out to catch prey.\nNemerteans collect food with their proboscis, which is closely associated with the digestive system. At rest, the proboscis is inside a long tube that may take up a considerable portion of the worm's length, lying just above the gut. It is attached to the posterior end of this tube by a muscle that pulls it back inside after feeding.

There are different ways to improve reading speed, but they are all similar. A trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute, for a text that is not very difficult to understand. Better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute. Using a lot of exercise, it is possible to increase reading speed further. The best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute, and understand about 80% of them.\nHow do people read.\nIn general, only a small part of the letters read are seen clearly. The brain guesses what the rest of the word is, based on a small part of the word. This also applies to groups of words, which are treated the same way. Known groups are handled faster, because the reader knows them, and also has an \"image\" for them. \nWhat is very important when reading text is the ability to recognize words and word groups. The reader will then add the known image to the context. A known font can help this. \nWhat is bad for speed reading is having a bad short-term memory. Another factor is a small vocabulary. People who only know few words, need more time to \"scan\" unknown words, simply because fewer words in the text are known."}

It was home to Manchester City F.C. from when it was built in 1923 until 2003. It takes its name from the street it was built on which also had a remarkable history. The street was first known as Dog Kennel Lane. It formed part of an ancient route south of Manchester.\nWhen first opened, the stadium was the largest club ground in England and the second largest in the country after Wembley Stadium. Maine Road's record attendance was set in 1934, when 84,569 people attended an FA Cup tie between Manchester City and Stoke City. It is the record for an English club ground (the 1923 FA Cup Final holds the world record). The following February the stadium recorded the highest Football League attendance. This stood at 79,491 for a game against Arsenal. The record has since been beaten for the League, but it is still Manchester City's largest League crowd. The design of the ground changed several times over its 80-year history. Before it closed, Maine Road was an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 35,150.\nThe 2002-03 season was Manchester City's last at Maine Road. The last match was played on 11 May 2003. The following season Manchester City moved to City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester. Maine Road was torn down in 2004.\nConstruction.\nPlans to build Maine Road were first announced in May 1922. It came after a decision by Manchester City F.C. to leave their Hyde Road ground. Hyde Road did not have room for expansion and had been damaged by fire in 1920. Two sites in Belle Vue, East Manchester were suggested, but neither was considered good enough. To many City fans east Manchester was thought of as City's home. Many were disappointed when a site in south Manchester was chosen. A City director, John Ayrton, resigned from the Board later in the decade and helped to form an alternative MCFC, Manchester Central F.C., playing at Belle Vue.\nA sixteen and a quarter acre former brickworking on Maine Road was purchased for \u00a35,500. Maine Road had first been known as Dog Kennel Lane. It was renamed Maine Road during the 1870s because of pressure from the Temperance Movement.\nStadium construction began late in 1922. Plans by architect Charles Swain proposed a 120,000 capacity ground based on the design of Hampden Park. These plans were reduced to give a capacity of 80,000. However, this figure was still the second largest in the country, behind Wembley Stadium, leading to a label of \"The Wembley of the North\". Wembley had opened in London only a few months earlier. This made a source of rivalry between the northern and southern divisions of builders Sir Robert McAlpine, who built both stadia. During construction, the stadium was supposedly cursed by a gypsy when Manchester City officials evicted a gypsy camp from the area. This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998. However, the gypsy curse is likely to be an urban myth, as such stories are endemic to a number of football league grounds. Construction took 300 days. The total cost \u00a3100,000. The first layout of the ground was one covered stand with a seating capacity of 10,000. It had uncovered terracing on the other three sides, with gentle curves connecting the corners.\nEarly years.\nThe first match at Maine Road took place on 25 August 1923, and saw 58,159 fans watch the home side beat Sheffield United 2-1.\nThe first changes to the ground took place in 1931, when the corner between the Main Stand and the Platt Lane end at the south of the ground was rebuilt to incorporate a roof. The highest attendance at an English football game of any type at a club ground was at Maine Road on the March 3, 1934, when Manchester City played Stoke City in front of 84,569 fans in the 6th round of the FA Cup. Changes at the Platt Lane end took place in 1935, extending the terracing and providing a roof for the full stand. This marked the peak capacity of the ground, estimated at around 88,000. Further changes were planned, but were suspended when Manchester City were relegated from Division One in 1938, and abandoned when World War II broke out. \nThe stadium was shared by Manchester United for a period after the Second World War, since Manchester United's Old Trafford ground had been partially destroyed during the Manchester Blitz. United paid City \u00a35,000 per season, plus a share of gate receipts. The highest attendance for a League game at Maine Road occurred during this period, when 83,260 people watched Manchester United play Arsenal on January 17, 1948. This figure is a national record for a League game.\nFloodlights were installed in 1953, and in 1957, prompted by the hosting of two FA Cup semi-finals in successive years, the side facing the Main Stand (which until that time was generally known as the \"Popular Side\") was redeveloped and named \"The Kippax Stand\" after a nearby street. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Kippax became the part of the ground where the club's most vociferous fans congregated. In 1963, benches were installed at the Platt Lane end, meaning that Maine Road had more seats than any other English club ground of the time. The next major redevelopment came in the 1970s, with the construction of the North Stand, a cantilevered stand which remained in place until the closure of Maine Road. The 1980s saw ambitious plans for improvements: however, these plans were shelved due to financial pressures after the Main Stand roof had been replaced at a cost of \u00a31 million.\nRegeneration.\nBy 1990, some areas of the ground looked antiquated, and the Platt Lane stand was demolished in 1992. Its place was taken by the all-seater \"Umbro Stand\" that also incorporated executive boxes, and was opened in March 1993. The stand was renamed back to the \"Platt Lane Stand\" in the late 1990s.\nThe era of standing accommodation at Maine Road came to an end in May 1994 as the stadium became all-seater to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report with the demolition of the \"Kippax Street Terrace\". The final match where standing was permitted took place on 30 April 1994, Chelsea the visitors for a 2\u20132 draw. Immediately prior to demolition the capacity of the Kippax terrace was 18,300. A three-tier stand was built in its place, holding nearly 14,000 spectators, and on its completion in October 1995 it was the tallest stand in the country.\nThe new stand was an impressive modern facility, but it also emphasised the haphazard nature in which the ground had been redeveloped, as all four sides were of differing heights and construction styles. There were further plans for expansion which would have taken the stadium's capacity to 45,000, but these were put on hold following City's relegation from the Premier League in 1996.\nThe move to the City of Manchester Stadium.\nThere were plans for further expansion at Maine Road to take the capacity to 45,000 all-seated, but these were abandoned in favour of a move to the City of Manchester Stadium that was being constructed for the Commonwealth Games in 2002.\nThe final competitive match before the closure of the stadium took place on 11 May 2003. Manchester City ended the Maine Road era with a 1-0 defeat to Southampton, with Michael Svensson scoring the stadium's last goal. The final match was followed by short performances by musical acts Badly Drawn Boy and Doves.\nCity's final goal at the stadium was scored on 26 April 2003 by Marc-Vivien Foe, who died on 26 June that year from an undetected heart condition while representing the Cameroon national football team.\nToward the end of Maine Road's lifespan there were proposals for other sports teams to make use of the stadium following City's relocation; Stockport County once expressed interest in moving there from Edgeley Park, and in December 2000 Sale Sharks rugby union club was offered a lease for the stadium. However, none of the proposals came to fruition.\nAn auction of the ground's fixtures and fittings took place in July 2003, raising \u00a3100,000, which was donated to community projects in the Moss Side area, which was undergoing a lengthy regeneration process. Demolition began in late 2003, taking seven months. Two years later the go-ahead was given for a new housing development to take part on the site, consisting of 474 homes.\nPitch.\nFor long periods of its history Maine Road had the widest pitch in England. However, the width was changed several times by managers wishing to alter the pitch size to suit their style of play. In the final season before the ground was closed, the pitch size was 107 x 71\u00a0metres (116.5 x 78\u00a0yards).\nOther uses.\nMaine Road hosted two England internationals, the first was a 3-0 defeat of Wales on November 13, 1946 and the second a 9-2 win over Northern Ireland on November 16, 1949, England's first ever World Cup qualifier. In addition, A number of wartime internationals were held at the ground. Maine Road was also the venue for a number of rugby league matches, hosting the rugby league championship final eleven times between 1938 and 1956.\nThe stadium was used for several scenes in the 1948 motion picture \"Cup-tie Honeymoon\". More recently, it was featured in the 2000 film \"There's Only One Jimmy Grimble\" and the 2003 ITV drama \"The Second Coming\", which starred Christopher Eccleston.\nMaine Road has also played host to a number of rock concerts, including The Rolling Stones, Simple Minds, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, Bryan Adams, Jean Michel Jarre, Dire Straits, David Bowie &amp; Guns N' Roses.\nIn 1974, teen idol David Cassidy played the stadium.\nThe most high profile concert held at Maine Road was that of Mancunian band Oasis (themselves avowed Manchester City fans) in April 1996, a performance which was later released as a video, \"Oasis:...There and Then\".\nPrince also played the stadium twice in the early 1990s.\nMaine Road Football Club.\nMaine Road also gives its name to a non-league football club, Maine Road F.C.. The club, who currently play in the North West Counties Football League Division One, was founded by a group of Manchester City supporters in 1955. The club previously based its headquarters at the social club adjoining Maine Road."}

It is UEFA's second-tier club football tournament. The match was played at the City of Manchester Stadium. It is the home stadium of Manchester City F.C., in Manchester, England, at 20:45 CEST (19:45 local time) on 14 May 2008.\nThe match was played by Zenit St. Petersburg of Russia and Rangers of Scotland. It was called a battle of Rangers coaching staff, with ex-boss Dick Advocaat, currently the manager of Zenit against current boss Walter Smith. Smith has had two times as manager of Rangers. Both coaches led the Rangers to the Scottish domestic treble; Smith in 1993 and Advocaat in 1999.\nZenit won the match 2\u20130. They had goals from Igor Denisov and Konstantin Zyryanov. It was their first UEFA Cup title. It made them only the second Russian side to win the competition, after CSKA Moscow in 2004\u201305.\nThe logo of the final shows a picture of the City of Manchester Stadium, created by English artist Liam Spencer. It was first shown at a ceremony in the stadium on December 6.\nPre-match.\nZenit and Michel Platini asked the British government to ease visa procedures for Russian fans, despite Russia having cancelled visas for British fans travelling to 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow. However, the Director for British Visa Services for the CIS, Mandy Ivemy, said that \"for the U.K. government, visas and biometric checks are a vital part of immigration policy, and we are not prepared to waive them\".\nMeanwhile, there was a mass flow of Rangers fans into Manchester. Over a hundred thousand supporters 'invaded' the city despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans to stay at home. The influx of people resulted in there being no vacant hotel rooms in a twenty-mile radius of the city and the total amount of money that was ploughed into the local economy was estimated to be around \u00a325 million.\nRangers' home ground, Ibrox, was opened to show a live beamback of the match to approximately 30,000 spectators. Fans queued overnight for a seat in the stadium. The capacity was reached more than two hours before kick-off.\nMatch.\nTeam news.\nZenit St. Petersburg were without the competition's top scorer, Pavel Pogrebnyak, who had picked up two bookings in the knockout stages of the tournament and was therefore suspended. However, they were able to call upon their other star names such as attacking midfielders Andrei Arshavin and Konstantin Zyryanov, as well as holding midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk.\nRangers manager Walter Smith started with Jean-Claude Darcheville on his own up-front, with a five-man midfield supporting him comprising Steven Davis, Kevin Thomson, Steven Whittaker, Barry Ferguson and Brahim Hemdani. Neil Alexander was making only his tenth start in goal for Rangers, first choice keeper Allan McGregor was injured.\nFan violence.\nThe event was marred by fans rioting in Manchester city centre; these riots started after a big screen that was due to show the match had failed. BBC News 24 interrupted normal programming to broadcast the riots live on television. ITN's flagship News at Ten programme gave a lot of coverage to the riots.\nA Zenit fan was also attacked and stabbed. Six Rangers fans were arrested on suspicion of grevious bodily harm."}

Their name comes from the title of The Flaming Lips album, \"Hit to Death in the Future Head\".\nCareer.\nEarly days.\nThe band met at City of Sunderland College as a quartet consisting of Barry Hyde (vocals and guitar), David \"Jaff\" Craig (bass), Peter Brewis (drums), and Ross Millard (vocals and guitar). Millard and Craig had been in another local band together before. They used the Sunderland City Detached Youth Project building (where Brewis and Hyde worked) as a free practice space. The project was meant to get young people off the streets by using music. They first performed in 2000. The reputation in the area grew through word-of-mouth. Hyde's younger brother Dave replaced Brewis (who went on to form Field Music).\nIn an interview with Channel 4's \"4Music\", Barry Hyde said that Dave Hyde was given a golden guitar by his parents when he was young. But Barry had taken it off him to learn to strum his first chords. Dave was left with nothing, forcing him to take up the drums.\n2003-2005; self titled first album.\nThe Futureheads played their first gig at Ashbrooke Cricket and Rugby Club in December, 2000. They debuted with their \"Nul Book Standard\" EP and then their \"123 Nul EP\" on March 10, 2003. Later that year they released their first single, \"First Day,\" on August 4.\nThe Futureheads released their self-titled debut album in September, 2004 on 679 recordings. Five tracks of the tracks were produced by Andy Gill of Gang of Four. The rest of the album was produced by Paul Epworth. The song \"Decent Days And Nights\" from the album was featured in the video game soundtrack to \"\" on PlayStation 2 and Xbox as well as EA's \"Rugby 2005\".\nOn February 21, 2005, \"Hounds of Love\", a cover of a Kate Bush song, was released as a single. It reached number eight in the UK Singles Chart in its first week. It was named Best Single of 2005 by \"NME\". The band toured the United States. They later supported the Pixies, Foo Fighters and Snow Patrol.\nThey performed at BBC Radio One's One Big Weekend, held in their home town of Sunderland over the weekend of May 7-8, 2005. On May 8, 2005 Sunderland A.F.C. picked up the Coca-Cola Championship trophy. In tribute, the Futureheads performed a set live at the Stadium of Light as pre-match entertainment.\n2005-2006; \"News and Tributes\".\nThe stand-alone EP, \"Area\" was released in November, 2005 while the band was working on their second album \"News and Tributes\". According to \"NME\" in February, 2006, it took only five weeks to make. The first single from the album was \"Skip to the End\" released on May 15. The album \"News and Tributes\" was first released on May 29, 2006.\nThe band became bothered by major label music business and being under contract were very lucky to be set free by 679 Recordings. Hyde said \"we were desperate to get out of the record deal, they could easily have kept us and made us try and make more records but we didn't want that'\n2006-2008; \"This Is Not the World\".\nThroughout the rest of 2006, The Futureheads started their own independent record label, Nul Records, and started working on songs for their next album.\nIn June, 2007, they reportedly completed work on their third album, \"This Is Not the World,\" which was released in May, 2008. Millard said that he expected the new album to be punkier than the last album. He also said that the band was close to splitting during the time after the second album was released. \nThe band made a free download called \"Broke Up The Time\" available from their website on November 9, 2007. They also announced three gigs in the UK followed by a full UK tour. They now have their own label, Nul Records, set up exclusively to distribute Futureheads material. In December, 2007 the band released a video of them walking around Carnaby Street, London to the single \"The Beginning of the Twist.\" It was also accompanied by a free download of a song called \"Crash.\"\nThe second single from their album \"Radio Heart\" was released on May 19, 2008 from their album \"This Is Not The World\" followed by the release of the music video for the single on April 16.

Six fragments of fossil skull bone discovered in Australia (Queensland) may indicate that dicynodonts survived much longer, until about 150 million years ago (the Cretaceous period) in the region called the southern Gondwana.\nThe dicynodonts were a group of therapsids, but were not ancestors to the mammals. The group which evolved into mammals was the cynodonts."}

He also had a passion for the ocean, and even used his talents to design racing yachts. \nSiri\u2019s spirit and originality did not disappoint. From its earliest days, architects and passersby alike were intrigued by surprises in the buildings' construction. Rising dramatically from the shore of the historic Potomac River, two distinct structures dominated the triangular block of land: a circular council chamber and an 11-story crescent-shaped secretariat. By December 1964, texture and pattern had begun to emerge, giving each building a distinct character. Geometric diamond shapes decorated the outside of the council chamber, visually played off against the elegant vertical lines of the larger secretariat building. Gradually, other elements were added: reflecting pools, white columns, and slim concrete fins that gave the buildings a soaring quality. \nJust over two years after work began, the completed secretariat was ready to house hundreds of staff members in approximately 170,000 square feet of space, furnished with marble, paintings, sculptures, and other gifts from PAHO member nations. \nThe council chamber alone could accommodate 400 delegates within its circular walls.

When light is shone through the photomask, certain parts where the light hits the unused circuit board are strengthened, much like what toothpaste does to the hard surfaces your teeth. When a circuit board is put through an acid bath, the parts where the light shone through the photomask stay in place, while the parts that were covered by the shadow of the photomask are eaten away by the acid. There are two prominent types of masks. \"Contact\" masks, which touch the surface of the silicon wafer directly. These masks are cheaper, at the price of being less precise. \"Proximity\" masks are placed near to, but not touching the wafer. These masks are much more expensive, but also a lot more precise. Another type is \"Projection\" masks, also known as \"reticles\", which only contain the pattern of one chip, instead of the pattern of the whole wafer."}

Marine species are found mostly in between sediment particles, while terrestrial species live in the water films around grains of soil. Adults have a fixed cell number. About 700 species have been described.\nAnatomy.\nGastrotrichs are bilaterally symmetric, with a transparent body and a flat underside. Many species have a pair of short projections at the rear end. The body is covered with cilia, especially about the mouth and on the lower surface. Its two end projections have cement glands. This is a double-gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de-adhesive. Like many microscopic animals, their movement is mainly powered by hydrostatics.\nGastrotrichs develop to a particular number of cells; further growth comes only from an increase in cell size. As is typical for such small animals, there are no respiratory or circulatory organs. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one on either side of the pharynx. Each ganglion gives rise to a single nerve cord, which runs the length of the body and includes further, smaller ganglia. The main sense organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface. Some gastrotrichs also possess light sensitive cells in the brain that work as primitive ocelli (eye spots).\nReproduction.\nGastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites: they have both male and female sex organs. Once the sperm are produced, they are picked up by an organ on the tail that functions as a penis, and transferred to the partner. Fertilisation is internal, and the eggs are released by rupture of the body wall.\nMany species reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species the male portions of the reproductive system are non-functional or entirely absent.\nSome species can lay eggs that can remain dormant during times of desiccation (drought) or cold. These species produce regular eggs during good environmental conditions, which hatch in one to four days. The eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days, and gastrotrichs can live up to ten days under laboratory conditions.\nEutely.\nGastrotrichs are eutelic: each species has a genetically fixed number of cells as adults. Cell division stops at the end of embryonic development and further growth is only by cell enlargement."}

{"id": "244025", "revid": "6620179", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244025", "title": "Hand axe", "text": " \nA hand axe is a stone tool of the Lower (early) and Middle Paleolithic Stone Age. It was a bifacial, similar on both sides, and held in the hand, not with a handle like a modern axe. It was held directly in the hand, perhaps wrapped in a piece of leather.\nThis kind of axe is typical of the Acheulean and the Mousterian cultures, and is the longest-used tool of human history. Hand axes were certainly used for at least a million and a half years. They were made by earlier species of man, such as \"Homo erectus\" and \"Homo neanderthalensis\" (Neanderthal Man); it was one of their most important tools. The hand axe cultures were preceded by an even older Oldowan culture of primitive stone tools (2.6 to 1.7 million years ago) in Africa. Now it is known that the first stone tools were probably made by Australopithecines. They are found in the Great Rift Valley of Africa from about 3.3 million years ago.\nNew archaeological evidence from Baise, Guangxi, China shows that there were occasional hand axes in eastern Asia. However, as the reference shows, the artifacts were overwhelmingly choppers and flakes. The authors say \"The stone tool assemblage shows close associations with the pebble tool industry... in South China\".\nA line known as the Movius Line divides the Old World into two parts: to the west are the hand axe areas, and to the east are the chopper or flak-and-chip areas. It is supposed that there were at least two different cultural traditions.\nProduction.\nOlder hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. Later Mousterian handaxes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border.\nAn experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe. A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.\nRaw materials.\nHand axes are mainly made of flint, but rhyolites, phonolites, quartzites and other rather coarse rocks were used as well. It depends what rocks were available in the vicinity. Obsidian was rarely used, because it is not widely found. It produces a brilliant blade, but shatters more easily than flint.\nShapes.\nSeveral basic shapes, like cordate, oval, or triangular have been distinguished, but their significance is not agreed upon.\nFunction.\nHand axes were no doubt a multi-purpose tool. Research on their cutting edges has shown that, in many cases, they were used for butchering meat. This would include extracting bone marrow (which would explain the pointed end) and general hacking through bone, muscle and tendons. Experiments at Boxgrove quarry would appear to back this up. We know for sure that Neanderthals, at least, were hunters of large mammals such as mammoths, and that may be true of other hand axe cultures. The need for such a heavy tool is thus easily understood. Wielding a hand axe requires considerable strength, but Neanderthals were stronger than us in their upper bodies.\nStudies in the 1990s at Boxgrove, in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe, showed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow, which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was highly prized as a food source."}

At the age of 14, after being spotted by songwriter Jimmy Webb's father, he was signed to a recording contract, and seemed to be destined for stardom. Scarbury's first single, \"She Never Smiles Anymore,\" flopped, and he was soon without a record label. \nScarbury, undaunted by what happened, stayed in music up through the 1970s singing backup for artists like Loretta Lynn, and occasionally recording his own material. Although he had a minor chart single with \"Mixed Up Guy\" in 1971, real chart success eluded him for the rest of the decade. This was to change when he started working for record producer and composer Mike Post. Post was hired along with Stephen Geyer to write the theme tune for a new TV series dubbed \"The Greatest American Hero\", about a high school teacher who comes into possession of a superhero outfit, and Scarbury was chosen to record it. An extended version of the song (3:15 compared to the television theme's minute-long length), released by Elektra Records, shot up to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. \nScarbury could not follow it up however, and after charting at #49 with the single \"When She Dances\", Scarbury disappeared again from the charts. Scarbury went on to work with Post again in the mid 1980s to record the song \"Back to Back\", for the television series \"Hardcastle and McCormick\" and teamed up with Desiree Goyette to record \"Flashbeagle\" for the Peanuts special \"It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown\". He also performed the opening theme for the television series \"Jennifer Slept Here\".\nIn 1990, Scarbury found success again as a songwriter. This time, his co-written song \"No Matter How High\" was recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys and was a number one country music hit. His co-writer on this song was Even Stevens who previously had found success with co-writing songs for country star Eddie Rabbitt, as well as the Kenny Rogers hit \"Love Will Turn You Around\" from the motion picture \"Six Pack\".\nHis hit song from \"The Greatest American Hero\" appeared in Michael Moore's film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" on the scene when President George W. Bush declares the Iraq Mission Accomplished.\nIn 2008, Joey was back on the radio after a long absence. His single \"How Do You Sleep At Night\" broke the top 40.\nDiscography.\nScarbury has released several singles starting in 1969 on Dunhill, followed by releases on Reena, Playboy, Bell, Columbia, RCA, Big Tree, Lionel, and Elektra labels.&lt;br&gt;\n1 ALBUM: (1981) \"America's Greatest Hero\""}
{"id": "244070", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244070", "title": "Kenny Rankin", "text": "Kenny Rankin (February 10, 1940 - June 7, 2009) was an American pop and jazz singer and songwriter. He was originally from the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, New York.\nBiography.\nRankin was raised in New York and was introduced to music by his mother, who sang at home and for friends. The area of Washington Heights, Manhattan was becoming heavily Latino during his youth, and exposure to street music may have played a part. He began recording at age 17 (1957), eventually working as a songwriter contracted to Columbia Records. Rankin's earliest composition, \"My Carousel\" was written for Carmen McRae, followed by \"A Happy Guy\" for teen idol Rick Nelson. He had already developed a serious amphetamine problem by that time.\nHe taught himself classical guitar, at age 24, inspired by the playing of Don Costa, who had started on that instrument before becoming one of the most important arrangers in popular music. He played rhythm guitar on some tracks on Bob Dylan's album Bringing it All Back Home (1965). Rankin developed a considerable following during the 70s with a steady flow of albums, three of which broke into the Top 100 of the Billboard Album Chart. His liking for jazz was evident from an early age, but the times were such that in order to survive his career had to take a more pop-oriented course, and he cited singer-songwriter Laura Nyro consistently as a major influence. \nRankin appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson more than twenty times. Carson was so impressed by him that he wrote the liner notes to Rankin's 1967 debut album \"Mind Dusters,\" which featured the single \"Peaceful.\" Rankin's friend Helen Reddy would reach #2 Adult Contemporary and #12 Pop in 1973 with a cover of it, released as her follow-up single to \"I Am Woman\". Georgie Fame also had a hit with this song in 1969, his only songwriting credit to hit the British charts reaching number sixteen and spending 9 weeks on the chart. \nRankin's original song \"In the Name of Love\" frequently featured wordless improvisational singing and showed his range and command of articulating lyrics at a blistering waltz tempo, but performed more slowly it had a distinctly Brazilian flavor. Similar to later singer Mandy Patinkin, Rankin's speaking voice was a rich baritone, but his tessitura was an octave higher, with an occasional start at near his speaking timbre, as in \"What Matters Most.\" The timbre of his singing voice most frequently resembled that of a clarinet. His remarkably quick mastery of the guitar allowed him to appear, along with Randy Newman and Joni Mitchell, as one of the few self-sufficient solo acts conveying original material with harmonic richness beyond that of folk and early rock music.\nHe was extremely private in his early televised interviews, once stating that personal information distracted from musical performance, and thus even his date of birth was considered anecdotal information. Later, he became more open and stated in interviews that in the 60s and 70s he had suffered from serious addictions which affected his career, and he credited his family, and a period of spiritual study while undergoing rehabilitation sessions, for helping him to overcome his drug and alcohol problems by the early 80s. Some recorded songs on the Little David record label (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) featured his wife Yvonne and his daughters singing background, as the Rankin Family Band. His album \"Family\" featured cover art of Rankin holding his two young daughters. The Rankins also had a son. \nOccasionally criticised for poor choice of material, considering his talents, by the 90s, he was able to angle his repertoire to accommodate his own musical preferences and to please a new audience while still keeping faith with the faithful. Rankin's warm singing style and his soft, nylon-stringed guitar sound might suggest an artist more attuned to the supper-club circuit than the jazz arena, but his work contains many touches that appeal to the jazz audience, especially as he introduced more \"standards\" from the 30s and 40s into his performances. Reviews in the periodical Down Beat and later print media increasingly reinforced his jazz credentials.\nRankin's song \"Haven't We Met\" was performed by Mel Torm\u00e9 and Carmen McRae, while Stan Getz said of him that he was \"a horn with a heartbeat\". Rankin's accompanists have from time to time included pianists Alan Broadbent, Mike Wofford and trombonist Bill Watrous, and on such occasions the mood slips easily into a jazz groove. But Don Costa's full orchestral arrangements were used to back his voice to critical acclaim, following a trend in the wake of Harry Nilsson with Gordon Jenkins and Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle, to emulate the lush soundscape that some say reached its apogee with Frank Sinatra's Capitol recordings. Rankin was also deeply interested in Brazilian music and his \"Here In My Heart,\" on which he used jazz guests including Michael Brecker and Ernie Watts, was recorded mostly in Rio de Janeiro. More contemporary songs were given an airing following his move to Verve Records, including the Beatles' \"I've Just Seen A Face\" and Leon Russell's \"A Song For You.\"\nRankin's own unique gift for reworking classic songs such as The Beatles' \"Blackbird,\" which he recorded for his \"Silver Morning\" album, so impressed Paul McCartney that he asked Rankin to perform his interpretation of the song when McCartney and John Lennon were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nRankin was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in May 2009. He died in Los Angeles, California - where he had resided for many years - from the disease on June 7, 2009. He was 69 years old.\nReferences.\nYanow, Scott, The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide, Backbeat Books, 2008.\nKort, Michael, Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro, Thomas Dunne Books / St. Martin's Press, 2002."}

He is a former Olympic, Commonwealth, European and World champion. He has held the world record in the event since 1995.\nAfter his retirement as an athlete, Edwards has worked as an athletics commentator and presenter for BBC television. He was a devout Christian. He presented episodes of the BBC Christian worship programme \"Songs of Praise\". He lost faith in 2007. He was a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games in 2012. He is President of the Wenlock Olympian Society.\nEducation.\nEdwards attended West Buckland School where his ability in the triple jump was seen at an early age. He was a strong all-rounder and on leaving received the school's top award for sporting and academic excellence, the Fortescue Medal. Other students with Edwards at West Buckland School included Victor Ubogu and Steve Ojomoh. Both are former Bath and England Rugby international players. Edwards now has a Sports Hall at West Buckland named after him; \"The Jonathan Edwards Sports Centre\". Edwards then read Physics at Durham University, attending Van Mildert College.\nAthletics career.\nBecause of his strong Christian beliefs, he refused to compete on Sundays at first. Eventually he decided to do so in 1993. This decision proved important, since the qualifying round at that year's World Championships took place on a Sunday. He went on to win the bronze medal.\nIn his breakthrough year of 1995, he produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5\u00bd inches) at the European Cup. The leap was wind assisted and did not count for record purposes. But it was a sign of things to come as he capped an unbeaten year. He had a historic gold medal performance at the World Championships. There he broke the world record twice in the same meet. On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier (18.16 m/59 feet 7\u00a0inches). That record lasted for about 20 minutes. His second jump of 18.29 m made him the first to jump 60 feet. During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards said that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if \"he could jump as far as he needed to\". Later the same year Edwards became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\nDuring 1996 Edwards went into the Olympic games as favourite and world record holder. But it was American Kenny Harrison who took the gold with a jump of 18.09 m. Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 17.88 m (the longest ever jump not to win gold). Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. He was awarded the CBE shortly afterwards. He also won golds at the 2001 World Championships and 2002 Commonwealth Games. At one point in 2002, Edwards held all the gold medals for the \"four majors\" (Olympic Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games &amp; European Championships). He retired after the 2003 World Championships as Great Britain's most successful medal winning athlete.\nPost-athletics career.\nFollowing his retirement, Edwards pursued a media career as a television presenter. He worked mainly for the BBC as a sports commentator and on programmes such as \"Songs of Praise\". He gave up this programme, due to his loss of faith, in February 2007.\nIn 2004 Edwards joined with Paula Radcliffe on an \"Olympic Special Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". The pair raised \u00a364,000 for charity with half of that sum going to the British Olympic Association and a quarter of the sum going to Asthma UK.\nHe was a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. He represented athletes in the organisation of the 2012 Summer Olympics. He is President of the Wenlock Olympian Soceity.\nAwards.\nAn honorary doctorate was conferred upon him at a ceremony at the University of Exeter on 21 January 2006.\nLater in the same year, an honorary doctorate of the university (DUniv) was conferred upon him at the winter graduation ceremony of the University of Ulster (19 December 2006).\nPersonal life.\nEdwards lives with his wife Alison in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. He has two sons, Nathan and Sam.\nReligious beliefs.\nHe initially refused to compete on Sundays due to his devout Christian beliefs. This decision cost him a chance to compete in the 1991 World Championships. However, in 1993, after much thinking and discussion with his father (a vicar), he changed his mind. He decided that God gave him his talent in order for him to compete in athletics.\nOn 2 February 2007 it was widely reported that Edwards had lost his faith in God despite him once saying \"My relationship with Jesus and God is fundamental to everything I do. I have made a commitment and dedication in that relationship to serve God in every area of my life.\"\nThe \"Daily Mail\" described Edwards as a \"man deeply troubled by the collapse of his Christian faith\". It also revealed that a friend said \"[Edwards] has a deep, theological comprehension of the Bible, making his spiritual meltdown even more unlikely ... They still go to church as a family\" The \"Daily Mail\" article also quoted Edwards as saying that he is going through a difficult period in his life. A period that is deeply personal to him and his family such that he does not wish to comment on.\nEdwards presented episodes of the Christian praise show Songs of Praise until 2007.\nIn an interview in \"The Times\" on 27 June 2007, Edwards said: \"If there is no God, does that mean that life has no purpose? Does it mean that personal existence ends at death? They are thoughts that do my head in. One thing that I can say, however, is that even if I am unable to discover some fundamental purpose to life, this will not give me a reason to return to Christianity.

It was next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity. The work was designed by Thomas Heatherwick. It was taken apart in 2009 due to structural problems.\nCommissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games, it was one of the tallest structures in the City of Manchester. It was the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of \"Aspire\" in 2008. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie. In the quotation he said that he started his races not at the \"bang\" of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'.\nThe sculpture was commissioned in 2003. Construction went longer than planned and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems. The tip of one of the spikes came off and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling \u00a31.7m.\nIn February 2009 Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be taken apart and placed in storage, as the \"only practical alternative\". The council said it was committed to working closely with the design team in order to \"determine whether there is a robust and affordable strategy for the re-construction of the structure on the site\". Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal.\nDesign and statistics.\n\"B of the Bang\" originally stood tall. It had 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes coming out of a central core. It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five long, tapered steel legs. These connected to the spikes above the ground. The sculpture weighed 165\u00a0tonnes. The concrete in the foundations weighed over 1,000\u00a0tonnes, including a reinforced concrete slab. The foundations are deep.\nThe sculpture was made from the same weathering steel (also known as Cor-Ten) as the Angel of the North sculpture. This slowly develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements. This layer prevents further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water. As part of the design, the spikes moved slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts over . At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture. It contained children's poems and paintings, due to be opened around 2300. The location of the time capsule after being taken apart is currently unknown.\n\"B of the Bang\" was next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity, in Beswick, at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road; coordinates . It took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the 'bang' of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'. The artwork had been nicknamed \"KerPlunk\" by the locals after the popular children's game from the 1970s.\nPrior to the construction of Aspire at the University of Nottingham, \"B of the Bang\" was Britain's tallest sculpture. It stood at twice the height of the Angel of the North. Angel of the North is tall. It was designed to look like an exploding firework. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002. The sculpture was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.\nConstruction and funding.\nThe sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio, Packman Lucas, Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures. It was approved at the start of 2003, with the central core arriving in Manchester on the 13 June 2004. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August 2004, after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname \"G of the Bang\".\nThe official unveiling by Linford Christie took place on 12 January 2005.\nIn total the sculpture cost \u00a31.42 million to design and construct \u2014 twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of \u00a3700,000, the North West Development Agency, contributing \u00a3500,000, and Manchester City Council providing \u00a3120,000.\nStructural problems and legal action.\nThe tip of one of the spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on the 6 January 2005, only six days before the official unveiling. After inspection, the event went ahead as planned.\nFour months later, in May 2005, a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 170 of the spikes.\nDespite these modifications, \"B of the Bang\" remained fenced off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to 'Get It Sorted'. In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel.\nIt was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008 this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council \u00a31.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence.\nDismantling.\nActing on a report in January 2009, the city council recommended that \"B of the Bang\" should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.\nIn January 2009, Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North\u00a0\u2014 to which \"B of the Bang\" is often compared\u00a0\u2014 spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, \"It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground-breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council's nerve.\" \nDespite Gormley's plea, removal of \"B of the Bang\" began in April 2009. More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm Connell Bros Ltd. began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment.\nAlthough the council had earlier promised to store the complex central core and legs, these too were cut apart during removal, casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture's return."}

In 1842 his father brought home a \"great piece of news\". Young John Lubbock thought it might be a new pony, and was disappointed that the news was that Charles Darwin was moving to Down House in the village. He was soon a frequent visitor to Down House, and became the closest of Darwin's younger friends.\nLubbock was educated at Eton College from 1845 and afterwards was taken into his father's bank, where he became a partner at the age of twenty-two. In 1865 he succeeded to the baronetcy.\nIn 1870, 1874, and 1880 he was elected to Parliament, where he promoted a number of laws. Lubbock was elected the first president of the Institute of Bankers in 1879; in 1881 he was president of the British Association, and from 1881 to 1886 president of the Linnean Society of London. In March 1883 he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage, which in 1986 became the Bankers Benevolent Fund \u2013 a charity for bank employees, past and present and their dependants. In January 1884 he founded the Proportional Representation Society, later to become the Electoral Reform Society.\nLubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Dublin and W\u00fcrzburg; and in 1878 was appointed a trustee of the British Museum. From 1888 to 1892 he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce; from 1889 to 1890 vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County Council.\nIn February 1890 he was appointed a Privy Councillor, and was chairman of the committee of design on the new coinage in 1891. In January 1900 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Avebury, his title commemorating the largest Neolithic site in Europe.\nLubbock in biology and archaeology.\nIn 1865 Lubbock published what was possibly the most influential archaeological text book of the 19th Century, \"Pre-historic times, as illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of modern savages\". He invented the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic to denote the Old and New Stone Ages respectively, but more notable was his introduction of a Darwinian view of human nature. \nLubbock was also an amateur biologist of some distinction, writing books on hymenoptera, on insect sense organs and development, on the intelligence of animals, and on other natural history topics. As a politician, one of his successes was in the passing of the Importation of Plumage Prohibition Act 1908. He was a member of the famous X Club founded by T.H. Huxley to promote the growth of science in Britain. He discovered that ants were sensitive to the ultraviolet range of the spectrum. The Punch verse of 1882 captured him perfectly:\nHe carried out extensive correspondence with Charles Darwin, who lived nearby in Downe. In addition to their shared interest in natural history, both men were active advocates of spelling reform, and members of the Spelling Reform Association. When Darwin died in 1882, Lubbock suggested the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, and was one of the pallbearers."}

This makes NP-complete decision problems the hardest problems in NP (they are NP-hard).

A military team under the command of the U.S. Air Force Colonel Jonathan Jack O'Neil goes through the stargate with Jackson, and after the journey find out that they cannot get back to Earth. They find a city of ancient Egyptian-like people under the tyrannical rule of Ra, who is an alien posing as their god. They eventually kill Ra with a nuclear blast and figure out how to get back to Earth, but Jackson gets married and stays on the planet."}

They are tiny worm-like marine animals. They live in sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments. \nAnatomy.\nMost gnathostomulids measure 0.5 to 1 millimetre (0.02 to 0.04 in) in length. They are slender to thread-like worms, with a transparent body. The neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head. \nLike flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis, but are unique in having but one cilium per cell. The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also have muscles that allow the body to twist or contract. \nThey have no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is very simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region.\nThe mouth is just behind the head, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of muscular jaws supplied with minute teeth, and a plate on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure which they use to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat. The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes places; there is no anus. \nTaxonomy.\nThere are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed. Gnathostomulids have no fossil record.\nReproduction.\nGnathostomulids are simultaneous hermaphrodites. Each individual possesses a single ovary and one or two testes. After fertilisation, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage."}

These dates are when a storm is likely to start in 2010. The first storm of this season formed about two weeks before the first storm of 2009 did. So far, there have been five tropical depression, four of those five became a tropical storm, while only one because a hurricane. In addition, one storm, Hurricane Celia, was the second earliest category 5 hurricane on record\nThe first storm, Tropical Storm Agatha killed at least 196 people in Central America. No other storms in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season have affected land yet.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Agatha.\nThe first storm of the season started from a tropical disturbance, which is similar to a tropical wave. This tropical disturbance grew into Tropical Depression One-E on May 29. Tropical Depression One quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and it was given the name \"Agatha\". Moving toward land, Tropical Storm Agatha peak as a weak tropical storm with winds of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h). Tropical Storm Agatha had made landfall near the Mexico and Guatemala border. Agatha had quickly died over land on May 30 after moving northward.\nTropical Storm Agatha killed about 146 people in Central America.\nTropical Depression Two-E.\nTropical Depression Two-E started on June 16 from a tropical wave. Moving just south of the Mexican coast, winds top at 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h), which was too low for a storm to be a tropical storm. Remaining off the coast, Tropical Depression Two-E dissipated on June 17 without becoming a tropical storm.\nRains from Tropical Depression Two-E caused flooding, which damage about 82 houses and affected 40 other houses near the coast. In addition, some people lost there roofs because of high winds. No people were killed by Tropical Depression Two-E.\nTropical Storm Blas.\nOn June 17, Tropical Depression Four-E started from an area of low pressure. Tropical Depression Four-E strengthened fast, and had become Tropical Storm Blas just one hour later. Blas became a strong tropical storm and had its highest winds at 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) on June 19. It began to weakened slowly as it headed into colder waters. The next day, Blas weakened to a tropical depression and died the following day, June 21. Tropical Storm Blas remained far enough from land to cause no affects. \nHurricane Celia.\nCelia formed from an area of low pressure on June 19, and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. On June 21 Celia became a Category 2 hurricane and on June 23 strengthened further to become a Category 3 for a little while before weakening again due to bad conditions. After these bad conditions disappeared, Celia strengthened again and became a Category 5 hurricane on June 24, and the strongest storm of the season so far. However Celia moved into a part of the ocean with dry air above it and Celia weakened to a tropical storm quickly, before dying out completely. Celia was far enough away from land to not cause any damage.\nStorm names.\nThe following names will be used for named storms that form in East Pacific in 2010. Names that were not used are marked in , and names in bold are storms currently active. This list is the same as it was in the 2004 season.\nFor the central Pacific Ocean, four names are used.

San Marcos and the colleges of San Carlos and San Fernando (after incorporated to the university) were monitored by the Viceroy.\nDuring the emancipation times, the university was a very important figure for the independence movements. The first Constituent congress of Peru took place in the chapel of the University of San Marcos in 1822. During the 19th century the university returned to its local known as the \"Casona\", next to the university park.

People with OCPD are with rules and order, and can feel worried or angry when things do not seem right. This can lead to routines and rules for ways of doing things, for themselves and the people around them.\nSigns of OCPD.\nPeople with OCPD pay an unusual amount of attention to details, rules, lists, order, organization, and schedules. It is very hard to get them to change their minds. They are perfectionist and want themselves to always be working and doing it right. Because of this, they are afraid to let other people do things in case they do it wrong.\nSome people with OCPD, but not all of them, have a strong need to be clean. Those that do not show this tendency are sometimes good at setting up systems to keep clean, but may not follow through with the need to clean because of other \"more important\" things. For example, the need to finish a project at work might cause the OCPD person to have a quite unorganized home. But if that same person was suddenly unemployed or finished with other things, they could very well start becoming more concerned about being clean as they have more free time.\nOCPD people sometimes do not finish things on time because too much time is used in getting it to be just right. Friends and family are often under serious strain because the OCPD individual must be in charge and the only one who knows what is right. Not being clean or tidy enough is seen by some OCPD individuals as not being perfect enough. They may regularly spend a lot of time putting things in exactly the right place in exactly the right way. OCPD sufferers can be worried about things going wrong in their lives, and hoard money just in case.\nFor a person with fully developed OCPD, actions and beliefs are either completely right or completely wrong, and they are always right. Because of this, interpersonal relationships are difficult as the person demands too much of their friends, partners, and children. When people do not do what they want, sometimes people with OCPD turn to anger and even violence. They often suffer from depression. This can sometimes be so serious that they might commit suicide. One study suggests that disorders like OCPD can make people more depressed than actually having major depressive disorder.\nPeople with OCPD, when anxious or excited, may have tics, pull faces, or make noises like people with Tourette syndrome, or do and surprising things."}

{"id": "245294", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245294", "title": "Red Dead Redemption", "text": "Red Dead Redemption is an action-adventure western video game made by Rockstar San Diego. It was released in May 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is a spiritual successor to 2004's \"Red Dead Revolver\".\nGameplay.\n\"Red Dead Redemption\" gives the player a big and open world environment. This allows the player to move freely. Players on foot can walk, talk, shoot, kill, ride, run, interact with the environment. Players may also fight enemies with firearms. Different breeds of horses is how the player mainly gets around. Players cannot go swimming, because the main character John Marston cannot swim and will drown if the player goes too far into the water (though he is able to go where the water is shallow).\nThe open world environment allows players to choose how they want to play. Storyline missions are for progress. Players can also take part in many events they come across as they explore the world. Some examples are public hangings, ambushes, cries for help, and animal attacks. Players can also take part in optional side activities ranging from standoffs, five fingers fillet game, gambling, and hunting animals for pelts and meat.\n\"Red Dead Redemption\" makes use of an honesty system. This is when players have the chance to get good or bad 'honor'. Some of the ways to get good honor are like taking an outlaw alive instead of killing him, or saving a kidnapped person. Bad honor can be gotten for doing crimes like killing and/or robbing people. This works along with another system, 'fame,' showing and governing how people react based on Marston's honor status.\nMaking and marketing.\nA trailer of the game was sent to a select number of people at a Sony meeting in 2005. It helped the release of the PlayStation 3 system. The trailer was a tech demo of Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. It was set in a western setting thought to as \"Old West Project\" and a sequel to \"Red Dead Revolver\". The trailer flowed throughout the internet. In the April edition of \"Game Informer\", \"Red Dead Redemption\" was listed as being for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.\nOn February 3, 2009, Rockstar Games showed the first official trailer. Resulting trailers had many characters, gameplay features, and multiplayer modes that will be shown in the final release. The game was shown on NASCAR driver Joey Logano's number 20 Toyota Camry in the Nationwide Series running of the O'Reilly 300. This took place at the Texas Motor Speedway on April 17, 2010. In North America, television network Fox plans to show a half-hour in-game special. It will be directed by John Hillcoat on May 29, 2010.\nIn North America, GameStop and Rockstar worked with each other on a pre-order bonus. This bonus would let customers vote for one of three outfits that Marston could unlock in the game. Each outfit came with a different bonus. For example, the \"Deadly Assassin\" outfit allows Marston to restart slow-mo \"Dead-Eye\" targeting twice as fast. The \"Savvy Merchant\" outfit would cut in half the purchasing price of ammunition and guns and double the selling price for ammunition and guns. And the \"Expert Hunter\" outfit would double the amount of money the player could get from selling hides of animals. Voting was open to all, but only those who pre-ordered the game through Gamestop will get the winning outfit, the \"Deadly Assassin\".\nAlong with the GameStop pre-order special, there are many other pre-order bonuses through other game stores. These game stores are throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. These are the \"War Horse\" and the \"Golden Guns\". The \"War Horse\" is a black horse with a white mane, tail and markings thought as \"rare\" as well as being \"faster\" and having \"more health\" than any other horse in the game. The \"Golden Guns\" reward increases fame with each kill. This allows users to progress much faster up the ladder of fame. The official online Rockstar Games store, the \"Rockstar Warehouse,\" offers a \"Red Dead Redemption\" T-shirt as the pre-order bonus. With some countries getting the \"Golden Guns\" and the \"War Horse,\" all will have the Deadly Assassin outfit along with the first soundtrack.\nLimited additional showings such as a new gang hideout and a walton gang outfit, is available for the PlayStation 3 version of the game. Plus, some awards in the game unlock rewards for PlayStation Home, PlayStation 3's online social gaming network.\nSoundtrack.\n\"Red Dead Redemption Original Soundtrack\" is the soundtrack of video game music from the game \"Red Dead Redemption\". The music was mostly made by Friends of Dean Martinez member Bill Elm and ex-member Woody Jackson along with some other people from many musicians like Swedish folk musician Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez.\nReception.\nThe game got a lot of praise when it was released. It also got a lot of good reviews from the views of the open world, story, and soundtrack. The game has gotten a 95/100 on both Metacritic and GameRankings. On Metacritic, it is the 5th best rated Xbox 360 game of all time and the 3rd best rated PlayStation 3 game of all time. On GameRankings both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game are on the \"All-Time Best\" video game list.\n\"The New York Times\" game review reporter said, \"\"In the more than 1,100 articles I have written for this newspaper since 1996, I have never before called anything a tour de force. Yet there is no more succinct and appropriate way to describe \"Red Dead Redemption\".\"\nIGN gave good reviews on the game giving it a 9.7/10. They said, \"\"What is most impressive about this sandbox is how fun it is to simply hop on a horse and take off across the prairie\".\" In the end they said \"\"Red Dead Redemption is a must-play game. Rockstar has taken the Western to new heights and created one of the deepest, most fun, and most gorgeous games around. You can expect the occasional bug or visual hiccup, but you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for\".\" GameSpot awarded the game 9.5/10 and said that it \"raises the bar for open world action games\".\nhttp://www.change.org/petitions/rockstar-games-port-red-dead-redemption-on-pc\nGameSpy gave it 5/5 stars saying \"\"With Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar succeeds in creating one of the most impressive open worlds I've ever seen in a game, and it's telling that \u2014 even after playing for over 30 hours \u2014 all I want to do is get back on my horse and gallop back into the wilderness\".\" VideoGamer gave it a 10/10 saying \"\"The game itself is absolutely spectacular... The sheer quality of Red Dead Redemption is evident right from the word go.\" They also said \"it's a magnificent piece of work that everybody should play\".\"\nEurogamer gave Red Dead Redemption an 8/10, saying \"successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario\"."}

Hypertrophy happens because the cells grow bigger. The condition where an organ is bigger, because there are more cells is called hyperplasia. \nSome cells like adipocytes (fat cells) get larger by expanding outward while filling up with more lipid contents, while myocytes (muscle cells) can fuse with other myocytes to form huge myotube cells. Organs or tissues can grow larger due to the enlargement of their component cells. One of the most common and visible forms of normal, organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training or bodybuilding.\nIn contrast, tissues and organs can also get larger by another mechanism, hyperplasia, in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number. Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together. The hormonally-induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy is an example of this combination under normal conditions. In some tumors, enlargement can occur by an increase in the number of cells together with the occurrence of some abnormally large cells."}
{"id": "245306", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245306", "title": "Spiritual successor", "text": "A Spiritual successor, sometimes called a Spiritual sequel or a Companion piece, is a sequel to a work of fiction which does not have the same storyline made in the first. Spiritual successors still have the same elements, themes, and styles as the first.\nReasons for making a spiritual successor.\nThe nature of the publisher/maker system are basic in almost all computer games. As well as the purchase and takeovers by many companies. These are reasons why creative teams often lose to keep the copyright and trademark rights of what they made. This often makes attempts to make sequels for a product not possible for many reasons. One of the reasons it the \"core\" of the studio being fired or taken over after finishing a project while the parent company keeps control of the copyrights and trademarks. A good example of this strategy is Electronic Arts. They have closed many studios while keeping their copyrights and trademarks, such as Bullfrog Productions, Origin Systems, and Westwood Studios.\nTo get around this, creative teams will make a product that is kind of like the first game in some way, without copying the first directly. For example, the video games \"TimeSplitters\" and, \"Perfect Dark\" are often thought to be the spiritual successors to the hit video game \"GoldenEye 007\".\nOther times, a spiritual successor is made when the first products were either poor commercial sellers and/or forgotten by the people that would purchase the product. By leaving the first product's name and maybe its baggage as a forgotten product, the spiritual sequel can be loved by fresh eyes. An example of this would be \"BioShock\", which has been named to by its makers as the spiritual successor to \"System Shock 2\". \"System Shock\" and \"System Shock 2\" both got good reviews, but both failed to get the expected commercial success. Unlike \"BioShock\", which was both a reviewer and commercial success."}

He writes science fiction books. He is one of the most important people in the part of science fiction called cyberpunk. His most famous book is \"Neuromancer\".\nEarly life.\nChildhood, moving around, and adolescence.\nWilliam Ford Gibson was born in Conway, South Carolina on the Atlantic coast. He spent most of his childhood in Wytheville, Virginia. Whytheville is a small town in the Appalachians. His parents had been born and raised there.\nGibson was shy and awkward as a teenager. He grew up in a place and time where most people thought and acted alike. This was a problem for him. He chose not to believe in religion. He read science fiction and writers such as William S. Burroughs and Henry Miller. Gibson was not doing well in school and his mother was frustrated. She threatened to send him to a boarding school. She was very surprised when he liked this idea very much.\nAvoiding the military, leaving home, and counterculture.\nGibson's mother died when he was eighteen years old. He left school and did not graduate. He traveled a lot. He became very interested in the counterculture. He left the United States and moved to Canada during the Vietnam War draft.\nAfter graduation, early writing, and the beginning of cyberpunk.\nGibson finished a graduate degree about science fiction. He stopped writing for one year. He did not like the trends he saw in SF. He was more interested in punk rock. He met other writers such as Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, and Rudy Rucker. These writers became the important members of the cyberpunk movement in SF.\nLiterary career.\nEarly short fiction.\nGibson's first published short story was \"Fragments of a Hologram Rose\" (1977). He wrote other short stories for magazines such as Omni. He was often compared to J. G. Ballard. Some of the characters and places in his short stories are also in his Sprawl novels.\nNeuromancer.\nTerry Carr asked Gibson to write \"Neuromancer\" for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials. The purpose of the series was to give attention to first-time novelists.\nThe Sprawl trilogy, The Difference Engine, and the Bridge trilogy.\n\"Neuromancer\" was a success and Gibson kept writing SF. \"The Sprawl trilogy\" continued the story of Neuromancer, even though Gibson did not plan to write any sequels. Then he explored other ideas. \"The Difference Engine\" was alternate history. In \"The Bridge trilogy\", Gibson wrote about new problems. He paid less attention to large corporations or artificial intelligence. He wrote more about mass media and celebrity.\nBlue Ant.\nGibson's novels \"Pattern Recognition\" (2003), \"Spook Country\" (2007) and \"Zero History\" (2010) happen in the same contemporary universe \u2014 \"more or less the same one we live in now\" \nOther kinds of writing.\nWorking with other writers.\nHe has written short stories and novels with others, especially other cyberpunk authors John Shirley and Bruce Sterling.\nFilm.\nThere have been many attempts to make films based on Gibson's writing. Most of these have never been completed.\nShows, poetry, music, and performance art.\nGibson has written poems too. He has also worked with artists, architects, and musicians.\nIn 1990, Gibson was part of an exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art called \"Visionary San Francisco\". He wrote a short story, \"Skinner's Room\", that took place in San Francisco. In the story, the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and became a community for homeless people. Architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts were interested in the story and imagined a future San Francisco. Their idea of the future showed rich people living in high-tech towers above a city that was falling apart. Gibson was part of the architects' exhibit. Visitors could watch a video of him discussing the future and reading from the story \"Skinner's Room\".

The capital city is Hanga Roa.\nIt is famous for its 887 huge statues called Moai, made by the early Rapa Nui people. Easter Island also has a huge crater called Rano Kau at the edge of the island. In the crater there is a natural lake, one of only three bodies of fresh water on the island.\nEaster Island a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Much of the island is protected in the Rapa Nui National Park.\nThe introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and slave raiding devastated the population in the 1800s. Introduced animals, first rats and then sheep, were largely responsible for the island's loss of native flora.\nHistory.\nThe history of Easter Island is rich and controversial. Its inhabitants have suffered famines, civil war, slave raids, and near total loss of forests. The population has declined steeply more than once. The islanders have left a cultural legacy that is famous.\n300\u2013400 AD was thought to be the date of the first settlement of Easter Island, which is about the same time as the arrival of the first settlers on Hawaii. However, new results in radiocarbon dating show that Polynesia and Rapa Nui were settled between 700 to 1,100 AD.\nThe island was most probably settled by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Marquesas Islands, 3,200\u00a0km (2,000 miles) away, or the Gambier Islands (Mangareva, 2,600\u00a0km (1,600 miles) away. When Captain Cook visited the island, one of his crew members, who was a Polynesian from Bora Bora, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui.\nAccording to oral traditions written down by missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had a very clear class system, with an ariki, high chief, who had great power over nine other clans and their chiefs.\nA French navigator, Jean-Francois de Galaup, comte de La Perouse, found 2,000 people on the island when he arrived in 1786. A major slave raid from Peru in 1862, followed by epidemics of smallpox, reduced the population to only 111 people by 1877. By that time, Catholic missionaries had settled on Easter Island and begun to convert the population to Christianity, a process that was completed by the late 19th century. In 1888, Chile annexed Easter Island, leasing much of the land for sheep raising. The Chilean government appointed a civilian governor for Easter Island in 1965, and the island\u2019s residents became full Chilean citizens.\nThe high chief was the eldest descendent, through firstborn lines, of the island's legendary founder, Hotu Matu'a. The most visible part of the culture was the making of very large statues called moai that represented deified ancestors. It was believed that the living had a relationship with the dead where the dead provided everything the living needed. Most settlements were on the coast and moai were erected all along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea.\nCulture.\nThe most important myths are:\nClimate and weather.\nThe climate of Easter Island is subtropical maritime. The lowest temperatures are in July and August (18\u00a0\u00b0C) and the highest in February (maximum temperature 28\u00a0\u00b0C), the summer season in the southern hemisphere.

It is situated about 16\u00a0kilometres south of Campbelltown and 35\u00a0kilometres north west of Wollongong. In 2006, there were 1,423 people living in Appin. The fifth village settled in Australia, it is now on the fringe of the Sydney urban area.\nThe town was named by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1811 after a small village on the coast of Scotland where his wife was born. One of the first settlers was John Hume, whose son Hamilton Hume became a famous Australian explorer. Hamilton Hume explored the local area and was given a grant of 300 acres of land at Appin as a reward. When he made his famous journey to Victoria with William Hovell in 1824, they started the journey from Appin.\nAppin is the birthplace of John Fuller (1830-1865), the Australian bushranger also known as Dan Morgan.\nCataract Gorge is about 10 km south east of Appin. It is now has a dam built in 1906 which is the oldest dam in the Sydney water supply system. On 17 April 1816, the British army killed many Aboriginal men, women and children, of the Dharawal Nation at the gorge. They had been fighting the European settlers who were moving into the area.\nThe Roman Catholic church at Appin, St. Bede's, was built from 1837-1843. The design was by Father John Therry (1790-1864), who became Australia's first Catholic priest in 1820. St. Bede's is the oldest Catholic church still in continuous use. It was named after St. Bede, the founder of the Benedictines."}

The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries.\nHistorically, the word \"constable\" comes from the Latin, \"comes stabuli\", count of the stables. It came from the Eastern Roman Empire. Originally, the constable was the person who kept the horses of a lord or monarch. The title was later used in the monarchies of medieval Europe. In many countries, the constable became a high military rank and great officer of State such as, the Constable of France.\nIn modern times, constables are law enforcement officers. In the United Kingdom, Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries, a constable is the lowest rank of police officer. In the United States a constable is usually an elected peace officer, with less powers than a sheriff. However, in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office-holder at the parish level.\nHistorically, a constable could also be someone in charge of the defence of a castle. Even today, there is a Constable of the Tower of London.\nIt is a similar position to Marshal, which comes from Old High German \"marah\" \"horse\" and \"schalh\" \"servant\", and originally meant \"stable keeper\", which has a similar etymology."}

It also includes a small area of Victoria near Snowy River National Park. The Australian Capital Territory is often considered part of the region. Most towns in the region have very close links with Canberra.\nThe Monaro region is a large plateau about above sea level. It lies between the valley of the Murrumbidgee River in the north, and the Errinundra Plateau in the south. It drops steeply to the coast on its eastern side. Much of the region is an ancient highland, but there is basaltic bedrock near Cooma and Nimmitabel. This produces the only true chernozems in Australia. These are some of the best soils in the whole country. Elsewhere on the Monaro the granitic soils are very infertile. They supported dry forest vegetation before clearing for farming.\nBecause it is located east of the Snowy Mountains, the rain-bearing westerly winds drop rain and snow on the mountains leaving the Monaro region in a rain shadow. Annual rainfall ranges from around Dalgety to at the eastern edge of the plateau. Occasional storms can produce very heavy rainfall. On one day in June 1975, Nimmitabel received of rain. Temperatures in summer are warm to very warm. The average maximum temperatures range from around Canberra and Queanbeyan to on the highest parts of the plateau. Nights in summer can be cool, but in winter the region is the coldest part of mainland Australia outside the Alps The with July minimum temperatures averaging in Canberra and in Bombala.\nThe Monaro region features rolling hills that rise to very rugged peaks in the Tinderry Mountains. There are shallow valleys in the upper Murrumbidgee. The basaltic Monaro Range separates the Snowy and Murrumbidgee drainages. Because the climate in the basaltic areas is too cold for crops, the main industry is raising sheep and beef cattle.\nThe Monaro Highway is the main State highway from Canberra to the Monaro region. The main towns in the region are Cooma and Bombala, others include Berridale, Adaminaby, Delegate, Dalgety, Nimmitabel and Jindabyne."}

It was a building society, but 'demutualised' and became a bank. Halifax then merged with the Bank of Scotland and made up HBOS. In 2009, HBOS merged with Lloyds TSB and made Lloyds Banking Group. Until 2010 Halifax was also an estate agent.\nHistory.\nThe Halifax started in 1853 as the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society at the Old Cock Inn in Halifax, West Yorkshire. The building society was created to allow working-class people in Halifax to invest their money in a local and 'mutual' organisation.\nIn 1928 it merged with the Halifax Equitable Building Society and changed its name to the Halifax Building Society. In 1973 the Halifax built its headquarters on Trinity Road in Halifax. By the 1990s the Halifax was the largest building society in Britain, now Halifax is a bank the largest is the Nationwide.\nIn 1995 the Halifax merged with the Leeds Permanent Building Society, this new larger building society then bought out Clerical Medical Find Managers.\nIn 1997 the Halifax became a bank and registered with the London Stock Exchange.\nBy 1997 the Halifax was the fifth largest bank in the United Kingdom and had joined the 'big four' to make it a 'big five'.\nThe Halifax continued to grow and in 1999 the Halifax bought out the Birmingham Midshires Building Society and Comparetheloan. In 1999 the Halifax set up Intelligent Finance', which was a telephone based bank.\nIn 2001 the Halifax merged with the Bank of Scotland and former Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS). Both brands were kept although some Halifax branches in Scotland became 'Bank of Scotland' and Bank of Scotland branches in Ireland became 'Halifax' branches. This was done because the Bank of Scotland was much larger in Scotland than the Halifax, while Halifax was much larger in Ireland than the Bank of Scotland and had spent a lot of money advertising of Irish television.\nIn January 2009 HBOS was acquired by Lloyds TSB which subsequently became Lloyds Banking Group. The Halifax is now just a brand name used by this group.\nOffices.\nThe bank has its main offices in Halifax town centre. It also has other major offices in Copley (near Halifax) and Leeds The Leeds offices used to belong to the Leeds Permanent Building Society. There are also offices in Aylesbury, Nottingham and Buckinghamshire.\nNow the Halifax is part of Lloyds Banking Group there are also many former Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and TSB offices. Some services have been centralised, leading to job losses at some offices.\nIt was announced on June 30th 2010 that the Nottingham office is to close at the end of 2011. It has been confirmed by banking officials from Lloyds that a total of 198 jobs will be lost as a result.\nBranches.\nThe Halifax has branches all over the United Kingdom and also has 44 in Ireland (although these are to close). Many Halifax branches used to belong to the Leeds Permanent Building Society, which was taken-over by the Halifax in 1995."}

It opened in September 1994 and is the United Kingdom's leading indoor Olympic-standard track. Today it is home to the National Cycling Centre, and the headquarters of British Cycling, the national governing body. It is open to the public.\nIt hosted the track cycling in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and the UCI world championships in 1996, 2000 and 2008.\nThe track has a reputation for speed. By 30 March 2008, more than 15 world records had been set there. The records include Chris Boardman's 1996 and 2000 hour records and the 4000\u00a0metre team pursuit record set by the Great Britain men's team at the 2008 World Championships.\nThe track is 250\u00a0metres long. Its bankings reach 42\u00a0degrees in the middle. The track is as steep at the top as it is on the black (racing) line. On 21 May 2007 the velodrome closed to be re-surfaced. The old track was relaid with Siberian pine. It reopened on 16 July 2007, and is now considered smoother to ride.\nRevolution Series.\nThe Revolution Series was introduced in 2003 to make track cycling more popular. Its goal was to try and build on the success of the well attended events like the World Championships and World Cup Classics Meetings. It was also to provide more regular events for fans to go to. The series started with 4 events over the winter season and quickly built up good regular crowds. The first close to sell out crowd came at the 7th meeting, in 2005, when all seats were sold with a further number of fans standing. The first official complete sell out came at Revolution 14 and is now a regular occurrence.\nAlongside the senior racing, the Future Stars competition also runs at each Revolution event. This series involves young riders, usually 15-16 year olds, and puts them through a number of races each night to test both their sprint and endurance skills.\nHosted events.\nAn incomplete list of events which Manchester Velodrome has hosted:\nCycling For All.\nThe velodrome is not just solely for the use of professional riders. Cycling fans can also have the opportunity of riding around the famous boards as well. Regular sessions are run every week at the velodrome, starting from taster sessions right up to serious training. A taster session involves some basic training and an hour riding the track.\nOther events.\nOn 2 July 2009 cycling fans Kraftwerk performed at the Manchester Velodrome as part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival. During the performance of the song Tour de France, four members of the British Olympic Cycling Team entered the velodrome and cycled circuits."}

Barack Obama, the incumbent president and Democratic candidate, won the election. He defeated Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, who was the former Governor of Massachusetts. There were also elections for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. \nBy November 6, 2012, 11:30 PM ET (5:30 AM UTC), many broadcast networks said that Obama and Biden won the election. Mitt Romney of the Republican Party conceded the election to Obama around 1 AM ET on November 7. Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party came in third.\nElectoral College changes.\nBetween the 2008 and 2012 elections the Electoral College changed because of the 2010 Census. As a result, several states have lost electoral votes, and several states have gained electoral votes. Here are the states that have gained or lost electoral votes:\nGained votes\nLost votes\nConventions.\nThe Republicans held their national convention from August 27 to August 30, 2012 at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida. The Democrats held their convention from September 3 to September 6, 2012 at the Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nMajor candidates.\nDemocrats.\nBarack Obama declared that he was running for re-election in 2012 on April 4, 2011. He had challengers in 7 states, but still managed to win all 57 democratic primaries and therefore the democratic nomination.\nRepublicans.\nWithdrawn.\nIn the middle of 2011, there were many Republicans running: Minnesota congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Businessman Herman Cain, Speaker of the House of Representatives (in the 1990s) Newt Gingrich, Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Ambassador to China and Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman, Texas Governor Rick Perry, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, Buddy Roemer, Thaddeus McCotter, and Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty.\nScott Brown, Sarah Palin, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, and Rudy Giuliani were considered possible candidates. All of them said that they were not going to run for president.\nIn May, a series of debates began between the Republicans. \nIn August 2011, the Ames Straw Poll was conducted. It was won by Bachmann, with Paul coming in second. During the poll, Perry entered the race. After not placing in the top 2 in the poll, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty dropped out. Thaddeus McCotter dropped out a short time later.\nRick Perry became the frontrunner (person with the highest amount of support who is expected to win, according to polls) of the party, ahead of Romney in the polls. Rick Perry then had several bad debates and in one of them, he said he wanted to remove 3 government departments, but forgot one of them. After these mistakes, Perry's poll numbers went down.\nIn the fall, Herman Cain became the new frontrunner for several months. He had an economic plan called 9-9-9 that would replace the entire tax system with a 9% income tax, a 9% national sales tax, and a 9% corporation tax. During foreign policy debates, he was not as successful. On December 3, 2011, Cain left the Presidential race. This was after several women said that he had sexually harassed them.\nNewt Gingrich and Mitt Romney were the two main competitors after that, but soon after Newt Gingrich lost much of his support. Gary Johnson withdrew on December 28, 2011, to run for the nomination of the Libertarian Party.\nIn January 2012, after not doing well in the primaries, Bachmann, Huntsman, and Perry dropped out of the Presidential race. Rick Santorum, however, picked up a surprise win in Iowa, as did Gingrich in South Carolina.\nFor February, March, and the beginning of April, Rick Santorum was Mitt Romney's main competitor. On April 10, However, with only 11 (primary) victories to Romney's 23, Rick Santorum announced that he was going to drop out of the race. Buddy Roemer dropped out on February 22nd to run for the nominations of americans elect and the reform party, before ending his campaign completely on May 31.\nAfter Santorum dropped out, most people thought that Mitt Romney would win the most primaries, and therefore the most pledged delegates, and ultimately the nomination. His two remaining opponents, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul decided to stay in the race. Gingrich dropped out on May 2 after a disappointing showing in the Delaware primary that left his number of victories at 2 to Romney's 28. Paul, despite having only 1 victory to Romney's eventual 42 victories, did not end his campaign until after the 2012 republican national convention.\nSantorum and Gingrich released their delegates ahead of the convention to vote for Romney.\nAt the republican national convention, with support from many pledged and unpledged delegates, Romney won the nomination in a landslide. The convention chose Paul Ryan as Romney's running mate.\nOthers.\nOther candidates for nomination included Virgil Goode, Roseanne Barr, Rocky Anderson, and Tom Hoefling.\nFour other parties nominated candidates that had ballot access or write-in access to at least 270 electoral votes, the minimum number of votes needed in the 2012 election to win the presidency through a majority of the electoral college.\nPolls.\nMany polls have been taken about the presidential election. Most polls show Obama beating Romney, aside from polls taken between the first and second presidential debates. In polls taken state-by-state, Obama usually wins states he won in 2008, and Republicans usually win states that McCain won in 2008. Indiana, North Carolina, and Nebraska's second congressional district are the main exceptions to the rule.\nResults by state.\nPopular vote count is preliminary, and does not include all precincts.\nProjection by state.\nWhen you read \"Consensus\", it means that many news programs have said they believe Obama/Romney will win a particular state. A projection is when someone expresses their belief in something, in this case about the outcome of the election. An EV is an Electoral vote, from the Electoral college.\nNote: Florida was not called until November 10 due to an extremely close race."}

The aims are achieved through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, public and private organizations, communities and individuals. \nIt bases on health analysis of a handful of people or all the inhabitants of several continents rather than on an individual. Public health includes such parts as epidemiology, biostatistics, health services, environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health. \nPublic health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing, vaccination programs and distribution of condoms. In outbreaks of an infectious disease, treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others. \nMost countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations. In the developing world, there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. \nHistory of public health.\nPublic health has roots in antiquity. From the beginning, human civilization recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases. Early religions attempted to regulate behavior related to health, from types of food eaten, to behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or sexual relationships. Governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease, ensure social stability prosperity, and maintain order. \nThe Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s. During the 14th century Black Death in Europe, burning parts of cities resulted in benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations. The development of quarantine in the medieval period restricted effects of other infectious diseases. \nLater they started build of sewers, the regular collection of garbage, incineration or disposal, providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos. The industrial revolution initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories.\nModern public health.\nThe increase in average life span in the 20th century is credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases, effective safety policies of motor vehicle and occupational safety, improved family planning, chlorination of drinking water, smoke-free measures, and programs on decreasing chronic disease such as cancer, heart disease and more physical exercise.\nSometimes, the developing world is plagued by largely preventable infectious diseases, due to malnutrition and poverty. The focus of public health has moved from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. There is recognition that our health is affected by where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships.\nEducation and training.\nSchools of public health offer: \nPublic health programs.\nMost governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. In recent years, public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox. \nAn important public health issues facing the world currently are HIV/AIDS, antibiotic resistance, leading to the re-emergence of diseases such as Tuberculosis, diabetes. As non-communicable diseases caused by smoking have been threatening public health, public health started controlling smoking. The global health system needs to find a way to even out communicable and non communicable diseases. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places."}

{"id": "245908", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245908", "title": "Epidemiology", "text": "Epidemiology is the study of factors that influence the health and illness of populations. The three levels of causation of health problems include individual behavioral level, individual biological level, and political-economic ecological level. Epidemiologists aim to understand the causes of health problems by looking at the relationship between agents, hosts, and environmental factors that affects health. Using these information, they also design public health interventions to solve various health problems among populations. They regularly evaluate the health of populations, tries to identify which populations have greater risk from specific causes of diseases, and evaluates the effectiveness of the intervention programs or methods that they create. In essence, epidemiology provides the backbone or foundation of public health and preventative medicine practices.\nThere are two types of epidemiology: descriptive and analytic. Descriptive epidemiology aims to describe the distribution of people who gets sick (versus those who don't) with regards to time, place, and person (TPP). TPP can also be thought of as answering the questions of when, who, and what respectively; in other words it investigates when a health issue or disease first emerged in a population, who in the population are getting sick, and where the disease/health condition seems to have first originated and spread from. Analytic epidemiology then uses the data provided by TPP to make and test hypothesis which aim to determine the cause of an outbreak or disease cluster among a population. Epidemiologist evaluate morbidity (people who are sick or injured) and mortality (people who are killed) to understand the burden of disease among populations.\nA key aspect of epidemiology is surveillance studies, which provides the numerical data and statistics that epidemiologists use. Surveillance studies are done systematically to monitor the health of populations and helps with identifying any new health problems or disease that may develop, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of existing health intervention measures in place. These studies also rely on TPP to collect data and presents it in simple graphs and tables which are easy to summarize and understand. These studies are especially important in helping guide policy making decisions and helping epidemiologists understand which interventions work and which don't. It is also important for donors as they rely on surveillance data to analyze the usefulness of their investments and whether it is being used effectively or not.\nHistory.\nEpidemiology means \"the study of what is upon the people\". The word derived from the Greek terms \"epi\" = upon, among; \"demos\" = people, district; \"logos\" = study, word, discourse. It applies only to human populations. But the term is used in studies of zoological populations 'epizoology', and plant populations.\nHippocrates was the first who has looked at the relationships between disease and environmental influences. He drew the distinction between 'epidemic' and 'endemic': diseases that are 'visited upon' a population (epidemic) as contrasted with those that 'live within' a population (endemic).\nThe Persian physician Avicenna in the 1020s, discovered the contagious nature of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease. He noted the distribution of disease through water and soil. Avicenna said that bodily secretion is contaminated by foul foreign earthly bodies before being infected. He introduced the method of quarantine to limit the spread of contagious disease.\nThe Black Death (bubonic plague) reached Al Andalus in the 14th century. Ibn Khatima thought infectious diseases were caused by \"minute bodies\" which enter the human body and cause disease. Another Andalusian-Arabian physician, Ibn al-Khatib (1313\u20131374) in his treatise \"On the Plague\" stated how infectious disease can be transmitted through bodily contact and \"through garments, vessels and earrings\". Girolamo Fracastoro from Verona suggested these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were able to spread by air, and multiply. They could be destroyed by fire. He refuted Galen's miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543, Fracastoro's book \"De contagione et contagiosis morbis\" suggested personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.\nIn 1662 John Graunt analysed the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague. This gave statistical evidence for and against various theories of disease. Dr. John Snow investigated the causes of the 19th Century Cholera epidemics. He noticed the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Water Company. He showed the Broad Street pump was the origin of the Soho epidemic, a classic example of epidemiology He used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and had the pump handle removed. This stopped the outbreak. It was a major event in the history of public health, and the founding event of the science of epidemiology.\nThe term 'epidemiology' was first used in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba. The term is used now for the description and causation of epidemic diseases, and of disease in general. It can be used for many non-disease health-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and obesity.\nIn 1847 Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by disinfection. Unfortunately, disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister 'discovered' antiseptics in 1865 after Louis Pasteur's work. In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross and others. In 1954 came the results of a study led by Richard Doll. This gave very strong statistical support to the suspicion that tobacco smoking was linked to lung cancer.\nImportant Concepts/Terms In Epidemiology.\nThere are several very key terms that epidemiologists use when discussing population health and disease outbreaks. The following, although not a comprehensive list, provides some of the key concepts that are important to understand when discussing epidemiology.\nIt is important to note that an endemic disease or cluster can become an epidemic. An example of this would be with malaria; although malaria is endemic to certain regions in South America, Africa, and South Asia, during certain years or times it can become an epidemic with higher number of cases then usual present in the population. In addition, it is also possible for epidemic or outbreak to progress and become a full-fledged pandemic.\nCalculating Disease Rates.\nRates refers to the number of cases occurring during a specific period of time and depends on the population size at that time. Calculating disease rates helps epidemiologists to compare health issues among different populations. The general calculation for determining disease rate is to divide the number of cases or health condition by the number of population at risk during a specific period of time, and multiplying that by 100. However, disease rates can also be differentiated into two different types: prevalence rate and incidence rate.\nPrevalence rate refers to the number of both old and new cases in a population during a specific time period, which is divided by the total number of cases in the population. Prevalence rates are useful when dealing with investigations relating to chronic diseases, which last for more than 3 months. On the other hand, incidence rate refers to the number of new health related conditions or cases which is divided by the population at risk. Incidence rates are important in studies involving acute diseases, where symptoms of a disease peak and subside within days or weeks and generally lasts less than 3 months.\nTypes of Epidemiological Studies.\nEpidemiological studies makes use of both experimental and observational studies. Experimental studies are ones where the epidemiologist can control and manipulate different variables throughout the experiment, and usually involves a placebo treatment/group. This type of study is used when epidemiologists are trying to determine the cause of a health issue/disease or evaluating the effectiveness of a cure or interventions. Observational studies include descriptive and analytical studies; descriptive studies investigates epidemiological cases with regards to TPP while analytical study investigates hypothesis regarding relationships between health issues and risk factors. While descriptive studies (TPP) answers questions of when, who, and where, analytical studies tries to answer the question of how a population is affected by a disease and why they are affected. Overall, observational studies do not manipulate any variables and often uses comparison groups for analysis; this type of study is often done in an attempt to discover the links between exposure to certain risk factors and health outcomes. Some examples of observational studies include cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies.\nProcess of Epidemiological Investigations.\nInvestigating an outbreak is a very involved multi-step process which ranges from first establishing the existence of an outbreak to communicating the findings of the investigation with the scientific community as well as the general population. The following is a rough sequence of the process of these investigations.\nProfessions In Epidemiology.\nEpidemiology\u00a0is a multidisciplinary subject. Members in this field mostly includes public health care workers and scientists from related fields such as chemists, biologists, geneticists, and anthropologists. People in epidemiology may work in hospital and research settings, as well as for federal organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). One particular unit that may be of interest for those pursuing epidemiology is with with Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), a subgroup within the CDC specializing in epidemiology. Epidemic Intelligence Service officers are field workers who investigate outbreaks in the US and other countries. Their work aids in understanding causes of outbreaks and quickly stopping spread of diseases from one place to another; notably, they have contributed to helping during various pandemics in the past, such as with smallpox, polio, and Ebola.\nMedical Anthropology &amp; Epidemiology.\nOne particular field that has had an impact in epidemiology is anthropology. In the past, cultural anthropologists have been a very helpful resource in bridging the gap between different countries/cultures and the epidemiological investigators. They have helped and continues to help with the development and implementation of preventative/control measures in countries in a manner that will not conflict with societal beliefs or values, which may get in the way of treatment or stopping the spread of an outbreak.\nIn recent years however, medical anthropology in particular has taken on a larger role in the field of epidemiology. Medical anthropology looks at biological, social, cultural, and linguistic anthropology to understand how these factors influence health and well-being, experience and distribution of illness, as well as prevention of treatment. As with cultural anthropologists, medical anthropologists have continued to aid in the development of public health policies. In particular, they have been very helpful in providing a unique perspective on public health discourse. For example, they investigate how culture affects research studies, are able to pick up on seemingly \"irrelevant\" yet important small details that an epidemiologist might miss, and they are able to provide qualitative data whereas epidemiology only focuses on quantitative data. One main thing of importance here is that while epidemiologist has largely ignored cultural factors when looking at the causes of diseases/health conditions, medical anthropology has challenged this notion and contributed to the field by showing how culture and social factors play a big role in people's willingness to follow public health guidelines/interventions or even accept treatment for their illnesses.\nWhereas the nature of epidemiological investigations may lead to a reductionist or limited point of view, medical anthropology provides a more holistic view of the problem and examines the issue from different angles to best understand and help the populations in need. Another critical contribution of medical anthropology has been with regard to critical qualitative data. While epidemiology is focused mainly on quantitative data and trends in health of the population, medical anthropology provides rich source of information on understanding the population's subjective experiences and providing qualitative data explaining why a particular intervention or treatment may have failed among a particular population. Their main contributions in recent years have come from modifying and helping develop epidemiological surveys by taking into account word choice and the \"social suitability\" of questions, so that responses would be more accurate and thereby helping to increase the validity of the questionnaires. It has also been found that medical anthropologists have played a large role in helping locals better understand the objectives of epidemiologists and thereby helped them become more receptive of their investigations. In addition to all these, one of the major contributions of medical anthropology has come from its ability to help explain health phenomenon and create and test hypothesis relating to such explanations, in a way that epidemiologists have been unable to due to their strict focus on quantitative data. In short, while epidemiology is good at understanding numerical patterns and biological causes for disease/health conditions, it is unable to fully explain all the factors that underlie certain diseases/health conditions, and this is a gap that medical anthropology has been able to pick up on and complement by providing rich qualitative data which looks at health and diseases from a holistic perspective.\nSome notable mentions of medical anthropologists who have worked and contributed to epidemiology and public health in general include Dr. Jim Kim and Paul Farmer. Dr. Jim Kim served as the president of the World Bank while Paul Farmer is a physician and medical anthropologists who focuses on infectious diseases and treatment. Both of these men co-founded the Partners in Health (PIH) program, which provided free health care to the poorest populations in countries like Haiti, Peru, and Rwanda. Other notable mentions are Amber Wutich and Alexandra Brewis, both of whom are professors and researchers at Arizona State University. They focus on health impacts caused by resource scarcity, specifically relating to lack of access to clean water in developing countries. Wutich is a director of the Global Ethnohydrology study which looks at water knowledge and management in ten countries, while Brewis researches the impact of culture on human biology.\nPopulation-based health management.\nEpidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to health management\nModern population-based health management is complex. Epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component. This task requires the forward looking ability to guide how a health system responds to current health issues, and how a health system can respond to future potential population health issues."}

Such devices often have a bag or bag attachment. The \u2018poop bag\u2019 is usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. The person performing the cleanup might also be called a pooper-scooper.\nLegislation.\nA number of places, including New York City, have laws telling pet owners to clean up after their pets after the pet has pooped on a sidewalk or any public place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any public or private premises used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a building abutting on a public. Authorized employees of New York City Departments of Health (including Animal Care &amp; Control), of Sanitation, or of Parks and Recreation can issue tickets.\nHealth concerns.\nPet droppings contaminate the environment with bacteria, parasites and stench. The droppings are one of the leading sources of \"E. coli\" (fecal coliforms) bacterial pollution: one gram of dog feces contains over 20,000,000 \"E. coli\" cells. Coliform bacteria and \"E. coli\" are commonly-used field indicators of fecal contamination by animals (including human). Pet droppings contain eggs of Toxocara canis and Neospora caninum parasitic worms. In adult dogs infection with T.canis usually asymptomatic but can be fatal in puppies.T. canis can cause parasitic worm infection and rarely blindness in humans. N.caninum causes severe losses in livestock breeding. While an individual animal's deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment, the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area creates serious problems due to contamination of soil and water supplies. The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water, creates health hazards for people, fish, ducks, etc.\nThe situation is particularly dire in Germany, where an estimated 1400 tonnes of feces are deposited daily on public property. A citizen commission (2005) overwhelmingly recommended a plan. DNA samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal. Within a year, a database of some 12,500 registration-required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample-test kits. Evidence would be submitted to a forensics laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog. The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to $600 US (at 2005 exchange rate) would help assure preventive compliance, as well as cover costs."}

The general idea, however, is that something is metastable if it is not changing, yet given a small force (\"nudge\") it will transition to another, more stable state. \nFor example, a block is sitting on a slope (an \"inclined plane\"). It keeps sitting there until it is nudged, or the slope is gently struck, setting up vibrations. Then the block starts to slide. At that point it keeps sliding until it reaches the bottom. The block sitting at the bottom is stable. The block sitting on the slope but not moving is metastable. And the block as it is moving is unstable. \nA real life example of this is an avalanche of snow. The avalanche is unstable (the snow is sliding down the mountainside). When the avalanche is over the snow is stable. Before the avalanche starts, the snow is metastable, since some small perturbation is enough to cause it to lose what might have seemed to be stability, but in fact was only metastability."}

{"id": "245986", "revid": "7716691", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245986", "title": "Planck constant", "text": "The Planck constant (Planck's constant) says how much the energy of a photon increases, when the frequency of its electromagnetic wave increases by 1 (In SI Units). It is named after the physicist Max Planck. The Planck constant is a fundamental physical constant. It is written as h.\nThe Planck constant has dimensions of physical action: energy multiplied by time, or momentum multiplied by distance. In SI units, the Planck constant is expressed in joule seconds (J\u22c5s) or (N\u22c5m\u22c5s) or (kg\u22c5m2\u22c5s\u22121).\nThe symbols are defined here.\nIn SI Units the Planck constant is exactly J\u00b7s (by definition). Scientists have used this quantity to calculate measurements like the Planck length and the Planck time.\nBackground.\nBetween 1670 and 1900 scientists discussed the nature of light. Some scientists believed that light consisted of many millions of tiny particles. Other scientists believed that light was a wave.\nLight: waves or particles?\nIn 1678, Christiaan Huygens wrote the book \"Trait\u00e9 de la lumiere\" (\"Treatise on light\"). He believed that light was made up of waves. He said that light could not be made up of particles because light from two beams do not bounce off each other.\nIn 1672, Isaac Newton wrote the book \"Opticks\". He believed that light was made up of red, yellow and blue particles which he called corpusles. Newton explained this by his \"two prism experiment\". The first prism broke light up into different colours. The second prism merged these colours back into white light.\nDuring the 18th century, Newton's theory was given the most attention. In 1803, Thomas Young described the \"double-slit experiment\". In this experiment, light going through two narrow slits interferes with itself. This causes a pattern which shows that light is made up of waves. For the rest of the nineteenth century, the wave theory of light was given the most attention. In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell developed equations that described electromagnetic radiation as waves.\nThe theory of electromagnetic radiation treats light, radio waves, microwaves and many other types of wave as the same thing except that they have different wavelengths. The wavelength of the light we can see with our eyes is roughly between 400 and 600\u00a0nm. The wavelength of radio waves varies from 10\u00a0m to 1500\u00a0m and the wavelength of microwaves is about 2\u00a0cm. In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is given by:\nThe symbols are defined here.\nBlack body radiators.\nAll warm things give off thermal radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation. For most things on Earth this radiation is in the infra-red range, but something very hot (1000\u00a0\u00b0C or more), gives off visible radiation, that is, light. In the late 1800's many scientists studied the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from black-body radiators at different temperatures.\nRayleigh-Jeans Law.\nLord Rayleigh first published the basics of the Rayleigh-Jeans law in 1900. The theory was based on the Kinetic theory of gasses. Sir James Jeans published a more complete theory in 1905. The law relates the quantity and wavelength of electromagnetic energy given off by a black body radiator at different temperatures. The equation describing this is: \nFor long-wavelength radiation, the results predicted by this equation corresponded well with practical results obtained in a laboratory. However, for short wavelengths (ultraviolet light) the difference between theory and practice were so large that it earned the nickname \"the ultra-violet catastrophe\".\nPlanck's Law.\nin 1895 Wien published the results of his studies into the radiation from a black body. His formula was:\nThis formula worked well for short wavelength electromagnetic radiation, but did not work well with long wavelengths.\nIn 1900 Max Planck published the results of his studies. He tried to develop an expression for black-body radiation expressed in terms of wavelength by assuming that radiation consisted of small quanta and then to see what happened if the quanta were made infinitely small. (This is a standard mathematical approach). The expression was:\nIf the wavelength of light is allowed to become very large, then it can be shown that the Raleigh-Jeans and the Planck relationships are almost identical.\nHe calculated \"h\" and \"k\" and found that\nThe values are close to the modern day accepted values of and respectively. The Planck law agrees well with the experimental data, but its full significance was only appreciated several years later.\nQuantum theory of light.\nIt turns out that electrons are dislodged by the photoelectric effect if light reaches a threshold frequency. Below this no electrons can be emitted from the metal. In 1905 Albert Einstein published a paper explaining the effect. Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy. Einstein said that the effect was due to a photon striking an electron. This demonstrated the particle nature of light.\nEinstein also found that electromagnetic radiation with a long wavelength had no effect. Einstein said that this was because the \"particles\" did not have enough energy to disturb the electrons.\nPlanck suggested that the energy of each photon was related to the photon frequency by the Planck constant. This could be written mathematically as:\nPlanck received the Nobel Prize in 1918 in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta. In 1921 Einstein received the Nobel Prize for linking the Planck constant to the photoelectric effect.\nApplication.\nThe Planck constant is of importance in many applications. A few are listed below.\nBohr model of the atom.\nIn 1913 Niels Bohr published the Bohr model of the structure of an atom. Bohr said that the angular momentum of the electrons going around the nucleus can only have certain values. These values are given by the equation\nwhere\nThe Bohr model of the atom can be used to calculate the energy of electrons at each level. Electrons will normally fill up the lowest numbered states of an atom. If the atom receives energy from, for example, an electric current, electrons will be excited into a higher state. The electrons will then drop back to a lower state and will lose their extra energy by giving off a photon. Because the energy levels have specific values, the photons will have specific energy levels. Light emitted in this way can be split into different colours using a prism. Each element has its own pattern. The pattern for neon is shown alongside.\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle.\nIn 1927 Werner Heisenberg published the uncertainty principle. The principle states that it is not possible to make a measurement without disturbing the thing being measured. It also puts a limit on the minimum disturbance caused by making a measurement.\nIn the macroscopic world these disturbances make very little difference. For example, if the temperature of a flask of liquid is measured, the thermometer will absorb a small amount of energy as it heats up. This will cause a small error in the final reading, but this error is small and not important.\nIn quantum mechanics things are different. Some measurements are made by looking at the pattern of scattered photons. One such example is Compton scattering. If both the position and momentum of a particle is being measured, the uncertainty principle states that there is a trade-off between the accuracy with which the momentum is measured and the accuracy with which the position is measured. The equation that describes this trade-off is: \nwhere\nColour of light emitting diodes.\nIn the electric circuit shown on the right, the voltage drop across the light emitting diode (LED) depends on the material of the LED. For silicon diodes the drop is 0.6\u00a0V. However for LEDs it is between 1.8\u00a0V and 2.7\u00a0V. This information enables a user to calculate the Planck constant.\nThe energy needed for one electron to jump the potential barrier in the LED material is given by \nwhere\nWhen the electron decays back again, it emits one photon of light. The energy of the photon is given by\nthe same equation used in the photoelectric effect. If these equations are combined, the wavelength of light and the voltage are related by\nThe table below can be calculated from this relationship.\nValue of the Planck constant and the kilogram redefinition.\nSince its discovery, measurements of h have become much better. Planck first quoted the value of h to be erg\u00b7sec. This value is within 5% of the current value.\nAs of 3 March 2014, the best measurements of h in SI units is \u00a0J\u00b7s. The equivalent figure in cgs units is \u00a0erg\u00b7sec. The relative uncertainty of h is .\nThe reduced Planck constant (\u0127) is a value that is sometimes used in quantum mechanics. It is defined by\nPlanck units are sometimes used in quantum mechanics instead of SI. In this system the reduced Planck constant has a value of 1, so the value of the Planck constant is 2\u03c0.\nPlancks constant can now be measured with very high precision. This has caused the BIPM to consider a new definition for the kilogram. The international prototype kilogram is no longer used to define the kilogram. Instead the BIPM defines the Planck constant to have an exact value. Scientists use this value and the definitions of the metre and the second to define the kilogram.\nValue of Theoretical Planck constant.\nThe Planck constant can also be mathematically derived:\nformula_11\nHere, formula_12 is the permeability of free space, formula_13 is the speed of light, formula_14 is the electric charge of electron, formula_15 is the Bohr's radius, and formula_16 is the frequency of revolution of the electron in a hydrogen atom formula_17. When these constant values are substituted to the theoretical Planck constant, the theoretical Planck constant value is exactly equal to the experimental value.\nThe Planck's constant elementary formula in terms of proton-to-electron mass ratio, the charge of electron, speed of light and vacuum permittivity is derived in. It is expressed as follows:\nformula_18\nwhere formula_19 is the elementary charge of an electron, formula_20 the mass of a proton, formula_21the mass of an electron, formula_22 the vacuum permittivity, and formula_13 the speed of light."}

It influences the architecture, food, music, and overall \"feel\" of the restaurant. The food usually takes a backseat to the presentation of the theme. These restaurants generally attract customers only because of the theme itself.\nOne example is the \"Rainforest Cafe\" restaurants which have the obvious theme of a \"Tropical Rainforest\". \"Medieval Times\" has its theme of \"Medieval Europe\". The \"Jekyll &amp; Hyde Club\" has an atmosphere of Jack the Ripper and Victorian horror novels. One strange but famous theme restaurant in Berlin, Germany is called \"das Klo\" (German for \"The toilet\"). It shows the insides of a toilet.\nMany people consider the Rainforest Cafe to be biggest example of a theme restaurant. They also consider it the restaurant which kicked off the theme restaurant trend. Theme restaurants may be experiencing a decline in popularity, given the closings of several Planet Hollywood, Jekyll &amp; Hyde Club, and Wilderness Cafe locations in recent years. Theme restaurants often depend on tourist business, since the theme soon becomes stale to locals. The focus is not necessarily placed on good food and service. Certain tourist destinations such as the Mall of America or Orlando, Florida have better chances of supporting theme restaurants. Theme restaurants are generally common at theme parks, such as Universal Studios."}

Before being bought by Henderson Private Equity in December 2006, John Laing plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was part of the FTSE 250 Index.\nHistory.\nThe business started in 1848. James Laing (born in 1816), along with his wife Ann Graham, and some employees whom they had hired, built a house on a plot of land that they had bought for \u00a330 in Cumberland. The \u00a3150 proceeds from the first house financed the building of the next two houses on the same plot of land. One of these houses was kept by the Laing Family to live in. The family and the business later moved near Carlisle.\nWhen James Laing died in 1882, his son, John Laing (born in 1842) took over the running of the company. John began to take larger contracts but kept the business in the Carlisle area.\nJohn's son, John William Laing, (born in 1879) was working for the business before he was 20 years old, and so it became John Laing and Son. By 1910, John William Laing was running the business. More employees were recruited and larger projects were undertaken, including factory construction.\nIn 1920 the firm became a limited company, and two years later moved its headquarters from Carlisle to a thirteen acre (5 ha) site at Mill Hill in north-west London.\nWilliam Kirby Laing and John Maurice Laing, the fifth generation of the founding family, joined the company in 1950.\nJohn Laing &amp; Sons (Holdings) Ltd was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1952. The family and its trusts and charities held the majority of the shares. John William Laing became the chairman, and his sons became joint managing directors. By this time, the number of employees was around 10,000, and every site had a quality supervisor. John William Laing retired in 1957.\nUnder William Kirby Laing and James Maurice Laing, the company continued to expand. They gained contracts for power stations. They also worked on road construction while continuing to build houses. In 1985, Martin Laing, of the sixth generation of the founding family, became chairman.\nMartin Laing determined that the company should begin to diversify. Home construction in the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Spain, and California was now one of the major sources of the company's growth.\nAs the company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998, it faced falling profits caused by cost overruns on the Millennium project and continuing problems within its construction division, related to competition and overcapacity.\nIn 1999 John Laing plc purchased a controlling interest in the Chiltern Rail franchise and by 2002 had structured itself into two main divisions, namely Homes and Investments. It underwent yet another change when Sir Martin Laing retired in early 2002. Bill Forrester took over as executive chairman. For the first time in its history Laing did not have a member of the founding family at the head of the company.\nThe business expanded rapidly in the late 1990s, such that for the year ended 31 December 2001 its turnover was in excess of \u00a31 billion. Following significant losses on certain construction contracts it adopted a new policy of having the PPP / PFI businesses, in which it had been quite successful, as core activities. As a consequence it disposed of its construction division, which was sold to O'Rourke in 2001, its property developments divisions, which were sold to Kier Group, and its house building arm which was sold to George Wimpey in 2002.\nIn December 2006 John Laing plc was acquired by the Private Equity arm of Henderson Group.\nThe Laing Rail division - operators of Chiltern Railways and London Overground (with MTR Corporation), and holders of a stake in the open-access railway operator Wrexham &amp; Shropshire - was put up for sale by in September 2007. The division was purchased by German rail operator Deutsche Bahn in January 2008, subject to approval by authorities.\nIn June 2008 John Laing formed a consortium with Hitachi and Barclays Private Equity called Agility Trains to bid for the contract to design, manufacture, and maintain a fleet of long-distance trains for the Intercity Express Programme. The bid was successful and the contract was awarded to the consortium on the 12 February 2009.\nCurrent operations.\nJohn Laing now has operations in the UK, North America, Europe and Asia.\nFormer operations.\nLaing Construction.\nJohn Laing\u2019s former construction division, Laing Construction, undertook a number of landmark projects including:\nThe M1 motorway completed in 1959, Coventry Cathedral completed in 1962, Clifton Cathedral completed in 1973, the Sizewell B nuclear power station completed in 1995, the Second Severn Crossing completed in 1996, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff completed in 1999 and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital completed in 2001.\nLaing Rail.\nThe subsidiary Laing Rail owned and operated Chiltern Railways and was joint operator of London Overground (with MTR Corporation) and Wrexham &amp; Shropshire (with Renaissance Trains).

He made his debut for the Denmark national team in March 2010, and was the youngest player of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. \nIn 2011, Eriksen was named Danish Football Player of the Year, Dutch Football Talent of the Year, Ajax Talent of the Year (Marco van Basten Award), and made the UEFA Euro U-21 Team of the Tournament. He won the Eredivisie with Ajax in 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, and in 2012\u201313 before signing with Tottenham Hotspur in August 2013. He won the Tottenham Hotspur Player of the Year award for the 2013\u201314 season and in 2015, he won the Danish Football Player of the Year award for the second year in a row.\nClub career.\nEarly career in Middelfart and Odense.\nEriksen started playing football in his hometown Middelfart before his third birthday. In 2005 he switched to Odense Boldklub, who competed in the Danish youth championships. His team lost the semi-final against Br\u00f8ndby IF, but afterwards he was named \"Best Technical Player\" of the tournament. The following year OB won the tournament, when Eriksen scored the only goal in the final. After some good performances for OB's U-16 team and later on U-19 team and the Danish U-17 team, major European football clubs including Chelsea and Barcelona began to take notice. The player had trials with Barcelona, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Milan, but finally decided to move to Ajax, stating \"My first step should not be too big. I knew that playing in the Netherlands would be very good for my development. Then Ajax arrived and that was a fantastic option\".\nAFC Ajax.\nYouth &amp; entrance in the first squad.\nOn 17 October 2008 it was announced that Eriksen had signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Amsterdam-based Ajax. The transfer fee received by OB was estimated at \u20ac1 million (\u00a3847,199). He worked his way through the youth teams, and was promoted to the first team squad in January 2010, where he was given the number 51 shirt. Within the month, he made his first team debut for the Dutch team in the Eredivisie on 17 January 2010 against NAC Breda. Ajax manager Martin Jol compared him to the likes of Ajax youth products Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart and described him as a good reader of the game in the traditional \"number 10\" role like the two Dutch internationals and Danish legend Michael Laudrup, who also played for Ajax.\nOn 25 March 2010 he scored his first goal for Ajax in a 6\u20130 win against opponent Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Cup. On 10 April 2010, Eriksen extended his contract with Ajax until the summer of 2014, stating \"I can still learn a lot here, I'm not finished yet and I hope I can mean a lot for the club.\" On 6 May 2010, Eriksen played in the second match of the final of the 2009\u201310 Dutch Cup as Ajax beat Feyenoord 1\u20134, with 1\u20136 on aggregate. At the end of his first professional season at Ajax, Eriksen had played 21 competitive matches, scoring one goal, and had made his international debut for Denmark. For his second season in the first team of Ajax, Eriksen was given the number 8 shirt.\nBreakthrough season.\nEriksen started the 2010\u201311 season well, scoring his first Ajax league goal on 29 August 2010 in an away victory over De Graafschap. On 11 November 2010, Eriksen scored his first goal at the Amsterdam ArenA a 3\u20130 Cup victory over BV Veendam. In December, Eriksen was named Danish \"Talent of the Year\". Several days after receiving this award, Eriksen once again proved his value to Ajax by scoring the only goal in a 0\u20131 away league victory over Vitesse. On 17 February 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in a European tournament, the Ajax goal to 2\u20130, when Ajax beat Anderlecht 3\u20130 in the 2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League. On 13 March 2011, Eriksen scored a solo goal, running from the half way line to finish it off with a strike to secure a 3\u20131 win over Willem II.\nDuring the rest of the season, Eriksen became more and more important for Ajax, due to his growing capabilities as the team's playmaker, providing many assists. After a good season during which he developed himself into an undisputed starter in the side that won the 2010\u201311 Eredivisie (Ajax's first Eredivisie title in seven years), he was named Ajax's Talent of the Year. On 23 May 2011 he was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year, the second Danish player to win the award since Jon Dahl Tomasson in 1996. He was elected by a jury under command of Holland's all-time best player Johan Cruyff. \"\"He's a player I really like with all my heart,\" Cruyff praised Eriksen. \"This prize is just the beginning, a stimulus to get the maximum out of his career. The talent is there, the recognition also; now it is up to the player himself. He is a typical product of the Danish school. You can compare him with Brian and Michael Laudrup. Only time will tell if Eriksen can reach the same level as them.\"\".\nRising influence in the squad.\nOn 18 October 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League when Ajax beat Dinamo Zagreb 2\u20130 in the group stage, making him the 2nd youngest player to score in the 2011\u201312 season. In the second match versus Dinamo Zagreb on 2 November he provided assists to Gregory van der Wiel and Siem de Jong as well as being involved with the third goal, as Ajax cruised to a 4\u20130 victory. He was named Danish Football Player of the Year on 7 November after helping Ajax win the Eredivisie the previous year and guiding the national team to a successful Euro 2012 qualification campaign, after receiving the award Eriksen said, \"I am extremely honoured to be standing here tonight. I did not expect it, it really means a lot to me. I would like to thank my team-mates in the national team as well as my team-mates at Ajax\". Following the success of Eriksen's third consecutive Eredivisie title in the 2012\u201313 season, he opted not to renew his contract with Ajax, and with one year still remaining on his current contract he was permitted to search for a new club. Having come to terms with Tottenham Hotspur in England, Eriksen left Ajax having appeared in 113 league matches, scoring 25 goals and 41 assists. He played in 16 matches for the KNVB Cup, scoring four goals and making four assists. He made 30 appearances on the continental stage for Ajax, scoring three goals, and making 9 assists all together. Having also competed in the Johan Cruijff Shield three years in a row.\nTottenham Hotspur.\n2013\u201314 season.\nOn 30 August 2013, Tottenham Hotspur announced that they had completed the transfer of Eriksen from Ajax, in a deal believed to be worth \u00a311 million (\u20ac13.5 million), after Eriksen passed a medical at the club. Eriksen joined the club on the same day as Erik Lamela, who joined from Roma, and Vlad Chiriche\u0219, who joined from Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, and took the club's total spending for the 2013 summer transfer window to \u00a3109.5 million.\nOn 14 September 2013, he made his Premier League debut against Norwich City, providing an assist for Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson. \"Spurs\" manager Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas commented: \"It was a great debut for Christian, he is a pure number 10, a creative player and his individual quality made all the difference.\"\nOn 19 September 2013, Eriksen \"clipped a wonderful dipping shot\" over the goalkeeper to score his first Tottenham goal and complete a 3\u20130 win over Troms\u00f8 IL in the Europa League. He added to his Tottenham goal tally with a goal from a free kick in a 1\u20131 draw against West Bromwich Albion on Boxing Day 2013, and the second goal in \"Spurs\"' 2\u20131 win against Manchester United on 1 January 2014. On 23 March, after goals from Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana had given Southampton a 2\u20130 lead against Tottenham at White Hart Lane, Eriksen scored twice to level the score and assisted Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson to score the winning goal.\nOn 12 April 2014, he scored a stoppage-time equalizer as \"Spurs\" came from 3\u20130 down to draw 3\u20133 at West Bromwich Albion. By the end of the season, Eriksen had scored 7 goals in the Premier League.\n2014\u201315 season.\nThroughout the 2014/15 campaign, Eriksen played an integral part in many Spurs victories. The Danish international had a habit of scoring late winners, most notably against Swansea City, Sunderland, Hull City and many others.\nOn 10 January 2015, Eriksen was voted Danish Football Player of the Year twice in a row, making him the first player to do so since William Kvist.\nOn 28 January 2015, Eriksen completed his greatest performance of the campaign in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Sheffield United to send Tottenham into the League Cup Final. His first goal, a 30-yard curling free kick, was plauded by the likes of Michael Owen and Gary Neville among others on Twitter. Despite a late threat from the Blades, Eriksen then scored a second late-on to send Spurs to Wembley.\nEriksen completed the 2014/15 campaign having featured in every Premier League game for Mauricio Pochettino. The Dane became the third Spurs player to reach double figures in the league, alongside Nacer Chadli and Harry Kane, scoring 10 goals.\nOn 9 June 2015, Eriksen confirmed to Danish media whilst on international duty that he would stay at Tottenham for the foreseeable future. Eriksen was quoted as saying: \"I feel right at home at Tottenham and I haven't thought about leaving yet.\"\nInternational career.\nYouth squads.\nEriksen was called up to the Denmark national under-17 football team in July 2007, and impressed in his debut for the team on 31 July. In 2008, he scored 9 goals in 16 games for the U-17s, and was named Danish \"U-17 Talent of the Year\" by the Danish FA. He was also one of four nominees for the 2008 Danish \"Talent of the Year\" award, which was won by Mathias J\u00f8rgensen. He played 27 games for the under-17 team until February 2009. He played a total of 8 games for the Denmark U-18 and Denmark U-19 teams during 2009. Eriksen was also called up for the Danish U-21 squad to the European championship in Denmark in 2011, the Danish team only participated in the group stage and Eriksen scored a goal against Belarus.\nSenior squad.\nHe received his first senior Denmark call-up in February 2010, making his debut in Denmark's friendly match against Austria in March, to become Denmark's fourth youngest full international, being the youngest debutant since Michael Laudrup.\nOn 28 May 2010, Denmark coach Morten Olsen announced that Eriksen would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He was the youngest player participating in the tournament. At the World Cup, Eriksen played two matches, against the Netherlands and Japan, but Denmark were unable to progress beyond the group stage.\nOn 9 February 2011, in a 1\u20132 friendly loss at home against England, Eriksen was named Man of the Match, and was praised for his performance by a number of prominent footballing figures, including Chelsea star Frank Lampard, Man Utd star Rio Ferdinand (on Twitter), manager Morten Olsen and several media experts in Denmark and England. On 4 June 2011 Eriksen scored his first national team goal, to give Denmark a 2\u20130 lead over Iceland in their Euro 2012 qualifier. In doing so, he became the youngest Danish player ever to score a goal in European qualification, being 9 days younger than Michael Laudrup when he scored his first goal in 1983.\nOn 10 January 2015, Eriksen was voted Danish Football Player of the Year twice in a row, making him the first player to do so since William Kvist.\nSponsorship.\nIn 2012, Eriksen signed a sponsorship kit deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, Nike. He appeared in an advert for the new Nike Green Speed II alongside Raheem Sterling, Stephan El Shaarawy, Mario G\u00f6tze, Eden Hazard and Theo Walcott in November 2012.\nChristian then transitioned from Nike's Mercurial range, to the more 'creative' orientated Magista."}

His company, Foster and Partners, has an international design practice. He is the United Kingdom's biggest builder of landmark office buildings.\nHe is one of Britain's most prolific architects of his generation.\u00a0In 1999, he was awarded the\u00a0Pritzker Architecture Prize, often referred to as the\u00a0Nobel Prize\u00a0of architecture. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category.\nBiography.\nEarly life\nFoster was born to Robert Foster and Lilian Smith\u00a0in 1935 in\u00a0Reddish,\u00a0Stockport, Cheshire. They moved, soon after his birth, two miles to 4 Crescent Grove in\u00a0Levenshulme,\u00a0Manchester, which they rented for fourteen\u00a0shillings\u00a0(70p) a week:\u00a0Foster has no recollection of Reddish. Foster's parents were diligent, hard workers \u2013 so diligent that Foster, as an only child, felt their heavy workload restricted his relationship with them and he was often looked after by neighbours or other family members.\u00a0He attended\u00a0Burnage Grammar School for Boys\u00a0in\u00a0Burnage. In a\u00a0\"Guardian\"\u00a0interview in 1999, Foster said he always felt 'different' at school and was bullied and he retired into the world of books.\u00a0He considered himself quiet and awkward in his early years often making faux pas.\nFoster described Manchester as \"one of the workshops of the world\"\u00a0and \"the embodiment of a great city\",\u00a0his father, Robert, worked at\u00a0Metropolitan-Vickers,\u00a0Trafford Park\u00a0which fuelled Foster's interest in engineering and design.\u00a0He was fascinated with engineering and the process of designing. He says that caused him to pursue a career designing buildings.\u00a0Specific interests included aircraft, a hobby he maintains today;\u00a0and trains, generated by viewing passing trains on the railway outside his terraced home during his childhood.\nHe left school at 16 and worked in the Manchester City Treasurer's office. Next, he joined the National Service in the Royal Air Force. After he was discharged, in 1956 Foster attended the University of Manchester's School of Architecture and City Planning. He graduated in 1961. Later, Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he earned his Master's degree Foster also met Richard Rogers at Yale. He then travelled in America for a year. He returned to the UK in 1963. Then he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams. This allowed them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.\nEducation\nFoster took a job as assistant to a contract manager with John Bearshaw and Partners, a local architectural practice.\u00a0\u00a0The staff advised him, that if he wished to become an architect, he should prepare a portfolio of drawings using the\u00a0perspective\u00a0and\u00a0shop drawings\u00a0from Bearshaw's practice as an example.\u00a0Bearshaw was so impressed with the drawings that he promoted the young Foster to the drawing department of the practice.\nIn 1956 Foster won a place at the\u00a0University of Manchester\u00a0School of Architecture and City Planning. Foster was not eligible for a\u00a0maintenance grant\u00a0so took up a number of part-time jobs to fund his studies,\u00a0becoming an ice-cream salesman, night-club bouncer\u00a0and working night shifts at a bakery to make\u00a0crumpets.\u00a0He combined these with self-tuition via visits to the local library in Levenshulme.\u00a0Foster took a keen interest in the works of\u00a0Frank Lloyd Wright,\u00a0Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,\u00a0Le Corbusier\u00a0and\u00a0Oscar Niemeyer\u00a0and graduated from Manchester in 1961.\nFoster won the Henry Fellowship to the\u00a0Yale School of Architecture, where he met future business partner\u00a0Richard Rogers\u00a0and earned his master's degree.\u00a0Vincent Scully\u00a0encouraged Foster and Rogers to travel in America for a year.\u00a0After returning to the UK in 1963 he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters\u00a0Georgie\u00a0and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams allowing them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for\u00a0high-tech\u00a0industrial design.\nFoster + Partners.\nAfter Team 4 went their separate ways, Foster and Wendy Cheesman founded Foster Associates, which later became\u00a0Foster and Partners\u00a0in 1967. A long period of collaboration with American architect\u00a0Richard Buckminster Fuller\u00a0began in 1968 and continued until Fuller's death in 1983. They collaborated on several projects that became catalysts in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design \u2013 including the Samuel Beckett Theatre project.\nOriginally they concentrated on industrial buildings. The turning point was the 1969 administrative and leisure center for\u00a0Fred. Olsen Lines\u00a0in\u00a0London Docklands, where workers and managers are not separated any more.\u00a0Foster and Partners' breakthrough building in the UK was the\u00a0Willis Faber &amp; Dumas headquarters\u00a0in\u00a0Ipswich, of 1974. The client was a family run insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. Foster created\u00a0open plan\u00a0office floors long before open-plan became the norm. In a town not over-endowed with public facilities, the roof gardens, 25\u00a0metre swimming pool and gymnasium enhanced the quality of life for the company's 1200 employees.\u00a0The building has a full-height glass\u00a0fa\u00e7ade\u00a0moulded to the medieval street plan and contributes drama, subtly shifting from opaque, reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets. The design was inspired by the Daily Express Building in Manchester a work Foster admired in his youth. The building is now\u00a0Grade I* listed.\nThe\u00a0Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, an art gallery and museum on the campus of the\u00a0University of East Anglia,\u00a0Norwich, was one of the first major public buildings to be designed by Foster, completed in 1978, and became grade II* listed in December 2012. In 1990 Foster's design for the Terminal Building at\u00a0London Stansted Airport\u00a0was awarded the\u00a0European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award.\nFoster gained a reputation for designing office buildings. In the 1980s he designed the\u00a0HSBC Main Building\u00a0in\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0for\u00a0HSBC. The building is marked by its high level of light transparency, as all 3500 workers have a view to\u00a0Victoria Peak\u00a0or\u00a0Victoria Harbour.\u00a0Foster said that if the firm had not won the contract it would probably have been bankrupted. Foster believes that attracting young talent is essential, and is proud that the average age of people working for Foster and Partners is 32, just like it was in 1967.\nPresent day.\nToday, Foster + Partners works with its engineers to use computer systems. They pay attention to basic physical laws such as convection. They have created efficient buildings like the Swiss Re London headquarters in London. The walls let in air for passive cooling and then let it out as it warms and rises.\nFoster's earlier designs reflected a sophisticated, machine-influenced high-tech vision. His style has evolved into a more sharp-edged modernity. In 2004, Foster designed the\u00a0tallest bridge in the world, the\u00a0Millau Viaduct\u00a0in\u00a0Southern France, with the Millau Mayor Jacques Godfrain stating; \"The architect, Norman Foster, gave us a model of art.\"\nIn January 2007, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not want to retire, but wants to sell his 80-90% holding in the company valued at \u00a3300M to \u00a3500M.\nFoster is a member of the board of Trustees for the architectural charity Article 25. They design, construct and manage safe, sustainable buildings in dangerous parts of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.\nThe reason for his wealth is he receives 15% of the building cost.\nIn 2007, he worked with\u00a0Philippe Starck\u00a0and\u00a0Sir Richard Branson\u00a0of the\u00a0Virgin Group\u00a0for the\u00a0Virgin Galactic\u00a0plans.\nFoster designed the Apple Campus in Cupertino and is currently designing most of their Apple stores. He is also designing Bloomberg's headquarters in London. He also recently designed the Monaco Yacht club and the McLaren technology centre.\nFoster currently sits on the Board of Trustees at architectural charity\u00a0Article 25\u00a0who design, construct and manage innovative, safe, sustainable buildings in some of the most inhospitable and unstable regions of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of\u00a0the Architecture Foundation.\nHe has recently set up the Norman Foster Foundation which promotes interdisciplinary thinking and research to help new generations of architects, designers and urbanists to anticipate the future.\nFoster recently set up his personal Instagram account under the username @officialnormanfoster where he publishes photos of his everyday life\nRecognition.\nFoster was knighted in 1990 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1997. In 1999, he was created a life peer, as Baron Foster of Thames Bank, of Reddish in the County of Greater Manchester. He was a Crossbencher; he resigned from the House of Lords in 2010 because he refused to pat UK taxes on his foreign earnings.\nNorman Foster is the second British architect to win the Stirling Prize twice: the first for the American Air Museum at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 1998, and the second for 30 St Mary Axe in 2004.\nFoster was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1999.\nHe is also a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal, the Society's highest award. In Germany Lord Foster received the Order Pour le M\u00e9rite.\nMost recently, in September 2007, Foster was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, the largest architectural award in the world, for the University of Technology Petronas, in Malaysia.\nIt was announced in January 2008 that Foster was to be awarded an honorary degree from the Dundee School of Architecture at the University of Dundee. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the category \"Arts\".\nIn 2012, Foster was among the\u00a0British cultural icons\u00a0selected by artist Sir\u00a0Peter Blake\u00a0to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork \u2013 the Beatles'\u00a0\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\"\u00a0album cover \u2013 to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\nIn 2017, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London for his contribution to contemporary architecture.\nPersonal life.\nFoster married business partner Wendy Cheesman. She died in 1989, leaving him with four sons. whilst he was greiving, he was also diagnosed with bowel cancer. He next married Indian-born Begum Sabiha Rumani Malik. Sabiha was married to Andrew Knight when she and Foster met. Knight was Chairman of News International. Foster and Sabiha divorced in 1998. Foster is now married to Elena Ochoa, Chairman of the Tate International Council, and founder of Ivory Press. He has five children and three grandchildren.\nFoster flies his own private jet and helicopter between his homes in London, France, Switzerland, Marthas Vineyard, New York and Madrid.\nSelected projects.\nFoster has established an extremely prolific career in the span of four decades. The following are some of his major constructions:\nHigher education[edit].\nThe Bow, Calgary, Canada, 500 Centre Street SE\nLondon, UK (1993\u20132001)\nNon-architectural projects.\nFoster's other design work has included the Nomos desk system for Italian manufacturer Tecno, and the motor yacht \"Izanami\" (later \"Ronin\") for L\u00fcrssen Yachts."}

He is known for innovative use of engineering and materials in public monuments and sculptures. He heads the Heatherwick Studio, which he founded in 1994.\nBiography.\nBorn in London, he studied three dimensional design at Manchester Polytechnic and at the Royal College of Art, winning several prizes. Shortly after graduating from the Royal College of Art after a two-year furniture MA course in 1994, he was commissioned by Harvey Nichols department store in Knightsbridge to design a temporary structure for the shop's facade. His design was a ribbon of laminated wood that wound through the storefront windows. The design was widely acclaimed and won him a D&amp;AD yellow pencil (the gold award) in 1997.\nHe founded Thomas Heatherwick Studio (now called just Heatherwick Studio) in 1994. His aim was \"to bring architecture, design and sculpture together within a single practice\". Originally based at Camden Mews, the studio moved to larger premises in Kings Cross in 2000. It presently comprises a thirty-strong team which includes architects, landscape architects, designers and engineers. Work is carried out from a combined studio and workshop where concept development, detailing, prototyping and small scale fabrication take place. The studio's work spans commercial and residential building projects, masterplanning and infrastructure schemes as well as high profile works of public art. \nHeatherwick is a Senior Fellow and external examiner at the Royal College of Art. He is a fellow of the Royal Academy and was recently chosen to become a Royal Designer for Industry. He has served on numerous judging and advisory panels and has given talks at various institutions including the RIBA, Bartlett School of Architecture, the South Africa Design Indaba conference and the Royal Academy. \nIn 2004 he curated an exhibition at the Design Museum consisting of 1,000 'every day' design objects that he had collected.\nKey works.\nThe \"B of the Bang\" was a \u00a31.42 million 56m-high sculpture of 180 giant spikes, erected outside the City of Manchester Stadium to celebrate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Safety problems happened soon after it was completed in 2004 when one spike came apart. Eventually 22 more were removed as a safety measure. The object was rewelded and fenced off. It continued to cause concern and debate over its future. Finally Manchester City Council took legal action against Heatherwick studio and their subcontractors, who in November 2008 agreed to pay \u00a31.7 million in damages. The installation was removed in 2009.\nThe 'East Beach Caf\u00e9' is a building on Littlehampton Sea Front, West Sussex, UK created by Heatherwick. Commissioned in 2005, the large steel structure houses a Caf\u00e9 by daytime and restaurant in the evening. The concept allowed the steel to rust and the colours to develop over time before being fixed in a transparent oil. It won the 2008 RIBA Award in the South East region.\nAwards.\nThomas Heatherwick was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Arts by Manchester Metropolitan University - his alma mater - on July 21, 2007. It is in recognition of his design work across a broad spectrum of architecture, engineering and public art, achieving national and international acclaim for his innovative use of materials, his eclectic range of projects, and the resolution of them in new and exciting ways."}

They are angled to allow light and air in. They also keep out rain, direct sunshine, and noise. The angle of the slats may be adjusted.\nLouvers come from the Middle Ages as lantern-like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes. They were put in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow. They were originally rather rough constructions consisting only of a barrel. Later they became more elaborate designs made of pottery. They took the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth. They also became more like modern louvers, with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string.\nMore modern louver windows are made of slats of glass, opened and closed with a metal lever. They may also be shutters of wood, plastic or other material.\nSome modern louver systems serve to improve indoor daylighting. Fixed mirrored louver systems can limit glare and of redirect diffuse light. Such louvers may be put in between two panes of double glazing.\nLouvers are rarely seen as primary design elements in the language of modern architecture. They are rather simply a technical device. However, there are examples of architects who use them as part of the overall aesthetic effect of their buildings. The most well-known example is Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto who would create aesthetic effects in the facades of his buildings through the combination of different types and sizes of louvers. Some are fixed and some are moveable. They are made mostly from wood (e.g. the various buildings of the Helsinki University of Technology). A second example, taking influence from Aalto, is the second-generation modernist architect Juha Leivisk\u00e4.\nAdditionally, louvers are used as semi-passive means of thermal control on spacecraft. They are also available as an accessory for some automobiles."}

In the final 18 TV episodes, the writers showed the fate of the remaining survivors, and explained the powers which the Island held in their lives. The sixth-season premiere was the first to climb in the ratings year-over-year since the second season, drawing 12.1 million viewers. The series finale aired on May 23, 2010. The final episode ran 2.5 hours starting at 9/8 CDT, pushing the late-night news back a half-hour. It was followed by the previously announced post-finale special, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live: Aloha to Lost\", at 12:05\u00a0a.m. (11:05 CDT). The season continued the stories of the survivors of the fictional September 22, 2004 crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, on an unknown island in the South Pacific. The survivors must deal with two outcomes of the explosion of a nuclear bomb on the island in the 1970s. While the on-island story continues, a set of \"flash sideways\" scenes show a second timeline, in which Flight 815 never crashes. The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 24, 2010, alongside a complete series boxset.\nFor a summary of the final season's storyline, see below: \"Season 6 plot summary\".\nProduction.\nOn May 7, 2007, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that \"Lost\" would end during the 2009\u20132010 season with a \"highly anticipated and shocking finale\". \"We felt that this was the only way to give \"Lost\" a proper creative conclusion,\" McPherson said. Beginning with the 2007\u20132008 television season, the final 48 episodes would have been aired as three seasons with 16 episodes each, with \"Lost\" concluding in its sixth season. Due to the 2007-2008 writers' strike, the fourth season featured 14 episodes, and season 5 had 17 episodes. Season six was planned to have 17 episodes, too. However, on June 29 it was announced that the final season would feature an additional hour, making the number of episodes 18.\nExecutive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse stated that they \"always envisioned \"Lost\" as a show with a beginning, middle, and end,\" and that by announcing when the show would end that viewers would \"have the security of knowing that the story will play out as we've intended.\" Lindelof and Cuse stated that securing the 2010 series-end date \"was immensely liberating\" and helped the series rediscover its focus. Lindelof noted, \"We're no longer stalling.\" The producers also planned to wrap up long-standing mysteries, such as the nature of the smoke monster, the reason the Dharma periodic resupply drops continue after the purge, and the \"bird\" from \"Exodus Pt. 2\" and \"Live Together, Die Alone Pt. 1\". While the destruction of the four-toed statue of Taweret was revealed in the ninth episode of the final season, Lindelof hinted that the identity of the statue's builders would not be addressed. The producer also indicated that Walt's unusual abilities may be explained, although not necessarily with the character's direct involvement. In a podcast, Cuse and Lindelof stated that they would explain the \"Rules\" first stated in an episode in season four, but only those that are \"important for the narrative they are telling.\" Matthew Fox said in an interview that in the final season, the characters of Jack Shephard and John Locke \"will come head to head.\" It was also claimed that a third of the way through the final season, the two timelines would be \"solidified into one\" and \"will be very linear \u2013 no more flashbacks, nothing;\" however this was still not the case by the season midpoint. He also claimed to be the only cast member to know the ending of the series, though Lindelof has clarified that Fox only knew things that were relevant to his character.\nDuring Comic-Con 2009, numerous sixth-season reports were made. Carlton Cuse stated both the time travel and flash-forward seasons were over, and they were moving into something different for the sixth season. Josh Holloway stated his character Sawyer would revert to his old self after the loss of Juliet. Though Cuse and Lindelof stated that the Dharma Initiative would no longer play a large role in the show, they have said that the \"Dharma-Michigan connection\" would play a significant role in season six. Lindelof stated that the producers had a direct hand in the production of the season six promotional poster that was first displayed at Comic-Con, and that everything in it was intentional; he also made a reference to the Abbey Road cover in connection to the poster. Season six was the first and only season of Lost ever to not feature any kind of preview or official promotional material such as sneak peeks and promo pictures for future episodes since the Lost producers considered any single frame from the first episodes to be too revealing. According to Lindelof, \"even a single scene from the show would basically tip what it is we're doing this year, and what it is we're doing this year is different than what we've done in other years.\" Lindelof has also emphasized that the flashes-sideways are important, stating \"People are saying [they] don't need these stories and all we can say is they're absolutely 100 percent necessary to tell the story of Lost, and hopefully by the end of the season it will be more obvious as to why.\" He also noted that the term \"flash-sideways\" was deliberately used instead of \"alternate reality\" because viewers might otherwise \"infer that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real.\" When asked to describe the last three episodes, Lindelof said \"Water.\" \nABC charged advertisers $900,000 USD for a 30-second commercial during the series finale, in contrast to the standard 2010 season price of $214,000.\nCast.\nThe cast features fifteen major roles with star billing: eleven return from the fifth season, one returns from the fourth season after a year's absence, and three are new regular cast members. Unlike the latter half of the previous season, in which the cast was divided into two groups following two separate storylines, Season Six features an alternate universe scenario which the producers call \"flash-sideways,\" and almost all the main characters participate in both storylines. Returning from the fifth season are the survivors' leader Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox); former fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly); millionaire Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia); former torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews); con artist James \"Sawyer\" Ford (Josh Holloway); medium Miles Straume (Ken Leung); former mob-enforcer Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and his privileged wife Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim); leader of the island's native population (known as the \"Others\") Ben Linus (Michael Emerson); and deceased crash survivor John Locke, who lives on in the sideways timeline but has been possessed in the original timeline by the mysterious Man In Black. Emilie de Ravin returns in her role as Claire Littleton, a new mother who was absent for one season after disappearing on the Island, and Henry Ian Cusick also returns as Desmond Hume, who starts the season off the Island. The new main cast roles go to pilot Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), an ageless advisor to the Others, and mysterious Flight 316 leader Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Carbonell was named a main cast member by the executive producers at Comic-Con 2009, after guest starring in the previous three seasons, and Fahey and Robinson were confirmed after appearing in recurring roles in the fourth and fifth seasons.\nSeveral former cast members are scheduled to return to the show, or have been asked back. Elizabeth Mitchell returns as fertility specialist Dr. Juliet Burke. Mitchell has stated that her return is \"instrumental to the story\". Dominic Monaghan returned as rock star Charlie Pace in four episodes. Jeremy Davies returned as physicist Daniel Faraday in multiple episodes. Ian Somerhalder also returned as Flight 815 crash survivor Boone Carlyle in several episodes. Rebecca Mader, who portrays anthropologist Charlotte Lewis, also returned. The producers have also confirmed that Harold Perrineau and Cynthia Watros, who portray Michael Dawson and Libby Smith, respectively, returned in the second half of the season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, \"Finally, all of your questions [about Libby] will be answered\", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, \"No, they will not\". Michelle Rodriguez, another second season star, returned as police officer Ana Lucia Cortez, following a brief cameo in the fifth season. Maggie Grace, who portrays Shannon Rutherford, Boone's stepsister, was asked to return at the beginning of the season, but Grace was unable due to her schedule; she appeared later in the season, instead. Furthermore, the producers wished to bring back the character of Walt Lloyd, however Malcolm David Kelley, who portrays Walt, has aged significantly and the producers are working to overcome this obstacle.\nRecurring characters who returned include: Jack and Claire's father, Dr. Christian Shephard (John Terry), wealthy industrialist and former Other Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's wife Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), former Other Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), Locke's ex-girlfriend, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), Hurley's former boss, Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion), mysterious Flight 316 passenger Bram (Brad William Henke), Sayid's wife, Nadia (Andrea Gabriel), deceased Frenchwoman Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), science teacher Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), the Others' doctor Ethan Rom (William Mapother), Ben Linus' father Roger (Jon Gries), mercenaries Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and Omar (Anthony Azizi), and Vincent, a dog who survived the crash of Flight 815 and lives on the island. Mark Pellegrino returns in his role as Jacob, the mysterious figure in charge of the island, while Titus Welliver also reprises his role as the mysterious unnamed character, known only as \"The Man in Black\", who appeared to be antagonistic to him in the season 5 finale. L. Scott Caldwell and Sam Anderson returned in their roles as Rose and Bernard respectively, as does Kimberley Joseph who plays 815 stewardess-turned-Other Cindy. Also, Academy Award-winner Fisher Stevens returns as communications officer George Minkowski from the first few episodes of the fourth season in the eleventh episode. Kevin Tighe returns as Anthony Cooper, Locke's father.\nSeveral new recurring characters were introduced in the sixth season. \"Deadwood\" actor John Hawkes was cast to portray a character named Lennon and Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada obtained the role of ; both men are Others stationed at the temple. Also, William Atherton was cast in a guest role as the principal of the school where Ben works. Sheila Kelley has been cast in a recurring role that was initially described as \"Kendall\" and later confirmed to be \"Zoe\".\nEpisodes.\nThe season premiered on February 2, 2010, with a double-length episode (two hours including commercials) preceded by a one-hour clip show, entitled \"Lost: Final Chapter\". The show continued from February 9 at its new timeslot of Tuesdays at 9\u00a0pm, with a total of 18 episodes airing in 16 broadcasts, ending with a two and a half hour, two-part series finale, the latter part of which aired Sunday, May 23, 2010. Additionally, the first hour of the premiere episode was screened to an estimated 15,000 fans on Waikiki Beach on January 30. In the following table, \"Series #\" refers to the episode's number in the overall series, whereas \"Season #\" refers to the episode's number in this particular season. \"U.S. viewers in millions\" refers to the number of Americans in millions who watched the episodes live or recorded them and watched them within seven days of broadcast.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSeason 6 plot summary.\nThe sixth season followed two timelines, each an outcome of the explosion of a hydrogen bomb in the previous season finale. In the first timeline (referred to as \"flash sideways\"), Oceanic Flight 815 never crashes but lands with all leaving the airplane at Los Angeles LAX airport. In the second timeline, the remaining survivors return to the present day (on the Island) and must deal with the demise of \"Jacob\", whose death has been caused by the mysterious Man in Black, the Smoke Monster. According to show producer Damon Lindelof, the term \"flash-sideways\" was deliberately used instead of \"alternate reality\" because it might then imply \"that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real.\"\nOn the island, it is revealed that, long long ago, infant \"Jacob\" and his brother were stolen, from their birth mother, by a woman who raised them to become protectors of the island, after her. At the hidden center of the island, is a waterfall cave containing a bright power source. \"Jacob\" (with blond hair) and his brother (with black hair, symbolizing white and black) grow up with opposing viewpoints. \"Jacob\" stays loyal to his adoptive mother, but his brother joins with outsiders on the island. When the brother reveals that they have dug into the core of the island, tapping an underground power to escape, the mother hits the brother with a rock, and she destroys the people in their village. She then chooses \"Jacob\" to drink the water of immortality. His brother awakens to see the burned village, and seeking revenge, he finds and kills his adoptive mother. \"Jacob\" discovers her dead body, and in turn, throws his brother into the waterfall cave, transforming him into the black Smoke Monster.\nNow centuries later, among the survivors, the Smoke Monster assumes the form of \"John Locke\", returned to the island in a coffin. This \"Locke\" had convinced \"Ben\" to enter the seaside cave and stab \"Jacob\", who fell into the fire and died. With many survivors believing that \"Locke\" has been resurrected, they follow him in various plans to leave the island. In one plan, they overthrow the guards at \"Widmore's\" submarine, and leave the island, unaware that a time bomb is inside the submarine. \"Jack\" (the doctor) discovers the time bomb, advising them not to disarm it while reasoning that the Smoke Monster cannot kill anyone directly. Instead, \"Sawyer\" (Ford) refuses to listen and pulls the bomb wires, which, instead, causes the bomb to count down faster. \"Sayid\" grabs the bomb and runs through the submarine, sacrificing himself to shield the others from the bomb blast. However, the bomb splits the submarine walls, and while sinking, \"Sun-Hwa\" is trapped in the wreckage, but \"Jin\" stays with her, vowing to never leave her side again, as they both die underwater.\n\"Jack\" swims, with a breathing tube, to the surface and back to shore. He tells the rest that \"Sun\" and \"Jin\" did not escape. In anger, \"Kate\" vows to kill \"John Locke\", for what he has done to their friends. \"Sayyid\" (the Iraqi guard), \"Richard\", and \"Miles\" (son of the DHARMA leader) go to the other island to destroy the airplane. However, crossing at sea, they find the pilot adrift, who convinces them to repair the airplane to escape later.\nThe spirit of \"Jacob\" asks who among them would become Protector of the island, and \"Jack\" volunteers. At the waterfall cave, \"Jack\" drinks the water of immortality and returns to the group. \"Jack\" says they must meet with \"Locke\" and \"Desmond\" to settle the dispute and kill \"Locke\". The 2 groups meet on the hilltop, and just the 3 proceed toward the waterfall cave. There, \"Desmond\" descends on a rope into the cave, but pulls a rock from the bottom, which puts out the light of the power source. The island begins a series of earthquake tremors, to fall into the sea, with rocks tumbling into the water. \"Locke\" flees the area, now needing to get the sailboat to the other island: he has lost his immortality when the light source was put out. \"Jack\" chases him to the sea cliffs to stop him from leaving, and a long fight begins. \"Locke\" grabs a knife and stabs \"Jack\" in the side, then forces the knife up to \"Jack's\" neck. Before plunging the knife, a gunshot is heard: \"Kate\" as promised, has shot \"Locke\" (the Smoke Monster) in the back, and \"Jack\" pushes him off the sea cliff, to die on the rocks below.\n\"Jack\" tells them he must return to the island core, as he promised Jacob, to restore the light at the waterfall cave. He instructs \"Kate\" to leave with \"Sawyer\" to get \"Claire\" into the airplane on the other island. \"Kate\" in turmoil kisses \"Jack\" goodbye, fearing it will be the last time. \"Kate\" and \"Sawyer\" jump into the sea and swim to the sailboat at anchor.\n\"Hurley\" and \"Ben\" help \"Jack\" return to the waterfall cave. They lower \"Jack\" into the cave, where he revives and ties \"Desmond\" to the rope. \"Jack\" then puts the missing stone back into the floor, and restarts the light power source. When \"Hurley\" and \"Ben\" pull the rope, they find only \"Desmond\". They call below, but \"Jack\", overcome by the knife wound and rushing water, never answered, so they take \"Desmond\" away from the area. Some time later, Jack awakens, alone, outside the cave, as if lifted from the depth of the cave by an unseen force. Dazed, he wanders through the jungle, but he is losing strength. Just as with \"Locke's\" death, \"Jack\" also lost his immortality, and protection, at the first time the light source was put out. \"Jack\" falls to the ground, looking up to the blue sky. At that point, he sees \"Kate's\" plane flying far overhead, and then closes his eyes, for the last time.\nMeanwhile, in the \"flash-sideways\" view of events, everyone has returned on Oceanic Flight 815, and all have resumed their original lives:\nSoon after returning on Flight 815, \"Desmond\" has been tasked to ensure that bandmember \"Charlie\" stays sober to appear at a benefit concert for Charles Widmore. \"Charlie\" keeps talking about some imaginary, profound romance with a blonde girl, as if in some dream. Trying to rebel against \"Desmond\", he grabs the steering wheel, and the car goes into the harbor. Underwater, looking back inside the car to save \"Charlie\", he remembers seeing \"\" written on \"Charlie's\" hand, but not actually, then pulls him to the surface. They get rescued to the hospital, and Desmond asks, \"Who is Penny?\". Some memories come back, and Desmond begins to orchestrate a plan: at the school, he hits \"John Locke\" with his car, causing him to need surgery, led by \"Jack Shephard\" at the hospital. \"Desmond\" turns himself in to the police station for \"Sawyer\", who puts him in a jail cell near \"Kate\" and \"Sayid\".\nMeanwhile, \"Hurley\" has been hired to free \"Kate\", \"Sayid\" and \"Desmond\" by paying Officer \"Ana Lucia\" to detour the prison van to the harbor. They get in 2 cars, and make plans to attend the benefit concert. \"Desmond\" and \"Kate\" drive to the church, where \"Desmond\" meets the funeral van, to accept the casket of \"Christian Shephard\" (\"Jack's\" father) into the chapel. This same day, \"John Locke\" has a 2nd spinal surgery, by \"Jack\", and regains feeling in his legs. Coming to the hospital to visit \"Sun-Hwa\", the police officer \"Sawyer (Ford)\" meets \"Juliet\" at the snack machines, where they both suddenly remember their parallel life, 3 years together on the island.\nNow nighttime, \"Hurley\" drives \"Sayid\" to a backstreet, saying that he knows he is really a good guy: a fight breaks out in the alley, and a girl shouts, \"Don't hurt my brother!\" \"Sayid\", instinctively, jumps out to rescue her. When he sees her face, he remembers her: \"Shannon?\" Her stepbrother, \"Boone\" goes to the van and tells \"Hurley\", he is glad \"Sayid\" finally arrived because he was getting tired of staging the alley fight for them. \"Desmond\" attends the concert, where \"Daniel Faraday's\" mother talks to \"Desmond\" about the secret plan. While performing on stage, \"Charlie\" recognizes \"Claire\" in the audience, as the girl of his dreams, when she leaves to give birth to her son, assisted by \"Kate\" to get to the hospital.\nFinally, \"Kate\" has convinced \"Jack\" (only partially aware of his parallel memories) to drive to the church, intended for his father's funeral. There, he enters the chapel, and upon touching his father's casket, he too begins to remember \"everything\" from the Island, all of them, including his years spent with \"Kate\". However, upon opening the casket, he finds it empty: his father has assumed a spirit form, and reminds him that he, too, died on the island, in his other life, which was as real as the present day. They both enter the church, where all the former islanders have gathered: \"Sun\" with \"Jin\"; \"Sawyer\" with \"Juliet\"; \"Sayid\" with \"Shannon\"; \"Rose\" with \"Bernard\"; \"Hurley\" with \"Libby\" (etc.). Even \"Desmond\" and \"Penny\" are together there, remembering their parallel life and birth of their child. Everyone who recently landed with Oceanic Flight 815, now greet and hug each other as if old friends, remembering how, once, they all were \"lost\" but now they have found each other."}

Weather maps have been used from the mid-19th century, for study and for weather forecasting. Some maps show differences of temperature, and weather fronts. \nA station model is a symbolic picture showing the weather at a reporting station. Meteorologists made the station model to put down many weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps thickly filled with station-model plots can be hard to read. However, they help meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for every place of observation. The station model is mostly used for surface-weather maps. It can also be used to show the weather in the sky, though. A complete station-model map lets people study patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.\nHistory.\nPeople first began using weather charts in a modern way in the mid-19th century. They began using them to make a theory about storm systems. When a telegraph network developed by 1845, it was possible for people to collect information about the weather. They could get the information from many different places far away quickly enough for the information to be useful. In the 1840s, Joseph Henry took charge. He helped the Smithsonian Institution focus most of its observers on the center and the eastern part of the United States during the 1840s and 1860s. The U.S. Army Signal Corps kept up this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress. It later expanded to the Western United States.\nAt first, all the data on the map was not taken from these analyses. This was because there was not enough time standardization. People first tried to standardize time in Great Britain in 1855. The entire United States was not influenced by time zones (areas with different times) until 1906. This was when Detroit had made the standard time at last. Over all the earth, other countries began taking weather observations at the same time. This started in 1873."}

He has consistently ranked among the world's top players since the early 1990s, and reached a ranking as high as number four in 1998. Shirov is also a well-regarded chess author.\nCareer.\nShirov became the World Champion (under 16) in 1988, and achieved the title of grandmaster in 1990. He is the winner of numerous international tournaments.\nIn 1998 Shirov's ranking rose to number four in the world. On the basis of his rating, he was invited to play a ten-game match against Vladimir Kramnik to select a challenger for World Champion Garry Kasparov. Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when funds could not be raised. When Kasparov played Kramnik for the world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger.\nIn 2000, Shirov reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship, losing to Viswanathan Anand.\nIn May/June 2007 he played in the Candidates Tournament of the FIDE World Chess Championship. He won his first round match against Michael Adams (+1-1=4, won in rapid playoff), but was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Levon Aronian (+0-1=5). In November/December 2007 Shirov played in the Chess World Cup. He lost in the final 2.5-1.5 to Gata Kamsky.\nIn May 2009, Alexei Shirov achieved the greatest triumph of his career by placing 1st in the high Category 21\u00a0M-Tel Masters 2009 tournament, a double round tournament held in Sofia, Bulgaria. He was undefeated, and scored 6.5/10\u2014seven draws and three victories, two against Vassily Ivanchuk and the other against Magnus Carlsen in the final round. By this success he was given entry to the Grand Slam Chess Final 2009 in Bilbao where he met Levon Aronian, Sergey Karjakin (winner of Corus 2009), and Alexander Grischuk (winner of Linares 2009).\nPersonal life.\nIn 1994 Shirov married, and later divorced, Ver\u00f3nica Alvarez, moved to Tarragona, and became a citizen of Spain. He married, then later divorced, Lithuanian IM/WGM Viktorija \u010cmilyt\u0117 from 2001 to 2008. Although he still plays for Spain, he now lives in Latvia.\nPlaying style.\nShirov is noted for his attacking style and for seeking complications, a tendency which has led to comparisons with fellow Latvian and former world champion, Mikhail Tal, under whom he studied in his youth.\nSample game.\nDuring the 1998 Linares chess tournament Shirov played black against future FIDE world champion Veselin Topalov and won with a piece sacrifice in a bishop and pawn ending.\n1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7 7.Bb5+ c6 8.Ba4 O-O 9.Ne2 Nd7 10.O-O e5 11.f3 Qe7 12.Be3 Rd8 13.Qc2 Nb6 14.Bb3 Be6 15.Rad1 Nc4 16.Bc1 b5 17.f4 exd4 18.Nxd4 Bg4 19.Rde1 Qc5 20.Kh1 a5 21.h3 Bd7 22.a4 bxa4 23.Ba2 Be8 24.e5 Nb6 25.f5 Nd5 26.Bd2 Nb4 27.Qxa4 Nxa2 28.Qxa2 Bxe5 29.fxg6 hxg6 30.Bg5 Rd5 31.Re3 Qd6 32.Qe2 Bd7 33.c4 Bxd4 34.cxd5 Bxe3 35.Qxe3 Re8 36.Qc3 Qxd5 37.Bh6 Re5 38.Rf3 Qc5 39.Qa1 Bf5 40.Re3 f6 41.Rxe5 Qxe5 42.Qa2+ Qd5 43.Qxd5+ cxd5 44.Bd2 a4 45.Bc3 Kf7 46.h4 Ke6 47.Kg1 Bh3!!

Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea.\nLactase evolution in humans.\nHumans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism.\nThe ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk. \nHunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers. \nGenetics.\nA mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives.\nThis appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait. \nGenetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene\u2013culture coevolution."}

The network is financially backed by the National Basketball Association (NBA), which also uses NBA TV as a way of advertising their out of market package NBA League Pass, and partner channel TNT.\nEarly years.\nStarted in 1999 as nba.com TV, the channel, which had its studios at NBA Entertainment in Secaucus, New Jersey, began a multi-year deal with American television companies Cox Communications, Cablevision, and Time Warner on June 28, 2003, allowing the network to expand to 45 million American homes, and 30 different countries. NBA TV replaced Time Warner's CNN/SI on many cable systems after that network shut down a year earlier.\nProgramming.\nNBA TV offers basketball news every day, as well as programming showcasing basketball players' individual lifestyles, life as a basketball team during an NBA season, famous games of the past, and live games typically four days a week during the NBA season. Live games on NBA TV are subject to local blackout restrictions, since NBA TV does not have exclusive broadcast rights to any of its games. Games carried by NBA TV are always also carried by each team's local rights holder.\nThe channel also shows international games, typically on Saturday evenings, with special emphasis on the Euroleague and the Maccabi Tel Aviv team from Israel. In April 2005, the channel televised the Chinese Basketball Association finals for the first time.\nNBA TV carries at least 90 regular-season games per season, all broadcast in high definition, as well as some first-round playoff games. It also broadcasts WNBA games nationally (subject to local blackout).\nThe channel's flagship program is \"NBA Gametime Live\", a show in which a host and studio analysts go over the latest news, highlights, and look in at games in progress. The show is live six days a week, not airing on most Thursdays due to NBA's coverage of \"The NBA on TNT\". An edited one hour/thirty minute version of the broadcast is repeated throughout the late night/early morning hours.\nPersonalities.\nThe studio host and analysts vary every night on NBA Gametime Live.\nOwnership.\nOn October 8, 2007, it was reported that Turner Sports, a division of Time Warner, was to take over the channel's operations, according to\nHoopsworld:\n\"NBATV: Surprisingly there has been little said about the NBA's decision to sell off NBATV to one of its media partners. Talks had gone on for as ESPN/ABC and Turner both explored scenarios with the league. Ultimately it seems Turner has won out, and will take over operation of the league's flagship cable channel, that reaches some 12 million subscribers. The exact changeover date is not clear, but several months ago a Bloomberg report cited sources saying senior level producers were offered contract buyouts in September.\"\nTurner Sports relaunched the channel on October 28, 2008, using analysts carried over from NBA on TNT.\n The studio was also upgraded, and the show now airs live from Studio B at Turner Studios in Atlanta, Georgia; Studio B is adjacent to Studio J, home of Inside the NBA.\nInternational presence.\nIn 2001, Raptors NBA TV begin airing in Canada. Although quite similar to NBA TV, there is a larger focus on the Toronto Raptors basketball team, due to Canadian content requirements and restrictions on foreign ownership (the channel is owned by Raptors parent company Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, not the league).\nAs of 2010, NBA TV coverage can be seen in 40 countries via the following partners:\nNBA TV HD.\nNBA TV HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast of NBA TV. All studio programs and original shows are shot in HD, and all live games and recent game rebroadcasts are shown in HD. For programs not available in HD (such as older game footage), unique stylized pillarboxes are used, the NBA logo with \"NBA TV\" under it, or alternately, just \"NBA TV\" sideways. Both are in black and gray\nNew carriage agreements.\nOn April 16, 2009, it was announced that DirecTV and the NBA reached a new carriage agreement. NBA TV was moved from the satellite television provider's add-on Sports Pack (and premium subscription package NBA League Pass) to its lower priced base package Choice Xtra on October 1, 2009. DirecTV believes the move will make the channel available to an additional 8 million subscribers.\nOn June 4, 2009, it was announced that the NBA and Comcast have reached a deal to move the channel from the cable company's add-on Sports Entertainment Package to its basic level Digital Classic package, by the start of the 2009-10 NBA season. Comcast believes an additional 8 million customers will now have access to the channel.\nVerizon FiOS added the channel and NBA League Pass for the first time on September 23, 2009.\nThe channel also signed new multiyear agreements with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Dish Network on October 22, 2009. They also reached a new deal with Cox Cable earlier this year.\nWith all of the above carriage deals, the NBA believes it will now reach 45 million viewers."}

There is no definition of a gifted student which everyone agrees on.\nGifted and talented education has a long history of thousands of years. Plato (c. 427\u2013c. 347 BCE) was in favour of providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women. In China's Tang Dynasty (580-618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who showed creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage.\nIn 2011, the National Association for Gifted Children published a position paper that stated what a gifted student is. The word \"gifted,\" describes people who demonstrate outstanding aptitude or competence in one or more domains. An \"aptitude\" is defined as an exceptional ability to learn or reason. \"Competence\" is defined as documented performance or achievement in the top 10 percent of the population."}

They are James Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitars), Nicky Wire (bass, occasional vocals) and Sean Moore (drums, backing vocals, occasional trumpet). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. Their biggest success was during the 1990s.\nThe band were originally a four piece band: lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 February 1995. In November 2008, 13 years after his disappearance, he was officially declared presumed dead.\nThe Manics released their debut album \"Generation Terrorists\" in 1992. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery, outspoken\ninvective and songs about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums kept a politicized and smart lyrical style. They also adopted a broader alternative rock sound. Enigmatic lyricist Richey Edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words \"4 REAL\" into his arm with a razor blade (narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic. The dark nature of 1994's \"The Holy Bible\" showed the result of Edwards' instability.\nFollowing Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore, and Wire kept with the Manic Street Preachers and went on to gain critical and commercial success. They became one of Britain's top rock bands. They have had eight top ten albums and fifteen top ten singles. They have reached number one three times, with their 1998 album \"This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours\" and the singles \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" (1998) and \"The Masses Against The Classes\" (2000). They have also won the Best British Album and Best British Group accolades at the BRIT Awards in 1997 and 1999, and were lauded by the NME for their lifetime achievements in 2008. Their ninth studio album, \"Journal For Plague Lovers\", was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics Edwards had left behind to the band weeks before his disappearance.\nIn 2010 their tenth album \"Postcards from a Young Man\" was released. Their eleventh album \"Rewind the Film\" was released on 16 September 2013. Their next album \"Futurology\" is going to be released in 2014."}

This was stopped by the UK government soon after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\nHistory.\nThe Gambling Act 2005 revised many regulations relating to gambling in England. Amongst the most controversial provisions was the establishment of a number of 'destination casinos' in the style of Las Vegas, commonly referred to in the media as 'Super Casinos'\nInitial drafts of the act proposed eight regional casinos but concerns expressed in the national media and by a range of addiction related social and religious groups meant that the final revision of the act permitted only one casino of the largest size, referred to as a 'Regional Casino', with a further eight 'large' and eight 'small' casinos of a smaller sizes and with reduced Jackpot limits.\nPrior to the act there were 140 casinos in the UK, the largest of which in Star City, Birmingham had a floor area of around 950 square metres. Customers were required to register twenty-four hours prior to gaming.\nDefinition of casino types.\nUnder the terms of the Gambling Act the Secretary of State is able to define each type of Casino, with reference to any matter he or she chooses; although the act specifically mentions as facts to consider the number, location and concentration of gaming tables, and the floor area designated for a specific purpose.\nDefinitions have been determined such that the 'super casino' will have a minimum customer area of 5000 square metres and at most 1250 unlimited-jackpot slot machines.\n'Large casinos' will have a minimum area of 1000 square metres and up to 150 slot machines with a maximum jackpot of \u00a34000.\nThe 'small casinos' will have a minimum customer area of 750 sq metres, up to 80 slot machines and a jackpot of \u00a34000.\nThe shortlist.\nIn May 2006, a short-list of eight sites, selected from various ones submitted by local councils, was announced for the location of the Regional Casino.

The main race is the Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle East. In 2006, Australian V8 Supercar started racing at the BIC. 24 Hour endurance races also hosted at BIC.\nHistory.\nBuilding the Bahrain circuit (track) was important for Bahrain, and was started by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation.\nIn the track became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished (important) FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award. The award was given for having and keeping high race safety and medical facilities.\nConstruction and design.\nThe track was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke. Tilke also designed the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. The track cost approximately US $150 million to build. It can be set-up as six different tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip.\nThe track had a special problem. The track was located in the middle of a desert. There were concerns that sand would blow onto the track and disrupt the race. Organizers (the people who run the race) were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive (glue) on the sand around the track.\nThe surface of the track has a high level of grip. The same surface is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\nSeries hosted.\nThe Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of races, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the Australian V8 Supercar Championship Series, the GP2 Series, GP2 Asia, Chevrolet Lumina Series, Speedcar Series, Thunder Arabia and Radical.\nIn the past the track has hosted the FIA GT Championship, and a one-time Bahrain Superprix involving Formula Three cars, following from the failure of the Korea Super Prix. The first Formula BMW World Final took place in Bahrain. Every year there is the 24 Hours of Bahrain race.\nBahrain Grand Prix.\nThe first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on 4 April 2004, making history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East. Other countries, including Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates wanted to host the Formula One Grand Prix.\nThe Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One schedule. In the 2006 season, Bahrain traded places with the usual first race, the Australian Grand Prix. The Australian Grand Prix date was changed to avoid interfering with the Commonwealth Games. In , Bahrain was moved to the fourth race on the schedule. In , Bahrain was the first race of the season. For 2010, the Formula One cars raced on the full \"Endurance Circuit\".\nStarting in 2011, Formula One will return to the original track layout. This is the layout that was used in 2004."}

If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as for pumping water, cutting lumber or grinding stones, the machine is called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity, the machine may be called a wind turbine generator (WTG), wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator.\nTurning the generator.\nThe wind turbine's blades are turned by the wind. This turns a shaft turning slowly, at about 10-20 rpm with a high torque. The shaft goes into a reduction gearbox with a ratio of about 1:50, although some wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more. Some wind turbines may have no reduction gearbox at all, and have a ratio of 1:1. The gearbox turns the generator more quickly, at around 1000 rpm, at a low torque. The generator creates electricity. This electricity is combined with any other wind turbines that may be in the same wind farm. This combined electricity may be used locally, or adjusted to match the electricity in the power grid and sent to the power grid.\nEnvironmental Impact.\nAlthough wind turbines are a renewable source of energy and don't pollute the environment as a result of generating power, they have an environmental impact. Some people think that wind turbines create a lot of noise and look unappealing. However, wind turbines are placed no closer than 300 meters from residential homes. At that distance, a wind turbine is no louder than an average household air conditioner."}

The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war.\nAt that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war. The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead.\n\"Funeral Oration\" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his \"History of the Peloponnesian War\". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his \"History\" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech.\nThe Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as \"a eulogy (description) of Athens itself...\". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people.\nGettysburg Address and Pericles' funeral oration.\nAmerican Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration."}
