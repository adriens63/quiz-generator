George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other officers in the Continental Army helped. Von Steuben rewrote the book a year later.\nAt Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-1778, Acting Inspector General von Steuben saw that many Continental officers gave their men different drills. Drills are practice exercises. Using different drills meant the men might become confused in a real battle. Von Steuben wrote new drills for the whole army. He wrote them French. His aide-de-camp, Pierre Ettienne Duponceau, and George Washington's aides-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton and John Laurens rewrote them in English. General George Washington would read the drills and make changes. They gave each lesson to the officers one at a time. Then the officers or their helpers made their own copies. Then van Steuben and the officers would use the drills with the men.\nThe next year, in Philadelphia, von Steuben wrote down his Valley Forge drills in one book. He wrote it in French. Lieutenant Colonel Francois de Fleury helped. Then Captain Benjamin Walker and Duponceu rewrote the book in English.

Joe Biden won the state in November. Trump has refused to accept the presidential election. \nTrump's call with Raffensperger was first reported by \"The Washington Post\" and other media outlets the day after it took place.\nAt one point on the call, Trump told Raffensperger, \"What I want to do this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.\" Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes, so 11,780 votes would be 1 vote more for him.\nMany believe that Trump should be criminally investigated and impeached. Many Republicans and Democrats criticized Trump's phone call.\nBackground.\nPresidential Elections in the United States.\nElectoral College.\nIn the United States, the winner of a presidential election is not the person with the most votes. Instead, it is the person who wins the most votes in the electoral college. In this process, a group of people called electors vote for president. Each state has a certain number of electors depending on how many people live there. There are 538 electors in all. For a person to become president, he or she must get 270 or more votes from the electors.\nWhen a presidential candidate wins the most votes in a state, all of those state's electoral votes go to that person.\nStates.\nElections are done by each state, which means there were 50 different elections going on at the same time. Each state has its own rules about who is allowed to vote.\nThe Secretary of State is in charge of each state's elections.\nGeorgia.\nGeorgia has 16 electoral votes. That means that it makes 16 people electors. Biden got the most votes in Georgia so all 16 electoral votes went to him. A lot of people were surprised because Trump got the most votes in Georgia in 2016. Usually, Republican candidates have gotten the most votes in Georgia.\nBrad Raffensperger was elected Secretary of State in 2018. He and Trump are both members of the Republican Party.\nReactions and Lawsuits.\nTrump was not very happy about Georgia's electoral votes going to Biden. He said that there was cheating in the Georgia elections and that votes were changed so that Biden would get more. He said government officials in Georgia allowed electoral fraud and made him lose. He asked them to count the votes again. They did, but Biden still got the most votes.\nCall.\nOn January 2, 2021, Trump called Raffensperger. He said that he won Georgia by \"hundreds of thousands of votes\" and that the results were wrong. Neither of these are true. Then he asked Raffensperger to \"find\" 11,780 votes and add them to the results so that he could be the winner.\nInvestigation.\nAccording to federal and state law, trying to change the results of an election and making someone do so are illegal. That means that Trump might have broken the law by trying to make Raffensperger change the results of the elections in Georgia."}

Ethnographers study specific cultures.\nEthnography mostly uses participant observation. The researcher becomes part of the setting or mixes with the people being studied. They try to record patterns of social interaction and the thoughts and experiences of participants. Ethnographers want to understand these in their local contexts. Ethnography started in social and cultural anthropology in the early twentieth century. It spread to other social sciences, especially sociology.\nEthnographers mainly use qualitative methods. They may also use quantitative data. \nAccording to Dewan (2018), ethnographers do not try to find generalized results. They study cultures in context and in a specific situation. The best way to use ethnography with quantitative research is to discover relationships. Then, use the results and data to test and explain empirical assumptions.\nThe word ethnography comes from Greek words \"ethnos\" \"folk, people, nation\" and \"grapho\" \"I write\")"}

However, Burns learns that the town will lose $50 million every three months because of the machines. Burns must fire some of his employees at the power plant. Homer is sad because Musk's machines made his friends fired. On the next day, Burns tries to assassinate Elon. Elon stops a bullet from hitting him or hitting Homer.

Instead, the products of their labor are exchanged for wages in order to survive.\nTypes of Alienation.\nAlienation from the product of a person's work.\nIn this type of alienation, a worker cannot relate to the work he or she is doing. For example, someone can screw parts into a toy without seeing the rest of the toy when it is done. This type of alienation increased after people started doing work in assembly lines. Before then, people would make things from start to finish.\nAlienation from the process of work.\nA worker does not control the means of production. He or she just does the things that is taught to them. For example, a worker might need to make shirts in the same style and cannot experiment with patterns or designs.\nAlienation from others.\nIn a capitalist society, a worker will be in competition with other workers for a small number of jobs. Because of this, they cannot cooperate with each other and fight for their shared interests as workers.\nAlienation from self.\nFinally, people are alienated from their identity that they get from doing their work. Marx called this identity \"Gattungswesen\" (German for \"species-essence\" or \"human nature\"). For example, someone who just screws parts into a toy will not feel like a toymaker because he or she is not really \"making\" toys."}

She was the younger sister of birth control activist Margaret Sanger, and assisted her in this work.\nBackground.\nMichael Hennessey Higgins and Anne Higgins had a family with eleven children. They had an Irish American background. Ethel and Margaret were two of the children. Her mother preferred Ethel. Margaret did not like this, and it caused problems in their relationship..\nEthel had a short and unhappy marriage to Jack Byrne, a glassworker. They had two children, Jack and Olive. In 1906, Ethel left her children in the care of their paternal grandparents to protect them from their abusive father; Ethel only visited her daughter once in sixteen years. Olive grew up to become an important muse to the creator of Wonder Woman, William Moulton Marston, and more details of Ethel Byrne's life came to light when Jill Lepore wrote about the superheroine character in 2014.\nEthel Byrne's background in nursing was very important to her activism. It directly contributed to her desire to make birth control accessible to women of varying backgrounds. She was a trained nurse who assisted immigrant women who needed medical care in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn, New York in 1916.\nBirth control activism.\nThe two sisters and theatre artist Fania Mindell opened a birth control clinic in Brooklyn in October 1916. They made flyers in different languages, including English, Yiddish and Italian,to advertise their cliniic. Byrne is not widely known today. Despite this, her early activism had a big impact on raising awareness of the importance of access to information about birth control. When Ethel Byrne was arrested, a group of politically active New York women wanted to meet President Woodrow Wilson. They wanted Wilson to undo laws that made distributing bith control a crime. \nArrest and hunger strike.\nThe clinic was highly controversial because the Comstock Laws were enforced. Byrne and Sanger distributed pessaries and would show their clients how to use this method of contraception in direct violation of these laws.\nThis was the first birth control clinic in the United States. The clinic caused an immediate sensation in the press. It got national attention, and all three women were arrested and tried for \"distributing obscene materials\".\nAll three women were found guilty. After some time, the verdicts were overturned, and their campaign was successful in the end. This caused major changes in social policy and to the laws governing birth control and sex education around the world. The clinic closed but later became the basis for what was to become known as Planned Parenthood.\nByrn was arrested for distributing information about bith control. She was sentenced to 30 days in Blackwell's Island prison. She was jailed at Blackwell Island workhouse on January 22, 1917 for her activism and subsequently went on a hunger strike. Sanger was concerned her sister would die as a result of this hunger strike and Byrne was force fed while serving her sentence after 185 hours without food or water. As historian Jill Lepore reports in \"The Secret History of Wonder Woman,\" Ethel Byrne was the first female political prisoner in the United States to be subjected to force feeding. Mrs. Byrne was prepared to starve herself to death in support of her cause. Her case was the first of a group of cases known as the \"Sanger cases\" to be brought to trial.\nSanger supported Byrne's activism. Their confinement helped bring national attention to their push for the legalization of birth control. It also hurt their relationship as Sanger's notoriety grew after this arrest and she was sometimes known to take credit for Ethel's infamous hunger strike.\nLater years.\nAlthough her sister went on to become world-famous for her advocacy of birth control, Byrne's legacy is not well known. This is apparent on the Planned Parenthood website, as it is noted Sanger opened her 1916 clinic with \"her sister\". Ethel is not even mentioned by name and unlike her older sister is not well known\nEthel Byrne had a stroke and died in 1955. She did not live to see the legalization of the birth control pill, as she died five years before it received FDA approval."}

Primitive means in the early stages of development, so primitive communism is an early form of communism.\nTraits.\nIn a primitive communist society, there is no extra stuff for people to hoard. Instead, things like food and housing are shared equally among all members of the community. There was no such thing as money. Also, everyone in a primitive communist society had to help get food. There was no authoritarianism and no concept of a state. Instead, everyone has an equal say in what goes on in the society. This is called egalitarianism.\nAgriculture led to the creation of the private ownership of land. The extra food that could be grown meant that some people didn't have to work to get food. These people started to get other jobs and that led to the creation of social class. This is when people started thinking that some jobs were more important than others and when slavery became a thing.\nMarxism.\nMarx and Engels got the idea of primitive communism from an American man named Lewis H. Morgan. Morgan did a lot of research on the Iroquois people, who lived in big groups and shared everything that they grew, hunted, and gathered. Marx and Engels thought that the Iroquois lived in a society that had communist traits."}

It was first shown on the Fox network on January 11, 2015. In the episode, Homer gets hypnotized and now thinks he is a child.\nStory.\nHomer learns that there is a man at the power plant he works at that does everything that Homer is suppose to do. The man is now retiring and Homer will have to work harder. At his house, he works for a very long time. Marge gets worried that he is working too hard, so she takes the family to a circus. At the circus, the family goes to a hypnotist. The hypnotist makes Homer think that he is 10 years old. Chief Wiggum then tells everyone that the hypnotist is a criminal. At a hospital, Dr. Hibbert tells them that if Homer wants to think right again, they will have to go to the same hypnotist.\nHomer now lives in Bart's room. Homer tells Bart that he does not want a job or a family when he gets older. Homer becomes Bart's best friend. Marge starts knitting because she is sad that Homer thinks he is a child. However, Homer does many fun activities with Bart and Lisa. Homer and Bart then go to an amusement park. Chief Wiggum has found the hypnotist and brings him and Marge to the park. Marge asks the hypnotist to make Homer show more affection to her. The hypnotist makes Homer back to thinking like an adult again. Homer does not know what happened to him and believes that he was very drunk. At night, Homer tries to tell Bart about the events with him. Homer does not remember that Bart is the person he is talking about. Marge thanks the hypnotist after Homer shows her more affection in bed.\nProduction.\n\"Bart's New Friend\" was written by Judd Apatow. Bob Anderson is the director of the episode. Apatow wrote the episode in 1990, 25 years before it was shown on television. The episode first started as a spec script (a screenplay that was not asked for by the show). He wrote spec scripts for many other shows. He gave his script to the writers of \"The Simpsons\", but they did not want it at the time. 25 years later, Al Jean (the executive producer) said to Apatow \"Hey, we'll make it now!\"\nAfter the end credits, a picture of Maggie Simpson holding a flag is shown. The flag says \"Je suis Charlie\". This picture was made to remember the people who died in the Charlie Hebdo shooting.\nReception.\n4.28 million people watched the episode when it was first shown on television. Dennis Perkins from \"The A.V. Club\" said that the episode shows that there is \"no end\" for stories about the family's relationships. Jesse Schedeen from IGN said that the episode is a \"perfectly decent new chapter of the show\" but thought that the episode was not like the episodes from 1990 that Apatow had seen. Dan Castellaneta is the voice actor for Homer. He was nominated for an award at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards for his voice acting of Homer in the episode."}

They went in to support Trump's demand for Vice President Mike Pence and Congress to reject President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The protests soon became riots as thousands of Trump supporters broke into the United States Capitol, damaging the building. The presidential historian Michael Beschloss called the attacks an attempted coup d'etat by the President. The attack of the United States Capitol building was the worst at that location since the War of 1812. \nRally.\nFirst occurred a planned rally on the Ellipse. There, Rudy Giuliani called for \"trial by combat\", while Donald Trump told his supporters to march to the United States Capitol \"to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today\", while also asking them to \"show strength\" and to \"fight like hell\" for Republicans to \"take back our country\".\nStorming of the Capitol.\nThe supporters broke into the Capitol. Congress was in session at the time and all congressmen, news reporters and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated to a secure location.\nA Trump-supporting female rioter was shot by Capitol Police during the storming, when she climbed through a barricaded door near the entrance to the hall for the House of Representatives; she died later that day. Three people also died from medical emergencies that day, said the Washington D.C. police. The New York Times said that attackers beat a police officer to death with a fire extinguisher, but that was later proven false.\nThe attack on the Capitol has been seen and called as domestic terrorism.\nDuring the attack, several rioters carried Confederate battle flags or Nazi symbols. For the first time in U.S. history, a Confederate battle flag was displayed inside the U.S. Capitol building.\nAftermath.\n5 people died during or shortly after the event: four rioters and one police officer. Fifteen police officers were sent to hospital, and more than 50 injured. Members of the mob hit Capitol Police officers in the head with lead pipes and other weapons, including flag poles. Howard Liebengood was a Capitol Police officer on duty during the attack. He died by suicide three days later. Jeffrey Smith defended the capitol as part of the Metro Police Department. He killed himself soon after.\nReactions.\nTrump was impeached for a second time because of what happened. Some people even wanted Vice President Pence to use the twenty-fifth amendment to remove Trump from office.\nTrump responded to the storming by releasing messages on Twitter. In a video, he told protesters: \"This was a fraudulent election, but we can\u2019t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You\u2019re very special. You\u2019ve seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.\" In another message, he wrote: \"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &amp; unfairly treated for so long\". He continued: \"Go home with love &amp; in peace. Remember this day forever!\".\nPrison sentence for protesters.\n\"More than 535 people have been charged with [or are under indictment for] taking part in the attack\", media said in July.\nOn July 20, 2021, one protester was sentenced to 8 months in prison; the trial was held in federal court.\nOne protester was sentenced to 3 years and 5 months in prison; Jake Angeli also got a 3 years 5 months sentence."}

It was first shown on the Fox network on January 4, 2015. The episode is about the Simpson family being taken to a planet of alien life.\nStory.\nThe Simpson family goes to an amusement park. They go inside of a ride that turns into a spaceship. They do not know that they are being taken to outer space. Two aliens named Kang and Kodos tell the family that they are going to their alien planet. Once they get there, Kang and Kodos put the Simpson family in a cage as prisoners. They get put inside of a zoo. They are told that one person in the family will be eaten for a ritual. They choose Homer Simpson to be the one eaten.\nHomer is seen with bacon on him in the ritual. Some aliens (that act like hippies) get Homer and say that aliens should not eat other species. Homer is safe, but he learns that everyone else in the family will be eaten instead. Homer goes back and is part of the ritual again. The queen of the planet starts to eat Homer. However, she gets poisoned because the family eats many junk food. The queen dies from the poison. They are put on a spaceship to go back to Earth. However, the family goes away from the Earth so that they do not have to talk to Grampa Simpson.\nProduction.\n\"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\" was written by Al Jean and David Mirkin. David Silverman is the director of the episode. The episode was first going to be the last episode of the 24th season. The episode \"Dangers on a Train\" was shown as the last episode of the season instead. Al Jean said that this was because the episode's story was thought of being made into a movie. This would be a sequel to \"The Simpsons Movie\". Back in 1992, the episode \"Kamp Krusty\" was also thought of being made as a movie. Jean said that people who watched the episode would see why it was not made as a movie. Jean was also worried that fans of the show would think that the story is not canon (events that are part of the show's story). He thought that this would be controversial with fans.\nReception.\n10.62 million people watched the episode when it was first shown on television. Dennis Perkins of \"The A.V. Club\" did not like the episode's strange ideas. He said that the episode is a \"product\" of \"breezy disregard\" of what makes there show good. Tony Sokol from \"Den of Geek\" thought that the episode is a \"singular highlight\" of the 26th season."}

Flanders's first wife died in season 11. \nMarcia Wallace was the voice actor for Edna Krabappel. Wallace died in 2013. When she died, Krabappel was not in many episodes after that.\nIn \"The Simpsons\".\nShe is a fourth grade teacher at Springfield Elementary School. She does not like her job as a teacher. In the episode \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\", it is shown that she liked to teach and help others. However, the school's bad quality and Bart Simpson made her annoyed to be at the school.\nEdna smokes a lot, even inside the school. In the episode \"Grade School Confidential\", she gets in an intimate relationship with the school's principal, Seymour Skinner. They use Bart to give messages to each other when he is in classrooms. Bart gets angry and tells all of the students about the relationship. Skinner and Edna get fired by Superintendent Chalmers, but they get their jobs back at the end of the episode. In the episode \"Bart Gets a 'Z'\", she gets fired because she was drunk at the school. She gets her job back at the end of the episode because the substitute teacher also gets drunk. In the episode \"The Ned-Liest Catch\", she gets suspended and put in a reassignment center for hurting Bart. Bart tries to get her out, but Edna falls from a ladder. Ned Flanders stops her from falling.\nLove life.\nEdna's first husband cheated on her. She told Nelzon Muntz about it by saying he \"chased something small and fluffy down the rabbit hole\". This is a metaphor for having an affair. In the episode \"Flaming Moe's\", she tries to seduce Joey Kramer and Homer Simpson. The episode \"Bart the Lover\" has Bart pretending to be a man that loves Edna.\nIn \"Grade School Confidential\", her relationship with Skinner almost made them married. However, in \"My Big Fat Geek Wedding\", Skinner does not want to marry Edna. This made Edna sad and their relationship became unstable. In \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\", it is shown that she liked Moe Szyslak before she was a teacher. When she first met Bart Simpson, Moe stopped the relationship.\nIn \"The Ned-Liest Catch\", Ned and Edna started dating. The end of the episode asked fans if Ned and Edna should be in a relationship. Most of the fans answered yes. The episode also showed that Edna dated many other people before. In \"Ned 'n Edna's Blend Agenda\", Ned and Edna got married, but not in public. After Edna's voice actor Wallace died, Edna is shown to have died in the show. The episode \"Left Behind\" has Ned become a teacher so he can think of Edna more.\nCreation and popularity.\nKrabappel's family name (last name) was named after the fruit \"crabapple\". This is a reference to the character Miss Crabtree from \"Our Gang\".\nMarcia Wallace won an Emmy Award (for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance) in 1992 for being the voice actor of Edna. Tilda Swinton said that she made her hair look like Edna's in the movie \"Burn After Reading\".\nRetirement.\nMarcia Wallace died on October 25, 2013. The people who worked on the show said that they knew that she was ill. Al Jean (the show's showrunner) was very sad when he learned that Marcia Wallace died. He said that the show will retire her character. This means that she will not usually be in episodes anymore. In \"Four Regrettings and a Funeral\", the episode's chalkboard gag says \"We'll really miss you Mrs. K\"."}

It was first shown on the Fox network on October 19, 1997. The episode is about how Lisa Simpson got a saxophone.\nStory.\nHomer and Bart try to watch television. They can not hear it because they think Lisa's saxophone is too loud. Bart goes to her room and tries to take it from her. Bart accidentally throws it out of the window. The saxophone gets hit by a car. Lisa gets very sad and does not remember how she got a saxophone. Homer tells her by using a flashback on how she got it.\nIn the flashback, Bart goes to his first day of school. He is sad because school is not going well for him. Homer and Marge go to the school's psychologist. While they are talking about Bart, the psychologist learns that Lisa is very smart. He tells them that they should care for Lisa's smart intelligence. They try to put Lisa in a private school, but it costs too much money. Their town then gets a very big heat wave. Homer tries to save some money to buy an air conditioner. Marge does not want Homer to buy one until they know how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart becomes friends with Milhouse Van Houten and other students because he is humorous. \nHomer learns that musical instruments are great for a smart child. He uses the money he saved to buy a saxophone for Lisa. After the flashback, Homer buys a new saxophone for Lisa. \nProduction.\n\"Lisa's Sax\" is the first episode to be written by Al Jean without someone else. Before this, he would write with Mike Reiss. Jean, Reiss, and David Stern made small changes to the screenplay. This is the 6th episode to be about flashbacks. The first episode that does this is \"The Way We Was\". In that episode, Homer graduates from high school in 1974. This made it not easy to write the time of \"Lisa's Sax\" because the episode is in 1990. Jean thought that the episode was short, so they made Lisa play her new saxophone at the end of the episode.\nDominic Polcino is the director of the episode. He thought that the epsiode was easy to direct. At the start of the episode, Policno made a pastel drawing of Krusty the Clown. He said that it is the only drawing he has made for the show all done by him. This is the last episode that has Doris Grau as the voice actor for Lunchlady Doris. She died two years before the episode was first shown on television. Tress MacNeille became the new voice actor for Doris in 2006.\nReception.\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\") said that it is \"a terrific episode\". They thought it was nice to see Bart younger. Robert Canning from IGN said that the episode is \"very funny\" and that it is \"loaded with \"Simpson\" heart.\" Stephen Becker from \"The Dallas Morning News\" thought that the 9th season has a \"special affinity for Lisa\". He thought this after seeing this episode, \"Das Bus\", and \"Lisa the Simpson\". \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" said that this episode, \"All Singing, All Dancing\", and \"Trash of the Titans\" are memorable episodes of the show.

The vehicle was marketed under Ford Motor Company in the States and Canada. It was made from the 1971 to 1980 model years. Pinto was the smallest American Ford car since 1907. It was Ford's first subcompact vehicle in North America. \nThe Pinto was manufactured in three body styles: two-door sedan, three-door hatchback and two-door station wagon. Mercury had rebadged versions of the Pinto, the Mercury Bobcat, from 1974 to 1980 (1975 to 1980 in the United States). Over three million Pintos were made over its ten-year production run. \nSince the 1970s, the safety reputation of the Pinto has made controversy. Several deadly fires related to tanks rupturing happened during rear-end crashes. In 1974, to meet federal regulations, five-mile-per-hour bumpers were included on the front and rear. \nIn the 1977 model year, Pinto wagons were given a new option package. Some wagons were called the \"Pinto Cruising Wagon\". This was the sedan delivery version of Pinto. It was styled to look like a small conversion van. It had round side panel bubble windows and a choice of optional vinyl graphics.\nIn 1977, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration did an investigation on Ford. In 1978 (the following year), the NHTSA warned Ford of their determination their Pinto fuel system was bad.\nIn June 1978, Ford recalled over 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats, the largest automotive industry recall at that time. Ford, however, disagreed with the NHTSA finding of a defect."}

The child is under a certain age, usually 18. Most child marriages are between a girl and a man, and are rooted in gender inequality. It can also be the marriage of two children. There's a minimum age for a person to be able to marry. This age is called marriable age. Very often, it is similar to the age of consent. \nAs of 2019, child marriage affects about 765 million people; 650 million of them are girls or young women. There's no widely accepted definition of what child marriage is. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says that in a child marriage, at least one of the people entering marriage has not reached age 18. Even though mosts states have a minimal age at which people can be married, this is often not respected. There may be cultural or religious reasons. Other reasons why someone is married as a child include that the parents want to make sure the girl is a virgin, when she gets married. Another reason may be that the family cannot afford the education or the upkeep of the child; when the child is married, there are no more costs to the family. Poverty is one of the main reasons for child marriage. \nThe age when children legally turn into adults, and the age at which they can legally marry are usually at 18 years of age. The age when they can marry may be different from country to country. Even when it is set at 18, people may marry when they are younger, given that their parents agree. There may also be special circumstances, such as a teenage pregnancy.\nChild marriage violates the rights of children. It has long-term consequences for child brides and child grooms. Very often, girls that went to school before they were married stop going to school. Because of poor education, their career opportunities are limited. An early pregnancy and childbirth also has adverse health effects on girls. For boys the situation is similar: they may not be well prepared for their role as a father. Also because they have not finished their education, their career opportunities are limited. Child marriage includes civil cohabitation and court-approved early marriages after teenage pregnancy.\nCauses of child marriages include poverty, dowry, cultural traditions, illiteracy, and the thoughts that women are unable to work for money. Research shows that to some extent telling children about sex can help prevent child marriage.\nChild marriages have been common throughout history. They are still fairly widespread, particularly in developing countries such as parts of Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. Even in developed countries such as the United States legal exceptions mean that 17 US states have no minimum age requirement for marriage. The incidence of child marriage has been falling in most parts of the world. 2018 data from UNICEF showed that about 21 percent of young women worldwide (aged 20 to 24) were married as children. This is a 25 percent decrease from 10 years before. The countries with the highest observed rates of child marriages below the age of 18 were Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the Central African Republic, Mozambique, and Nepal with rates above 50%. Niger, Chad, Bangladesh, Mali and Ethiopia were the countries with child marriage rates greater than 20% below the age of 15, according to 2003\u20132009 surveys. Globally, an estimated 12 million girls annually are being married under the age of 18. Child marriage is common among Roma people, also known as Gypsies."}

As the photograph shows, for much of its upper reaches, the river is braided. It runs across wide shingle beds. As the river approaches the Canterbury Plains, it passes through a belt of mountains.

Liberia is made of multiple ethnic groups. In the civil wars these groups fought for power and influence. On the other had, there were warlords, who fought each other. The civil wars were also about who had control of the natural resources of the country. Child soldiers were common during these wars. \nThe first war lasted from 1989 to 1996. Charles Taylor started an armed uprising against president Samuel Doe. Doe was quickly captured, and one of Taylor's associates, Yormie Johnson, tortured him to death. Johnson later split from Taylor, and founded his own movement. The supporters of Doe also founded their own movement, fighting went on between the different factions. All parties were very brutal when it came to interactions with civilians. Joshua Milton Blahyi, a young warlord, who was better known as General Butt Naked, was especially cruel. Using child soldiers, he is said to have killed 20,000 civilians. The UN enforced an embargo against Liberia. \nAt the same time, there was a civil war in Sierra Leone. Charles Taylor supported a rebel force in Sierra Leone. He is said to have traded with blood diamonds. \nThe first war lasted until 1996. In 1997, Taylor was elected president. He obtained about 75% of the votes, the elections were called free and fair.\nThe former enemies of Taylor didn't want to accept the election result, and they started the second war, in 1989. In 2003, the government held control over a third of the country, two thirds were controlled by rebel groups. In 2003, an international arrest warrant was issued against Taylor, for crimes he had committed when supporting the rebels in Sierra Leone. Taylor agreed to step down and leave the county, which ended the war. \nBecause of both wars, about 250,000 people were killed. Over a million became displaced people or refugees. Some stayed in refugee camps in Liberia, others fled to the neighboring countries. \nThe wars had a big impact on the economy, which can still be seen. In some regions in Liberia, up to 85% of the workforce are unemployed. "}

It was first shown on the Fox network on October 3, 1999. The episode is about Bart Simpson getting a prescription to take a drug. \nThe episode was written by George Meyer. Mark Kirkland is the director of the episode. Meyer did not like his first writing of the episode. He used a fake name when he showed others his writing. The episode makes humor of children in school being misdiagnosed (diagnosed wrong) with ADHD. Mark McGwire is a guest star for the episode.\nStory.\nPrincipal Skinner teaches his students about fire prevention. However, Bart makes a very big wave that floods the school's gym and schoolyard. Skinner is very angry at Bart. Skinner tells Homer and Marge that Bart has been diagnosed with ADHD. Bart must take the drug Focusyn (a parody of Ritalin). Marge is worried because Focusyn is a new drug and it might not be safe. \nBart takes Focusyn and does better in school. He is good to his parents and he is the tutor of a Navajo boy. However, Bart starts to feel paranoid. He thinks that Major League Baseball is spying on the town with satellites. A doctor tells Bart to stop taking Focusyn. Bart does not want to and overdoses.\nBart goes to a military base and takes a tank. He drives the tank to his school. Bart shoots at the sky. A satellite from Major League Baseball falls from the sky with documents on what everyone does. Mark McGwire comes from the satellite and distracts everyone. He puts the documents under his cap. He gives Bart a baseball bat so he can keep spying on the Simpson family. \nProduction.\n\"Brother's Little Helper\" was written by George Meyer. The episode was first named \"Bart a Go Go\". \"Bart's Inner Child\" was the last episode he wrote himself before this one. He was tired after writing that episode. He came back to writing with this episode. He thought it was not easy to write the episode because he was going through \"psychological problems\". He did not like what he wrote, so he showed it to the other writers using a fake name (a pseudonym). Tim Long said that it was \"an amazing draft\". Matt Selman came up with the idea of Bart getting a tank. He said that he got the idea after watching the news on a guy who died going \"nuts with a tank\".\nThe side effects of Focusyn on Bart were shown with many small changes to him. When Bart is reading a book, a line below his cheek is added. Bart is later seen speed reading and his pupils are smaller. The animators were not sure if Bart's pupils should be bigger or smaller than normal. Kirkland said that there were many model sheets (pictures that help animators draw characters) \"going back and forth over the fax machines\". The animators made Bart's pupils smaller in the episode. When Bart is with a doctor, he swallows many pills. He was first going to swallow all of the pills in the jar, but the censors did not like it. Mark McGwire is a guest star for the episode. Mike Scully said that McGwire was \"probably the biggest man\" he had seen and that he \"did a great job\".\nReception.\nRobert Canning from IGN thought that the episode is \"funny\" and that it is better than other episodes from the 11th season. However, he thought that the part of the episode with McGwire was not as funny as it should have been. Brian Tallerico from The Deadbolt thought that it was one of the best episodes of the season. Colin Jacobsson from DVD Movie Guide said that the episode has \"some good laughs\". He likes the morals of the episode but he did not like how Bart acted when he was on too much Focusyn.\nDeroy Murdock from Scripps Howard News Service said that the episode \"predicts the news.\" He says this because Bill Clinton had a conference five months after the episode was shown on television. The conference was about students taking too much drugs. The word \"exorcism tongs\" was made up in the episode. Cracked.com put the word in a list of the best words that were made up by \"The Simpsons\". In the episode, Homer eats taffy with Focusyn inside it and starts to act crazy. Todd Flanders asks his father Ned if Homer has \"a demon\". Ned tells him \"Looks like it. Run and get daddy's exorcism tongs.\""}

A person with afrophobia hates and fears Black people and anyone of African descent. The term \"afrophobia\" is observable in as discrimination and racist violence on the basis of a persons skin colour, ethnic origin, and nationality. Afrophobia is like homophobia or Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination grounds in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood. \u00a0Afrophobia can also intersect with other grounds such as sex, homophobia, islamophobia, and disability creating cases of multiple discrimination grounds. A person who displays afrophobia or is thought to do so is described as being afrophobic and labeled as an afrophobe.\nThere is also afrofobic hate crimes through afrophobic verbal abuse, degrading language, physical violence against black people. \nMillions of black Europeans lack equal access to education, employment, housing, as well as goods and services. A 2009 survey by the EU fundamental rights agency shows that 41 per cent of sub-Saharan African respondents had been discriminated against on the basis of their ethnicity at least once in the previous 12 months.\nBlack people in the United Kingdom are on average six times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people. A recent report on Afrophobia in Sweden reveals that Afro-Swedes are the Swedish minority most exposed to hate crimes."}

White Americans made the American Colonization Society and bought the land in 1822. They didn't want black people who were not slaves to be in the United States. So they took some of them to Liberia. At the start of the American Civil War (in the 1860s) about 12,000 freed slaves lived there. \nThe name of the country means \"Land of the Free\" in Latin. Liberia gained its independence on July 26, 1847. Joseph Jenkins Roberts was the first president of Liberia. European states were quick to recognize Liberia as a state, but it took the US until 1862 to do so. Many of the black people who were sent to Liberia were missionaries. Its official language today is English because of this history.\nIn the 1990s and in the early 2000s, two civil wars badly affected the country. \nThe country's constitution is similar to that of the United States. In the 2017 elections, George Weah became the twenty-fifth President of Liberia. The President before Weah was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first African female president.\nIn August 2021, spurred on by President George Weah who called for a roadmap, the Senate voted on a series of recommendations to finally turn the page on this war. It starts with the creation of a victims compensation fund."}

This made Trump the only president to be impeached twice. After the impeachment, a trial happened in the United States Senate. It happened after his presidency ended. The Senate voted that Trump was not guilty, with only 57 guilty votes. Over two thirds (67) votes were needed for Trump to be found guilty.\nBackground.\nAfter the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters on January 6, 2021, many government officials said that Trump had told them to do it. Because of this, Members of Congress from both the Democratic Party wanted to remove Trump from his office as President of the United States. Most Republicans still support the President.\nTwenty-fifth amendment.\nFirstly, they wanted Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be used by Vice President Mike Pence, which would remove office from Trump immediately. If he didn't do this, they said they would impeach him in the House of Representatives and convict him in the Senate instead. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment was also talked about.\nImpeachment plans.\nAs of January 8, Democrats planned to push for an impeachment resolution on January 11. By late January 9, it was said that Pence had not ruled out that he might use the 25th Amendment. On January 11, an Article of Impeachment saying that Trump caused the \"lawless action at the Capitol\" began in the United States House of Representatives.\nOn January 13, the House voted to impeach Trump."}

Usually at the start of the dry season, a plot of land is cleared of its vegetation. Very often, this is done manually, for example using machetes. This can take a long time, clearing a hectare can take up to 120 hours of work. If the land is to be used for crops that last more than two years, the roots need to be cleared as well. Usually this is not done for annual plants. The plants cleared are left to dry, often for weeks. When they are dry enough, they are burnt. The ash that is created makes the soil fertile. Weeds, and other pests have also been eliminated, so the field can be used for agriculture. After three to five years, the extra fertility is gone, and the farmer usually moves ot another field (or again uses slash-and-burn).\nProblems.\nWhile the technique is very simple, it also has problems: Often, fires created get out of control, and more land is burned than necessary. That way, a territory the size of Belgium burned down in a fire, created in 1989, in the state of Roraima in Brazil. In general, there are few large fires in the rainforest. the climate is very wet, and rivers block the fires. In southeast Asia, between May and October, many people have health problems because of the clouds of smoke. During that time, slash-and-burn operations happen in Indonesia. These fires are responsible for the clouds. \nMillions of people use slash-and-burn agriculture, often as a way of subsistence farming. For this reason, the practice cannot be outlawed. Some steps can be taken ot lessen the impact on the ecosystem:"}

It is also used as an adjective for things related to lesbianism. It began as a homophobic and misogynistic term for a masculine or butch girl or woman.\nThe origin of the term \"dyke\" is obscure. Many theories have come out. Most theories tell that \"dyke\" comes off the word \"bulldyke\", which has a similar meaning.\nFrom the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, \"dike\" had been American slang for the well-dressed man. \"Diked out\" and \"out on the dike\" meant a young man was in his best clothes.\nThe word \"dyke\" was used in the 1950s as a derogatory term for lesbians by straight people. But it was also used by lesbians of higher social status to mean crude and rough-bar lesbians.\nFacebook controversy.\nFacebook censored use of the word \"dyke\" as \"abusive content\" in June 2017 on its website. The decision triggered a Change.org protest petition created by the \"Listening 2 Lesbians\" collective. It was signed by 7,247 supporters.\nDyke Marches have become popular gay pride events in the United States and Canada.

On January 13, 2021, she was executed by lethal injection.\nExperts, who looked at the case after she had been condemned, found that when she committed the crime, she had suffered from psychosis. Because of smoking tobacco, she had also suffered permanent brain damage. In addition, she mistrusted men in general.\nA history of abuse.\nMontgomery had a bad childhood. Her stepfather allegedly raped her for years. To better handle the situation, Montgomery started drinking alcohol. When Montgomery was 14, her mother discovered the abuse. Instead of helping her, her mother threatened her with a gun. From her early teen years, her mother forced her to prostitute herself. She told other people about her situation, but no one seemed to help. Montgomery tried to escape the situation, and married early, when she was 18 years old. But both her first, and a second marriage led to further abuse. Montgomery had four children. She falsely claimed to be pregnant several times, according to both her first and second husbands."}

Then they visit houses door to door, scolding children who may be guilty of laziness or bad behavior.\nThe Purpose of Namahage.\nOne of the purposes is to advise children to obey their parents and to behave themselves.\u00a0 They say\u00a0 \"Are there any crybabies around?\" or \"Are naughty kids around?\" in the local dialect.\u00a0 If parents want Namahage to encourage or tell off their children by giving a specific original way, parents can ask them in advance to give special lessons to their children.\u00a0 It lasts until children heavily cry or leave their house.\nSome researchers suggest that it relates to a belief in deities to take away bad luck and bring fortune for the new year.

While one of them implemented the festival taking countermeasures to prevent infection. In Kobukata area, actors did neither enter houses nor eat any alcohol or dishes which were yearly served as hospitality.\u00a0 One of the actors said \u201cThe most important thing is how to maintain the traditional culture to a new era.\"\u00a0 Thanks to their efforts, they could manage to maintain the tradition and take measures at the same time."}

Its population density is approximately 8000. It is the 4th largest city in Chiba prefecture.\nGeography.\nNarashino is in northwestern Chiba prefecture.\nIts population is approximately 170,000. The mayor of the city is Taisuke Miyamoto who was chosen in an election in 2011. \nFood.\nNarashino sausage.\nDuring World War I, from 1915 to 1920, about 1000 German soldiers were captured as prisoners of war and taken to an internment camp in Narashino. The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce took notice of sausage as a highly nutritious food at that time. Karl Jahn and other German prisoners had been sausage makers in Germany. The Japanese bureaucracy made these craftspeople reveal their secret recipe. That\u2019s why Narashino city is called \"the birthplace of the traditional process for making sausages.\"\nThere are some traits of the Narashino sausage. For example, the sausage is free from additional food preservatives or artificial color and made from hog casing instead of sheep casing. They are served to schoolchildren for school lunch.\nNature.\nYatsu Higata.\nIn the 1970s, most of the land near Narashino was built up due to economic growth, but the Minister of Finance kept one piece of land, a tidal flat, as it was. It was a rare habitat for migratory birds such as plovers and snipes. Water pollution and odor, however, became worse because of illegal waste dumping by people who lived nearby. \u200bSaburo Morita\u200bwho was a newspaper deliverer at that time. He started removing litters in order to clean up the tidal flat by himself. Eventually other people came to help him. They restored mud flat.\nThis tidal flat was entered into \u200bRamsar Convention \u200bin 1993. Now all of the elementary school students in Narashino have been to the area at least once. There is an observatory that provides visitors with information on the area.\nCelebrities.\nDaiki Arioka\u200b: a member of \"Hey Say Jump\" (one of the Johnny\u2019s)\nKazuya Fukuura\u200b: a former professional baseball player (belonged to Chiba Lotte Marines)\nDaichi Suzuki\u200b: a former professional swimmer (100-meter backstroke gold medalist Seoul Olympic held in 1988)\nConfectionery.\nLe P\u00e2tissier Yokoyama.\nIn 2001, the first shop was opened in Yatsu (the second store in Okubo).

He makes independent or 'indie' games. Indie games are not made by big companies, but small groups of people. He made the indie games company Failbetter Games in 2009, and was its CEO until 2016. In 2017, he made a new company called Weather Factory. Kennedy's games are known for being different to most video games. He refers to them as \"weird\" and \"experimental\", meaning they have new ideas and work differently to other games.\n\"Fallen London\".\nIn 2009, Kennedy made a game called \"Fallen London\". \"Fallen London\" is set in a world where Victorian England was different to the real world. In the game, the city of London was taken down under the ground by strange bats and put in an underground world called the Neath, where it is always nighttime. \"Fallen London\" has been called a horror game. It has also been compared to Romanticism, a style of art from the 19th century about feelings, imagination, and freedom.\n\"Fallen London\" is a browser game. People play browser games in their web browser, rather than downloading it on their computer or buying it from a store. In 2020, in a quote from his book \"Sex, Lies, and Videogames\" (which was not yet published), Kennedy said the game was meant to be a different kind of game like them. He wanted to do something different, but still be a browser game.\nMany people liked \"Fallen London\". Gaming journalists gave it good reviews. Some of them liked it so much they gave it awards.\n\"Sunless Sea\".\nBecause so many people liked \"Fallen London\", Kennedy and his company Failbetter Games decided to make a new game set in the Neath. The game, \"Sunless Sea\", came out in 2015.\n\"Sunless Sea\" is set in the Unterzee, the name for the ocean in the Neath. The player plays a sea captain who sails (called 'zailing' in the game) the Unterzee. They might 'zail' to make money, to become famous, or for more personal reasons, such as in memory of their dead father. \"Sunless Sea\" is a computer role-playing game, but it also has some parts from other kinds of games. For instance, it has the roguelike traits that you need to make a new character if you die, and you need to keep track of your food and fuel.\nLike \"Fallen London\", \"Sunless Sea\" was very well liked. It got the last perfect 10/10 rating from the video game magazine \"Eurogamer\". It also sold many copies. In 2018, Kennedy said it had sold 350,000 copies.\nWeather Factory.\nIn 2016, Kennedy decided to leave Failbetter Games, the company he made \"Fallen London\" and \"Sunless Sea\" with. He made a new company, Weather Factory, to make new games. These games were not set in the Neath. However, they still had a lot in common with his old games.\nThe first game Weather Factory made was called \"Cultist Simulator\". It came out in 2018. The player character in \"Cultist Simulator\" is someone who studies the occult, which is secret spiritual ideas about the way the world works. They want to make a cult of followers who can help them become more powerful. They need to do this while making sure they do not die, go to prison, or go insane.\nLike the other games, \"Cultist Simulator\" had good reviews. A lot of people compared it to stories by H.P. Lovecraft, a man who wrote strange stories about horror, madness, and cults.\nWeather Factory is making another game called \"Book of Hours\" about an occult librarian. \"Book of Hours\" will come out in 2023.\nLife.\nWhen Kennedy started to make games, his ex-wife was pregnant and his daughter was going to be born. He decided to start making games because he was worried he wouldn't ever do it if he didn't start then. Before making games, he was a teacher. When Kennedy was a child, his father died, and when he was a young adult, his brother died. He has said these deaths are a part of why he writes the things he does.\nIn 2019, some people accused Kennedy of sexual harassment. They said he dated some women who worked at Failbetter Games, and that he was mean to those women and hurt them. Kennedy said that the people saying these things were wrong, and that they were hurting him."}

This type of processing only works when there are timing constraints, i.e. files do not need to be updated immediately or a response from the computer is not needed right away.\nAdvantage.\nOne advantage of batch processing is that the computer can wait to process the batch until it is less busy. For example, it can do the jobs in the job queue overnight. Fields with batch processing include billing systems (e.g. electricity, gas, water and telephone), payroll systems and processing of bank cheques."}

It is known for its colorful fur. The red-shanked douc lives in forests in Vietnam and Cambodia.\nAppearance.\nThe adult red-shanked douc is about 61\u201376\u00a0cm tall, and its tail is about 56\u201376\u00a0cm long. It weighs about 8\u201311\u00a0kg. Red-shanked doucs have black hind legs that are red from knee to ankle. They have white hips, tails and forearms, and reddish yellow faces. They have red and black stripes over their eyes. Male red-shanked doucs have white scrotums, red penises and white patches on their bottoms. This makes it easy for humans to tell male and female red-shanked doucs apart.\nRange.\nThe red-shanked douc lives in Vietnam and Cambodia. They live as high as 2000 m (6600 feet) up in the mountains. They live in semi-deciduous forests and in primary and secondary rainforests. They live in the middle of to upper levels of the canopy.\nReproduction.\nFemale red-shanked doucs are old enough to mate at 4 years. Male red-shanked doucs are old enough to mate at 4 or 5 years.\nRed-shanked doucs display before mating. They drop their jaws, wave their eyebrows, and shake their heads at each other. Scientists say the female red-shanked douc always makes the first move. She lies down on a branch and looks over her shoulder at the male. Sometimes he comes to mate with her and sometimes he does not.\nThe red-shanked douc breeds from August to December, and gives birth to one offspring after a gestation period of 6 to 7 months. They are born with their eyes wide open and hang on to their mothers instinctively. Between 8 and 24 months of age, the color of the fur and face changes slowly. They have adult colors at 10 months.\nSometimes, adult red-shanked doucs will feed and care for orphaned baby red-shanked doucs.\nDiet.\nThe red-shanked douc is awake during the day. It eats leaves that are high in fiber. They prefer to eat small, young and tender leaves. They moreover eat fruit like figs, buds, petioles, flowers, bamboo shoots and seeds. They eat 50 different plant species, however, no animal prey. They eat peacefully together and not quarrel over food. They are known to share food with others.\nBehavior.\nRed-shanked doucs live in groups. They usually live in groups of 4 to 15 relatives. Each group has one or more male and about two females per male. The males tend to dominate over the females.\nRed-shanked doucs cannot grasp things with their tails. They use their tails for balance instead. They use arms and legs to move through the forest. They follow the same routes. The adult males lead the group, the females and very young doucs are in the middle, and young males go last. When the doucs sense a predator or other danger, they flee very quietly through the trees. They spend most of their time eating, digesting their bulky food, sleeping and grooming each other's fur. They communicate with facial expressions and sounds. The low-pitch grow indicates threat, and short and hash distress squeal.\nThreats.\nAs reported by the most recent assessment of IUCN Red List, the red-shanked douc is critically endangered. They are listed in CITES that prohibit international trade. There is no research of the population in Indochina. In Son Tra, Vietnam, the population is approximately 1300 individuals. The most common reason is that they are hunted for substance use and traditional medicine. Moreover local people hunt for food, pets or making glue."}

It was built in 1908 during the Meiji Period. It was used as a prison until 2017. It has been named an Important Cultural Property. It is being rebuilt as a hotel and scheduled to open in 2024.\nHistory.\nArchitect Keijiro Yamashita designed the former Nara Prison. It was made as part of the Meiji government's plan to be modern. It opened in 1908. In 1910, 935 people were accommodated in this prison although the maximum capacity was 650 people. In 1922, Japan passed the Juvenile Law. The prison was renamed twice in 1922 and 1946.\nThe former Nara prison was renamed \"the Nara Juvenile Prison\" in 1946. Prisoners were between 16 and 26 years old. The prison had education programs so the prisoners would be less likely to commit more crimes after being released from prison. This was the first place in Japan to have a sexual offense recidivism prevention program. There was also a lot of remedial guidance that appealed to individual personalities, such as violence avoidance education, social development education, and hope development courses. Prisoners were also given vocational training for jobs. The Wakakusa Barber Shop was one of these vocational programs. Trained inmates gave haircuts to staff and citizens.\nIn 2017, it was designed as an important cultural asset. It stopped working as a prison in March 31.\nBuilding.\nThe building has Romanesque architecture and was made of highly fireproof red brick. These bricks were made by prisoners. British stacking was used because it is easy to install and strong. A structure called a Haviland system, in which the prison buildings were spread out in a radial pattern around a watchtower, was used. This helped the guards see what was happening.\nHotel.\nThe Former Nara Prison stopped working a prison in March 2017 because the buildings were too old. Instead of being knocked down, the government decided to reopen it as a hotel in 2024. The hotel is to be called the Hoshino Resort, a major Japanese inn brand. The hotel was originally scheduled to open in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant it had to be done later. Hoshino Resort, MUJI, and Solare Hotels and Resorts all plan to work on making the former prison into a hotel."}

Like other forms of economic capital, sexual capital can be converted to other forms of capital. Sexual capital can be useful in getting social or economic capital. British sociologist Catherine Hakim first used the term \"erotic capital\", in the early 2000s. French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu had already defined other forms of capital, such as economic, cultural, or social capital. Hakim saw sexual capital as different. She says erotic capital is independent of class origin; for this reason, it enables social mobility. Hakim argues that this makes erotic capital socially subversive, which results in the prevailing power structures devaluing and trying to suppress it. In the manosphere, the parallel term \"sexual market value\" or its abbreviation \"SMV\" is often used.\nNobel prize winner Gary Becker developed a theory of human capital. In 1972, Michael Grossmann had developed the term \"health capital\". Robert Michael extended this term to include sexual capital. Maichal says, if an individual choses to use his or her sexual attractivness, this is a rational choice, and the individual will expect something in return."}

Their home arena is in the city, but the team also plays out of Brovary, still within the Kyiv region.\nSokil is developed many of the country's top young hockey players, producing NHL All Stars such as Dmitri Khristich and Alexei Zhitnik, and Stanley Cup Champions Ruslan Fedotenko and Anton Babchuk.\nFranchise history.\n1963\u20131973: Dynamo.\nThe team was founded in the summer of 1963 by the Deputy Chairman of Sports of Ukraine, Adrian Miziak, under the name of \"Dynamo Kyiv\". 1963 may be the official birth date of the team, but it was a decade earlier that a Dynamo team from Kyiv would play in the Soviet Cup, making it as far as the second round of the playoffs. The current incarnation, however, would begin its hockey operations in the second tier of Soviet ice hockey, holding its first game on 27 October 1963 against SKA Kuybyshev.\n1973\u20131996: The Falcons.\nFor the club's 10th anniversary in 1973, the club would drop the Dynamo name. The historical white and blue colors of the Dynamo sports society would be kept intact, but the team would adopt the name of the \"Falcon\", or \"Sokil\" in Ukrainian. Though Sokil's play would remain inconsistent throughout the 70s, the hiring of Anatoli Bogdanov as head coach in 1976 would have an immediate impact on the team's fortunes.\n1996\u20132009: transitions.\nWith the dissolution of the IHL, orphaned teams from the Soviet Bloc found a home in the newly formed Eastern European Hockey League. Benefiting from a lower level of competition than that of the Russian league, and new head coach Oleksandr Seukand, the team would find renewed success. Sokil would finish 1st overall in 4 of the league's 8 seasons, and become league champions in both 1998 and 1999.\nPresent.\nFollowing the 2008\u201309 season in the Russian league, the club announced they would rejoin the Belarusian Extraleague for the following year. This was a move largely attributed to the financial burdens brought on by the Russian Ice Hockey Federation's (RHF) mandate that foreign teams pay for the travel, accommodations, and meals of visiting teams. The RHF also demanded that foreign teams pay an annual fee of p.\u00a01,500,000 (approx \u20ac35,000).\nTeam colours and mascot.\nLogo.\nThe team's original colors as Dynamo were, hence the nickname that has held to this day (\"white-blues\"), white and blue. When the Sokil name was adopted, the team changed their colors to red and blue, the same colors of the Kyiv coat of arms of the time. The team would eventually return to its white and blue roots, along with the addition of a darker accent of blue, as well as black.\nJerseys.\nThe team's original jerseys were white with horizontal blue striping. In 1973, the primary color of red was added, and the body striping was eliminated for a more contemporary look. When the sponsor's name (\"Eskulap\") was added briefly in 1992, the team logo was changed to a tryzub. Also, the Coca-Cola logo was added to the front of the team's jerseys for a period of time."}

Burns takes Homer to his private airplane to go to Chicago. Homer gets very good services in the plane. Homer is very happy when he is in Chicago. However, he is sad when he has to go back to Springfield. He says that he will not feel as happy as he was in Mr. Burns's airplane. Marge gets Homer a life coach named Colby Kraus. Colby wants to help Homer get happy from flying airplanes. He watches what Homer does for a few days. He learns that Homer is happier when he is at a bowling alley. Colby tells Homer to always wear the shoes he wears for bowling. Homer gets better at doing things and gets offers for new jobs. Homer does an interview for a job that will let him fly. However, he does not get hired.\nHomer does not tell his family that he did not get the job. He goes to Krusty Burger so that his family thinks he is at his job. On the day after that, Bart sees Homer at Krusty Burger. Homer tells Bart about his interview and that he did not get the job. Bart makes Homer go to a pay phone to talk to Marge about it. Homer lies to her and tells her to go to an airport with him. Homer and Marge get on a plane so that Homer feels better when telling her the truth. However, the person flying it gets unconscious. Homer tries to fly the plane but does not know how. Marge makes the plane go up using the plane's yoke. She calls Colby with her cell phone and tries to get him to help. He talks to Homer and gives him motivation on getting the airplane down. The airplane comes down and gets on the runway. However, the plane keeps moving and falls in the ocean. Homer says to Marge that flying airplanes is not safe for him. He says that he will get his job back at the power plant with Mr. Burns. \nProduction.\n\"He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs\" was the first new episode to show on television after \"The Simpsons Movie\" was shown in theaters.

He said that the writers went back to their \"old clich\u00e9s\" and that the same jokes were said too many times. He liked the start of the episode that shows the events after the movie. Robert Canning from \"IGN\" said that the episode is \"mediocre\". He thought that Colbert being in the episode was \"disappointing\". He liked some parts of the episode.

After the St. Jude storm, lots of storms went across western Europe. They brought winds and rain.\nA low air pressure area named Godehard was the strongest of these low air pressure areas. It caused some damage in Wales. Its winds left 10,000 homes without electricity in Wales. It happened on the first weekend of November 2013.\nOn November 2, the M4 Motorway between Margam and Pyle was closed because of the weather and a roof canopy at the Princess of Wales Hospital Bridgend was damaged. The old Severn Bridge on the M48 motorway was closed. On the the Second Severn Crossing speed restrictions to slow cars down. The low air pressure also brought big waves to Aberystwyth which caused some damage to houses near the sea.\n2013 Nordic Windstorms.\nAn area of high air pressure formed to the west of Britain and Ireland. It formed from late November to early December. It caused many storms to go north to Norway and Sweden. All the storms moved north of the United Kingdom. This meant that in November the country was fairly dry. In December there were long periods of calm weather in France. It was sunny and dry. The weather changed as storms brought strong rain and snowfall to the mountains towards the end of the month. \nUntil December 14, France (and the United Kingdom and Ireland) were protected by a strong area of high air pressure that went from Africa to the British Isles. However, the Nordic nations were affected by lots of storms, including Windstorm Hilde (November 17), Windstorm Oskari (December 1), Windstorm Xaver (December 5\u20137), Windstorm Ivar (December 12) and Windstorms Zaki and Adam (December 14\u201315).\nThe high air pressure over Britain, Ireland and the Atlantic moved east during the middle of December. It allowed areas of low air pressure to reach western Europe. During the middle of December the jet stream became unusually strong in the North Atlantic. The storms moved under this strong jet stream where they quickly became strong before reaching Western Europe.\nChristmas and New Year Windstorms.\nWindstorm Bernd (18\u201319 December).\nThe first storm of this period was named Bernd. The storm was also named Emily after Emily Bront\u00eb the author. She died on December 19 165 years ago. She also wrote the book Wuthering Heights. Met \u00c9ireann (Ireland) gave red warnings for wind at 9:00am on December 18 to many counties in Ireland including Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo. The United Kingdom Met Office gave orange warnings for the Highlands, Western Isles, Strathclyde and Northern Ireland.\nWindstorm Dirk (23\u201324 December).\nDirk formed over North America, and caused some storms in Canada, before it moved into the Atlantic. The weather in North America after saw a steep temperature gradient. It made the jet stream in the North Atlantic stronger. The storm moved under this strong jet stream where it quickly became stronger before reaching Western Europe.\nDirk created the lowest air pressure in Britain and Ireland since 1886 (127 years ago). The all-time low air pressure record for the British Isles was recorded in 1884 (129 years ago).\nWindstorms Felix &amp; Gerhard.\nA stormy period between Christmas and New Year followed as Weather fronts related with the Windstorms Felix (December 30) and Gerhard (January 1, New Year's day) passed over the United Kingdom. It caused even more rainfall and storms to the area.\nWindstorm Felix was more remote from the European mainland. It brought strong winds in North-West France in the Brittany area. Storminess near Iceland brought winds up to 140 kilometers per hour (87 miles per hour) to that country. It brought heavy rainfall and more flooding to the United Kingdom. Over the holiday period, several New Year outdoor swimming events were cancelled.[\"citation needed\"]"}

Pressing the search button while an application is open allows users to search within applications that take advantage of this feature; for example, pressing Search in the People hub lets users search their contact list for specific people. This has been changed in Windows Phone 7.5 however \u2013 as the search button is reserved for Bing \u2013 so applications that previously used this feature (such as the Marketplace) now include soft search buttons.\nIn other cases, pressing the Search button will allow the user to perform a search of websites, news, and map locations using the Bing application.\nWindows Phone also has a voice recognition function, powered by TellMe, which allows the user to perform a Bing search, call contacts, or launch applications simply by speaking. This can be activated by pressing and holding the phone's Start button.\nBing is the default search engine on Windows Phone handsets due to its deep integration of functions into the OS (which also includes the utilization of its map service for location-based searches and queries).

Unlike the previous Windows Mobile operating system, there are currently no third-party applications for handling other video formats. The image file formats that are supported include JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIF, and Bitmap (BMP).\nAfter the \"Mango\" update, Windows Phone 7 added the ability for users to have custom ringtones. Ringtone audio files must be under 1MB and less than 40 seconds long. Custom ringtones still cannot be used for text messages, IMs, or emails.\nContact Online.\nContacts are organized via the \"People hub\", and can be manually entered into contacts or imported from Facebook, Windows Live Contacts, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Gmail. Contacts may be manually imported from Outlook using Windows Live Contacts or Gmail. A \"What's New\" section shows the news feed and a \"Pictures\" section show pictures from those social networks made by the contacts. A \"Me\" section shows the phone user's own social network status and wall, allow the user to update his status and check into Bing and Facebook Places. Contacts can be added to the home screen by pinning them to the start. The contact's \"Live Tile\" displays his social network status and profile picture on the home screen and the contact's hub displays his Facebook wall as well as all of the rest of his contact information and information from his other social networks.\nIf a contact has information stored on multiple networks, users can link the two separate contact accounts, allowing the information to be viewed and accessed from a single card. As of Windows Phone 7.5, contacts can also be sorted into \"Groups\". Here, information from each of the contacts is combined into a single page which can be accessed directly from the Hub or pinned to the Start screen.\nInterface.\nWindows Phone 7 features a user interface based on a design system codenamed and commonly referred to as Metro. The home screen, called \"Start screen\", is made up of \"Live Tiles\". Tiles are links to applications, features, functions, and individual items (such as contacts, web pages, applications, or media items). Users can add, rearrange, or remove tiles. Tiles are dynamic and update in real-time \u2013 for example, the tile for an email account would display the number of unread messages or a tile could display a live update of the weather.\nSeveral key features of Windows Phone 7 are organized into \"hubs\", which combine local and online content via Windows Phone's integration with popular social networks such as Facebook, Windows Live, and Twitter. For example, the Pictures hub shows photos captured with the device's camera and the user's Facebook photo albums, and the People hub shows contacts aggregated from multiple sources including Windows Live, Facebook, and Gmail. From the Hub, users can directly comment and 'like' on social network updates. The other built-in hubs are Xbox Music and Video, Xbox Live Games, Windows Phone Store, and Microsoft Office. Due to Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is disabled in all bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.\nWindows Phone uses multi-touch technology. The default Windows Phone user interface has a dark theme that prolongs battery life on OLED screens as fully black pixels do not emit light. The user may choose a light theme instead, and can also choose from several accent colors. User interface elements such as tiles are shown in the user's chosen accent color.

It was first shown on the Fox network on November 19, 2006. The episode is about Lois Griffin being a teacher for sex education. She gets fired because she teaches her students about safe sex.\nThe episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong. James Purdum is the director of the episode. \nStory.\nLois sees Chris and his friends watching a pornographic movie. Chris says that their school does not have a class for sex education. She becomes his school's teacher for sex education. She teaches her students about safe ways to do premarital sex (sex before marriage). On the next day, many parents are angry at her. Lois gets fired for teaching about safe sex. A reverend becomes the new sex education teacher. He talks about sexual abstinence (not doing sex). In the class, Meg gets a boyfriend named Doug. While this happens, One of Stewie's teeth falls out of his mouth. Brian tells him about the tooth fairy. Stewie fears that the tooth fairy will take his tooth. He tries to use Herbert's teeth, but they are not real. He takes the tooth of a girl with an eating disorder. Brian thinks that Stewie is being very crazy, so he tells Stewie that the tooth fairy is not real. However, a man named T. Fairy takes the tooth from the girl with the eating disorder. \nPeter hears what Meg is being taught and thinks that sex is bad. He starts wearing a chastity belt so that Lois does not have sex with him. Lois rapes Peter so that he will like sex again. After that, Lois sees Meg and Doug doing \"ear sex\" (putting a penis in an ear). Meg thinks that ear sex is still abstinence. Lois goes back to the school and tells everyone that it is okay to do sex before marriage, but it should be done in a safe way. She tells everyone to use condoms. After this, Doug sees Meg naked and they breakup. \nProduction.\nThe episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong. James Purdum is the director of the episode. Many parts of the episode were not shown on television: some parts of the pornographic movie that Chris and his friends were watching, Peter trying to do ear sex with Lois, and Peter saying the word \"abstinent\" wrong. At the end of the episode, Brian was going to be thrown out of a window. When the episode was done being made, Cleveland Brown talks to the Griffin family in the window.\nReception.\nAbout 9.3 million people saw the episode when it was first shown on television.

It is also called Kasumi-ga-j\u014d (\u971e\u30f6\u57ce). The castle tower was built between 1624 to 1644. It is one of the twelve existing castle towers in Japan (\u73fe\u5b58\u5341\u4e8c\u5929\u5b88, \"genzon-j\u016bni-tenshu\"), and also one of the national important cultural properties.\nHistory.\nIn 1576, Nobunaga Oda ordered Katsutoyo Shibata to build Maruoka Castle to get ready for the ikk\u014d-ikki, a rebellion by believers of the J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b sect of Buddhism in the 15th-16th centuries. In 1613, Narushige Honda became the first lord, castle owner, of the Maruoka Castle. After the Honda family, the Arima family were lords of Maruoka Castle from 1695 to 1869. Shigesumi Arima was lord from 1772 to 1830. He rebuilt the local domain economy. On 8 July 1948,\u00a0 an earthquake hit Fukui. The quake destroyed the castle tower of Maruoka Castle. But, in 1955 the castle tower was repaired by recycling more than 70% of the original materials of Maruoka Castle.\nStructure.\nMaruoka Castle\u2019s stone walls are about 6.2 meters high. The stone walls were built using \"nozura-zumi\" (\u91ce\u9762\u7a4d\u307f), an architectural method to build stone walls with a good system of drains. This protects the building from damage by heavy rain. Maruoka Castle is also famous for its steep stairs. The stairs that go up from the first floor to the second floor are at an angle of 65 degrees. The stairs from the second floor to the third floor are at an angle of 67 degrees.\nEvents.\nCherry Blossom Festival.\nAbout 400 cherry trees were planted around Maruoka Castle, and this place was chosen as one of the Japan\u2019s Top 100 Cherry Blossom Viewing Sites in 1990. There is a Cherry Blossom Festival there every year.\n\"A Brief Message From the Heart \" Letter Contest (\u4e00\u7b46\u5553\u4e0a\u8cde, \"ippitsukeij\u014d-sh\u014d\").\nShigetsugu Honda, whose son was the first lord of Maruoka Castle, sent a letter to his wife during a war at Shitaragahara in 1575. \n\"A brief message. Don't start a fire. Don't make Osen cry. Feed my horses.\"\nThis letter is said to be famous for the shortest letter in Japan, and there is a stone monument engraved with this letter in Maruoka Castle. In 1993, this contest was started to let more people know that the shortest letter was in Maruoka Castle.\nFacilities around Maruoka Castle.\nMuseum of History and Folklore.\nThis museum was opened in March 2019. On the first floor, there are exhibits of Maruoka folklore, and on the second floor, there are exhibits of the history of Maruoka Castle.\nBrief Message from the Heart Museum.\nThis museum opened on 23 August 2015. In this museum, the winning works of the Contest of Brief Massages are exhibited.\nVisitors.\nThe total number of visitors to Maruoka Castle, both paid or free, was about 150,000 in the first year of Reiwa, and about 70,000 in the second year due to the spread of coronavirus. \nMost visitors are in their 60s or older or with their families, but recently, female visitors in their 20s to 40s are also increasing due to the castle boom. The museum is also used by elementary, junior high, and high school students for school trips and field trips. \nLegend.\nIn 1576, Katsutoyo Shibata tried to build Maruoka Castle, but it had collapsed many times. Therefore, he received a proposal to stabilize the castle by putting a human pillar in the castle tower. The person chosen as the human pillar was one-eyed Oshizu, who was a woman living a difficult life with two children. Oshizu offered Katsutoyo that one of her children would serve as a samurai in the future, and she decided to become the human pillar on that condition. Although the castle was completed, Oshizu\u2019s children could not be a samurai because Katsutoyo was transferred elsewhere. Oshizu\u2019s spirit resented this, so it rains a lot every April. People call this \u201cOshizu\u2019s Tears\u201d, and they built a grave of her to console her spirit. This story is fiction, but it is one of the most famous stories of Maruoka Castle."}

There are different kinds of \"habutae\" silk such as plain or striped \"habutae\". \"Habutae\" is traditionally used for kimono and undershirts. Recently, it is also used for general goods, works of art, and clothing. \"Habutae\" is smooth to touch, glossy, and soft. It has been said \"The quality of silk fabric begins with habutae and ends with it.\" \"Fukui\" is a suitable region to produce \"habutae\" as the dryness and wetness of the air are well-balanced throughout the whole year.\nHistory.\nIn 1871, Kimimasa Yuri, who was a lord of \"Fukui\" Domain (region), brought some silk goods from Europe to Fukui when he joined a study tour in Europe. He showed the goods to people who studied silks in \"Fukui\" and they started doing technical research on weaving \"habutae\". In 1887, basic technology for weaving \"habutae\" silk was completed in \"Fukui\" city. The economic boom of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and World War I boosted progress and production of \"habutae\" in \"Fukui\". In the early 1900s, production of \"habutae\" in Fukui earned 1.7 million dollars, up to 60% of the total exports of \"habutae\" in Japan. The demand for \"habutae\" made in \"Fukui\" has kept increasing in Japan, and it is still used in many kinds of daily goods such as clothing.\nWeaving Process.\nMost of the process of making Fukui \"habutae\" silk is the same as the process of making \"habutae\" in other areas, but the weaving process of Fukui \"habutae\" silk is different from the weaving process of \"habutae\" in other areas. Also, the weaving process is the most important part of making Fukui \"habutae\" silk. Fukui \"habutae\" silk is made in a process called \"nureyoko(\u6fe1\u308c\u6a2a)\". \"Nureyoko\" is a weaving method of weaving warps and wefts which is the two basic components of weaving thread into fabric after wetting wefts with water. Threads are made from raw silks that are imported from other countries such as China and Brazil. This process makes the cloth tight, elastic, and strong. It takes one day to weave 20 meters of \"habutae\"."}

It is located at Nagatach\u014d 1-chome 7\u20131, Chiyoda, Tokyo.\nSessions of the House of Representatives take place in the left wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the right wing.\nThe Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is made of only Japanese materials, except for the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system.\nHistory.\nPlans for a Diet building began in 1881. The planners hoped to finish it by 1890, when the Diet would meet for the first time. They realized they could not build a very impressive building in time, so they decided to make temporary buildings at first. The first Diet building was a Western-style building made of wood. It burned down in 1891. Another wooden building was made and finished in 1891. It burned down in 1925. A third building was made. The Diet used it until 1936, when the current Diet building was finished.\nCurrent Diet building.\nIn 1910, the Finance Ministry started a planning group to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tar\u014d chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building should be made in the Italian Renaissance architectural style. Many other people did not like this idea.\nThe ministry had a public design competition in 1918. 118 architect teams sent designs. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and B\u00f6ckmann's.\nThe Diet Building was built between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they mixed European and East Asian architecture. The actual source for the \"Pyramid\" roof remains unclear, but Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it might have come from from Shinshichi. Historian of Africa studies Zoe Strother says Shinshichi's design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 1900s, such as John Russell Pope's 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928.\nFurther reading.\nNational Diet Building at House of Councillors website"}
