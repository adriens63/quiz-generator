It can be created by the person's imagination. Sometimes, erotic literature, or pornography can help create a sexual fantasy. The same may be true for certain objects, or being attracted to another person. Anything that can produce sexual arousal can also produce a sexual fantasy.\nSexual fantasies occur in almost all societies around the world. They are rarely put into practice, mainly because of cultural, social, moral, and religious constraints. In some cases, even a discussion by a person of sexual fantasies is subject to social taboos and inhibitions. Some people find it convenient to act out fantasies through sexual roleplay. People watching porn sometimes find their fantasies validated. A fantasy may be a positive or negative experience, or even both. It may be in response to a past experience and can influence future sexual behavior\nLiterature.\nSexual fantasy is also used for a genre of literature, film or work of art. Such works may be appreciated for their aesthetics, though many people may feel uncomfortable with such works. For example, women in prison movies may be described as sexual fantasies, as are pornographic movies. In the case of movies, the term may describe a part of the movie, such as a fantasy scene or sequence. Besides pornographic films, some mainstream films have included sexual fantasy scenes, such as \"Business Is Business\" (1971), \"Amarcord\" (1973), \"American Beauty\" (1999) and others.\nReferences.\nCitations\nBibliography"}

Stories often show her as an evil spirit. She lingers around the eaves of roofs in Meitei mythology and folklore. Her story is from Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur). She is described as the one who interferes everywhere. Legend says that she could not live with human beings. Instead, she lives like a dog or a jackal, sitting on the graves.\nIn some cases, she is depicted as a minor goddess (lairembi) in the Meitei religion.\nStory.\nOnce there was a childless couple. They would play a game together. They would make riddles. Whoever lost the riddle game would give the winner a . The husband made a riddle like this: &lt;poem&gt;\n\"A man with four hands\nWith a rucksack by his side, \nIs dancing round and round.\nRolling around cheerful is another man in front.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe wife could find the answer to the riddle. Then, the husband told her the answer: \n&lt;poem&gt;\"The answer is what you do many times. You use a four spoked wheel and when you rotate it, the yarn ball rotates in the front.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThen, the wife told a new riddle to her husband:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"What is that cries when fed and stops crying when you stop feeding?\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe husband answerd that it was a \"kaptreng,\" a traditional Meitei traditional wooden tool for ginning cotton. The the wife had to give her husband a fish on the next day. They went to sleep that night. But Yenakha Paodabi, the old demoness, had been listening to their riddles. She thought of an evil plan to ruin the couple's life. While planning, she thought,\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"I should not lose this opportunity. \nTomorrow, I will impersonate the wife when she is away. \nShe will be driven away by her husband. I will stay with him as his wife for few days and one day, when he is asleep, I will cut his throat and drink his blood. Oh! How tasty it will be!\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe next day, Yenakha Paodabi did everything in to her plan: She changed her appearance so she looked like the wife. When the real wife was away at the market, Yenakha Paodabi entered the house holding a Shareng fish, when the actual woman was away to market. The husband had no doubt about the woman until his real wife returned home, creating a great surprise to him with the presence of two women who looked exactly like his wife.\nThere was a huge quarrel and then a fight between the two identical women. The husband was unable to solve the problem. So, all of them went to the King to judge their matter. After hearing the whole story, the king said to the two women, \n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"As both of you are firm on your stands, let the great God show us the truth.\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThen, as per a new plan devised by the King, a priest (maiba) got blessings from the Lainingthou (Great God) and put a hollow bamboo pipe on a banana leaf. Then, the king told the two women that only the real woman would be able to pass through the narrow bamboo pipe. The king and asked the two to try to go through the pipe to prove their real identity. But this was a trick. The demoness, not realizing, immediately transformed. She shrunk until she could fit into the hollow bamboo pipe. Then, the king immediately made his men close both the ends of the bamboo pipe. Thus, Yenakha Paodabi, was trapped. He tried to burn the bamboo pipe, but Yenakha Paodabi asked him to let her go. The king released her. From that day onwards, Yenakha Paodabi never interfered again with the couple's life."}

It is the largest city of the Vologda Oblast of Russia, but not the capital, which is Vologda. As of 2010, the city has 312,000 people.\nHistory.\nCherepovets was founded by two orthodox monks Feodosy and Afanasy in November 4, 1777. In 1362, they founded the Cherepovets Resurrection Monastery, in the vicinity of which Fedosyevo was founded. Historians consider the former village of Fedosyevo to be in the center of modern Cherepovets. Several centuries were needed to develop the Fedosyevo into a prominent trade, manufacturing, and regional transportation center. Cherepovets was really founded in 1777 by Catherine the Great and became the center in the administrative structure of the Novgorod Governorate. \nThe construction of the Mariinsk canal system in 1810 made a important impact on the development of Cherepovets. The Mariinsk Canal System connected Cherepovets with the Volga River to the south and the Baltic Sea to the west. At that time, Cherepovets was still at a very early stage of development with a population of 3,000 people by 1863. For a long time, the city brickworks with seven workers was the sole industrial enterprise in Cherepovets.\nThe development of the city changed with bringing more development, and progress after Emancipation Reform happened in 1861 and the appearance of the shipbuilding industry. Cherepovets soon became a prominent shipbuilding and logistics center connecting major regional railways and waterways. In 1915, Cherepovets' population grew to 10,000.\nAfter the revolution of Cherepovets, in March 1918, eastern people of the Novgorod Governorate were renamed to separate Cherepovets Governorate centered around Cherepovets. The new governorate existed for less than 10 years. In 1927, it was merged with Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, and Murmansk Governorates into a single Leningrad Oblast. In September 1937, most of the former Cherepovets Governorate territories (except for Tikhvin district) were transferred to the newly established Russian federal subject of Vologda Oblast.\nAfter the revolution, in March 1918, eastern uyezds of the Novgorod Governorate were renamed to separate Cherepovets Governorate centered around Cherepovets. The new governorate existed for less than 10 years. In 1927, it was merged with Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, and Murmansk Governorates into a single Leningrad Oblast. In September 1937, most of the former Cherepovets Governorate territories (except for Tikhvin district) were transferred to the newly established Vologda Oblast.\nThe subsequent development of Cherepovets is closely related to the completion of the construction of Severstal in 1955, the second-largest of Russia. Unlike the majority of the most important science centers in the Soviet Union, the location of the future steel plant was selected far away from the actual mineral resources and deposits because for that was the many people advantage of having a well-developed infrastructure that allowed connection of the north and northwest of Russia by train, road trip, and water into a single operation system. It connected such remote mining centers as Vorkuta and Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast.\nThe rapid growth of the industry center drastically changed the city, and by the early 1960s, its population exceeded 100,000 people. At 1970, Cherepovets had become the largest city in Vologda Oblast, overtaking Vologda.\nGeography.\nCherepovets is the largest city of the Vologda Oblast. It is 528 kilometers north of Moscow, 537 kilometers east of Saint Petersburg, 631 kilometers northwest of Nizhny Novgorod, 1,705 kilometers northwest of Yekaterinburg, and 135 kilometers slight-southwest of Vologda."}

Her story is from Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur). She has very long hands. The word \"Lai\" means \"deity or divinity,\" \"Khut\" means \"hand,\" and \"Sangbi\" or \"Shangbi\" means \"long\" in Manipuri (Meitei). \nThe legend says that when she walks, her long hands touch the ground. Her fingers are as sharp as thorns. She has a large mouth with a long tongue. Her look is very frightening.\nStory.\nThere was a man and woman with a little child named Shasi (or \"Shachi\" or \"Leirik\" or \"Naocha\" in other versions) living in a house by itself in a village. Nearby was a forest where Lai Khutsangbi lived. She usually stole and ate livestocks and human babies from the village. She took advantage of people's loneliness. The people in the village were afraid.\nLai Khutsangbi wanted to eat the child Shasi. But Shasi's father Shasipa was so brave that the Lau Khutsangbi was afraid of him. One day, Shasipa left home to work somewhere far away. he would be gone for days. Lai Khutsangbi came to the house at night, and asked Shasi's mother Shasima (Shais's Mama) if her husband was at home or not. Shasima was smart, so she lied and said her husband was at home. Lai Khutsangbi left. But she came back night after night and asked the same question again. Shasi's mother also gave the same reply, hiding the fact that Shasipa was away. After some time, Shasi's father returned home and Shasi's mother told him what had happened. Shasi's father decided to defeat the demoness. That night, he waited for Lai Khutsangbi with a sharpened sword. At midnight, the demoness, as usual, came to ask Shasima if her husband was home. This time, Shasi's mother replied that he was away from home. Unaware of the trick, Lai Khutsangbi broke through the wall of the house with one of her powerful hands, trying to find Shasi, the child. Shasi's father, who was waiting for this opportunity, chopped off the hand with his sword.\nThen, the demoness screamed painfully, \n&lt;poem&gt;\nAyo Ema, I am dead! \nAyo yo Ema ayo yo\nLeimadeng deng Ningjaobi\nYou a big liar\nAyo yo Ema ayoyo\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nLai Khutsangbi ran away from the house, dragging her remaining long arm. The blood flew out of her cut arm and fell onto many plants growing on her way to the forest. It is said that the red patches seen on some plants is her blood. Shasi's father followed her into the woods. The demoness could not run fast because she was injured. Shasi's father caught her and stepped on her other remaining hand. Then, he chopped off that arm too.\nThe villagers thanked Shasipa for his bravery. From that day onwards, Lai Khutsangbi, the long handed demoness, was never seen again."}

According to the medieval chronicles, the first settlements of Russia in the area appeared in the 12th century. Kirov was first mentioned as Vyatka for the first time in 1374 when Novgorod ushkuyniks plundered it on their way to Bolghar. Vyatka was governed by a veche as other Northern Russian republics of Pskov Oblast and Novgorod Oblast. At different times in the late 14th and 15th centuries Vyatka militias raided Ustyug, Novgorod and Tatar lands on Kama and Volga. Vyatka supported Yury of Zvenigorod during the Muscovite Civil War and after his party lost the victorious Vasily II sent Muscovite armies twice against Vyatka to subjugate it and eventually it was forced to accept the suzerainty of Moscow while retaining a significant measure of autonomy. In 1469 Vyatka allied with Khan Ibrahim of the Khanate of Kazan and did not take part in the campaign of Ivan III against the khanate.\nAfter several unsuccessful campaigns by Moscow against Vyatka in 1480s, the latter was finally annexed in 1489.\nKhlynov became known throughout Russia for its clay small statues and whistles. Kirov's oldest surviving monument is the Assumption Cathedral (1689), an imposing structure inhabiated by 5 globular domes.\nIn 1780, Catherine the Great renamed the town Vyatka and made it the seat of Vyatka Governorate. Kirov also served as a place of exile, notably for Alexander Herzen, Alexander Vitberg, and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. By the end of the 19th century, it was an important train station on the Trans-Siberian railway.\nIn December 1934, Kirov was renamed after a leader of the Soviet Union, Sergey Kirov, who was assassinated on December 1, 1934.

He is famous for being Sally Hemings' older brother and for being Thomas Jefferson's chef, or head cook, while he was in Paris. Jefferson freed him when he was 30 years old. He died at age 36. He may have killed himself.\nEarly life and family.\nJames Hemings was the son of an enslaved woman called Elizabeth \"Betty\" Hemings and a white man named John Wayles. According to one of her grandchildren, Elizabeth Hemings was Wales' concubine. This means they had a sexual relationship, and she was not his wife.\nAccording to James' nephew, Madison Hemings, Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman who might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include \"Dinah,\" \"Judy,\" \"Abbie,\" \"Sarah,\" \"Parthenia,\" and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named \"Thenia\" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that \"Sally\" is a nickname for \"Sarah,\" and there were many girls named \"Sarah\" and \"Sally\" in the Hemings family too.\nMadison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.\nCaptain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says \"about 1735.\" \nElizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred, until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and many other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayles' house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. In Virginia in the 1700s, many marriage settlements had enslaved people in them. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.\nElizabeth Hemings had 12 children. The father of most of those children, including James, was John Wayles. John Wayles also had children with his wife, Martha Eppes. This made James Hemings the half-brother of Martha Wayles Skelton, who married Thomas Jefferson.\nWhen Martha Wayles Skelton married Jefferson, Hemings and 134 other enslaved people went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. They were part of her own marriage settlement. James Hemings was 9 years old.\nThe Hemings family was the largest family at Monticello. James grew up with his mother, brothers and sisters around him. Unlike other enslaved people, Hemingses did not do much farm work. The women sewed and made clothes. Jefferson hired teachers so the Hemings' boys would learn jobs to do. For example, he paid for Robert Hemings to learn to be a barber.\nHistorian Annette Gordon-Reed wrote that the Hemings brothers did not live the same way as other enslaved men: Jefferson spent a lot of time away from Monticello. He told his white overseers that, while he was away, they should leave the Hemingses alone. Jefferson let James and his brothers go where they wanted so long as they came back when he told them to. James was allowed to look for jobs in Virginia, choose where to work, and keep his money. There are papers showing James Hemings would rent a horse to ride from town to town. But it was Jefferson who made these choices: The law said James Hemings was a slave. It said James Hemings could only do these things because Jefferson said he could.\nRevolutionary War.\nJefferson was elected Governor of Virginia in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War. The capital of Virginia changed. First it was Williamsburg, Virginia and then it was Richmond, Virginia. James and his brother Robert went with Jefferson to Richmond to work for him. When Benedict Arnold led British troops to attack Richmond in 1781, James and Robert took Martha Jefferson and her daughters away from the city.\nFrance.\nWhen Thomas Jefferson went to France to be ambassador, he took James Hemings with him. Because Jefferson was an ambassador, he had to have guests come to his to eat. Those meals had to be very good. Jefferson paid for James Hemings to have cooking lessons from French chefs. One of his teachers was Monsieur Combeaux. Another of his teachers was the same man who cooked for the Prince de Cond\u00e9. After about 19 months, James Hemings had learned enough to lead the kitchen at Jefferson's Paris house. The house was called the H\u00f4tel de Langeac.\nJefferson paid James Hemings 24 livres a month. Hemings spent some of his money on a tutor so he could learn to speak French very well.\nAfter Jefferson had been in Paris for a while, he wanted his other daughter to come live in Paris too. He wrote to his relatives and told them to send this daughter to Paris from Virginia. She was named Maria, but people called her \"Polly.\" James' sister Sally Hemings came with Polly from Virginia. Sally Hemings fourteen when she arrived in Paris and Polly was nine. Sally Hemings stayed as a paid servant at the H\u00f4tel de Langeac. We do not know when Thomas Jefferson began having sex with Sally Hemings, but she was pregnant when she was sixteen years old.\nWhen James Hemings lived in Paris, Jefferson paid him as if he were a free man. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed says this could be because Jefferson did not want anyone to know Hemings was an enslaved person. The laws of France in the 1770s and 1780s did not allow people to keep slaves in France. People who brought slaves to France had to either send them out of the country or free them within a certain time. Enslaved people who knew about this law could go to the admiralty court and ask the French government to say they were free. The judge at the admiralty court for Paris almost always agreed that the person was free. Gordon-Reed says James Hemings could have stayed in Paris if he had wanted to. There were about 1000 black people living in Paris at the time, and French aristocrats liked to employ them. Hemings could have worked as a chef or cook.\nGordon-Reed says that if Hemings had gone to the admiralty court, Jefferson and the United States would have looked bad in front of the French. She also says that if Jefferson had freed the Hemings brother and sister, it would have made Jefferson and the United States look good in front of the French.\nHowever, neither of these two things happened. According to Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson's son, Madison, Sally and James Hemings talked to Jefferson. Jefferson, James Hemings and Sally Hemings made a deal in private: Jefferson promised to free all of Sally Hemings's children, whether he was their father or not. Jefferson promised to free James Hemings after he had taught more people at Monticello how to cook in the French way.\nPhiladelphia.\nJames Hemings came back to America with Jefferson. Soon, Jefferson was made Secretary of State. Again, he needed to have important people over for dinner. James Hemings was his chef. Jefferson paid Hemings the same wage as the free people who worked for him: seven dollars a month. The capital of the United States changed from New York City to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1790. The law of Pennsylvania said that if slave owners brought slaves to Pennsylvania, then those slaves were free after six months. (Enslaved people who ran away to Pennsylvania were not free, even after six months.) James Hemings was in Philidelphia for more than six months. Again, he could have gone to court and asked the judge to say he was a free man if he had wanted to. We do not know why he did not.\nWhile Jefferson and Hemings were in Pennsylvania, Jefferson wrote a contract:\nHaving been at great expence in having James Hemings taught the art of cookery, desiring to befriend him, and to require from him as little in return as possible, I do hereby promise and declare, that if the said James shall go with me to Monticello in the course of the ensuing winter, when I go to reside there myself, and shall there continue until he shall have taught such person as I shall place under him for that purpose to be a good cook, this previous condition being performed, he shall be thereupon made free, and I will thereupon execute all proper instruments to make him free. Given under my hand and seal in the county of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania this 15th. day of September one thousand seven hundred and ninety three.\nThis means:\nBecause I paid so much money for James Hemings to learn to cook and because I want to be nice to him, I promise I will free James Hemings \"if\" he comes back to Virginia with me this winter and teaches someone else to be my cook. As soon as he has done this, I will make him free. I will write and sign whatever papers I need to. I am making this agreement as official as I can. We're making this agreement in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 15, 1793.\nJefferson freed James Hemings in 1796 after he had taught his brother Peter to be a chef.\nLater life.\nJames traveled. He might have gone back to Paris. If he did, he found most of his old friends were dead and the city was very different. Jefferson met him again in Philadelphia.\nJefferson won the United States presidential election of 1800. He wanted James Hemings to come and work for him and be his chef again. He asked a friend to find Hemings in Baltimore and tell him to come north. Hemings sent letters back with the friend, but Jefferson never wrote to James himself. We do not know if Hemings did not want to be President Jefferson's chef or if Jefferson only thought he did not want to. However, James Hemings did work for Jefferson again, at Monticello, in 1801. He was paid $30 for a few weeks of work.\nDeath.\nJames Hemings died in 1801. It is not clear if he killed himself. One idea was that he died from drinking too much. Gordon-Reed says that head chefs who ran kitchens, like James Hemings did, could become alcoholics. This was because chefs were allowed to drink alcohol from the house kitchens. It was also because there was a lot of pressure in the job. Other historians say that a black man, even a free black men, in the late 1700s and early 1800s had a very, very hard life."}

Sometimes, the spacecraft uses the other object to gain speed or to change direction, in an operation called gravity assist. \nSpacecraft that are specially designed for this task are known as flyby spacecraft. Important parameters of a flyby are the time and the distance of the closest approach.\nFlyby maneuvers can be done with a planet, a natural satellite or a non-planetary object such as a small Solar System body.\nPlanetary flybys have occurred with Mars or Earth amongst others. \nKuiper belt.\nThe \"New Horizons\" spacecraft did a fly by the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth on New Year's Day 2019, after its successful flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.\nOn the night of December 31, 2018 to the morning of January 1, 2019 New Horizons performed the most distant flyby to date, of the Kuiper belt object Arrokoth.

Hanuba Hentak!\" is a Meitei folktale originated from Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak).\nStory.\nOnce there was a childless old couple, who used to treat a group of monkeys, from the nearby forest, kindly like their own children. One day, the old couple was planting taro plants (\"paan\" or \"paal\" in Meitei) in their kitchen garden. Seeing that, the monkeys told the two that it was actually not the right way to plant taros. They told the two that the best peeled off tubers of the taros should initially be boiled in a pot until softened and after getting cooled, these should be planted by wrapping in the banana leaves tightly. The old couple believed the monkeys and they did so as suggested. In the midnight, the monkeys relished all the cooked taros from the garden. And in place of all those delicious taros, they uprooted some inedible giant wild taros from somewhere and planted them in the garden. \nIn the next morning, the old couple were surprised at the sudden growth of the taros they had planted the previous day. The two immediately prepared a dish of the recently full grown taros and ate them. But as soon as they gulped some, both felt a tingling sensation in their throat. Unable to bear the allergy, both asked to give \"hentak\" (a traditional edible paste made from fish meat and some vegetables) to each other. It was only after they had the hentak that their allergy was cured. Realising that the monkeys had tricked them, the two devised a plan for revenge. And according to the plan, the old man (\"hanuba\" in Meitei) pretended to be dead, and the old woman (\"hanubi\" in Meitei) cried out loudly to make the monkeys hear her cry. Then, the monkeys came there and asked the old woman what had happened. She told them that the old man died after eating the taros. She asked them to help her taking the old man's body out in the lawn. All the monkeys, unaware of the plan, came inside the house. As soon as they came near the old man, he took up his stick and started beating them. Frightened, they all ran away. The old couple knew that the monkeys would surely come back. So, they climbed up on the attic and hid there. When the monkeys arrived, the attic broke and felt upon them. Thus, they fled the spot. Fearing that they might come back again, the old couple hid inside a large pot. When the monkeys came back, the old man started to fart slowly. Then, the old woman also farted but she did in an uncontrollable way that the pot banged on. The banging sound was too loud that the monkeys fled the spot and never came back.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Hanubi Hentak\", an animation feature film, based on the folktale, was produced by the PUPU FOLKs TV in 2017.\n\"Paan Thaaba\" (\"Planting Taro\"), a play directed by Dr. Usham Rojio, based on the folktale, was premiered in MDU on 15th of August, 2018."}

It makes antibodies.\nAll vertebrates have an adaptive immune system. This protects them against many infections and diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. V(D)J is the basic mechanism. The work is done by developing lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). They make the immune system adaptive. What this means is that the body is able to defend against many infections it has never met before, and the defence gets better against repeat attacks from the same agent. \nThe details are very complex. The system makes sequences of amino acids which bind on to the corresponding sequences of infective agents. The system also recognises \"altered self cells\" as seen in cancer.\nOf course all systems have limits, so when the system fails to recognise a pathogen or cancer, we suffer the consequences.\nIn 1987 Susumu Tonegawa was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for his discovery of the genetic principle for generation of antibody diversity\".\nThe V(D)J refers to the way variable, joining and sometimes diversity regions are produced in the white blood cells. The cells are made in the bone marrow and thymus of vertebrates."}

It wants contemporary R&amp;B, soul and gospel singer and recording artist R. Kelly convicted (meaning found guilty) of sexual abuse, child pornography, kidnapping and obstruction of justice. The movement also wants Kelly to stop receiving money with his singing career.\nFounding.\nThe movement was founded by Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye in 2017. The latter said: \"#MuteRKelly continues until the Black community has fully financially divested from the man and his music and we tackle the overwhelming issue of sexual abuse\". Odeleye was an African American Arts Administrator from Atlanta, Georgia. Barnes is a lobbyist and activist. She also sought to lobby elected officials. She wanted to mobilize activists around the world to encourage users of music streaming platforms to #ThumbItDown, when R. Kelly's music plays. This was in order to change the algorithm of his songs until they are no longer playing.\nAccusations.\nDuring a period of two to three decades, Kelly was accused of sexual abuse of children and adolescents. One example was getting married to then fifteen-year-old R&amp;B and pop singer Aaliyah on August 31, 1994 in Cook County, Illinois. The marriage was dissolved just over five months later at orders from from Aaliyah's family. Aaliyah later admitted she had lied to people about her age.

It lives in many places in the world: Australia, South America, Central America, Africa, southern Asia, some of North America, some of Europe, the Philippines, New Zealand, New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands.\nAppearance.\nThis bird has black and white feathers. Its legs are long and orange. Its bill is straight and black. The irises of its eyes are red. They have gray feathers on their heads. The gray part gets bigger as the bird gets older.\nHabitat and food.\nThis bird lives in mudflats, marshes, and the shores of lakes and rivers.\nThis bird wades. It walks through shallow water on its long legs. It uses its beak to catch small animals with no spines off the top of the water. It can swim and put its head under the water to catch food, but it does not do this often. It eats insects, mollusks, and crustaceans. It can look for food in large flocks, groups of birds. The birds in the flock do not all have to be black-winged stilts. The black-winged stilt will look for food with banded stilts and red-necked avocets too.\nBreeding.\nMany pairs of black-winged stilts build nests near each other. This is called a colony. But each pair will fight other birds if they come too close to their nest. The birds either dig a small hole in the ground or put pieces of plants on the ground to make the nest. Both the male and female stilt sit on the eggs."}

It is mentioned in Sumerian cuneiform texts of around 2300 BC. It lasted to 550 BC as a source of copper and diorite for Mesopotamia.\nLocation.\nHistorians were not always sure where Magan was. Some historians thought Magan could be in part of Yemen called Ma'in in the south of Upper Egypt, in Nubia or the Sudan, and others as part of today's Iran or Pakistan.\nWith the disappearance of trade from the Indus region, the copper from Magan was later replaced by copper imports from ancient Cyprus.\nHistory.\nThe earliest Sumerian text that talks about Magan (Sumerian \ud808\ude23\ud808\udcf6 \"Magan\", Akkadian \"Makkan\") was written during the Umm al-Nar period (2600\u20132000 BCE). It also says \"the Lords of Magan.\" Sumerian texts also talk about \"Tilmun,\" which historians think was in what is Bahrain today, and about \"Meluhha,\" which could be the Indus Valley. The Akkadians fought the Magans in the twenty-third century BCE. This could be why the people built forts. For example, the writers Naram-Sin and Manishtusu, wrote of fighting wars against \"32 lords of Magan.\"\nGudea talks about the devotions to his Temple: \"Magan and Meluhha will come down from their mountains to attend.\" The words Magan (\ud808\ude23\ud808\udcf6) and Meluhha (\ud808\ude28\ud808\ude1b\ud808\udd29) appear vertically in the first column on the right.\nNaram-Sin gave the Akkadian title \"Malek\" to the defeated Ruler of Magan, a title which survives in the Arabic for king, \"malek\".\nThe Magans built good ships and could sail well for the time. King Sargon of Agade (2371\u20132316 BCE) wrote that ships Tilmun, Magan, and Meluhha came to his ports. His successor, Naram-Sin, conquered Magan but he honored the Magan King Manium by naming the city of Manium-Ki in Mesopotamia after him. Trade between the Indus Valley and Sumer went through Magan. However, that trade might have stopped at one time. Ur-Nammu (2113\u20132096 BCE) said he had \"brought back the ships of Magan.\"\nCommerce.\nArchaeological finds from this time show trade not only with the Indus Valley and Sumer but also with Iran and Bactria. They might also show the earliest case of the disease poliomyelitis in the skeleton of a woman from Tell Abraq. The skeleton was found in modern Umm Al Quwain.\nTrade was common between Magan and Ur before the reigns of the Gutian kings over Ur. After they were deposed, Ur-Nammu of Ur restored the roads and trade resumed between the two nations (c. 2100 BC)."}

{"id": "869714", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=869714", "title": "Medusa with the Head of Perseus", "text": "Medusa with the Head of Perseus is a sculpture. Argentine artist Luciano Garbati made it in 2008. It is famous because people in the Me Too movement talked about it. The media called the statue an \"icon of justice\" for people who survived sexual assault. That happened several years after the statue was made.\nMyth.\nMedusa is a Greek myth. In the story, Perseus kills Medusa, not the other way around: Medusa is a monster with a face so terrible that anyone who sees her turns to stone. Medusa lives on an island. The hero Perseus comes to the island to kill Medusa. He cuts off her head and puts it in a bag. He later uses the head to turn his enemies to stone. Perseus then gives Medusa's dead head to the gods. Zeus puts Medusa's head on his shield so it will frighten his enemies.\nAt some point in history, no later than the Roman poet Ovid, another part was added to the myth: Medusa starts as a human priestess and not a monster. She works for the goddess Athena in her temple. She is raped by the god Poseidon in Athena's temple. To the people telling the myth, Medusa, not Poseidon, was the one who had done something bad. Athena punishes Medusa by turning her into an ugly monster: Her hair turns into snakes. Her face becomes terrifying. Only then does Medusa go to the island where Perseus will later kill her.\nMaking.\nIn the 1500s, Benvenuto Cellini made a sculpture called \"Perseus with the Head of Medusa\". In that sculpture, a nearly naked Perseus holds up Medusa's head. Garbati wanted to make that statue in reverse. Garbati did not think he was making feminist art. He only want to \"flip the script\" of the story of Perseus and Medusa. He only wanted to show the sculpture the opposite way.\nGarbati started with clay. He used the clay model to make another sculpture out of resin and fiberglass. Then, he could use the resin sculpture to make copies out of bronze. The sculpture is almost 7 feet tall (about 2 meters). It shows a naked Medusa with a sword in her left hand. She holds a man's head by the hair in her right hand. She stares down and ahead. She looks like a woman and not a monster. Garbati used his own face for Perseus.\nGarbati offered to sell the original resin sculpture for US$35,000 and bronze copies for US$60,000, depending on who made the bronze copy.\nGarbati decided not to copy Cellini's statue exactly. Cellini shows Perseus holding Medusa's head high and smiling. He stands lightly on one foot. Garbati shows Medusa holding Perseus' head low and staring straight ahead. She stands heavily on both feet. Garbati said this was because Perseus coming to attack Medusa meant different things to Perseus and Medusa:\n\"I was thinking of Perseus, this man with all his gadgets, going there and having this victory. This difference between a masculine victory and a feminine one, that was central to my work. The representations of Perseus, he's always showing the fact that he won, showing the head\u2026if you look at my Medusas\u2026she is determined, she had to do what she did because she was defending herself. It\u2019s quite a tragic moment.\"\nAs survivor icon.\nDuring the #MeToo Movement, thousands of women wrote to Garbati saying what the statue meant to them. They said Medusa was a woman who had been raped who fought back.\nCriticism.\nSome people said that black women started the #MeToo Movement, so it was not good to have a statue made by a male artist as its symbol. Garbati answered that he liked that people liked his statue. He also said he'd learned more about patriarchy. Other people asked Garbati why he made Medusa naked and beautiful when she is ugly in the myth. He answered that artists have been showing Medusa as beautiful since the 400s b.c.e. Other people asked why Medusa was holding the head of Perseus and not of the god who raped her, Poseidon. This was because Garbati had not meant to make the statue about rape survivors. He had only meant to do Cellini's statue backwards.\nLocation.\nFor a long time, the statue stayed in Garbati's own art studio in Buenos Aires.\nIn 2020, the statue was shown in New York's Collect Pond Park near the court of criminal justice. This was where Harvey Weinstein stood trial for his crimes. Garbati and helpers started selling small copies of the statue. They gave 10% of the money to the National Women's Law Center."}

He is known for his work for LGBT rights in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Ali was the former media and communications officer at Rasan, he later founded Yeksani, a movement advocating for LGBT rights in the Iraqi Kurdistan. He had also co-founded the first pro-vegan animal rights organization Kurdistan Vegans. He has freelanced for news organizations, focusing on music journalism and political and social issues.\nAli was attacked by the media in a campaign, the campaign was bigger and was against the LGBT community in 2020. After these attacks, he was threatened with murder and assault. The attacks started happening more after Ali did a Global Pride speech on June 27, 2020, organized by InterPride.\nHe criticized Asayish and the Kurdistan Regional Government for an operation which detained LGBT people in Sulaymaniyah. The campaign took place after Asaiysh (local security forces) thought all gay people are sex workers, Ali tried talk about this mistake in a \"Middle East Eye\" interview. Denying that all members of the LGBT community in the Kurdistan region were sex workers, he blamed the government for forcing some into sex work and said that \"prostitution is the last choice to earn a living\".\nPersonal life.\nAli is the youngest of five brothers and sisters. He said in a makanati.net interview that he came out to his mother and older sister in 2017 when he founded Lava Foundation, an unregistered organization working on raising awareness of LGBT issues.\nLike the vast majority of society, my family approached [sexuality] close-mindedly without having any information, they would insult [those who were gay]. When I would spend time with them, sometimes, they would engage in aggressive conversations and hurl insults towards LGBT people. [...] I would leave the room silently because I felt like those insults were directed at me. [...] I tried repeatedly to change and undergo a \"curative treatment\" to no avail. I got to the conclusion that this is me, accepted myself, and moved on. \u2013 Ali, on his experiences with his family and sexuality.\nIn an interview with Queer Film Festival Utrecht, Ali talked about his relationship with his family, reporting that he was disowned and kicked out of the family house when he came out publicly, and receieved death threats from his brother.\nAli has a plant-based lifestyle and co-founded in 2018, one of Iraq's first vegan organizations which focused on environmentalism as well as raising awareness about \"a healthy lifestyle\" at the same time as raising awareness about a vegan lifestyle. A vegan for five years, he had discussed the difficulties of the lifestyle in Iraq; vegan products are scarce, difficult to find, and often overpriced. During an interview, he claimed that before their work at Kurdistan Vegans, there were no dedicated vegan restaurants, but after their advocasy, one was announced in his region.\nCareer.\nActivism.\nAli began his activism in 2017 with Lava Foundation which did not last for a long time, and was hired by Rasan in late 2019; Lava Foundation activities were then carried out in Rasan. After more than a year with Rasan, Ali left the organization and founded Yeksani. Ali's activism focuses on raising awareness of regional LGBT community issues, letting the public know about the community's needs and wants and international actors to encourage action, and normalizing the community in Kurdish society. He emphasizes that LGBT+ living conditions in Kurdistan are poor due to a lack of public awareness.\nGay people should be protected by law and not discriminated against, [homosexuality] is a natural human desire, not an illness. Every workplace should be legally forced to be inclusive to LGBT people in job oppertunities, and even the local security forces need to treat them better. \u2013 Ali to Kurdish news outlet Peregraf in an interview.\nAli mostly uses social media for his activism. He regularly raises awareness about the legal laws used to put LGBT people in jail, and said in a BBC Persian interview that Articles 393, 394, 400, and 401 of Iraqi law are used to illegally detain LGBT people. Ali was also an animal rights activist and a former project manager of Kurdistan Vegans, where he arranged and coordinated World Vegan Day events for two years in a row.\nHe was a journalist with Spee Media, a local independent news outlet. He was focusing there on music journalism, and most of his work featured Wild Fire. He also wrote about conflict in the Middle East, LGBT+ rights in Iraq, and social and civic issues.\nOn May 17, 2020, the European Union (EU), British, and Canadian embassies raised the pride flag in their Baghdad headquarters, which caused a massive backlash, forcing the EU embassy to take down the flag after a few hours. This caused a hate campaign against the LGBT community of Iraq which was supported by visible Iraqi politicians. Ali wrote an extensive report about the progression and worsening situation of LGBT people in Iraq which was hosted on Rasan's website, reporting murder of people precieved to be gay, as well as messages of hate broadcast on national TV. The report was later used for assessments and further studies regarding LGBT rights in the region.\nDuring an interview, Ali discussed the difficulties with being part of the LGBT+ community and finding housing, reporting that many LGBT youth are denied rent or properties are not sold to them, so they are forced to get married to the opposite gender only to have a place to live in. He also talked about how the Directorate of Non-Governmental Organizations have made it impossible to register LGBT organizations in the region.\nAsayish operation.\nOn April 1, 2021, news said that Asayish set checkpoints around Sulaymaniyah and detained some people they thought were gay. Although a lot of people expressed anger on social media at the operation, seventeen members of Sulaimaniyah's Provincial Council signed a petition supporting the arrests. Ali led Take Action, an online campaign through Yeksani which received broad global support, and helped bring the issue to the attention of Amnesty International, the US Consulate in Erbil, Human Rights Watch, ILGA Asia, and other international, national, and local groups. The decision to conduct the operation was influenced by conservative groups in the region, especially the Kurdistan Justice Group.\nAccording to Ali, 15 individuals (some underage) were apprehended by the operation and security checkpoints were set up in places thought to be popular with LGBT people. He said that Asaiysh did not differentiate between LGBT sex workers and other community members or later focused their operation on prostitution to avoid international backlash. Ali highlighted security forces' \"tests\" on suspects to determine if they had sexual contact before their arrests, calling the tests criminal and humiliating. He told \"Middle East Eye\" that \"even if people resorted to sex working, it's the government's fault since it's their last choice of livelihood.\"\nAli repeatedly told the media that community lives were in danger, and he was afraid to be caught at one of the checkpoints since he is openly gay. After local and international pressure from civil-rights organizations and activists, Asayish stopped the operation, released the detainees, and published a statement that they were investigating reports of prostitution in the region and did not \"target any specific groups of society.\"\nDue to discrimination, followed by the operation, Ali reported that many LGBT people (including himself) felt excluded from Kurdish society. Many others also called the operation dehumanizing and criminal. Ali critisized other NGOs that claim to work on LGBT rights, and said \"while they are getting massive funds, they take no action in reality\", and recognized them as symbolic entities.\nRasan lawsuit.\nOn February 22, 2021, it was announced that a lawsuit had been filed against Rasan by an Islamist Kurdistan Justice Group MP because the organization advocated for local LGBT+ rights and this was \"against the values of the Kurdish culture.\" In response to the accusation, Rasan said they would defend themselves against the lawsuit in court and they work for everyone equally. Ali spoke against the MP during a live Rudaw interview, defending the LGBT+ community and saying that the MP's comments were \"baseless and not based on any scientific evidence.\""}

This support was known as \"alimenta.\" The picture shows a Denarius, a Roman coin of the time. On the coin, the words \"ALIM.ITAL.\" can be read. They stand for \"alimenta Italia.\" The coin also shows Abundantia, the goddess of abundance (of food) with her children. \nThe Code of Justinian also talks about alimony.\nSince the 16th century.\nPeople began to pay alimony in the modern way starting in the 16th century: The Latin word \"sustentatio\" was directly translated. The idea was one of the first forms of social security: Family members should support each other, in case of need.\nEnglish church courts awarded alimony in cases of separation and divorce. \"Alimony pendente lite\" was given before the divorce decree, based on the husband's duty to support the wife during a marriage that still continued. Alimony after the divorce was also based on the idea that church courts could not undo a marriage. They could only give a \"divorce a mensa et thoro\", which is similar to a legal separation today. As divorce did not end the marriage, the husband still had to support his wife.\nIn the 19th century, divorce laws were changed, and became more liberal. Divorce was still only possible in the case of marital misconduct. As a result, the requirement to pay alimony became linked to the concept of fault in the divorce. Alimony to wives was paid because it was assumed that the marriage, and the wife's right to support, would have continued but for the misbehavior of the husband. Ending alimony on divorce would have permitted a guilty husband to profit from his own misconduct. In contrast, if the wife committed the misconduct, she was considered to have lost any claim to ongoing support. During this period, parties could rarely afford alimony, and it was rarely awarded by courts. As husbands' incomes increased, and with it the possibility of paying alimony, the awarding of alimony increased, generally because a wife could show a need for ongoing financial support, and the husband had the ability to pay. No-fault divorce led to changes in alimony. Whereas spousal support was considered a right under the fault-based system, it became conditional under the no-fault approach. According to the American Bar Association, marital fault is a \"factor\" in awarding alimony in twenty-five states and the District of Columbia. Permanent alimony began to fall out of favor, as it prevented former spouses from beginning new lives, though in some states (e.g., Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Tennessee), permanent alimony awards continued, but with some limitations. Alimony moved beyond support to permitting the more dependent spouse to become financially independent or to have the same standard of living as during the marriage or common law marriage, though this was not possible in most cases.\nIn the 1970s, the United States Supreme Court ruled against gender bias in alimony awards. That means that men could get alimony from their wives, not only women from husbands. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of male alimony recipients rose from 2.4% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2006. In states like Massachusetts and Louisiana, the salaries of new spouses may be used in determining the alimony paid to the previous partners. Most recently, in several high-profile divorces, women such as Britney Spears, Victoria Principal, and Jessica Simpson have paid multimillion-dollar settlements instead of alimony to ex-husbands. According to divorce lawyers, aggressive pursuit of spousal support by men is becoming more common, as the stigma associated with asking for alimony fades.\nPeople covered.\nToday, most countries have laws about alimony. Usually, the following people are covered:\nNon-monetary support.\nCaring can be in the form of paying money, but it can also be one of the following:"}

Born in Surat (India) in 1918, he joined his father in South Africa in 1927. He was able to learn English in a short time and was a bright pupil. However, he had to leave school at the age of 16 to support his family. He vigorously pursued self-education, including extensive studies on comparative religion, while working in a furniture shop. He was profoundly influenced by observing that, in addition to racial discrimination, the authorities used religious ideology to \u201cnumb the masses,\u201d and that there was a profound misunderstanding of Islam among non- Muslims. He was inspired by the concept of holding interreligious public debates, which he read about in Kairanvi\u2019s book \u201cTruth Revealed\u201d He delivered his first lecture, entitled \u201cMohammad: Messenger of Islam\u201d in a movie theater in Durban, with only 15 people attending. Within a short time, his lectures attracted thousands of people who crossed the racial barrier to listen to him and ask questions.\nWhat distinguished Deedat from his contemporaries was his intensive knowledge of the Bible and Holy scriptures, coupled with his command of English.\nFollowing this tremendous initial success, The 51 Shaikh decided to dedicate his life to the explanation of Islam and promotion of its values. His contributions, especially in the field of comparative religion, extended for more than 40 years and included his authorship of numerous books and manuscripts in addition to hundreds of audio-taped lectures, televised programs and public debates on Islam. Sheikh Deedat almost single-handedly established the As-Salam Center to train propagators of Islam and provide them with theological tools to defend it. He also founded and chaired the Islamic Propagation Center International in Durban, South Africa."}

Therefore, Tafsir of Quran means the explanation or interpretations of the verses of Quran. The Tafsir of Quran is not something done by anyone with ordinary or common intellect and understanding of Islam, rather it is done by people after obtaining extensive knowledge about Islam and reading the history of Islam thoroughly. The objective of a Tafsir is to find out the true meanings of the verses of Quran, so that the audience could benefit from it and know the right and true message of Quran.\nQuran is the word of Allah Almighty, therefore, in order to understand it in the true sense, a person has to sharpen his or her intellectual ability as well as increase the knowledge. When one is at a particular intellectual level, only then can he or she start understanding the true message, which Allah Almighty conveyed through words of Quran. Pertaining to the explanation of Quran for the understanding of general audience, different people have tried to write the Tafsir of Quran. Although Muslims recite Quran and try reading it with translation, however, the reading of Tafsir has its own importance. The lines below discuss what Tafsir is, why is it important and its different kinds.\nImportance of Tafsir.\nThere is a variety of reasons why Tafsir is important and people consult Tafsir when it comes to understanding of Quran.

It can determine where to stop because when y = x, it has reached 45\u00b0. The reason for using these angles is shown in the above picture: As y increases, it does not skip nor repeat any y value until reaching 45\u00b0. So during the while loop, x increments by 1 each iteration, and y decrements by 1 on occasion, never exceeding 1 in one iteration. This changes at 45\u00b0 because that is the point where the tangent is rise=run. Whereas rise&gt;run before and rise&lt;run after.\nThe second part of the problem, the determinant, is far trickier. This determines when to decrement x. It usually comes after drawing the pixels in each iteration, because it never goes below the radius on the first pixel. Because in a continuous function, the function for a sphere is the function for a circle with the radius dependent on z (or whatever the third variable is), it stands to reason that the algorithm for a discrete(voxel) sphere would also rely on this Midpoint circle algorithm. But when looking at a sphere, the integer radius of some adjacent circles is the same, but it is not expected to have the same exact circle adjacent to itself in the same hemisphere. Instead, a circle of the same radius needs a different determinant, to allow the curve to come in slightly closer to the center or extend out farther."}

This idea is called safety in numbers. Related theories show that mass behaviour can reduce accident risks. In the case of traffic safety, the effect really reduces the danger, rather than simply distributing it over a larger group.\nIn biology.\nThe mathematical biologist W.D. Hamilton proposed his selfish herd theory in 1971. This theory tries to explain why animals seek central positions in a group: each individual can reduce its own danger by putting itself in a position with neighbours all around. So it moves towards the centre of the group. The effect was tested in brown fur seal predation by great white sharks. Decoy seals were used, and the distance between them was varied to produce different levels of danger. The seals in greater danger had (as predicted) an increased risk of shark attack. Antipredator adaptations include behaviour such as the flocking of birds, herding of sheep, and schooling of fish. Similarly, before jumping into the water, Adelie penguins wait until their group is large enough: this reduces the risk of seal predation for each penguin in the group. \nThe same result can be seen when predators face a large number of prey animals: the chance of each prey animal surviving is greater.\nIn road traffic safety.\nIn 1949 R. J. Smeed reported that per capita road death rates tended to be lower in countries where more people owned a motor vehicle. This observation led to Smeed's Law.\nIn 2003 P. L. Jacobsen compared rates of walking and cycling, in different countries. Jacobsen looked at the rates of collisions between motorists and cyclists or walkers. He found an inverse relationship. He used a concept called 'behavioural adaptation' to explain this. The concept says that drivers who are exposed to more cyclists on the road begin to drive more safely around them. Though an attractive concept for cycling advocates, it has not been empirically validated. Other combined modelling and empirical evidence suggests that while changes in driver behaviour might still be one way that collision risk per cyclist declines with greater numbers, the effect can be easily produced through simple spatial processes similar to the biological herding processes described above.\nWithout consideringthe other two hypotheses, Jacobsen concluded that \"A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle.\" He described this theory as \"safety in numbers.\"\nSafety in numbers is also used to describe the following evidence: The number of pedestrians or cyclists correlates inversely with the risk of a motorist colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist. This non-linear relationship was first shown at intersections. Ecologic data from cities in California and Denmark, and European countries, as well as time-series data for the United Kingdom and the Netherlands confirmed it. The number of pedestrians or bicyclists injured increases at a slower rate than would be expected based on their numbers. That is, more people walk or cycle where the risk to the individual pedestrian or bicyclist is lower. A 2002 study looked at the question whether pedestrian risk decreased with pedestrian flow. The study used 1983-86 data from signalized intersections in a town in Canada. It found that in some cases pedestrian flow increased where the risk per pedestrian decreased.\nAfter cycling was promoted in Finland, there was a 75% drop in cyclists deaths and the number of trips increased by 72%.\nBetween 2000 and 2008, serious bicycle injuries in England declined by 12%. Over the same period, the number of bicycle trips made in London doubled. Motor vehicle traffic decreased by 16%, bicycle use increased by 28% and cyclist injuries had decreased by 20% in the first year of operation of the London Congestion Charge.\nIn January 2008, the number of cyclists in London that had been treated in hospitals for serious injuries had increased by 100% in six years. Over the same time, they report, the number of cyclists had increased by 84%. In York, comparing the periods 1991-93 and 1996\u201398, the number of bicyclists killed and seriously injured fell by 59%. The percentaghe of trips made by bicycle rose from 15% to 18%.\nIn Germany, between 1975 and 2001, the total number of bicycle trips made in Berlin increased four-fold. Between 1990 and 2007, the percentage of trips made by bicycle increased from 5% to 10%. Between 1992 and 2006, the number of serious bicycle injuries fell by 38%. In Germany as a whole, between 1975 and 1998, cyclist fatalities fell by 66% and the percent of trips made by bicycle rose from 8% to 12%.\nIn America, during the period 1999-2007, the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured decreased by 29% and the amount of cycling in New York city increased by 98%.\nIn Portland, Oregon, between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of workers who commuted to work by bicycle rose from 1.1% to 1.8%. By 2008, the proportion has risen to 6.0%; while the number of workers increased by only 36% between 1990 and 2008, the number of workers commuting by bicycle increased 608%. Between 1992 and 2008, the number of bicyclists crossing four bridges into downtown was measured to have increased 369% between 1992 and 2008. During that same period, the number of reported crashes increased by only 14%.\nIn Copenhagen, Denmark, between 1995 and 2006, the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured fell by 60%. During the same period, cycling increased by 44% and the percent of people cycling to work increased from 31% to 36%.\nIn the Netherlands, between 1980 and 2005, and cyclist fatalities decreased by 58% and cycling increased by 45%.\nDuring 7 years of the 1980s, admissions to hospital of cyclists declined by 5% and cycling in Western Australia increased by 82%."}

Surah Al-Imran has been revealed in Medina.\nName.\nVerses 33 to 35 of this Surah speak of \"Ali-Imran\" or \"Descendants of Imran\". Its name has been considered as a sign. (The correct pronunciation of the name of this surah is 'Ali Imran'). Imran is the grandfather of Isa (AS).\nTime and content of the revelation.\nThe first sermon starts from the first of the sura and continues till verse 32 and it was probably revealed near the battle of Badr.\nThe second speech starts from verse 33 and ends in verse 63 (up to the end of the 6th verse). It was revealed in the 9th Hijri when the Najran delegation arrived.\nThe third speech is from the beginning of the seventh ruku to the end of the twelfth ruku. It was revealed with the first speech.\nThe fourth discourse continues from the thirteenth ruku 'to the end of the surah. It was revealed after the battle of Ohod.\nReason for the revelation.\nThe historical background of the surah is:\nOne: The trials, dangers and crises that the believers of this true religion were warned about earlier in Surah Al-Baqarah took place in full force. Although the believers won the battle of Badr, this battle was like throwing a wheel at Bhimrul. This first armed conflict suddenly shook all the Arab powers that were hostile to this new movement. Signs of a storm were appearing everywhere. There was a constant state of fear and unrest among the Muslims. It seemed, This small settlement of Medina, which has been attacked all over the world, will be wiped off the face of the earth. This situation had a very negative effect on the economic condition of Medina. Medina was a small mooseball town. The settlement was no more than a few show houses. The sudden arrival of a large number of emigrants there. As a result, the economic balance was lost. He was again in danger due to this state of war.\nTwo: The treaty that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made with the Jewish tribes around Medina did not show the slightest respect for that treaty. During the Battle of Badr, all the sympathies of the People of the Book were with the idolatrous polytheists instead of the Muslims who believed in Tawheed and Prophethood and the Book and the Hereafter. After the Battle of Badr, they openly incited the Quraish and other Arab tribes against the Muslims to take revenge. In particular, the chief of the Bani Nadir, Ka'b ibn Ashraf, reduced his opposition to this to the level of blind rivalry. They did not care about the friendship and neighborly relations that these Jews had had with the people of Medina for hundreds of years. Finally, when their misdeeds and breaches of the covenant exceeded the limits, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the most numerous of these Jewish tribes a few months after the Battle of Badr. The wicked 'Bani Kainuka' attacked the tribe and drove them out of the suburbs of Medina. But this only intensified the violence of other Jewish tribes. They conspired with the hypocritical Muslims of Medina and the polytheistic tribes of Hijaz and created innumerable dangers for Islam and Muslims on all sides. Even when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was attacked for his life, this fear was present all the time. At that time the Companions were always armed. Night guards were kept for fear of night raids. If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had been hidden from view for even a short time, the Companions would have gone out to look for him. By conspiring with the tribes, it created innumerable dangers on all sides for Islam and Muslims. Even when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was attacked for his life, this fear was present all the time. At that time the Companions were always armed. Night guards were kept for fear of night raids. If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had been hidden from view for even a short time, the Companions would have gone out to look for him. By conspiring with the tribes, it created innumerable dangers on all sides for Islam and Muslims. Even when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was attacked for his life, this fear was present all the time. At that time the Companions were always armed. Night guards were kept for fear of night raids. If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had been hidden from view for even a short time, the Companions would have gone out to look for him.\nThree: After the defeat of Badr, the fire of revenge was burning in the minds of the Quraish, and the Jews sprinkled kerosene on him. As a result, a year later, a group of three thousand well-equipped soldiers from Medina attacked Medina. This battle took place at the foot of Mount Ohud. That is why it is known as the Battle of Ohod. One thousand people left Madinah with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to take part in this battle. But on the way, three hundred hypocrites suddenly separated and returned to Medina. Among the seven hundred who remained with the Prophet was a small group of hypocrites. During the war, they made every possible effort to create strife among the Muslims. This is the first time that such a large number of sleeve snakes are hidden in the homes of Muslims and they have joined hands with outside enemies to harm their brothers and friends and relatives.\nFour: The defeat of the Muslims in the battle of Uhud was a big part of the strategy of the hypocrites, but the Muslims themselves were no less a part of their weakness. It was only natural that the party, which had just been formed on the basis of a particular ideology and moral system, whose moral training had not yet been completed and whose only second chance to fight for its own beliefs and policies, should show some weakness. Therefore, it was necessary to comment in detail on all these incidents after the war and to point out the weaknesses of the Muslims in the eyes of Islam and to point out the corrections. In this context, it is useful to keep in mind that the Qur'an's commentary on this war is different from what other generals comment on it after their own war!\nVerses: 1: - Alif Lam Meem. 2: - There is no god but Allah, He is the Ever-Living, the Possessor of all things. 3: He has sent down to you the Book with the truth; Which confirms the previous books. 4: - The Torah and the Gospel have been sent down before this Book for the guidance of mankind, and the Revelation has been sent down. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah - for them is a severe punishment. And Allah is Mighty, Avenger. 5: Nothing in the heavens and the earth is hidden from Allah. 6: He is the God who shapes you in the womb as He wills. There is no god but He. He is the Almighty, the Wise. 6: He is the One who sent down the Book to you. There are some clear verses in it, they are the real part of the book. And the others are metaphorical. So those who have crookedness in their hearts, They follow the metaphors in them for the purpose of spreading sedition and misinterpretation. And no one knows their interpretation except Allah. And those who are deep in knowledge say: We believe in it. All this is a revelation from our Lord. And no one receives education except those who are endowed with understanding. 6: Our Lord! Thou wilt not lead our hearts astray after Our guidance, and bestow on us grace from Thee. You are the giver of everything. 9: Our Lord! You will surely bring people together one day - there is no doubt about it. GOD does not fulfill His promise. 10: Those who disbelieve, their wealth and their children will not avail them aught against Allah. And they are the fuel of Hell. 11: The people of Pharaoh and those before them denied My revelations. As a result, GOD seized them for their sins, and GOD's retribution was severe. 12: Tell the disbelievers that you will soon be defeated and driven to Hell. What a miserable position. 13: Surely there was a sign for you between the two parties. A party fights in the way of Allah. And the other party was the disbelievers, who saw them with their own eyes. And whom Allah strengthens with His help. In the meantime, there are lessons for those who have vision. 14: - Mankind has been fascinated by women, children, zodiac gold and silver, marked horses, cattle and farms. All these are the consumables of worldly life. The best refuge is with God. 15: - Say, Shall I tell you to seek better than this? For those who guard (against evil), with Allah is Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever. And pure companions, and the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is ever watchful over His servants."}

Surah An-Nisa has been revealed in Medina . This surah talks about how Muslims should lead their lives and stay united.\nTime and content of the revelation.\nThis Surah is the sum of several speeches. Probably from the end of the third Hijri to the end of the fourth Hijri or from the beginning of the fifth Hijri, different parts of it were revealed at different times. Although it is not possible to say exactly from which verse to which verse a revelation was included in a speech and what was the time of its revelation, some provisions and events have been pointed out somewhere to help us know the date of their revelation from tradition. . So with the help of these we can point out a general limit of these speeches containing these provisions and hints.\nAs we know, the provisions regarding the distribution of inheritance and the rights of orphans were revealed after the battle of Uhud. Then seventy Muslims were martyred. As a result of this incident, the question arose as to how the inheritance of the martyrs would be distributed in different houses of the small settlements of Medina and how the interests of the orphans they had left would be preserved. On the basis of this, we can assume that the first four verses, and the first three verses of the fifth verse will have been revealed at this time.\nWe find in the hadith the tradition of reciting the prayer of fear (praying while fighting) in the battle of Jatur Rika. This battle took place in the fourth Hijri. So it can be inferred here that the speech (15 Ruku) in which the rules of prayer have been explained will have been revealed in the near future.\nBani Nadir was expelled from Medina in the month of Rabiul Awwal of the fourth Hijri. Therefore, the last warning given to the Jews in this speech, \"Believe me before I disfigure your face,\" can be presumed to have been revealed at a very near time.\nTayammum was allowed due to lack of water during the battle of Banil Mustaliq. And this battle took place in the fifth Hijri. Therefore, it should be remembered that the speech in which (7th Ruku) mentioned Tayammum was revealed at that time."}

It has been called by this name merely to distinguish it from other Surahs.\nTime of revelation.\nThis Surah was revealed at the end of 6 AH or at the beginning of 6 AH after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah . This is clear from the subject matter of the Surah and the various narrations of the Hadith also prove its authenticity. The event of the month of Zilqad in the sixth Hijri. Fourteen, with Muslims the Prophet Muhammad Umrah to perform there has arisen. But the Quraish disbelievers, out of enmity, completely opposed the oldest religious tradition in Arabia and did not allow him to perform Umrah . After much debate and debate, they agreed that next year you can come to visit the house of God. At this time, on the one hand, the Muslims had a KaabaIt was necessary to explain the rules of pilgrimage for the purpose of pilgrimage, so that the Umrah could be performed with full Islamic dignity next year, and on the other hand, it was necessary to urge them to respond to the excesses of the infidel enemies by not allowing them to perform Umrah. Let them take the lead, so that they may not again oppress the disbelievers. Because Hajj to many disbelieving tribesThe tour had to go through Muslim-dominated areas. In the same way that the Muslims were not allowed to visit the Ka'bah, they could have forcibly blocked the way of visiting the Ka'bah of these disbelieving tribes. This is the context in which the introductory speech at the beginning of this Surah is discussed. This issue has been raised again in the front thirteen ruku's. This proves that the same speech continues from the first ruku to the fourteenth ruku. In addition, all the other contents we find in this Surah seem to be of the same period\nThe continuity of the narration suggests that this entire surah is included in a single discourse and that it was probably revealed at the same time. Again, some of its verses may have been revealed later separately and due to the unity of content, they have been included in different places of this Surah. But nowhere in the continuity of narration is the slightest emptiness felt. As a result, there is no time to think of it as the sum of two or three speeches."}

This Surah was revealed in Makkah . This Surah Allah's Oneness, punarutthana, Heaven and Hell have been discussed.\nName.\nIn this Surah, in the 16th and 18th Ruku, the imaginary and superstitious idea of \u200b\u200bthe Arabs regarding the prohibition of some An'am (domesticated animals) and the halal of some of them has been refuted. In this context, this Surah has been named Al An'am.\nTime of revelation.\nAccording to Ibn 'Abbas, this entire Surah was revealed in Makkah at the same time. Hazrat Asma bint Yazid , the cousin of Hazrat Muaz Ibn Jabal , said that this Surah was revealed while the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was riding on a camel. Then I was holding the reins of her camel. Under the weight of the burden, the camel's condition had reached such a level that it seemed as if this understanding would break her bones. It is also clearly stated in the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recorded this Surah on the night it was revealed.\nIf we think about its subject matter, it is clear that this Surah would have been revealed towards the end of the Meccan period. The narration of Hazrat Asma bint Yazid also proves this to be true. Because he belonged to the Ansar. After the migration he converted to Islam. If he had attended the service of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Makkah out of sheer devotion before accepting Islam, he would surely have been in the last year of his stay in Makkah. Earlier, his relationship with the people of Yasreb was not so close that one of their women could come to his service."}

This Surah was revealed in Makkah . The central theme of this Surah is the call to believe in the Prophethood.\nName.\nIn verses 46 and 48 of this surah (in the fifth verse) the Araf or the people of Araf are mentioned in the Companions. That is why it is named Al Araf. In other words, the meaning of calling this Surah Surah Al-A'raf is that it is the Surah in which A'raf is mentioned.\nTime of revelation.\nLooking at the subject matter of this Surah, it is clear that this Surah was revealed at about the same time as Surah An-Amr . Of course, it cannot be said with certainty whether it was revealed before or after An'am. However, from the eloquence of the speech given in this Surah, it is clear that it is related to that time. Therefore, in order to understand its historical background, it is enough to take a look at the introduction written at the beginning of Surah An-Nam."}

Murad won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for this book.\nSynopsis.\nIn the first part of the book, Murad writes about growing up in the Yazidi village of Kocho, Sinjar District. She lived there with her mother, two older sisters and eight older brothers. Murad writes about several disputes with nearby Sunni villages and terrorist attacks that she remembered. She then talks about the August 2014 occupation of Kocho by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. During the occupation, ISIS people killed many people in Kocho in a massacre. Some of the people of Kocho ran away to the Sinjar Mountains, and the rest were kidnapped by ISIS. The ISIS agents told the men still in Kocho that they had to change religions. The men of Kocho said no, and the ISIS agents killed them. Young women were kidnapped as sexual slaves. Murad criticized Peshmerga troops for running away from Kocho one day before the massacre.\nIn the second part of the book, Murad tells the readers about what happened to her during the Second Iraqi Civil War. ISIS agents took her and other women to an place in Solagh. She was then taken to Mosul, which had been captured by ISIS in June 2014. Yazidi women who weren't enslaved were attacked by anyone who wanted to hurt them. A high-ranking militant wanted to buy Murad, but she convinced a skinnier judge to buy her instead. When Murad was in Al-Hamdaniya District, she tried attempted to escape through a window. The guards who caught her raped her and sent her away to an ISIS checkpoint. She was imprisoned there and raped by people passing. Then she was bought by someone in Mosul again. There, she successfully and easily escaped that man, who had left the front door unlocked. She said that was miraculous.\nIn the third part of the book, Murad talks about how she escaped from ISIS-held territory. First, she walked around Mosul for almost two hours. Then she saw a family and asked them for help. They agreed to help her run away. Murad used fake identities to escaped with the family's younger son. The family sent him away with Murad so he would not join ISIS. Murad and the sun entered Iraqi Kurdistan, but they kept their fake identities so that no one would use Murad's status as a former slave for political reasons. Murad found she could not leave Sulaymaniyah, so she Murad decided to tell her story to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The PUK gave the interview to the media, even though they had said they wouldn't. This meant that the family who had helped Murad in Mosul were in danger. Murad found some people from her family, and she waited to learn about the rest. Her mother had been killed in Solagh, and Nadia's niece Kathrine, who had tried to escape six times, had been killed in the same explosion blast that injured Lamiya Aji Bashar. Six of Murad's brothers had been killed, and one of her nephews had become an ISIS soldier.\nRelease.\nMurad's attorney is Amal Clooney, a Lebanese-British barrister. Clooney wrote the foreword to \"The Last Girl\".\n\"The Last Girl\" was released for sale in the UK, Germany and Netherlands at the same time: on October 31, 2017. Rights to print the book were sold in twenty other territories. According to the Associated Press, Murad noted in a statement \"that she had lost numerous friends and family members to ISIS and hoped her story would 'influence world leaders to act. The book was released right after the October 2017 Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict.\nCritical reception.\nWriting for \"The Washington Post\", Alia Malek said that Murad \"writes with understandable anger but also with love, flashes of humor and dignity\". Ian Birrell wrote for \"The Times\" that Jenna Krajeski, the American journalist who wrote the book with Murad, \"captures Murad's tremulous voice well\".\nAnna Della Subin of \"The New York Times\" said the book was good to read because people could learn about Yazidi religious beliefs. Ashutosh Bhardwaj wrote for the Indian newspaper \"The Financial Express\" that Murad's book \"vividly details the customs and life of Yazidism\" and that she \"cites instances how the Yazidi stories were misinterpreted by the Sunnis who termed them 'devil worshippers.\nCritics focused on the fact that the Iraq conflict was still happening when the book was published. Subin wrote that the book is \"difficult to process\", that it has \"open wounds and painful lessons\", and that almost anyone with almost any political ideas could pretend that Murad agreed with them. Subin also wrote that \"it places Murad's tragedy in the larger narrative of Iraqi history and American intervention\". According to Subin, the book is \"intricate in historical context\". Murad wrote it that way to avoid sensationalism and Islamophobia. Malek had \"[no] doubt [that] controlling her story was part of [Murad's] motivation to tell it in this book\". However, Malek also said that Murad harshly criticized Sunni Arabs for not standing up to ISIS even though some of them did. Murad called them exceptions.\nThe \"Evening Standard\" Arifa Akbar wrote that the book \"initially defers its shock\", being \"a history lesson\" about the time ISIL killed many Yazidis and about her family's life. Akbar said that later parts of the book \"deliver true horror, and a surreal sense of Murad's parallel existence as a sex slave in a city filled with ordinary Sunni Muslim families\". Malek wrote: \"She takes the time to introduce Kocho and its people before the arrival of the Islamic State. [...] So when the Islamic State strikes, we know that these are real people \u2014 and we know that the stakes are high and the devastation is visceral.\" Bhardwaj wrote that something Murad's said, that the rest of the world is more interested in the sexual abuse aspect of the genocide than in the rest of it, was \"[perhaps] her most damning comment\" and that \"[her] account [reflects] the collective guilt of civilisation\".\nMalek ended her review with: \"Nonetheless, Murad gives us a window on the atrocities that destroyed her family and nearly wiped out her vulnerable community. This is a courageous memoir that serves as an important step toward holding to account those who committed horrific crimes.\" Birrell wrote that the last part of the book was \"slightly rushed\". He finished his review with: \"It is not always easy to turn the pages as Murad descends into hell. But this is an important book by a brave woman, fresh testament to humankind\u2019s potential for chilling and inexplicable evil. Perhaps the ultimate tragedy is that this joins a packed library of similar tomes from the past.\""}

It lives in New Zealand.\nAppearance.\nThis bird has black feathers and long legs.\nHabitat and food.\nThe black stilt lives next to rivers and lakes, in swamps and by ponds. It goes to rivers, streams, or swamps to lay eggs. It goes further inland for the winter. But because these areas are usually close to each other, scientists do not think of it as a migratory bird.\nThis bird wades into the water to look for food.\nThreats.\nAs of 2021 there were about 170 of these birds alive in the wild. In 1981, there were only 23 birds. There are fewer of them because of invasive species, animals that humans brought to New Zealand. Cats and ferrets kill many stilts, chicks, and eggs. Human beings also change the places where the birds like to live. Human beings using the seashore for work or fun can scare the adult birds away from the nests. They can accidentally kill the chicks or eggs.\nThe Kak\u012b Recovery Programme keeps some breeding pairs. They put the eggs in incubators until they hatch. They raise the chicks by hand until they are too big for cats or ferrets to eat easily. They also take eggs from wild nests. That way, predators cannot eat the parents as they sit on the nest.\nIn some parts of New Zealand, for example Tasman River, human beings try to stop the predators from eating the birds. It has worked."}

Historians do not know if she was a real person or a legend. If she did live, it was probably between the 5th and 12th centuries. The earliest piece of writing that talks about her is the Gesta Danorum.\nWhen Alfhild was a young princess, the room she slept in was guarded by a lizard and a snake. These reptiles scared away suitors who were not brave. A Danish prince named Alf, who was also Geatish, came to Geatland and fought the animal guards and won. But Alfhild's mother told her to run away from Alf dressed as a man. She did, and she became a woman fighter called a shield maiden. \nShe found a group of pirate ships that had lost their captain. She became the captain and made the other women part of the sailing crew. The crew doubled in number.\nShe was so good at piracy that she hurt a large part of the Danish and Finnish shipping economy. She also sailed to Iceland once. Prince Alf then went to stop the fleet. At that time, he did not know that Alfhild was pirate leader. He found them off the coast of Finland. \nIn the original story, Alfhild killed Alf, the latter underestimating the fleet's power, and then put his head on a spear and continued pirating. People know this from Norse hearsay in dining halls. \nIn Christian story, she knocked off his helmet. This made her recognize him, and she stopped pirating and married Alf. She then became queen of Denmark. This version is probably wrong: It agreed with the things Christianity and patriarchy saw as good.\nIn popular culture.\nThere are some differences in the story in later popular culture. Here Alfhild is almost always called Awilda. (Other spellings: \"Alwilda, Alvilda, Alvild, Alvilde, Alfhilda, Avilda, Alvida, Altilda, \u00c6lfhild\").\nDuring the 1800s, Alfhild/Awilda was a popular subject for scrimshaw carved by sailors on whaling ships.\nThe story about Alf And Alfhild has also been made into Italian operas.\nIn 1686, \"\"L'Amazzone Corsara, ovvero L'Alvilda, regina de Goti\",\" by Carlo Pallavicino."}

It existed from the 1980s, to the early 2000s. Credonia Mwerinde and Joseph Kibweteere founded it. They said the virgin Mary had appeared to them. The group split from the Roman Catholic Church. The group wanted to restore the Ten Commandments. They said that only by strictly following the Ten Commandments would they be saved. \nIn 1998, the group was first noticed, because they made children work in a school they operated. There was also a very bad hygiene at that school. \nThere was the text \"A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Time,\" which they considered to be their gospel. Each group member was expected to have read it at least six times. The teachings of the group were that those worthy of salvation would be saved, but that all the others would be punished. Credonia Mwerinde was seen as the incarnation of the Virgin Mary. \nAccording to the group, the world would end on 31st December 1999. When the world did not end that day, people became suspicious. They wanted their posessions back, which they had transferred to the group beforehand. According to survivers, people who asked to get their possessions back would mysteriously disappear. The first 530 followers died at a religious service, in a church, on 17th March 2000. The leaders of the cult had the doors nailed shut. Then they poured petrol on the wooden church, and put in on fire. Today, it is certain that Joseph Kibweteere was not among the dead in the church. He was seen alive, the following day. During the following days, several bodies were discovered on the farms of the group. In total, over 1.000 people died.\nMedical examinations later determined that the majority of dead sect members had been poisoned. Early reports suggested that they had been strangled based on the presence of twisted banana fibers around their necks. After searching all sites, the police concluded that earlier estimates of nearly a thousand dead had been exaggerated, even though the final death toll was 924.\nAfter interviews and an investigation, the police ruled out a cult suicide, and instead consider it to be a mass murder by the Movement leadership. They believe that the failure of the doomsday prophecy led to a revolt in the ranks of the sect, and the leaders set a new date with a plan to kill their followers. The discovery of bodies at other sites, the fact the church had been boarded up, the presence of incendiaries, and the possible disappearance of sect leaders all point to this theory. Additionally, witnesses said the Movement leadership had never spoken of mass suicide when preparing members for the end of the world. A survivor recalled meeting a devout member of the cult with nails and a hammer on his way after he had left the cult. It is believed he is the one who shut the windows with nails to prevent any one from escaping.\nThe Ugandan government condemned the killings. President Yoweri Museveni called the event a \"mass murder by these priests for monetary gain\". Vice president Dr. Speciosa Wandira Kazibwe said, \"These were [...] well-orchestrated mass murders [carried out] by a network of diabolic, malevolent criminals masquerading as religious people.\"\nAt the start, the five leaders were believed to have died in the fire. Police now believe that Joseph Kibweteere and Credonia Mwerinde may still be alive, and have issued an international warrant for their arrest. In 2014, the Uganda National Police announced that there were reports that Kibweteere was hiding in Malawi."}

{"id": "870876", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=870876", "title": "History of the Catholic Church", "text": "The history of the Catholic Church is the formation, events, and change of the Catholic Church through time.\nThe Catholic Church began with Jesus Christ and his teachings. It is a continuation of the early Christian community established by the Disciples of Jesus. The Church believes its bishops to be the successors to Jesus's apostles and the Church's leader, the Bishop of Rome (also known as the Pope), to be the only successor to Saint Peter who ministered in Rome in the first century AD after his appointment by Jesus as head of the Church.\nChristianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, with all persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. In 313, the persecutions were lessened by the Edict of Milan with the legalization of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In 380, under Emperor Theodosius, Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the Edict of Thessalonica.\nThe battles of Toulouse preserved the Christian west against the Umayyad Muslim army, even though Rome itself was destroyed in 850, and Constantinople attacked. In the 11th century, already difficult relations between the mostly Greek church in the East, and the Latin church in the West, developed into the East-West Schism, partially due to conflicts over the Pope's authority. Before and during the 16th century, the Church started a process of reform and renewal. Reform during the 16th century is known as the Counter-Reformation. In later centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world even though it experienced a reduction of European believers due to the growth of Protestantism and also because of religious doubt and distrust during and after the Enlightenment. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s introduced the most big changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent four centuries before.\nChurch beginnings.\nEarly organization.\nAccording to Catholic tradition, the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ. The New Testament narrates about Jesus' activities, teaching, his appointment of the twelve Apostles, and his instructions to them to continue his work. The Catholic Church teaches that Pentocost signaled the beginning of the public ministry of the Church. In this event, the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles.\nAccording to the Catholic Church, Christ desginated Peter as the \"rock\" upon which he would build his church. Catholics hold that Saint Peter was Rome's first bishop. He started the unbroken line which includes the current pontiff, Pope Francis. That is, the Catholic Church maintains the apostolic succession of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, who is the successor to Saint Peter.\nConditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways allowed easier travel. Also, the Pax Romana made it safe to travel from one region to another. The government had encouraged inhabitants to learn Greek. Having a common language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed. Jesus's apostles gained converts in Jewish communities around the Mediterranean Sea. They established over 40 Christian communities by 100. Although most of these were in the Roman Empire, notable Christian communities were also established in Armenia, Iran and along the Indian Malabar Coast. The new religion was most successful in urban areas and it spread first among slaves and people of low social standing, and then among aristocratic women.\nAt first, Christians continued to worship alongside Jewish believers. However, twenty years after Jesus's death, Sunday was being regarded as the primary day of worship.\nChristianity established itself as a separate religion when preachers such as Paul of Tarsus began converting Gentiles . To solve doctrinal differences, around year 50 the apostles gathered in the first Church council, the Council of Jerusalem. This council affirmed that Gentiles could become Christians without adopting all of the Mosaic Law.\nThe early Christian Church was not very organized. This resulted in diverse interpretations of Christian beliefs. To have more consistency, by the end of the 2nd century Christian communities had developed a more structured hierarchy. The organization of the Church began to mimic that of the Empire. The churches in Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome were the most important. To solve problems about doctrine or policy, bishops often congregated in regional synods. This happened from the beginning of the 2nd century. By the 3r century, the bishop of Rome began to be asked about problems that other bishops could not resolve. \nInfluential theologians, named Church Fathers, refined the doctrine. From the year 100, some teachers such as Ignatius of Antioch and Irenaeus defined Catholic teaching. This was done by opposing them to opposed them to Gnosticism.\nTheological apologists consolidated teachings and traditons. Among them we can find Pope Clement I and Augustine of Hippo.\nPersecutions.\nChristianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods. This was adopted from Judaism and was different from most religions in the Roman Empire.\nAs Christians refuse to join pagan celebrations, they weren't able to take part in much of public life. This caused non-Christians to fear that Christians were angering the gods (this meant a threat to the peace and prosperity of the Empire).\nDue to its secrecy, Christians were accused of practising incest and cannibalism.\nIn the 3rd century, Christians were persecuted by order of the emperors. They hold them responsible for the Empire's crises. All residents were ordered to give sacrifices or be punished. Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Jewish Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000. Many fled or renounced their beliefs. \nIn spite of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted. This led to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in 313. By 380, Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman Empire.\nLate antiquity.\nWhen Constantine became emperor of the Western Roman Empire in 312, he attributed his victory to the Christian God. Many soldiers in his army were Christians, and his army was his base of power. With Licinius, (Eastern Roman emperor), he issued the Edict of Milan which mandated toleration of all religions in the empire. The edict had little effect on the attitudes of the people. New laws were issued to codify some Christian beliefs and practices. \nConstantine's biggest effect on Christianity was his patronage:\nThese gifts and later ones combined made the Church the largest landowner in the West by the 6th century.\nIn a reflection of their increased power in the Empire, clergy began to adopt the dress of the royal household.\nDuring Constantine's reign, more or less half of the Christians Christian did not subscribe to the official church. Constantine feared that disunity would displease God, so he eliminated some sects. To resolve other disputes, Constantine began the practice of calling ecumenical councils. These councils determined obligatory interpretations of Church doctrine.\nDecisions made at the Council of Nicea (325) about the divinity of Christ led to a schism. The new religion, Arianism flourished outside the Roman Empire. Partially to distinguish themselves from Arians, Catholic devotion to Mary became more important. This was the cause to further schisms.\nIn 380, mainstream Christianity (as opposed to Arianism) became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Christianity became more associated with the Empire. This was the reason why Christians living outside of the empire were persecuted, becasuse their rulers feared they would revolt in favor of the Emperor. In 385, capital punishment was first used upon a Christian 'heretic', namely Priscillian. \nDuring this period, the Bible as we know it today was first officially arranged in Church Councils or Synods. This was done through the process of official 'canonization'. Prior to these Councils or Synods, the Bible had already reached a form that was nearly identical to its current one:\nThe Council of Ephesus in 431 declared that Jesus was both fully man and fully God. Two decades later, the Council of Chalcedon solidified Roman papal primacy. This added to continuing breakdown in relations between Rome and Constantinople, the seat of the Eastern Church. The Monophysite disagreements over the precise nature of the incarnation of Jesus led to the first of the various Oriental Orthodox Churches breaking away from the Catholic Church.\nMiddle Ages.\nEarly Middle Ages.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, trinitarian Christianity and Arian Christianity competed for the conversion of the barbarian tribes. The 496 conversion of Clovis I, pagan king of the Franks, saw the beginning of a steady rise of the faith in the West.\nIn 530, Saint Benedict wrote his Rule of St Benedict as a practical guide for monastic community life. Its message spread to monasteries throughout Europe. Monasteries became major conduits of civilization. They preserved craft and artistic skills and maintained intellectual culture. They functioned as spiritual , agricultural, economic and production centers. During this period the Visigoths and Lombards moved away from Arianism for Catholicism. Pope Gregory the Great reformed the ecclesiastical structures and administration. Then, he launched renewed missionary efforts. Missionaries such as Augustine of Canterbury, who was sent to begin the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, others took Christianity into northern Europe. They spread Catholicism among the Germanic, and Slavic peoples. The Synod of Whitby of 664 was decisive for the reintegration of the Celtic Church of the British Isles into the Roman hierarchy. And in Italy, the 728 Donation of Sutri and the 756 Donation of Pepin left the papacy in charge a sizable kingdom. The Donation of Constantine further consolidated the papal position over the western part of the former Roman Empire.\nIn the early 8th century, Byzantine iconoclasm became a major source of conflict between the Eastern and Western parts of the Church. Byzantine emperors prohibited the creation and veneration of religious images. They saw them as violations of the Ten Commandments. Pope Gregory III vehemently disagreed. A new Empress Irene siding with the pope, called for an Ecumenical Council. In 787, the fathers of the Second Council of Nicaea \"warmly received the papal delegates and his message\". At the conclusion, 300 bishops, who were led by the representatives of Pope Hadrian I \"adopted the Pope's teaching\", in favor of icons.\nThe papacy acquired a new protector in the West with the coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III in 800 and the handing over of the keys to the Tomb of Saint Peter. This freed the pontiffs from the power of the emperor in Constantinople. However, it also led to a schism, because the emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople interpreted themselves as the true descendants of the Roman Empire. Pope Nicholas I had refused to recognize Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople, who in turn had attacked the pope as a heretic. This was because he kept the filioque in the creed, which referred to the Holy Spirit emanating from God the Father and the Son. The papacy was strengthened through this new alliance, which in the long term created a new problem for the Popes. This was that, in the Investiture controversy, succeeding emperors sought to appoint bishops and even future popes. After the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire and repeated incursions of Islamic forces into Italy, the papacy, without any protection, entered a phase of major weakness.\nHigh Middle Ages.\nThe Cluniac reform of monasteries that began in 910 placed abbots under the direct control of the pope rather than the secular control of feudal lords. This eliminated a major source of corruption and sparked a great monastic renewal. Monasteries, convents and cathedrals still operated all schools and libraries. They also often functioned as credit establishments promoting economic growth. After 1100, some older cathedral schools were divided into:\nDuring the 11th century, the East\u2013West schism divided Christianity forever. It started with a dispute on whether Constantinople or Rome held jurisdiction over the church in Sicily. This led to mutual excommunications in 1054. The Western (Latin) branch of Christianity has since become known as the Catholic Church. The Eastern (Greek) branch became known as the Orthodox Church. The Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439) both failed to heal the schism. Some Eastern churches have since reunited with the Catholic Church, and others claim never to have been out of communion with the pope. Officially, the two churches remain in schism, although excommunications were mutually lifted in 1965.\nThe 11th century saw the Investiture controversy between Emperor and Pope over the right to make church appointments. This was the first major phase of the struggle between Church and state in medieval Europe. The Papacy were the initial victors. However, Italians divided between Guelphs and Ghibellines in factions that lasted until the end of the Middle Ages. The dispute gradually weakened the Papacy, not least by drawing it into politics.\nPope Urban II started the First Crusade in 1095 when he received an appeal from Byzantine emperor Alexius I to help repel a Turkish invasion. Urban believed that a Crusade might help bring about reconciliation with Eastern Christianity. Encouraged by reports of Muslim atrocities against Christians, a series of military campaigns began in 1096. They were known as the Crusades. They were intended to return the Holy Land to Christian control. The goal was not permanently realized. Also, the Crusades left a legacy of mutual distrust between Muslims and Western and Eastern Christians. The sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade left Eastern Christians resentful. In 2001, Pope John Paul II apologized to the Orthodox Christians for the sins of Catholics including the sacking of Constantinople in 1204.\nTwo new orders of architecture emerged from the Church of this era. The earlier Romanesque style combined massive walls, rounded arches and ceilings of masonry. To compensate for the absence of large windows, interiors were painted with scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. Later, the Basilique Saint-Denis marked a new trend in cathedral building when it utilized Gothic architecture. In other developments, the 12th century saw the founding of eight new monastic orders. Many of them functioned as Military Knights of the Crusades. Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux had great influence over the new orders and produced reforms to ensure purity of purpose. His influence led Pope Alexander III to begin reforms that would lead to the establishment of canon law. In the following century, new mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzm\u00e1n which brought consecrated religious life into urban settings.\nCatharism grew in Languedoc in the 12th-century. The Inquisition originated during the period of struggle against this heresy. After the Cathars were accused of murdering a papal legate in 1208, Pope Innocent III declared the Albigensian Crusade. Abuses committed during the crusade caused Innocent III to informally institute the first papal inquisition to prevent future massacres and root out the remaining Cathars. Formalized under Gregory IX, this Medieval inquisition executed an average of three people per year for heresy at its height. Over time, other inquisitions were launched by the Church or secular rulers. Its main objectives were to prosecute heretics, to respond to the threat of Moorish invasion or for political purposes. The accused were encouraged to renounce their heresy and those who did not could be punished by penance, fines, imprisonment or execution by burning.\nA growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France. This period was known as the Avignon Papacy. The papacy returned to Rome in 1378 at the urging of Catherine of Siena and others who felt the See of Peter should be in the Roman church. With the death of Pope Gregory XI later that year, the papal election was disputed between supporters of Italian and French-backed candidates. This led to the Western Schism. For 38 years, separate claimants to the papal throne sat in Rome and Avignon. Efforts at resolution further complicated the issue when a third compromise pope was elected in 1409. The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the Council of Constance. There, the cardinals asked all three claimants to the papal throne to resign, and held a new election naming Martin V pope.\nRenaissance and reforms.\nDiscoveries and missionaries.\nIn the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Pope Alexander VI, in the papal bull Inter caetera, awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal. Under the patronato system, state authorities controlled clerical appointments and no direct contact was allowed with the Vatican. In December 1511, the Dominican friar Antonio de Montesinos openly rebuked the Spanish authorities governing Hispaniola for their mistreatment of the American natives, telling them \"... you are in mortal sin ... for the cruelty and tyranny you use in dealing with these innocent people\". King Ferdinand enacted the Laws of Burgos and Valladolid in response. Enforcement was lax, and while some blame the Church for not doing enough while others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples. The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th-century Spain.\nIn 1521, through the leadership and preaching of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the first Catholics were baptized in what became the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia, the Philippines. The following year, Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico, and sought to convert the Indians and to provide for their well-being by establishing schools and hospitals. They taught the Indians better farming methods, and easier ways of weaving and making pottery. Because some people questioned whether the Indians were truly human and deserved baptism, Pope Paul III in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or Sublimis Deus (1537) confirmed that the Indians were deserving people. Afterward, the conversion effort gained momentum. Over the next 150 years, the missions expanded into southwestern North America. In India, Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among non-Christians and a Christian community which claimed to have been established by Thomas the Apostle.\nEuropean Renaissance.\nIn Europe, the Renaissance marked a period of renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. It also brought a re-examination of accepted beliefs. Cathedrals and churches had long served as picture books and art galleries for millions of the uneducated. The Church sponsored great Renaissance artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Although Church leaders were able to promote Renaissance humanism, there were also conflicts between clerics and humanists. In 1509, a well known scholar of the age, Erasmus, wrote The Praise of Folly, a work which captured a widely held unease about corruption in the Church. The Papacy itself was questioned by conciliarism expressed in the councils of Constance and the Basel. Real reforms during these ecumenical councils and the Fifth Lateran Council were attempted several times but prevented. They were seen as necessary but did not succeed in large measure because of internal feuds, ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Saracenes and the simony and nepotism practiced in the Renaissance Church of the 15th and early 16th centuries. As a result, rich, powerful and worldly men like Roderigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI) were able to win election to the papacy.\nReformation era wars.\nThe Fifth Lateran Council issued some but only minor reforms in March 1517. A few months later, on 31 October 1517, Martin Luther posted his Ninety-Five Theses in public, hoping to spark debate. His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences. Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and others also criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges, supported by powerful political forces in the region, developed into the Protestant Reformation. During this era, many people emigrated from their homes to areas which tolerated or practiced their faith.\nIn Germany, the Reformation led to war between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 . However, continued tensions produced a far graver conflict, the Thirty Years' War, which broke out in 1618. In the Netherlands, the wars of the Counter-Reformation were the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years' War. \nIn France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots and the forces of the French Catholic League. A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League. This ended under Pope Clement VIII, who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes, which granted civil and religious toleration to Protestants. In 1565, several hundred Huguenot shipwreck survivors surrendered to the Spanish in Florida, believing they would be treated well. Although a Catholic minority in their party was spared, all of the rest were executed for heresy, with active clerical participation.\nEngland.\nThe English Reformation was based on Henry VIII's desire for annulment of his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. It was initially more of a political, and later a theological dispute. The Acts of Supremacy made the English monarch head of the English church thereby establishing the Church of England. Then, beginning in 1536, some 825 monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were dissolved and Catholic churches were confiscated.When he died in 1547 all monasteries, friaries, convents of nuns and shrines were destroyed or dissolved. Mary I of England reunited the Church of England with Rome and persecuted Protestants during the Marian Persecutions. After some provocation, the following monarch, Elizabeth I enforced the Act of Supremacy. This prevented Catholics from becoming members of professions, holding public office, voting or educating their children. Executions of Catholics and dissenting Protestants under Elizabeth I, who reigned much longer, then surpassed the Marian persecutions and persisted under the following English monarchs. Elizabeth I also executed other Penal laws were also enacted in Ireland but were less effective than in England. In part because the Irish people associated Catholicism with nationhood and national identity, they resisted persistent English efforts to eliminate the Catholic Church.\nCouncil of Trent.\nThe Council of Trent (1545\u20131563) became the driving-force of the Counter-Reformation, and reaffirmed central Catholic doctrines such as transubstantiation, and the need for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. It also reformed many other areas of importance to the Church. It did so by improving the education of the clergy and consolidating the central jurisdiction of the Roman Curia.\nThe criticisms of the Reformation were among factors that sparked new religious orders including the Jesuits, which became the great missionary order of later years. Spiritual renewal and reform were inspired by many new saints like Teresa of Avila, Francis de Sales and Philip Neri. Their writings spawned distinct schools of spirituality within the Church (Oratorians, Carmelites, Salesian), etc. Improvement to the education of the laity was another positive effect of the era. To popularize Counter-Reformation teachings, the Church encouraged the Baroque style. Baroque religious expression was stirring and emotional, created to stimulate religious fervor.\nElsewhere, Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier introduced the Catholic Church in Japan. Church growth came to a halt in 1597 under the Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi who, in an effort to isolate the country from foreign influences, launched a severe persecution of Christians. Japanese were forbidden to leave the country and Europeans were forbidden to enter. Despite this, a minority Christian population survived into the 19th century when Japan opened more to outside influence, and they continue to the present day.\nBaroque, Enlightenment and revolutions.\nMarian devotions.\nThe Council of Trent generated a revival of religious life and Marian devotions in the Catholic Church. During the Reformation, the Church had defended its Marian beliefs against Protestant views. \nPope Paul V and Gregory XV ruled in 1617 and 1622 to be inadmissible to state, that the virgin was conceived non-immaculate. Supporting the belief that the virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception was preserved free from all stain of original sin (aka Immaculate Conception) Alexander VII declared in 1661, that the soul of Mary was free from original sin. Pope Clement XI ordered the feast of the Immaculata for the whole Church in 1708. The feast of the Rosary was introduced in 1716, the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The Angelus prayer was strongly supported by Pope Benedict XIII in 1724 and by Pope Benedict XIV in 1742. Popular Marian piety was even more colourful and varied than ever before: Numerous Marian pilgrimages, Marian Salve devotions, new Marian litanies, Marian theatre plays, Marian hymns, Marian processions. Marian fraternities, today mostly defunct, had millions of members.\nEnlightenment secularism.\nThe Enlightenment constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the Protestant Reformation, the enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally, it elevated human reason above divine revelation. It also and down-graded religious authorities such as the papacy based on it.\nToward the latter part of the 17th century, Pope Innocent XI saw increasing Turkish attacks against Europe as a threat for the Church. He built a Polish-Austrian coalition for the Turkish defeat at Vienna in 1683. Innocent X and Clement XI fought against Jansenism and Gallicanism. Both supported Conciliarism, and rejected papal primacy. This weakened the Church's ability to respond to gallicanist thinkers such as Denis Diderot, who challenged fundamental doctrines of the Church.\nIn 1685 gallicanist King Louis XIV of France issued the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, ending a century of religious toleration. France forced Catholic theologians to support conciliarism and deny Papal infallibility. The king threatened Pope Innocent XI with a general council and a military take-over of the Papal state. The absolute French State used Gallicanism to gain control of virtually all major Church appointments as well as many of the Church's properties. State authority over the Church became popular in other countries as well. In Belgium and Germany, Gallicanism appeared in the form of Febronianism. Emperor Joseph II of Austria (1780\u20131790) practiced Josephinism. He regulated Church life, appointments, and massive confiscation of Church properties. The 18th century is also the time of the Catholic Enlightenment, a multi-faceted reform movement.\nFrench Revolution and the Church in France until 1940.\nThe anti-clericalism of the French Revolution promoted the nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a state-run church. Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the National Assembly, leading to the Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of \"Reason\" but it never gained popularity. In this period, all monasteries were destroyed, 30,000 priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed. When Pope Pius VI sided against the revolution in the First Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy. The 82-year-old pope was taken as a prisoner to France in February 1798 and soon died. To win popular support for his rule, Napoleon re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The church lands were never returned, however the priests and other religious were given salaries by the government, which maintained church properties through tax revenues. Catholics were allowed to continue some of their schools. The end of the Napoleonic wars, signaled by the Congress of Vienna, brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States to the pope; the Jesuits were restored.\nFrance remained basically Catholic. The Revolution failed to destroy the Catholic Church, and Napoleon's concordat of 1801 restored its status. The return of the Bourbons in 1814 brought back many rich nobles and landowners who supported the Church. However, few new priests were trained in the 1790\u20131814 period, and many left the church. The result was that the number of parish clergy plunged from 60,000 in 1790 to 25,000 in 1815, many of them elderly. Entire regions, especially around Paris, were left with few priests. On the other hand, some traditional regions held fast to the faith, led by local nobles and historic families. The comeback was slow\u2014very slow in the larger cities and industrial areas. With systematic missionary work and support from Napoleon III, there was a comeback. Conservative Catholics held control of the national government, 1820\u20131830. However, most often played secondary political roles or had to fight the assault from republicans, liberals, socialists and seculars.\nThroughout the lifetime of the Third Republic there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were linked to the Monarchists. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church as a political threat to republicanism and progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the church represented outmoded traditions, superstition and monarchism. The Republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support. Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. Napoleon's 1801 Concordat continued in operation but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.\nThe 1882 school laws of Republican Jules Ferry set up a national system of public schools that taught strict puritanical morality but no religion. For a while privately funded Catholic schools were tolerated. Civil marriage became compulsory, divorce was introduced and chaplains were removed from the army.\nWhen Leo XIII became pope in 1878 he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884 he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner to the State. In 1892 he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in Republican politics. This attempt at improving the relationship failed. Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the Dreyfus Affair. Catholics were for the most part anti-dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal La Croix. This infuriated Republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry (1899\u20131902) and the Combes Ministry (1902\u201305) fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals (1903\u201304), and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs (1904). Combes as Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to thoroughly defeat Catholicism. He closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty four orders were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain.[190] In 1905 the 1801 Concordat was abrogated; Church and State were finally separated. All Church property was confiscated. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches. In practise, Masses and rituals continued. The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests. In the long run, however, it gained autonomy\u2014for the State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops and Gallicanism was dead.\nIndustrial age.\nFirst Vatican Council.\nBefore the council, in 1854 Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The majority of Catholic Bishops supported this decision. Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.\nDuring First Vatican Council, some 108 council fathers requested to add the words \"Immaculate Virgin\" to the Hail Mary. Some fathers asked to includethe dogma of the Immaculate Conception in the Creed of the Church. This was opposed by Pius IX. It was also strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially from Germany. Many French Catholics wished that the Council declared Papal infallibility and the assumption of Mary dogma. In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility. Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a very small breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church.\nSocial teachings.\nThe Industrial Revolution brought many concerns about the deteriorating conditions of urban workers. In 1891 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Rerum novarum. It was set in context Catholic social teaching: it rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions. Rerum novarum argued for the establishment of a living wage and the right of workers to form trade unions.\nQuadragesimo anno was issued by Pope Pius XI, on 15 May 1931, 40 years after Rerum novarum. Unlike Leo, who addressed mainly the condition of workers, Pius XI concentrated on the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He called for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. He noted major dangers for human freedom and dignity, arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism.\nThe social teachings of Pope Pius XII repeat these teachings. He applies them not only to workers and owners of capital, but also to other professions and all aspects of life. Going beyond Pius XI, he also defined social teachings in other areas such as medicine, psychology, sport, television, science, law and education. The dominant concern was the continued rights and dignity of the individual. With the beginning of the space age at the end of his pontificate, Pius XII explored the social implications of space exploration and satellites asking for a new sense of community and solidarity.\nMariology.\nPopes have always highlighted the link between the Virgin Mary as Mother of God and the full acceptance of Jesus Christ as Son of God. Since the 19th century, they were very important for the development of mariology to explain the veneration of Mary. Before the 19th century, Popes promulgated Marian veneration in different ways such as authorizing new Marian feast days, prayers, initiatives, the acceptance and support of Marian congregations. Since the 19th century, Popes begin to use encyclicals more frequently. Thus Leo XIII, the Rosary Pope issued eleven Marian encyclicals. Recent Popes promulgated the veneration of the Blessed Virgin with two dogmas:\nPius XII also promulgated the new feast Queenship of Mary celebrating Mary as Queen of Heaven and he introduced the first ever Marian year in 1954, a second one was proclaimed by John Paul II. Pius IX, Pius XI and Pius XII facilitated the veneration of Marian apparitions such as in Lourdes and F\u00e1tima. Later Popes such from John XXIII to Benedict XVI promoted the visit to Marian shrines (Benedict XVI in 2007 and 2008). The Second Vatican Council highlighted the importance of Marian veneration in Lumen gentium. During the Council, Paul VI proclaimed Mary to be the Mother of the Church.\nAnti-clericalism.\nThe 20th century saw the rise of various politically radical and anti-clerical governments. The 1926 Calles Law separating church and state in Mexico led to the Cristero War. In it, over 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated, churches desecrated, services mocked, nuns raped and captured priests shot. In the Soviet Union following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, persecution of the Church and Catholics continued well into the 1930s. In addition to the execution and exiling of clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of religious implements and closure of churches was common. During the 1936\u201339 Spanish Civil War, the Catholic hierarchy supported Francisco Franco's rebel Nationalist forces against the Popular Front government. This was due to the Republican violence directed against the Church.\nWorld War II.\nAfter the Second World War began in September 1939, the Church condemned the invasion of Poland and the following 1940 Nazi invasions. In the Holocaust, Pope Pius XII directed the Church hierarchy to help protect Jews and Gypsies from the Nazis. While Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews, the Church has also been accused of antisemitism. Other commentators have accused Pius of not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. Debate over the validity of these criticisms continues to this day.\nPost-Industrial age.\nSecond Vatican Council.\nThe Catholic Church started a reformation process after the Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365). Intended as a continuation of Vatican I, under Pope John XXIII the council developed into an engine of modernisation. Its main task was double:\nOther reforms decided at the Second Vatican Council were:\nCatholicism today.\nCatholic-Orthodox dialogue.\nIn June 2004, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I's visited Rome. This happened on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (29 June). Its scope was another personal meeting with Pope John Paul II, for conversations with the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.\nThe Patriarch's partial participation in the Eucharistic liturgy followed the program of the past visits of Patriarch Dimitrios (1987) and Patriarch Bartholomew I himself:\nThe Patriarch did not fully participate in the Liturgy of the Eucharist involving the consecration and distribution of the Eucharist itself.\nIn accordance with the Catholic Church's practice of including the Filioque clause when reciting the Creed in Latin, but not when reciting the Creed in Greek, Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have recited the Nicene Creed jointly with Patriarchs Demetrius I and Bartholomew I in Greek without the Filioque clause.\nThe declaration of Ravenna in 2007 re-asserted these beliefs, and re-stated the notion that the bishop of Rome is indeed the protos, although future discussions are to be held on the concrete ecclesiological exercise of papal primacy.\nBenedict XVI.\nWith the election of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, the Church largely saw a continuation of the policies of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. However, there were some notable exceptions: Benedict decentralized beatifications and reverted the decision of his predecessor regarding papal elections. In 2007, he set a Church record by approving the beatification of 498 Spanish Martyrs. His first encyclical Deus caritas est discussed love and sex in continued opposition to several other views on sexuality. \nFrancis.\nFollowing the resignation of Benedict, Pope Francis was elected pope 2013. He is the current and first Jesuit pope, the first pope from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. Since his election to the papacy, he has displayed a simpler and less formal approach to the office, choosing to reside in the Vatican guesthouse rather than the papal residence. "}

It is also called Sigheh. Unlike Nik\u0101\u1e25, which is the other form of marriage in Islamic law, a Nikah mut'ah marriage does not last for the two people's whole lives. It lasts only limited time. Nikah mutah is about sexual pleasure. The Twelver Shia Muslims say that Nikah mut'ah is legal, but most other Muslims disagree. \nConditions.\nSome things must be true for a Nikah mut'ah:\nNikah mut'ah is different from the other form of marriage in other ways too:\nNikah mut'ah does not have to be publicly announced. Islam says that Muslim men may have only four and no more, but this only applies to Nikah-marriages.\nAccording to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Nikah mut'ah is the only way a Muslim can marry a person of the Book who is not Muslim. He says Nikah is not possible with non-Muslims. Other Ayatollahs say that Muslims can marry non-Muslim people of the book. \nCriticism.\nNikah mut'ah has been used to cover child prostitution. Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah is similar to prostitution. Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution allowed by the Twelver Shia authorities. She quotes the Oxford encyclopedia of modern Islamic world to make a difference between marriage (nikah) and mut'ah. She also says that while nikah is for having children, mut'ah is just for sexual gratification."}

It is the story about the saving of the endangered Meitei horse (Manipuri pony) and empowering women in the sport of polo () at the same time.\nThe movie shows how the Manipuri women moves forward in a male dominated sportive society. It also shows the development of the special relationship with their Meitei horses (Manipuri ponies). They are trying at their best levels to participate in the annual polo tournament. \nThe movie begins from Sagol Kangjei (), the ancient polo as a wartime peace exercise in Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur). And it ended up with the present day advancements of the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association. It produces cultural, ecological, historical and social relationship between the sport, the horses and the ethnicity of the land.\nBackground.\nThe polo started in the far corner of the North East India (Ancient Manipur). It has been developed there for many centuries. At the same time, Women's empowerment has been very active in the history of Manipur. Roopa Barua, the maker of the \"Daughters of the Polo God\", took interest in these facts. So, she set her project on it. She said, \n\"A young polo sisterhood is developing in Manipur that ploughs on in spite of adversity and political turmoil. They are intensely connected to their sacred Manipuri pony and play an international tournament every year. My film is a tribute to these polo players, the modern Manipuri women and the pony campaign.\"\nShe spoke to the media that Manipuri girls are empowered a lot and have been able to play and do well for themselves. Before the beginning of the journey, the polo girls offered prayers to Marjing, the \"Polo God\" of Meitei religion, at his temple. And so, the name of the movie is also taken from the sense that the polo player girls are the daughters of their beloved father like Polo God of their own ethnic religion. Notably, it took over four years to complete the making of the movie.\nAwards.\nThe movie gets 6 international awards at 5 International Film Festivals. These are held at different countries of the world.\nReception.\nThe Equus Festival takes its winning films on a film tour across North American and European countries.

It was called \"Occidental\" between 1922 and 1947. Edgar de Wahl, one of the first Esperantists, created it. De Wahl was from the city of Tallinn in Estonia, which was in the Russian Empire but later became its own country. He spoke German, Russian, Estonian and French since he was a child and had natural ability in languages. He is often called \"de Wahl\".\nInterlingue looks a lot like languages in the Romance language family: French, Spanish, Italian, and so on. De Wahl made a rule called De Wahl's rule that made changing verbs to nouns easier and more regular. For example, the word exploder (to explode) regularly changes its d to s (making explosion) when following this rule.\nAlphabet and pronunciation.\nInterlingue is written with 26 Latin letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. The letters of the alphabet are pronounced as \"a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha, i, jot, ka, el, em, en, o, pe, qu, er, es, te, u, ve, duplic ve, ix, ypsilon\", and \"zet\". Accents are written on the five vowels to indicate irregular stress, with the acute accent (\u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa) preferred, but others (\u00e8, \u00ea, etc.) permitted.\nThe vowels are usually pronounced as follows:\nThe consonants are pronounced as in English, with the following exceptions:\nOther doubled consonants are pronounced as a single consonant, unless when separated they would be pronounced differently. Ex. grammatica is pronounced as if written gramatica, but occidental and suggestion are pronounced as if written as oc followed by cidental, and sug followed by gestion.\nArticle.\nLike English, Interlingue has a definite article and an indefinite article. The definite article (the) is \"li\", and the indefinite (a, an) is \"un\". Plural of a noun is made by adding \"-s\" after a vowel, or \"-es\" after most consonants. To avoid pronunciation and stress changes, words ending in -c, -g, and -m only add an -s: un libre, du libres, un angul, tri angules, li tric, li trics, li plug, li plugs, li album, pluri albums, li tram, du trams.\nThe ending of the definite article can be modified to lo (masculine), la (feminine), lu (neuter), lis (plural), los (masculine plural), e las (feminine plural). Of these, the forms lu and lis are most common: lu in the same sense as Spanish \"lo\" and English \"that which\", as in Ne li aprension de un lingue es lu essential, ma su usation (\"that which\" is essential is not the learning of a language, but using it), and lis to change to plural words that are difficult to make plural on their own: lis s (the s's).\nPersonal pronouns.\nInterlingue has two forms for the personal pronouns: one for the subject form (nominative), and one for the object form (accusative or dative).\nGrammatical endings are used, but less than in Esperanto and Ido in which parts of speech are marked with obligatory endings. Only a few parts of speech (such as verb infinitives) in Interlingue have entirely obligatory endings, while many others either have endings the usage of which is optional and sometimes recommended. Some grammatical endings are:\nCorrelatives.\nNotes on the correlatives:\nAlcun (some) and necun (no, none) are respectively the adjectives of alquel and nequel.\nThe -qui series has optional accusative forms ending in -em: quem, alquem, nequem.\nThe -al series is adverbialized with the -men ending: qualmen (how) talmen (that way).\nCorrelatives can take the plural ending: queles, quales, tis, omnis, etc.\nCi (here) and ta (there) can be affixed to ti and to to indicate proximity or distance: ti libre (this book), ti-ci libre (this book here), ti-ta libre (that book there), tis (these), tis-ci (these here), tis-ta (those there), to-ci (this here), to-ta (that there).\nMany derivatives are formed from the correlatives: qualit\u00e1 from qual + it\u00e1, quantit\u00e1 from quant + -it\u00e1, omnipotent from omni + potent.\nVerbs.\nVerbs in Interlingue have three endings: -ar, -er, and -ir. Conjugation is performed with a combination of endings and auxiliary verbs. The verb esser (to be) is exceptional in being written es in the present tense, though the esse form is seen in the imperative.\nAdverbs.\nInterlingue has primary adverbs and derived adverbs. Primary adverbs are adverbs without special endings: \"tre\" (very), \"sempre\" (always), etc.\nDerived adverbs are adverbs made by putting -men at the end of an adjective (rapid = quick, rapidmen = quickly). This is similar to \"-ment\" in French, \"-mente\" in Italian, and other Romance languages. The ending \"-men\" was inspired by Proven\u00e7al and spoken French (which does not pronounce the t in \"-ment\") and chosen over \"-mente\" to avoid clashing with the noun ending \"-ment\" and other nouns in the language derived from the past tense in -t. The ending may be omitted when the meaning is clear: tu deve far it rapid(men) = you must do it quick(ly).\nDr. F. Haas in 1956 grouped the most common adverbs by type as below."}

It was called \"Occidental\" between 1922 and 1947. Edgar de Wahl, one of the first Esperantists, created it. De Wahl was from the city of Tallinn in Estonia, which was in the Russian Empire but later became its own country. He spoke German, Russian, Estonian and French since he was a child and had natural ability in languages. He is often called \"de Wahl\".\nDe Wahl was not happy with Esperanto. He decided to create a language called \"Occidental\". He published it in 1922. In 1949 the name of the language was changed to \"Interlingue\".\nAfter a period in which the language was almost dead (between 1950 and 1990), the Internet helped Interlingue revive.\nHow Occidental (Interlingue) started.\nBecause de Wahl announced his language in the magazine Kosmoglott in 1922, this is where the Occidental activities can be seen. However, de Wahl started making the language long before this. In between 1906 and 1921 he started experimenting with his own language, and it changed a lot. At the time he called it Auli, or \"auxiliary language\" (auxiliary means helpful). The other nickname for Auli is proto-Occidental (which means \"old Occidental\"). When de Wahl announced his language in 1922, it was almost but not quite done. He actually wanted to wait a bit longer, but there was big news in 1921: the League of Nations was looking at the idea of an international language. De Wahl had also sent a letter and got a positive reply from the League of Nations in September 1921.\nOccidental began having followers because it was easy to read and understand, despite a complete lack of grammars and dictionaries. Two years later in 1924, de Wahl wrote that he was exchanging letters with 30 people \"in good Occidental\" despite the lack of learning material.\n\"Kosmoglott\" was also a forum for various other planned languages, while still mainly written in Occidental. The name was changed to \"Cosmoglotta\" in 1927 as it began to officially promote Occidental instead of other languages, and in January of the same year the magazine's editorial and administrative office was moved to Vienna in the region of Mauer, now part of Liesing. Much of the early success for Occidental in this period came from the office's new central location, along with the efforts of Engelbert Pigal, also from Austria, whose article \"Li Ovre de Edgar de Wahl\" (The Work of Edgar de Wahl) led to interest in Occidental from users of the Ido language. By early 1930, the language was spoken in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and most recently in France where it began to be used two years before.\nVienna period and World War II.\nWhen the magazine Cosmoglotta was based in Vienna, the users of the language had enough money for the first time and were in a city with a convenient location. Two important supporters were Hans H\u00f6rbiger, also from Vienna, and G.A. Moore from London, from which \"\"Cosmoglotta\" was able to live without difficulty and gained a circle of readers despite the economic crisis\". But H\u00f6rbiger and Moore both died in 1931, so this period did not last long. After this \"Cosmoglotta\" had to find money from other places: subscriptions, books, magazines, and so on.\nThe growing movement began a more strong and self-confident campaign for the language in the early 1930s in which it took advantage of its easy way to be understood at first sight. They contacted organizations such as companies, embassies and printing houses using letters completely in Occidental that were often understood and responded to, were produced at this time as well to introduce the idea of an international language and support Occidental as the answer to Europe's \"tower of Babel\". Recordings of spoken Occidental on gramophone records for distribution also began to be made in this period.\nThe years 1935 to 1939 were even more active. This is when \"Cosmoglotta\" started publishing a second edition. First it had the name \"Cosmoglotta-Informationes\", but was soon called \"Cosmoglotta B.\" Cosmoglotta B had more discussions that were interesting to the users of Occidental such as the language's development, Occidental in the news, and how much money they had.\nMeanwhile, the years leading up to World War II led to problems for Occidental and other planned languages which were made illegal in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, forced to break up, kept watched over by Gestapo, and had their educational materials destroyed. The prohibition of auxiliary languages in Germany was especially damaging as this was where most Occidentalists lived at the time. The inability to accept payment for subscriptions was a financial blow, and a difficulty that continued after the war along with Germany's division into zones of influence. No communication happened between de Wahl in Tallinn and the Occidental Union in Switzerland from 1939 to October 1947, first due to the war itself and after that from intercepted mail between Switzerland and the Soviet Union. Not knowing this, de Wahl was confused at the lack of response to his continued letters and even a large collection of translated poetry into Occidental which were never delivered; the only letter of his received in Switzerland was one that arrived in 1947 asking the Occidental Union \"why it never responded to any letters from Tallinn\". Meanwhile, de Wahl's house and his whole library had been destroyed during the bombardment of Tallinn. De Wahl himself was in jail for a time after refusing to leave Estonia for Germany, and later hid in a psychiatric hospital where he lived during his final years.\nThe sudden start of war in 1939 stop the publications of both Cosmoglottas extending into 1940, but in 1941 Cosmoglotta B began publication once again and continued until 1950. An edition of either Cosmoglotta A or B was published every month between January 1937 and September 1939, and then (after the first shock of the war) every month from September 1941 to June 1951. During the wartime period, only those in neutral Switzerland and Sweden were able to fully work on the language, carrying on activities in a semi-official form.\nDuring the war, Occidentalists saw that the language was often permitted to be sent by telegram within and outside of Switzerland (especially to and from Sweden)[58] even without official recognition, guessing that censors were able to understand it[59] and may have thought them to be written in Spanish or Romansch,[60] a minor yet official language in Switzerland that at the time dind't have a standardized orthography. This allowed a certain amount of communication to take place between the Occidentalists in Switzerland and Sweden. The other centres of Occidental activity in Europe did not continue, with the stocks of study materials in Vienna and Tallinn having been destroyed in bombings[61] and numerous Occidentalists sent to concentration camps in Germany and Czechoslovakia.[62][63] Contacts were reestablished shortly after the war by those who remained, with letters from countries such as France, Czechoslovakia, Finland and Great Britain reaching Cosmoglotta by users informing the editorial office that they were ready to begin activities again for the language.[64][65] Cosmoglotta had subscribers in 58 cities in Switzerland[66] a few months before the end of World War II in Europe, and Cosmoglotta A began publication again in 1946.[42]\nSetting up the language standard.\nOne of these activities was language standardization.[45] De Wahl had created Occidental with some unchangeable features, but believed that its following of the \"laws of life\" gave it a firm enough base that it could follow a \"natural evolution\"[46] with a flexibility which would \"allow time and practice to take care of modifications that would prove to be necessary\".[47] As a result, some words had more than one allowed form and could not be settled by decree alone, thus leaving the ultimate decision to the community by including both possible forms in the first Occidental dictionaries.[48] One example concerned the verb scrir (to write) and a possible other form scripter, as both created internationally recognizable derivations: scritura and scritor from scrir, or scriptura and scriptor from scripter.[49] De Wahl expressed a preference for scrir, finding scripter to be somewhat heavy, but commented that the latter was certainly permissible and that Occidental might take on a similar evolution to natural languages in which both forms come into common use, with the longer form having a heavier and formal character and the shorter form a lighter and more everyday tone (such as English story vs. history).[49]\nOrthography was another area in which several possibilities existed: etymologic orthography (adtractiv, obpression), historic orthography (attractiv, oppression), or simplified orthography (atractiv, opression).[50] Simplified orthography became the standard by 1939.[51] Much of the standardization of the language took place in this way through community preference (e.g. both ac[52] and anc were proposed for the word \"also\" but the community quickly settled on anc), but not all. With questions still remaining about the official form of some words and a lack of general material destined for the general public,[53] much time during World War II was spent on language standardization and course creation, and in August 1943 the decision was made, given the length of the war, to create an interim academy to officialize this process.[45] This process had just about begun not long before the war, and the Swiss Occidentalists, finding themselves isolated from the rest of the continent, opted to concentrate on didactic materials to have prepared by the time the war reached its end.[54][55] While doing so, they frequently found themselves confronted with the decision between two \"theoretically equally good\" forms that had remained in popular usage, but whose presence could be confusing to a new learner of the language.[56] The academy maintained that standardization efforts were based on actual usage, stating that \"...the standardization of the language has natural limits. 'Standardizing' the language does not mean randomly randomly one of the possible solutions and rejecting the others as indesirable and irritating. One only standardizes solutions that have already been sanctioned through practice.\"[57]\nIALA, Interlingua, and name change to Interlingue.\nThe International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), founded in 1924[67] to study and decide the best planned language for international communication, was at first viewed with disbelief by the Occidental community. The co-founder Alice Vanderbilt Morris was an Esperantist, as were many of its staff members,[68] and many Occidentalists including de Wahl himself[68] believed that its leadership under Esperantist William Edward Collinson (known among readers of Cosmoglotta for an article of his entitled \"Some weak points of Occidental\")[69] meant that it had been set up with a staff of professional language experts under a neutral and scientific pretext to help a final recommendation for Esperanto. Relations soon improved, however, as it became clear that the IALA intended to be as impartial as possible by familiarizing itself with all existing planned languages. Ric Berger, a prominent Occidentalist who later joined Interlingua in the 1950s, described one such visit he made in 1935 to Morris (whose husband was the US representative in Brussels) that hugely improved his opinion of the organization:\nAs a result, opinions in the Occidental community of the IALA and its activities began to improve and reports on its activities in Cosmoglotta became more and more positive. In 1945, the IALA announced that it planned to create its own language and showed four possible versions under consideration, all of which were naturalistic[71] as opposed to schematic. Occidentalists were pleased that the IALA had decided to create a language so almost the same in nature to Occidental, seeing it as a credible association that gave weight to their argument that an auxiliary language should proceed from study of natural languages instead of attempting to fit them into an artificial system. Ric Berger was particularly positive in describing the language the IALA was creating as a victory for the natural school (\"Li naturalit\u00e1 esset victoriosi!\")[71] and \"almost the same language\" in 1948,[72] though was not without reservations, doubting whether a project with such a almost the same aspect and structure would be able to \"suddenly cause prejudices [against planned languages] to fall and create unity among the partisans of international languages\"[73] and fearing that it might simply \"disperse the partisans of the natural language with nothing to show for it\" after Occidental had created \"unity in the naturalistic school\" for so long.[73]\nWhile the two languages had a 90% identical vocabulary[74] without orthographic differences taken into account (e.g. with filosofie and philosophia considered the same word), they were very different with regards to structure and derivation. De Wahl's Rule in Occidental had eliminated Latin double stem verbs (verbs such as act: ager, act- or send: mitter, miss-), while Interlingua simply accepted them as an important part of a naturalistic system.[75] The control languages (Italian, Spanish and/or Portuguese, French, English) used by Interlingua to form its vocabulary for the most part require an eligible word to be found in three source languages (the \"rule of three\"),[76] which would conflict with Occidental's Germanic substrate and various other words which would be by definition ineligible in a unified language that retained Interlingua's methodology. Accepting Occidental words such as mann, strax, old and sestra (Interlingua: viro, immediatemente, vetere, soror) into Interlingua could only be done by doing away with the control languages, the very core of Interlingua's methodology for determining its vocabulary. Interlingua also allowed optional irregular verbal conjugations (such as so, son and sia[77] as the first-person singular, third-person plural and subjunctive form of esser, the verb 'to be') that Occidental had never even considered and viewed as incompatible with an easy international auxiliary language.\nAll of this happened in a time when Occidental, based in Europe, was still recovering from the war. The movement had economic difficulties, not like the well-funded[81] IALA which was based in New York.\nInternational politics was another difficulty for Occidentalists after the war. The beginning of the Cold War created a particularly uncomfortable situation for the Occidental-Union,[82][83][84] which had the same name as an anti-Russian political league, and which the Occidentalists in Switzerland believed to be the reason for the interception of all of de Wahl's letters sent from Tallinn.[85] De Wahl remained in the dark about developments in the language and the proposal up to his death in 1948.[86] In early 1948 the Czechoslovak Occidentalists had begun asking for the approval for a new name that would allow them to continue their linguistic activities without problems, proposing the name Interal (International auxiliari lingue), to which the union responded that the term Interlingue would be more appropriate and that they were free to introduce the language as \"Interlingue (Occidental)\", or even remove the mention of Occidental in parentheses if they felt it necessary.[87] Ric Berger began supporting a change of name from Occidental to Interlingue in 1948[88] which he also hoped would help in uniting both languages.[89] The official vote on the name change to Interlingue took place at the plenum of the Occidental Union in 1949 and was passed with 91% support, making the official name Interlingue, with Interlingue (Occidental) also permitted, valid as of 1 September 1949.[90]\nOnce Interlingua was announced in 1951, Interlingue-Occidental suffered as now it had a competitor in the field of naturalistic planned auxiliary languages. V\u0115ra Barandovsk\u00e1-Frank's perception of the situation at the time was as follows (translated from Esperanto):[91]\nAndr\u00e9 Martinet, the second-last director of the IALA, made similar observations to those of Matejka. He confessed that his preferred variant of Interlingua was the one closer to Interlingue than the one officialized by Gode. In these circumstances the efforts by Ric Berger to move all users of Interlingue en masse to Interlingua de IALA was a shock. His heresy caused doubt and interruptions in Interlingue circles, especially after he became involved in the publication of \"Revista de Interlingua\". The former idea of a natural fusion of both languages was shown to be unrealistic, with the new language becoming a rival.[92]\nDon Harlow's summary of the year 1951 for Occidental[81] is also similar to that of Barandovsk\u00e1-Frank's:\nHalt and revival.\nWhile the moving of so many users to Interlingua had very much weakened the Interlingue movement, the following drop in activity was gradual and happened over decades. \"Cosmoglotta B\" stopped being published after 1950, and the frequency of \"Cosmoglotta A\" began to slowly drop: once every second month from 1952, and then once per quarter from 1963. Other bulletins in Interlingue continued to appear during this time such as \"Cive del Munde\" (Switzerland), \"Voce de Praha\" (Czechoslovakia), \"Sved Interlinguist\" (Sweden), \"International Memorandum\" (United Kingdom), \"Interlinguistic Novas\" (France), \"Jurnale Scolari International\" (France), \"Buletine Pedagogic International\" (Francia), \"Super li Frontieras\" (France), \"Interlingue-Postillon\" (1958, Germany), \"Novas de Oriente\" (1958, Japan), \"Amicitie european\" (1959, Switzerland), \"Teorie e practica\" (Switzerland-Czechoslovakia, 1967), and \"Novas in Interlingue\" (Czechoslovakia, 1971). Barandovsk\u00e1-Frank believed that the decrease of interest in Occidental-Interlingue happened at the same time as generation that was first drawn to it from other planned languages was getting older (translated from Esperanto):Most of those interested in Interlingue belonged to the generation that became familiar in turn with Volap\u00fck, Esperanto and Ido, later on finding the most aesthetic (basically naturalistic) solution in Occidental-Interlingue. After that, many moved to IALA's Interlingua, which however did not prove to be much more successful despite the impression its scientific origin made, and those who remained loyal to Occidental-Interlingue did not succeed in giving their excitement to a new generation.Activity in Interlingue eventually reached a low during the 1980s and early 1990s, when \"Cosmoglotta\" publication stopped for a some years. This can be seen in the frequency of \"Cosmoglotta\": while issue 269 was published in 1972 after publishing once per season between 1963, issue 289 was not reached until summer 2000 for an average of less than one issue per year. According to Harlow, \"in 1985 Occidental's last periodical, \"Cosmoglotta\", ceased publication, and its editor, Mr. Adrian Pilgrim, is quoted as having described Occidental as a 'dead language.'\" A decade later, a documentary film in 1994 by Steve Hawley and Steyger on planned languages introduced Interlingue speaker Donald Gasper as \"one of the last remaining speakers of the language Occidental\".\nAs was the case for other planned languages, it was the arrival of the internet that allowed the language to revive. In the year 1999 the first Yahoo! Group in Occidental was founded, \"Cosmoglotta\" had begun publishing intermittently again, and the language became a subject of discussion in literature on auxiliary languages. One example is \"The Esperanto Book\" published in 1995 by Harlow, who wrote that Occidental had an intentional emphasis on European forms and that some of its leading followers espoused a Eurocentric philosophy, which may have set back its spread. Still, the opposite view was also common in the community and Occidental gained supporters in many nations including Asian nations. An Interlingue Wikipedia was approved in 2004. In recent years official meetings between Interlingue speakers have begun taking place again: a meeting in Ulm on 10 January 2013, another in Munich in 2014 with three participants, and a third in Ulm on 16 August 2015 with five.\nThe most recent edition of the magazine \"Cosmoglotta\" is volume 325, for the period January to December 2019."}

It lives in many parts of Australia, not far from the coast.

The rest of its body has white feathers except for the bars on the wings and two stripes on the back. Unlike many other shorebirds, this bird's bill curves upward instead of curving downward or being straight. Its legs are long and blue-gray. When the red-necked avocet flies, it sticks its legs out behind it instead of tucking them under its body.\nRed-necked avocets spend time in the same places as the pied stilt and banded stilt. For example, they may all look for food in the same place at the same time.\nHabitat and food.\nThis bird wades or swims in shallow water. It catches food by moving its bill side to side in the water. It eats animals without spines or bones. It also eats seeds.\nBreeding.\nThis bird lays eggs when there is enough rainfall. Australia does not have the same seasons as other parts of the world, so sometimes the birds go years in between groups of eggs.\nLarge numbers of birds make nests near each other in a colony. The nests are small holes dug into the ground."}

Meira Paibi work against many different social evils. They especially work against the cruelty of the Indian Army and the military in Manipur, India. They are called the \"Guardians of the society\". The name comes from the burning torches that the women carry. It has become the symbol for peaceful protest for justice at all levels of life.\nThe meira paibi is the largest basic level, weaponless movement fighting with the state's inhumanity and human rights violations in Manipur. The women have always faced the strength of the armed forces with nothing other than their unity and will power for many decades. \nThese women's organisations stop the arrest of men by the paramilitaries, without much causes or good proofs. Generally, the meira paibi groups are formed in the peopled areas of Imphal and other places in the valley of Manipur. They are usually the patrollers of the streets, mainly at night time. They often constitute a large, unified and disciplined group at public gatherings, especially for protests.\nToday, every Meitei locality has the organisations of the meira paibi. They did this to save Manipur from being a land of victims and unhappiness. In fact, with the dedicated contributions of the meira paibis, the drug abuse patterns have been effectively reduced.\nHistory.\nThe Meitei women started the meira paibi movement in the 1970s in Manipur, India. They stood against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). Besides, they were also fighting against crimes against women and drugs abuse. \nIn 1980, the entire Manipur state was brought under the AFSPA to conflicting rebellions. Many innocent young men were often arrested, tortured and killed. At this, the women demanded the removal of the act. Along with this, the group of women patrolled the streets to stop improper search operations by the security forces. Simultaneously, the women became the \"Wall protecting society against violence and killings\".\nIn July, 2004, the meira paibi protests hit the global headlines when the 12 Meitei Manipuri women stood without clothes in front of the Kangla Fort. It was where the Assam Rifles (a unit of Indian Army) were stationed. There, they protested naked, carrying a banner that reads \"Indian Army Rape Us.\" They were protesting against the rape, torture and custodial killing of , a young woman, by the Assam Rifles troops.\nPublic response.\nThe meira paibis and the Meitei women should be the role model to every women to know their responsibilities and contributions in social welfare. After knowing this, the UNICEF says: \n\"The Manipuri story indicates that active participation by women in public affairs can and does contribute to better conditions for children and society at large.\"\nIn 2013, The Times of India awarded the \"TOI Social Impact Awards: Lifetime Contribution\" to the meira paibis of Manipur."}

The feathers on the front and underside of its body are light gray. Its bill and legs are yellow-green. Its eyes are red.\nHabitat and food.\nBaillon's crakes live in wetlands, for example swamps. They sometimes run across the top of the water on floating plants.\nBaillon's crakes eat animals without bones, for example insects, crustaceans, and snails. They catch them in the mud at the edges of wetlands and from floating plants.\nBreeding.\nBaillon's crake makes a simple nest out of dry plants. It hides the nest in little raised bits of ground near the edge of the swamp. Both the male and female crake sit on the eggs and watch the chicks."}

It was directed by Johnson Rajkumar. It is about the struggles of the Meira Paibis to protect the people from crimes in Manipur state. It also shows the role of women in the conflicting and male-dominated society of Manipur. It looks at how the gender gap and gender identities are settled during times of conflict and violence in the society.\nThe movie shows women reacting to the rising cases of disappearance of men. This took place after the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) was applied to Manipur state. The important point of the movie is that women stand up for the safety, security and better survival of the men.\nPlot.\nIn 1980s, when Manipur was exposed to revolutionaries and armed violence, a group of women came out to the streets to uphold peace in the state. These groups were called the Meira Paibis. They were the freely independent women's organisations. They participated in the willing patrols during the night. They held the flaming torches and tried to bring balance in the society.&gt;\nBackground.\nIn India, women are mostly seen to be confined in their homes. In reality, they are the important members of every social movement. But they are always seen as not related. Women of Manipur contributed a lot towards the welfare of the social conditions. This really inspired Johnson Rajkumar, the maker of the \"Fireflies\". \nHe tried to show the influence of gender roles in conflicts and violence. If men were holding such responsibilities, they would have been falsely grouped into rebels. According to Johnson, the movie shows that women's collective has more to do beyond pro-feminists. \nRajkumar went to Bangalore for higher education. There, he realised that the issues from Manipur and the North East India were not truly represented or interpreted in the national media news. Hence, he created the \"Fireflies\" to fight the set false stories. He wanted to show the best formal true facts.\nProduction.\nThe movie is financially supported by the \"Samaj Pragati Sahayog\", a social media platform based in Madhya Pradesh, India. Additionally, it is supported by the Film Division of India. \nRajkumar is the director of the movie and a Manipuri media activist. He lives in Bangalore, Karnataka. He has been making documentary movies on social and political issues. He focuses on social movements and protests.\nRecognition.\nThe movie won many awards in international film festivals. These were held in different countries of the world."}

{"id": "871363", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871363", "title": "Kingdom of Aragon", "text": "The Kingdom of Aragon (, , , ) was one of the Hispanic kingdoms of the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. It arose in the central Pyrenean region in 1035 after the union of the Carolingian counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. Subsequently it expanded southward, as it took over Muslim territories, until it came to occupy the area corresponding to the current autonomous community of Aragon.\nNot to be confused with the Crown of Aragon, a group of territories over which the King of Aragon was sovereign. At first it consisted of the Kingdom of Aragon itself plus the possessions of the Count of Barcelona, and later the Kingdom of Mallorca, the Kingdom of Valencia, and several territories in the Mediterranean were added by conquest. Although it was never considered a kingdom, Catalonia was one of the territories that made up the Crown, and since it had a large population and military weight, it was considered one of the \"kingdoms\" of the Crown of Aragon.\nFrom the end of the 15th century, after the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs, the dynastic union of the Crowns of Aragon and Castile took place. However, unlike the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon continued to function as a composite and pacitist monarchy, in which the territories shared the same monarch but maintained different laws, institutions and ways of relating to the king. Thus, the Kingdom of Aragon, like the other territories of the Crown of Aragon, maintained its own laws and institutions until 1707, in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession, King Philip V, first king of the House of Bourbon, abolished its laws, abolished the Council of Aragon and the rest of its own institutions, such as the Justice, the Provincial Council or the Courts of Aragon, imposing the laws and institutions of the Crown of Castile, through the Decrees of Nueva Planta.\nAragon would continue to be considered a territorial division of Spain until 1833, when Javier de Burgos established the territorial division by provinces, ending the division by kingdoms. The other territories of the former crown of Aragon also saw their institutions and laws abolished after the various Nueva Planta Decrees: the courts of the principality of Catalonia, the kingdom of Valencia and the kingdom of Mallorca, like those of Aragon, were from then on convened jointly with the Cortes of Castile.\nStory.\nOrigin: The county of Aragon.\nThe marriage of Andregoto, daughter of Count Galindo II of Aragon, to King Garcia Sanchez I of Navarre, led to the union of both political entities. The County of Aragon continued to retain a certain personality that had been reinforced by the revival of monastic life and the organization of a diocese coinciding with the county boundaries.\nIn 1035 Ramiro, natural son of Sancho III of Navarre and baiulus of the county of Aragon, incorporated the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, which had been under the rule of his brother Gonzalo, into the county. After Sancho's death, the county split from the kingdom of Navarre and was constituted as a separate kingdom, although under the tutelage of the Navarrese kingdom governed by his brother Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III. Limited to the Pyrenean valleys and neighboring the more powerful kingdom of Navarre and the important Taifa of Saragossa, the increase in population and the thirst for land for its inhabitants impelled it to expand, despite its initial military weakness.\nThe legitimacy of the new dynasty was achieved by the kings Sancho Ram\u00edrez and Pedro I by placing the kingdom under the protection of the Holy See. Thus the Kingdom of Aragon became part of the western states. The donation of the kingdom to the pope was made by Sancho Ramirez in 1068, in an attempt to strengthen his position against his hostile neighbors, sometimes allied against him.\n11th-12th centuries: Expansion of the kingdom.\nRamiro I's projection for the reconquest of the plain land was far surpassed by his immediate successors.\nThe king of Navarre Sancho Garc\u00e9s IV was assassinated by his own brother in 1076. The Navarrese, not wanting to be governed by the fratricide, elected Sancho Ramirez of Aragon -cousin of the deceased- as their king, who incorporated the crown of Pamplona to that of Aragon. The kingdom of Navarre was divided between Le\u00f3n-Castile and Aragon; the latter received the main territories, including the capital of Navarre, and tripled its extension, although in exchange for admitting the theoretical supremacy of Castile-Le\u00f3n. To celebrate the expansion, Sancho founded the city of Jaca, where he took up residence and to which he transferred the Mozarabic bishopric (of Hispano-Visigothic liturgical tradition under Muslim rule) of Huesca in 1077. As he controlled the highlands bordering the Ebro to the north, he was able to undertake various raids, mainly against the Zaragozan taifa, and try to expand into the plain, mainly along the valleys of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. To compensate for the lack of soldiers needed for territorial expansion, he tried to bring them from the south of France. Expansion, however, was slow and was carried out especially through the conquest of strategic points, such as Graus in 1083 and Ayerbe, around the same time. The advances towards the south were accelerated at the end of the century, both by the lack of support of Alfonso to the Zaragozans and by the march of the Cid to the Levant, who until then had fought with them. In 1089, the Aragonese seized Monz\u00f3n, which hindered communications between L\u00e9rida and Huesca, and in 1091 they built the castle of El Castellar, between Zaragoza and Tudela. Sancho undertook the siege of the important city of Huesca -much larger than Jaca and Pamplona and probably than any peninsular city in Christian hands, except Barcelona and Toledo- in 1094, but died of an arrow shot. He was immediately succeeded by his son Pedro, already associated with power and who soon resumed the siege.\nKing Pedro I of Aragon (1070-1104) conquered Huesca on November 27, 1096, after defeating King Al-Musta'in II of Taifa of Zaragoza in the battle of Alcoraz, which was fought on November 18 of that year. In 1101 he took Barbastro and Sari\u00f1ena, and took Tamarite de Litera in 1104. In this reign the Fuero de Infanzones was regulated.\nDuring the reign of Alfonso I the Battler (1104-1134), in the course of a few years, with the valuable collaboration of the feudal nobility of southern France, the urban centers and regions of Tudela, Tarazona, Calatayud, Daroca and Zaragoza were conquered, and after the death of his brother Pedro I of Aragon, he decided to act on the Cinco Villas and in 1105 he conquered Ejea de los Caballeros.\nThe king of Saragossa, Al-Musta'in II decided to carry out a plundering expedition against the neighboring Christians in the year 1110 and ended up fighting with the border knights in the battle of Valtierra where he was defeated and killed. The capture of Saragossa in 1118 meant the fall of the entire Moorish kingdom, thus radically changing the social structures and spiritual horizons of the small kingdom of highlanders that until then had been Aragon.\nIn 1120 the Aragonese monarch conquered Calatayud, Daroca, granted a charter to Soria and that same year the Aragonese army won a very important victory over the Muslims in the battle of Cutanda. 1125 saw the organization of the great military expedition of Alfonso I of Aragon through Andalusia, demonstrating the weakness of Almoravid power in Levante and Andalusia.\nKing Battallador, who had failed in his marriage to the Leonese queen Urraca, had no descendants. In his singular will, he made the military orders heirs to his kingdoms, but nobody thought of fulfilling this will and the Aragonese nobles, gathered in Jaca, recognized his brother Ramiro as king. For their part, the Navarrese elected Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, which determined the separation of the Kingdom of Navarre. At that time Ramiro was bishop of Roda-Barbastro, but he had to occupy the throne.\nRamiro II of Aragon (1086-1157) reigned for only three years, from 1134 to 1137, and was married to In\u00e9s de Poitou, daughter of Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who was crowned in Saragossa in 1134.\nCrown of Aragon.\nIn 1137 Ramiro II the Monk arranged the betrothal of Petronila of Aragon to Ram\u00f3n Berenguer IV of Barcelona. Their son, Alfonso II, was the first king to inherit the titles of King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona.\nAt its greatest territorial extension, the Kingdom of Aragon was made up of the territories that today form the Autonomous Community of Aragon, plus a large part of the current province of L\u00e9rida, most of the Ebro valley up to the sea, with Tortosa as the main coastal city, and the north of the current province of Castell\u00f3n. This expansion was articulated through the creation of the Marquisates of L\u00e9rida and Tortosa, although they were later ceded by James I of Aragon to the Principality of Catalonia.\nFerdinand II (1479-1516) married Isabella I of Castile. Their grandson, Charles I, inherited both crowns, but each maintained its own laws and customs.\nIn 1700, with the death of Charles II, Philip of Anjou was proclaimed king of Castile and Aragon, which provoked the War of the Spanish Succession. The Crown of Aragon sided with Archduke Charles, the other pretender. When the war ended, Philip V promulgated the decrees of Nueva Planta, which abolished the foral institutions of the Crown of Aragon, which was integrated into a modern and centralized state in most of its territory, except in the Basque Provinces and Navarre, which continued to maintain their fueros. In 1711 the Captaincy General of Aragon was created.\nFueros.\nFueros is a term that can have several meanings. They were a pact between the king and the inhabitants of a place, which could be a city or an entire kingdom. The fueros of Aragon were the set of laws in force in the Kingdom of Aragon, compiled in 1247.\nThey replaced the local charters that existed previously, such as the charter of Jaca, granted by King Sancho el Mayor, who granted good charters to encourage the settlement in the city of Christians from the other side of the Pyrenees. These charters, or charters derived from them, were later granted to other cities and towns in Aragon and were also the basis for charters granted to towns in other kingdoms.\nThe Justice of Aragon began as a judge of the Court, and in 1265 was established as a judge of lawsuits between the nobles and the king and as president of the Cortes of the kingdom. At first he was appointed by the king from among the nobles, but ended up being a dignity sometimes for life and hereditary, his prerogatives being cut in 1592 as a result of the Alterations of Aragon.\nIn 1283, after King Peter III was excommunicated by Pope Martin IV for having occupied Sicily, a feudatory kingdom of the Holy See, the Aragonese oligarchy confederated to limit royal power and extract new privileges. The king was forced to grant the General Privilege in what would be known as the revolt of the Union in 1283. His son James II is forced to grant the Privilege of the Union. During the reign of James I, various assemblies, more or less crowded, had met to settle lawsuits. The Privilege of the Union requires the annual convocation of a court of nobles and citizens, which will end up including four arms: the rich men, the infanzones and knights, the ecclesiastical authorities and the universities. At that time, the cities, towns and communities of the kingdom were called universities. The Courts of Aragon were not convened with the required regularity, but eventually took control of the kingdom's taxation, granting funds to the king in exchange for the maintenance and extension of the privileges of the estates represented in them. \nThe General Delegation of the Kingdom was created in 1363 as the body delegated by the Cortes to collect and administer taxes and tariffs, and to deliver the agreed funds to the king. The four branches of the Cortes are represented in it, with two deputies for each branch. Over time its attributions will grow as it will be in charge of the administration of the funds necessary to preserve the peace and welfare of the kingdom. \nFerdinand the Catholic instituted the figure of the Viceroy, who would exercise the royal powers when the king was absent from the kingdom, something that would frequently happen with the monarchs of the House of Austria. The Viceroy was responsible for the Governor, who was in charge of maintaining order and social peace, and the Royal Audience, a court that would impart justice in serious or very important cases, or those that affected individuals with privileges. He also established the authority of the Inquisition in the kingdom, a body that later kings abused to circumvent the provisions of the Aragonese fueros, which did not prevail over the Inquisition, as occurred in the Alterations of Aragon.\nTerritorial organization.\nThe oldest administrative system of the kingdom was based on the distribution of towns and lands to the nobles who participated in the conquest. The nobles could receive these honors in property or in tenancy, when the king reserved the property but ceded its administration to the noble. The nobles could receive castles in tenancy, being in charge of keeping them garrisoned in exchange for populating and obtaining rents from the lands they controlled.\nThe king also granted the administration of lands and towns to the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Bishoprics, archpriestships, abbeys and military orders administered and collected rents from the honors granted to them.\nOver time, the king will begin to create a network of officials to control the lands and towns directly dependent on him, called realengo. The merino was an executive, judicial and military agent of the monarch that is already documented in the Fuero de Jaca. The bailes began with similar competencies, but ended up specializing in the management of the royal patrimony. The king granted to cities and villas of royalty privileges that specified the privileges of their neighbors. The regions of Daroca, Teruel, Calatayud, Albarrac\u00edn and others were organized into communities that sent their own representatives to the Cortes. In the 15th century, the territory of the kingdom was divided into eleven overcollides for tax purposes, which were converted into paths, with some modifications, in the 17th century.\nDemography.\nBefore the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the population in what would later become Aragon was a mixture of Iberian and Celtiberian substratum with Roman colonizers and Visigoth invaders, with Vascones occupying the Pyrenean valleys. There was also a Jewish minority, the result of the 1st century diaspora. This minority, tolerated by the Romans, was being persecuted by the Visigoths in the period prior to the Muslim invasion.\nThe Muslim invaders were not very numerous, being mainly Berbers, but also, in later waves, Arabs and Syrians. Those established in the Ebro valley were mostly Arabs, divided between Qaysids and Kalbis, Arabs from the north and south. The majority of the Muslim population in the area at the time of the reconquest were Muladis, Christians converted to Islam. Those Christians who did not convert, called Mozarabs, were tolerated by the Muslim rulers in exchange for the payment of special taxes.\nThe first counts of the Marca Hispanica were Franks, but in time they were replaced by local elites, Vasconas and Hispano-Visigoths. The kings of Pamplona and later of Aragon promoted the immigration of Franks and Occitanians to their kingdoms, as well as Mozarabs. With the invasion of the Almohad fundamentalists, Jewish communities from al-Andalus also migrated to the Christian kingdoms. After the conquest of the Ebro valley, a considerable number of Muslims became subjects of the king of Aragon. These Muslims, called Mudejars, formed an important part of the artisan and agricultural class of the kingdom, as reflected in the widespread Aragonese Mudejar architecture.\nThe 13th century was the golden age of the Jews of Aragon. The Jewish minority was eminently urban, engaging in all kinds of occupations, but excelling in medicine, administration, tax collection and lending. The Jews were considered property of the crown, and the king provided them with protection in exchange for special contributions. The same century saw the arrival of Cathar refugees from Occitania, fleeing religious persecution. The situation of the Jews worsened at the end of the century due to pressure from the Catholic hierarchy, and they were forbidden to hold public office. Many Aragonese Jews converted to Christianity, with greater or lesser conviction, to avoid high taxes and persecution. These converts were integrated into the Christian population, even mixing with noble families. This could explain the significant frequency of Jewish haplotypes in the contemporary Aragonese population.\nThe internal conflicts, the war with Castile and above all the Black Death and other epidemics in the 14th century produced an important decrease in the population of the kingdom. In 1492 the Catholic Monarchs decreed the conversion or expulsion of the Jews. In 1495 a census was taken, the fogaje of 1495, which revealed a total of 51 540 fires in the kingdom, or about 200 000 inhabitants. Muslims then made up 11% of the total population. The most populated city, Zaragoza, had less than 20,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1525 Charles I also decreed the conversion or expulsion of the Mudejars, being baptized most of the Muslims of Aragon in 1526. During the 16th century the total population grew by 50%, especially on the banks of the Ebro and its tributaries on the right bank. Part of the growth was due to immigration from north of the Pyrenees. In the 17th century, population growth slowed down. In 1610 some 65,000 Moriscos were expelled, about 20% of the population. Other significant factors in the slower population growth were the loss of agricultural production due to the expulsion of the Moors and periods of drought, a plague that devastated the kingdom from 1647 to 1654, the increase in taxation and the uprising in Catalonia.\nAlready in the 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession led to a decrease of about 10% in population, including the emigration of many of the residents of French origin after Archduke Charles decreed their expulsion."}

It is a subspecies of Baillon's crake. It lives in New Zealand.\nAppearance.\nThe marsh crake is about half the size of a blackbird. It is about 15-18 cm long and it weighs 30 to 40 grams. It has a short tail and long legs. The feathers on its back are deep brown with black and white marks. The feathers on its belly are gray and white. Its eyes are bright red. Its beak and legs are green. The young birds have brown bellies instead of gray and white.\nHabitat and food.\nMarsh crakes live in wetlands, for example marshes. They also live among the reed plants in places where rivers meet the ocean. They can live on wet pastures and willow tree forests too. There are more marsh crakes on New Zealand's South Island than on North Island.\nScientists do not know much about what the marsh crake does. They think it might migrate like other Baillon's crakes do, but they are not sure.\nThe marsh crake eats animals without bones but it also eats the seeds of water plants.\nBreeding.\nMarsh crakes form one-on-one pairs to lay eggs. The males fly courtship flights to impress the females. They build nests out of dry plants and hide them in sedge. The female lays 5-7 eggs at a time. Both the male and female crake sit on the eggs. The eggs take 16-20 days to hatch. The chicks have black and brown feathers.\nThreats.\nThe marsh crake is declining, which means there are fewer of them than there were, and the numbers are still going down. This is because human beings drain their marshes to turn them into dry land.\nAlso, human beings brought cats, dogs, weasel-like animals, rats to New Zealand. All of these animals can kill the birds, their eggs, and their chicks.\nLess often, a marsh crake will be hit by a car or fly into a power line. If human beings make too much noise near a nest, the parent birds will run away and the eggs will die."}

What is now France made up the most of the area known to the Romans as Gaul. Greek writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest group, were Celts that spoke what is known as the Gaulish language.\nOver the course of the first millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic conquered southern Gaul and added it as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC. Roman Legions under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58\u201351 BC. After that, a Gallo-Roman culture came out and Gaul was more and more integrated into the Roman Empire.\nIn the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian sudden attacks and migration, most importantly by the Germanic Franks. The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, preparing the conditions for Frankish control in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne. The medieval Kingdom of France came out from the western part of Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire, known as West Francia, and achieved increasing importance under the rule of the House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987.\nA succession crisis following the death of the last direct Capetian king in 1328 led to the series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years' War between the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet. The war formally began in 1337 following Philip VI's attempt to grab and take control of the Duchy of Aquitaine from its holder, Edward III of England, the Plantagenet claimant to the French throne. Despite early Plantagenet victories, including the capture and ransom of John II of France, fortunes turned in favor of the Valois later in the war. Among the important figures of the war was Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who led French forces against the English. The war ended with a Valois victory in 1453.\nVictory in the Hundred Years' War had the effect of strengthening French nationalism and hugely increasing the power and reach of the French monarchy. During the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" period over the next centuries, France changed into a centralized absolute monarchy through Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. At the height of the French Wars of Religion, France became involved in another succession crisis, as the last Valois king, Henry III, fought against rival groups the House of Bourbon and the House of Guise. Henry, the Bourbon King of Navarre, won the conflict and established the Bourbon dynasty. A growing worldwide colonial empire was established in the 16th century. French political power reached a high point under the rule of Louis XIV, \"The Sun King\".\nIn the late 18th century the monarchy and connected institutions were brought down in the French Revolution. The country was ruled for a period as a Republic, until Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire was declared. Following his defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, France went through several further government changes, being ruled as a monarchy, then briefly as a Second Republic, and then as a Second Empire, until a more lasting French Third Republic was established in 1870.\nFrance was one of the Triple Entente powers in World War I against Germany and the Central Powers. France was one of the Allied Powers in World War II, but was conquered by Nazi Germany in 1940. The Third Republic was taken apart, and most of the country was controlled directly by Germany while the south was controlled until 1942 by the collaborationist Vichy government. Living conditions were harsh as Germany drained away food and manpower, and many Jews were killed. The Free France movement that took over the colonial empire, and coordinated the wartime Resistance. Following liberation in 1944, the Fourth Republic was established. France slowly recovered, and enjoyed a baby boom that reversed its very low fertility rate. Long wars in Indochina and Algeria drained French resources and ended in political defeat. At the beginning of the 1958 Algerian Crisis, Charles de Gaulle set up the French Fifth Republic. Into the 1960s decolonization saw most of the French colonial empire become independent, while smaller parts were included into the French state as overseas departments and collectivities. Since World War II France has been a permanent member in the UN Security Council and NATO. It played a central role in the unification process after 1945 that led to the European Union. Despite slow economic growth in recent years, it remains a strong economic, cultural, military and political factor in the 21st century."}

It is the only market in the world run entirely by women. Men are not allowed to sell anything. The Manipur Government has announced that the male shopkeepers will be punished if their shops are found inside the market. \nThe market has around 5000-6000 shopkeepers. Women sell many kinds of things, like vegetables, clothes and many others. These are mostly local made of the state. \nThe market was established in the sixteenth century AD. It has three large buildings. These are named after the three goddesses of Meitei religion. The goddesses are Leimarel Sidabi, Emoinu and Phouoibi.\nIma Keithel is a perfect example of the long-lasting tradition of business management done by women in Manipur. Traditionally, Meitei women always enjoyed high status in the economy of the society. Women lead the trade and commerce in food and vegetables, household things and clothes in Manipuri society. In history, it is the symbol of the empowerment and the leadership prospects of women in Manipur.\nHistory.\nThe market was established in the 16th century AD. During that time, the Lallup system (forced labor system) began in 1533 AD. The men had to either join the army or serve the kingdom elsewhere far from their homes. At those times, women supported their their families. They did everything that men had used to do. Women did everything from farming to making clothes. Finally, they sold many things at the market. The market was one of the most important permanent markets in the kingdom until the 20th century.\nAdministration.\nThe market is run by a group of shopkeepers. It sets many traditional rules. According to it, women who marry only once in a lifetime are allowed to set up shops in the market. The shopkeepers include divorced women and widows. Many of them were the victims of the militancy in Manipur. Most of the women in the market are between 45 and 70 years old.

Prostitution is when someone does a sex act in exchange for money or other payment. Punishments range from five to fifteen years in prison. The country is deeply religious. It is one of the most conservative countries in the world. Sex outside marriage is against the law and can be punished with death.\nBecause most people in Afghanistan are poor, or they have been displaced, more and more have become prostitutes. APMG Health estimated there were12,500 prostitutes in the country in 2015. In 2020 UNAIDS estimated there were 11,000 prostitutes in Kabul, Herat, Mazar and Jalalabad based on a 2019 survey. Before the foreign troops left the country, many of the brothels and prostitutes were located close to US bases.\nA number of women from China, Iran, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan have been trafficked into Afghanistan, to become prostitutes. Afghan women are also trafficked to other countries for sexual exploitation. Child prostitution in the form of Bacha Bazi is also a problem in the country.\nThe Taliban, who have again come to power in 2021, have values that are deeply rooted in Islamic ethics. They have punished unmarried people with up to 80 lashes. Married prostitutes are considered adulterers, under Afghan law.\nEven before the Talian took control of the country, Islamic fundamentalists have killed people for having sex outside marriage, without waiting for a state trial. Prostitution is seen as very bad. To keep the family in good standing, prostitutes sometimes get killed by members of their own family.\nSituation.\nIn the 1990s, prostitution existed in secret in Kabul. The government who followed a very strict interpretation of the Islamic Sharia law had made it illegal. Melissa Ditmore reported in \"Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work\" that during their rule the traffic in women for prostitution had increased. Prostitutes mostly worked from their homes. These were called Qalas. In Kabul there were 25 to 30 hidden brothels.\nBecause women were not allowed to work during the Taliban regime of the 1990s, this forced many children to enter the sex trade to make a living. According to the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, women from Iran, Tajikistan, China, and other places have been forced into prostitution in Afghanistan.\nMany people have lived in Afghanistan as refugees. Most of these came from neighboring countries. There have been reports that Afghan women as well as boys and girls among these refugees were forced into prostitution. Because of poverty, several families have also been reported to be selling their children.\nA 2007 University of Manitoba report suggests that there may be about 900 female prostitutes in Kabul. Kabul is a city with a population of over 4 million today. Latest estimates show that there may be between 11,000 and 12,500 sex workers in the country. Between 2007 and 2008, two to three people were arrested because of prostitution per week, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry's department of sexual crimes.\nIn Afghan culture and traditions, prostitution is seen as very shameful. Sometimes, religious extremists, kill prostitutes. In some cases, prostitutes get killed by members of their own family:\nTemporary marriages.\n\"Nikah mut'ah\" is a fixed-term marriage in Shia Islam; most other Muslims reject the idea. There have also been some reports about \"Mut'ah\" (\"Fegha\" in Persian language) beginning to be practiced in Mazar-i-Sharif. \nBacha bazi.\nLike in many other Islamic countries, it is a major taboo in Afghan culture for women to openly dance in front of men. Males and females are separated during weddings and other parties. As a form of adult entertainment, young males dress as females and dance in front of men to make money. \"Bacha bereesh\" (meaning \"boys without beards\" in Persian language) occasionally dance to entertain men at certain parties, especially in the north parts of Afghanistan. Powerful patrons sometimes sexually exploit the dancers. It is estimated that about 10,000 men across Afghanistan engage in sexual activities with other men.\nThe \"Curse of 39\".\nIn some parts of Afghanistan, people believe that the number 39 is cursed or a badge of shame: They say it is linked with prostitution.\nIt is unclear, why the number is undesirable. It has often been associated with a pimp, who was living in Herat: This pimp had the nickname \"39\", after the number plate of his expensive car, and the number of his apartment. The number is said to translate into \"morda-gow\", literally meaning \"dead cow\" but a well-known slang term for a pimp. Others have blamed corrupt police officials for spreading the rumour in order to charge between $200\u2013500 to change a \"39\" plate.\nVehicle registration plates with the number are seen as so undesirable that vehicles and apartments bearing the numerals are said to be virtually unsellable in the capital, Kabul. The drivers of such vehicles have reported abuse and derision from pedestrians and other drivers. Some have had their registration plates altered to hide the numbers. One such driver, Zalmay Ahmadi, told \"The Guardian\": \"When I drive around all the other cars flash their lights, beep their horns and people point at me. All my classmates now call me Colonel 39.\" Number plates containing '39' were withdrawn in early 2021.\nHuman trafficking.\n\u00a0In 2019, the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons downgraded Afghanistan to a 'Tier 2 watchlist' country'. In 2020, it further downgraded the country to 'Tier 3'. The Government of Afghanistan does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. The country remained in 'Tier 3' in 2021.\nWomen and girls from China, Iran, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Tajikistan have been subject to sex trafficking in Afghanistan. Afghan women, and children pay other people to help them find a job abroad. In most cases, they want to work in Iran, Pakistan, and in Europe. Some of these people force them into sex trafficking. In 2021 it was estimated that over 7000 young Afghan girls had been sold into prostitution in India."}

Reduced affect is often the symptom of autism, depression, schizoid personality disorder, schizophrenia or even post-traumatic stress disorder. It is also often the side effect of certain drugs (these tend to include antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs).\nReduced affect is different from apathy and anhedonia (these others mean not having enough or \"any\" emotion). Reduced affect means not enough or any \"expressions\" of emotion (affect displays), without mattering whether or not emotions are actually reduced.\nTypes of flat or blunted affects.\nConstricted or restricted affects mean when one's abilities to express themselves with certain levels of emotional intensity are limited or not done fully.\nBlunted affect is totally different from flat affects. \"Blunted\" (in \"blunted affects\") means people still have affects. These people's responses in emotions, however, are usually not intense or strong like others would normally predict."}
{"id": "871936", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871936", "title": "Martin Hemings", "text": "Martin Hemings (1755-????) was a man from Virginia. He was the oldest male child of Elizabeth \"Betty\" Hemings. History does not say who his father was, but it was not John Wayles. Martin Hemings was the half-brother of Sally Hemings and James Hemings. For part of his life, he was enslaved to Thomas Jefferson.\nFamily history and early life.\nAccording to Madison Hemings, Sally Hemings' grandmother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include \"Dinah,\" \"Judy,\" \"Abbie,\" \"Sarah,\" \"Parthenia,\" and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named \"Thenia\" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that \"Sally\" is a nickname for \"Sarah,\" and there were many girls named \"Sarah\" and \"Sally\" in the Hemings family too.\nMartin Hemings' mother was called Elizabeth \"Betty\" Hemings. Martin Hemings' nephew Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.\nCaptain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says \"about 1735.\" \nElizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.\nElizabeth Hemings had many children. Martin Hemings was born on a plantation called The Forest that belonged to John Wayles. History does not say who his father was. John Wayles was the father of most of Elizabeth Hemings' other children.\nWhen Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Martin Hemings was 17 or 18 years old. He later became the butler of Monticello and lived there for many years. When Thomas Jefferson became governor of Virginia and lived in houses in Richmond, Virginia and Williamsburg, Virginia, Martin Hemings went with him.\nPersonality.\nWe do not know what Martin Hemings was like when he was around other black people. This is because no writings about this survive. But many of Thomas Jefferson's letters have been saved and copied. Thomas Jefferson wrote about the enslaved people a lot. Thomas Jefferson wrote about Martin having a fiery temper.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the British army captured Monticello. Martin Hemings hid the valuable silver tableware\u2014forks, knives and other items for eating. He hid them under the floorboards. Another enslaved man, called Caesar, hid with them and could not get out for days. Martin did not tell the British soldiers where the silver was, not even when they hit him.\nWhite people wrote about how this showed Martin was loyal to his master and his country. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed writes that perhaps Martin just did not like being told what to do.\nLater life.\nJefferson was away from Monticello a lot. After his wife died, he wanted to be somewhere else. He even went to Paris for years when he was the United States Ambassador to France. During these times, enslaved people in the Hemings family were allowed to come and go as they wanted. The Hemings men lived almost like free black men: They could find jobs where they wanted and keep all the money they earned.\nWhen Jefferson came back from Paris, he wanted his butler, Martin Hemings, to stay at Monticello. But Hemings had been used to living his own life. He \"ran away\" from Monticello many times. Sometimes he stayed away for months, working another job somewhere else. But someone always caught him and brought him back.\nIn 1792, Thomas Jefferson wrote that he and Martin Hemings had had a disagreement or fight. He did not say what the fight was. He told one of his managers at Monticello that he and Martin Hemings had agreed on what to do: Jefferson would sell Martin Hemings to someone else. Martin Hemings was 36 or 37 at the time. Jefferson told the manager that Martin Hemings could choose another master. He said he did not care how much money he got for Hemings, so long as Hemings was gone. He also told the manager that he did not want to free Martin Hemings, the way he would free his half-brothers Robert and James later in their lives.\n \"Martin and myself disagreed when I was last in Virginia insomuch that he desired me to sell him, and I determined to do it, and most irrevocably that he shall serve me no longer. If you could find a master agreeable to him, I should be glad if you would settle that point at any price you please ... Perhaps Martin may undertake to find a purchaser. But I exclude all idea of his own responsibility: and I would wish that the transaction should be finished without delay, being desirous of avoiding all parley with him myself on the subject.\"\nThis means:\n\"Martin and I had such a bad disagreement that he asked me to sell him to someone else. I think I should do it. He should not work for me any more. Please find him another master that he thinks would be good. I don't care about the money. Martin can even choose his new master, but I will not free him. Please find a buyer quickly. I do not want to talk to or argue with Martin about this.\"\nThomas Jefferson's letters and writings about Monticello say that Martin Hemings was still at Monticello in 1795. His writings do not say that Jefferson sold Martin Hemings. Then Jefferson's writings stop talking about Hemings altogether. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed thinks Martin Hemings died of natural causes before Jefferson and Hemings could find a buyer."}

Like normal pornography, the aim is to show sexually explicit images, or describe situations which help to sexually arouse women. Most pornography is made for men; it often uses stereotypes. Feminist pornography wants to break out of these stereotyped gender roles. \nDefinition.\nMuch like regular pornography, feminist pornography uses explicit images. Most pornography made for men use shallow stereotypes. Feminist pornography wants to question these stereotypes and the way in which things such as gender, sexuality or beauty are shown. Feminist porn movies often also show disabililty. They do this more often than porn made for men: Feminist porn also shows people who are sexually active, even though they are disabled in some way. Feminist pornography looks at what is considered a normal sexual relationship, and turns against seeing one sex as better than another. More often than pornography produced for men, feninist pornography uses language to produce erotic situations. \nCharacteristics.\nMost feminist porn movies were made in the last few decades. As these movies were made, people also tried to find interpretations for them and to agree on a common set of rules. These interpretations and rules change over time. The last change was made to accommodate the transgender community. In general, feminist porn wants to be seen as diverse and liberal, and to express liberal views on gender and sexuality. \nWith this, feminist pornography creates an aesthetic and ethical vision of change that is neither homogeneous nor clearly defined. Jasmin Hagendorfer, artistic director of the \"Porn Film Festival Vienna\", describes her approach as follows:Feminist porn productions show that the desire and sexual perception of women can very well be the focus and that porn can also be women-, gender- and ultimately men-friendly. In addition, many feminist productions stand for fair working conditions, a say and consensus, which are often not found in mainstream productions. It is important to show that porn is produced by women for women and that it will also meet a wide audience. \nCriticism.\nChristopher Boulton says that criticism of feminist pornography comes from religion, government policy, and feminism itself. The positions of these movements are very similar. The different movements want to reach them with different means, though. One of the critics is the organization Stop Porn Culture. Its main proponent is Gail Dines. According to her, the porn movement in western society is bad, especially the protection of children, and of public health. The means are very similar to those opponents of pornography used in the 1970s and 1980s. \nEconomics.\nLike with the mainstream porn industry, the main interests of feminist pornography are about earning money. Many of the movies are produced as independent movies. Big movie companies like Vivid Entertainment, Adam and Eve and Evil Angel Productions finance and distribute feminist pornography. Feminists deal with this in different ways: Some feminists are opposed to the big companies financing or distributing the movies. Most feminists live with the fact. Courtney Trouble said she would portray almost any character in her films if the demand was there. Only in this way would she be able to get enough money for the projects in which she could show her own ideas, which are different from the mainstream. For example, she would take on the role of a Big Beautiful Woman, although she rejects this term for herself. In her view, Capitalist value creation is a means to an end."}

She was also Queen of Portugal during her husband's brief reign as King Dom Pedro\u00a0IV from 10 March to 2 May 1826.\nShe was born \"Caroline Josepha Leopoldine Franziska Ferdinanda of Habsburg-Lorraine, Archduchess of Austria\" in Vienna, Austria, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Among her many siblings were Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte.\nThe education Maria Leopoldina had received in childhood and adolescence was eclectic and broad, with a higher cultural level and more consistent political training. Such education of the little princes and princesses of the Habsburg family was based on the educational belief initiated by their grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who believed \"that children should be inspired from an early age to have high qualities, such as humanity, compassion and the desire to make people happy\". With a deep Christian faith and a solid scientific and cultural background (which included international politics and notions of government) the Archduchess had been prepared from an early age to being a proper royal consort.\nIn the 21st century, it has been proposed by some historians that she was one of the main articulators of the process of Independence of Brazil that took place in 1822. Her biographer, historian Paulo Rezzutti, maintains that it was largely thanks to her that Brazil became a nation. According to him, the wife of Dom Pedro \"embraced Brazil as her country, Brazilians as her people and Independence as her cause\". She was also adviser to Dom Pedro on important political decisions that reflected the future of the nation, such as the \"Dia do Fico\" and the subsequent opposition and disobedience to the Portuguese courts regarding the couple's return to Portugal. Consequently, for governing the country on Dom Pedro's trips through the Brazilian provinces, she is considered the first woman to become head of state in an independent American country."}

His followers believe that, according to the Gospels, he was the Son of God and that he died for the forgiveness of sins and was raised from the dead and exalted by God, and will return soon at the inception of God's kingdom.\nThe earliest followers of Jesus were apocalyptic Jewish Christians. The inclusion of gentiles in the developing early Christian Church caused a schism between Judaism and Jewish Christianity during the first two centuries of the Christian Era. In 313, Emperor Constantine I issued the Edict of Milan legalizing Christian worship. In 380, with the Edict of Thessalonica put forth under Theodosius I, the Roman Empire officially adopted Trinitarian Christianity as its state religion, and Christianity established itself as a predominantly Roman religion in the state church of the Roman Empire. Christological debates about the human and divine nature of Jesus consumed the Christian Church for two centuries, and seven ecumenical councils were called to resolve these debates. Arianism was condemned at the First Council of Nicea (325), which supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the Nicene Creed."}

It was a city that became famous for its resistance against the Roman armies.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe first human settlements in Numantia were established in the III millennium BC. Shepherds who made seasonal movements with their flocks inhabited this area. The area had a harsh climate but the pastures were rich.\nTowards the 8th century BC., handmade ceramics were used in this settlement. From the 7th century BC., the settlement became a \"castro\". Around 350 BC., Numantia had many inhabitants and was born as a city. \nRoman authors don't agree on the people that lived there. Pliny the Elder believed it was the Pellendones. However, other authors, like Strabo and Ptolemy say in their writings that the city belongs to the Arevaci people.\nRoman conquest.\nIn 153 BC, Numantia had its first serious conflict with Rome.\nAfter 20 years of fighting, in 133 BC, the Roman Senate gave Scipio Aemilianus Africanus the task of destroying Numantia.\nAfter 13 months of siege, the Numantians decided to burn the city before surrendering. The few survivors were sold as slaves. \nNumantia was rebuilt in the time of Augustus.

She was the oldest child of Elizabeth \"Betty\" Hemings. History does not say who her father was, but it was not John Wayles. Mary Hemings was the half-sister of Sally Hemings and James Hemings. For part of her life, she was enslaved to Thomas Jefferson.\nFamily history and early life.\nAccording to Mary Hemings' nephew, Madison Hemings, Mary Hemings' grandmother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include \"Dinah,\" \"Judy,\" \"Abbie,\" \"Sarah,\" \"Parthenia,\" and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named \"Thenia\" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that \"Sally\" is a nickname for \"Sarah,\" and there were many girls named \"Sarah\" and \"Sally\" in the Hemings family too.\nMary Hemings' mother was called Elizabeth \"Betty\" Hemings. Mary Hemings' nephew Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.\nCaptain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says \"about 1735.\" \nElizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.\nElizabeth Hemings had many children. Mary Hemings was the oldest. History does not say who her father was. John Wayles was the father of most of Elizabeth Hemings' other children.\nWhen Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Mary Hemings was 19 or 20 years old.\nLater life.\nMary Hemings had four children while she lived at Monticello. Her son Joseph Fosset might have been then son of a free white man named William Fossett who also lived at Monticello. Historians do not know for sure what their relationship was like, but most of them think that if she named her son \"Fosset,\" she must have liked him.\nThomas Jefferson gave Mary Hemings' two oldest children away. Daniel went to live with Jefferson's sister and Molly went to live with his daughter.\nWhen Thomas Jefferson was in Paris as the United States Ambassador to France, Mary Hemings worked for a man named Thomas Bell who lived in Charlottesville, Virginia. She brought her children Joseph and Betsy with her. She had two more children at Bell's house. In 1792, Mary Hemings asked Thomas Jefferson to sell her to Bell, and he did. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed says this was a normal thing for Jefferson to do: To sell an enslaved person so they could live in the same place as someone else in their family. She writes that Jefferson knew Bell was the father of Hemings' young children but did not talk about it. He wrote to his manager, Nicholas Lewis, saying to \"dispose of Mary according to her desire, with such of her younger children as she chose.\" He meant that Bell could buy Mary Hemings and his own children but not Mary Hemings' other children. They could not stay and live with Bell and their half-siblings. They had to go back to Monticello without their mother.\nMary lived with Bell until he died in 1800. He did not legally free her but he did unofficially free her. In his will, he left his property to their children. He wrote his will as if Mary and his children were free, and his neighbors respected it.\nChildren.\nWhen Jefferson sold Mary Hemings to Thomas Bell, he did not let her keep her older children with her. They went back to his house at Monticello.\nChildren with earlier partners:\nChildren with Thomas Bell:"}

So Elizabeth Hamings' mother's white name was probably Parthenia or Sarah.\nMadison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner when she was born. Even though he offered the owner a lot of money, the owner still said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.\nCaptain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says \"about 1735.\"\nElizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.\nElizabeth Hemings lived as a house servant. That means she did not grow tobacco or cotton in the fields like other enslaved people in Virginia did. Historians think that Elizabeth Hemings' job with the Wayles family was to help raise Martha Wayles, later Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson. After Johyn Wayles' wife died, he made Elizabeth Hemings his concubine, which means they had a sexual relationship but he did not free her or marry her. Historians do not know how Elizabeth Hemings felt about this.\nWhen Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Historians think Elizabeth Hemings took care of Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson when she became sick and that she was there when she died.\nLater life.\nIn the last years of her life, Elizabeth Hemings moved to a small house partway down the mountain, away from the main house of Monticello and from her children and grandchildren. She lived next to free working families. She raised vegetables and chickens. Later, archaeologists would find that she owned many pieces of good porcelain China.\nElizabeth Hemings died at the age of 72. According to Madison Hemings, he was three years old, and he tried to give her some bread to eat. Elizabeth Hemings' last words to him were, \"Granny don't want bread no more.\"\nChildren.\nJohn Wayles was the father of six of Elizabeth Hemings' children. After moving to Monticello, Elizabeth Hemings also had at least one child with Joseph Neilson, a white carpenter who worked for Thomas Jefferson.\nChildren with an unknown partner, probably a black man:\nChildren with John Wayles:\nChildren with Joseph Neilson, known:\nChildren with Joseph Neilson, possible:"}

The title refers to the recess period during the daily schedule, in the North American tradition of educational schooling, when students are not in lessons and are outside in the schoolyard.

He was one of the earliest of the California Scene Painting artists and helped define the art movement. Many of his large-scale building-mounted mosaics from the mid-20th century are still extant in Southern California. His paintings are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum in New York, the Chicago Art Institute, the National Gallery in Washington D.C.; and the Los Angeles County Museum.\nEarly life and education.\nMillard Sheets was born June 24, 1907, and grew up in the Pomona Valley, east of Los Angeles. He is the son of John Gosper Sheets and (1878 \u2013 1947) and Marilla Mae Owen (1883 \u2013 1907). He attended the Chouinard Art Institute and studied with painters Frank Tolles Chamberlin and Clarence Hinkle. While he was still a teenager, his watercolors were accepted for exhibition in the annual California Water Color Society show. By the age of 19, he was elected into membership of the California Water Color Society. The following year he was hired to teach watercolor painting even before his graduation from Chouinard.\nCareer.\nIn 1929 he won second prize in the Texas Wildflowers Competitive Exhibitions, and the generous award allowed Sheets to travel to Europe for a year to further his art education. By the early 1930s he began to achieve national recognition as a prominent American artist. He was exhibiting in Paris, New York City, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Houston, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Baltimore, and many other cities throughout the United States. In Los Angeles he was recognized as the leading figure and driving force behind the California Style watercolor movement.\nBetween 1935 and 1941, his recognition, awards, and output increased, winning him repeated mention in \"Art Digest\" and a color reproduction of his work in the book \"Eyes on America\". In 1935 at age 28, he was the subject of a monograph published in Los Angeles. His art sales enabled him to travel again to Europe, Central America, and Hawaii, where he painted on location. Although his watercolor techniques during this period ranged from very tight to very loose, a consistent, he nevertheless exhibited a personal style.\nDuring World War II, he was an artist-correspondent for \"Life Magazine\" and the United States Army Air Forces in India and Burma. Many of his works from this period document the scenes of famine, war, and death that he witnessed. His wartime experience also informed his post-war art for a number of years, where while painting in California and Mexico in the 1940s his work followed dark hues and depressing subjects. After the 1950s his style shifted toward brighter colors and subjects from his worldwide travels.\nWatercolor and oil painting were only part of Sheets's art career. Through his teaching at Chouinard Art Institute, Otis Art Institute, Scripps College and other institutions, hundreds of artists learned how to paint, and were then guided into art careers. He directed the art exhibition at the Los Angeles County Fair for many years and brought world-class work to Southern California. During the Great Depression, he joined forces with Edward Bruce to hire artists for the Public Works of Art Project, the first New Deal art project. In 1946, he served as a president of the California Water Color Society. In later years, he worked as an architect, illustrator, muralist, printmaker, and art exhibition juror.\nOutside of California, he took on commissions for the Detroit Public Library, the Mayo Clinic, the dome of the National Shrine, the University of Notre Dame library, the Hilton Hotel in Honolulu, and the Mercantile National Bank in Dallas.\nIn 1953, Sheets was appointed director of Otis Art Institute (later named Otis College of Art and Design). Under his leadership, the school's academic program was restructured to offer BFA and MFA degrees, and a ceramics department was created, headed by Peter Voulkos. During that time, a ceramics building, gallery, library, and studio wing were completed. By the time Sheets left Otis in 1962, the form and direction of the college had changed dramatically.\nMillard Sheets Art Center.\nThe Millard Sheets Art Center first began as the Fine Arts Program of the Los Angeles County Fair in 1922. The 20,000+ square-foot art center was built in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration to house the program, the first major gallery dedicated solely to art in Los Angeles County. Each year, the gallery provided visitors to the Los Angeles County Fair with access to art work found throughout the world. In 1994 the building was dedicated to Millard Sheets and in 2013 was identified by Fairplex as the home for year-round art education and exhibitions and is currently a part of The Learning Centers at Fairplex.\nWork.\nMosaic murals at Home Savings Bank branches.\nIn the late 1950s, Sheets was commissioned by Howard F. Ahmanson to design Home Savings Bank branches throughout Southern California that would serve as community landmarks by expressing \"community values\" or presenting \"a celebratory version of the community history.\" To accomplish this goal, Sheets designed his branch buildings with exterior fa\u00e7ades containing large mosaic works depicting local heritage.\nThe Ahmanson commissions multiplied to include more than 80 branch buildings after the initial 1955 commission. Sheets resigned his teaching position at Scripps College and established the Sheets Studio in Claremont, California, employing a series of artists.\nSheets produced these mosaics as commercial commissions, and he rarely titled them. Nevertheless, they are now considered official public art and are titled by their images or theme. Although they enjoy some protections under the California Arts Preservation Act, many have been destroyed. The following Sheets Studio mosaics in Southern California have survived deterioration and demolition:\nDeath.\nSheets died on March 31, 1989 at his home in Anchor Bay in Mendocino County, California after a long illness. A service was held at his home and at the First unitarian Church of San Diego."}

{"id": "872346", "revid": "997261", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=872346", "title": "Charles Reid", "text": "Charles Clark Reid (August12,1937 June1,2019) was an American painter, illustrator, and teacher, notable for his watercolor style. He has won numerous national and international awards for both his watercolor and oil works, and also hosted many workshops in the US and abroad. He has had numerous books published, instructional DVDs and created a postage stamp and an iconic ad campaign with his watercolor depictions. His watercolor works and oil paintings are in private and college museum collections.\nEarly life.\nReid became interested in painting at the age of 14 when his parents encouraged him by letting him use a room in the family home for his art. His father gave him illustrated history books and books about Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington, both known for their paintings of the American Old West. Reid's father enrolled him in a correspondence course at the Famous Artists School, when he was 16 years old. Reid also attended South Kent School and the University of Vermont (1955-1957).\nDisillusioned while at the University of Vermont he enrolled in the Art Students League of New York, while in Manhattan from 1957 to 1959. He met Frank J. Reilly there, who became his teacher.\nHe was invited to exhibit in New York City at the ROKO Gallery and at the FAR Gallery during 10 years in the 70s until its closure in 1979.\nRecognition and honors.\nAlthough not a member of the American Watercolor Society, they exhibited Reid's work four times: in 1973 with \"Sleeping Girl,\" in 1975 with \"Miss Goodman\", in 1978 with \"Narda,\" and in 1984 with \"Mary\". Reid won the Samuel J. Bloomingdale Memorial Award with \"Miss Goodman\" and the High Winds Award with \"Narda.\"\nIn 1975, he won the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Childe Hassam, Speicher, Betts, and Symons Purchase Fund Award with \"Wally.\" He won the same award again in 1976 with \"In the Studio.\"\nIn 1975, he was admitted as an Associate at the American National Academy of Design, and in 1983 he became an Academician.\nHe joined the National Academy of Design in 1980.\nIn 1983, he was awarded a silver medal from the Society of Illustrators.\nIn 1988 he joined the Century Association.\nIn 2013, he won a gold medal at the annual Portrait Society of America, \"The Art of The Portrait\" International Conference. The Gold Medal is awarded to \"individuals whose work has revolutionized the practice and influenced others\". Reid also won \"The Purchase Award\" at the second \"Shanghai Zhujiajiao International Watercolor Biennial Exhibition\" (also called Shanghai International Biennial Exhibition) in 2013.\nHe has been exhibited in major institutions including The Butler Institute of Fine Art and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nPublic collections.\nReid's works are found:\nInfluences.\nCharles Reid was a pupil of Frank Reilly who was tutored by professor of drawing George Bridgman and by Franck-Vincent DuMond, both of whom were influenced and connected to the French academic style of the late 19th century. Reilly passed on these influences to Reid. Both Bridgman and DuMond had studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts de Paris and at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian.\nReid received teachings based on the contributions of the great pictorial movements and his art is influenced by French impressionists like Edouard Manet, whose simplification of forms he appreciated. As Amanda Apostol said he also refers to the Nabis and particularly Edouard Vuillard, Pierre Bonnard, and Toulouse Lautrec, who Reid also counts among his favorite painters. He took from them the use of pure colors for half and midtones values, and the absence of a center of interest.\nReid was also influenced by American post-impressionists such as John Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer and the more contemporary Fairfield Porter, Andrew Wyeth and Joan Mitchell.\nTraining.\nWhile on his honeymoon in Madeira, he met George Jacobs (1926-2002) who colored pen and ink drawings with watercolor. George Jacob's method of painting with watercolor relies heavily on pen lines. In this early period they took daily van trips, painting street scenes and landscapes with Reid first copying Jacobs' style.\nWhen Reid came back to the US in 1964, at twenty-seven he took a job teaching at the Famous Artists School becoming the youngest instructor employed there. At the time, there had been no watercolor instruction. At the end of 4 years, he was asked to set up a figure class in watercolor with no experience other than the month with George Jacobs. His supervisor, Frank Jones, gave him a brief demonstration of a tugboat, highlighting the wet-in-wet technique, and in how to deal with his edges to improve his watercolor technique. That was enough to help create this weekly figure class.\nHe taught for 10 years at the correspondence school, and he spent each day at the easel. This work served as the basis for his first book \"Figure Painting in Watercolor\". Its publication in 1973 put him in the forefront of people's mind as a watercolorist.\nCharles Reid found inspiration in the fashion illustrations of Dorothy Hood, which he admired for her direct and simple style.\nIn the late 70's and 80's he traveled a great deal and spent time in airports where he developed his contour drawing skill by drawing fellow passengers waiting for flights.\nTechnique.\nHis work was simple and direct. For portraits he used contour drawings to connect the figure to the background. As a pupil of F. Reilly he focused his works on drawing and usage of perfecting tonal value in his painting.\nIn the book by JM Parramon, \"Creative Watercolor\", the author set out the technical elements that establish the singularity of Charles Reid's style. The contour-drawing and his way of applying the color. According to Parramon his paintings show how he \"associates the precision of the form to the ease of the line and the color\".\nHis watercolor technique was unconventional. He painted from mid-darks to lights rather than starting light and going dark. He used alla-prima approach, and didn't glaze, which is the traditional way to paint watercolor. He only glazed sometimes for the features of the figures.\nCharles Reid perceived still life in an abstract way, seeing large splot of light and dark. Then he put paint as a diagram of colors in order to establish the color combination of his painting.\nHe painted directly onto paper, with the intention of getting the right value and color on the first try. This contributes to the sense of spontaneity and freshness to his work. Although not necessarily happy with mistakes, he considered them to be essential in retaining a sense of freshness, suggesting things are \"alive\".\nContrary to what his style suggests, he worked in a meticulous manner avoiding overworking, each brushstroke counts, and he deals with edges. He considers painting a \"happening\", like jazz. To \"American Artist\" he said, \"The more you know the more you can improvise\". He starts each painting like a new experience, pretending he does not know how to paint.\nHe looked at his watercolors more as poems that are completed after an hour or two, whereas his oils were like novels that required a more detailed depiction of the scene. Reid was a studio painter and a plein-air painter, but he tended to prefer the warmth of the south light, thinking it worked well for him.\nCollaborations.\nOn March 18, 1972, Reid was the first to design an 8 cent US Postal Service stamp that highlighted Family Planning, issued in New York City. It's a vertical stamp showing a family group (husband, wife, daughter and son) walking forward. His inspiration for the painting came from a family photograph.\nHe painted the illustration for the L.L. Bean Maine Hunting Boot, which has been widely used in advertising in their catalogs, on truck sides and on large cubes throughout stores. The painting also appears on the cover of \"The Making of an American Icon\" by Leon Gorman about his experience as the grandson of the founder of L.L. Bean.\nHe illustrated a limited edition of John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes Of Wrath\" published in 1978 by Franklin Library. \nFurther collaborations appeared in \"American Heritage\", \"Harper's\", \"Sports Afield\", \"Reader's Digest Books\" and the \"Franklin Press.\"\nTeaching.\nAs a teacher, Reid hosted fifteen to twenty workshops a year over thirty-five to forty years. He wrote twelve books, eleven of which are about watercolor. He made nine instructional DVDs:\nHe judged in numerous painting exhibitions as well."}

Barrington Tops is a plateau between two of the large peaks in the range. The park is believed to be an extinct volcano and the mountain ranges are made up of a mixture of sedimentary rocks with a granite top. Erosion has weathered the granite and rounded granite boulders can be seen in some areas of the park. Estimates put the age of the rock at 300 to 400 million years, well before Australia separated from Gondwana. It also forms the watershed between the Hunter and Manning Rivers. Barrington Tops sits on top of a volcano and reaches an altitude of 1586m.\nAt 3 December 1969 the region between \"Mount Barrington\", \"Mount Royal\" and the \"Gloucester Tops was\" declared a national park. Since 1982 the park has been listed as part of the Gondwana rainforests of Australia as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; as such, it is the southernmost of the affiliated national parks.\nHistory.\nThe Barrington Tops area was home to various Aboriginal countries, namely the \"Worimi\" and \"Biripi\" in the east and the \"Wonnarua\" in the west.\nFrom around 1820, European settlers began to settle in the region, using the areas to cut logs and as grazing land for cattle. Gold was also searched here.\nIn the early 20th In the 19th century, tourism became popular through horse riding, hunting and fishing. \"The Barrington Club\", founded in 1948, campaigned for nature conservation. In 1959 the first areas were placed under protection.\nEcosystems.\nThe park includes ecosystems of tropical rainforest in the protected valleys and gorges at heights between 400 and 600 m. At altitudes of 700 to 1400 m there is cool temperate rainforest, where \"Nothofagus moorei\" predominates. This is followed by an alpine zone with alpine woodland and subalpine peat bogs in the summit regions.\nEucalyptus forests with various species predominate across all heights: Sydney and Messmate eucalyptus dominate the valleys and on the slopes, and the southern beech also dominates the higher areas. On the other hand, the cold-resistant snow eucalyptus predominates on the plateau.\nThanks to the remote, inaccessible location of the park, a diverse fauna including some species that have already been considered extinct has been preserved. A butterfly, three spider species, three worm species and the crustacean \"Crenoicus harrisoni\" are endemic to the park.\nEastern gray kangaroos, red-necked wallabies, red-necked filanders and bare-nosed wombats also occur. Nocturnal mammals are also present. Echidna and platypus also find their habitat here. The koala is difficult to observe, the Australian mouse \"Pseudomys oralis is a critically\" endangered species. The Australian wide-toothed rat occurs only in a few places in Australia.\nBirds include lyre-tails, cockatoos, flat-tailed parakeets, kookaburras, strangler crows and grouse. The black cockatoo is rarely seen. The most common reptiles encounted here are the black otter, tiger otter, copper-headed snake and brown snake."}

The path ends at the Woronora Dam, although there are several other entrances to the park around Heathcote and Waterfall.\nHistory.\nBefore the forest area became a park, a group of hikers had leased most of the area. Presumably they created some of the early hiking trails and campsites. The area later became a \"state park\" and again later a national park.\nAboriginals lived in the area and left traces in various places. In addition, a number of European settlers lived during the Great Depression in the 1930s in simple huts, leaving only scant ruins in places like \"Myuna Creek\" back \nGeography.\nThe park consists of the deeply furrowed Hawkesbury sandstone plateau, part of the \" Woronora Plateau \". \"Heathcote Creek\", a tributary of the Woronora River, is found in a gorge. The sandstone is about 200 million Years old and has been around for around 94 million Years ago. After each period of land uplift, the watercourses dug into the sandstone.

During Classical Antiquity, several Illyrian tribes lived in Albania. They were the Ardiaei, Albanoi, Amantini, Enchele and Taulantii. There were also Thracian and Greek tribes, as well as several Greek colonies established on the Illyrian coast.\nIn the 3rd century BC, Rome conquered the area. It became part of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia, Macedonia and Moesia Superior. The territory remained under Roman and Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century. The Bulgarian Empire conquered it in the 9th century.\nThe Principality of Arb\u00ebr and a Sicilian union known as the medieval Kingdom of Albania were established in the Middle Ages. Some areas became part of the Venetian and later Serbian Empire. Between the mid-14th and the late 15th centuries, most of modern-day Albania was dominated by Albanian principalities. They fell to the rapid invasion of the Ottoman Empire. Albania remained under Ottoman control as part of the province of Rumelia until 1912. After a short occupation by the Kingdom of Serbia, the first independent Albanian state was founded by the Albanian Declaration of Independence. An Albanian national consciousness was formed in the later 19th century. It is part of the larger phenomenon of the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire.\nThe short-lived Principality of Albania (1914\u20131925) was succeeded by an even shorter-lived first Albanian Republic (1925\u20131928). Another monarchy, the Kingdom of Albania (1928\u20131939), replaced the republic. The country endured occupation by Italy just before World War II. After the collapse of the Axis powers, Albania became the Socialist People's Republic of Albania. It was a communist state. Enver Hoxha governed it most of its duration (died 1985). his political succesor Ramiz Alia oversaw the disintegration of the communist state. This happened during the wider collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the later 1980s.\nThe communist regime collapsed in 1990. The former communist Party of Labour of Albania was defeated in elections in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest. The unstable economic situation led to an Albanian diaspora during the 1990s. The crisis peaked in the Albanian Turmoil of 1997. Albania was able to join the NATO in 2009 thanks to the improved economic and political conditions. The country is applying to join the European Union."}

This was the buffer states created by Charlemagne to keep the Islamic Moors from advancing into Christian France. According to the tradition, Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the Moors. In the 9th century, Charlemagne's grandson, Charles the Bald, named the Count of Urgell as overlord of Andorra. A descendant of the count later gave the lands to the Diocese of Urgell.\nIn the 11th century, the Bishop of Urgell placed himself under the protection of the Lord of Caboet, a Catalan nobleman. Later, the Count of Foix became heir to the Lord of Caboet through marriage in 1208. A dispute arose between the Occitan Count and the Catalan bishop over Andorra.\nIn 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a pareage (pariatges). This stated that Andorra's sovereignty was shared between the Count of Foix and the Bishop of La Seu d'Urgell (Catalonia). The pareage gave the small state its territory and political form. In return, Andorra pays an annual tribute or questia to the co-rulers consisting of four hams, forty loaves of bread, and some wine. Andorra's borders have remained unchanged since 1278.\nAndorra was briefly annexed to the Crown of Aragon twice, in 1396 and 1512."}

It is located 29 kilometres south of Sydney and is part of the Sydney metropolitan area.\nHistory.\nThe national park was founded in 1879 by Sir John Robertson, then premier of New South Wales, making it the second oldest national park in the world after Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Sir John Robertson cared for and supported him all the rest of his life. After coal was discovered on the terrain, it was founded out of economic interests to keep competition away from the gates of Sydney. Its original name was \"The National Park\" . In 1955 it was renamed after a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. The park is repeatedly ravaged by bushfires, which contribute to the constant change and regeneration of the vegetation. Plants like the native Waratah are adapted to the environmental factor fire and need the fires to bloom in subsequent years.\nLocation.\nThe park is partly in the Sydney and Wollongong administrative districts and forms a jewel with unspoiled nature between these two major cities. It is bounded to the north by the Port Hacking fjord, to the west by the motorway between the cities and to the south to Otford. The Heathcote National Park connects across the freeway and continues the green belt around Sydney.\nThe Royal National Park offers very different landscapes and vegetation. It lies on sandstone hills that break off a few hundred meters down to the coast. They are mostly covered by eucalyptus forests with a wealth of species. Centrally, deeply cut, the Hacking River runs through the park, which flows into the seawater of Port Hacking at Audley. This rugged bay offers protection from the open sea. The water at Bundeena is very shallow and is home to an extensive mangrove forest . There are a few beaches and lagoons on the open coast to the Tasman Sea. Most of them can only be reached on foot via the coastal footpath. Wattamolla can be approached and offers ample picnic and barbecue facilities. In the southeast the forest merges into the subtropical rainforest of the Illawarra Escarpment, in which there are also palm trees.\nAccess.\nAccess by car is via three routes, north from Sutherland, west from Waterfall and south from Otford via Stanwell Park . A daily or annual fee is required, which can be purchased at various points of sale as well as on NSW national parks website."}

The park has a size of 326\u00a0km\u00b2 and is distributed over the three areas; Cape du Couedic and Rocky River, Gosse Lands and the Cape Borda Lighthouse in the west of the island. The park was founded in 1919. The closest town is Kingscote, about 110\u00a0km away.\nThe main attractions of the park are the bizarre rocks of the \"Remarkable Rocks\", the colonies of fur seals at \"Admirals Arch\", and the lighthouse at Cape Borda from 1858. There are also numerous kangaroos and koalas in the park.\nWildlife.\nNew Zealand fur seals, Australian fur seals and Australian sea lions can be found along the coast of the park. Showy land mammals are kangaroos, which are represented by two species. On the one hand by a special island subspecies of the western grey giant kangaroo and on the other hand by the derby wallaby . A purely endemic terrestrial mammal species found nowhere else on the island is the Kangaroo Island narrow-footed pouch mouse . At other mammals come koalas, platypus, pseudocheiridae, common brushtail possum, Small short-nosed bandicoot \"(Isodon oesulus obesulus),\" Tasmanian cercartetus, thin tail cercartetus, swamp rats \"(Rattus lutreolus),\" also a subspecies of the Australian bush rat \"(Rattus fuscipes greyi)\" and a special island subspecies of the short-billed hedgehog. In addition, eight species of bats live in the park.\nThe koalas, platypus and ring-baggers were introduced from mainland Australia. The number of koalas has increased so much in recent years that many eucalyptus forests have been severely damaged. The national park administration tries to cope with the situation with sterilisation programs. In the national park there are also some species that do not belong to the original Australian fauna. These are goats, fallow deer, pigs, house cats, house rats and house mice .\nThe kangaroo island emu was once endemic to the island, but in the 19th Century extinct. Reptiles are represented by Rosenberg's monitor lizard, dwarf copper head, black tiger otter, striped fin foot, various skinks, geckos and an agame (\"Ctenophorus decresii\"). Six species of frog are at home in the park. The leatherback turtle is found on the coasts.\nBushfires.\nAt 6 December 2007, lightning bolts ignited a bushfire in which 19,542\u00a0ha bush burned in the national park. This corresponds to 60% of the total area.\nEven bigger fires raged over the turn of the 2019/2020 bushfire season, which destroyed around a quarter in the west of the island. The bushfires also largely destroyed Flinders Chase National Park, including the visitor centre. Much of the rare wildlife was also a victim of the flames."}
{"id": "872650", "revid": "508885", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=872650", "title": "Hemings family", "text": "The Hemings family was a group of people who lived in Virginia. They were Elizabeth Hemings and her children and other descendants. They were enslaved people, meaning some of their ancestors had been kidnapped in Africa and brought over the Atlantic Ocean in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Some of them became free later. For part of their history, they were enslaved to the Eppes family, to the Wayles family, and to Thomas Jefferson. The Hemingses were the largest family to live at Monticello.\nBeginning.\nAccording to Elizabeth Hemings' grandson, Madison Hemings, her mother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include \"Dinah,\" \"Judy,\" \"Abbie,\" \"Sarah,\" \"Parthenia,\" and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named \"Thenia\" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia, also spelled Parthena. But she also says that \"Sally\" is a nickname for \"Sarah,\" and there were many girls named \"Sarah\" and \"Sally\" in the Hemings family too. So Elizabeth Hamings' mother's white name was probably Parthenia or Sarah.\nMadison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner when she was born. Even though he offered the owner a lot of money, the owner still said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.\nCaptain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says \"about 1735.\"\nElizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.\nElizabeth Hemings lived as a house servant. That means she did not grow tobacco or cotton in the fields like other enslaved people in Virginia did. Historians think that Elizabeth Hemings' job with the Wayles family was to help raise Martha Wayles, later Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson. After Johyn Wayles' wife died, he made Elizabeth Hemings his concubine, which means they had a sexual relationship but he did not free her or marry her. Historians do not know how Elizabeth Hemings felt about this.\nWhen Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Historians think Elizabeth Hemings took care of Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson when she became sick and that she was there when she died.\nHabits.\nThe Hemingses were known for pooling resources. That means that if one of them had money or other good things, they would share it with the others. They also had what historian Annette Gordon-Reed calls a \"mania\" for naming their children after each other. A mother would name her children after her own sisters or brothers.\nThomas Jefferson wrote a lot, so historians know more about the Hemingses who lived on Monticello than about many other enslaved people. We know that six of Elizabeth Hemings' children were Martha Jefferson's half-brothers and half-sisters because they had the same father: John Wayles. We do not know what Martha Jefferson or the Hemingses thought about this. We do know that Robert and James Hemings helped Martha Jefferson and her daughters escape from British soldiers during the Revolutionary War. We do not know whether the Hemings men thought of themselves as two men helping their sister and nieces, as two men helping their master's wife and daughters, as both, or as neither one.\nThomas Jefferson trusted many people in the Hemings family. When he was away from Monticello, he would allow the Hemings men to leave, choose other people for whom to work, and keep all their wages. The law of Virginia at the time said he did not have to do this. Jefferson freed several people in the Hemings family. He did not get along with all the Hemingses. He had a fight with Martin Hemings.\nJefferson was not always happy to free enslaved people. When Robert Hemings asked to make a deal with Jefferson for his freedom, Jefferson was not happy about it. He said that Robert had been lured away from him. After freeing Robert, Jefferson stopped letting his enslaved people travel so much. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed writes that she thinks Jefferson figured out that letting enslaved people live as if they were free made them want to be free for real. It also let them learn things about the outside world.\nFamily.\nElizabeth Hemings' children with an unknown partner, probably a black man:\nElizabeth Hemings' children with John Wayles:\nElizabeth Hemings' children with Joseph Neilson, known:\nElizabeth Hemings' children with Joseph Neilson, possible:"}

She was a poet from Maharashtra. She is known as the \"first female teacher of India\". She worked on improving the rights of women in India with her husband. Her husband's name was Jyotirao Phule. They started the first Indian girls school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. She tried to end social class and unfair treatment based on sex in Indian society. She was an important person of the social reform in Maharashtra.\nEarly life.\nSavitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 in the village of Naigaon in Satara District, Maharashtra. Her birthplace was about from Shirval and about from Pune. Savitribai Phule was the oldest daughter of Lakshmi (her mother) and Khandoji Nevase Patil (her father). They were from the Mali Community. Savitribai and Jotirao did not have any children of their own. It is said that they took Yashawant in their family. Yashawant was the son of a Brahmin woman whose husband had died.\nCareer.\nAt the time of marriage, Savitribai was not able to read or write. Jyotirao taught Savitribai at their home.&lt;ref name=\"O'Hanlon 2002 https://archive.org/details/casteconflictide00ohan/page/n131 118\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She completed her primary education with Jyotirao. She registered herself in two training programs to become a teacher. Later, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at the Maharwada in Pune. Soon Savitribai and with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide Wada. Sagunabai was a coach of Jyotirao Phule. Tatya Saheb Bhide was inspired by these works. School course at Bhide Wada included traditional western course of mathematics, science, and social studies. By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three different schools for girls in Pune. These three schools had almost one hundred and fifty students registered. Teaching of these three schools was better than government schools. As a result of this, the number of girls in these schools went up to the number of boys in government schools.\nSavitribai and Jyotirao Phule's success came with much oppose. The opposers were the persons who did not like change. The Phules faced strong opposition from powerful castes (Brahmin) because they belonged to the week caste (Mali). Education was not for the Sudra castes for thousands of years. For this reason, Brahmins started to oppose works of Jyotirao and Savitribai. Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were living at home of father of Jyotirao til 1849. Father of Jyotirao asked them to leave his home In 1849 because their work was a sin as per the Manusmriti and Brahmanical texts.\nThey moved in the family of Usman Sheikh. Usman Sheikh was a friend of Jyotirao. In the 1850s, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule established two educational trusts - The Native Female School, Pune and the Society for Promoting the Education of Mahars, Mangs, and Etceteras. These two trusts had many schools of Savitribai Phule.\nJyotirao talked about Savitribai and his work in an interview. This interview was given to the Christian missionary periodical, Dnyanodaya, on 15 September 1853. He said\nShe taught children from different castes. She opened a total of 18 schools with her husband. They also opened a care centre called Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha (literally, \"Child-killing Prohibition Home\") for pregnant rape victims. Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha helped deliver and save their children.\nDeath.\nSavitribai and her adopted son, Yashwant, opened a clinic. This clinic was for the victims of an outbreak of the bubonic plague (Third Pandemic). The clinic was in Pune. Savitribai died a heroic death. She tried to save the son of Pandurang Babaji Gaekwad. She came to know that Gaekwad's son had got the plague. Savitribai Phule ran to him. She carried him on her back to the hospital. In the process, she was infected. She died at 9:00pm on 10 March 1897.\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations"}

The first season started in Cuttack in October 2016. The league is run by the All India Football Federation (AIFF).\nHistory.\nSince 1991, the top women's football tournament in India has been the Indian Women's Football Championship. The tournament served as a female version of the Santosh Trophy, with states competing against each other. There had never been a national football league for women; however, leagues were started by state associations for women. The first women's state football league was set up in 1976 in Manipur. The Indian Football Association of West Bengal founded the Calcutta Women's League in 1993. Leagues were also started in Mumbai and Goa in 1998 and 1999.\nIn 2014, after the success of the India women's team, mainly in the SAFF Women's Championship, a push to start a women's football league, mainly along the lines of the successful Indian Super League, started. Clubs such as Pune and Bengaluru FC had interest in joining a women's league. It was around this time that the All India Football Federation started plans to create the ISL-style league for women.\nOn 21 April 2016, over a year after the AIFF made plans for a women's football league, the AIFF President, Praful Patel, said that a women's football league would start in October 2016 with six teams to be decided, with the goal to expand to eight teams by 2017. Just over two months later, on 5 July 2016, the AIFF organized a meeting to discuss the India women's national team and discuss the proposed women's football league. Five Indian Super League sides (Delhi Dynamos, Chennaiyin FC, Kerala Blasters, FC Pune City, Atletico de Kolkata) and three I-League teams (Bengaluru FC, Aizawl FC, Mumbai FC) attended the meeting. It was declared that the league would feature the eight teams in the league and two other spots would be decided through a pre-qualification round.\nOn 14 October, the AIFF declared that the preliminary rounds for the Women's League would begin on 17 October 2016 in which ten teams would split into two groups of five teams each, with the winner from each group qualifying for the national finals.\nSeasons.\nSeason 1 (2016\u201317).\nOn 24 January 2017, AIFF began the first ever women's professional league with six teams.

The park also includes \"Fletchers Glen\", one of the last remaining temperate rainforests on the central stretch of the New South Wales coast.\nOriginally the park was called \"Bouddi Natural Park\". It got its name at the second Park Association meeting in 1936. Other names that were under discussion were \"Maitland Bay Park\", \"Cape Three Points Reserve,\" and \"Gerrinbombi Park\" . The reason for the choice of the name was the fact that Bouddi was documented as an Aboriginal name for this area, since it appeared in maps from 1828. The park association was formed the year before to administer the park and had members from the \"NSW Federation of Bushwalking Clubs\" and the \"Erina Shire Council\".\nIn 1967 the then 530 hectare park was rededicated as a national park and renamed Bouddi State Park, according to the legislation that had just come into force. Management passed to the NSW National Park and Wildlife Service and shortly thereafter the parks association was transformed into an advisory committee. On the 1st January 1974 the National Park and Wildlife Act dropped the State Park category and the park was renamed Bouddi National Park."}

The natural world heritage area contains 26 caves on 3.05\u00a0km\u00b2 area.\nFacilities and sights.\nThe park is a tourist attraction and has a campground, RV park, group accommodation, picnic areas and a cafe.

With the help of modern technology, visitors can be shown the inside of the normally inaccessible \"Bat Cave\", where thousands of bats breed every year. There are also cave tours for adventurers, a number of special tours and special events.\nEmergence.\nThe limestone in the area was formed by corals and other marine life 200 million years ago when it was below sea level and again about 20 million years ago when the land was again below sea level. Since then, groundwater has loosened part of the limestone, creating the caves. These caves, like the \"Victoria Fossil Cave\" or the \"Blanche Cave\", are often not far underground and holes opened up that posed dangers to the unwary. This created a remarkable collection of fossils. Mammals and other land creatures fell into the open holes and were unable to escape. The fossils were preserved in banks of earth washed and blown from the surface of the earth. In some places the fossil-bearing layer is up to 20\u00a0m thick.

The park is about 60\u00a0km west of the town of Hillston and 170\u00a0km northwest of Griffith.\nLandscape and climate.\nWillandra National Park was established in 1972 and covers an area of approximately 19,385 hectares. It consists of 13.85\u00a0km\u00b2 of flat grassland bounded to \"the north by Willandra Creek\", which connects the Lachlan River with the Darling River.\nThe land around the national park is mainly used as extensive pasture for sheep and cattle. Most of the roads in this area are unpaved and become slippery or even impassable even with light rainfall. The climate is semi-arid with very hot summers and cold winters. The park is located on the northern edge of the Riverina plain.\nHistory.\nIt is believed that Aboriginal colonisation dates back at least 15,000 years. The Willandra Creek was roughly the border between the settlement areas of the \"Wiradjuri\" in the south and the \"Wongaibon\" in the north.\nThe first European settlers came in the 1830s. Initially, the white colonisation by sheep breeders was sparse and allowed the Aborigines to continue their accustomed way of life. But in the 1870s and early 1880s, extensive fencing, building, and river regulation programs began as the first phase of permanent white settlement. In 1894, Willandra became the property of the \"London Bank of Melbourne\" after the \"Whittington Brothers\"' corporate empire, who had previously owned the country, collapsed in the economic crisis of the 1890s. Under the management of \"Arthur\" and \"Frank Laird\", Willandra became a well-known sheep breeding area in the years that followed and the owners won many awards for the high quality of their Merino herds.\nIn 1912 Willandra was sold to the \"Vickery Partnership\" and peaked as a ranching company in the 1920s and 1930s. Up to 90,000 sheep were sheared at once and the land area of the farm reached 1760\u00a0km\u00b2. A new manor house (which still stands today and is available as a guest house) was added in 1918. In the following years more buildings were added. The estate had a tennis court, a croquet court and orchards and has thus become - to this day - a remarkable oasis in an otherwise dry and dusty landscape.\nDespite high wool prices in the 1950s, Willandra's decline as a well-known cattle breeding business began, which was exacerbated by a long drought after WWII. In 1960, the \"New Zealand and Australian Land Company\" bought Willandra and the estate's land area decreased to 721\u00a0km\u00b2. For a while, however, the success came back and the company employed up to 22 people.\n1969 bought \"Dalgety Plc.\" the estate but failed to renew the land leases when they expired in 1971. With the expiry of the leases, the government of New South Wales withdrew the permission to use the crown land and made the area a national park in 1972. The reserve was then managed by the \"NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service\" (now part of the \"Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water\" ). In a major renovation program at the end of the 1990s, the buildings were restored to their old splendor and are now partly used as guest houses.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe park is very level with only a few elevations. For the most part, it is grassland with trees just along the watercourses and around normally dry lakes and valleys. The predominant plant communities are dry eucalyptus forests and grass-rich, light forests. The light forest is dominated by eucalyptus ( \"Black Box\", Eucalyptus largiflorens) and acacias ( \"River Cooba\", Acacia stenophylla). Naturally occurring tree and shrub species that characterize the area include the pittosporum (Pittosporum phylliraeoides), Rosewood (Heterodendrum oleifolium) Hakea leucoptera and Senna eremophila.\nBefore European colonisation began, logs, cotton bushes (Maireana aphylla) and native grasses were probably the most common forms of covering on the plains. Over 100 years of pasture and improvements for sheep breeding have changed this and the plant and animal communities no longer show the conditions as they were before the European settlement. Still, Willandra is an important habitat for many native species, such\u00a0as the emu, the threatened \"Plain hikers,\" red and gray kangaroos, the echidna, the platypus, nine bat species and 23 reptile species, such as the \"Gould's Sand Goanna\" and the \"Mulga Brown Snake.\" "}

It is the largest known Aboriginal fish trap facility in Australia. It is believed to be the oldest human construction in the world although it hasn't been confirmed yet.\nThe fish traps are probably around 40,000 years old, although the exact date is not known. They are around 500\u00a0m long. They are in the Ngunnhu Aboriginal territory. The fish traps consisted of many small stone circles that could be separated by stone weirs. There the fish were led so that they could be caught. The design, complexity and size of the facility are unique in Australia. For this reason they are a national monument.\nBefore the European settlement, the Aboriginals used the river for fishing. Stones were removed from the river by the settlers to allow paddle steamers to travel, and rocks were removed in the 1920s to be used for house foundations and roads. The steamships could not sail in the dry season.\nThe Ngunnhu people had strong social, cultural and spiritual relationships with other Aboriginal groups, and they also allowed other Aboriginal countries to fish according to rules, times and periods. They were associated with the Aborigines of the Kamilaroi, Marowari, Paarkinji, Weilwan, Barbinja and Ualaria. The neighbouring Aboriginal countries were invited by Ngunnhu to cooroborees, ceremonies, initiations, trade and barter.\nThe Ngunnhu attribute the possibility of fishing to the mythical Baiame, a dreamtime creature who created the landscape, lakes, rivers and beings. \nThe plant is partly overgrown by reeds. The fish ladder was opened on June 3 2005 registered in the Australian National Heritage List because it was of particular historical importance for the social and cultural coexistence within the Aboriginals."}

The camp is in the northwest of the island on \"Darling Bay\" in Maria Island National Park, where the former Darlington settlement was located. Since 1825 there was a camp on the island for prisoners who had committed serious crimes. From 1842 to 1850 it was operated as one of two British penal camps, alongside the Cascades Female Factory, as an education camp.\nHistory.\nIn 1825, the second convict colony in Van Diemens Land (now renamed as Tasmania) was established by Governor George Arthur with 50 convicts and a few soldiers on Maria Island, which was closed again in 1832. Despite the short time, several buildings were built, of which the \"Commissariat Store\" and the constructions of the convict camp, known as the \"Penitentiary\", have been preserved.\nThe convicts built a wood, shoe and clothes maker manufacture and tannery. The construction of a mechanised, water-powered clothing manufacture was remarkable. Because of several escape attempts and disciplinary problems, this penal colony was closed in 1832. The Port Arthur prison, which has now been established and could accommodate a large number of convicts, also played a role.\nTen years later, the penal colony was reopened as a prison camp on the initiative of Lieutenant Governor Franklin in 1842, after repairing the existing buildings. When a second station opened, more than 800 convicts came to the island and more buildings were erected. Overcrowding created numerous problems and the stations were closed in 1850.\nAmong the convicts was the Irish nationalist from the Young Ireland movement William Smith O'Brien, two Khoikhoi and five Maori who were detained there because of national conflicts over borders.\nModern use.\nThe camp has been in operation since 1 Registered in the Australian National Heritage List on August 1, 2007 and in, August 2010; one of eleven Australian Convict Sites recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\nThe accommodation station is one of the best preserved prison camp buildings from the early days of the Australian convict colony. There were 78 such camps in Tasmania. There \"are 13 buildings on Maria Island\", some of which have been preserved and some of which are ruins.\nThe buildings on the island reflect the system of labour discipline for convicts in the early British colonial times. In the convict camp there were strict rules and discipline with division into groups and according to training, the exercise of religious coercion and methods of rigid punishment. The \"Darlington Probation Station\" with this form of convict discipline with public work goes back to Franklin (1837 to 1843).\nIn the camp there was a canteen and a classroom, a chapel and buildings for the accommodation of the priest and the religious teachers. The convicts' barracks and ruins were divided into separate rooms for well-behaving and rebellious convicts, where well-behaving convicts were housed in bedrooms and the others in separate rooms. The single cells testify to the practiced method of punishment of isolation."}

The building on \"Macquarie Street\" in Sydney CBD, and is listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List as Australian Convict Sites and on the Australian National Heritage List. The site was intended to house male convicts. Today it is operated as a museum by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.\nThe building is in close proximity to the historic Sydney Mint and Hyde Park.\nHistory.\nGovernor Lachlan Macquarie ordered the construction of brickwork to house convicts until 1838 who had to work for the colonial government of New South Wales. With this building, Macquarie deviated from the previously practiced British colonial policy of creating convict camps in which strict discipline and religious education were practiced, thereby liberalising them. From 1848 to 1886 it was used for young immigrants looking for work and waiting for their families. From 1887 to 1979 it housed courts and government offices.\nIn 1981 the building was restored and today it houses a museum about the history of the convicts. In July 2010 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of a selected set of Australian Convict Sites.\nThe museum can be visited daily with a few exceptions on certain days and certain public holidays."}

The Wild Rivers National Park emerged from the former Frenchmans Cap National Park, which had its borders along the Franklin River. Frenchman's Cap can be seen from afar, best seen from the west side and the north side of the park. The dispute over the Franklin Dam, which was to become part of a large-scale project to supply electricity through hydropower in Tasmania, contributed to the designation of the area in its current size. The project failed due to resistance from the Australian environmental movement in 1983.\nLocation.\nThe park is about 117\u00a0km west of Hobart, between the central highlands and the west coast of Tasmania, in the very heart of the Tasmanian Wilderness which is a UNESCO world heritage site. The only one road that runs through the park, is the Lyell Highway, numbered as A10. This winds 56 kilometres through the park and makes travel inside the park easy.\nHistory.\nThe national park contains numerous sites that point to the early settlement by the Aboriginals and are still of great spiritual importance for the Aboriginal community today. The original inhabitants of Tasmania, who lived in isolation from the inhabitants of the mainland for a really long time, developed a culture that differed from them; through the use of fire they introduced profound changes in the vegetation communities.\nHowever, Europeans invaded the area from around 1822. It was then that Macquarie Harbour penal colony was established on Sarah Island. Convicts who managed to escape tried to escape into the wilderness, but often, many had died in the process. From 1850, many prospectors came to the area.\nLandscape.\nThe landscape is characterised by impressive mountain peaks, beautiful rainforests, deep river valleys and spectacular gorges.\nWildlife.\nThe national park is home to the golden-bellied parakeet, a critically endangered species of bird. Well-known mammals include the kangaroo species red-necked wallaby and filander, as well as the bag-marten and the well infamous Tasmanian devil. Echidna, platypus, wombats and ring pouches can also be found here as well."}

It contains the entire Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier and the extensive nearby areas, including the former Skaftafell National Park in the southwest and the former J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rglj\u00fafur National Park in the north.\nWhat's special about the Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park lies mainly in its great variety of scenic features, which are created through a combination of rivers, glaciers, volcanism and geothermal activity.\nHistory.\nVatnaj\u00f6kull National Park was opened founded June 2008. When it was founded, the park closed an area of 12,000\u00a0km\u00b2. Since its expansion to include Lakag\u00edgar, Langisj\u00f3r and Krepputunga, the park now contains 14,200\u00a0km\u00b2, or around 14% of Iceland's land area, making it Europe's second largest national park. The only park in Europe bigger than Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park is the Jugyd Wa National Park in Russia.\nOn the 25th of June 2017 the national park was upsized by another 189\u00a0km\u00b2. The J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n and parts of the Fjalls\u00e1rl\u00f3n and Brei\u00f0amerkursandur have been placed under protection by the Environment Minister Bj\u00f6rt \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir.\nIn 2019 the park was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nGeography and geology.\nThe Vatnaj\u00f6kull has a surface area of 8,100\u00a0km\u00b2 Europe's largest glacier. The average thickness of the ice is between 400 to 800 m, at the thickest point the ice is 950 m powerful. The glacier ice covers a multitude of mountains, valleys and plateaus. It even covers some active central volcanoes, of which B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga is the largest and Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn the most active. The ice masses extend from over 2000 m above sea level up to 300\u00a0m below sea level. Nowhere else in Iceland, except on the M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull glacier, does so much precipitation fall or so much water flow into the sea as on the south side of Vatnaj\u00f6kull. In fact, so much water is currently stored in Vatnaj\u00f6kull that \u00d6lfus\u00e1, Iceland's river with the largest volume of water, would take over 200 years to transport this amount of water into the sea.\nThe landscape that surrounds the glacier is very varied. In the north, the highland plateau is crossed by glacier rivers, which swell strongly in summer. The volcanoes Askja, Kverkfj\u00f6ll and Sn\u00e6fell dominate this area, as well as the volcanic table mountain Her\u00f0ubrei\u00f0. Long ago, huge glacial floods cut the J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rglj\u00fafur gorge into the northern part of this plateau. The mighty Dettifoss waterfall still thunders into the top of this gorge, while the picturesque landscapes at Hlj\u00f3\u00f0aklettar and the horseshoe-shaped cliffs of \u00c1sbyrgi can be found further north.\nThe south side of Vatnaj\u00f6kull is known for many high mountain ridges, between which glacier tongues flow down into the valleys. The southernmost part of the glacier covers the central volcano \u00d6r\u00e6faj\u00f6kull and Iceland's highest mountain peak, Hvannadalshnj\u00fakur. Protected by the high ice masses, the Skaftafell, which is mostly grown over by plants, overlooks the black sands deposited to the west of the Skei\u00f0ar\u00e1 river. The sand consists mainly of ash, which comes from the frequent eruptions of the Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn and is transported towards the coast by so-called j\u00f6kulhlaups, glacier runs.\nTo the south of the park is Mors\u00e1rfoss, the highest waterfall in Iceland.\nThe west of Vatnaj\u00f6kull is also largely dominated by volcanic activity. Two of the world's largest fissures and lava eruptions in historical terms took place there: near Eldgj\u00e1 (934) and Lakag\u00edgar (1783\u20131784). Vonarskar\u00f0, northwest of the glacier, is a colourful, well-tempered area and is a watershed between north and south Iceland.\nClimate.\nThe weather can vary considerably in an area as large as that of the national park, especially since there is a large difference in altitude.\nPrecipitation in the lower areas south of the Vatnajokull Ice Cap varies between 1,000\u00a0mm and 3,000\u00a0mm per year. The temperatures fluctuate between 10\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0\u00b0C in summer, while winters are rather mild (the thermometer rarely falls below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C and the temperature is often well above freezing point).\nOn the mountains and the ice cap itself, annual rainfall can range from 4,000 to 5,000\u00a0mm, most of it falls as snow. The thickness of the snowpack on \u00d6r\u00e6faj\u00f6kull can vary between 10 and 15 m. Part of the snow melts while the rest of the snow forms the glacier ice. This process takes place everywhere above the snow line on the Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice cap.\nTemperatures on the southern part of the ice cap are almost always below zero and can drop to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C in winter or \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C fall. Since strong winds and storms are normal, the wind factor must be taken into account. Wind can have an essential effect on outdoor activities, even if the prevailing air temperature is otherwise relatively high. The further north you get behind the ice cap, the lower the annual rainfall. To the northeast of the ice cap, it falls to between 350 and 450\u00a0mm per year, which is the lowest rainfall in Iceland. The precipitation rises again closer to the north coast and in parts of the highlands around Askja. The temperature can drop relatively sharply on clear and windless days in winter.\nSouth winds generally lead to little or no precipitation in the north, which is associated with higher temperatures. North winds bring clouds with them, resulting in colder and wetter weather in the north of the country, while the south remains sunnier and milder. The same applies to westerly or southwest winds, which bring warmer weather to the east. The opposite is the case when the wind comes from the east: it leads to cold and precipitation in the east and better weather in the west of Iceland. This is the result of the foehn wind : moist, cold air rises near the highlands, condenses and falls as rain over the highlands, while warmer, drier air falls down into the valley on the other side. The temperature difference can be 10\u00a0\u00b0C or more.\nServices.\nVatnaj\u00f6kull National Park is divided into four areas, each of which is taken care of on their own. The northern area consists of the northwestern part of the Vatnaj\u00f6kull, the Askja Caldera and its surroundings, the J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rglj\u00fafur gorge and parts of the J\u00f6kuls\u00e1-\u00e1-Fj\u00f6llum river valley. A visitor centre and a camp site can be found in \u00c1sbyrgi and another camp site is at Vesturdalur.\nIn addition to the Kverkfj\u00f6ll Mountains and the northeastern part of Vatnaj\u00f6kull, the eastern area also includes the foothills of Sn\u00e6fells\u00f6r\u00e6fi. A visitor centre is in Skri\u00f0uklaustur.\nThe southern area extends through the southeastern part of Vatnaj\u00f6kull, or from the L\u00f3magn\u00fapur Mountains in the west to L\u00f3n and L\u00f3ns\u00f6r\u00e6fi in the east. A visitor centre and a campsite are in Skaftafell. Information centres in H\u00f6fn, Hoffell, H\u00f3lmur and Sk\u00e1lafell also cooperate with the national park administration.\nThe western area extends through the southwestern part of Vatnaj\u00f6kull and large areas outside the glacier, including the Lakag\u00edgar craters and Langisj\u00f3r. An information centre is in Kirkjub\u00e6jarklaustur and is run jointly by the national park and the local community.\nThe visitor centre in Skaftafell is open all year round. The centres in \u00c1sbyrgi and Skri\u00f0uklaustur are open from the beginning of May to September, but can also be opened in winter upon request. However, it should be noted that most parts of the national park in the highlands cannot be reached in winter.\nNational park employees carry out controls and offer courses in the highlands. The opening times of the centres vary from area to area, with the first employees driving into the highlands as soon as the main roads are clear. This happens around mid-June and they leave the area around the end of September.\nDuring the summer, employees offer short hikes with explanations on natural history. From mid-June to mid-August they conduct daily interactive hikes in \u00c0sbyrgi and Skaftafell. In the highlands, most locations offer daily hikes from the beginning of July to mid-August."}

Then, it was a margravate of the Duchy of Bavaria. Afterwards, from 1156, it became an independent duchy (later archduchy) of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (\"Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich\" 962\u20131806).\nThe House of Habsburg and House of Habsburg-Lorraine (Haus \u00d6sterreich) dominated Austria from 1273 to 1918. In 1806, when Emperor Francis I of Austria dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, Austria became the Austrian Empire. It was also part of the German Confederation until the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. In 1867, Austria formed a dual monarchy with Hungary: the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867\u20131918). Austria was reduced to the German-speaking areas of the empire (its current frontiers), after its collapse in 1918. It adopted the name The Republic of German-Austria. However, union with Germany and the chosen country name were forbidden by the Allies at the Treaty of Versailles. This led to the creation of the First Austrian Republic (1919-1933).\nFollowing the First Republic, Austrofascism tried to keep Austria independent from the German Reich. Engelbert Dollfuss accepted that most Austrians were German and Austrian, but wanted Austria to remain independent from Germany. In 1938, Adolf Hitler annexed Austria to the German Reich with the Anschluss. A large majority of the Austrian people supported it. Ten years after the Second World War, Austria again became an independent republic as the Second Austrian Republic in 1955.\nAustria joined the European Union in 1995."}

She wanted women in Britain to have the right to vote. She founded a night school in Preston. It was called St Peter's School and its aim was to educate women and girls. Later, she became an important activist. She was sent to prison seven times and committed several acts of arson (illegally setting things on fire).\nBiography.\nRigby was born on 18 October 1872 in Preston, Lancashire. She was one of seven children of Dr Alexander Clement Rayner and she was educated at Penrhos College in North Wales.\nShe married Dr Charles Rigby and lived with him in Winckley Square in Preston.\nActivism.\nIn 1907 Rigby formed the Preston branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). She was a suffragette recruiter. Rigby took part in a march to the Houses of Parliament in London with Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst in 1908. Fifty-seven women, including Rigby, were arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. During this time, Rigby took part in hunger strikes and was force-fed. Rigby planted a bomb in the Liverpool Corn Exchange on 5 July 1913. In court, it was stated that \u2018no great damage had been done by the explosion\u2019. Mrs Rigby was sent to prison for nine months with hard labour.\nRigby had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU.\nShe said she set fire to the bungalow of Sir William Lever, Bt \n(later Lord Leverhulme) on 7 July 1913. The property, near Rivington Pike on the West Pennine Moors, had a lot of valuable paintings and the attack resulted in damage costing \u00a320,000.\nAfter she said:\nRigby disagreed with the WSPU's decision not to campaign on suffrage issues during World War I. She joined the Independent Women's Social and Political Union split, forming a branch in Preston.\nLater life.\nAccording to Elizabeth Ashworth in \"Champion Lancastrians\", in 1888, Rigby was the first woman in Preston to own a bicycle. During World War I, she bought a cottage near Preston named Marigold Cottage and used it to produce food for the war effort.\nIn 1926, Charles Rigby retired and the couple built a new house. It was called Erdmuth and it was located outside Llanrhos, North Wales. Charles died before it was finished, however, and Edith moved there alone at the end of 1926. She eventually suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in 1950 at Erdmuth."}

It wants Afghanistan to have a government that is chosen by the Afghan people, a democracy. RAWA also wants that government to not be based on a religious belief or to allow religious people to have too much power. In English, this kind of government is called a secular state. The group is against violence.\nMeena Keshwar Kamal, an Afghan student activist founded RAWA in 1977. In February 1987, Kamal was killed for her political work. The group was started in Kabul, but it moved to Pakistan in the early 1980s. \nThe group wants women to be part of both political and social activities. That way, they should get human rights. They should also continue to work against the government of Afghanistan, because it is not democratic or secular enough. In the last years, many Afghan governments were fundamentalist. According to RAWA, women should be part of a democratic and secular Afghan government. Afghanistan has seen many civil wars. RAWA wants to disarm the different groups. The group has opposed all Afghan governments, since 1977: the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996-2001), the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2001-2021), and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (from 2021).\nBackground.\nThe RAWA was started in Kabul in 1977 as an independent social and political organization of Afghan women fighting for human rights and social justice. The organization then moved parts of its work out of Afghanistan into Pakistan. For many years, it has been working for Afghan women from Pakistan. A group of Afghan women led by Meena Keshwar Kamal founded RAWA in 1977. At age 21, she worked on educating women. This was the founding idea for RAWA. In 1979, Kamal began a campaign against the Soviet occupation and the Soviet-supported government of Afghanistan. In 1981, she launched a bilingual magazine \"Payam-e-Zan\" (\"Women's Message\").That year, she visited France for the French Socialist Party Congress. She also established schools for Afghan refugee children, hospitals and handicraft centers for refugee women in Pakistan. Because of her activities and views, as well as her work against the government and religious fundamentalists, she was assassinated on February 4, 1987.\nActivities.\nIn the 1990s, RAWA held many seminars and press conferences, and did some fundraising in Pakistan. RAWA also created secret schools and orphanages for women and girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They secretly filmed how the religious police beat women, and executed some of them. Both the Taliban and the Northern Alliance outlawed RAWA activities, but RAWA continued. RAWA was even able to show what they did in publications like \"Payam-e-Zan\".\nIn 2001 NATO removed the Taliban government from power, and started occupation. RAWA is very critical about this, because there were many civilian casualties. The group even threatened to sue the US government, because it had used four photos of the RAWA website without permission. These photos were used in propaganda material that was later dropped on cities in Afghanistan, during the 2001 invasion.\nRAWA warned that the Afghan forces that fought alongside NATO troops were just as fundamentalist and dangerous as the Taliban. The government led by President Hamid Karzai didn't have any support in most parts of Afghanistan. According to RAWA, fundamentalists were enforcing laws against women in much the same way the Taliban had done. Media reports about the Herat government of Ismail Khan also support these claims. Khan was the person who created a Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. Reports by Human Rights Watch also support these claims. One report released by Human Rights Watch in 2012 describes a situation where women are punished by the law for attempting to escape from domestic abuse and also occasionally for being victims of rape. According to the report, Karzai was unwilling or unable to have a unchanging opion against conservative forces. According to the report, it was shocking to see that after ten years, the situation of women in Afghanistan hadn't changed much. \nRAWA still does much of the same things it did in the 1980s: Collect money to support hospitals, schools and orphanages. They still run many projects in Afghanistan an Pakistan. Since 2006, RAWA has held an event on International Women's Day. \nIn 2006, a member of RAWA was invited to a televised discussion on a local Afghan TV channel, TOLO TV. In that discussion, she talked with a representative of a hard line Islamic fundamentalist group. She named the leaders of the different Islamist groups. During the discussion, she called these leaders war criminals and said they were responsible for \"the ongoing tragedy in Afghanistan\". TOLO TV edited the discussion, and removed the audio of the parts that contained the names of the people she gave.\nOn October 7, 2006, the Afghan Women's Mission (AWM) organized a fund raising event for RAWA in Los Angeles, California. Eve Ensler was the chief guest and radio host. Sonali Kolhatkar and Zoya, a member of RAWA, were among the speakers. \"Zoya\" is a pseudonym for an active member of RAWA's Foreign Committee who has traveled to many countries, including the United States, Spain and Germany. In 2003, she published her biography \"Zoya\u2019s Story - An Afghan Woman's Battle for Freedom\". In June 2008, Zoya testified to the Human Rights Commission of the German Parliament (Bundestag) to persuade the German government to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.\nIn 2009, RAWA and other women's rights groups strongly condemned a \"Shia Family Code\". They say it legalized rape in a marriage within Northern Afghan Shia Muslim communities. It also supports child marriage, and purdah (seclusion) for married women. President Hamid Karzai passed this law to get more support for his coalition government from hardliners in these communities. With this law he also got support from Iran. This code also discriminates against women when they want to inherit, or get a divorce. \nIn February 2012, the group commemorated the 25th anniversary of the death of RAWA founder Meena Keshwar Kamal with a gathering of women in Kabul. In August 2012, a RAWA representative was a keynote speaker at the annual convention of Veterans For Peace at the University of Maryland in College Park.\nRecognition.\nRAWA has so far won 16 awards and certificates from around the world for its work for human rights and democracy. They include the sixth Asian Human Rights Award - 2001, the French Republic's Liberty, Equality, Fraternity Human Rights Prize, 2000, Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize 2001,Glamour Women of the Year 2001, 2001 SAIS-Novartis International Journalism Award from Johns Hopkins University, Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition from the U.S. Congress, 2004, Honorary Doctorate from University of Antwerp (Belgium) for outstanding non-academic achievements, and other awards.\nWhat others say about RAWA.\nIn the book \"With All Our Strength: The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan\"\nby Anne Brodsky, a number of world-known writers and human rights activists share their views of RAWA. They include Arundhati Roy who says \"Each of us needs a little RAWA\"; Eve Ensler, author of \"The Vagina Monologues\", who suggests that RAWA must stand as a model for every group working to end violence; Katha Pollitt, author of \"Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture\"; Ahmed Rashid, author of \"Taliban\" and \"Jihad\"; and Asma Jahangir, Special Rapporteur of the United Nations and prominent women's rights activist of Pakistan are two Pakistanis who write about RAWA and express their support."}

The area was occupied by the Iberians and Greeks established several colonies on the coast before the Roman conquest. It was the first area of Hispania conquered by the Romans. It then came under Visigothic rule after the collapse of the western part of the Roman Empire. In 718, the Umayyad Caliphate occupied the area and became a part of Muslim ruled al-Andalus. The Frankish Empire conquered the area from the Muslims. It created a buffer zone of Christian counties against Islamic rule known as the Marca Hispanica. In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became progressively independent from Frankish rule.\nIn 1137, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona accepted King Ramiro II of Aragon's proposal to marry Queen Petronila. Thus they united the dinasties of the County of Barcelona with the Kingdom of Aragon and they created the Crown of Aragon. Meanwhile, the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties adopted a common polity known as Principality of Catalonia. Catalonia contributed to the expansion of the Crown's trade and military, most significantly their navy. The crisis of the 14th century, the end of the reign of House of Barcelona and a civil war (1462\u20131472) weakened the role of the Principality in Crown and international affairs.\nThe marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 created a dynastic union between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile. However, both kingdoms kept their own laws, institutions, borders and currency. In 1492 the Spanish colonization of the Americas began, political power began to shift away towards Castile. The economic crisis, the peasants' revolt and tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy caused the Reapers' War (1640\u20131652). The Principality of Catalonia maintained its political status, but it lost it after the War of Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714). Following Catalan surrender on 11 September 1714, the king Philip V of Bourbon, inspired by the model of France, imposed a unifying administration across Spain. He suppressed the Crown of Aragon and enacted the Nueva Planta decrees, banning the main Catalan political institutions and rights. These led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature. Catalonia experienced economic growth. This was reinforced in the late 18th century when C\u00e1diz's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.\nIn the 19th century Catalonia was very affected by the Napoleonic and Carlist Wars. The Napoleonic occupation and subsequent war in Spain began a period of political and economic turmoil. In the second third of the century, Catalonia became a center of industrialization. Thanks to its wealth from the industrial expansion, Catalonia experienced a cultural renaissance. This happened at the same time as nationalism and several workers movements (particularly anarchism) appeared.\nIn the 20th century, Catalonia enjoyed and lost varying degrees of autonomy. The Second Spanish Republic established Catalan self-governance and the official use of the Catalan language. The Republican defeat established the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. During this time, the autonomy was suppressed. Between 1959 and 1974 Spain experienced an economic expansion known as the Spanish Miracle. Catalonia prospered as Spain's most important industrial and tourist area. In 1975 Franco died, bringing his regime to an end. The new democratic Spanish constitution of 1978 recognised Catalonia's autonomy and language. It regained considerable self-government. In the 2010s there have been growing calls for Catalan independence."}

It wants to help women in Afghanistan. It is independent of the government. It is the largest non-government Afghan women's rights organization in the world. It is dedicated to protecting the rights of Afghan women and girls. The staff are mostly Afghans. WAW adopts a community-based approach. For example, they give workshops about women's rights according to Islamic law. WAW opened what it called family guidance centers: there, women can ask for help, if they have problems at home. They also get counseling, for example, if the women are the victims of domestic violence. If there is a danger to the health or the life of the woman, the woman is sent to a women's shelter. In the shelters, women can talk to layers who help them fight for their rights. They can also get teaching in different skills. When these services are not enough, WAW also helps the women get a divorce. As well as the women, their children can also get a basic education in these centers. \nWomen in Afghanistan have built houses for women as shelters in most of the provinces in Afghanistan such as in Kabul, Kapisa, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kunduz, Faryab, and Saripul. The vision of the organization is to help the women get independent, WAW wants the women to participate in different areas of society: in politics, cultural reforms and social development. \nAccording to WAW, there are many rules and norms which stand in the way of the women getting more freedoms. To achieve their goals, the organisation also relies on religion, and the social context these women are in. It wants to establish a shelter for women in every province in the country. Accorording to WAW, the Taliban have become more violent, because there were freign troops in Afghanistan. WAW also teaches its members how to read and write. Children enter the organization's kindergarten to learn reading, writing, doing art, sing songs, and playing games. Women for Afghan Women uses the Bill of Afghan women in order to implement women's right and meet the needs of woman in Afghanistan. The Bill of Rights was signed by the president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai and it was handed to all women who participated the third yearly conference of the organization.\nWhen it comes to freedom, Afghan girls and women are in a bad position: In 2012, Afghanistan was nominated the most dangerous country that a girl can be born in. Many women are poor, and getting health care is difficullt for them. This is mainly caused by decades of civil war. Because there was no economy that worked well, this made it difficult for women to live there. When a woman with children is sentenced to go to prison, she usually takes her children to prison as well. WAW's Children's Support Center (CSC) raises money to get children out of prison. WAW has a program that helps uneducated children meet the criteria to enter a local school. Afghan women are usually afraid to speak about the mistreatment that they face every day in their lives. WAW's biggest projects is to give these women a voice, and to build the self-esteem of Afghan women who are used to burying their emotions and their opinions. Ten percent of the Afghan women receive this aid, and can express their opinions in front of millions of people.\nWAW also operate halfway houses, for women who have just left prison, and have nowhere else to go. In these halfway houses, WAW also helps these women find a new job, and a place to live. "}

It stars the voices of Abbi Jacobson, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Eric Andr\u00e9, Olivia Colman, Fred Armisen, Beck Bennett, John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Blake Griffin, and Conan O'Brien.\nPlot.\nKatie Mitchell is a quirky aspiring filmmaker in Kentwood, Michigan, who often clashes with her nature-obsessed and technophobic father Rick, and has recently been accepted into film school in California. The evening before Katie leaves, Rick accidentally breaks her laptop after a fight over one of Katie's previous short films, leading the family to fear their relationship will forever be strained. To try to prevent this, Rick decides to cancel Katie's flight and instead take her, her mother Linda, younger brother Aaron, and family dog Monchi on a cross-country road trip to her college as one last bonding experience.\nMeanwhile, technology entrepreneur Mark Bowman declares his highly intelligent AI PAL obsolete as he unveils a new line of home robots to replace her. In revenge, PAL orders all the robots to capture humans worldwide and launch them into space. The Mitchells manage to avoid capture at a roadstop caf\u00e9 in Kansas. Rick decides that his family should stay put in the caf\u00e9 for their own safety, but Katie convinces him to help save the world instead. They meet two defective robots, Eric and Deborahbot 5000, who tell the family they can use a kill code to shut down PAL and all the robots.\nThe Mitchells make it to a mall in eastern Colorado to upload the kill code, but PAL chip-enabled appliances attempt to stop them. Katie tries to upload the kill code, but is stopped when a giant Furby pursues the family. They ultimately trap and defeat the Furby, destroying a PAL router in the process, which disables the hostile devices but stops the kill code from uploading. On the way to Silicon Valley to upload the kill code directly to PAL, Linda reveals to Katie that she and Rick had originally lived in a cabin in the mountains years ago as it was his lifelong dream before he gave up on it.\nUpon arriving in Silicon Valley, the Mitchells disguise themselves as robots and head to PAL Labs HQ to shut it down, but PAL manipulates them by revealing surveillance footage from the caf\u00e9 of Katie telling Aaron in secret that she was pretending to have faith in Rick so that he would take them to upload the kill code. As a heartbroken Rick sees this, the Mitchells fail to reach PAL's lair and Rick and Linda are captured by PAL's stronger and smarter robots. PAL then reprograms Eric and Deborahbot to obey her, while Katie, Aaron, and Monchi escape.\nKatie discovers Rick's recordings of her childhood on her camera, realizing that Rick gave up on his lifelong dream to give his daughter a normal life. In the meantime, Rick reflects on his actions after seeing one of Katie's videos that mirrors his relationship with Katie. Reinvigorated, Katie and Aaron infiltrate PAL Labs HQ again, this time using Monchi to malfunction the robots, as his appearance causes an error in their programming. With help from Mark, Rick and Linda free themselves and plan to upload Katie's home movie of Monchi to short-circuit the robots. However, Rick is outnumbered by the robots when he is about to upload the video, while Katie and Aaron are captured.\nFacing PAL to justify saving humanity, Katie explains that no matter how hard her family struggles, they will always stay connected despite how different they are. PAL rejects this reasoning and drops Katie from her lair. Eric and Deborahbot, having been inspired by Rick's \"reprogramming\" himself that allowed him to use a computer, revert to their malfunctioning states and upload Katie's home movie, saving her and helping the rest of the Mitchells. The family bands together to fight the rest of the robots. Katie eventually destroys PAL by dropping her into a glass of water, freeing all the humans and disabling the remaining robots.\nA few months after the uprising, Katie and her family arrive at her college as she shares one last goodbye with them. She later joins them on another road trip with Eric and Deborahbot to Washington, D.C. to accept the Congressional Gold Medal."}

They \"cause changes in the behaviour of one of their hosts\". This has the effect of improving their chances of reproduction. \nThey make the first host more likely to be eaten by a predator. Then the parasite reproduces sexually in the predator. Examples can be found in bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and animals. \nParasites may also change the host behaviour to increase the protection to the parasites or their offspring. The term \"bodyguard manipulation\" may be used for such mechanisms.\nExample: a parasitic worm is eaten by an amphipod. The worm changes the behaviour of the host amphipod. The changes make it more likely that the amphipod is eaten by fish, where it reproduces. The induced behavioral change in the host thus leads to the parasite's increased success in completing its life cycle."}
