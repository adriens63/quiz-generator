It is used in popular protocols like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (to protect Internet traffic) and WEP (to secure wireless networks).\nRC4 is known for being simple and quick, but attacks are likely to happen when the start of the output keystream is not removed, or one keystream is used twice; some ways of using RC4 can turn into very insecure cryptosystems such as WEP.\nRC4 was created by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. While its official name is \"Rivest Cipher 4\", the RC abbreviation is also known to stand for \"Ron's Code\" (see also RC2, RC5 and RC6).\nRC4 was first created as a trade secret, but in September 1994 a description of it was posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list. It was soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup, and from there to many websites on the Internet. The code was confirmed to be genuine(not fake) as its output matched that of proprietary software using licensed RC4. Because the algorithm is known, it is no longer a trade secret. The name \"RC4\" is trademarked, however. RC4 is often referred to as \"ARCFOUR\" or \"ARC4\" (meaning Alleged RC4, because RSA has never officially released the algorithm), to avoid possible trademark problems. It has become part of some commonly used encryption protocols and standards, including WEP and WPA for wireless cards and TLS.\nThe two main reasons which helped its use over such a big range of applications are its speed and simplicity. Uses of RC4 in both software and hardware are extremely easy to develop.\nThe RC4 encryption algorithm is started with a different key length, usually between 40 and 256 bits, using the \"key-scheduling\" algorithm (KSA). Once this has been completed, the stream of encrypted bits is created using the \"pseudo-random generation algorithm\" (PRGA).\nRC4 fails the standards set by cryptographers for a secure cipher in many ways, and is not recommended for use in new applications as there are a lot of methods of attacking RC4. Dropping the first kilobyte of data from the keystream can improve the security somewhat.\nRC4-based cryptosystems.\nWhere a cryptosystem is marked with \"(optionally)\", RC4 is one of several ciphers the system can be set to use.\nOther websites.\n\"RC4\"\n\"RC4 in WEP\""}

Blowfish has a good encryption rate in software and until 2008 no cryptanalytic attack model of it has been found. However, the AES block cipher algorithm now has more attention.\nSchneier made Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, to be used as a replacement for the old DES algorithm and to remove the problems and difficulties of other encryption algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other algorithms were proprietary, or were secrets. Schneier has said that, \"Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.\"\nMain features of the design include key-dependent S-boxes and a very complex key schedule. Blowfish is one of the fastest block ciphers used by many people, except when changing keys. Each new key needs to be pre-processed which takes the same time as encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This stops its use in certain applications (such as in the smallest embedded systems like the early smartcards), but it is not a problem in other applications. In one of the applications, it is actually good: the password-hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm that comes from Blowfish which makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks. \"See\" key strengthening.\nBlowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length from 0 up to 448 bits\nIt is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent S-boxes. It is similar in structure to CAST-128, which uses fixed S-boxes.\nIn 1996, Serge Vaudenay found a known-plaintext attack needing 28\"r\" + 1 known plaintexts to break, where \"r\" is the number of rounds. Moreover, he also found a class of weak keys that can be detected and broken by the same attack with only 24\"r\" + 1 known plaintexts. This attack cannot be used against the regular Blowfish; it assumes knowledge of the key-dependent S-boxes. Vincent Rijmen, in his Ph.D. papers, introduced a second-order differential attack that can break four rounds and no more. Still there is no known way to break the full 16 rounds, apart from a brute-force search.\nA sign extension bug in one of the published C code has been found in 1996.\nThere is no good cryptanalysis on the full-round version of Blowfish known publicly till 2008. However, in 2007, Bruce Schneier noted that while Blowfish is still in use, he recommended using the new Twofish algorithm instead "}

He was only 35 when he won a record majority of seats in the 1911 elections, making him the youngest premier of Western Australia.\nHis parents were from Cornwall and had moved to Moonta to work in the large copper mines. They later moved to Eaglehawk, near Bendigo where Scaddan worked in the gold mines and studied to be an engine driver. In 1896 he moved to the Western Australian goldfields. He was elected to parliament in 1904 where he became famous for his long speeches, some going for me than three hours. He became premier when the Labor Party won the 1911 election. He believed that the government should own and control businesses and he set up state owned shipping lines, brickworks, sawmills, trams, abattoirs, fishing, quarries and even a hotel. While many of these were well run, many were not, and a costly failure at the Wyndham freezing works led to a loss of support. At the next election he only won by two seats. When one ALP member disappeared, and another resigned in 1916, the Country Party were able to form a new government with help from the Liberal Party.\nWhen the Labor Party split on conscription, Scaddan who supported it, joined the new National Labor Party. He later joined the Country Party. He was elected in and out of parliament over the next 15 years. He felt Western Australia was not treated fairly by the government of Australia, and was on a committee which looked at how Western Australia could become an independent country.

The game features single-player and multiplayer game play and contains an in-game level editor, its main feature. The game engine is free and open source software, under the Zlib License, with commercial support available from the developer's own business counterpart, Dot3 Labs.\nThe game started as a redesign to the original Cube Engine, and its first release was made on May 6, 2004. The game gets updated quite regularly.\nTechnology.\n\"Sauerbraten\" was made out of the game Cube, but is much more advanced and a player can create new levels. \"Sauerbraten\" was not made to look very good, but to allow easy map making within the game without making a big download. \"Sauerbraten CTF Edition\" is less than 350 megabytes. The game \"Crysis\" is around 3,000 megabytes.\nMap editing.\nMaps are made out of cubes, which can be made longer or shorter and can be reshaped. These cubes can be mapped out easily, using the in-game editor. This means that both map-makers and players can make very big, detailed maps very quickly. This is not like other games such as \"Quake\", where you need a lot of effort and bugfixing work to even get the map to work.\nThis simplicity in editing has resulted in a lot of maps released by players and developers. They are available on the \"Quadropolis\" forums.\nGameplay.\nThe game has singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer can be with LAN and Internet connection. Online game types are deathmatch, last man standing,\"Capture\" (where teams fight for control of parts on the map), Quake-style Capture the Flag, also instant-shot games (Instagib, Insta-clan-arena, insta-capture) as well as online multiplayer map editing, which is one of \"Sauerbraten\"'s most interesting and popular features. In single player modes the computer controls monsters against you.\nMedia.\nThe game has been shown in a Burger King television commercial, it received four out of five stars in a MacWorld UK review, and the game was mentioned in Issue 3 of (as well as their 101 Free Games Article), where it was described as being \"perfect for both stingy and creative gamers alike\".\nThe CTF edition was given a long review by Phoronix, a website focused on Linux and software reviews, as well as Linux.com, a website providing news related to free and open source software."}

The crier can also be used in court or official announcements. Criers often dress elaborately, a tradition known from the 18th century, in a red and gold robe, white breeches, black boots and a tricorne hat.\nThey carry a handbell to make a loud noise and they shout the words \"Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!\" before making their announcements. The word \"Oyez\" means \"hear ye,\" which is a call for silence and attention. \"Oyez\" is from an Anglo-Norman word for \"listen\". Some town criers announcements are recorded in books called a Proclamation Book The proclamations book in Chester from the early 19th century records the town criers call as \"O Yes, O Yes!\"\nHistory.\nEngland.\nIn Medieval England, town criers were the most important way of spreading news with the people of a town. Many could not read newspapers. Royal proclamations, local bylaws, market days, advertisements and even selling loaves of sugar were all proclaimed by a bellman or town crier for centuries. During Christmas 1798, the Chester Canal Company sold some sugar that was damaged in their packet boat and this was advertised by the town crier.\nChester's first 'belman' was in 1540. His was paid one (old) penny for 'going for anything that is lost' and 4 old pennies for leading a funeral procession. In 1681, a fire safety law that all houses should have tiled roofs, not thatched, was to 'be published throughout the city by the day bellman. In 1553, the crier was paid 13 old pennies for 'ridunge the banes' (reading the banns or adverts) for the Chester Mystery Plays. In 1598, bellman Richard Woodcock must have been dressed in a similar way to the London bellman, for he had 'a tymber mast typt at both endes and embellished in the middest with silver' (a wooden stick with silver decorations).\nIn 1620, there was a fight at the crossroads between the butchers and the bakers where the 'Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them'(broke his silver stick among them). In 1607, one public notice read by George Tunnall, the bellman, that putting rubbish in the river was illegal.\nIn 1656 the parish register of St Mary le Crypt in Gloucester records banns of marriage as being \"published by the Bellman\".\nIn 1715, a local man recorded that the 'Belman at the Cross ... Reads publicly a proclamation in the Mayor's name, commanding all persons in the City to bee of peaceable and civil behaviour, not to walk around the Streets or Rows at unreasonable hours of night'. In 1743, John Posnitt took over as 'Day and Night Bellman'.\nIn 1792, Chester had a day-time and night-time bellman, John Yarwood and a crier, William Ratcliffe, but by 1835 there seems to have been only one position. It was not until 1998 that Chester had both a crier and a bellman again.\nTown criers were protected by royalty, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases. To this day, any town crier in the British Commonwealth is protected under old English law that they are \"not to be hindered or heckled while performing their duties\". To injure or harm a town crier was seen as an act of treason against the ruling monarchy. The term \"Posting A Notice\" comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn.\nEurope.\nThe same as England, town criers were the most important way to deliver news to the people of the town because many people could not read newspapers or write. Proclamations, local bylaws, market days, adverts, were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier.\nCriers were not always men, many town criers were women. Bells were not the only way to make noise - in Holland, a gong was often used, and in France a drum was used, or a hunting horn.\nModern town criers.\nThe best dressed town crier and escort at the last World Championships (date of entry 2008) are Peter and Maureen Taunton from the county town of Stafford, UK. They also hold the title of the best dressed town crier in Britain 2008 Competition held at Alnwick for the Loyal Company of Town Criers. They are also the Best Dressed Crier at the National Town Crier Competition in Hastings 2007.\nPeter Moore has been The London Town Crier for more than 30 years. He is Town Crier for The Mayor of London, The City of Westminster, and London Boroughs. He is also Freeman and Liveryman of The City of London.\nAlan Myatt holds the world record as the loudest town cryer at 112.8 decibels.\nThe need for town criers has disappeared and they became part of the local folklore. There are European and World Championship competitions for modern town criers."}

It also may have contributed to the success of the Muslim conquests.\nIts social and cultural impact is comparable to that of the Black Death.\nOrigin and impact.\nThe plague may have come from Ethiopia or Egypt, and it was eventually carried north to the large city of Constantinople. Ships carrying grain, which the city imported, had many rats that carried the plague.\nAt its height, the plague killed 10,000 people in Constantinople everyday. It eventually killed 40% of the city's population. In all, about 25 million people died because of the plague. It is said to have contributed to the fall of the Byzantine Empire, because it killed farmers and caused famine. The empire relied on tax money, and the plague killed many taxpayers."}

It brings the Swallows and the Amazons together and introduces a new group of characters, the Eels and the Mastodon. Ransome sailed to Hamford Water, an area of salt marshes and low lying islands in his boat \"Nancy Blackett\". He set the book in this tidal place which offered a new setting for his characters and chances to explore and map the area.\nPlot summary.\nThe Swallows mean to sail in the \"Goblin\" to Hamford Water and camp with their father, but he is called away on naval business. Instead he maroons them with a small boat (dinghy) on an island. Before he leaves, Father gives them a basic map of the area they call Secret Water and suggests they map the area before he returns to pick them up.\nFor a surprise, he has arranged for the Amazons to come down from the Lake District and join them with another dinghy.\nThey see some mysterious footprints which turn out to belong to the Mastodon, a local boy. He mistakes them for the Eels, another family who camp in the area regularly. Later the Eels arrive and are initially hostile before they settle down for a friendly war.\nIt seems that due to the distractions of war and being cut off by the tides, the chart will not be completed. However early in the last morning two separate groups of children complete it."}

They work to make the cryptographic system very difficult for computers to break using brute force attack. For that reason, one of the definitions of \"breaking\" a cryptographic scheme is to find a method faster than a brute force attack.\nThe selection of an appropriate key length depends on how difficult it will be to break it using a brute force attack. By obfuscating the data before encryption, brute force attacks are less effective and more difficult to determine.\nThe brute force attack can be used together with a dictionary attack.\nFor symmetric encryption, a key size of 128 bits is considered secure against brute force by traditional computers. 192 or 256 bits is considered secure against quantum computers. Many old ciphers, such as DES, used short keys which made them breakable by brute force."}

Information theory measures the amount of information in data that could have more than one value.

Data compression and data communication are statistical, because they guess unknown values. The amount of information in data measures how easily it is guessed by a person who does not know its value. \nA key measure in information theory is \"entropy\". Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a dice (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy."}

He was a major figure in modern art and painted some of the first modern abstract works. His art changed several times during his life. It was fauvist, abstract, expressionist and constructivist in turn.\nLife.\nBorn in Moscow, Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa. He enrolled at the University of Moscow and chose to study law and economics. Quite successful in his profession\u2014he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of Dorpat\u2014he started painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30.\nIn 1896 he settled in Munich and studied first in a private school, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He went back to Moscow in 1914 after World War I started. He was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Moscow and returned to Germany in 1921. There he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France where he lived the rest of his life, and became a French citizen in 1939. He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944.\nInfluences.\nLater in life he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the Vologda region north of Moscow. In \"Looks on the Past\", he tells how the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that, on entering them, he felt he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), can be seen in much of his early work.\nHe was interested in geometry in art and philosophy. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares."}

He established a new unified political polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the following Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from northwest India, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees. \nThe Arab conquests brought about the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and a great territorial loss for the Byzantine Empire. Though spectacular, the Arab successes are not hard to understand in hindsight. The Sassanid Persian and Byzantine empires were militarily exhausted from decades of fighting one another. This prevented them from dealing effectively with the mobile Arab raiders operating from the desert. Moreover, many of the peoples living under the rule of these empires, for example Jews and Christians in Persia and Monophysites in Syria, were disloyal and sometimes even welcomed the Arab invaders, largely because of religious conflict in both empires.\nHistory.\nSome of the individual conquests are mentioned here:\nByzantine-Arab Wars: 634-750.\nThe Byzantine-Arab Wars were between the Byzantine Empire and at first the Rashidun and then the Umayyad caliphates.\nUnder the Rashidun there were the conquests of Syria (637), Armenia (639), Egypt (639) and North Africa (652). Under the Umayyads the continuing conquest of North Africa (665), the second Arab siege of Constantinople (717-718) and the conquest of Tbilisi (736). In 827 there followed the conquest of southern Italy (827).\nConquests in Asia: 633 - 712.\nThe last ruler of the Sassanid Empire in Persia was defeated by the Rashidun in 633 and 636, but the final military victory didn't come until 642 when the Persian army was destroyed. \nDuring the seventh century the Umayyad fought successfully against the early Rajput in north India and in Central Asia. \nIn 711, a Muslim expedition defeated Raja Dahir at what is now Hyderabad in Sindh and established Umayyad rule by 712. The Umayyad brought under control the whole of what is modern Pakistan, from Karachi to Kashmir and reached the borders of Kashmir within three years. But rather soon afterwards semi-independent Arab ruled states developed.\nConquest of Hispania: 711-718.\nThe conquest of the Iberian Peninsula began when the Moors (mostly Berbers with some Arabs) invaded Visigothic Christian Iberia (modern Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Andorra) in the year 711. They landed at Gibraltar on April 30 and worked their way northward. This territory, under the Arab name \"Al-Andalus\", became first an Emirate and then an independent Umayyad Caliphate after the overthrowing of the dynasty in Damascus by the Abbasids. In 1031 the Christian kingdoms started the Reconquest up to 1492, when Granada, the last kingdom of Al-\u00c1ndalus fell under the Spanish Kings.\nFurther conquests: 1200-1800.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, the Sahelian kingdom expanded Muslim territories far from the coast. Muslim traders spread Islam.\nThe modern era saw the rise of three powerful Muslim empires: the Ottoman Empire of the Middle East and Europe, the Safavid Empire of Persia and Central Asia, and the Mughal Empire of India; along with their contest and fall to the rise of the colonial powers of Europe.\nDecline and collapse: 1800-1924.\nThe Mughal Empire declined in 1707 after the death of Aurangzeb and was officially abolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Another needed attribute is that the key space designed to be \"flat\", having no or very few weak keys.\nExamples.\nThe block cipher Rijndael/AES uses a key of up to 256 bits, resulting in a key space containing about 2256 which is over 1.1579 \u00d7 1077 keys.

{"id": "136902", "revid": "664627", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136902", "title": "Unitarianism", "text": "Unitarianism is a term that describes some forms of Christianity. Unitarianism can be described as the belief that God is just one person. This is different from what most other Christians think, which is that God is three different people all in the same person. That belief is called Trinitarianism. Unitarian Christians believe in Jesus of Nazareth. They think that Jesus was a great leader and prophet, but they generally do not think that Jesus is part of God himself.\nTwo main forms.\nJesus existed before his human life.\nThe \"Son of God\" is a being that existed before Jesus' human life. It is called the Logos who dwelt with God in the beginning and then was born as the man Jesus. However, he is not eternal, but had a beginning of existence. God created him. This theology is commonly called Arianism, but there are many varieties of this form of Unitarianism. They range from the belief that the Son, before he came to earth, was a divine spirit of the same nature as God to the belief that he was an angel or other lesser spirit creature of a wholly different nature from God. Arius' views are only one variation of this theology.\nWhatever the case, in this belief system, Jesus is beneath God, but higher than humans (and has always been so). This concept could be referred to as \"elevated subordinationism.\" It is associated with early church figures such as Justin Martyr, Lucian of Antioch, Eusebius of Caesarea, Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Asterius the Sophist, Eunomius, and Ulfilas, as well as Felix, Bishop of Urgel and others who believed that Jesus was God in his divine nature but his divinity in his human nature was through adoption. Arian forms of Unitarianism remain among Unitarians in Transylvania, Hungary, France, and several countries in Africa. Famous Arian Unitarians include Isaac Newton, Andrews Norton and Dr. William Ellery Channing.Ralph Waldo Emerson's father was a Unitarian pastor.\nSince the 19th century, several Evangelical or Revivalist movements also used an elevated subordinationist theology. This can be best described as Nontrinitarianism, rather than Unitarianism. Important figures include Barton W. Stone and Charles Taze Russell. Theologies among Evangelical Unitarians are sometimes classed as Arian, and sometimes Sabellian (Jesus is God in the flesh, the manifestation of God, who exists as a single person) and the Chinese-based sabbatarian True Jesus Church. Other modern non-trinitarian churches, such as the Filipino-based Iglesia ni Cristo, may also be included, although they reject the \"unitarian\" name to avoid confusion. Jehovah's Witnesses also have a nontrinitarian theology with specific traits. The Christian Churches of God (CCG) is another Unitarian Church with a World Conference. It has a lot of material on Unitarian theology and history and holds the doctrine of the Pre-existence of Jesus Christ. CCG like other Sabbatarian Churches of God trace their ancestry back to the early church and follow biblical law. The CCG and Sabbatarians are sometimes erroneously called Arians due to the pejorative Trinitarian use of that term and also that of Subordinationists (see Bibliography).\nJesus did not exist before his human life.\nThis theology ranges from the belief that Jesus was merely a great man filled with the Holy Spirit (sometimes called Psilanthropism or, more commonly, Socinianism) to the belief that he is the incarnation of God's \"impersonal\" Logos. It is associated with early church figures like the Ebionites, Theodotus of Byzantium, Artemon, and Paul of Samosata in the early Church, Marcellus of Ancyra and his pupil Photinus in the 4th century AD, and Michael Servetus, Ferenc D\u00e1vid and Faustus Socinus in the Protestant Reformation. It is from the latter that we get the word \"Socinianism,\" but the teaching of Socinus is unique in more than just its Christology, and so the name is best not used as merely a Christological term.\nIn modern times we see the psilanthropist view manifested in Rationalist Unitarianism, which emerged from the German Rationalism and the liberal theology of the 19th century. Its proponents took a highly intellectual and humanistic approach to religion. They rejected most of the miraculous events in the Bible (including the virgin birth.) They embraced evolutionary concepts, stated that man was good by default and abandoned the doctrine of biblical infallibility. Rationalist Unitarianism is distinguished from Deism (with which it nevertheless shares many features) by its belief in a personal deity who directly acts on creation, while Deists see God as holding aloof from creation.\nNotable Rationalist Unitarians include Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker in theology and ministry, Joseph Priestley and Linus Pauling in science, Susan B. Anthony and Florence Nightingale in humanitarianism and social justice, Charles Dickens in literature, and Frank Lloyd Wright in arts. Many Hungarian Unitarians embrace the principles of Rationalist Unitarianism\u2014the only Unitarian high school in the world, John Sigismund Unitarian Academy in Cluj Napoca (Kolozsv\u00e1r, Klausenburg), Romania, teaches Rationalist Unitarianism. The psilanthropist concept of the nature of Jesus is similar to the viewpoint held by the Islamic faith, which regards Jesus as a non-divine and human Prophet. The Christadelphians, the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith and the Biblical Unitarians are Evangelical Unitarians."}

The benefits provided include disability compensation, pension, education, home loans, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, survivors\u2019 benefits, medical benefits and burial benefits.\nIt is administered by the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\nHistory.\nThe beginning of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs dates back to 1636 when the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony voted that the Colony would support soldiers disabled by its war with the Native American tribe called the Pequot. During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress of 1776 enacted pensions for disabled soldiers. Then, in the 19th century, support was extended to widows and dependents of veterans. Veterans' benefits expanded further during World War I, with the first consolidation of World War I veterans' programs occurring in 1921 when Congress created the Veterans Bureau. With increased benefits and agencies disbursing the benefits, the Veterans Administration was established in 1930, bringing all the agencies together. Frank T. Hines was the first administrator of veterans affairs, leading the organisation until 1945. The GI Bill was passed in 1944 as the first educational assistance to military personnel.\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs was officially established as a Cabinet-level department on March 15, 1989, by President George H.W.

Accelerators work by pushing particles like electrons, protons, or atomic nuclei (the centers of atoms) with electric fields and by steering them with magnetic fields. Their main use is to study particle physics.\nThe largest accelerators are used to study particles smaller than atoms; smaller accelerators are used to study atomic nuclei and make radioactive materials. There are two kinds of particle accelerators: linear accelerators and circular accelerators. Linear accelerators move the particles in a line, while circular accelerators move the particles in a circle. One example of a particle accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It is very big, stretching through two countries. Another example is the Tevatron in the United States. The cathode ray tube, used in 20th century televisions and computer monitors is also a simple accelerator for electrons.\nWhen accelerated particles hit other particles such as atoms, smaller pieces come out. This helps people see particles smaller than an atom. Normally those particles cannot be seen, but they can in the particle accelerator. This is because in some ways energy and matter are the same thing. At the high speed created in these machines, some of the movement energy is changed into matter. It is the opposite process that nuclear weapons use; nuclear weapons turn matter into energy. Small amounts of antimatter are also created during the process.\nThe particle accelerator at CERN was set up to search for the Higgs Boson particle, which would complete the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\nParticle accelerators often use very advanced technology. This makes them cost a lot of money which is usually paid by governments."}

For messages sent through an insecure channel, a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is by panduthe one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender, and trust the message.\nDigital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects; properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type. Digital signature are implemented using cryptography. Digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret. Digital signatures are regularly used in USA, European countries and India in government as well as private offices. In India certificate called Digital Signing Certificate (DSC) is widely used for e-filing the business related documents and income tax return filing etc.\nDigital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures.

In India electronic signature do not have any legal significance but digital signature does have legal validity and considered as legally valid signature as per the information technology act, 2000.\nDigital signatures scheme.\nA digital signature system typically consists of two algorithms:\nTwo main properties are required by the digital signature system:\nDigital signature security and attacks.\nThe GMR signature scheme:\nIn 1984, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Ronald Rivest became the first to strictly define the security requirements of digital signature schemes.

The key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted.\nModern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES and AES) and public-key algorithms (such as RSA). Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret. Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone (often by means of a digital certificate). A sender will encrypt data with the public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data.\nSince public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms, modern systems such as TLS and its predecessor SSL as well as the SSH use a combination of the two in which: \nThe simplest method to read encrypted data is a brute force attack\u2013simply attempting every number, up to the maximum length of the key. Therefore, it is important to use a sufficiently long key length; longer keys take exponentially longer time to attack, making a brute force attack invisible and impractical. \nCurrently, commonly used key lengths are:\nKey generation algorithms.\nIn computer cryptography keys are integers. In some cases keys are randomly generated using a random number generator (RNG) or pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), the latter being a computer algorithm that produces data which appears random under analysis. Some types the PRNGs algorithms utilize system entropy to generate a seed data, such seeds produce better results, since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess. \nIn other situations, the key is created using a passphrase and a \"key generation algorithm\", using a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1."}

It is when the keys for decryption and encryption are exactly the same shared secret. You can generate the secret randomly, or from a password, or through a secret key-exchange procedure like Diffie-Hellman.\nSymmetric-key algorithms are very important because they are faster on computers than the other kind:public-key algorithms. In public-key cryptography (asymmetric-key cryptography) the key for encryption can be given to the public with no problem, and everyone can send you secret messages. The key for encryption is \"open\" because, in practice, it cannot be used to get the key for decryption. This is very useful, but public-key cryptography algorithms are very slow on computers, so they are only used to send a secret key. Then symmetric-key algorithms are used for everything else because they are faster.\nThere are two kinds of symmetric-key algorithms, called stream ciphers and block ciphers. Stream ciphers encrypt a message as a stream of bits one at a time. Block ciphers take blocks of bits, encrypt them as a single unit, and sometimes use the answer later too. Blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used; though modern ciphers like the Advanced Encryption Standard use 128-bit blocks.\nExamples of popular symmetric cyphers include Twofish, Serpent, AES (aka Rijndael), Blowfish, CAST5, RC4, TDES, and IDEA.\nIn history, some cryptanalysis methods exploited symmetry, so symmetric systems were less secure. Some attacks are called known-plaintext attacks, chosen plaintext attacks, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. \nOther terms for symmetric-key encryption are secret-key, single-key, shared-key, one-key and eventually private-key encryption. This last term does not have the same meaning that the term \"private key\" has in public-key cryptography.\nSymmetric vs. asymmetric algorithms.\nUnlike symmetric algorithms, asymmetric key algorithms use a different key for encryption than for decryption. Meaning, a user knowing the encryption key of an asymmetric algorithm can encrypt messages, but cannot calculate the decryption key and cannot decrypt messages encrypted with that key. A short comparison of these two types of algorithms is given below: \nSpeed.\nSymmetric-key algorithms are generally much less \"computationally intensive\" than asymmetric key algorithms. In practice, asymmetric key algorithms are typically hundreds to thousands times slower than symmetric key algorithms.\nKey management.\nOne disadvantage of symmetric-key algorithms is the requirement of a \"shared secret key\", with both parties holding the same copy at each end. \nIn order to ensure secure communications between everyone in a group of n people a total of \"n\"(\"n\" - 1)/2 keys are needed, which is the total number of possible communication channels.\nTo limit the impact of a potential discovery by a cryptographic attacker, they should be changed regularly and kept secure during distribution and in service. The process of selecting, distributing and storing keys is known as key management, and is difficult to achieve reliably and securely.\nHybrid cryptosystem.\nIn modern cryptosystems designs, both asymmetric (public key) and symmetric algorithms are used to take advantage of the best of both. \nAsymmetric algorithms are used to distribute symmetric-keys at the start of a session. Once a symmetric key is known to all parties of the session, faster symmetric-key algorithms using that key can be used to encrypt the remainder of the session. This simplifies the key distribution problem, because asymmetric keys only have to be distributed authentically, while symmetric keys need to be distributed in both an authentic and confidential manner.\nSystems that use such a hybrid approach include SSL, PGP and GPG, etc."}

{"id": "137175", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137175", "title": "Duke Nukem 3D", "text": "Duke Nukem 3D is a first-person shooter video game. It was made by 3D Realms and sold by Apogee Software. It was first sold on January 29, 1996. \"Duke Nukem 3D\" is based on the main character from the platform games \"Duke Nukem\" and \"Duke Nukem II\" which were also published by Apogee. The character is voiced by Jon St. John.\nGameplay.\nIn the game, players control Duke Nukem, an action hero from Earth. Players must fight invading aliens that want to take over Earth. The game is made up of 28 levels spread over three chapters. An add-on pack called \"The Plutonium Pak\", later added a fourth episode of 11 new levels, new enemies, and one new weapon.\nThe game is a first person shooter, so the player sees the game from Duke's eyes. Instead of following the character around like a third-person shooter, Duke Nukem is like being \"inside\" Duke, and the player can see Duke's hands and weapons on the screen. The player fights the aliens, most often by shooting at them with different guns, but Duke can also kick, and throw pipe bombs like grenades. The player must also sometimes solve puzzles to find the way through the level.\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" is set \"sometime in the early 21st century\", starting in a badly worn down Los Angeles. The game moves on to places such as lunar space stations. An alien transgenic species has invaded Earth while Duke has been fighting in space. Duke crash lands back on Earth and finds most humans are gone. Only a few women remain as slaves for the aliens. America has been turned into a wasteland, and pornography has become the only entertainment.\nStructure.\nLevel design.\nThe levels of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" take the player outdoors and indoors, on the street, inside military bases, deserts, flooded cities, space stations, moon bases and Japanese villas. Levels were designed with many routes so that players can climb through air ducts, back doors and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden secrets. This makes the levels well suited to multiplayer deathmatchs. The secret items also include (light switches to make it easier to see, water fountains and broken hydrants provide some health points) or simply provide a touch of diversion and strippers who Duke tells jokes to and sometimes they open up their clothes.\nWeapons and equipment.\nThe game includes a range of weapons, some of which, even today, are still unique to the \"Duke Nukem\" series. They range from Duke's foot for kicking, a pistol, a \"Chain gun\" (similar in design to the Nordenfelt gun), pipe bombs, freeze- and shrink-rays, and laser-trip-mines.\nAside from weapons, Nukem can also find 'medkits' to heal himself whenever the player chooses. Steroids make the player move faster, as well as removing the effects of the shrink-ray. Nightvision goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The \"HoloDuke\" device projects a fake hologram of Duke that can be used to trick enemies. Protective boots allow the player to cross dangerously hot or toxic floors. For underwater scenes, scuba gear (an aqua-lung) can be used to let Duke breathe. One of the favorite items is the jetpack which allows the player to fly up in the sky, often to reach hidden weapons or extra health. Many of the secret items such as the jetpack, the scuba gear and the night vision goggles only last for a short time. Weapons also have a limited number of ammunition.\nMonsters.\nThere are many monsters in the game. Some of these are aliens, others mutated humans (the LAPD has been turned into monster pigs). Similar to many first-person shooter games, Nukem encounters a large number of weaker enemies, and a small number of boss enemies (extremely powerful). Like Duke, these \"boss\" enemies have a wide range of weapons and equipment (some weaker enemies have jet packs).\nMultiplayer.\nIn 1996, at the time of the game's release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning and \"Duke Nukem 3D\" could be played on IPX LAN or modem. \"Duke Nukem 3D\" players often used the IPX network utility Kali or the Total Entertainment Network (TEN) online service. Kali allowed users to join a chat room to find opponents. The Total Entertainment Network had hundreds of Duke 3D players online at any time, but players had to pay money monthly for it. The game's levels are often used as the battlegrounds for these online players, bur users are able to create their own levels (\"maps\"). The game also features co-operative play (co-op) which allows players to fight against the aliens instead of each other. In the \"Atomic\" version, a new game play mode was introduced: Duke Tag, a \"capture the flag\" style mode.\nTechnology.\nKen Silverman's Build engine allowed complicated levels. The game could use slopes in the floors. It also supports upwards and downwards mouse aiming (though aiming up and down distorts the graphics due to not having perspective correction).\nDuke Nukem 3D \"Build\" engine had doors/walls that can move sideways. The \"Build\" scripting system allows a whole string of moving and sliding parts with sound effects, such as buildings falling down, earthquakes, and walls that break apart when hit with explosives. One of the more advanced effects is the horizontal sliding platform that can move the player inside a small sliding room, which made it possible to create subway cars moving in a timed sequence around a ring-shaped track.\nThe \"Build\" engine makes horizontally moving platforms possible by allowing several objects to pass through the same 2D space. While inside one of these spaces, it is not possible to see into the other space, and so the Byuild 2.5D engine has no problem rendering one space or the other even though the map data literally shows the two areas to be occupying the same place. Several \"Duke Nukem 3D\" maps use this feature to create bizarre mind-bending maps where multiple large rooms all seem to be occupying one 3D space. One secret level in particular (\"Lunatic Fringe\" from episode 2, Lunar Apocalypse) has a map where the player can travel 720 degrees around a circle and not cross their path. This would be much more difficult to duplicate with modern true-3D map editors and engines. \nAn early beta (testing) version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" called LameDuke was released by 3D Realms as a \"bonus\" one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support.\nLameDuke features four episodes. Some weapons were removed and/or altered from the original versions.\nAdult content.\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" is often thought of as one of the first videogames to have adult humor and sexual themes, especially in the first-person shooter genre. Jokes about American consumerism, Hollywood culture, and sex in the media are made all through the game. Duke's world is out of control and virtually all forms of entertainment in this future have been reduced to pornography by the aliens.\nThe game has been heavily attacked by some critics, who claim that it supports pornography and murder. Media Watch made the following comments about the game.\n\"\"Duke Nukem 3D\" moves the 'shooter' through pornography stores, where Duke can use XXX sex posters for target practice. Duke throws cash at a prostituted woman telling her to 'Shake it, Baby' his gun ever ready. In the game bonus points are awarded for the murder of these mostly prostituted and partially nude women. Duke blows up stained glass windows in an empty church or goes to strip clubs where Japanese women lower their kimonos exposing their breasts. Duke is encouraged to kill defenseless, often bound women.\"\u2014 Media Watch, Teaching Boys To Kill \"\nIn reality, Duke Nukem 3D does not contain a \"bonus points\" system; even accidental shooting of innocents in the game is, sometimes, punished by a sudden group of enemies attacking.\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" was banned in Brazil, along with \"Quake\", \"Doom\" and several other violent first-person shooters. As a response to complaints, censored versions of the game were sold in some countries to avoid being banned. In Germany, the BPjM placed the game on the \"List of Media Harmful to Young People\".\nAdd-on software.\nMany spin-offs and modifications to the original \"Duke Nukem 3D\" were produced after the game's initial launch.\nPlutonium PAK/Atomic Edition: The Atomic Edition of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was first sold in November 1996, and contained the original 3 episode game as well as a new eleven-level fourth episode. The Plutonium PAK was also sold as an upgrade package to convert the first available version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" (v1.3d) to the new Atomic Edition (v1.4, later upgraded again to v1.5). It includes three new enemies: the Protector Drone, the Pig Cop Tank, and a new boss known as The Alien Queen. It also includes a new weapon, the Microwave Expander, with its own special ammunition. It also has several improvements to the software of the game, which allow the game's players to create new enemies and items. Also this version includes a computer controlled second player to simulate multiplayer games.\nEDuke (\"Enhanced Duke Nukem 3D\"): created by Matthew Saettler was given away as a patch for Atomic Edition users on July 28, 2000. On this version 3D Realms removed the copyrights from the software so that players could do anything they liked with it and included a demo mod made by several beta testers. The demo included new Sector-Based Effects, Sprite-Based Elevators, Ladders, a Bouncing Particle Fountain, a Personal Teleporter, and a Sophisticated Translucent Water Effect. Saettler has kept records of his original Eduke site hee for reference.\nDuke Caribbean: Life's a Beach: This is an add-on created by Sunstorm Interactive. Duke relaxes on a tropical island when he discovers that the aliens are having their own \"vacation\" there. This unofficial add-on has a sunny Caribbean atmosphere, nice beaches and hotels as well as some of the original Duke Nukem 3D stuff fit in. It includes levels created by Charlie Wiederhold, who later worked for 3D Realms to work on \"Duke Nukem Forever\", the upcoming sequel to \"Duke Nukem 3D\".\nDuke it out in D.C.: In this storyline, President Bill Clinton is captured by alien forces, and it is up to Duke to save him. This pack has levels that are based on real locations of Washington DC, such as the White House, the FBI headquarters, the Smithsonian museum, and the Washington Monument and others. This game was also developed by Sunstorm Interactive.\nDuke: Nuclear Winter: This one was developed by Simply Silly Software. In the storyline, Santa Claus is mind-controlled by aliens into causing trouble on Earth. Several of the levels take place near the North Pole. This game has sometimes been criticized for using content from the original Duke Nukem 3D.\nDuke Xtreme: An add-on developed by Sunstorm Interactive and contained 50 levels and many items. This version had many technical problems.\nDuke!Zone (Parts 1 and 2): Was sold by WizardWorks and had over 500 levels made by fans of Duke Nukem 3D. \"Duke!ZONE II\", contained three episodes designed by WizardWorks.\nCompilations.\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" has been included in several compilations. A bundle called \"East Meets West\" included the full versions of \"Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition\" and \"Shadow Warrior\". A bundle called \"Duke Nukem: Kill-A-Ton Collection\" featured \"Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition\", \"Duke Xtreme\", \"Duke!ZONE II\", \"Duke Nukem I\" (\"Duke Nukum\"), \"Duke Nukem II\", and various other utilities. Both of these compilations are no longer sold. Earlier packages of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" also included the complete versions of \"Duke Nukem\" I and II as a bonus.\nIn 1998, 3D Realms filed a lawsuit against Micro Star over its add-on pack \n\"Nuke It\" and won. \nSoftware projects working with the GPL licensed source code.\nThe source code to the \"Duke Nukem 3D\" v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as free software under the GPL on April 1, 2003. The artwork remains copyright protected. Many programmers altered so that it can be played on modern computers. As of 2007, these projects gave the game a second life in multiplayer games through the Internet and a growing community is still actively playing.\nThe first modern \"Duke Nukem 3D\" project was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on BeOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows and prossibly others. The icculus.org software would later be used in the Rancidmeat, and later, the xDuke projects.\nOne popular project is Jonathon Fowler's JFDuke3D, which the original creator of \"'Duke Nukem 3D\", Ken Silverman, gave support to, in December 2003. Fowler and Silverman produced a new version of JFDuke3D using Polymost, an OpenGL software product for Build, which uses much more advanced 3D models, and 32-bit color. Another project JFDuke3D called xDuke (not related to the xDuke project by icculus.org/duke3d) was created for play on the Xbox.\nSilverman has helped Fowler with a lot of other software work related to the game. \nHere is a list of some of the most popular \"Duke Nukem 3D\" versions played in 2008:\nEnhancement by fans.\nProjects such as the \"Duke Nukem 3D High Resolution Pack\" were started to give the game the same quality as modern games. There are plans to continue enhancing the \"'Duke Nukem 3D\" software but no new versions of JFDuke3D have appeared since 2005.\nA few projects have been created from the EDuke version (most notably WinEDuke and EDuke 2.1.1), but it was not until the release of Richard Gobeille's EDuke32 (a version of JFDuke3D using Saettler's EDuke software) in 2004 that EDuke became a the most popular with programmers. EDuke32 has been capable of playing OGG music since September 2007. A pack of music was compiled is planned to be part of future versions of the High Resolution Pack. In June 2008, EDuke32 became the first \"Duke Nukem 3D\" project to be played as 64-bit software thanks to the DOSBox team.\nConsole versions.\nIn 1997, \"Duke Nukem 3D\" versions were sold for all the major consoles of the time. \nPlayStation.\nThe PlayStation version, \"Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown\", includes six extra areas and a secret level, which was also included in the PC version. It has some music from the PC version, some from the original, in Streaming XA-Audio made by Mark Knight, new enemies and a new boss.\nSega Saturn.\nThe Sega Saturn version was created by Lobotomy Software and sold by Sega. It uses Lobotomy's \"SlaveDriver\" software. This version uses the Sega NetLink for online play, and is played with the Saturn's analog pad. It also includes a hidden multiplayer mini-game called \"Death Tank Zwei\". The Nintendo 64 version was named \"Duke Nukem 64\" and can be played by four players on a split-screen. There is no music in this version and many items have been renamed to avoid drug and sex references. Other changes include a fully 3D model for the final boss.\nMega Drive/Genesis.\nIn 1998, a Sega Mega Drive version was sold by Tec Toy. The artwork is very simple and only one third of the original game was included. This version was sold in Brazil only. \nTiger Electronics.\nA version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was also released for the Game.com, Tiger's handheld system.\nXbox Live Arcade.\nA Duke Nukem 3D version has been sold for Xbox Live since September 24, 2008. This version includes the ability to \"rewind\" the game to any point if Duke gets killed, video recording and online multiplayer games. The music is slightly better quality using modern MIDI tools."}

The Berar region of present-day Vidarbha in Maharashtra was merged with the Central Provinces in 1903, to form Central Provinces and Berar.\nHyderabad state was in south-central India from 1724 until 1948. It was ruled by the hereditary Nizam. During the Partition of British India in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad declared his intentions of not joining either newly formed India or Pakistan. Sensing trouble, India launched Operation Polo which resulted in the absorption of Hyderabad into the Indian Union, in 1948.\nHistory.\nThe forebears of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty came to India from Samarkand, in Central Asia, but the family actually originated from Baghdad. In 1724, the Mughal Governor of the Deccan, Asaf Jah, Nizam ul-Mulk, Qamar ud-din Khan, established himself as an independent ruler of Deccan. Aurangabad was its first capital city, later Hyderabad became the capital and later lent its name to the state he had created. The first Nizam's successors became closely allied to the British colonialists, assisting them in subduing their enemies, the Maratha dynasty, Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the French. In later years, the Nizam's troops invariably took part in all the main campaigns of the British Indian Army. Large numbers of his troops took part in the First and Second World Wars. These contributions earned for the Nizam unequalled titles and honours from a grateful Emperor. \nThe state was the largest and premier of all princely states within the British Indian Empire. After the Pakistani and Indian Independences, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII decided that the Princely state of Hyderabad will not join the New Dominion of India or Dominion of Pakistan. His decision found favour with Pakistan but not with India. The Nizam\u2019s state was a prosperous one and had its own army, railway and airline network, postal system and radio network. On 15th August, 1947, India declared itself an independent nation. And so did Hyderabad.\nIndependence.\nAt the time of the Independence movement of India, the State of Hyderabad was the largest of the princely states in India. The Nizams of Hyderabad ruled over lands extending to cover 82,698 mi\u00b2 (214,190 km\u00b2) of fairly homogenous territory, bigger than Belarus but smaller than Guyana. The Nizam ruled over a cosmopolitan population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census). These advantages persuaded the Nizam to attempt an Independent existence when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. He refused to join either a Hindu India or a Muslim Pakistan, preferring to form a separate Kingdom within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Hyderabad State had its own Army, Airline, Telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and Radio broadcasting service.\nIn Hyderabad, where no official Referendum was held and where the ruler did not accede, the forced accession to India brought about by Military action, was presumed to have the tacit approval of the predominantly Hindu population. It was one of several annexations by India, with various rationales.\nHistorical dates of Hyderabad Deccan State:\nAdministrative divisions.\nThese were the 4 Divisions and 17 Districts combined which most of the former Princely state is as follows:\nAfter the states were captured they reorganised in 1956, Aurangabad became part of Maharashtra, and Gulbarga became part of Karnataka, the remainder became Andhra Pradesh."}
{"id": "137189", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137189", "title": "Two-nation theory", "text": "The two-nation theory (Urdu: \u062f\u0648 \u0642\u0648\u0645\u06cc \u0646\u0638\u0631\u06cc\u06c1\u200e \"do qaum\u012b nazariya\") is the basis of the creation of Pakistan. The two-nation theory in its simplest way means that cultural, political, religious, economic and social dissimilarities between the two major communities, Hindus and Muslims of the Subcontinent. These differences of outlook, in fact, were greatly instrumental in giving rise to two distinct political ideologies which were responsible for the partition of the sub-continent into two independent states. The two-nation theory was a founding principle of the Pakistan Movement (i.e. the ideology of Pakistan as a Muslim nation-state in South Asia), and the partition of India in 1947.\nThe ideology that religion is the determining factor in defining the nationality of Indian Muslims and Hindus was postulated by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who termed it as the awakening of Muslims for the creation of Pakistan. As a consequence, it spawned creation of many Hindu nationalist organisations, with causes including working towards making India a similar state for the majority of Hindus residing there. \nThere are varying interpretations of the two-nation theory, based on whether the two postulated nationalities can coexist in one territory or not, with radically different implications. One interpretation argued for sovereign autonomy, including the right to secede, for Muslim-majority areas of the Indian subcontinent, but without any transfer of populations (i.e. Hindus and Muslims would continue to live together). A different interpretation contends that Hindus and Muslims constitute \"two distinct and frequently antagonistic ways of life and that therefore they cannot coexist in one nation.\" In this version, a transfer of populations (i.e. the total removal of Hindus from Muslim-majority areas and the total removal of Muslims from Hindu-majority areas) is a desirable step towards a complete separation of two incompatible nations that \"cannot coexist in a harmonious relationship\".\nOpposition to the theory has come from two sources. The first is the concept of a single Indian nation, of which Hindus and Muslims are two intertwined communities. Even after the formation of Pakistan, debates on whether Muslims and Hindus are distinct nationalities or not continued in India. The second source of opposition is the concept that while Indians are not one nation, neither are the Muslims or Hindus of the subcontinent, and it is instead the relatively homogeneous provincial units of the subcontinent which are true nations and deserving of sovereignty across the subcontinent."}

After a few years as a successful merchant, he became very rich. Hewes moved to Edenton, North Carolina at the age of 30 and won over the people of the state with his charm and honorable businesslike character. Hewes was elected to the North Carolina legislature in 1763, only three years after he moved to the state.

It is written in Chinese writing. His given name was Chongba and his family were the Zhus, but Chinese people write their family names first. His name means \"Double Eight\", which is a lucky number in Chinese culture. People say his parents called him that because their ages at the time added together to make 88. He was also their eighth child.\nIn old China, there were many rules about names and who could use them. People used boys' real names but, when they became men at age 20, only older members of their families could call them that. Other people used a special courtesy name to be polite. When he became a man, Zhu Chongba chose the name X\u012bngz\u014dng, meaning that he wanted to bring success in honor of his dead family members. This name is written in the traditional writing used on Taiwan and Hong Kong and in the easier writing now used by the PRC. When he started to become a successful leader, he started to use a third name: . This name is written in Chinese writing. He also sometimes used the courtesy name Gu\u00f3ru\u00ec, meaning \"National Luckiness\".\nIn old China, the Chinese emperors did not number their years from one place. Instead, they gave names to eras (groups of years) any time they wanted. Some emperors made 10 or more eras while they led China. Zhu Yuanzhang started his era when he took Khanbaliq (now Beijing) from the Yuan emperor Toghon Tem\u00fcr in 1368. He said this was the 1st year of the \"Very Warlike Era\", which sounds like \"H\u00f3ngw\u01d4\" and is written in Chinese. He only had this one era when he was emperor, so people also called him the \"Emperor of the Hongwu Era\" or \"H\u00f3ngw\u01d4d\u00ec\" ().\nWhen he was the emperor of China, Chinese people just called him the \"Emperor\". If they met him, they used very polite terms like \"B\u00ecxi\u00e0\" (, \"Your Highness\") to speak to him. After he died, the next emperors gave him a new, long, and very polite name and called him \"M\u00edng T\u00e0iz\u01d4\" (), the \"Greatest Dead Family Member\" of the Ming. After the Xinhai and Communist changes in government of China, people are less polite when they talk about the old emperors. They usually just call him by his everyday name Zhu Yuanzhang like a common person. In English, it's more common to talk about him as the Hongwu Emperor.\nLife.\nZhu Chongba was born on October 21, 1328, during the Yuan part of China's history. His father ZhuWusi () or ZhuShizhen () and his mother Chen Erniang were farmers near a small town called Zhongli near the Huai River in central China. Today, it's within Fengyang, Anhui. His family had so little money that they had no land themselves and needed to borrow other people's farmland. They could not feed all their children and had to give away some of them to other people.\nWhen Zhu was 16 years old, there was no rain for a long time. Because only a little food could grow, everyone left in his family died except for Zhu and one of his brothers. Not knowing what else to do, he joined the Huangjue Buddhist temple as a monk. It did not have much money either and could not give him food for very long, so he soon left. He walked around, asking people for money or food, for about 3 years. Then he went back to Huangjue Temple and stayed there until he was 24. The other monks at the temple taught him to read and write.\nPeople were very angry with the Yuan leaders of China at the time. They were Mongolian people, but most Chinese were Han. Many people started fighting the government. The Yuan army would stop them but hurt many people as they did. Then more people joined in fighting the government. Zhu was one of these. An army destroyed his temple and he started joining the people fighting against them in 1352. He quickly became a leader and joined his fighters with the Red Turbans. In 1356, he took Nanjing and made it the capital of his own small country. He made laws and kept his people mosty safe, so many more people left to join him. This made him even stronger.\nIn 1368, he took Khanbaliq (today's Beijing) and started the Ming Empire in place of the Yuan.\nHe died on June 24, 1398, and was followed as emperor by his grandson Zhu Yunwen, who became the Jianwen Emperor."}

The electrical charge of a single quark is always a fraction (e.g. 2/3). Quarks combine to make a hadron of integer charge, for example, the charges of two 'down' quarks and one 'up' quark combine like this -1/3 -1/3 +2/3 = 0 to make a \"neutrally\" charged \"neutron\". Quarks do not appear alone, they exist in groups and are held together by the strong nuclear force. The word to describe the different types of quarks is \"flavours.\" According to the current standard model there are 6 flavours of quarks. There are two known ways quarks can combine, to give the two categories of hadrons:\nHadrons are also characterized by being affected by the strong nuclear force, which holds them tightly together over a short distance.

The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme. In the worst case, a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key. \nModern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications; for many applications, a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible. Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose.\nAny cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks; this is a conservative approach to security.\nTwo forms of chosen-plaintext attack can be distinguished:"}

The ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success. \nEvery modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks. The process of selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise. On the other hand, poor cipher depends on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection; for this reason, many computer-age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext-only attack but still in use. Examples include:"}
{"id": "137359", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137359", "title": "Chosen-ciphertext attack", "text": "A chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information, at least in part, by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key. \nWhen a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen-ciphertext attack, implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts (i.e., avoid providing a decryption scheme). This can be more difficult than it appears, as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks. Additionally, some cryptosystems (such as RSA) use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them. This permits attacks when hashing is not used on the message to be signed. A better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provably secure under chosen-ciphertext attack, including (among others) RSA-OAEP, Cramer-Shoup and many forms of authenticated symmetric encryption.\nVarieties of chosen-ciphertext attacks.\nChosen-ciphertext attacks, like other attacks, may be adaptive or non-adaptive. In a non-adaptive attack, the attacker chooses the ciphertext or ciphertexts to decrypt in advance, and does not use the resulting plaintexts to inform their choice for more ciphertexts. In an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, the attacker makes their ciphertext choices adaptively, that is, depending on the result of prior decryptions.\nLunchtime attacks.\nA specially noted variant of the chosen-ciphertext attack is the \"lunchtime\" or \"midnight\" attack, in which an attacker may make adaptive chosen-ciphertext queries but only up until a certain point, after which the attacker must demonstrate some improved ability to attack the system. The term \"lunchtime attack\" refers to the idea that a user's computer, with the ability to decrypt, is available to an attacker while the user is out to lunch. This form of the attack was the first one commonly discussed: obviously, if the attacker has the ability to make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries, no encrypted message would be safe, at least until that ability is taken away. This attack is sometimes called the \"non-adaptive chosen ciphertext attack\"; here, \"non-adaptive\" refers to the fact that the attacker cannot adapt their queries in response to the challenge, which is given after the ability to make chosen ciphertext queries has expired. \nMany chosen-ciphertext attacks of practical importance are lunchtime attacks, including, for instance, when Daniel Bleichenbacher of Bell Laboratories demonstrated a practical attack against systems using the PKCS#1; invented and published by RSA Security.\nAdaptive chosen-ciphertext attack.\nA (full) adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack is an attack in which ciphertexts may be chosen adaptively before and after a challenge ciphertext is given to the attacker, with ONE condition that the challenge ciphertext may not itself be queried. This is a stronger attack notion than the lunchtime attack, and is commonly referred to as a CCA2 attack, as compared to a CCA1 (lunchtime) attack. Few practical attacks are of this form. Rather, this model is important for its use in proofs of security against chosen-ciphertext attacks. A proof that attacks in this model are impossible implies that any practical chosen-ciphertext attack cannot be performed. \nCryptosystems proven secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks include the Cramer-Shoup system and RSA-OAEP.

It began on July 19 as a weather system away from the Southeast U.S. Coast. It became a tropical storm later that day. Cristobal stayed away from land, and reached its highest strength as a strong tropical storm on July 21. It moved to the northeast next to the U.S. East Coast and died out on July 23 near Nova Scotia. Because it was a weak storm and never moved onto land, Cristobal's damages were mostly moderate rainfall. The storm dropped 3.43 in (87\u00a0mm) of rain in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding happened. Also, the remnants helped produce rainfall on Nova Scotia, which caused some flooding on roads and in basements.\nStorm history.\nOn July 14, 2008 a weakening weather system stretched across northern Florida, causing thunderstorms. A weak low pressure area formed on July 15 near Tallahassee, which moved towards the southeast into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on July 16, it moved onto land near Tampa, and strengthening was not expected. However, late on July 17, thunderstorms became stronger around the low pressure area, and the system started to get better organized. Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that a tropical depression was forming. At 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300\u00a0UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65\u00a0miles (105\u00a0km) to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.\nIt was located between an area of high pressure to its southeast and another one to the northwest, the depression moved slowly towards the northeast. It became a weak tropical storm during the early afternoon of July 19. In the beginning, the storm was not strong, with few strong thunderstorms. Dry air in the middle- to-upper-levels of the atmosphere caused the storm to not strengthen. However, late on July 20 thunderstorms became more active. Cristobal stayed as a weak tropical storm during the time that it moved close to the South Carolina and North Carolina coast, and the storm never moved onto land. It reached its highest intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras, and stayed the same over the warm Gulf Stream. The storm started to enter cooler waters, and the cyclone quickly moved towards the east-northeastward on July 21 and July 22. In the afternoon of July 22, Cristobal began to weaken while to the south of Nova Scotia. The storm's cloud pattern became weak, and on July 23, it became an extratropical cyclone, and was no longer a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system at 5:00 am EDT (0900 UTC) on July 23.\nImpact.\nBefore the storm, the National Hurricane Center started a tropical storm warning from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to the Virginia\u2013North Carolina border. Before Cristobal formed, it produced light rain in Florida. At Lake Wales, about 6\u00a0inches (150\u00a0mm) of rainfell, mostly in a two-hour period. The rain clogged storm drains, which caused light flooding. The rain caused no serious problems, and helped get rid of dry conditions. The storm dropped in Wilmington, North Carolina. Minor flooding happened there. Because most of the storm stayed out to sea, winds along the coast were light. On the coast, storm surge reached above normal. Winds that were of tropical storm-strength were reported offshore. No severe damage was reported.\nCristobal helped produce heavy rain and flooding in Atlantic Canada. At Baccaro Point on the southern tip of Nova Scotia, 224\u00a0mm (8.8\u00a0in) of rain fell. There was flooding to basements and streets in Cape Sable. A sailor from Connecticut was rescued to the southeast of Halifax by a Canadian helicopter, because his ship capsized in the strong waves."}

Twofish's main features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes, and a relatively complex key schedule. One half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm (key-dependent S-boxes). Twofish uses some elements from other designs; for example, the pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT) from the SAFER family of ciphers. Twofish uses the same Feistel structure as the DES.\nOn most software platforms Twofish is slightly slower than Rijndael (the chosen algorithm for Advanced Encryption Standard) for 128-bit keys, but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys.\nCreators.\nTwofish was designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson; the \"extended Twofish team\" who met to made further cryptanalysis of Twofish and other AES competitors included Stefan Lucks, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Mike Stay.\nTwofish algorithm is free for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever. The Twofish cipher has not been patented and the software example of its specification has been placed in the public domain. However, Twofish is not widely used like the Blowfish, which has been available for a longer period of time.\nCryptanalysis.\nAs of 2008, the best published cryptanalysis on the Twofish block cipher is a truncated differential cryptanalysis of the full 16-round version. The paper claims that the probability of truncated differentials attacks is 2-57.3 per block and that it will take about 251 chosen plaintexts (32 PiB worth of data) to find a good pair of truncated differentials.\nBruce Schneier responds in a 2005 blog entry that this paper does not present a full cryptanalytic attack, but only some hypothesized differential characteristics: \"But even from a theoretical perspective, Twofish is not even remotely broken. There have been no extensions to these results since they were published\" in 2000."}

{"id": "137536", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137536", "title": "Stream cipher", "text": "In cryptography, a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream (keystream) using an exclusive-or (xor) operation. In a stream cipher the Plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state. An alternative name is a state cipher, as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state. In practice, the digits are typically single bits or bytes.\nStream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length. Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements. However, stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly; for example, in particular, the same starting state must never be used twice.\nA stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient cryptographic key, for example 128 bits keys. Based on this key, it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one-time pad encryption algorithm. However, because the keystream is pseudorandom, and not truly random, the security associated with the one-time pad cannot be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure.\nTypes of stream ciphers.\nA stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state. This state is updated in two ways: \nSynchronous stream ciphers.\nIn a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudo-random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages, and then combined with the plaintext (to encrypt) or with the ciphertext (to decrypt). In the most common form, binary digits(bits) are used, and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the exclusive or operation (XOR). This is termed a binary additive stream cipher.\nIn a synchronous stream cipher, the sender and receiver must be in synchronous for decryption to be successful. If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost. To restore synchronisation, various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption. Another approach is to mark the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output.\nIf, however, a digit is corrupted in transmission, rather than added or lost, only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message. This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high; however, it makes it less likely that the error would be detected without further mechanisms. Moreover, because of this property, synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to active attacks \u2014 if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext, he might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit; for example, flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped(Toggled) in the plaintext.\nSelf-synchronizing stream ciphers.\nSelf-synchronizing stream ciphers is another technique that uses part of the previous \"N\" ciphertext digits to compute the keystream. Such schemes are known also as asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey (CTAK). The idea of self-synchronization was patented in 1946, and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving \"N\" ciphertext digits, making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream. Single-digit errors are limited in their effect, affecting only up to \"N\" plaintext digits. It is somewhat more difficult to perform active attacks on self-synchronising stream ciphers rather than synchronous counterparts.\nAn example of a self-synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in cipher-feedback mode (CFB).\nLinear feedback shift register-based stream ciphers.\nBinary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be quickly analysed mathematically. However, the use of LFSRs only is insufficient to provide good security. Various schemes have been designed to increase the security of LFSRs. \nNon-linear combining functions.\nBecause LFSRs are inherently linear, one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of a group of parallel LFSRs into a non-linear Boolean function to form a \"combination generator\". Various properties of such a \"combining function\" are important for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme, for example, in order to avoid correlation attacks. \nClock-controlled generators.\nNormally LFSRs are stepped regularly. One technique to introducting non-linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly, controlled by the output of a second LFSR. Such generators include the stop-and-go generator, the alternating step generator and the shrinking generator.\nThe stop-and-go generator (Beth and Piper, 1984) consists of two LFSRs. One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a \"1\", otherwise it repeats its previous output. This output is then (in some versions) combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate.\nThe shrinking generator uses a different technique. Two LFSRs are used, both clocked regularly in the following way:\nThis technique suffers from timing attacks on the second generator, since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generator's state. This can be improved by buffering the output. \nFilter generator.\nAnother approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non-linear \"filtering function\".\nOther designs.\nInstead of a linear driving device, one may use a nonlinear update function. For example, Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions (T-Functions) with a single cycle on n bit words.\nSecurity.\nTo be secure, the period of the keystream (the number of digits output before the stream repeats itself) needs to be large enough. If the sequence repeats, then the overlapping ciphertexts can be aligned against each other \"in depth\", and there are techniques which allow extraction of the plaintext form ciphertexts generated using these methods. \nUsage.\nStream ciphers are often used in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length as in secure wireless connections. If a block cipher were to be used in this type of application, the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity, since block ciphers cannot directly work on blocks shorter than their block size. For example, if a 128-bit block cipher received separate 32-bit bursts of plaintext, three quarters of the transmitted data need padding. Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding, while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by operating on the smallest transmitted unit (usually bytes).\nAnother advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated by an encryption device that is subject to strict security measures then fed to other devices, e.g. a radio set, which will perform the xor operation as part of their function. The other device can be designed for used in less securely environments.\nRC4 is the most widely used stream cipher in software; others include: \nA5/1,\nA5/2,\nChameleon, \nFISH, \nHelix,\nISAAC, \nMUGI,\nPanama,\nPhelix, \nPike,\nSEAL, \nSOBER,\nSOBER-128 and\nWAKE."}

The seeds may be roasted in a hot oven, and then salted to make a snack.\nOnce the inside of the pumpkin is clean, a face is carved into one side of the pumpkin. The eyes and nose are usually triangles. The mouth is usually filled with jagged teeth. A candle, devotional candle in a candle-holder, or a flashlight is put inside the Jack-o'-lantern and lit. The \"lid\" is replaced. The lid may be placed slightly askew to keep the candle alit. \nIn the United States, a completely carved and lit Jack-o'-lantern is put on the porch, the porch steps, or in a window to welcome trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Once the pumpkin is carved, it is good for nothing else and lasts only a day or two before it starts to rot. Pumpkins used to make Jack-o'-lanterns are inedible. In the United States, mischief-makers steal the Jack-o'-lanterns of their neighbors. The pumpkins are smashed in the street, dropped from a bridge, or otherwise destroyed.\nReferences.\n "}

The lakes were found by the \"Cassini-Huygens\" space probe. The larger lakes are known as maria (seas) and the smaller ones as lac\u016bs (lakes).\nIt was possible that there were seas of liquid methane on Titan and first suggested after reading Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 information that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere, capable of supporting lakes, but exact evidence was not found until 1995 when pictures from the Hubble telescope and other telescopes had already shown some proof of liquid methane possibly in lakes or planet-wide oceans, similar to oceans on Earth.\nThe \"Cassini\" mission proved there are liquid lakes on Titan, but not at first. When the probe arrived in the Saturnian system in 2004, scientists hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans might be seen in reflected sunlight from the surface, but no reflections were found.\nScientists still believed that liquid ethane and methane would be found near Titan's poles, where they expected to find lots of liquid. At Titan's south pole, a large dark area named Ontario Lacus was the first lake identified, possibly created by rain as clouds are often seen in the area. A possible shoreline was also identified at the pole in radar images. As the Huygens-Cassini probe flew by on July 22, 2006, its radar took pictures of the northern part of the planet (which was in its winter), a number of large, smooth areas were found on the surface near the northern pole. Based on this data, scientists announced \"definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturn's moon Titan\" in January 2007. The \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" team decided that the smooth areas are the hydrocarbon lakes they had been searching for, the first lakes found off Earth. Some valleys appear to have rivers.\nThe satellite was not able to show pictures of lakes moving in the wind. The heavy moisture and clouds of methane near Titan\u2019s surface could be a sign of evaporation from lakes. The lakes cover 0.002\u20130.02% of Titan's surface.\nThe \"Cassini-Huygens\" probe flew by in February, 2007, taking radar and camera pictures of some large areas near the north pole that may be large areas of liquid methane and/or ethane, including one sea larger than 100,000\u00a0km\u00b2 (larger than Lake Superior), and another area similar in size to the Caspian Sea. Pictures taken near Titan's southern pole in October 2007 showed similar, but far smaller, areas that look like lakes.\nThe Cassini-Huygens probe, flew very close to Titan in December 2007, and took infrared pictures of the chemicals on the surface and found a lake called Ontario Lacus near the south pole. Scientists studying the infrared pictures decided that one or more of the large lakes in the pictures of Saturn's moon Titan does hold liquid and that the liquid is made of hydrocarbons. They have also found ethane on Titan. This mission proves Titan to be the only other planet known to have liquid on its surface. The lakes make Titan a very important planet for studying weather science. Liquids, gases and temperatures are at play on Titan. This should help the science of weather forecasting.\nLakes were not found near near Titan's center of Titan which was studied on January 14, 2005. A part of the Huygens-Cassini probe landed there. The pictures taken by the probe as it fell showed no open areas of liquid, but showed rivers that had dried. It was at first thought that dark areas near the center of Titan could be a lake of a liquid or tar-like substance, but the probe landed on the dark area, and it is solid without any liquid. A device known as a penetrometer studied the surface as the probe landed and seemed to find wet clay. Scientists believe that the penetrometer may have landed on a large pebble, and they say that the surface is similar to sand made of ice. Pictures taken after the probe landed show a large flat area covered in pebbles. The pebbles may be made of water ice and are partly rounded, which indicates fluids.\nOn February 13, 2008, scientists said that Titans polar lakes contain \"hundreds of times more natural gas and other hydrocarbons than all the known natural gas on Earth.\" The desert near the center of the planet are not liquid but do have more organics than Earth. In June 2008, \"Cassini\"'s Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in a lake in Titan's southern hemisphere.\nPredictions of Titan's clouds are that during in a Saturnian year, liquid moves from the equator to the poles, in clouds, and falls as rain.\nNames of Titans lakes and seas.\nTitanian \"maria\" (large hydrocarbon seas) are named after sea monsters of Earth.\nAreas named \"Lacus\" are believed to be methane lakes. They are named after lakes on Earth."}

He became famous for leading the New South Wales police in their hunt for the bushrangers Ben Hall, John Gilbert, Frank Gardiner and John Dunn.\nEarly life.\nHe was the son of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pottinger of the British East India Company, and his wife Susanna Maria, n\u00e9e Cooke, of Dublin. Henry Pottinger was the first Governor of Hong Kong. Frederick went to Eton from 1844 to 1847. Between 1850 and 1854, Pottinger was an officer in the Grenadier Guards in England. He lost a lot of his mother's money gambling on horse races. In 1856 he took the place of his father as second baronet. He soon gambled away all his money. He owed people a lot of money.\nPoliceman.\nHe went to Australia to search for gold. He joined the New South Wales police force as a mounted trooper. He was an excellent horse rider and spent the next few years working on the gold escort between Gundagai and Goulburn.\nPottinger kept his title secret but in 1860 the inspector-general of police, John McLerie, found out. He was quickly given better jobs. In November he became clerk of petty sessions at Dubbo and on October 1, 1861, assistant superintendent of the Southern Mounted Police Patrol. He wanted to do a good job in the police, but he got into a drunken brawl at Young on 20\u201321 December 1861. He was a publicly warned about his bad behaviour. He was sent to the Lachlan River area. He showed he was a busy but unlucky hunter of bushrangers.\nIn 1862 Pottinger was made an inspector of police for the Western District of New South Wales. In April 1862 he arrested Ben Hall at Forbes on a charge of robbery. Hall he was released because there was not enough evidence to prove he was a robber. Soon afterward Hall joined Frank Gardiner's gang. On June 15, 1862, they robbed the Lachlan gold escort of some \u00a314,000 at Eugowra. This was Australia's biggest gold robbery. Pottinger was able to capture two of the bushrangers quickly. They escaped several days later in a gun battle. Pottinger got back some of the stolen gold.\nDifficulties.\nPeople thought Pottinger made a lot of mistakes. He was in trouble for not having enough police guards on the gold escort and letting his prisoners escape. On the night of August 9, Pottinger and a group of police surrounded the house of Gardiner's mistress, Kate Brown. The bushranger escaped when Pottinger's pistol fired accidentally. They arrested a young boy who they thought was a friend of the bushrangers. When he died from a fever in gaol in March 1863, this was seen to be caused by Pottinger's cruelty. In February 1862 Pottinger was in court at Yass for assault. During a game of billiards he had been called a cheat, a liar and a scoundrel. He hit the person with the billiard cue and smashed his head through a window. On September 27, 1862, Pottinger had appeared before a Bathurst court on a charge of assault. In February 1863 Pottinger went to Sydney for the trial of the escort robbers. He was pushed in the street by people in the crowd. He also threatened a Member of Parliament, J. J. Harpur, with his whip. He didn't like things that Harpur had said about him.\nSacked.\nThe bushrangers in his area became more active. He captured Patrick Daley. On August 17, 1864, he nearly caught James Alpin McPherson.\nIn May 1863 the inspector-general told police to think of new ways to catch the bushrangers. Early in January 1865 Pottinger rode a horse in the Wowingragong races. This was against the rules of the police force. He was sacked (lost his job) on February 16, 1865. Pottinger said that he was just trying to get Ben Hall and John Dunn to come out of hiding. His plan worked and the bushrangers went to the races, only Pottinger didn't see them. Protest meetings against his sacking were held on the gold diggings and in the towns. People signed petitions for him to get his job back. He was regarded as a brave and tireless policeman. Pottinger went to Sydney to try and get back his job. On March 5, 1865, at Wascoe's Inn in the Blue Mountains Pottinger accidentally shot himself in the stomach while trying to get onto a moving coach. He was moved to the Victoria Club in Sydney where he died on April 9, 1865. His brother Henry became the 3rd Baronet. He was buried at St Jude's Anglican Church, Randwick."}

It means the same thing as selective breeding and is an ancient method of genetic engineering. \nSelective breeding is a technique used when breeding domesticated animals, such as dogs, pigeons or cattle. Some of these animals may have traits that a breeder will want to carry over to the next generation. The breeder will therefore select those animals to breed which have that quality, rather than those that do not.\nInbreeding is a particular kind of selective breeding, designed to produce a population which is genetically virtually identical. Such populations are rarely viable outside the laboratory. They lose fertility. To control this, most breeds are outcrossed or backcrossed to wild-type individuals, or at least less inbred stock. The details differ from breed to breed. The improvement when outcrossing is done is called hybrid vigour.\nCharles Darwin used the example of artificial selection to introduce his idea of natural selection. Artificial selection may be contrasted with the process of natural selection. In natural selection, the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits happens. This is because some variations help the organism to have better survival and reproduction. The process maintains or enhances the fitness of a population in its natural habitat. \nArtificial selection may sometimes be unintentional; it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional."}

Selectable markers show the success of a transfection or other procedure meant to introduce foreign DNA into a cell. It is a technique in gene targeting and gene knockout.\nSelectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes; bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign DNA are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic. The antibiotic knocks out cells which do not have the resistant marker. Those bacterial colonies that can grow have successfully taken up and expressed the introduced genetic material.\nAn alternative to a selectable marker is a screenable marker, which allows the researcher to distinguish between wanted and unwanted cells.\nExamples of selectable markers include:"}

{"id": "137614", "revid": "801694", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137614", "title": "Genetic algorithm", "text": "A genetic algorithm is an algorithm that imitates the process of natural selection. They help solve optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms are part of the bigger class of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms imitate natural biological processes, such as inheritance, mutation, selection and crossover. \nThe concept of genetic algorithms is a search technique often used in computer science to find complex, non-obvious solutions to algorithmic optimisation and search problems. Genetic algorithms are global search heuristics.\nWhat is it.\nNatural evolution can be modeled as a game, in which the rewards for an organism that plays a good game of life are the passing on of its genetic material to its successors and its continued survival. In natural evolution, how well an individual performs depends on its who it works with and who it competes with, as well as the environment. Genetic algorithms are a simulation of natural selection on a population of candidate solutions to an optimization problem (chromosomes, individuals, creatures, or phenotypes).\nCandidates are evaluated and crossbred in an attempt to make good solutions. Such solutions may take a lot of time and are not obvious to a human. An evolutionary phase is started with a population of randomly generated beings. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated. Some are randomly selected from the current population (based on their fitness) and modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new population. The cycle repeats with this new population. The algorithm ends either after a set number of generations have passed, or a good fitness level has been reached for the population. If the algorithm has ended due to reaching a maximum number of generations, it does not necessarily mean a good fitness level has been obtained.\nProgramming this on a computer.\nThe pseudocode is:\nExample.\nThe above description is abstract. A concrete example helps.\nApplications.\nIn general.\nGenetic algorithms are good at solving problems that include timetabling and scheduling. They have also been applied to engineering. They are often used to solve global optimization problems.\nAs a general rule of thumb, genetic algorithms might be useful in problem domains that have a complex fitness landscape as mixing is designed to move the population away from local optima that a traditional hill climbing algorithm might get stuck in. Commonly used crossover operators cannot change any uniform population. Mutation alone can provide ergodicity of the overall genetic algorithm process (seen as a Markov chain).\nExamples of problems solved by genetic algorithms include: mirrors designed to funnel sunlight to a solar collector, antennae designed to pick up radio signals in space, walking methods for computer figures, optimal design of aerodynamic bodies in complex flowfields \nIn his \"Algorithm Design Manual\", Skiena advises against genetic algorithms for any task: \"It is quite unnatural to model applications in terms of genetic operators like mutation and crossover on bit strings. The pseudobiology adds another level of complexity between you and your problem. Second, genetic algorithms take a very long time on nontrivial problems. [...] The analogy with evolution\u2014where significant progress require [sic] millions of years\u2014can be quite appropriate.\n[...] I have never encountered any problem where genetic algorithms seemed to me the right way to attack it. Further, I have never seen any computational results reported using genetic algorithms that have favorably impressed me. Stick to simulated annealing for your heuristic search voodoo needs.\"\nBoard games.\nBoard games are a very relevant part of the area of genetic algorithms as applied to game theory problems. Much of the early work on computational intelligence and games was directed toward classic board games, such as tic-tac-toe, chess, and checkers. Board games can now, in most cases, be played by a computer at a higher level than the best humans, even with blind exhaustive search techniques. Go is a noted exception to this tendency, and has so far resisted machine attack. The best Go computer players now play at the level of a good novice. Go strategy is said to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and not just logical analysis as with chess and other more piece-independent games. The huge effective branching factor required for finding high quality solutions heavily restricts the look-ahead that can be used within a move sequence search.\nComputer games.\nThe genetic algorithm can be used in computer games to create artificial intelligence (the computer plays against you). This allows for a more realistic game experience; if a human player can find a sequence of steps which always lead to success even when repeated in different games, there can be no challenge left. Conversely if a learning technique such as a genetic algorithm for a strategist can avoid repeating past mistakes, the game will have more playability.\nGenetic algorithms require the following parts:\nThe fitness function accepts a mutated instantiation of an entity and measures its quality. This function is customized to the problem domain. In many cases, particularly those involving code optimization, the fitness function may simply be a system timing function. Once a genetic representation and fitness function are defined, a genetic algorithm will instantiate initial candidates as described before, and then improve through repetitive application of mutation, crossover, inversion and selection operators (as defined according to the problem domain).\nLimitations.\nThere are limitations of the use of a genetic algorithm compared to alternative optimization algorithms:\nHistory.\nIn 1950, Alan Turing proposed a \"learning machine\" which would parallel the principles of evolution. Computer simulation of evolution started as early as in 1954 with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli, who was using the computer at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His 1954 publication was not widely noticed. Starting in 1957, the Australian quantitative geneticist Alex Fraser published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection of organisms with multiple loci controlling a measurable trait. From these beginnings, computer simulation of evolution by biologists became more common in the early 1960s, and the methods were described in books by Fraser and Burnell (1970) and Crosby (1973). Fraser's simulations included all of the essential elements of modern genetic algorithms. In addition, Hans-Joachim Bremermann published a series of papers in the 1960s that also adopted a population of solution to optimization problems, undergoing recombination, mutation, and selection. Bremermann's research also included the elements of modern genetic algorithms. Other noteworthy early pioneers include Richard Friedberg, George Friedman, and Michael Conrad. Many early papers are reprinted by Fogel (1998).\nAlthough Barricelli, in work he reported in 1963, had simulated the evolution of ability to play a simple game, artificial evolution became a widely recognized optimization method as a result of the work of Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel in the 1960s and early 1970s \u2013 Rechenberg's group was able to solve complex engineering problems through evolution strategies. Another approach was the evolutionary programming technique of Lawrence J. Fogel, which was proposed for generating artificial intelligence. Evolutionary programming originally used finite state machines for predicting environments, and used variation and selection to optimize the predictive logics. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the work of John Holland in the early 1970s, and particularly his book \"Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems\" (1975). His work originated with studies of cellular automata, conducted by Holland and his students at the University of Michigan. Holland introduced a formalized framework for predicting the quality of the next generation, known as Holland's schema theorem. Research in GAs remained largely theoretical until the mid-1980s, when The First International Conference on Genetic Algorithms was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}

Block ciphers can also be used to produce keystreams. For example, the CTR mode (also known as Integer Counter Mode (ICM)) is a block mode that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher.\nExample.\nIn this simple example we will use only the English alphabet of 26 characters from a-z, therefore we will not encrypt numbers, commas, spaces and other symbols. As we have only 26 characters the random numbers in the keystream have to be at least between 0 and 25.\nTo encrypt we add the keystream numbers to the plaintext. And to decrypt we subtract the same keystream numbers from the ciphertext to get the plaintext.\nIf a ciphertext number becomes larger than 25 we wrap it to a value between 0-25. I.e. 26 becomes 0 and 27 becomes 1 and so on.

While the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range, the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the ranges and domains of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second function\u2014quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function.\nIt was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by Diffie and Hellman in 1977. When trying to improve the security of a block cipher, one might get the idea to simply use two independent keys to encrypt the data twice and think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme. Certainly, an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take formula_1 attempts if each key is n bits long, compared to the formula_2 attempts required for a single key. However, Diffie and Hellman, discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme. The attack works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end, thus meeting in the middle.\nAssume the attacker knows a set of plaintext and ciphertext: \"P\" and \"C\". That is,\nwhere E is the encryption function (cipher), and \"K\"1 and \"K\"2 are the two keys.\nThe attacker can then compute \"EK\"(\"P\") for all possible keys \"K\" and store the results in memory. Afterwards he can decrypt the ciphertext by computing \"DK\"(\"C\") for each \"K\". Any matches between these two resulting sets are likely to reveal the correct keys. (To speed up the comparison, the \"EK\"(\"P\") set is stored in an in-memory lookup table, then each \"DK\"(\"C\") can be matched against the values in the lookup table to find the candidate keys.)\nOnce the matches are discovered, they can be verified with a second test-set of plaintext and ciphertext. If the keysize is \"n\", this attack uses only formula_4 encryptions (and formula_5 space) in contrast to the naive attack, which needs formula_1 encryptions (but only formula_7 space)."}

A large set of block ciphers use the scheme, including the Data Encryption Standard \nThe Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule. Therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved.\nFeistel construction is iterative in nature which makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier.\nFeistel networks and similar constructions are product ciphers, and so combine multiple rounds of repeated operations, such as:\nBit shuffling creates the diffusion effect, while substitution is used for confusion.\nTheoretical work.\nMany modern symmetric block ciphers use Feistel networks, and the structure and properties of Feistel ciphers have been extensively explored by cryptographers. Specifically, Michael Luby and Charles Rackoff analyzed the Feistel block cipher construction, and proved that if the round function is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function, with Ki used as the seed, then 3 rounds is sufficient to make the block cipher a pseudorandom permutation, while 4 rounds is sufficient to make it a \"strong\" pseudorandom permutation (which means that it remains pseudorandom even to an adversary who gets oracle access to its inverse permutation). Because of this very important result of Luby and Rackoff, Feistel ciphers are sometimes called Luby-Rackoff block ciphers. Further theoretical studies generalized the construction, and defined more precise limits for security.\nConstruction.\nLet formula_1 be the round function and let\nformula_2 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_3 respectively.\nThen the basic operation is as follows:\nSplit the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (formula_4, formula_5)\nFor each round formula_6, compute (calculate)\nThen the ciphertext is formula_9. (Commonly the two pieces formula_10 and formula_11 are not switched after the last round.)\nDecryption of a ciphertext formula_12 is accomplished by computing for formula_13\nThen formula_16 is the plaintext again.\nOne advantage of this model is that the round function formula_1 does not have to be \"invertible\", and can be very complex.\nThe diagram illustrates the encryption process. Decryption requires only reversing the order of the subkey formula_18 using the same process; this is the only difference between encryption and decryption:\nUnbalanced Feistel ciphers use a modified structure where formula_4 and formula_5 are not of equal lengths. The MacGuffin cipher is an experimental example of such a cipher.\nThe Feistel construction is also used in cryptographic algorithms other than block ciphers. For example, the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) scheme uses a simple Feistel network to randomize ciphertexts in certain asymmetric-key encryption schemes.\nList of Feistel ciphers.\nFeistel or modified Feistel:\nBlowfish,\nCamellia,\nCAST-128,\nDES,\nFEAL,\nICE,\nKASUMI,\nLOKI97, \nLucifer,\nMARS,\nMAGENTA,\nMISTY1,\nRC5,\nTEA,\nTriple DES,\nTwofish,\nXTEA,\nGOST 28147-89\nGeneralised Feistel:\nCAST-256,\nMacGuffin,\nRC2,\nRC6,\nSkipjack"}

Eschatology covers the death of human beings, their souls after their bodily death, the destruction of this world, the resurrection of human souls, the final judgments of human deeds by Allah after the resurrection, and the rewards and punishments for the believers and non-believers. The places for the believers are known as Paradise and for the non-believers as Hell. \nComparative religion.\nComparative religion in Muslim theology is about the differences and similarities between it and other theologies such as Christian and Jewish as explained in the Qur'an and the Prophetic traditions.\nDifferences between various Muslim groups.\nIn the history of Muslim theology, there have been theological schools among Muslims with both similarities and differences with each other about their beliefs.\nSunni view.\nSunni Muslims hold that there are six articles of belief: belief in Allah, in angels, in divinely revealed scripture] like Qur'an, in prophets, in the \"Last Day\" or end times, and in predestination.\nShia view.\nShi`ite Muslims hold that there are five articles of belief: the Divine Oneness and Justice, the Prophethood, the Imamate, and eschatology.\nMu`tazilite view.\nIn the relationship between humans and their creator, Mu`tazilites emphasize human free will over predestination and God's justice over God's omnipotence. Mu'tazilites also believe in the use of logic to decide the true meanings of the Qur'an. This and the principal of Ijtihad, led to their belief in dynamic Fiqh."}

There is also a limit of 160 characters that a text message can send. Longer messages than this will be sent as multiple messages, where the sender has to pay for each individual message. \nText messages are often sent between phone users when an actual phone call is not wanted or needed. For example, they may be used in a situation where silence is needed, or to send something private that one person does not want people near them to hear.

They are caused by various parasites, such as fungi, bacteria, insects and mites. \nPlant galls are abnormal growths of plant tissues similar to benign tumors or warts in animals. \nWhat causes a plant gall can often be known without the actual agent being there. Many types of gall have typical structures. This is true of many galls produced by insects and mites. \nInsect galls on plants give some herbivorous insects their own microhabitat. They are plant tissue which is controlled by the insect. Galls are the habitat and food source for the maker of the gall. The gall may contain nutritious starch and other tissues. Galls often give the insect physical protection from predators.\nInsect galls are usually induced by chemicals injected by the larvae or the adults of the insects into the plants. After the galls are formed, the larvae develop inside until fully grown, when they leave. In order to form galls, the insects must seize the time when plant cell division occurs quickly. The growing season, spring in temperate climates, is longer in the tropics.\nHuman use.\nGalls can be used by humans, and have been since ancient times. One use is to collect the pigment which many galls make. The galls are rich in resins and tannins, from which dyes and inks can be made. Galls can be used to make a mordant for dyeing: mordants make the dye on the cloth permanent. Also, permanent black ink can be made from galls, and that has been done for a long time. \nThe larvae inside the galls may be used as food or as fishing bait, and some galls have medicinal uses."}

The former Chrysler Corporation acquired the Jeep brand, along with the remaining assets of its owner American Motors, in 1987. Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off-road vehicles, but has also included pickup trucks in the past.\nThe original Jeep was the prototype Bantam BRC. Willys MB Jeeps went into production in 1941 specifically for the military. Arguably that makes them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs. The Jeep became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II. It remained so in the postwar period. The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war. Doug Stewart notes:\nThe first civilian models were produced in 1945. It inspired a number of other light utility vehicles, such as the Land Rover. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations. In 2007 Jeep began manufacturing crossover SUVs with its Compass and Patriot models. This led to the 2013 Jeep Cherokee midsize crossover."}

{"id": "137908", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137908", "title": "Mandaeism", "text": "Mandaeism or Mandaeanism (Mandaic: Mandaiuta, \"Mand\u0101'iyya\") is a monotheistic religion. The religion has a strong dualistic world view. Its followers, the Mandaeans, think highly of Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist.\nOriginally, Mandaeism was practiced mainly in the countries around the lower Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers that surround the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. Today, this area belongs to Iraq and Khuzestan Province in Iran. Because they were persecuted in that area, many Mandaeans have left that area and now live abroad. This is commonly called diaspora. Most left for Europe, Australia and North America.\nThere are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide, and until the 2003 Iraq war, almost all of them lived in Iraq. The 2003 Iraq War reduced the population of Iraqi Mandaeans to approximately 5,000 by 2007. Most Iraqi Mandaeans fled to Syria and Jordan under the threat of violence by Islamic extremists and the turmoil of the war.\nThe Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private\u2014what has been reported of them and their religion has come primarily from outsiders, particularly from the Orientalists J. Heinrich Petermann, Nicholas Siouffi, and Lady Ethel Drower.\nMandaean beliefs.\nMandeism is the religion of the Mandaean people. It is based on a common history and heritage. There is no fixed set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist. The corpus of Mandaean literature is quite large. It also covers topics such as eschatology, the knowledge of God, and the afterlife. It only does this in an unsystematic manner. Apart from the priests, very few people know it. \nBasic beliefs.\nAccording to E.S. Drower, the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features, which also appear in various forms in other gnostic sects:\nMandaeans believe in marriage and procreation, and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world. They put a high priority on family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not practice celibacy or asceticism. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong drink and red meat. They look forward to a future liberated from the influence of the Torah, which they consider to be evil in origin. While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons, they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one.\nMandaean religious texts.\nThe Mandaeans have many religious texts. The most important of them is the \"Genz\u0101 Rabb\u0101\" or Ginza. The Ginza is a collection of history, theology, and prayers. The \"Genz\u0101 Rabb\u0101\" is divided into two halves \u2014 the \"Genz\u0101 Sm\u0101l\u0101\" or \"Left Ginza\" and the \"Genz\u0101 Yemin\u0101\" or \"Right Ginza\". \nBefore the printing press was invented, people copied texts by hand. The people doing this were called scribes. Each person's handwriting is special in certain ways. This was the same with scribes. A scribe might join two letters in a certain way, or he might do the dots on those letters that have them in a special way. Jorunn J. Buckley looked at these special marks the copyists left in the Left Ginza. That way he was able to show that the copying of that text goes back to the to the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. These special marks show that the Mandaeans existed during the late Arsacid period at the very latest. A legend called \"Harr\u0101n G\u0101wet\u0101\" also strengthens this. According to this legend, the Mandaeans left Palestine after the destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st century AD and settled inside the Arsacid empire. Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic empires, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity.\nOther important books include the \"Qolast\u0101\", the \"Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans,\" which was translated by E.S. Drower. One of the most important works of Mandaean scripture is the \"Dra\u0161a d-Iahia\" \"the Book of John the Baptist\". This book is accessible to both laymen and initiates. There are also many other religious texts such as ritual commentaries, which are generally only consulted by the members of the priesthood.\nThe language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally written is known as Mandaic, and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script. The majority of Mandaean lay people do not speak this language. Some members of the Mandaean community in Iran ( about 300-500 out of a total of ca. 5000 Iranian Mandaeans) continue to speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language.\nChief prophets.\nMandaeans have several prophets. Iahia or Iuhana \"John the Baptist\" has a special status, higher than his role in Christianity and Islam. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion. They only worship him as one of their greatest teachers. They trace their beliefs back to Adam.\nMandaeans maintain that Jesus was a \"m\u0161iha kdaba\" \"false messiah\" who changed the teachings given to him by John. The Mandaic word \"k(a)daba\", however, comes from two roots: the first root, meaning \"to lie,\" is the one traditionally given to Jesus; the second, meaning \"to write,\" might provide a second meaning, that of \"book\". Some Mandaeans, who are motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit, maintain that Jesus was not a \"lying Messiah\" but a \"book Messiah\". The \"book\" in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts.\nLikewise, the Mandaeans believe that Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad were false prophets, but recognize other prophetic figures from the monotheistic traditions, such as Adam, his sons Hibil (Abel) and \u0160itil (Seth), and his grandson Anu\u0161 (Enosh), as well as Nuh (Noah), his son Sam (Shem) and his son Ram (Aram). The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors.\nPriests and laymen.\nThere is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests. According to E.S. Drower (\"The Secret Adam\", p. ix):\nThere are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the \"tarmidia\" \"disciples\" (Neo-Mandaic \"tarmid\u0101n\u0101\"), the \"ganzibria\" \"treasurers\" (from Old Persian \"ganza-bara\" \"id.\", Neo-Mandaic ') and the \"ri\u0161amma\" \"leader of the people.\" This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has lain vacant for many years. At the moment, the highest office currently occupied is that of the ', a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis (ca. 3rd c. BCE) and which may be related to the \"kamnaskires\" (Elamite &lt;qa-ap-nu-i\u0161-ki-ra&gt; \"kapnuskir\" \"treasurer\"), title of the rulers of Elymais (modern Khuzestan) during the Hellenistic age. Traditionally, any ' who baptizes seven or more ' may qualify for the office of \"ri\u0161amma\", though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate.\nThe contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19th century. In 1831, an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the surviving acolytes (\"\u0161gandia\"), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them.\nRelated groups.\nAccording to the \"Fihrist\" of ibn al-Nadim, Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was brought up within the Elkasaites (\"Elcesaites\" or \"Elchasaite\") sect. The Elkasaites were a Christian baptismal sect which may have been related to the Mandaeans. The members of this sect wore white and performed baptisms like the Mandaeans. They lived in east Judea and northern Mesopotamia. According to the \"Harran Gawait\u0101\" legend, the Mandaeans migrated to southern Mesopotamia from there. Mani later left the Elkasaites to start his own religion. Mandaean scholar S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derberg showed that Mani's \"Psalms of Thomas\" were closely related to Mandaean texts. This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature.\nOther groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the \"Nasoraeans\", described by Epiphanius, and the Dositheans, mentioned by Theodore Bar K\u014dn\u012b in his \"Scholion\". Ibn al-Nadim also mentions a group called the \"Mughtasila\", \"the self-ablutionists,\" who may be identified with one or the other of these groups. The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms.\nIt is difficult to say if groups such as the Elkasaites, the Mughtasila, the Nasoraeans, and the Dositheans are related to the Mandaeans or to one another.\nThe names say that there are a number of different groups. Much of the teaching of these groups is secret. This makes it difficult to see the nature of these groups or the relationships between them.\nMandaeans today.\nPersecution.\nUnder Saddam Hussein, the Mandeans were recognised as a religious minority. Many of them are craftspeople, like smiths or traders of gold and silver. These people belonged to the middle classes. Since the change of government in Iraq, islamic extremists have harassed them. There are also reports of attacks on women who refuse to veil themselves. Most Iraqi Mandaeans have fled as a result, and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces extinction.\nIn Iran, Mandeans do not have a problem with violence, but they are prohibited from fully participating in civil life because of \"Gozinesh\" Law. This law and other \"gozinesh\" provisions require a \"religious screening\" for people who want to access employment, education, and a range of other areas. A very important part of this screening procedure is devotion to the tenets of Islam. These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans.\nMany left because of the Iraq War.\nThere were over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s. In 2007, only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there; over 80% of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan. This is a result of the Iraq War. There are small Mandaean populations in Australia (c. 3,500 as of 2006), Canada, the USA (c. 1,500), the UK (c. 1,000) and Sweden (c. 5,000).\nThe current status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call for their government to extend refugee status to the community. In 2007, the New York Times ran an op-ed in which Swarthmore professor Nathaniel Deutsch called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community:"}

In block ciphers, the S-Boxes are used to make the relation between the key and the ciphertext (coded text) difficult to understand\u2013Shannon's property of confusion. The S-Boxes are carefully chosen to resist cryptanalysis (decoding).\nIn general, an S-Box takes some number of input bits, \"m\", and transforms them into some number of output bits, \"n\": an \"m\"\u00d7\"n\" S-Box can be implemented as a lookup table with 2\"m\" words of \"n\" bits each. Fixed tables are normally used, as in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), but in some ciphers the tables are generated dynamically from the key; e.g. the Blowfish and the Twofish encryption algorithms. Bruce Schneier describes IDEA's modular multiplication step as a key-dependent S-Box.\nOne good example is this 6\u00d74-bit S-Box from DES (S5):\nGiven a 6-bit input, the 4-bit output is found by selecting the row using the outer two bits, and the column using the inner four bits. For example, an input \"011011\" has outer bits \"01\" and inner bits \"1101\"; the corresponding output would be \"1001\".\nThe 8 S-Boxes of DES were the subject of intensive studies for many years cause of a concern that a method of bypassing the DES cipher to obtaining access to the plaintext\u2013a \"vulnerability\" (\"susceptibility\") known only to its designers\u2013might have been \"planted\" (inserted) in the cipher. In 1994, the S-Box design criteria were finally published by its designers after the public rediscovery of differential cryptanalysis, showing that they had been carefully tuned the design to increase resistance against differential cryptanalysis attacks. Other research had already indicated that even a very small modification to one of the 8 S-Box used by the DES could weaken it very much.\nThe design of good S-Boxes was the subject of a great amount of research; now much more is understood about their use in block ciphers than when the DES S-Boxes were released."}

In a cipher with good diffusion, flipping an input bit should change each output bit with a probability of one half (this is termed the Strict Avalanche Criterion).\nSubstitution (a rule for replacing plaintext symbols by another) has been identified as a mechanism for primarily confusion (see S-box); on the other hand transposition using P-box (rearranging or swapping the order of symbols) is a technique for diffusion, although other mechanisms are also used in modern practice, such as linear transformations (e.g. in AES).

It was meant to be a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard. IDEA very like an earlier cipher called Proposed Encryption Standard (PES), but with some improvements. Because of this, IDEA was first called IPES (Improved PES).\nThe cipher is patented in a number of countries but can be used by anyone for non-commercial use. The name \"IDEA\" is also a trademark. The patents will expire in 2010\u20132011. Today, IDEA is licensed worldwide by a company called MediaCrypt.\nIDEA was used in Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) v2.0 after the cipher used in v1.0, BassOmatic, was found to be breakable. IDEA can be used with the OpenPGP standard.\nIDEA operates on 64-bit blocks, using a 128-bit key. It contains a series of eight identical transformations (\"rounds\") and one output transformation (the \"half-round\"). It does this for a total of 8.5 rounds. The processes for encryption and decryption are similar.\nIDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups \u2014 modular addition and multiplication, and bitwise eXclusive OR (XOR) \u2014 which are chosen to be \"algebraically incompatible\".\nEach of the eight round uses six sub-keys, while the half-round uses four; for a total of 52 sub-keys. Each sub-key is a 16-bit in length. The first eight sub-keys are extracted directly from the 128-bit key, with K1 being the lowest sixteen bits and K8 is the highest sixteen bits; further groups of eight keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits after the creation of the previous group; six rotations generate all sub-keys.\nThe designers analyzed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is unsusceptible only under certain assumptions. No successful linear or differential attacks have been reported. Some classes of weak keys have been found \u2014 E.g. (Daemen \"et al.\", 1994) \u2014 but these are of little importance, being so rare to be explicitly avoided. As of 2007, the best attack which applies to all keys can break IDEA if reduced to 6 rounds (the full IDEA cipher uses 8.5 rounds).\nIn 1996, Bruce Schneier wrote about IDEA, \"In my opinion, it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time.\" (\"Applied Cryptography\", 2nd ed.) However, by 1999 he was no longer recommending IDEA due to the availability of faster cryptographic algorithms, some progress in its cryptanalysis, and the issue of patents. "}

The Yemeni governorates of Hadhramaut, Lahij, Al Mahrah and Ta'izz were affected the worst by the floods, and most of the deaths were in Hadhramaut.\nDetails.\nBefore the flooding was several days of rain starting on October 23, as the remains of a tropical cyclone moved over the area. Rain continued, with weather systems coming in from neighbouring Saudi Arabia and northern Somalia, causing severe flooding in some areas of Yemen. Better conditions are expected by Sunday.\nThousands of families fled Hadhramaut alone; many schools were used as evacuee shelters, but these could only hold 10% of the affected. Search and rescue teams said that the number of deaths may increase due to the likelihood of people trapped in flooded houses. Electricity and telephone lines were cut off, and many homes were damaged.\nReaction.\nThe Yemeni government promised to supply tents as a means of emergency shelter, along with other emergency supplies, with six transport aircraft loaded with supplies taking off from Sanaa on Saturday and more scheduled for later. President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered the creation of a committee to provide aid to affected civilians. Also, the United Arab Emirates declared their intent to provide relief. However, several residents in the city of Shibam say that government assistance and support, if any, is low.\nThe Organisation of the Islamic Conference declared the situation a \"national catastrophe\" and started a drive on Saturday to collect funds for the relief of flood victims.\nYemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh said, \"The damages... are great and the catastrophe is also great.\"\nDamage.\nAlong with deaths, about 730 homes were destroyed, along with businesses and other building projects. The severe thunder of the thunderstorms resulted in at least nine deaths from lightning in the Al Mahrah, Ta'izz and Lahij governorates. The rain also destroyed large amounts of farmland and killed large numbers of livestock."}

It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005. Also, it made the third strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall. Dean moved west-northwest from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean Sea. It became into a very strong hurricane, reaching Category\u00a05 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before moving south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm moved onto land on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on August\u00a021 as a Category\u00a05 storm. It moved across the peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, as a weakened storm, but still a hurricane. It strengthened for a short time before making a second landfall in Veracruz near Tecolutla, Mexico, on August 22. Dean slowly moved to the northwest, weakening into a low pressure area which dissipated over the southwestern United States.\nThe hurricane's strong winds, waves, rains and storm surge caused over 45\u00a0deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.5\u00a0billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean severely damaged agricultural crops, especially those of Martinique and Jamaica. When it reached Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category\u00a05 storm, but it missed large cities and its exceptional Category\u00a05 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category\u00a02 storm. Because of the damage, the name \"Dean\" was retired, and will not be used again for a tropical cyclone."}

He was seven years old when his father, Aga Khan II, died in 1885. He was one of the founders and the first president of the All-India Muslim League, and served as President of the League of Nations from 1937-38.\nHe was born in Karachi, in what was British India. He was given a religious education, and also a European education. He attended Eton and Cambridge University, and was a frequent visitor to Britain. \nHis followers celebrated his anniversaries as Imam in 1937, 1946 and 1954 by weighing him in gold, diamonds and platinum. The proceeds were spent on welfare and development in Asia and Africa. Girls schools were set up in the remote northern areas of what is now Pakistan. He was knighted by Queen Victoria, and later made a member of the Privy Council.\nHis choice of successor.\nAt the end of his life, Sir Sultan Mohammed did a remarkable thing. In his will, he disinherited his son, Aly Khan, in favour of his grandson, Karim.

At the age of three he was an orphan, so he was brought up by his grandfather in Cambridge. At the age of seven he became a chorister at King's College Chapel Choir. In 1826 he entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he spent ten years studying. His piano teachers were W. H. Holmes, Dr William Crotch and later Cipriani Potter \nIn 1833 he was made organist of St Anne's Church, Wandsworth and in that same year met Felix Mendelssohn who invited him to Germany. He went there four times, making long tours. He was welcomed and admired by famous musicians including Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann. Schumann later dedicated his \"Symphonic Studies\" to Bennett. He also often performed at the Leipzig Gewandhaus.\nMusic.\nAlthough he knew the works of Bach and Mozart very well, many of his compositions were clearly influenced by Mendelssohn. As well as being known as one of Europe's most brilliant pianists, his music was well known for its new ideas, excitement and poetic beauty. His compositions include four overtures, six piano concertos, four symphonies, a chamber trio, sextet, several piano works and two song cycles to be followed later in life by a cello duo, a late Symphony in G minor, a Cantata The May Queen for the opening of Leeds Town Hall in 1858, and an oratorio The Woman of Samaria for the 1867 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival.\nOf his 80 published compositions, nearly half are now available on CD, the most popular being the Overture \"The Naiades Op 15\", the \"Chamber Trio Op 26\" and the \"Piano concerto No 4 in F minor Op 19\".\nLater life.\nFrom 1844 for fifteen years he organized the popular Chamber Music Concerts in the Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square in London introducing a number of famous soloists to the British public. In 1848 he became a founding Director of Queen's College London and in the following year of Bedford College, now part of London University. In this way he helped women to get equal opportunity in education. \nIn 1849 he formed the Bach Society (later to be reformed as the Bach Choir) in London to produce and conduct the first English performance of Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\" on 6 April 1854.\nIn 1856 he succeeded Wagner as conductor of the Philharmonic Society Orchestra. He was the first person to be given their Gold Medal. In 1866 he was chosen to be Professor of Music at Cambridge University having got an MA and Mus Doc. From 1866 until his death he was Principal of the Royal Academy of Music. A scholarship and Prize in his name continues to be awarded to this day. In 1870 Oxford University gave him an Hon DCL and a year later he was knighted. \nHe died on 1st February 1875 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.\nSeveral of his family later became well known in music and theatre. Bennett left a large music library which is now at the Bodleian Library in collaboration with his great-great-grandson Barry Sterndale-Bennett (b 1939) which continues to be available for research purposes.\nReferences.\nSee: The Life of Sterndale Bennett by JR Sterndale Bennett (Cambridge University Press 1907) and William Sterndale Bennett- a Descriptive Thematic Catalogue by Rosemary Williamson (Clarendon Press 1996) "}

Most computers have a large amount of space, but not infinite space. Also, most people are willing to wait a little while for a big calculation, but not forever. So if your problem is taking a long time but not much memory, a space-time tradeoff would let you use more memory and solve the problem more quickly. Or, if it could be solved very quickly but requires more memory than you have, you can try to spend more time solving the problem in the limited memory.\nThe most common condition is an algorithm using a lookup table. This means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down. One way of solving this problem is to write down the entire lookup table, which will let you find answers very quickly, but will use a lot of space. Another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything, which uses very little space, but might take a long time.\nA space-time tradeoff can be used with the problem of data storage. If data is stored uncompressed, it takes more space but less time than if the data were stored compressed (since compressing the data decreases the amount of space it takes, but it takes time to run the compression algorithm). \nLarger code size can be used to increase program speed when using . This technique makes the program code longer for each iteration of a loop, but saves the computation time needed for jumping back to the beginning of the loop at the end of each iteration. \nIn the field of cryptography, using space-time tradeoff, the attacker is decreasing the exponential time required for a brute force attack. use partially precomputed values in the hash space of a cryptographic hash function to crack passwords in minutes instead of weeks. Decreasing the size of the rainbow table increases the time required to iterate over the hash space. The meet-in-the-middle attack attack uses a space-time tradeoff to find the cryptographic key in only formula_1 encryptions (and formula_2 space) compared to the expected formula_3 encryptions (but only formula_4 space) of the normal attack. \nDynamic programming is another example where the time of solving problems can be decreased by using more memory."}

{"id": "138093", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138093", "title": "Carnivorous plant", "text": "Carnivorous plants are plants which get nutrients from trapping and eating animals. They are often called insectivorous plants, because they usually trap insects. Since they get some of their food from animals, carnivorous plants can grow in places where the soil is thin, or poor in nutrients. This is true for soils with little nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcrops. Charles Darwin wrote the first well-known book on carnivorous plants in 1875.\nThis ability of plants to catch animals is true carnivory. There are more than twelve genera in five families. These include about 625 species that attract and trap prey, produce digestive enzymes, and use their nutrients. In addition, there are more than 300 species in several genera that show some but not all of these characteristics. These are usually called \"protocarnivorous plants\".\nTrapping mechanisms.\nInsectivorous plants have leaves that are made like pitchers or bladders which catch insects. Today, five different ways of trapping are known\nThese traps are all classified as \"active\" or \"passive\". \"Triphyophyllum\" is a liana (a climber in tropical forests). It has three types of leaves. When needed, it puts out long leaves. These are passive 'flypapers' which hide mucus. The leaves of the plant do not grow or move as a response to moving prey. The Sundew \"Drosera\", on the other hand, is an active flypaper. All species of Sundew are able to move their sticky tentacles in response to a contact. The tentacles are very sensitive and will bend toward the center of the leaf in order to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible. According to Darwin, the touch of legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to cause this response. This helps the catch and digestion of prey.\nThe Venus flytrap, \"Dionaea muscipula\", is one of a very small group of plants able to move fast. When an insect or spider crawls along the leaves and touches a hair, the trap closes \"only if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first touch\". The two-touch trigger avoids wasting energy on objects with no food value.\nBorderline cases.\nA carnivorous plant must attract, kill and digest prey. It must then also benefit from digesting the prey. In most cases, this will yield amino acids and ammonium ions. There are some cases, where plants catch the prey, but they do not digest it. Rather, they have a symbiosis with another organism, which feeds on the prey. One such case is the species of the sundew \"Roridula\", which forms a symbiosis with the assassin bug. The bugs eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' faeces.\nEvolution.\nFew fossil carnivorous plants have been found, and then usually as seed or pollen. Carnivorous plants are generally herbs, without wood or bark. True carnivoury has probably evolved independently at least six times. \nSome think all trap types have a similar basic structure\u2014the hairy leaf. Hairy leaves do catch and hold drops of rainwater, which helps bacterial growth. Insects land on the leaf, are caught by the surface tension of the water, and suffocate. Bacteria start to decay the insect, and release nutrients from the corpse. The plant then absorbs the nutrients through its leaves. This 'leaf feeding' can be found in many non-carnivorous plants. Plants that were better at holding water and insects therefore had a selective advantage. Rainwater can be retained by cupping the leaf, leading to pitfall traps. Alternatively, insects can be caught by making the leaf stickier, leading to flypaper traps."}

It is often desired in cryptography. The effect says that a lot of the output must change, even when the input changes only a little. In good block ciphers this means: A small change in the key or the plaintext should cause a strong change in the ciphertext. \nThis means that small changes can spread fast, when the algorithm uses iterations. Thus, every bit of the output depends on every bit of the input.\nThe term \"avalanche effect\" was first used by Horst Feistel (Feistel 1973). Later, the concept was identified by \"Shannon's property of confusion\". \nIf a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not satisfy the avalanche effect to a significant degree, then it has poor randomization. Thus, a cryptanalyst can make forecasts about the input, if given only the output. This may be sufficient to partially or completely break (crack) the algorithm. \nIt is one of the primary design objectives when people create a strong cipher or cryptographic hash function. They try to build a good avalanche effect in it. Mathematically this uses the butterfly effect. This is why most block ciphers are product ciphers. It is also why hash functions have large data blocks. \nName.\nThe name comes from landslides. A small rock can fall down, go along with some snow and make a destructive landslide. The rock was small, but was able to cause a lot of destruction. This is the same as what this effect does. A small change in the input (the rock) should change the output (the landscape).\nStrict avalanche criterion.\nThe Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC; a \u201cstrong landslide criterion\u201d) is a property of boolean functions. It is of importance to cryptography. It is satisfied if all output bits change with a probability of 50 percent, if a single input bit is changed. \nThe SAC was built on the concepts of evolution completeness and avalanche. It was introduced by Webster and Tavares in 1985. Nowadays it is a requirement for every modern cryptographic system. It was e.g. satisfied by all finalists of the AES competition.\nBit independence criterion.\nThe Bit independence criterion (BIC; a criterion independent from the bit) is a criterion. It goes: When a single input bit is changed (inverted), two output bits should change independently of each other. This applies to all bits. \nIt would e.g. not be satisfied, if the one output bit only changes, when the other output bit also changes. They might only change, because the input bit changed. Otherwise, the output bits would depend on each other. "}

Most of those are made of oak wood.\nA barrel is also used to measure liquids. One barrel of oil is 158.987 litres (42 US gallons). It is shortened as \"bbl\". This use may have come from the early Pennsylvanian oil fields where wooden barrels were used to store and move oil around. In 1866, the people of West Virginia started using it regularly. At this time, the amount was set to 42 American gallons. It was later world-wide for measuring amounts of oil and pricing it. Today, oil is rarely stored or transported in actual barrels, but the term \"barrel\" is still used to mean a 42-gallon measurement.\nA barrel can also be used to measure dry goods. For example, a barrel can mean 196 pounds (about 89 kilograms) of flour.\nDifferent sizes.\nThe size of some standard barrels is not the same in all countries. Some countries have different sizes for different liquids.\nHistory.\nThe first people to start using barrels were the Celts about 350 BC.

Her owner, \"Aunt Viv\" (Jamie Lee Curtis), has to go to Italy, so she leaves Chloe with her niece, Rachel Ashe Lynn (Piper Perabo). Rachel and her friends go on vacation to Mexico, and Chloe gets dognapped by an evil Mexican dognapper who at first wants to use her in dog fights but sees her value and wishes to put her at randsome (have the owners have to pay money to get her back). In the meantime, Papi (voiced by George Lopez), a male chihuahua who is in love with her is on the lookout for her. Chloe makes friendship with a lonely German Shepherd named Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia) who travels with her to protect her from the evil Doberman (voiced by Edward James Olmos) who wants to kill her and steal her diamond collar to return it to the dognapper who owns him.\nMusic.\nThe music to \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" was written by composer Heitor Pereira, who recorded the score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers.\nReception.\n\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" earned $29 million USD in its opening weekend.

He likes to remain anonymous and not let people know his true identity. He often draws in high visibility public places such as on buildings or train stations. His paintings are often about politics, war and other important topics.\nHis satirical street art and mind-hurting pictures combine dark humour with graffiti. The graffiti is done with a stencilling technique. Such works have been done on streets, walls, and bridges of cities throughout the world.\nBanksy's work started in the Bristol underground scene, which had collaborations between artists and musicians. According to graphic designer Tristan Manco and the book \"Home Sweet Home\", Banksy \"was born in 1974 and raised in Bristol, England. The son of a photocopier technician, he trained as a butcher but became involved in graffiti during the great Bristol aerosol boom of the late 1980s\". His style is similar to Blek le Rat, who began to work with stencils in 1981 in Paris, and to members of the anarcho-punk band Crass, which did a graffiti stencil campaign on the London Underground system in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nBanksy displays his art on public surfaces such as walls and even going as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell photos of street graffiti directly himself. However, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder. Banksy's first movie, \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\", billed as \"the world's first street art disaster movie,\" made its debut at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The movie was released in the UK on 5 March 2010. In January 2011, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary for the movie.\nIdentity.\nThere have been numerous rumours as to Banksy's identity. Names often suggested include Robert Banks and Robin Gunningham.\nIn 2004 an alleged photograph of him in Jamaica surfaced. In October 2007 the BBC website featured a photo allegedly taken by a passer-by in Bethnal Green, London, purporting to show Banksy at work with an assistant, scaffolding and a truck. From the pictures, Banksy's identity was thought to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol on 28 July 1973. Gunningham was educated at Bristol Cathedral Choir School and Leicester Polytechnic, now De Montfort University, and according to a former friend, was \"extremely talented at art\".\nLived with artist Luke Egan. Around 2000, when Banksy moved from Bristol to London, Gunningham is known to have moved from Bristol to a London flat in Hackney, and a number of Banksy's most famous works appeared nearby. At that time, Gunningham lived with Jamie Eastman, who worked for a record label that used illustrations by Banksy.\nIn May 2009, the \"Mail on Sunday\" once again speculated about Gunningham being Banksy. This \"new Banksy rat\" story was also picked up by \"The Times\", and the \"Evening Standard\".\nIn response to reports that Banksy was Robin Gunningham, Banksy's agent refused to either confirm or deny the reports.\nSimon Hattenstone from \"The Guardian\" is one of the very few people to have interviewed him face to face. Hattenstone describes him as \"a cross of Jimmy Nail and British rapper Mike Skinner\" and \"a 28-year old male who showed up wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a silver tooth, silver chain, and one silver earring.\" In the same interview, Banksy claimed that his parents think he is a painter and decorator.\nBanksy himself states on his website: "}

The basic position is called the missionary position. In it, the receiving partner lies on their back with legs apart. The penetrating partner lies on top of the receiving partner, facing them. The penetrating partner enters so that the base of the penis rubs the clitoris.\nFrom behind.\nMost of these positions can be used for either vaginal, or anal sex.\nThe receiving partner is kneeling or on all four limbs. The penetrating partner inserts their penis from behind. This position is sometimes called as the doggy style position.\nOn top.\nMost of these positions can be used for either vaginal, or anal sex.\nThe receiving partner is on their hands and knees with their bottom exposed. The penetrating partner then pumps away at the receiving partner's vagina or anus with his penis.\nSitting and kneeling.\nMost of these positions can be used for either vaginal, or anal sex.\nThe penetrating partner sits down, with their legs stretched out. The receiving partner sits on top and wraps their legs around the penetrating partner. This is called pounding on the spot.\nStanding.\nIn the basic standing position, both partners stand facing each other and have vaginal sex. The shorter partner can stand on a stair if the partners are different heights. It may be easier if the person being penetrated has their back to a wall.\nAnal.\nMost of the above positions can be used for anal sex.\nOutercourse.\nOutercourse or frottage is sometimes part of foreplay, or to avoid intercourse.\nGenital-genital sex.\nGenital-genital sex, sometimes called GG rubbing, is when two people rub penises together (sometimes called frot, or frottage), or when two people rub vulvae together (sometimes called tribadism, or scissoring).\nOral sex.\nOral sex is the term given to genital stimulation by the mouth. People may engage in oral sex as part of foreplay before intercourse, or during, or following intercourse. It may also be performed for its own sake.\nFellatio.\nFellatio is a kind of oral sex that involves a person letting their penis be licked, or \"eaten\" by their partner. The person's partner can be any gender, or sex. There are several ways to have oral sex.\nNote: Fellatio doesn't have to involve two people. Some people with male genitalia have a long-enough penis and a good enough stretch to lick or put their own penis into their mouth. However, this is called autofellatio or autofellation.\nCunnilingus.\nCunnilingus is oral sex involving a person's female genitals. There are several ways to have oral sex.\n69.\n\"Main article:\" 69 (sex position)\nOral sex between two people at the same time is called 69. Partners can be lying side-by-side, lying one on top of the other, or standing with one partner holding the other upside down.\nAnilingus.\nPositions for anilingus, also known as \"rimming\", \"anal-oral sex\", or \"rimjob\" are:\nGroup sex.\nMore than one person with male genitalia.\nWhen three people have sex with each other, it is called a threesome.

Mirepoix consists of onions, carrots and celery (either common Pascal celery or celeriac). Mirepoix is used in many dishes, such as stocks, soups, stews and sauces. It is used either raw, roasted or saut\u00e9ed with butter. Mirepoix is known as the holy trinity of French cooking.\nThese three ingredients are commonly referred to as aromatics. Similar such combinations, both in and out of the French culinary repertoire, sometimes include leeks, parsnips, garlic, tomatoes, shallots, mushrooms, bell peppers, chilies, and ginger. For the combination \"mirepoix au gras\", or a \"Matignon\", ham or pork belly are used as additional ingredients. In Cajun cuisine, a mirepoix or trinity is a combination of onions, celery and bell peppers.\nThey may be used in different combinations, as dictated by the cuisine and the dish itself.\nTraditionally, the ratio for mirepoix is 2:1:1 of onions, celery, and carrots. The ratio for bones to mirepoix for stock is 10:1. When making a white stock, or \"fond blanc\", parsnips are used instead of carrots to maintain the pale color.\nMirepoix derives its name, as many other elements of French cuisine do, from the patron of the chef who established it, in this case one of the house of L\u00e9vis, seigneurs of Mirepoix since the eleventh century and a famous name in Languedoc. The particular member of the house of L\u00e9vis whose chef is credited by the \"Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\" with giving a name to an old technique is Charles-Pierre-Gaston Fran\u00e7ois de L\u00e9vis, duc de L\u00e9vis-Mirepoix (1699-1757), mar\u00e9chal de France and ambassador of Louis XV.

The first was to attack the supply lines of the other side. The second was to keep open its own supply lines, the Axis to their own armies in North Africa and the Allies to supply the island of Malta. The third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea.\nOutside of the Pacific ocean, the Mediterranean saw the largest conventional naval warfare during the war. In particular, Allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of Malta.\nRadar and fuel.\nItalian warships had a general reputation as well-designed and good-looking. But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour. All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war, although this was partly offset by their good \"rangefinder\" and \"fire-control\" systems. In addition, whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act, Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters (\"Supermarina\"). This could lead to action being avoided when the Italians had a clear advantage (e.g., During \"Operation Hats\"). Italian Naval Headquarters was conscious that the British could replace ships lost in the Mediterranean, whereas Italian Navy resources were limited and there was a terrible lack of fuel.\nThe Italian Navy entered the war with only one year of fuel required to operate normally. By 1943 the lack of fuel prevented naval operations far away from the coasts of Italy.\nThe Allies had \"Ultra\" intercepts from Bletchley Park, which predicted the Italian movements, and radar, which enabled them to locate the ships and to range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the \"Fleet Air Arm\" and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the initial Italian defeats (like in the \"Battle of Cape Matapan\").\nForces.\nThe Axis forces in this campaign were:-\nThe Allied forces in this campaign were:-\nHistory.\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France. On the following day, Italian bombers attacked Malta on what was to be the first of many raids.\nThe first clash between the rival fleets, the Battle of Calabria, took place on 9 July 1940, just four weeks after the start of hostilities. This was inconclusive (neither side won), and was followed by a series of small ship actions (the battle of the \"Espero\" convoy, battle of Cape Spada) during the autumn.\nIn spring 1940 the British Royal navy attacked at Mers el Kebir (Algeria) the French navy of Vichy, sinking two battleships and other minor ships.\nIn November, the RN mounted an aerial attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto harbour, crippling three capital ships and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean.\nThree months later the fleets clashed again at the Battle of Cape Matapan. This was a major Allied victory; three Italian cruisers were sunk, and a battleship damaged in a two-day battle ending in a night action.\nFollowing this the Allies suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Crete, supporting the army when the island was invaded by the Germans.\nIn spring 1941 the Greek and Yugoslavian navy were destroyed and/or made captive by the Italians (with help from the German air force) during the Italo-German war in the western Balkans against Greece and Yugoslavia.\nFollowing the battle of Crete in the summer of 1941, the Royal Navy got the better of things in the central Mediterranean in a series of successful convoy attacks, (such as the \"Duisburg\" convoy and the Battle of Cape Bon) until the events around the First Battle of Sirte and the Raid on Alexandria in December swung the balance of power in the Axis favour.\nThe Italian Navy's most successful attack was when divers planted mines on British battleships during the raid on Alexandria harbour (19 December 1941). HMS \"Queen Elizabeth\" and HMS \"Valiant\" were sunk (but ten months later raised and returned to active service). During those ten months the Italian Navy enjoyed a temporary control of the Mediterranean sea (called by Mussolini's propaganda the \"Mare Nostrum\", meaning \"our sea\").\nA series of hard fought convoy battles (Second Battle of Sirte in March, Operations Harpoon and Vigorous in June, and Operation Pedestal in August) were victories for the Axis but ensured Malta's survival, until the Allies regained the advantage in November 1942.\nIn Sept 1943 with the Italian collapse and the surrender of Italian fleet, naval actions in Mediterranean became restricted to actions against U-boats and by small craft in the Adriatic and Aegean seas.\nMajor Axis and Allied amphibious operations.\nThe following are the major amphibious operations staged during the Battle of the Mediterranean:"}

The string is called the 'hash value', 'message digest', 'digital fingerprint', 'digest' or 'checksum'.\nThe ideal hash function has three main properties:\nUses.\nFunctions with these properties are used as hash functions for a variety of purposes, not only in cryptography. Practical applications include message integrity checks, digital signatures, authentication, and various information security applications.\nA hash function takes a string of any length as input and produces a fixed length string which acts as a kind of \"signature\" for the data provided. In this way, a person knowing the \"hash value\" is unable to know the original message, but only the person who knows the original message can prove the \"hash value\" is created from that message.\nA cryptographic hash function should behave as much as possible like a random function while still being deterministic and efficiently computable. A cryptographic hash function is considered \"insecure\" from a cryptographic point of view, if either of the following is computationally feasible:\nAn attacker who can find any of the above computations can use them to substitute an authorized message with an unauthorized one.\nIdeally, it should be impossible to find two different messages whose digests (\"hash values\") are similar. Also, one would not want an attacker to be able to learn anything useful about a message from its digest (\"hash values\").

It was claimed that it may break the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher faster than a brute force attack. \nAES is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret and classified information. Finding a technique that can decrease the amount of time it takes to break the secret message without having the key could cause wide damage. \nIn 2004 it was shown by one of the cryptanalysts, that the algorithm does not perform as described in its published paper. In addition, the method requires long effort. Unless shortened, the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to a brute force attack. Therefore, it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future. However, the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current AES.\nThe XSL attack relies on first analyzing the \"internal design\" of a cipher then deriving a system of quadratic simultaneous equations. These systems of equations are typically very large, for example 8000 equations with 1600 variables for the 128-bit AES. Several methods for solving such systems are known. In the XSL attack, a specialized algorithm, termed XSL (eXtended Sparse Linearization), is then applied to solve these equations and compute the key.\nThe attack is well-known and famous for requiring only a handful of known plaintexts to perform. Previous methods of cryptanalysis, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis, often require unrealistically large numbers of known or chosen plaintexts, which make them impossible to realize."}

The population in 2006 was nearly 50,000 people. It is the county town of County Waterford. Waterford is the fifth largest city in Ireland. It is also the oldest city in Ireland. \nWaterford is home to the Waterford Crystal glass factory, which exports crystal all around the world. This glass factory has made many famous pieces, including the New Years Eve glass ball used in Times Square in New York. The factory closed in 2009 leading to over 1,500 job losses. The factory reopened again in the city centre in June 2010 and is now a popular tour. Tourists also come to Waterford to visit the Waterford Viking Triangle.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 914 by the Vikings. The Norman King Henry II of England landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then Dublin were made royal cities and in the Middle Ages, Waterford was Ireland's second city after Dublin. As a result, King Henry VII gave the city its motto: \"Urbs Intacta Manet Waterfordia (Waterford remains the untaken city)\".\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, Waterford remained a Catholic city and participated in an independent Catholic government from 1642 to 1649. This was ended by Oliver Cromwell, who brought the country back under English rule; his son-in-law Henry Ireton finally took Waterford in 1650 after a battle.\nThe 18th century was a period of wealth for Waterford. Most of the city's best buildings came during this time. A permanent military base was established in the city with the Waterford Barracks at the end of the 18th century.\nDuring the 19th century, great industries such as glass making and shipbuilding started in the city.\nReginald's Tower is the oldest urban civic building in Ireland, and the oldest monument to retain its Viking name. It is Waterford's most recognisable landmark. It is believed to be the first building in Ireland to use mortar. Reginald's Tower is in the Viking Triangle, a favourite visiting area for tourists which contains three museums and the Waterford Crystal factory and showroom. \nThe River Suir, which flows through Waterford City, has provided a basis for the city's long maritime history. The place downriver from Waterford where the River Nore and the River Barrow join the River Suir is known in the Irish language as \"Cumar na dTr\u00ed Uisce\" (\"The confluence of the three waters\"). Waterford Port has been one of Ireland's major ports for over 1000 years. In the 19th century, shipbuilding was a major industry. The owners of the Neptune Shipyard, the Malcomson family, built and operated the largest fleet of iron steamers in the world between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s, including five trans-Atlantic passenger liners.\nTransport.\nWaterford Airport is a regional airport. Waterford is also known for where of one of the biggest European airlines, Ryanair started from. The first flight was a 14-seat Bandeirante aircraft, flying between Waterford and Gatwick Airport."}

The lost energy is converted into heat, raising the temperature of the system. Such systems are called dissipative systems. \nFor example, a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate. The dissipative nature depends on the nature of the wave: an atmospheric wave, for instance, may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass, and at higher levels due to radiative cooling.\nIn computational physics.\nIn computational physics, a numerical dissipation is also known as \"artificial dissipation\" or \"artificial diffusion\" or \"numerical diffusion\". They all mean this: when the pure advection equation--which, by definition, \"is free of dissipation\"--is solved by a numerical approximation method that reduces the amplitude and changes the shape of the initial wave in a way analogous (similar) to a diffusional process, the method is said to contain 'dissipation'.\nIn river hydrology.\nIn Hydrology, dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy. Various devices are designed in stream-beds (river-banks) to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms. Very often these devices look like small waterfalls or cascades, where water flows vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic force."}

Porta Alchemica is the only survivor of the five gates of the Palombara villa, there was an lost door on the opposite side enabling to give it a date of 1680, there were also four other inscriptions lost on the walls of the mansion inside the villa.\nLegend.\nAccording to a legend dated 1802 sent us by the scholar \"Francesco Girolamo Cancellieri\" , a pilgrim \"stibeum\" (from Latin: \"stibium\" = antimony) was hosted in the villa for a night. The \"pellegrino\", identifiable with the alchemist \"Giustiniani Bono\", stayed for a night in the gardens of the villa in search of a mysterious herb capable of producing gold, the next morning he was seen disappearing forever through the door, but left behind a few flakes of gold fruit of a successful alchemical transmutation, and a mysterious paper full of puzzles and magic symbols that would contain the secret of the Philosopher's Stone.\nThe marquis had engraved on the five gates of the villa Palombara and on the walls of the mansion, the content of the manuscript with symbols and riddles in the hope that one day someone would be able to understand them.\nHistory.\nThe interest of the Marquis Palombara for alchemy was born probably on his attendance since 1656, at the roman court of queen Christina of Sweden, at \"Riario\" palace (today \"Palazzo Corsini\") on the slopes of the \"Gianicolo\" hill. After the queen converted to Catholicism, she abdicated the throne of Sweden and he spent much of the rest of his life exiled in Rome from 1655 until her death in 1689.\nQueen Christina had an alchemical laboratory in Riario palace attended by people like the esotericists \"Giuseppe Francesco Borri\", and the learned Athanasius Kircher possessor of the mysterious Voynich manuscript of enigmatic scripture full of magic symbols. According to a legend the same \"Porta Alchemica\" was built in 1680 as a celebration of a successful alchemical transmutation occurred in Riario laboratory.\nBetween 1678 and 1680 Borri aka \"Giustiniani Bono\", collaborated with Athanasius Kircher for construction of Porta Alchemica in Palombara villa. Gian Lorenzo Bernini, famous architect and Kircher friend, designed the door. On the door was transcribed the secret formula for producing gold discovery in those years in alchemical laboratory of queen Christina. Because of this revelation the Marquis Palombara, Bernini and Athanasius Kircher were murdered by poison at 28 November 1680, probably by the same Borri. The secret of the Philosopher's Stone was lost forever, or perhaps continued to be used by Borri. (It's amazing the similarity between portraits of Borri and the mysterious Count of St. Germain).\nA mysterious symbol.\nThe particular drawing on the pediment of Porta Alchemica, with the two triangles overlap and inscriptions in Latin, appears almost exactly the same on the title of the book alchemical \"Aureum Seculum Redivivum\" of \"Henricus Madatanus\" aka \"Adrian von Mynsicht\" (1603-1638). The title page of the original of 1621 is very different, because the design that was inspired the Marquis Palombara appears exactly only in the posthumous edition of 1677. The same drawing appears in a bookmark possessed by \"Berenger Sauni\u00e8re\", who became the parish priest at Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau in 1885. The motto \"Aureum Seculum Redivivum\" recalled this \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" in the Great Seal of the United States, motto also of the Bavarian Illuminati heirs of the 17th century Rosicrucianism."}

Apartheid or 'separate development' was introduced by the National Party after the 1948 election to protect European interests and identity by enforcing separation between the 'races'. The term is often used to describe the gap between whites and nonwhites, and global socioeconomic inequality, the existence of which has been proven by statistics. As in South Africa, there is a hierarchy of group rights in the world:\nAlthough not explicitly classified by race, this hierarchy is banded by colour. Nationality laws of most countries, and the European Union, explicitly enshrine this \u2018classification'.\nEuropean countries control most of the world's technology and weapons, and 20% of the global population, the richest percentage, take in 71.3% of income. Although most people of the world are not white, thereby making whites a minority, this minority often holds power in society. Most Western countries have laws against racial discrimination and active anti-racist movements, however much Western thought, law and action are exclusive, operating through institutional and indirect discrimination rather than overt racism. Their system of exclusion are more sophisticated, this prevents the West from exercising unconditional power in international affairs.\nThe term apartheid was famously used by Thabo Mbeki, the then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons the modern-day status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era. Mbeki got the term from the book Unravelling Global Apartheid (1996) by Titus Alexander, initiator of Charter 99, a campaign for global democracy, who was present at the UN Millennium Summit."}

It was created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. It was first shown on CBS on September 24, 2007.\nOverview.\nThe show starts by being centred on two male Caltech scientists who share an apartment in Pasadena, California. They are in their twenties and are both single for the first two seasons. One is an experimental physicist from New Jersey (Leonard Hofstadter). The other is a theoretical physicist from Texas (Sheldon Cooper). Sheldon has Asperger syndrome and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and has a very low sex drive. They live across the hall from an attractive, bottle-blonde waitress from Nebraska (Penny). She is single and lives on her own for most of the show's run. She tried to become an actress, but only got a role in a television advertisement and a role in a B-movie called Serial Apeist as well as its sequel.\nLeonard and Sheldon's geekiness and intellect are contrasted with Penny's social skills, popularity and lively sex life for comedic effect. Two equally geeky, single friends of Sheldon and Leonard's, Jewish Howard and Indian Rajesh, are also main characters. Howard lived with his mother during the first few seasons. Raj lives on his own. The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions. In March 2014, it was announced that \"The Big Bang Theory\" would continue for at least three more seasons on CBS.\nThe show began as a sitcom about four geeky, male scientists and their fun-loving, under-educated, socially successful waitress neighbour. Much of the humor revolved around the differences between scientists and the rest of the characters, especially Penny. From season 3 onwards, the show changed greatly into being a show about couples and families. Bernadette Rostenkowski was brought in during season 3 and started a relationship with Howard. The couple later married and had a daughter. Amy Farrah-Fowler was also brought in during season 3 and started a relationship with Sheldon; they later got engaged. Leonard and Penny became a couple and married. The show frequently shuffles between romantic comedy and relationship drama.\nEleven seasons have been shown. The show's twelfth season was its last.\nA prequel series, \"Young Sheldon\", began in 2017.\nProduction history.\nThe show was first developed for the 2006-2007 television season. At that time, it was very different from the show that was later broadcast. Only Jim Parsons &amp; Johnny Galecki were part of the original pilot. The character now played by Kaley Cuoco was much meaner to the geeks. CBS did not pick the show up, but gave Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre a second chance. They brought in Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar. They retooled the show.\nThe second pilot of \"The Big Bang Theory\" was directed by award-winning television directing veteran James Burrows. He decided not to stay with the show. This reworked pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007. Before its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered September 24, 2007. It was picked up for a full 22-episode season order on October 19, 2007.\nProduction on the show was halted on November 6, 2007 by the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike. When the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season for the 2008-2009 television season.\nThe show returned on March 17, 2008 . It had an earlier time slot and nine new episodes. The second season premiered, in the same slot, on September 22, 2008. During that season, the show's ratings grew.

{"id": "138477", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138477", "title": "Smilodon", "text": "Smilodon was a genus of saber-toothed cat. There were three species. \"Smilodon gracilis\" (or \"S. fragilis\") was the ancestral, smaller, species (2.5 to 0.5 million years ago).\n\"Smilodon populator\" (1 mya to 10 kya) was a large, heavy species from eastern South America. It was 1.2 m high at the shoulder, 2.1 m (83\u00a0in) long on average. With an estimated weight of 220 to 400\u00a0kg, it was among the heaviest known felids. Its upper canines reached 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) and protruded up to 17\u00a0cm (6.7\u00a0in) out of the upper jaw.\n\"Smilodon fatalis\" (or \"S. californicus\"; 1.6 mya to 10,000 years ago) was the famous cat known from the Rancho La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. The tar, a bit like asphalt, has yielded about a million bones of late Pleistocene mammals, of which 162,000 bones are from \"Smilodon\", representing perhaps 1200 individuals. The cat was about the size of a female lion, but weighed more, perhaps 200\u00a0kg. It was about 1 metre tall at the shoulders.\nTeeth and jaws.\n\"Smilodon\" is most famous for its relatively long canines, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about long in the largest species \"Smilodon populator\". Those of \"S. fatalis\" reached their full size in 18 months at a growth rate of 7\u00a0mm/month. These canine teeth were slender and had fine serrations. They were fragile and could not have bitten into bone. Therefore, the cats did not use their long teeth to take down prey. Only when their prey was subdued did they use their teeth.\nMethod of attack.\nThe front limbs on these cats were longer and stronger than modern cats, and from that, and its teeth, its method of attack must have been different. An educated guess would be: they were ambush predators, which clung on round the neck of their prey, and slashed at the underside of the throat. This contrasts with the method of the modern lion, which brings down its prey by weight of numbers, and clamps its jaws over the prey's nose and mouth. The prey dies of suffocation.\n\"Smilodon\"&amp;apos;s gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This makes the gape wide enough to allow \"Smilodon\" to slash the throats of their victims without closing their jaws in a bite.\n\"Smilodon\"'s niche was closer to a leopard's, which is also an ambush predator. They both need cover to get close to prey.\n\"Smilodon\" had relatively short legs and a short, bobbed tail. Its front legs were especially powerful. Its body was adapted for springing onto prey, but it was not a very fast runner.\nFauna and flora in the Smilodon's environment.\nDuring the last ice age, there were many possible prey species from the La Brea location: mammoths, bison, horse, camel, ground sloth, pronghorn, tapir, deer,(elk and others). Most of these were extinct by 5 to 10,000 years ago. The pressures of a major climate change and human hunting were thought to be the main causes.\nThere was more plant cover at that time. Juniper, oaks, ragweeds, cedars, redwoods, sagebrush, sycamore, thistle and walnut grew in the environs. \"Smilodon\" survived so long as its prey had vegetation."}

{"id": "138483", "revid": "1061539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138483", "title": "The Daily Show", "text": "The Daily Show (known currently as The Daily Show with Trevor Noah (Jon Stewart was the host from 1999-2015 and Craig Kilborn from 1996-1998) is an Emmy Award winning news parody television program. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central in the United States. The half-hour long program was first shown on Monday, July 22, 1996. It was first hosted by Craig Kilborn. Kilborn acted as its anchorman until December 1998. Jon Stewart took over as host in January 1999. Many changes were made to the program at that time. Stewart retired in 2015. The show will be hosted by South African comedian Trevor Noah in September 2015.\nUnder Stewart, \"The Daily Show\" has become more strongly focused around politics and the national media. It is much different to the more character-driven comedy which was shown more during Kilborn's time on the program. Stewart's final broadcast aired on August 6, 2015.\nThere have been many other on-air contributors to \"The Daily Show\" with some called \"correspondents\", including Dave Attell, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, Ed Helms, Rob Corddry, Susie Essman, Olivia Munn, Buck Henry, Lewis Black, Kristen Schaal, Larry Wilmore, and John Oliver.\nOpening segment.\nEach episode begins with announcer Drew Birns announcing the date and the introduction, \"From Comedy Central's World News Headquarters in New York, this is \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\"\". Previously, the introduction was \"This is \"The Daily Show\", the most important television program, ever.\" The host then opens the show with a monologue drawing from current news stories and issues. Previously, the show had divided its news commentary into sections known as \"Headlines\", \"Other News\", and \"This Just In\"; these titles were dropped from regular use on October 28, 2002, and were last used on March 6, 2003. Some episodes will begin with a 1\u20133 minute intro on a small story (or small set of stories) before fully transitioning into the main story of the night.\nCorrespondent segments.\nThe monologue segment is often followed by a segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent, either at the anchor desk with the host or reporting from a false location in front of a greenscreen showing stock footage. They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against the host's straight man. Some correspondent segments involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people related to the featured issue.\nCorrespondents are typically introduced as the show's \"senior\" specialist in the story's subject, and can range from relatively general (such as Senior Political Analyst) to absurdly specific (such as Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme stereotypes of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as \"Senior Latino Correspondent\", \"Senior Youth Correspondent\" or \"Senior Black Correspondent\".\nFormer correspondents John Oliver and Wyatt Cenac at the launch of \"Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race\"\nWhile correspondents stated to be reporting abroad are usually performing in-studio in front of a greenscreen background, on rare occasions, cast members have recorded pieces on location. For instance, during the week of August 20, 2007, the show aired a series of segments called \"Operation Silent Thunder: The Daily Show in Iraq\" in which correspondent Rob Riggle reported from Iraq. In August 2008, Riggle traveled to China for a series of segments titled \"Rob Riggle: Chasing the Dragon\", which focused on the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nJason Jones traveled to Iran in early June 2009 to report on the Iranian elections, and John Oliver traveled to South Africa for the series of segments \"Into Africa\" to report on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In March 2012, Oliver traveled to Gabon, on the west African coast, to report on the Gabonese government's decision to donate $2 million to UNESCO after the United States cut its funding for UNESCO earlier that year. On July 19, 2016, Roy Wood Jr. reported live from the Republican National Convention and talked about Donald Trump's African-American support.\nTopics have varied widely; during the early years of the show, they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of \"The Daily Show\". However, as the show began to gain popularity\u2014particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections\u2014most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.\nRecurring segments.\nMain article: List of The Daily Show recurring segments\nSome segments have recurred periodically throughout different tenures, such as \"Back in Black\" (segments hosted by comedian Lewis Black) &amp; \"Your Moment of Zen\". Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a common segment of the show has been dubbed \"Mess O' Potamia\", focusing on the United States' policies in the Middle East, especially Iraq. Elections in the United States were a prominent focus in the show's \"Indecision\" coverage throughout Stewart &amp; Noah's time as host (the title \"InDecision\" is a parody of NBC News' \"Decision\" segment). Since 2000, under Stewart's tenure, the show went on the road to record week-long specials from the cities hosting the Democratic and Republican National Convention. For the 2006 U.S. midterm elections, a week of episodes was recorded in the contested state of Ohio. The \"Indecision\" &amp; \"Democalypse\" coverage of the 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 elections all culminated in live Election Night specials.\nWith Noah as host, one new recurring segment has been \"What the Actual Fact\", with correspondent Desi Lydic examining statements made by political figures during speeches or events. Under Noah, the continuation of \"Democalypse\" and \"Indecision\" also took place with live shows after the Republican National Convention and Democratic National Convention. For the first time, under Noah, the show also went live after all three U.S. presidential debates in 2016.\nInterviews.\nIn the show's third act, the host conducts an interview with a celebrity guest. Guests come from a wide range of cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes, pundits, policy experts and political figures. During Stewart's tenure, the show's guests tended away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction authors and political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials. In the show's earlier years it struggled to book high-profile politicians. (In 1999, for an \"Indecision 2000\" segment, Steve Carell struggled to talk his way off Republican candidate John McCain's press overflow bus and onto the Straight Talk Express).[\"citation needed\"] However its rise in popularity, particularly following the show's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 elections, made Stewart according to a \"Rolling Stone\" (2006) article, \"the hot destination for anyone who wants to sell books or seem hip, from presidential candidates to military dictators\". \"Newsweek\" labeled it \"the coolest pit stop on television\".\nProminent political guests have included U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, former British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Bolivian President Evo Morales, Jordanian King Abdullah II, Estonian Prime Minister Taavi Roivas, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former Mexican President Vicente Fox.\nThe show has played host to former and current members of the Administration and Cabinet as well as members of Congress. Numerous presidential candidates have appeared on the show during their campaigns, including John McCain, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nClosing segment.\nIn a closing segment, there is a brief segue to the closing credits in the form of the host introducing \"Your Moment of Zen\", a humorous piece of video footage without commentary that has been part of the show's wrap-up since the series began in 1996. The segment often relates to a story covered earlier in the episode, but occasionally is merely a humorous or ridiculous clip. Occasionally, the segment is used as a tribute to someone who has died.\nSometimes, before the \"Your Moment of Zen\", this segment is used for quick promotions. The host might promote the show that follows right after their broadcast, such as promoting the show \"@midnight\". This time has also been used to promote films, books or stand-up specials that are affiliated with the host.\nIn October 2005, following \"The Colbert Report\"'s premiere, a new feature (sometimes referred to as the toss) was added to the closing segment in which Stewart would have a short exchange with \"our good friend, Stephen Colbert at \"The Colbert Report\"\", which aired immediately after. The two would have a scripted comedic exchange via split-screen from their respective sets. In 2007, the \"toss\" was cut back to twice per week, and by 2009 was once a week before gradually being phased out. It was used on the 2014 mid-term election night and again just before the final episode of \"The Colbert Report\" on December 18, 2014, and returned upon the premiere of \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore\". Stewart then regularly tossed to Wilmore at the end of his Monday night episodes. Under Noah, the \"toss\" has been used for \"The Opposition with Jordan Klepper\" and \"Lights Out with David Spade\".\nStudio.\nOutside of the \"Daily Show\" studio, pictured in 2007, during Stewart's tenure\nThe host sits at his desk on the elevated island stage in the style of a traditional news show. The show relocated from its original New York studio in late-1998 to NEP Studio 54 in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where it remained until 2005, when the studio was claimed by \"The Colbert Report\". On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location. The set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests' couch, which had been a part of the set since the show's premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a \"Bring Back the Couch\" campaign. The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by \"Daily Show\" contributor Bob Wiltfong. The couch was eventually featured in a sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a small sum of money.\nThe sign over the entryway of the current \"Daily Show\" studio\nOn April 9, 2007, the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.\nOutside of the \"Daily Show\" studio, pictured in 2019, during Noah's tenure\nOn September 28, 2015, the show debuted a new set alongside the debut of Trevor Noah's tenure. According to Larry Hartman, Noah took a lot of inspiration from Stewart's set. A second on-stage 'jumbo-tron' was added and the colours of the set were made lighter. The graphics, intro, theme music, lower thirds, logo, etc. were also all revamped. On July 19, 2016, the set and graphics were given another change to reflect Democalypse 2016 and denote \"The Daily Show\"'s RNC and DNC coverage (which was taped in the conventions' respective cities). The new temporary sets had a Washington theme, and was meant to show that Washington is \"a little broke\" and needs \"repair\". Though the studio was reverted to its former self after the election week in 2016, the changes to the graphics were kept.\nSince March 2020, due to the pandemic, the studio has been closed and the show has been filmed from Noah's apartment.\nProduction.\nThe show's writers begin each day with a morning meeting where they review material that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the Associated Press, cable news television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects. By lunchtime, Noah \u2014 who describes his role as that of the captain of a team \u2014 has begun to review headline jokes. The script is submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal. An hour is left for rewrites before a 6 pm taping in front of a live studio audience.\n\"The Daily Show\" typically tapes four new episodes a week, Monday through Thursday, forty-two weeks a year. The show is broadcast at 11 PM Eastern/10 PM Central, a time when local television stations show their news reports and about half an hour before most other late-night comedy programs begin to go on the air. The program is rerun several times the next day, including a 7:30 PM Eastern/6:30 PM Central prime time broadcast.\nHistory.\nCraig Kilborn's tenure (1996\u20131998).\n\"The Daily Show\" was created by Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg and premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, having been marketed as a replacement for \"Politically Incorrect\" (a successful Comedy Central program that had moved to ABC earlier that year). Madeleine Smithberg was co-creator of \"The Daily Show\" as well as the former executive producer. A graduate of Binghamton University, she was an executive producer of \"Steve Harvey's Big Time\" and a talent coordinator for \"Late Night with David Letterman\".\nAiming to parody conventional newscasts, it featured a comedic monologue of the day's headlines from anchor Craig Kilborn (a well-known co-anchor of ESPN's \"SportsCenter\"), as well as mockumentary style on-location reports, in-studio segments and debates from regular correspondents Winstead, Brian Unger, Beth Littleford, and A. Whitney Brown.\nCommon segments.\nCommon segments included \"This Day in Hasselhoff History\" and \"Last Weekend's Top-Grossing Films, Converted into Lira\", in parody of entertainment news shows and their tendency to lead out to commercials with trivia such as celebrity birthdays. Another commercial lead-out featured Winstead's parents, on her answering machine, reading that day's \"Final Jeopardy!\" question and answer. In each show, Kilborn would conduct celebrity interviews, ending with a segment called \"Five Questions\" in which the guest was made to answer a series of questions that were typically a combination of obscure fact and subjective opinion. These are highlighted in a 1998 book titled \"The Daily Show: Five Questions\", which contains transcripts of Kilborn's best interviews. Each episode concluded with a segment called \"Your Moment of Zen\" that showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as visitors at a Chinese zoo feeding baby chickens to the alligators. Originally the show was recorded without a studio audience, featuring only the laughter of its own off-camera staff members. A studio audience was incorporated into the show for its second season, and has remained since.\nDifferences between Kilborn's version and Stewart's version.\nThe show was much less politically focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for \"a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics\". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged by some of the show's cast.[\"by whom?\"] Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, \"You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces.\" One reviewer from \"The New York Times\" criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as \"bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty.\"\nCraig Kilborn's departure.\nThere were reports of backstage friction between Kilborn and some of the female staff, particularly the show's co-creator Lizz Winstead. Winstead had not been involved in the hiring of Kilborn, and disagreed with him over what direction the show should take. \"I spent eight months developing and staffing a show and seeking a tone with producers and writers. Somebody else put him in place. There were bound to be problems. I viewed the show as content-driven; he viewed it as host-driven\", she said. In a 1997 \"Esquire\" magazine interview, Kilborn made a sexually explicit joke about Winstead. Comedy Central responded by suspending Kilborn without pay for one week, and Winstead quit soon after.\nIn 1998, Kilborn left \"The Daily Show\" to replace Tom Snyder on CBS's \"The Late Late Show\" (Now Hosted by James Corden). He claimed the \"Five Questions\" interview segment as intellectual property, disallowing any future \"Daily Show\" hosts from using it in their interviews. Correspondents Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown left the show shortly before him, but the majority of the show's crew and writing staff stayed on. Kilborn's last show as host aired on December 17, 1998, ending a 386-episode tenure. Reruns were shown until Jon Stewart's debut four weeks later. Kilborn made a short appearance on Jon Stewart's final edition of the \"Daily Show\" saying \"I knew you were going to run this thing into the ground.\"\nJon Stewart's tenure (1999\u20132015).\nShift in content.\nJon Stewart \"(right)\" hosting an episode of \"The Daily Show\" in 2010 with Admiral Michael Mullen\nComedian Jon Stewart took over as host of the show, which was retitled \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", on January 11, 1999. Stewart had previously hosted \"Short Attention Span Theater\" on Comedy Central, two shows on MTV (\"You Wrote It, You Watch It\" and The Jon Stewart Show), as well as a syndicated late-night talk show, and had been cast in films and television. In taking over hosting from Kilborn, Stewart initially retained much of the same staff and on-air talent, allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble, while other features like \"God Stuff\", with John Bloom presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists, and \"Backfire\", an in-studio debate between Brian Unger and A. Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of \"This Week in God\" and Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell's \"Even Stevphen\". After the change, a number of new features were developed. The ending segment \"Your Moment of Zen\", previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos, was diversified to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show. The show's theme music, \"Dog on Fire\" by Bob Mould, was re-recorded by They Might Be Giants shortly after Stewart joined the show.\nStewart served not only as host but also as a writer and executive producer of the series. He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of \"The Onion\" Ben Karlin who, along with fellow \"Onion\" contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things \"[started] to take shape\". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, \"The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that you know they don't believe.\"\nLogo used for Stewart's tenure\nUnder Stewart and Karlin \"The Daily Show\" developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Then-correspondent Stephen Colbert recalls that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy. Colbert says that whereas under Kilborn the focus was on \"human interest-y\" pieces, with Stewart as host the show's content became more \"issues and news driven\", particularly after the beginning of the 2000 election campaign with which the show dealt in its \"Indecision 2000\" coverage. Stewart himself describes the show's coverage of the 2000 election recount as the point at which the show found its editorial voice. \"That's when I think we tapped into the emotional angle of the news for us and found our editorial footing,\" he says. Following the September 11th attacks, \"The Daily Show\" went off the air for nine days. Upon its return, Stewart opened the show with a somber monologue, that, according to Jeremy Gillick and Nonna Gorilovskaya, addressed both the absurdity and importance of his role as a comedian. Commented Stewart:They said to get back to work, and there were no jobs available for a man in the fetal position. ...We sit in the back and we throw spitballs \u2013 never forgetting the fact that it is a luxury in this country that allows us to do that. ...The view from my apartment was the World Trade Center. Now it's gone. They attacked it. This symbol of American ingenuity and strength and labor and imagination and commerce and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. The view from the south of Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that.\n\u2014\u2009Gillick and Gorilovskaya point to the September 11 attacks and the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as the point at which Jon Stewart emerged as a trusted national figure. Robert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, recalled of this period, \"When all the news guys were walking on eggshells, Jon was hammering those questions about WMDs.\"\nBroadening the role of the correspondent.\nDuring Stewart's tenure, the role of the correspondent broadened to encompass not only field segments but also frequent in-studio exchanges. Under Kilborn, Colbert says that his work as a correspondent initially involved \"character driven [field] pieces\u2014like, you know, guys who believe in Bigfoot.\" However, as the focus of the show has become more news-driven, correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces, either as experts discussing issues at the anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen. Colbert says that this change has allowed correspondents to be more involved with the show, as it has permitted them to work more closely with the host and writers.\nPopularity and critical respect.\nThe show's 2000 and 2004 election coverage, combined with a new satirical edge, helped to catapult Stewart and \"The Daily Show\" to new levels of popularity and critical respect. Since Stewart became host, the show has won 23 Primetime Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards, and its ratings steadily increased. In 2003, the show was averaging nearly a million viewers, an increase of nearly threefold since the show's inception as Comedy Central became available in more households. By September 2008, the show averaged nearly two million viewers per night. Senator Barack Obama's interview on October 29, 2008, pulled in 3.6 million viewers.\nIn the political spectrum.\nThe move towards greater involvement in political issues and the increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where the views of the show fit in the political spectrum. Adam Clymer, among many others, has argued that \"The Daily Show\" is more critical of Republicans than Democrats. Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election, acknowledged that the show has a more liberal point of view, but that it is not \"a liberal organization\" with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny. He acknowledges that the show is not necessarily an \"equal opportunity offender\", explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because \"I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not.\" In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that \"The Daily Show\" is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert, also a self-proclaimed Democrat, said in an interview during the Bush Administration, when the Republicans held a majority in the House and Senate: \"We are liberal, but Jon's very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power it would be easier to attack them, but Republicans have the executive, legislative and judicial branches, so making fun of Democrats is like kicking a child, so it's just not worth it.\"\nStewart is critical of Democratic politicians for being weak, timid, or ineffective. He said in an interview with Larry King, prior to the 2006 elections, \"I honestly don't feel that [the Democrats] make an impact. They have forty-nine percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At a certain point you go, 'Guys, pick up your game.'\" He has targeted them for failing to effectively stand on some issues, such as the war in Iraq, describing them as \"incompetent\" and \"unable... to locate their asses, even when presented with two hands and a special ass map.\"\nKarlin, then the show's executive producer, said in a 2004 interview that while there is a collective sensibility among the staff which, \"when filtered through Jon and the correspondents, feels uniform,\" the principal goal of the show is comedy. \"If you have a legitimately funny joke in support of the notion that gay people are an affront to God, we'll put that motherfucker on!\"\nOn September 15, 2003, Senator John Edwards became the first candidate to announce that they were running for president on the show, causing Jon Stewart to jokingly inform him that their show was \"fake\" and he might have to reannounce elsewhere. On November 17, 2009, Vice President Joe Biden appeared on the show, making him the first sitting vice president to do so. On October 27, 2010, President Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to be interviewed on the show, wherein Obama commented he \"loved\" the show. Obama took issue with Stewart's suggestion that his health care program was \"timid.\"\nAfter the United States Senate failed to pass and the media failed to cover the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide health monitoring and financial aid to sick first responders of the September 11 attacks, Stewart dedicated the entire December 16, 2010, broadcast to the issue. During the next week, a revived version of the bill gained new life, with the potential of being passed before the winter recess. Stewart was praised by both politicians and affected first responders for the bill's passage. According to Syracuse University professor of television, radio and film Robert J. Thompson, \"Without him, it's unlikely it would've passed. I don't think Brian Williams, Katie Couric or Diane Sawyer would've been allowed to do this.\"\nWriters' strike.\nDue to the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike, the show went on hiatus on November 5, 2007. Although the strike continued until February 2008, the show returned to air on January 7, 2008, without its staff of writers. In solidarity with the writers, the show was referred to as A Daily Show with Jon Stewart rather than \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\" until the end of the strike. As a member of the Writers Guild of America, Stewart was barred from writing any material for the show himself which he or his writers would ordinarily write. As a result, Stewart and the correspondents largely ad-libbed the show around planned topics.\nIn an effort to fill time while keeping to the strike-related restrictions, the show aired or re-aired some previously recorded segments, and Stewart engaged in a briefly recurring mock feud with fellow late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and Conan O'Brien. The strike officially ended on February 12, 2008, with the show's writers returning to work the following day, at which point the title of \"The Daily Show\" was restored.\nStewart's absence in 2013.\nStarting in June 2013, Jon Stewart took a twelve-week break to direct \"Rosewater\", a drama about a journalist jailed by Iran for four months. Show writer John Oliver replaced Stewart at the anchor desk for two months, to be followed by one month of reruns. Oliver received positive reviews for his hosting, leading to his departure from the show in December 2013 for his own show \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\", which debuted April 27, 2014, on HBO.\nJon Stewart's departure.\nBarack Obama made his final appearance on the show with Jon Stewart as host on July 21, 2015\nOn February 10, 2015, Stewart announced that he would be leaving the show later in the year. Comedy Central indicated in a statement that \"The Daily Show\" would continue without Stewart, saying it would \"endure for years to come\".\nOn June 25, 2015, Comedy Central announced that to lead up to Stewart's final episode, it would hold \"Your Month of Zen\"\u2014an online marathon streaming every episode of Stewart's tenure from June 26 to August 6, 2015.\nOn August 5, 2015, Stewart's longtime friend of 30 years comedian Louis C.K. was selected to be the last guest before the final Daily Show episode with Stewart helming the show. C.K. joked that he was there \"representing comedy to say good job\".\nOn August 6, 2015, Stewart's final episode aired as an hour-long special in three segments. The first featured a reunion of a majority of the correspondents and contributors from throughout the show's history as well as a pre-recorded \"anti-tribute\" (mocking Stewart) from various frequent guests and \"friends\" of the show. This included Bill O'Reilly, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie, John Kerry, and Chuck Schumer.\nThe second segment featured a pre-recorded tour of the Daily Show production facility and studio introducing all of the show's staff and crew. The final segment featured a short farewell speech from Stewart followed by the final \"Moment of Zen\" (being 'his own' moment of zen): a performance of \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" and \"Born to Run\" by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.\nTrevor Noah's tenure (2015\u2013present).\nOn March 30, 2015, it was announced that Trevor Noah would replace Stewart as host of \"The Daily Show\". Shortly after his announcement, it was revealed that Amy Schumer, Louis C.K., Amy Poehler, and Chris Rock were all considered for the job. His first show was on September 28, 2015, with comedian Kevin Hart as his first guest. Noah's premiere episode was simulcast by Viacom on Comedy Central, the Nick at Nite block on Nickelodeon, Spike, MTV, MTV2, mtvU, VH1, VH1 Classic, BET, Centric, CMT, TV Land and Logo TV.\nOn September 14, 2017, it was announced that Comedy Central had extended Trevor Noah's contract as host of \"The Daily Show\" for five years, through 2022.\nRatings declined by about 37 percent at the start of Noah's tenure, and have gradually increased since then, only to once again fall down to the lowest ratings in 15 years in 2020.\nDifferences between Stewart's version and Noah's version.\nIn addition to changes in the tone of the show,[\"clarification needed\"] Noah has also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set, new graphics and his monologue sometimes taking place while standing in front of a screen as opposed to sitting at the desk. Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial-based references, impersonations and characterizations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.\nThe debut of \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\" brought along three new correspondents: Roy Wood Jr., Desi Lydic and Ronny Chieng.\nAdditional correspondents were added in 2017. Michael Kosta became the Senior Constitutional Correspondent and Senior American Correspondent on July 11, 2017. Dulc\u00e9 Sloan became the Senior Fashion Correspondent on September 7, 2017.\nIn January 2016, \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\" started to use a modified version of the show's previous theme, remixed by Timbaland and King Logan.\nNoah also avoided talking too much about Fox News, as Stewart was previously known for. \"\"The Daily Show\" was based on an emerging 24 hour news cycle, that\u2019s everything it was, that\u2019s what inspired \"The Daily Show\". Now you look at news and it\u2019s changed. It\u2019s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you\u2019ve got the Gawkers, the Buzzfeeds. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge is going to be an exciting one I'm sure is how are we going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source\u2014which was historically Fox News,\" Noah said at a press conference before the show's debut.\nStewart visits \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\"; Jordan Klepper guest hosts.\nOn December 8, 2015, former host Jon Stewart returned to \"The Daily Show\" for the first time in an extended-length show to return attention to extending the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, otherwise referred to as 9/11 First Responders Bill, which Stewart explained had been blocked by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell for political reasons. On October 20, 2016, Noah was unable to host a scheduled taping of \"The Daily Show\" due to illness, so correspondent Jordan Klepper guest hosted.\nOn November 16, 2017, Stewart once again returned to \"The Daily Show\", in part as a parody of the robocalls of fake \"Washington Post\" reporter \"Bernie Bernstein\" and to promote \"Night of Too Many Stars\" on HBO.\n\"The Daily Social Distancing Show\".\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, it was initially announced that starting March 16, 2020, the show would do away with the live audience, like all other live shows were starting to do. However, that day, Noah posted a short video explaining that they would not do that because of social distancing. On March 18, 2020, Noah did a modified version of \"The Daily Show\" from his own home for Comedy Central's website and \"The Daily Show\"'s YouTube channel called \"The Daily Social Distancing Show with Trevor Noah\". On March 21, 2020, it was announced that this format would be moving to linear television beginning March 23, 2020. The Daily Show won the 2020 Webby Award for Humor in the category Social.\nOn June 15, 2021, it was announced that \"The Daily Social Distancing Show\" would go on a three-month hiatus beginning after the episode airing on June 17. According to a press release, it will resume on September 13 with a \"brand-new look\", but gave no other information beyond that, or any indication if the show would be returning to the studio.\nExpansion to 45-minute format.\nFollowing the cancellation of \"Lights Out with David Spade, The Daily Show\" expanded into a 45-minute format beginning April 27, 2020. In July 2020, Comedy Central head Chris McCarthy told \"Vulture\" that there were plans to possibly extend the show to an hour-long format by the end of the year.\nCorrespondents, contributors and staff.\nMain articles: List of The Daily Show correspondents and List of The Daily Show writers\nThe show's correspondents have two principal roles: experts with satirical senior titles that Noah interviews about certain issues, or hosts of field reporting segments which often involve humorous commentary and interviews relating to a current issue. The current team of correspondents collectively known as \"The World's Fakest News Team\" (formerly known as \"The Best F#@king News Team Ever\") includes Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, Desi Lydic, Dulc\u00e9 Sloan, Roy Wood Jr. and Jaboukie Young-White. Contributors appear on a less frequent basis, often with their own unique recurring segment or topic. Current contributors are Lewis Black, Neal Brennan, and Gina Yashere. Ben Karlin says that the on-air talent contribute in many ways to the material they perform, playing an integral role in the creation of their field pieces as well as being involved with their scripted studio segments, either taking part early on in the writing process or adding improvised material during the rehearsal.\nThe show has featured a number of well-known comedians throughout its run and is notable for boosting the careers of several of these. Scott Dikkers, editor-in-chief of \"The Onion\", describes it as a key launching pad for comedic talent, saying that \"I don't know if there's a better show you could put on your resume right now.\" Steve Carell, who was a correspondent between 1999 and 2005 before moving on to a movie career and starring television role in \"The Office\", credits Stewart and \"The Daily Show\" with his success. In 2005, the show's longest-serving correspondent, Stephen Colbert, became the host of the spin-off \"The Colbert Report\", earning critical and popular acclaim. Colbert would host the program until he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of CBS's \"Late Show\" in 2015. Ed Helms, a former correspondent from 2002 to 2006, also starred on NBC's \"The Office\" and was a main character in the 2009 hit \"The Hangover\".\nAfter filling in as host during Stewart's two-month absence in the summer of 2013, John Oliver went on to host his own show on HBO, \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\". In 2016, former correspondent Samantha Bee launched her own late-night talk show \"Full Frontal with Samantha Bee\". Bee's husband Jason Jones, also a former correspondent, serves as executive producer for the show. Hasan Minhaj, the last correspondent hired during Stewart's tenure as host, left the show in 2018 to host \"Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj\" on Netflix.\nIn June 2010, actress-comedian Olivia Munn began a tryout period on the show as a correspondent. Her credentials were questioned by Irin Carmon of the website Jezebel, who suggested that Munn was better known as a sex symbol than as a comedian. Carmon's column was denounced by Munn and the \"Daily Show\"'s female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a rebuttal on the show's website in which they asserted that the description of the \"Daily Show\" office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate. Munn appeared as a \"Daily Show\" correspondent in a total of 16 episodes, from June 2010 to September 2011.\nWyatt Cenac had a tumultuous tenure on the show, revealing in a July 2015 interview on \"WTF with Marc Maron\", that his departure stemmed in part from a heated argument he had with Jon Stewart in June 2011 over a bit about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. However, Cenac did return for Stewart's final episode to bid him farewell and the two exchanged an intentionally awkward conversation."}

{"id": "138503", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138503", "title": "Dalek", "text": "The Daleks are a made-up alien race of mutants from the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". Daleks are aliens from the planet Skaro, integrated within a tank-like metal casing. The creatures are a powerful race who always wanted universal conquest and control, they have no pity, feelings or guilt (as all of their emotions were removed except hate).\nThe Daleks are one of the most powerful races ever in \"Doctor Who\" history and are the Doctor's worst enemies. They cry \"EX-TER-MIN-ATE!\" when they are about to kill someone. They come in different colours, like bronze, black, red, white, gold, and silver. They first appeared in the first season episode of the series (in \"The Daleks\") and they were last seen in the Series 7 episode \"Asylum of the Daleks\" (2012). They are not robots, but horrible aliens kept in a metal casing, because they became mutated during a war on their planet, Skaro. They were created by an evil scientist named Davros. They can not be easily hurt by guns as their casing reflects the bullets that come from the gun and a shield melts bullets shot at them.\nDaleks were created by writer Terry Nation and designed by BBC designer Raymond Cusick. They were introduced in December 1963 in the second \"Doctor Who\" serial. From their first appearance they became very popular with viewers. They appeared in many later serials and two 1960s motion pictures.\nThe word \"Dalek\" has been put into the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and other major dictionaries; the \"Collins Dictionary\" defines it rather broadly as \"any of a set of fictional robot-like creations that are aggressive, mobile, and produce rasping staccato speech\". Although there is no meaning to their name, \"Dalek\" sounds like the Norwegian word \"d\u00e5rlig\", which means \"bad\" or \"evil\". It is also a trademark, having first been registered by the BBC in 1964 to protect its range of Dalek merchandise.\nThe Daleks were on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by Lord Snowdon.\nPhysical characteristics.\nOn the outside, Daleks resemble human-sized salt and pepper shakers who are five to six feet (152 to 183\u00a0cm) tall. On the top, they have a rotating dome with a telescope for seeing. They have two arms. One arm has an energy weapon (or \"death ray\"), which looks like an long egg beater or the framework of a paint roller. In some episodes, this could also fire a gas or projectiles. Their other arm is a telescope with a plunger on the end, which they use as a hand. The actual Dalek creature inside the metal casing is very rarely seen. It looks like an octopus or a squid.\nMovement.\nEarly versions of the Daleks were rolled around on castors or moved by wheels connected to hand cranks by bicycle chains.\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels (from shopping carts, according to a Blue Peter episode) and were simply moved by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of where the camera could not see. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky movements of the Dalek. The latest model of the costume still has a human operator within, but the movement of the dome and eyestalk are now remotely controlled so that the operator can concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.\nFictional history.\nThe Daleks have appeared on the show many times and their design has seen many changes. This means that it can be difficult to make sure that the storylines line up. When the Daleks first appeared in \"The Daleks\", they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races. However, in 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in \"Genesis of the Daleks\", where the Dals were now called Kaleds (of which Daleks is an anagram), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist Davros.\nInstead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war, fought with nuclear and other weapons causing widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in \"travel machines\" whose design was based on his own life-support chair.\n\"Genesis of the Daleks\" marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely talked about again.\nA single Dalek appeared in \"Dalek\", written by Robert Shearman, which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the last Time War that had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.The Doctor had guessed that this Dalek had \"fallen\" out of the time war.\nThe Dalek Emperor returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with human subjects; it saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. This terrified the Doctor as \"Daleks have no concept of blasphemy.\" These Daleks and their fleet were erased from time itself in \"The Parting of the Ways\".\nThe 2006 series finale \"Army of Ghosts\"/\"Doomsday\" saw another squad of Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the Cult of Skaro, led by a black Dalek named \"Dalek Sec\", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged, along with a Time Lord prison containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the Torchwood Institute and Cybermen from a parallel world, leading to a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London. Eventually, the Tenth Doctor caused both factions to be sucked back into the Void. However, the Cult members (Sec, Caan, Jast, and Thay; it is unusual for a Dalek to have a name) survived by \"temporal shifting\" away. The two-part story \"Daleks in Manhattan\"/\"Evolution of the Daleks\" revealed they had escaped to 1930 New York, setting up base in the Empire State Building, which was being built at the time. Experiments led by Sec attepted to force a Dalek evolution by combining their DNA with that of humans, and he is the first of the new \"Human-Daleks\". However the three remaining Daleks rebelled and destroyed him because he was not a pure dalek. The Cult also attempted to create a Human/Dalek hybrid (fully human in appearance but with Dalek minds). This attempt failed after the Doctor interfered. Caan escaped via another temporal shift.\nThe Daleks returned in the 2008 series' two-part finale, \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\", accompanied once again by their creator Davros (now played by Julian Bleach). It is revealved that Dalek Caan had forced himself back into the Time War, even though it was \"time-locked\" or prevented from entering by any means (the effort rendered him insane), where he rescued Davros; Davros then created a new army of Daleks from his own flesh. The new Dalek army was led by a Supreme Dalek, who kept Davros imprisoned in a \"Vault\"; Davros said that he and the Supreme Dalek had reached \"an arrangement\". Davros and the Daleks planned to destroy all creation with a 'reality bomb', which failed due to the interference of the Doctor and his companions, and due to Caan himself who had been manipulating the events unknown to either side. Though the Daleks were destroyed, the fate of Davros and Dalek Caan is unknown. 3 Daleks from this episode came back in Series 5 (Victory of the Daleks). They created 5 new, different colored daleks. These new Daleks escaped into space. Later, they showed up in \"The Pandorica Opens\" and trapped the Doctor in the Pandorica, the ultimate prison. After they were erased from time by the cracks, a stone Dalek showed up, which was an echo of the Dalek race. It was brought alive by the Pandorica light, which could restore thing which had been erased by the cracks. It was later shot in the eye by River Song. Their race, along with the rest of the universe, was brought back by the Doctor."}

Its prefecture is Rodez.\nHistory.\nAveyron is one of the 83 French departments made during the French revolution, on 4 March 1790.

They can vibrate when air passes through the larynx. This produces sounds. Humans use them to produce language.\nMen and women have different vocal fold sizes. Adult male voices are usually deeper: males have thicker cord. The male vocal folds are between 17\u00a0mm and 25\u00a0mm in length.\"\"\nThe female vocal folds are between 12.5\u00a0mm and 17.5\u00a0mm long.\nThe difference in vocal fold size between men and women means that their voices have a different pitch. Each person's voice is different and has a slightly different pitch. This is caused by genes that influence how the larynx is made.\nFalse vocal cords.\nThe vocal cords are sometimes called 'true vocal cords' to distinguish them from the false vocal cords. These are a pair of thick folds of mucous membrane. They sit directly above the true vocal folds, to protect them. They have a very small role in normal speech , but are often used in musical screaming and the death grunt singing style. They are also used in Tuvan throat singing.\nThe false cords are also called vestibular folds and ventricular folds. They can be seen on the diagram above as \"ventricular folds\".\nUnlike the true vocal cords, the false ones grow back completely when they are removed by surgery."}

The word \"embedded\" means it is built into the system. It is a permanent part in a bigger system. It usually does not look like a computer, often no keyboard or monitor or mouse. But like any computer it has a processor, software, input and output. \nFor example, the controller embedded in an elevator tells the motor to move the elevator to different floors, based on buttons that are pushed. A decoder is embedded in a satellite television set-top box (called STB) to read a signal from the dish and send something that a TV understands. Often this type of system must do its work in a specific amount of time. This is called real-time computing. If a set-top box got interrupted to do another task, you would see a bad picture on the TV, for example. A general purpose computer will often have short pauses while it does something else, it is not real-time.\nEmbedded systems control many of the common devices in use today, such as card readers in hotel door locks or several things in a car. They can control small things like an MP3 player or a digital camera, and large things like traffic light systems, airplanes, or assembly lines in a factory.\nExamples of embedded systems.\nEmbedded systems are used in many kinds of electrical devices, including:\nCommon features.\nEmbedded systems are not always standalone devices. Sometimes they are built as a set, like the various parts of a car - the radio, the throttle control, the pollution control, etc. Sometimes they can communicate to the internet or a cell-phone network and they may have a USB reader or other connections.\nUser interfaces.\nEmbedded systems range from no user interface at all \u2014 only sending and receiving electric signals \u2014 to a full graphical user interface like on a modern computer. Quite often they will have a few push-buttons and a small display and some LEDs. A more complex system may have a touch screen, allowing the meaning of the buttons to change with each screen as in smart phones.\nHardware.\nHardware includes the chips, wires, circuit boards, buttons and displays.\nCPUs.\nThe most important chip is the central processing unit or CPU. This runs the software instructions. It can be a standard microprocessor or a microcontroller. Microcontrollers include the microprocessor as well as simple peripheral equipment so the system can be smaller and cheaper. They have less flexibility because those parts cannot be changed. Usually these parts include Flash memory and support for serial ports, USB, etc.\nUnlike a microprocessor for a general-purpose computer, bigger and faster is not always better. Many embedded processors are very small. Sometimes this is to use less space or less power, sometimes it is to be cheaper. General-purpose computers will use microprocessors that read 32-bit or 64-bit words and run at speeds measured in GHz, but embedded processors are usually 4 to 32 bits and run at speeds usually measured in tens of MHz (a hundred times slower). (But the programs are also smaller and do not check for things that are not used).\nReady made computer boards.\nThere are \"ready-made\" computer boards that can be used in some embedded systems. These often use Windows CE, Linux, NetBSD, or an embedded real-time operating system.\nSometimes it may be easier to use a circuit board that is already made. These usually share many components with general purpose computers, but are smaller than one in a general purpose computer. Boards such as the VIA EPIA can run Microsoft Windows. The advantage is that it saves some electrical engineering time and can use the same software development tools used for PC-type software development. Examples of such embedded devices are the ATMs or displays in casinos. This works well if the real-time requirements are not real strict (it doesn't matter much if a job takes eight seconds instead of five, for example).\nASIC and FPGA solutions.\nIf the device needs to be very small or will be sold in very big numbers (\"high-volume\"), it makes sense to make a custom or specialized chip that does exactly what is needed. This is a system on a chip (SoC) which holds a complete system - processor, floating point unit, memory cache and interfaces on a single integrated circuit. SoCs can be made as a special-order application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or by using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) which is programmed by the people building the embedded system.\nPeripherals.\nEmbedded systems talk with the outside world or other components using peripherals such as:\nSoftware.\nOperating systems.\nEmbedded systems often do not need a full operating system. Some use specially-built small and simple operating systems that start very quickly, others do not need one at all. Embedded systems are not adapted as easily, but they are built to perform their tasks much more reliably. Because the hardware is simpler, it is also often cheaper to build and runs faster.\nIn contrast to this, a general-purpose computer needs to be ready for new device drivers and software to run hardware it doesn't know about yet, like new printers or hard drives. It needs to run different application programs.\nAs embedded systems get bigger, things that used to be only on general-purpose computers or even mainframes are now becoming common on embedded systems. This includes protected memory space, and open programming environment including Linux, NetBSD, etc.\nSome examples of operating systems, from simple to complex:\nReal-time operating systems include products like MicroC/OS-II, Green Hills INTEGRITY, QNX or VxWorks. Unlike MacOS or Windows 7, these operating systems are not known very well by most people. But they are used in many places where time and safety is very important. People use them every day and do not realize it.\nCommon examples of larger kernels are Embedded Linux and Windows CE. Although these do not have the tight time limits needed for a strict real-time system, they are becoming more common, especially for more powerful devices such as Wireless Routers and GPSs. They allow re-use of code in the public domain for Device Drivers, Web Servers, Firewalls, and other code. Software developers that are more comfortable writing applications for PCs will find this more familiar as well. If needed, an FPGA or other special hardware can be used for things that do need tight time limits.\nTools.\nLike other software, embedded system designers use compilers, assemblers, and debuggers to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:\nDebugging tools:\nUnless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as assembly code or source-code. Some integrated systems (like VxWorks or Green Hills) have special features, like keeping track of how much space the software takes as it runs, what tasks are running, and when things happen.\nDepending on what kind of embedded system is being made will affect how it can be debugged. For instance, debugging a single microprocessor system is different from debugging a system where processing is also done on a peripheral (DSP, FPGA, co-processor).\nSafety and Reliability.\nEmbedded systems are often in machines that are expected to run for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. This means the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives and fans are avoided.\nPlaces where safety and reliability are important: \nWays to recover from errors \u2014 both software bugs such as memory leaks, and also soft errors in the hardware:"}

Airbags are bags that rapidly fill with air when an accident happens. That way they can prevent injuries that occur when the driver hits a hard object.\nAn airbag is a useful vehicle safety device. Airbags are used in the world increasingly because in accidents, it can help passengers reduce shock. \nWhen the sensor feels a strong shock, the gas device explodes. This gas fills the bag immediately.\nHistory of airbags.\nAn American inventor, Dr. Allen S. Breed, invented and developed a key component for automotive use. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation first in 1967 to Chrysler. A similar \"Auto-Ceptor\" crash-restraint, brandon, developed by Eaton, Yale &amp; Towne Inc. for Ford was soon offered as an automatic safety system in the USA. The Italian Eaton-Livia company offered a variant with localized air cushions.\nAll cars used the airbag nowadays was originally invented by a Japanese man Mr. Kobori and he took the world patents.\nThe first patent on an inflatable crash-landing device for airplanes was filed during World War II. In 1973, the first commercial airbags appeared in a run of 1,000 Chevrolet Impalas. Since model year 1998, all new cars sold in the United States have been required to have airbags on both driver and passenger sides. To date, statistics show that airbags reduce the risk of dying in a direct frontal crash by about 30 percent. Today, some cars have six or even eight airbags.\nHow airbags work.\nFirst, moving objects have momentum (the product of the mass and the velocity of an object). If no outside force acts on an object, the object will continue to move at its present speed and direction (because of inertia). Cars consist of several objects, including the vehicle itself, loose objects in the car and, of course, passengers. If these objects are not restrained, they will continue moving at whatever speed the car is travelling at, even if the car is stopped by a collision. \nStopping an object's momentum requires force acting over a period of time. When a car crashes, the force required to stop an object is very great because the car's momentum has changed instantly while the passengers' has not (there is not much time to work with). The goal of any supplemental restraint system is to help stop the passenger while doing as little damage to them as possible. \nWhat an airbag wants to do is to slow the passenger's speed to zero with little or no damage. The constraints that it has to work within are huge. The airbag has the space between the passenger and the steering wheel or dashboard and a fraction of a second to work with. Even that tiny amount of space and time is valuable, however, if the system can slow the passenger evenly rather than forcing an abrupt halt to their motion.\nMotorcycle airbag.\nIn 2006 the airbag was set up for a motorcycle. This was in the Gold Wing by Honda.\nThe second airbag device for motorcyclist is an inflatable airbag jacket was invented by Tam\u00e1s Straub in 1976."}

It used to be the site for steelworks. Ravenscraig used to have the largest steel mill in Western Europe. Ravenscraig was closed in 1992, and is now almost completely gone.\nRavenscraig is now at the start of a big redevelopment by Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd, Scottish Enterprise and Corus, to create a full new town.\nLocation.\nRavenscraig is very easy to get to. More than two\u2014thirds of Scotland\u2019s population live within 90 minutes drive.\nLocated in North Lanarkshire, Ravenscraig is between the towns of Wishaw and Motherwell, who house a population of over 60,000.\nRavenscraig lies only a few minutes drive from both the M74 and the M8 motorways which lead to Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland's two biggest cities.\nHistory.\nAnother steel maker, Colvilles, decided to expand their business in July 1954. They were the largest steel manufacturer before World War II.\nIn 1954, Colvilles began the first stages of development in Ravenscraig, that turned Ravenscraig from an empty field into a site for steelworks. By 1957 most of the machinery was built and by 1959 the full building work was complete.\nWhen Ravenscraig closed in 1993, that was the end of most steel making in Scotland. 770 jobs were lost, along with another 10,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly linked.\nCurrent State.\nIn its current state, Ravenscraig is one of the largest derelict sites in Europe measuring over 1125 acres in size. Ravenscraig is the same size as an area of 700 football pitches and double the size of Monaco.\nFuture Plans.\nAfter many years of planning, Ravenscraig will be rebuilt by three equal companies: Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd, Scottish Enterprise and Corus and will be one of the largest regenerations in Europe, with 400 acres being developed.\nRavenscraig will have lots of new facilities:\nPart of the development will be to make new habitats for the wildlife that live in the area, such as deer, foxes, hares, otters, badgers, watervoles, butterflies and many birds. An \"Ecological Clerk of Works\" has been appointed to make sure the building works do not harm the wildlife.\nIt is hoped that the \u00a329million sports complex will be used as a training camp for the 2012 London Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\nThere are many people who disagree with the building work. Many local residents and small businesses think that it will take jobs and customers from other towns.\nTransport.\nAs part of the changes, the transport to Ravenscraig will get better. There will be new transport within walking distance of the new town centre, with buses going to Glasgow, Lanark and many other towns. There will be easy access to public transport throughout Ravenscraig that will include business routes, that will link to the public transport network with roads to the Motherwell and Carfin rail stations.\nMotherwell FC.\nLocal press have said that the Scottish Premier League football team, Motherwell Football Club could buy some land in Ravenscraig to build a new football stadium, leaving behind their home of 113 years, Fir Park. Motherwell Chairman, John Boyle has said \"No decisions have been taken and we are simply exploring realistic options at this stage.\""}

The aim of the game is to respond quickly to the directions that come out of the game's speakers. These directions are given in a way that requires the player do use different devices on the machine, such as pull handles, twist cranks, spin wheels, or toggle switches. A beat is played during the game and the beat will get faster as the player scores more points, making it harder for the player to respond.\n\"Bop It\" can be played by one to four people at a time and has been very popular as a children's game. It was designed by Dan Klistner and developed by other Hasbro designers, including Bob Welch. The original version was released in 1996, and there have been several versions made since then. The current classic version was released in 2016 to mark the 20th anniversary of the original game. It was demonstrated at the New York Toy Fair in 2016 before the game was released in June 2016. It is called \"Bop It! New Moves\".\nSince 2008, the voice in the games has been Buddy Rubino. He has recorded the voice for \"Bop It!\", \"Bop It! XT\", \"Bop It! Smash!, Bop It! Tetris and Bop It! New Moves.\"\n\"Zing It\".\n\"Zing It\" is a yo-yo version of \"Bop It\". It tells commands that the player must follow along with. Like the original \"Bop It\", there are three commands that may be said: \"Bop it!\" (requiring the player to press the purple button), \"Zing it!\" (requiring the player to drop the yo-yo downward and send it back up again), and \"Loop it!\" (requiring the player to do the \"'round the world\" yo-yo trick). \"Zing It\" has 3 modes: \"Vox Bop\" (as with Bop It), \"Beat Bop\" (again, as with Bop It), and \"Vox Bop Challenge\" (where the game will tell a series of commands which must be done in correctly). As with \"Bop It\" and \"Bop It Extreme\", \"Zing It\" announces the score musically by sound effects. Different tones represent different point values. There is a maximum score of 250.\nVideo games.\nIn 2009, EA Games made a video game called \"Hasbro Family Games Night 2\". It had \"Bop It\" as one of the games that could be played. It is available for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii. In 2011, EA Games made an iPhone application which played exactly like the handheld game. It has the same commands from the handheld games and added extra commands which were never invented on the handheld game."}

It is sometimes called embedded software. An example is a microcontroller, a part of the microprocessor that tells the microprocessor what actions to take. It can also be a larger program stored on flash memory, or uploaded onto existing hardware by a user.\nAs its name suggests, firmware is somewhere between hardware and software, connecting the two worlds. It can mean slightly different things to different people, especially as stand-alone electronic devices become more like computers. Like software, it is a computer program which is run by a microprocessor. But it is also linked to a piece of hardware and has no meaning without it.\nOn a Computer.\nA computer can have both firmware and software. The firmware is permanently stored in the computer, such as the BIOS, and cannot be easily changed or added to. Software, even the OS, can be replaced by reformatting the hard drive. Software includes the applications that a person operating a computer sees, like a web browser or a word processor. Sometimes a device driver is called firmware, since it is needed to run that piece of hardware, like a printer or a video card. The device driver is on the main part of the computer and can be easily updated (if an update exists).\nOn an Electronic Device.\nOther electronic devices may not look like a computer, but they still have an embedded system such as a microcontroller inside, with a program telling them what to do. This is also firmware. A TV cable box, an elevator controller and a card reader in a hotel door lock all run firmware. In this case, the firmware is the only software on the device and it runs everything, from handling button presses to turning motors on or off.\nIn the past, firmware was stored in ROMs but now it is often stored in media that can be written to such as EEPROMs and Flash. Firmware in many machines such as routers can now be updated without any special hardware, other than a computer and a USB cable. This is done by downloading a new version from the World Wide Web to update the device, using instructions from the device manufacturer.\nAn electronic device is said to be \"bricked\" if it cannot be started because of firmware issues. It is then as useful as a brick. Loading the wrong firmware into a device might cause this. Firmware is stored as a binary image file.\nExamples.\nExamples of firmware include:"}

A weather system became still in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in early August. An area of low pressure formed along the shear line early on August 2, which slowly became stronger during the next day. It strengthened into Tropical Depression Five, and was named Tropical Storm Edouard on August 3. The tropical storm moved towards the west on August 4. It moved onto land on August 5 on the upper Texas coast, about 40\u00a0miles southwest of Port Arthur and moved west-northwest into inland Texas. Edouard died out over land and became a tropical depression late on August 5. The depression turned to the northwest, causing heavy rain in central Texas on August 6.\nPreparations and impact.\nIn preparations for the storm, emergency teams along the Louisiana and Texas coasts became active. The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, started a disaster declaration for 17 counties in Texas that were in the possible path of the storm. He also activated around 1,200 National Guard troops, a 70\u00a0member rescue team, six helicopters, and a team that brings food and water to affected areas. About 200\u00a0buses became ready for use in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana, the Office of Emergency Preparedness started a mandatory evacuation, and Sheriff's deputies put up roadblocks. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Shell Oil company removed about 40\u00a0workers from drilling locations. \nStorm surge from the storm reached at Freshwater Locks in Louisiana, and also reached at Rollover Pass in Texas. Heavy rain fell along the upper Texas coast. The highest rainfall in Jefferson county from Edouard was from a site along the East Bay Bayou at Jones and Allen.

Her first album \"Let Go\" was credited as the biggest pop debut of 2002, and certified seven-times Platinum in the United States. Avril is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s.\nEarly life.\nAvril grew up in Ontario, Canada. At the age of 14, she began writing her own music and performing at country fairs. Her first song \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\" was about a teenage crush, which she described as \"cheesy cute\". By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with Shania Twain, and by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records worth more than $2 million.\nMusic career.\n2002\u20132003: Let Go.\nIn June 2002, Avril Lavigne began with the release of her first album \"Let Go,\" and a music video for the debut single \"Complicated\". In the US, it reached number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. At 17 years old, Avril was the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the UK Albums Chart at that time. She was nominated for five Grammy Awards. \"Complicated, Sk8r Boi,\" and \"I'm With You\" were all number one songs on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Top 40.\n2004\u20132005: Under My Skin.\n\"Under My Skin\", was released on May 2004. The album debuted at number one in Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, UK, and U.S. The singles from the album were \"Don't Tell Me, My Happy Ending, Nobody's Home, and He Wasn't\". Avril was awarded for \"World's Best Pop/Rock Artist\" and \"World's Bestselling Canadian Artist\" at the 2004 World Music Awards. She received five Juno Award nominations in 2005 of which she won three, including \"Artist of the Year\".\n\"2006\u20132008: The Best Damn Thing\".\n\"The Best Damn Thing\" was released In April 2007. \"Girlfriend\", the first single from the album became Lavigne's first number-one single on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was one of the decade's biggest singles. The album was the first to carry a parental advisory warning due to repeated use of swear words. Avril described the album as \"fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, confident, cocky in a playful way ... all the good stuff\". The albums second single was \"When You're Gone\". Avril won two World Music Awards in 2007, for \"World's Bestselling Canadian Artist\" and \"World's Best Pop/Rock Female Artist\".\n\"2009\u20132011: Goodbye Lullaby\".\n\"Goodbye Lullaby\" was released on March 2011 in the US. Avril said that the album as being about her life experiences rather than focusing on relationships and that it was easy for her to do a \"boy-bashing pop song,\" but it was different to write about something \"that's really close to me, something I've been through.\" Other than the album's lead single, \"What the Hell\", Avril described the songs on \"Goodbye Lullaby\" as different from her earlier songs. She said her music on this album was less pop rock than her previous material.\n\"2012\u20132015: Avril Lavigne\".\nAvril's fifth studio album \"Avril Lavigne was released on November 2013\".

{"id": "138804", "revid": "628332", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138804", "title": "Hannibal Lecter", "text": "Doctor Hannibal Lecter is a fictional serial killer. He is a character in books by the crime drama writer Thomas Harris. Several of these books have been made into movies. Lecter was also the main character in an NBC television show called \"Hannibal\". \nLecter himself.\nLecter is a cannibal, meaning that he eats people. He is also highly intelligent, so that he can talk to people in a way that makes them afraid or disturbed. He employs this unusual technique most famously in \"The Silence of the Lambs\", a novel featuring him that was made into a movie starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. The movie became very popular, and won many awards.\nLecter is Lithuanian. He is cultured, and his reasons for killing people are often that he thinks they are annoying, rude or corrupt. He is a psychopath, a predator who does not feel empathy. Thus, he feels no guilt about his actions.\nHistory of the character.\n\"Red Dragon\".\nThomas Harris first wrote about Lecter in his novel Red Dragon, which shows how Hannibal Lecter was caught by the FBI, and ends up using his intelligence to help the agent who caught him catch another killer named Francis Dolarhyde. Will Graham, the agent who caught Lecter, is at first very offended by Lecter's demeanor, but comes to appreciate his help when Lecter gives him insight into the way Dolarhyde's mind works. Dolarhyde believes that he is a god, and that he is unaffected by laws and rules. \nTwo movies were based on this book. \"Manhunter\" (1986) starred Tom Noonan as Dolarhyde and Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecktor. In \"Red Dragon\" (2002), Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter and Ralph Fiennes played Dolarhyde.\n\"Silence of the Lambs\".\nLecter returned in \"The Silence of the Lambs\", the sequel to Red Dragon. The movie based on this book became very popular. The book is about an FBI agent named Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster in the movie), who, like Will Graham from Red Dragon, is trying to catch a serial killer, who calls himself \"Buffalo Bill\" because he skins his victims like buffalo. Starling makes a deal with Lecter in which she will try to get him transferred to another prison (Lecter hates his cell) if he will help her understand Buffalo Bill's mind. In the end, Starling catches Bill, but Lecter escapes from prison, fleeing to Africa.\n\"Hannibal\".\nHarris' next novel was \"Hannibal\". It was a sequel to \"Silence of the Lambs\". The book told the story about what happened to Hannibal Lecter after he escaped from prison. Lector was hiding in Italy. He used a false name and driver's license so he would not be caught. The book is about a victim of his, named Mason Verger. Verger survived when Lecter tried to eat his face. He now wants to get revenge on Lecter. Mason Verger captures Lecter. He tries to kill him with attack hogs, but Lecter escapes with the help of Clarice Starling. Lecter was again played by Hopkins in the 2001 movie.\n\"Hannibal Rising\".\nThe final book in the series was \"Hannibal Rising\". It shows Lecter as a child. It tries to explain why he is a murderous cannibal by describing the death of his family during World War II. The critics did not like \"Hannibal Rising\" as much as they liked the first three books. This was mainly because people thought that the story was unrealistic. They also felt it was not true to the characters. Thomas Harris has said in many interviews that he only wrote the book because he was afraid that someone else would write a book about Lecter as a child. This book was also the basis for a film of the same name, with Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal.\nImpact on popular culture.\nThe character of Hannibal Lecter has become very popular in American culture. This is mainly because he is so scary. Lecter is often thought to be one of the best movie villains of all time, next to Freddy Krueger and Norman Bates. AFI listed him at #1 on their list \"Top 50 Movie Villains of All Time\""}

Sometimes called the sword lily, the most widely-used English common name for these plants is simply gladiolus (plural gladioli, gladioluses or sometimes gladiolas).\nDescription.\nThe genus \"Gladiolus\" contains about 260 species, of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa, mostly South Africa. About 10 species are native to Eurasia. There are 160 species of \"Gladiolus\" endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce.\nThese attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.\nTheir stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section.\nThe fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.\nThe ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate.\nThese flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red. \nThe South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and sphingid moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth \"Macroglossum stellatarum\" which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like \"Petunia\", \"Zinnia\", \"Dianthus\" and others.\nGladioli are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Large Yellow Underwing."}

Sugar gliders are actually related to possums\nAs pets.\nAround the world, the sugar glider is a popular domestic pet. It is one of the most commonly traded wild animals in the illegal pet trade, where animals are plucked directly from their natural habitats. \nIn Australia, sugar gliders can be kept in Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory but not Western Australia, New South Wales, ACT or Tasmania.\nSugar gliders are most popular as pets in the United States, where they are bred in large numbers.

The area was named in honor of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck.\nOn 13 March 1888, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost 100% of the volcano fell in to the ocean leaving a small lake in the volcanic crater.\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands.

{"id": "138930", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138930", "title": "Legal precedent", "text": "In common law legal systems, a precedent or authority is a legal case that establishes a principle or rule. This principle or rule is then used by the court or other judicial bodies use when deciding later cases with similar issues or facts. The use of precedent provides predictability, stability, fairness, and efficiency in the law. The Latin term stare decisis is the doctrine of legal precedent. \nThe precedent on an issue is the collective body of judicially announced principles that a court should consider when interpreting the law. When a precedent establishes an important legal principle, or represents new or changed law on a particular issue, that precedent is often known as a landmark decision.\nPrecedent is central to legal analysis and rulings in countries that follow common law like the United Kingdom and Canada (except Quebec). In some systems precedent is not binding but is taken into account by the courts.\nTypes of precedent.\nBinding precedent.\nPrecedent that must be applied or followed is known as \"binding precedent\" (alternately \"mandatory precedent\", \"mandatory\" or \"binding authority\", etc.). Under the doctrine of \"stare decisis\", a lower court must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In the United States state and federal courts, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court, and all regional courts fall under a supreme court. By definition decisions of lower courts are not binding on each other or any courts higher in the system, nor are appeals court decisions binding on each other or on local courts that fall under a different appeals court. Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings.\nOne law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows:\nIn extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to distinguish the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent in any event.\nPrecedent is not \"binding\" on a judge or \u201cmandatory\u201d\nin the same sense that laws are binding on citizens. A judge can't be\njailed or fined for disagreeing with it. His oath is not to\nprecedent, but at least for federal judges, is to \"the\nconstitution\nand the laws of the United States\". The Canons of Judicial\nEthics\ndo not mention obedience to precedent, but to \"the federal\nConstitution and that of the state whose laws they administer.\"\nThe Code\nof Judicial Conduct says nothing about precedent. In most cases,\nprecedent is the most reasonable interpretation of the Constitution\nand our laws, in which cases the oath to the constitution is most\nfaithfully observed by following precedent. But when a judge finds\nthe interpretation of the Constitution in a majority opinion\nunpersuasive, compared to the interpretation in the dissent, then\nfollowing precedent may violate the judge's oath. In a ruling where\nJudge Roy Moore saw such a distinction, he acknowledged its authority\nas precedent, but said\n\"[The] interpretation of the Constitution [by the Supreme Court\nmajority] is \"their\" interpretation. But nothing can conflict\nwith a sworn officer's oath to the Constitution.\" Of course\nchaos is the consequence of \"careless\" disregard of precedent. Citizens\ntrying to obey the law need a sense of what the law is.\nNon-binding / Persuasive precedent.\nPrecedent that is not mandatory but which is useful or relevant is known as \"persuasive precedent\" (or \"persuasive authority\" or \"advisory precedent\"). Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts, by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions, cases made in other parallel systems (for example, military courts, administrative courts, indigenous/tribal courts, State courts versus Federal courts in the United States), and in some exceptional circumstances, cases of other nations, treaties, world judicial bodies, etc.\nIn a case of first impression, courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other jurisdictions that have previously dealt with similar issues. Persuasive precedent may become binding through the adoption of the persuasive precedent by a higher court.\nCustom.\nLong-held custom, which has traditionally been recognized by courts and judges, is the first kind of precedent. Custom can be so deeply entrenched in the society at large that it gains the force of law. There need never have been a specific case decided on the same or similar issues in order for a court to take notice of customary or traditional precedent in its deliberations.\nCase law.\nThe other type of precedent is case law. In common law systems this type of precedent is granted more or less weight in the deliberations of a court according to a number of factors. Most important is whether the precedent is \"on point,\" that is, does it deal with a circumstance identical or very similar to the circumstance in the instant case? Second, when and where was the precedent decided? A recent decision in the same jurisdiction as the instant case will be given great weight. Next in descending order would be recent precedent in jurisdictions whose law is the same as local law. Least weight would be given to precedent that stems from dissimilar circumstances, older cases that have since been contradicted, or cases in jurisdictions that have dissimilar law.\nCritical analysis of precedent.\nCourt formulations.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated:\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated:\nPrecedents viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in developing interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become increasingly restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still.\nScholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedents in order to establish which precedents are most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.\nSuper stare decisis.\nSuper-stare decisis is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned, without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place. It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power, or alternately, to express a belief, or a critique of that belief, that some decisions should not be overturned.\nIn 1976, Richard Posner and William Landes coined the term \"super-precedent,\" in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations. Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision. The term \"super-precedent\" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision. In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in \"Roe v. Wade\"), that side can protect its position from being reversed \"by a kind of super-stare decisis.\" \nThe issue arose anew in the questioning of Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito during their confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Before the hearings the chair of the committee, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, wrote an op/ed in the \"New York Times\" referring to \"Roe\" as a \"super-precedent.\" He mentioned the concept (and made seemingly humorous references to \"super-duper precedent\") during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept. \nCriticism of Precedent.\nIn a controversial 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed over-reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority, rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of legal costs during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction, with two exceptions:"}

{"id": "139018", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139018", "title": "Furby", "text": "A Furby (plural Furbys or Furbies, according to Tiger Electronics.) is a popular electronic toy or robot, more specifically, a hamster/owl-like creature made by Tiger Electronics, which went through a time of being the \"must-have\" toy following its launch in the winter holiday season of 1998, with continuing sales until 2000. Furbies sold 1.8 million units in 1998, 14 million units in 1999, and altogether in its three years of original production, Furby sold over 40 million units, and its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages. A video game of the Furbies was released in 1998 by Hasbro Interactive with many activities. Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a programmed robot. In 2005, new Furbies were released, with voice-recognition and more complex facial movements, among many other changes and improvements. There was a common mistake that they repeated words that were said around them. This belief most likely came from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several intelligence agencies banned them from their offices.\nHistory.\nBirth of the Furby.\nDavid Hampton and Caleb Chung created the Furby in about nine months (in addition to an additional nine months spent designing the toy). That was the amount of time between Tiger Electronics showing an interest in his interactive creatures, during which Roger Schiffman bought the rights to it, and the time they hit store shelves. Furby's first public appearance was at the International Toy Fair in 1998. Furbys originally retailed for about US$35, and upon release Furbys flew off the shelves in toyshops. The demand for these toys during the 1998 holiday season drove the resale price over US$100 and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies sold for over US$300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to them, and sellers gave values to them. Some people continue to call their Furbies by the terms 'wedding Furby', 'tuxedo Furby', 'snowball Furby', 'biker Furby', and others. All, of course, were named rare by sellers, because they were so hard to find at the time. In a sure display of the demand for even one Furby, some sellers at the time scammed people out of a lot of money, without even having first given them a Furby. Parent battles, arguments, and fights grew higher at the popularity of them, and when retail supplies ran out, parents turned to the Internet, where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. This action led to many parents ending up on eBay.\nRevival.\nIn 2005 Furbies were re-introduced with the release of the new Emoto-Tronic Furby. The highly growing emotional realism of the Emoto-Tronic Furby has given birth to a number of Furby-like special interest groups. These communities want to bring features of the Furby experience into human society. The most visible of these groups include Furbish-to-English translators and Furby adoption agencies. \nFurby types.\nClassic Furbies.\nThe original Furbies were 6\u00a0inches (15\u00a0cm) tall. The main reason for their popularity was because of their apparent \"intelligence\", reflected in their ability to develop language skills. Furbies can communicate with one another via an infrared port located between their eyes. \nA simple electric motor and a system of cameras and gears close the Furby's eyes and mouth, raise its ears, and lift it off the ground in a \"faux\" display of mobility. The originals are still popular with many hackers as they can be dissected and made or changed to do other interesting things, including being able to say something insulting or humorous, like \"Shut up\". In particular, they can made be to do things with their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces. \nOther Furbies.\nFurby Babies.\nIn 1999, the Furby Babies line was introduced. Furby Babies are smaller than the original, have higher voices, and cannot dance, but switch to speaking English more quickly. They also have bigger vocabulary, and different \"Easter Eggs\" and \"games\" built into them. Baby furbies come in 24 different colors. All with white eye lashes, six different eyecolors.\nFurby Friends.\nBook Furbies were also released, including an interactive Furby-like Gizmo, from the movie Gremlins, a Furby-like Interactive Yoda based on the Star Wars character, and a Furby-like Interactive E.T. from the movie of the same name. Another 'friend of furby', called Shelby, is similar to Furby, but looks like a clam, has lots of improvement in memory, and has a different personality; it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies. They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds, they can sense being upside down (they say things like \"Shiver me timbers\" and \"Walk the plank\", in the style of a pirate ship captain, when you leave them upside-down for a long period of time), and they laugh when you \"tickle\" them (their antennae - or \"tennies\", as they like to call them). They also purr when you \"pet\" them. You can feed them by sticking your finger in their mouth. Similarly, Shelbys do not have their own names, unlike the classic Furbies. Shelbys are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby, saying phrases such as \"Where's Furby?\" - though they cannot tell the difference between a Furby and a Furby Baby - they just think it's a Furby. In addition to English, Shelbys also know some Furbish words and also have their own language called \"Shelbish.\"\n some Holiday furbies are limited edition, they were made in 2001\nEmoto-Tronic Furby.\nThe latest kinds of Furby were released in August 2005. Larger than the other ones, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, letting them communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them 'sleep', and they have an off switch. They can communicate with other types of Emoto-tronic Furbies, though to a smaller amont than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies. They also do not have light sensors and basic motion sensors. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island.\nEmoto-Tronic Furby Babies.\nIn 2006, a new version of Furby baby was released, with most notable features being the new look and a more \"Baby-ish\" appearance in contrast to the Emoto-Tronic Furby adult. They also have considerably less features than the \"adult\" Furby, with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity. Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto-Tronic Baby Furby is the movable \"legs\", which unfurl when Furby baby is awakened.\nFurbish-English dictionary.\nFurbish is the language which is spoken by the Furbies. It is similar to English with a different grammar structure. A newly bought Furby starts out speaking entirely Furbish, the unique language with short words, simple syllables, and various other sounds, that all Furbies use, but are programmed to speak less Furbish as they learn more English as they \"grow\". Throughout a Furby's lifetime, it gradually learns English words and phrases, which it begins to speak in place of Furbish. The more English they learn, the more they \"grow\", making them more muture. The Furbish phrase \"WHOA! Me deep sleep!\" would translate into English as \"Whoa! I slept for a long time!\"\nThese are common Furbish pharses.\nFurbies may say these Furbish words:"}

It was a class leader back in its day thanks to its fine ride and handling and was competing against many other modern cars such as the Honda Accord, the Toyota Carina and more. The car was sold as a 4 door sedan, hatchback, and station wagon. The Mk1 was discontinued in 1996 as the Mk2 replaces it.\nSecond Generation (Mk2 1996-2000).\nThe Mk2 Mondeo (or known as the Mk1 Mondeo facelift of makeover) started production in 1996. It was released due to bad problems with the Mk1 towards the time being of 1996: The headlights had bad performance, passengers would get squashed in the back seat of the car due to the small spacing between the front seats and the back, etc. The Mk2 lacked all that, but still kept a similar body to the Mk1. The Mk2 was discontinued in 2000 to leave space for the Mk3.\nThird Generation (Mk3 2000-2007).\nThe Mk3 started production in October 2000 to replace the Mk2. The Mk3 featured an all new design compared to previous models. The Mk3 was also wider and more comfortable than the previous models. It included all new headlights too.\n2003 saw a facelift of the Mk3. It featured Ford's new high-tech stereo, a more powerful A/C/Heater, and featured an updated interior. It also featured more classy body colours compared to the ones offered on the 2000-2003 Mk3.\nThey once again updated the model in 2005 to keep customers interested in the model. The Mk3 was discontinued in 2007 for the Mk4.\nFourth Generation (Mk4 2007-2014).\nThe Mk4 was released in May 2007 in the United Kingdom and had five different trim levels: Edge, Zetec, Ghia, Titanium, and Titanium X. The Ford Mondeo Mk4 is the successor to the Mk3 and has new sporty styling and more interior space, it received a facelift in October 2010. The Mk5 replacement was meant to arrive in 2013 but due to production delays, it was pushed back to October 2014.\nFifth Generation (Mk5 2014-2022).\nThe Mk5 Mondeo first launched in the US in 2012 as the Ford Fusion, it was meant to arrive in Europe in 2013 but production delays pushed its launch back to October 2014, due to production moving from Belgium to Spain. Like previous Mondeos, it comes in many bodystyles, engines and trim levels and is attractively styled. In March 2021, Ford announced that they will be ending production of the Mondeo in March 2022 due to falling sales and growing demand for SUV's like Ford's own Kuga which has often outsold it in recent years.

Enhancements in computers designs were done by increasing bit-level parallelism\nIncreasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. (For example, consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers. The processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer, then add the 8 higher-order bits, requiring two instructions to complete a single operation. A 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction)\nHistorically, 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors, then 64-bit microprocessors. 32-bit processors has been a standard in general purpose computing for about 20 years, but now 64-bit processors are taking the lead."}

Consider the following program:\n 1. e = a + b\n 2. f = c + d\n 3. g = e * f\nOperation 3 depends on the results of \"e\" and \"f\" which are calculated from operations 1 and 2, so \"g\" cannot be calculated until both of \"e\" and \"f\" are computed. However, operations 1 and 2 do not depend on any other operation, so they can be computed simultaneously. If we assume that each operation can be completed in one unit of time then these three instructions can be completed in a total of two units of time, giving an ILP factor of 3/2; which means 3/2 = 1.5 greater than without ILP.\nOne of the goals of compilers and processors designers is to use as much ILP as possible. Ordinary programs are written execute instructions in sequence; one after the other, in the order as written by programmers. ILP allows the compiler and the processor to overlap the execution of multiple instructions or even to change the order in which instructions are executed.\nHow much ILP exists in programs depends on the application type, for example, in graphics and scientific applications the amount can be very large while in cryptography the amount much less.\nMicro-architectural techniques that use ILP include:\nIn recent years, ILP techniques have been used for performance improvements in conditions where the difference between processor operating frequencies and memory access times is large. As of 2008, a cache \"miss\" costs several hundreds of CPU cycles in a main memory access; with much longer latency compared when the processor finds that the memory location is in the cache. Hence, this technique was proved to be insufficient to save the CPU time from waiting for the off-chip data. Instead, the industry is moving towards improving higher levels of parallelism using techniques such as multiprocessing and multithreading. "}

Different execution threads communicate with one another usually to pass data as they work.\nAs a simple example, if we are running code on a 2-processor system (CPUs \"a\" &amp; \"b\") in a parallel computing environment and we want to do tasks \"A\" and \"B\", it is possible to tell CPU \"a\" to do task \"A\" and CPU \"b\" to do task 'B\" simultaneously (at the same time), in order to reduce the runtime of the execution. \nTask parallelism is used by multi-user and multitasking operating systems, and applications depending on processes and threads, unlike data processing applications (see data parallelism). Most real programs use a combination of Task parallelism and Data parallelism."}

In some operating systems running on some hardware, switching between threads belonging to the same process is much faster than switching to a thread from different process (because threads from different processes require a more complicated process context switch). \nDuring the thread switching, the CPU must save all of the current thread's execution data to memory, and load another thread's execution data from memory. Since reading and writing from memory requires some latency, we can define the thread switching latency as the amount of time needed to complete this operation.

It is the sequel to Walt Disney's 1967 movie \"The Jungle Book\". Haley Joel Osment did the voice of Mowgli, and John Goodman did the voice of Baloo. The movie was going to be a direct-to-video movie, but it was released in theaters first. The movie is not based on \"The Second Jungle Book\" by Rudyard Kipling (published in 1895). However, they do have some of the same characters. When released, the movie was criticised mainly for its bad animation and a story similar to the original movie. Disney released the VHS and DVD versions on June 10, 2003. On June 17, 2008 a Special Edition DVD was released.\nThe story.\nMowgli feels unwelcome and out of place in the human village where he now lives. When Baloo arrives for a visit, Mowgli leaves with him to go back to the jungle. However, his friend Shanti thinks he was kidnapped. She follows him into the jungle. Shere Khan is still hunting for Mowgli, which puts him, as well as Shanti and Baloo, in danger. Mowgli must decide whether he wants to live in the jungle with Baloo, or stay in the village with Shanti.\nSoundtrack.\nThe band Smash Mouth recorded a cover of the Sherman Brothers song, \"I Wanna Be Like You\" (originally from the 1967 musical movie), which is featured on this movie's soundtrack.\nReception.\nCriticism.\nMany people thought that \"The Jungle Book 2\" was too much like the original 1967 classic.

He is known as the lieutenant of the Kelly Gang. He was shot dead in the siege of Glenrowan. Joe Byrne was a very good shot, a good horseman and skilled at living in the bush. This made it difficult for the police to capture him. His skill at writing helped him to write the items that were important in starting the Kelly legend. He wrote the famous Jerilderie letter. There is also a legend that Ned Kelly, with Byrne's help, was going to start an independent republic in north east Victoria. The siege at Glenrowan was the first step.\nEarly life.\nJoe was born at Woolshed, near Beechworth, in November 1856. His father, Patrick Byrne, had come from County Carlow, Ireland, in 1849, to join his father, Joseph, who had come to Australia as a convict in 1834. Joe's mother was an Irish lady from Galway. The family moved to Sebastopol, a small gold mining town, about two kilometres farther up the valley. Joe learned to speak Chinese from the Chinese miners who lived in a small camp near his house. He was educated at a small Roman Catholic school at Woolshed.\nAfter leaving school in 1870, Joe had a number of jobs including driving a delivery cart for a tannery, putting up fences, looking for gold, wood cutting, and shearing. He often visited the Chinese village at Beechworth and became addicted to opium. During the celebrations for the Prince of Wales birthday in 1873, Joe saw a suit of Chinese armour in the Beechworth museum. This armour provided the ideas for the armour the Kelly Gang wore at Glenrowan.\nCrime.\nIn September 1873, Byrne was in court for taking a neighbour, Anton Wick's horse. He had ridden it for several days before bringing it back. He had to pay a fine of 20 shillings. In December 1875, he was in court again for taking a saddle, but the court believed Byrne when he said he had found it in the bush. On May 20, 1876, Joe Byrne and his friend, Aaron Sherritt, stole a cow and cut it up for the meat. Someone saw them and told the police. They were taken to court and given six months in the Beechworth Gaol. In prison, Byrne and Sherritt met Jim Kelly, who was the brother of Ned and Dan Kelly. Joe Byrne met Ned Kelly in 1876 and they became friends.\nThe Kelly Gang.\nByrne was probably at the Kelly house on 15 April, 1878, when Constable Fitzpatrick said that Ned Kelly shot him and that Ellen Kelly, Ned's mother, had hit him over the head with a shovel. Ned and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the bush at Bullock Creek, an old gold mining area. The police offered a reward of \u00a3100 for them, and Ellen Kelly was sent to gaol for three years.\nStringybark Creek.\nJoe Byrne was at Stringybark Creek with the Kelly brothers and Steve Hart on 26 October, 1878, when they found four police officers on their trail, and shot three of them dead. Joe Byrne shot dead Trooper Scanlon, and was wearing Scanlon's ring at the time of his death. The gang were made outlaws on 15 November 1878, which meant they could be legally killed by anyone at any time. A reward of \u00a32000 (about AU$754,000 in 2008) was offered for them, dead or alive.\nBushranger.\nByrne was Kelly's lieutenant, and the two of them planned the gang's actions. The Kelly Gang robbed the Euroa branch of the National Bank of Australia and took over \u00a32,000. Joe Byrne wrote a letter in red ink for Ned Kelly which was sent to Donald Cameron, a local member of the Victorian Parliament. Ned said justice had not been done in the case of his mother and himself. It ended: \"For I need no lead or powder to revenge my cause, and if words be louder I will oppose your laws.\"\nThe police locked up over 20 possible supporters of the Kelly gang between January 1879 and April 1879 under the \"Felons Apprehension Act 1878\". This increased public support for the gang, especially in north east Victoria. Joe Byrne was able to use this increase this by writing a number poems about Ned Kelly and his gang, including \"My Name is Ned Kelly\":\nMy friends are all united,\nMy mates are lying near.\nWe sleep beneath shady trees,\nNo danger do we fear.\nJoe Byrne often visited his mother at her house in Beechworth. He was also seen drinking in hotels in the town, even though there was a reward for him. He could do it because of his skill and daring, and because the police were badly trained and badly led, and because of the support of local people for the Kelly Gang.\nJerilderie.\nKelly and Byrne planned their next robbery for Jerilderie. On 10 February, 1879, dressed as policemen, the gang robbed the Bank of New South Wales at Jerilderie taking another \u00a32,000. Byrne wrote the Jerilderie Letter after Ned kelly\u2019s words which wanted an independent republic in north east Victoria. The money from both the Euroa and Jerilderie robberies was given to the gang's family, friends and supporters.\nAfter the Jerilderie robbery, the gang went into hiding for 16 months. This increased their reputation and embarrassed the government of Victoria and the police. The Victorian Government increased the reward for the Kelly Gang to \u00a38,000 (about AU$2,000,000 in 2005).\nSiege of Glenrowan.\nByrne and Kelly planned another bank robbery in Benalla in 1880. They thought Aaron Sherritt was being used by police to get information about them. Byrne had told Sherritt to tell the police that the gang was planning a robbery in the Goulburn River while they were really planning the Jerilderie robbery. Kelly and Byrne believed that Sherritt could no longer be trusted. They also knew he was being protected by the police. Byrne and Dan Kelly murdered Sherritt on 26 June, 1880. Ned Kelly believed that this would bring a large group of police to Beechworth to search for the killers.\nThe next day, the Kelly Gang took over the town of Glenrowan. They tore up the railway tracks because they knew the police would travel by train to Beechworth. They held over 60 people hostage in Jones' Hotel. Thomas Curnow, the local school teacher, escaped and stopped the police train before it could crash on the missing track. The police were able to surround the hotel.\nJoe Byrne helped design the armour worn by all members of the gang at Glenrowan. This did not stop him from being shot in the groin cutting his femoral artery. He was in the middle of a speech about the gang when he was shot. He died quickly from loss of blood on 28 June 1880. The police set fire to the hotel, but they dragged his body out of the hotel before it burned down. The bodies of Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were not brought out of the hotel, and were severely burned.\nThe next day his body was hung on the door of the police cells at Benalla, and photographed by newspaper reporters. It was only removed after a young woman begged the police to let Byrne rest in peace. His family did not take his body and the police would not give it to anyone else, they thought a funeral would become a starting point for a rebellion. He was buried in an unmarked grave on the edge of the Benalla cemetery.\nNed Kelly was captured and tried in Melbourne. Ned Kelly was hanged at Old Melbourne Gaol on 11 November 1880. There is a legend that Kelly and Byrne had written a Declaration for the Republic of north-east Victoria which was destroyed by the Victorian Government.\nByrne and the Kelly legend.\nBy writing the letters and the bush ballads, and designing the armour, Joe Byrne and Ned Kelly helped make the Kelly legend. In the following 125 years, the legend has grown. There have been a number of movies made about the Kelly Gang including \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" in 1906, the world's first feature-length movie. In 2003, Orlando Bloom played the part of Joe Byrne in Gregor Jordan's movie, \"Ned Kelly\".\nAustralian novelist Peter Carey won the 2001 Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers Prize for the \"True History of the Kelly Gang\". This was based on the Jerilderie letter written by Byrne.\nNed Kelly and the Kelly Gang has been made famous by Sidney Nolan wearing the armour designed by Joe Byrne in a famous set of paintings. This was used as a scene at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney."}

It was once the centre of Nundle Shire. Most of this area, including the village of Nundle, was added to the new Tamworth Regional Council in 2004. The village is 400\u00a0km north of Sydney and about 56\u00a0km south east of Tamworth. In 2006 there were 289 people living in Nundle.\nHistory.\nNundle was settled when gold was found nearby at \u201cThe Hanging Rock\u201d and Swamp Creek in 1852. By June 1852 there were 300 people digging for gold at Oakenville Creek. People from California, Europe and China were also digging along the Peel River and up the mountain slopes. By 1865 there were about 500 people living there and about 50 shops and small businesses had started. A school building was put up in December 1871. Lessons started in 1872. Nundle was made a town in 1885. In 1924 the Peel River Bridge was built. In 1941 electricity was connected to the town. During 1966 the swimming pool was opened by the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. There were 1350 people living in the area in 1969. In 1979 the Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, opened the new Chaffey Dam. Sheep, cattle and timber are now the main business activities in Nundle.\nThere are many old buildings: the Nundle Woollen Mill, old Court House, Peel Inn and Primitive Methodist Church. The old Nundle Courthouse and Police Station have been placed on the Register of the National Estate.\nNundle is of the best areas in the State for finding crystals. Some gold and other precious stones can be found including zircons, green jasper, sapphires and serpentine minerals. Nundle is a popular tourist destination for both casual travellers and motorcycle riders. Nearby is the interesting Hanging Rock mining village with good views of the Nundle valley.\nA new bridge across the Peel River at Nundle was finished in 2008. The cost of $683,000 was paid by the NSW State Government.\nIn July 2008 the rare Euphrasia arguta was rediscovered in a State Forest near Nundle. This plant was last recorded in 1904. It is believed to have grown after fire control burning the previous summer.\nEvents.\nThe annual Go for Gold Festival is held each Easter with around 4,000 visitors. The State Member for Tamworth told the NSW Parliament \u201cthat visitors had come to Nundle from all points of the compass during the Easter weekend to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and the beautiful setting.\u201d The Great Nundle Dog Race, only open to working dogs, is run on the first Sunday in May and attracts many visitors.

This allows the CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step, which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step.\nThe term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying a single microinstruction (like a drop of water), and each step is linked to another step (analogy; similar to water pipes).\nMost modern CPUs are driven by a clock. The CPU consists internally of logic and memory (flip flops). When the clock signal arrives, the flip flops store their new value then the logic requires a period of time to decode the flip flops new values. Then the next clock pulse arrives and the flip flops store another values, and so on. By breaking the logic into smaller pieces and inserting flip flops between pieces of logic, the time required by the logic (to decode values till generating valid outputs depending on these values) is reduced. In this way the clock period can be reduced.&lt;br&gt;For example, the RISC pipeline is broken into five stages with a set of flip flops between each stage as follows:\nProcessors with pipelining consist internally of stages (modules) which can semi-independently work on separate microinstructions. Each stage is linked by flip flops to the next stage (like a \"chain\") so that the stage's output is an input to another stage until the job of processing instructions is done. Such organization of processor internal modules reduces the instruction's overall processing time.\nA non-pipeline architecture is not as efficient because some CPU modules are idle while another module is active during the instruction cycle. Pipelining does not completely remove idle time in a pipelined CPU, but making CPU modules work in parallel increases instruction throughput.\nAn instruction pipeline is said to be \"fully pipelined\" if it can accept a new instruction every clock cycle. A pipeline that is not fully pipelined has wait cycles that delay the progress of the pipeline.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Pipelining.\nAdvantages of Pipelining:\nDisadvantages of Pipelining:&lt;br&gt;\nExamples.\nGeneric pipeline.\nTo the right is a generic pipeline with four stages:\nThe top gray box is the list of instructions waiting to be executed; the bottom gray box is the list of instructions that have been completed; and the middle white box is the pipeline.\nExecution is as follows:\nBubble.\nWhen a \"hiccup\" (interruption) in execution occurs, a \"bubble\" is created in the pipeline in which nothing useful happens. In cycle 2, the fetching of the purple instruction is delayed and the decoding stage in cycle 3 now contains a bubble. Everything behind the purple instruction is delayed as well but everything in front of the purple instruction continues with execution.\nClearly, when compared to the execution above, the bubble yields a total execution time of 8 clock ticks instead of 7.\nBubbles are like stalls (delays), in which nothing useful will happen for the fetch, decode, execute and writeback. It is like a NOP (short for No OPeration) code.\nExample 1.\nA typical instruction to add two numbers might be codice_1, which adds the values found in memory locations A and B, and then puts the result in memory location C. In a pipelined processor the pipeline controller would break this into a series of tasks similar to:\nThe locations 'R1' and 'R2' are registers in the CPU. The values stored in memory locations labeled 'A' and 'B' are loaded (copied) into these registers, then added, and the result is stored in a memory location labeled 'C'.\nIn this example the pipeline is three stages long- load, execute, and store. Each of the steps are called pipeline stages.\nOn a non-pipelined processor, only one stage can be working at a time so the entire instruction has to complete before the next instruction can begin. On a pipelined processor, all of the stages can be working at once on different instructions. So when this instruction is at the execute stage, a second instruction will be at the decode stage and a 3rd instruction will be at the fetch stage.\nExample 2.\nTo better understand the concept, we can look at a theoretical 3-stage pipeline:\nand a pseudo-code assembly listing to be executed:\nThis is how it would be executed:\nThe LOAD instruction is fetched from memory.\nThe LOAD instruction is executed, while the MOVE instruction is fetched from memory.\nThe LOAD instruction is in the Store stage, where its result (the number 40) will be stored in the register A.\nIn the meantime, the MOVE instruction is being executed. \nSince it must move the contents of A into B, it must wait for the ending of the LOAD instruction.\nThe STORE instruction is loaded, while the MOVE instruction is finishing off and the ADD is calculating.\nAnd so on. Note that, sometimes, an instruction will depend on the result of another one (like our MOVE example). When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either reading it (as an input) or writing it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can lead to the hazards situation (mentioned above)."}

Most modern processors used in personal computers, mainframes, and supercomputers have instruction sizes between 16 and 64 bits. In some architectures, especially Reduced instruction set computers, instructions are of fixed length, typically corresponding with that architecture's word size.\nOn traditional architectures, an instruction includes an opcode specifying the operation to be performed, such as \"add contents of memory to register\", and zero or more operand specifiers, which may specify registers, memory locations, or literal data. The operand specifiers may have addressing modes determining their meaning or may be in fixed fields.\nIn VLIW architectures, which include many microcode architectures, multiple simultaneous operations and operands are specified in a single instruction.\nInstructions are rarely specified using their machine code form; they may be specified by programmers using an assembly language or, more commonly, may be generated by compilers.\nThere is another more general definition for an \"instruction\" not only related to the processor instruction set, which is: An \"instruction\" may be any representation of an element of an executable computer program."}

This means the CPU executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle by running multiple instructions at the same time (called instruction dispatching) on duplicate functional units. Each functional unit is just an execution resource inside the CPU core, like an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), floating point unit (FPU), a bit shifter, or a multiplier.\nMost superscalar CPUs are also pipelined, but it's possible to have a non-pipelined superscalar CPU or a pipelined non-superscalar CPU.\nThe superscalar technique is supported by several features of the CPU core:\nEach instruction run by a scalar processor changes one or two data items at a time, but each instruction executed by a vector processor handles many data items at once. A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two:\nIn a superscalar CPU an instruction dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel, dispatching them on the multiple duplicate functional units available inside the CPU.\nSuperscalar CPU design is concerned with improving accuracy of the instruction dispatcher, and allowing it to keep the multiple functional units busy at all times. As of 2008, all general-purpose CPUs are superscalar, a typical superscalar CPU may include up to 4 ALUs, 2 FPUs, and two SIMD units. If the dispatcher can't keep all of the units busy, the performance of the CPU will be lower.\nLimitations.\nPerformance improvement in Superscalar CPU design is limited by two things: \nEven given infinitely fast dependency checking inside a normal superscalar CPU, if the instruction list itself has many dependencies, this would also limit the possible performance improvement, so the amount of built-in parallelism in the code is another limitation.\nNo matter how fast the dispatcher speed, there is a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched. While hardware advances will allow for more functional units (e.g., ALUs) per CPU core, the problem of checking instruction dependencies increases to a limit that the achievable superscalar dispatching limit is somewhat small. -- Likely on the order of five to six simultaneously dispatched instructions.\nAlternatives.\nThe various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusive\u2014they can be (and frequently are) combined in a single processor, so it is possible to design a multicore CPU is where each core is an independent processor with multiple parallel superscalar pipelines. Some multicore processors also include vector capability."}

A theory has been postulated that an anti-phase pattern exists between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High\u2014controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillation\u2014was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. In fact, few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000\u20131400 BC and again during the most recent millennium; these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3\u20135 times.

Most modern CPU designs include support for out of order execution.\nThe key concept of OoO processing is to allow the processor to avoid a class of delays (termed: \"stalls \") that occur when the data needed to perform an operation are unavailable.\nOoO processors fill these \"slots\" in time with other instructions that are ready, then re-order the results at the end to make it appear that the instructions were processed as normal. The way the instructions are ordered in the original computer code is known as program order, in the processor they are handled in data order (the order in which the data, operands, become available in the processor's registers). Fairly complex circuitry is needed to convert from one ordering to the other and maintain a logical ordering of the output; the processor itself appears to be running the instructions in random order.\nThe benefit of OoO processing grows as the instruction pipeline expands and the speed difference between main memory (or cache memory) and the processor increases. On modern machines, the processor runs many times faster than the memory, so during the time an in-order processor spends waiting for data to arrive, it could have processed a large number of instructions.\nIn earlier In-order processors, the processing of instructions is normally done in these steps:\nOut-of-order processors breaks up the processing of instructions into these steps:\nIn the examples outlined above, the OoO processor avoids the stall that occurs in step (2) of the in-order processor when the instruction is not completely ready to be processed due to missing data."}

{"id": "139444", "revid": "10700", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139444", "title": "Key exchange", "text": "Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between users, allowing use of a cryptographic system.\nIf two parties wish to exchange encrypted messages, each needs to know how to decrypt received messages and to encrypt sent messages. The information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use. If they use a code, both will require a copy of the same codebook. If they use a cipher, they will need appropriate keys. If the cipher is a symmetric key cipher, both will need a copy of the same key. If an asymmetric key cipher with the public/private key property, both will need the other's public key.\nThe key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so, in such a way, that no one else can obtain a copy. Usually, this required trusted secure channel. With the arrival of (public key / private key) cipher algorithms, the encrypting key (aka, the public key) could be made public, since (at least for \"high quality\" ciphers) no one without the decrypting key (aka, the private key) could decrypt the message.\nIn principle, then, the only remaining problem was to be sure that a public key actually belonged to its claimed owner, this is not a problem easy to solve; specially when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other.\nIn 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a cryptographic protocol, (Diffie-Hellman key exchange), which allows users to establish secure channels in order to exchange keys, even if an attacker is monitoring that communication channel. However, Diffie-Hellman key exchange did not address the \"identity authentication\" problem of being sure of the actual identity of the person or an entity.\nPublic key infrastructures have been proposed go around the problem of \"identity authentication\". In their most usual implementation, each user applies to a \"certificate authority\" for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a correct (termed: non-tamperable) authentication of identity.\nIn contrast, the web of trust system, which do not use central \"certificate authority\" at all. Each user is responsible for verifying any certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user who claims to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate, (see digital signatures).\nThe problem of key exchange has not yet been solved. In particular, it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically, as, for instance, in electronic commerce. Some of the existing work-around designs work, more or less, but are not fully satisfactory."}

In 1970, the Sultan introduced a complete new set of national flags. Bands of green and white were added to the fly, and the national emblem, the badge of the Albusaidi Dynasty, was placed in the canton. This shows crossed swords over a Gambia, a traditional curved dagger. White has been associated historically with the Imam, the religious leader of Oman and at times the political rival to the ruling Sultan. It also symbolizes peace. Green is traditionally associated with the Jebel al Akhdar, or \"Green Mountains,\" which lie toward the north of the country. Red is a common color in Gulf state flags. The national emblem is said to date back to the 18th century. A curved dagger is fastened over a pair of crossed swords. An ornate horsebit links the weapons."}

It does not rain very often and snow is rare. Protected by the Luberon, a mountain range, the town is sheltered from the mistral, a cold dry wind that blows from the north. The town was first built on a hill which was easy to defend. After the town was destroyed in 1545, it was rebuilt on the plain, near the river.\nHistory.\nA ferry was in use to cross the Durance River in the year 1240. M\u00e9rindol was abandoned, probably because of plague, in the 15th century.\nIn the late Middle Ages, Louis II of Provence sold the land to the lords of Abacus-Cental and Rocca Sparviera. They moved in farming families from Piedmont. The farmers were followers of Pierre Vaudes (Peter Waldo). They were part of a group, known as the Vaudois or Waldensians, who had separated from the Catholic Church in 1170. They believed in a simple life based on a line in the Gospel of Matthew. This put them in opposition to the rich and powerful church. In 1530, a Dominican priest, Jean de Roma, began a campaign against the Vaudois because he said they were heretics. His gangs attacked the town and burnt many houses and killed many of the people.\nIn 1540, de Roma arrested a flour miller from M\u00e9rindol, took his mill, and then burned the man at the stake. On November 18 1540, 19 more people were sentenced to death by burning at the stake, and the town was ordered to be completely destroyed. A group from the town went to the king to save the people and the village. He gave them until 1545 AD to give up their religion and rejoin the Catholic Church. On April 18 1545, the village was completely burned and about 12 of the Vaudois still living there were killed. Over one week there were attacks on 11 other small villages, and it is thought that about 3000 people were killed. Many of the Vaudois from M\u00e9rindol were able to escape and ran away to Switzerland.\nThe Path of Memory.\nIn 1977, members of Vaudois organizations in Germany, France and Italy built a path in memory of the people who had been killed for their religious beliefs. The path leads to the ruins of the Vaudois church."}

Using VOIP will reduce costs, as the \"dedicated line\" for telephony (and fax) is no longer needed.\nThere are a number of technical problems that must be solved first, though:\nThe vast majority of VoIP systems rely on the two main protocols.\nSIP :- SIP, or also known as session initiation protocol, has become the standard for multimedia sessions on the internet. The Engineering Task Force thinks of this protocol as the standard for audio, video and even instant messaging solutions. This task force is simply a large, international community, composed of anyone involved in the networking evolution online. SIP is modular, meaning that it can be changed around in whatever way needed. Depending on the type of data your business is wishing to transmit, your SIP deployment will need to be designed specifically for this. With that being said, VoIP and IM communications will need to work around these aspects, and be designed for one total approach. \nH.323 :- This protocol has become the international standard for all communication over packet-switched networks. This includes LAN, WAN and even the general internet networks we all connect to. H.323 is considered an umbrella that includes all types of standards, which is what the internet is based on. H.323 focuses on voice, video, and data communications, designed specifically to operate over IP networks. At this point, this protocol has become the world market leader for voice and voice communications over IP networks.

It was created on 12 August 1793 with four districts: Apt, Orange, Ouv\u00e8ze (Carpentras), Vaucluse (Avignon); its capital was Avignon.\nIn 1800, with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in France, the districts were changed into \"arrondissements\": Avignon, Apt, Carpentras and Orange.\nAfter the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), the department was occupied by the Austrian army from June 1815 to November 1818.\nOn 10 September 1926, the \"arrondissement\" of Orange was eliminated and the subprefecture of Apt was moved to Cavaillon but went back to Apt in 1933.\nGeography.\nVaucluse is part of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region, in southeast France, with an area of .

The idea was based on a concept by Ralph Merkle.\nDiffie and Hellman wanted to make Transport Layer Security (TLS), a secure way of computers communicating, more safe to perform. For example, while you can use a password to keep a file safe, if you need to tell the password to somebody there is a risk of the password being seen by third parties. Diffie-Hellman key agreement itself is an \"anonymous\" (non-\"authenticated\") key-agreement protocol: people involved in the trade do not need to prove who they are, but both people need to use their secret keys to fully decrypt the data. \nBasic Example.\nAlice and Bob both start at the same number (\"10\") and both do half of a sum, which means they both get the same result without seeing what the other person added (15 and 30). This is useful in cryptography because Alice and Bob do not share their private numbers, which means a third party cannot spy on the result (55) unless they can find both private numbers; even if a third party knows Alice sent \"10\" + 15 = 25, they don't know the result is 55 unless they also know Bob sent 30.\nSince only Alice and Bob know their private numbers, this is a good way of sending secure information if the numbers are very big and the calculations are difficult. Since computers can use very complicated math to encrypt things, this stops people from trying a brute force attack to guess the numbers until it works. One example of how big calculations are made this way is the original version of Diffie-Hellman, which used both multiplicative group of integers modulo n and primitive root modulo n.\nRisks.\nWhile very useful, Diffie-Hellman is at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack. Alice and Bob do not need to prove who they are to swap their information, which means there is a risk that Charlie can look at the information while it is being swapped, and can even pretend to be Alice or Bob to try and figure out their keys. One way this is avoided is to use authentication, where people perform extra steps to prove who they are."}

Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key-agreement protocol, for-instance using public-key cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman or using symmetric-key cryptography such as Kerberos.\nThe shared secret can be used for authentication (for instance when logging in to a remote system) using methods such as challenge-response or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more keys to use for encryption and/or MACing of messages.\nTo make unique session and message keys the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector (IV).

This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols, because applications do not need to be designed to use IPsec, whereas the use of TLS/SSL or other higher-layer protocols must be built-in the application.\nThe term \"IPsec\" is officially defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This definition includes the form of capitalization used for the term; it is often incorrectly spelled \"IPSec\"."}

During the storm, an earthquake shook the region.\n1817 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. A hurricane was first observed near Tobago on August 1 before continuing through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico by August 6. It crossed over Florida, and when it reached the western Atlantic, it paralleled the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina. It moved inland over southern North Carolina, and brought heavy rain to the Norfolk, Virginia area, delaying mail delivery and causing flooding through the mid-Atlantic as it moved northward into Pennsylvania by August 9. Its track appears similar to that of Hurricane Charley of August 2004.\nII. Barbados was struck by a hurricane on October 21, causing 250 deaths as it moved through the Lesser Antilles. The hurricane subsequently moved into Nicaragua by October 26.\n1818 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI.

The hurricane intensified to a Category 2-3 before hitting Galveston, Texas on September 12 and continuing onward to Mississippi. The hurricane was \"quite severe\", destroying all but six houses on Galveston Island.\nIII. A tropical cyclone seriously affected Puerto Rico on September 22. It possibly recurved sharply offshore the Eastern Seaboard, as the frigate Macedonian encountered a hurricane on the 26th and 27th to the east-northeast of Bermuda. The breeze freshened that afternoon as the ship lay near 35.6N 55.7W. By sunset, waves increased to nine feet, and southeast gales lashed the system after midnight on the 27th. Winds continued to increase into that afternoon, as seas increased to . One man fell overboard by 5 p.m. and drowned. The hurricane reached its full violence by 10 p.m., splitting the storm staysails, and making the rigging useless. The main mast cracked under the strain by 2 a.m. on the 28th, and the mizzenmast followed suit by 4 a.m.. Seawater poured into the ship from all sides, as the wooden hull twisted under the force of the waves. The ship finally cleared the storm without capsizing by noon, and finally got to see a sunset by the evening of the 29th (from Chronicles of the Frigate Macedonian 1809-1922 p.\u00a0129-139).\nIV.

Between November 6 and 13, another hurricane moved across the southwest Caribbean Sea into Jamaica and Cuba.\n1819 Atlantic hurricane season.\nBay St. Louis Hurricane.\nThe exact origin of this hurricane is unknown, but it likely formed off the coast of Cuba before heading on a west-northwest track towards the Gulf Coast. A small hurricane, it reached an estimated Category 3-4 strength before making landfall on July 27 in southeastern Louisiana, bringing heavy winds and a 5\u20136\u00a0ft storm surge. The hurricane continued northeastward, making a second landfall in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi before dissipating inland. Known as one of the most destructive hurricanes to affect the United States during the first half of the 19th century, the Bay St. Louis Hurricane caused severe damage across Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, leaving behind the remains of shattered buildings and uprooted trees. Several vessels (from small boats to 60-ton brigs) were driven ashore by the hurricane's storm surge. One of them was the capsizing of the U.S. warship Firebrand, drowning 39 sailors. Several U.S. solders were caught off guard by the hurricane and died in its midst. There were also reports of people being attacked by alligators, snapping turtles, and snakes, which further added to the death toll. The hurricane caused over $100,000\u00a0dollars (1819 US dollars) in damage, and killed between 43 and 175 people, some of them later found washed up across the Gulf Coast.\nOther storms.\nII. A tropical storm hit between New Orleans and Apalachicola in September.\nIII. Between September 19 and 26, a hurricane tracked through the northeast Lesser Antilles and southwest of Bermuda.

Most tropical cyclone formation is between June 1 and November 30.\n1830 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. A hurricane moved from Trinidad to western Cuba between August 3 and August 9.\nAtlantic Coast Hurricane.\nII. First noted in the Leeward Islands on August 11, a hurricane moved into the Caribbean in the middle of August. It moved west-northwestward, and approached the coast of Florida. It came close to present-day Daytona Beach on August 15, but recurved northeastward before landfall, although land was not spared from effects. It made landfall near Cape Fear on the 16th and went out to sea that night, eventually well to the north of Bermuda just offshore the Canadian Maritimes. The hurricane broke a three-month drought, but caused heavy crop damage in the process.\nIII. A hurricane tracked north of the Leeward Islands on August 19 through the southwest and western Atlantic by August 26.\nIV. A hurricane moved from north of Puerto Rico on September 29 to well northeast of Bermuda on October 1.\nV. A tropical storm struck South Carolina on October 6.\n1831 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. A tropical storm made landfall in northeast Florida on June 10.\nII. A hurricane moved from south of Barbados to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula between June 22 and June 28.\nGreat Barbados Hurricane.\nIII. The Great Barbados Hurricane was an intense Category 4 hurricane that left cataclysmic damage across the Caribbean and Louisiana in 1831. It left 2,500 people dead and $7\u00a0million (1831\u00a0dollars) in damage.\nIV. A strong tropical storm/hurricane struck western Louisiana between August 27 and August 30.\nV. A hurricane hit near the mouth of the Rio Grande, causing heavy rain over Texas and Mexico.\n1832 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. Early in the season, a hurricane moved through the Bahamas around June 5, causing 52 deaths. The gale began June 6 at 8 p.m. at Bermuda from the northeast, with the center passing quite close to the island as the wind shifted to southwest at 10:30\u00a0p.m. The storm lasted until 3 a.m. on June 7. Two schooners were damaged during the system. (from Beware the Hurricane)\nII. On August 12, this hurricane was noted near Key West. The cyclone moved across the eastern Gulf of Mexico striking northwest Florida, then recurving through the Southeast to move through South Carolina by August 18.\nIII. On August 21 a tropical storm was witnessed to the west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands in the eastern tropical Atlantic.\nIV. Between August 23 and August 27, a hurricane moved from the central Leeward Islands to the east of Jamaica.\nV. On October 14, a tropical storm moved into South Carolina.\n1833 Atlantic hurricane season.\nA hurricane passed offshore of Norfolk in late August, keeping ships at harbor but causing no damage.\n1834 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. On September 4 a hurricane hit South Carolina, causing 37 deaths. It moved through North Carolina and Virginia, capsizing the ship \"E. Pluribus Unum\". The crew made it safely to shore.\nII. A hurricane struck the island of Dominica on September 20, bringing heavy winds and a 12\u00a0ft storm surge that devastated the capital of Roseau; 230 people are believed to have been killed by the hurricane's onslaught. Then the hurricane made its second landfall at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on the 23rd. About 170 sailors died when their ships sank in the Ozama River. On land the hurricane disrupted the funeral service of Padre Ruiz, a Roman Catholic priest. A total of 400 people were killed from the hurricane.\nIII. Also in September, a hurricane hit south Texas, causing heavy damage.\n1835 Atlantic hurricane season.\nAntigua Hurricane.\nA hurricane was first detected near Antigua on August 12. It moved over Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba, causing at least 3 casualties. It moved across the Florida Straits and the Gulf of Mexico, hitting near the mouth of the Rio Grande on August 18. There, it destroyed small villages, caused strong storm surge, and killed 18 people.\nJay Barnes in \"Florida's Hurricane History\" pg 56, noted a hurricane, possibly the same, that smashed Cape Florida and Key Biscayne, creating the Norris Cut and knocking over the Ponce de Leon lighthouse. From there, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and took a hard northeast tack, damaging Fort Brooke in Tampa, terrorizing the city, and then ambling northward into Georgia and the Carolinas, making the trip \"all the way into New England.\"\n1836 Atlantic hurricane season.\nA hurricane hit the Cayman Islands during this season.\n1837 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. On July 26 a storm hit Martinique. It caused 57 deaths.\nII. On August 2, a hurricane hit Puerto Rico, causing 141 deaths.\nIII. A tropical system was observed east of the West Indies on August 13. It moved through the islands, and passed the Bahamas on the 16th. As it was recurving, it hit the North Carolina coast on the 18th. It slowly moved over land, causing 48 hours of strong winds, and moved offshore on the 20th. This is known as the Calypso Hurricane.\nRacer's Storm.\nIV. The 10th known tropical storm in the 1837 season, nicknamed Racer's Storm, was first observed in the Western Caribbean during late September. It moved across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the western Gulf of Mexico, where it hit Brownsville, Texas on October 2. It remained over land for 3\u00a0days before recurving to the east, hitting near Louisiana and Pensacola before moving out to sea. This hurricane caused 105 deaths.\n1838 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. On September 7, a hurricane hit near Cape Florida, causing 38 deaths.\nII. A late season hurricane hit the east coast of Mexico on November 1, sinking 2 U.S. ships.\n1839 Atlantic hurricane season.\nI. A hurricane hit Charleston, South Carolina on August 28. It passed over North Carolina and Virginia before going out to sea on the 30th.\nII. This cyclone is known as Reid's Hurricane. The system moved from east of the West Indies into the southwest Atlantic. Swells were noted as early as September 9 at Bermuda. During late on the September 11 and early on September 12, this hurricane struck Bermuda. The storm tide was measured as 11\u00a0feet/3.3\u00a0meters. Thousands of trees were downed. The tower on Tower Hill was levelled. Damage done to private property totalled 8000 pounds sterling (1839 pounds). This cyclone later swept western Ireland as an extratropical storm, which they called The Great Wind of 1839. This was one of the first hurricanes to be studied by William Reid in person, in this case as governor of the island the year after his publication of \"The Law of Storms\". (from Beware the Hurricane)\nIII. During the middle of September, a hurricane approached the coast of Louisiana. It struck near Lake Charles, then known as Charley's Lake, on September 15.\nIV. A late season hurricane hit Galveston, Texas on November 5."}

Since it was introduced early in the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" anime, it has become one of the most famous Pok\u00e9mon.\nJigglypuff is perhaps most famous for the song it sings which puts everyone who hears it into a deep sleep. Jigglypuff then becomes upset because it assumes everyone is very bored by the song, and it draws all over their faces with a marker.\nJigglypuff is a small Pok\u00e9mon, slightly shorter than Pikachu. It is shaped like a balloon and has a pink body with blue eyes, catlike ears, and a strange tuft of fur on its forehead.\nIn video games.\nIn the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" video games, Jigglypuff is famous among players because it learns the move Sing, which puts enemy Pok\u00e9mon to sleep. This often causes them to lose the battle, and many players find it very annoying.\nJigglypuff was introduced in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", the first \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games. It has appeared in most of the games since then. It evolves into Wigglytuff, an \"upgraded\" form of Jigglypuff. Starting with \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver\", Jigglypuff has a pre-evolved evolutionary form, Igglybuff. Igglybuff was one of the 100 new Pok\u00e9mon introduced in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". Previously there were only 151.\nJigglypuff has also appeared in \"Super Smash Bros.,\" \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", and \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\". It is a light and fast character who is great in the air. Its attacks include Rollout, Pound, Sing, Rest, and its Final Smash, Puff Up.\nIn anime.\nJigglypuff is one of the most famous Pok\u00e9mon, alongside Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Mewtwo, mostly because it has appeared many times in the still-running \"Pok\u00e9mon\" anime. It usually appears unexpectedly and puts Pok\u00e9mon and humans near it to sleep for a few minutes by singing its trademark song. It has a black permanent marker, similar to a Sharpie, with which it often draws on people and Pok\u00e9mon's faces while they are asleep. This is an act of revenge because everyone falls asleep when they hear Jigglypuff's song and Jigglypuff assumes it's because they are very bored by it. Since people are upset when Jigglypuff puts them to sleep, and Jigglypuff is upset when they fall asleep, it is a vicious circle.\nIn episode \"Beach Blank-Out Blastoise\", Jigglypuff somehow got stuck in Blastoise's hydro cannon. When it was finally freed, it put everyone to sleep and then drew on their faces."}

After his father Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah (910-934) seized power in Ifriqiya he was named heir to the throne in 912, and helped put down several revolts. But campaigns into Egypt failed because of the resistance of the Abbasids (914-915 and 919-921).\nIn 934 Al-Qaim succeeded his father as Caliph. The Fatimid realm became an important power in the Mediterranean. After the re-conquest of Sicily the Byzantine province of Calabria and the coast of Italy and France were . \nBut from 944 to 947 there was a crisis by the revolt of Abu Yazid, who had united the Kharijite Berber tribes of eastern Algeria and overrun Ifriqiya.

{"id": "139657", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139657", "title": "Anti-nuclear movement", "text": "Many people who are anti-nuclear, are against the use of nuclear power for electricity generation, since they think nuclear power is dangerous. They consider the risk of a nuclear accident unacceptable and generally believe that radioactive waste cannot be disposed of safely. Many also see uranium mining and nuclear reprocessing as bad, because of the environmental risks of these activities. The 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents have \"revived anti-nuclear passions worldwide, putting governments on the defensive and undermining the nuclear power industry's recent renaissance\".\nIssues.\nAnti-nuclear concerns.\nAnti-nuclear groups believe that nuclear power is a risk to people and the environment. These include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, the unsolved problem of nuclear waste, and the possibility of further serious accidents. Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity.\nOpponents of nuclear energy make connections between the international export and development of nuclear power technologies and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The facilities and expertise to produce nuclear power can be readily adapted to produce nuclear weapons. Greenpeace suggests that nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown up like Siamese twins.\nNuclear power plants are very expensive. Making reliable cost estimates is difficult, and estimates for new reactors in the USA range from $5 billion to $10 billion per unit. Building nuclear plants is seen to be \"a risky business\", according to several notable credit rating agencies and investment analysts.\nNuclear accidents are often cited by anti-nuclear groups as evidence of the inherent danger of nuclear power. The most well-known nuclear accident, a mishandled safety test at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 in Kiev, Ukraine, \"killed at least 4056 people and damaged almost $7 billion of property\". Radioactive fallout from the accident concentrated near Belarus, Ukraine and Russia and at least 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas. After the accident, \"traces of radioactive deposits unique to Chernobyl were found in nearly every country in the northern hemisphere\". Other serious nuclear accidents include the Mayak disaster, Soviet submarine K-431 accident, Soviet submarine K-19 accident, Chalk River accidents, Windscale fire, Church Rock Uranium Mill Spill and the SL-1 accident. The Fukushima nuclear disaster occured in 2011. Clean-up from the Fukushima nuclear disaster is expected to cost over 12 trillion yen ($100 billion) and take 30 to 40 years.\nEspecially since the September 11 attacks, people have become concerned that terrorists or criminals could bomb a nuclear plant and release radioactive material. Building more plants would create more targets to protect.\nThere is an international consensus that spent nuclear fuel should be stored in deep geological disposal sites. However, no country has opened such a site yet. The demise of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada leaves the USA with no plan for the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel.\nNuclear-free alternatives.\nAnti-nuclear groups generally claim that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting energy conservation and energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency can reduce the consumption of energy while providing the same level of energy \"services\".\nAnti-nuclear groups also favour the use of renewable energy, such as wind power, solar power, geothermal energy and biofuel. According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to world energy security and provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases.\nActivities by country.\nAustralia.\nAustralia has no nuclear power stations and the current Gillard Labor government is opposed to nuclear power for Australia, as are the Greens, the party with the current balance of power in the upper house. However, Australia does have a small research reactor (OPAL) in Sydney, and it does export uranium. Australia has 40% of the world's known uranium deposits as well as similar deposits of the other potential fission reactor fuel thorium, and sells uranium to members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nUranium mining and export and nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate, and the anti-nuclear movement in Australia has a long history. It all began with the 1972\u201373 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific, which involved several groups, and the 1976\u201377 debate about uranium mining in Australia.\nFrance.\nIn the 1970s, an anti-nuclear movement in France, consisting of citizens' groups and political action committees, emerged. There were many large anti-nuclear protests and demonstrations. More recently, targeted campaigns have been conducted, mainly by Greenpeace, and Sortir du nucl\u00e9aire (France) has called for an official safety inspection of Areva facilities.\nGermany.\nThe anti-nuclear movement in Germany has a long history dating back to the early 1970s, when large demonstrations prevented the construction of a nuclear plant at Wyhl. Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired nuclear opposition throughout Germany, in other parts of Europe, and in North America.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn January 2008 the UK government announced plans to build new nuclear power stations, and the anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom has voiced concerns. There are also public concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Many different groups and individuals have been involved in demonstrations and protests over the years.\nUnited States.\nFor many years the anti-nuclear movement in the United States succeeded in delaying or halting commitments to build some new nuclear plants. Anti-nuclear campaigns that captured national public attention in the 1970s involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, and the Three Mile Island accident. More recent targeted campaigning has related to the Indian Point Energy Center, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, Salem Nuclear Power Plant, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, Idaho National Laboratory, proposed Yucca Mountain waste repository, the Hanford Site, the Nevada Test Site, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Many different groups have been involved in various protests and demonstrations over the years.\nMore than fifty anti-nuclear groups are operating, or have operated, in the United States. These include: Abalone Alliance, Clamshell Alliance, Greenpeace USA, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Musicians United for Safe Energy, Nevada Desert Experience, Nuclear Control Institute, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, Public Citizen Energy Program, Shad Alliance, and the Sierra Club.\nMany well-known scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power. These people include: Barry Commoner, S. David Freeman, John Gofman, Amory Lovins, Arjun Makhijani, Gregory Minor and Joseph Romm.\nImpact on popular culture.\nBeginning in the 1960s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as \"Fail-Safe\" and feature films such as \"\" (1964), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Silkwood\" (1983), and \"The Rainbow Warrior\" (1992).\nRecent developments.\nOn 21 April 2010, a dozen environmental groups called on the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to investigate possible problems in the AP1000 reactor design.\nOn 24 April 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (KETTENreAKTION!) between the nuclear plants at Kr\u00fcmmel and Brunsb\u00fcttel. In this way they were protesting against the plans of the German government to extend the period of producing nuclear power.\nIn May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched for about two kilometers from downtown New York to a square in front of United Nations headquarters, calling for the end to nuclear weapons.\nIn September 2010, German government policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this created some new anti-nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond. On 18 September 2010, tens of thousands of Germans surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s office in an anti-nuclear demonstration that organisers said was the biggest of its kind since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.\nIn October 2010, tens of thousands of people protested in Munich against the nuclear power policy of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government. The action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in Bavaria for more than two decades.\nIn November 2010, there were violent protests against a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste in Germany. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to the cargo. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests.\nIn December 2010, some 10,000 people (mainly fishermen, farmers and their families) turned out to oppose the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in western Maharashtra state in India, amid a heavy police presence.\nIn December 2010, five anti-nuclear weapons activists, including octogenarians and Jesuit priests, were convicted of conspiracy and trespass in Tacoma, USA. They cut fences at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in 2009 to protest submarine nuclear weapons, and reached an area near where Trident nuclear warheads are stored in bunkers. Members of the group could face up to 10 years in prison when they are sentenced.\nIn January 2011, five Japanese young people held a hunger strike for more than a week, outside the Prefectural Government offices in Yamaguchi, to protest site preparation for the planned Kaminoseki Nuclear Power Plant near the environmentally sensitive Seto Inland Sea.\nAfter the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accidents, anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. On 12 March 2011, 60,000 Germans formed a 45-km human chain from Stuttgart to the Neckarwestheim power plant. On 14 March, 110,000 people protested in 450 other German towns, with opinion polls indicating 80% of Germans opposed the government's extension of nuclear power. On 15 March 2011, Angela Merkel said that seven nuclear power plants which went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier renewable energy commercialization.\nIn March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate end to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to plans to extend the lifespan of three existing nuclear plants.\nIn March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011.\nAfter the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, environmental activists at a U.N. meeting in April 2011 \"urged bolder steps to tap renewable energy so the world doesn't have to choose between the dangers of nuclear power and the ravages of climate change\".\nIn mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power.\nIn India, environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project six-reactor complex, 420\u00a0km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated in the wake of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster and during two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured."}

It was created by Bethesda Game Studios. The game is the third in the \"Fallout\" series of games. It is set in a world where nuclear bombs have ruined the surface and people are fighting to survive. \"Fallout 3\" was released on October 28, 2008 in North America, October 30, 2008 in Australia, and October 31, 2008 in the United Kingdom.\nGameplay.\nThe player controls a character on the screen with two different view points. One point of view is from the character's head and another is from behind the character. The player may make their character different by changing their name, gender, how they look, and using skill points to make their character better at doing certain things. \nThe character may use either close-up weapons, guns or grenades to fight enemies. These need to be repaired in order to stay good. The player can also create weapons using drawings found in the game. There are two modes of fighting. The player may either aim and shoot at enemies or use a special system, called the \"Vault-tec Assisted Targeting System\" (VATS), to attack an enemy's arms and legs. \nThe character has a limited number of Health Points. If these are lost due to damage, the character will die. However, the player can dress their character in armor so that the character takes less damage. The character may also get sick from radiation.\nThe character can also be good or bad, and earns \"Karma points\" for being good and doing nice things or loses Karma points for being mean or killing people who do not deserve it.\nCharacters.\nBecause of the nuclear war the world was radiated very badly. The people who were not safe turned into Ghouls, living zombies. The player also has to fight against Raiders, Super Mutants and animals like radiated cockroachs, scorpions, and vicious dogs.\nMany normal people are alive, though. For example, a city made of airplane parts, \"Megaton\", has normal humans, \"Tenpenny Tower\" has rich people and \"Paradise Falls\" that has slaves and slavers. There is also a city made of Ghouls called \"Underworld\" which is an old museum.\nPlot.\nIn the \"Fallout\" games, the world after 2050 destroyed itself because all the nations bombed each other with nuclear bombs. A few people in the United States hid underground in shelters called \"Vaults\". The player comes from Vault 101 in Washington, D.C. They leave the vault because their father has gone missing.\nThe game does not have a required story as the player can play any missions, called \"quests\", whenever they want. The main story involves the player interacting with what used to be the Army, the Brotherhood of Steel, and the evil Enclave, which used to be the government. The player has to either stop the Enclave's mission to kill all mutant people or help them.\nCreation.\nBlack Isle Studios, a company belonging to Interplay, was making the game. Interplay lost all of its money and sold the game to Bethesda Softworks in July 2004. Bethesda Softworks created a new version of the game. It was supposed to look like Bethesda's game before Fallout, Oblivion, but they made it much bigger. The game now has a 16-square mile game setting. In Australia, the game could not be sold because it talked about real drugs. The programmers renamed the drugs so that it could be sold in Australia.\nReception.\n\"Fallout 3\" has gotten very good reviews. It has a 93% mark at Metacritic and sold 110,000 more copies than another Bethesda Softworks game, ."}

No state can have fewer than three electors. There are 435 representatives in total and 100 senators. The 23rd Amendment to the Constitution awarded Washington, D.C. three electors. Combined, there is a total of 538 electors.\nElectors usually vote for the winner of the popular vote in their state. In some states, they vote depending on the popular vote in each congressional district. The Constitution leaves states to decide how electors will vote. Faithless electors are electors that vote against the popular vote, although there is a fine for this in some states.\nThe Electoral College was created as the Founding Fathers were afraid the popular vote would be easily swayed. Because congressional representatives is determined by population, electors are assigned based on representatives. More populous states have more electors. Because most states have a winner-take-all system, where the winner of the popular vote in a state gains all of the electors, several presidents have lost the popular vote and won the electoral vote. A candidate needs to win a majority of electors, or 270, to become the president-elect.\nThe Electoral College plays a very important role in today's elections. It is the subject of controversy as some people approve of the system, but for various reasons, some don't. The people who approve of the system often argue and say that it give smaller states more power, and that this a good thing, because if it were done by population, someone could win a majority of the votes in certain states but not win the majority of states. The Electoral College favors those who win more states, big and small. Even though it can be won with 11 states, often certain states stay Democratic or Republican ensuring it likely won't happen this way. Those are who against it bring up the latter argument that it can be won with 11 states and that often the candidate who wins does not win the popular vote. Third parties can change the outcome of an election, and it is often debated whether they play a role."}
