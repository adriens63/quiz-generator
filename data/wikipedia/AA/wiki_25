{"id": "53991", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53991", "title": "Viol", "text": "The viol (rhymes with \"mile\") is a string instrument that is played with a bow. The viol was a popular instrument from the 15th to the 18th century. Small viols are held on the lap, and the larger ones are held between the knees, which gave them the name of \"viol da gamba\", meaning a leg viol. The bow is held with the palm of the hand facing upwards: the other way round from today's bowhold for violins, violas or cellos. The viol is a gentle-sounding instrument. When the violin family became popular in the 17th century and people started to go to concerts in large concert halls, and to operas, the viols became less important. They were never used in orchestras.\nDescription.\nViols are made of wood, and are similar to the violin family. Most viols have six strings, although this number did vary during the centuries. The strings were made of gut, and are not as tight as on a violin. The fingerboard has frets like a guitar, except that they were also made of gut. They were tied around the fingerboard, and could be moved for tuning. These frets help the player to find the exact place to put their fingers. Sometimes the top of the scrolls on the fingerboard were beautifully decorated. The instruments have sloped shoulders and a flat back. The viol, like the vihuela, from which it developed, has a bridge that is flatter than the bridge of a modern violin. This makes it easier to play chords. The bow was convex in shape, where a violin bow is concave.\nSizes.\nViols were made in different sizes. A set of viols of different sizes - perhaps four or five instruments - were sometimes kept together in a chest (large box) which is why they were called a \"chest of viols\". When they were played together people talked of a \"consort of viols\". A consort would normally have at least one treble, tenor and bass instrument. A \"broken consort\" meant a mixture of different instruments: viols, recorders etc. Lute and bass viol were often played together. They were tuned in fourths, with a major third in the middle.\nThe strings of a bass viol (equivalent to the cello in the modern violin family) are tuned (from the lowest note, nearly two octaves below middle C, upwards) to D - G - C - E - A -D. The tenor viol was often called a viola da gamba (literally: \"viol of the leg\"). It was the most popular size for solo music and many composers wrote sonatas for the viola da gamba. The biggest viol is called the violone. It developed into the modern double bass. This is why the double bass is a little different in shape from the violin, viola and cello. Some double bass players today hold the bow with the palm (inside) of the hand facing upwards, like viol players.\nHistory.\nThe viol was popular in the houses of rich people, and in the royal court. During the reign of Elizabeth I and, later, King Charles I composers such as William Byrd, John Dowland, Orlando Gibbons, John Jenkins and William Lawes wrote viol music. Solo sonatas were written by many composers including Marin Marais, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Karl Friedrich Abel. Some of the last and greatest fantasies for viol consort were written by Henry Purcell.\nAfter the mid-18th century people forgot about the viol until the 20th century when there was a new interest in early music and people like Arnold Dolmetsch started making them again so that Renaissance and Baroque viol music could be played. Today there are many societies for people who are interested in playing the viol.\nThere are now many societies for people with an interest in the viol. One of these, The Viola da Gamba Society has a worldwide membership. Some modern composers have also written for the viol e.g. John Tavener, Sally Beamish, Thea Musgrave, Tan Dun and Poul Ruders. There is a group called Fretwork which perform viol music."}

The digital form of the HSV color wheel is called the RGB color wheel (shown below). The HSV/RGB color wheel is described below. There are two versions: one in which red, green and blue are regarded as the primary colors (called the \"electronic\" or \"computer\" color wheel); and one in which magenta, yellow, and cyan are regarded as the primary colors (called the \"printer's color wheel\").the primary colours are on the top.\nThe primary colors.\n\"(* Primary means first)\"\nIn the electronic color wheel used for electronic devices such as televisions and computers, red, green, and blue are regarded as the \"primary colors\" and magenta, yellow, and cyan are regarded as the \"secondary colors\". \nThe primary colors always appear on the color wheel. There are the three primary colors of light. These are called the three \"additive colors\". They are red (made in pigment by mixing yellow and magenta), green (made in pigment by mixing cyan and yellow), and blue (made in pigment by mixing magenta and cyan). The three primary colors of light are the secondary colors on the \"printer's color wheel\". \nThe primary colors of light can be mixed together to make secondary colors. A long time ago, people used to think that the primary colors were red, yellow and blue. Now we know they were wrong.\nThe secondary colors.\n\"(* Secondary means second)\"\nThe secondary colors are on all color wheels. Secondary colors are made by mixing the primary colors of light together. The secondary colors of light are the primary colors of pigment on the printer's color wheel--the color wheel used for color printing. These three colors are called the \"subtractive colors\". They are magenta (a bright pink), yellow and cyan (a light greenish blue). The primary colors of light are the secondary colors on the \"printer's color wheel\". The three primary colors of pigment can be mixed to make red (magenta and yellow), green (yellow and cyan), and blue (cyan and magenta), but they do not appear as bright when they are made with pigment instead of light. The secondary colors can be mixed with the primary colors to make tertiary colors.\nThe tertiary colors.\n\"(* Tertiary means third)\" The tertiary colors are made by mixing a secondary and primary color together. The tertiary colors are orange, made by mixing red and yellow; chartreuse green (\"yellow-green\"), made by mixing green and yellow; spring green, made by mixing green and cyan; azure, made by mixing blue and cyan; violet, made by mixing blue and magenta; and rose, made by mixing red and magenta.\nThe tertiary colors are the same for both the \"printer's color wheel\" and the \"electronic color wheel\". \nThe 12 major colors of the color wheel.\nThe 12 major colors of the color wheel, at 30 degree intervals on the \"HSV color wheel\" (shown above), are the following: red (0 degrees or 360 degrees), orange (30 degrees), yellow (60 degrees), chartreuse green (90 degrees), green (120 degrees), spring green (150 degrees), cyan (180 degrees), azure (210 degrees), blue (240 degrees), violet (270 degrees), magenta (300 degrees), and rose (330 degrees).

{"id": "54082", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54082", "title": "Scottish Premier League", "text": "Competition format.\nLeague.\nThe SPL is in a league format \u2013 a team gains points by playing another team in the league. Three points are awarded for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Once all the games have been played, the team at the top of the league wins the SPL trophy. If two or more teams are equal on points, then the difference between of goals scored and goals against is considered. The season runs from August until May each year. Each club will play each other at least three times before the table splits in half for the last part of the competition. Each club will then play five more games against clubs in their half of the table. Each team plays a total of 38 games.\nSplit.\nOnce every team has played each other three times the league splits into two halves for another five games. This means that the top six teams play each other once, and the bottom six teams play each other once. Many people do not like the SPL splitting. Many managers such as Jim Jeffries, the manager of Hearts at the time, has publicly asked for the split to be removed. The man in charge of the SPL, the Chief Executive, said that 11 out of the 12 SPL teams would need to agree and out of eight teams asked, five said that they wanted the split kept.\nTeams cannot move between the two splits, meaning that even if a team in seventh place has more points than the team in sixth they will not move above them in the league. This happens often, for example in the 2005\u201306 season, the seventh placed club, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, gained more points than the fourth placed club, Hibernian but finished the league in seventh.\nWinter break.\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, the SPL decided to stop the \"winter break\", forcing teams to play through January. This means that many games are stopped because of the damage to the pitch and very bad weather. Former Celtic manager Martin O'Neill, former Dundee manager Jim Duffy, and former Rangers manager Walter Smith are among those who have asked to start the winter break again. Former Rangers manager Alex McLeish accused the SPL of taking Scottish football \"back to the Dark Ages\" after its decision to stop the winter break, meaning that they were going back to an old, outdated system.\nEuropean qualification.\nA total of four clubs can qualify for European competitions. The teams who finish first in the SPL qualify for the UEFA Champions League. The second and third-placed team, and the winner of the Scottish Cup, qualify for the UEFA Europa League.\nRangers and Celtic have recently played in the final of the UEFA Cup, with neither club winning in the final match. In 2003 Celtic played FC Porto in Seville, Spain but Porto won 3\u2013 2. More recently, in 2008 Rangers played FC Zenit St. Petersburg in Manchester, England, but lost 2\u2013 0. More than 200,000 Rangers fans went to Manchester to watch the game on several large televisions.\nPromotion and relegation.\nNormally, the team who finishes last in the SPL is relegated to the Scottish First Division and the team who finishes first in the First Division is promoted to the SPL. However, there are some criteria that the team must meet in order to be promoted. In 2003, Falkirk finished first in the Scottish First Division but their stadium did not meet the agreed criteria. Instead, they asked if they could share a stadium with Airdrie United while their own stadium was expanded. This caused arguments as the chairmen of the SPL clubs voted against this idea. Because Falkirk's stadium was too small, they were not promoted into the SPL, and the team who finished last in the SPL (Motherwell) was not relegated.\nThis situation almost happened again in 2004. There were many votes and threats of legal action from Partick Thistle, the team who finished last in the SPL. The situation was solved and Inverness Caledonian Thistle were allowed promotion, as long as they shared a stadium with their rivals Aberdeen at Pittodrie, a stadium over 100\u00a0miles (160\u00a0km) away.\nIn 2005, the stadium size criteria was reduced. A team playing in the SPL must now have at least 6,000 seats (down from 10,000). Standing room is not allowed in SPL grounds for safety reasons. This then allowed Inverness Caledonian Thistle to return to their home stadium during the 2005\u201306 season.\nPlayers.\nIn the SPL, there are no restrictions on clubs signing players. The only rule on signing players is with general Scottish employment law. There are no salary caps or age restrictions. There are no restrictions on the size of the playing squad or restrictions on the number of players from other countries.\nThe only rule is the \"Under-21\" rule. This means that every club must name at least three players under the age of 21 in their match day squad. They do not need to play. There has been some criticism over this rule. Walter Smith, Gus MacPherson and Jim Jeffries all showed their disapproval.\nMedia coverage and sponsorship.\nTelevision coverage.\nBetween the 1998\u201399 season and the 2001\u201302 season, the right to show SPL matches on television was held by Sky Sports, with highlights being shown by STV's Scotsport. Sky Sports withdrew from the SPL when their offer for \u00a345 million, to continue showing live games on TV, was declined by the SPL. The SPL asked for more money. Discussions began in 2002 for a new pay-per-view satellite television channel, called \"SPL TV\". However Rangers and Celtic did not like the idea, and rejected it. Because of this, the remaining 10 SPL clubs announced their intention to resign from the league.\nEven though a two-year television deal had been agreed with BBC Scotland in July 2002 (for less than the money previously offered by Sky Sports), the 10 non-Old Firm clubs confirmed their resignation from the SPL in August 2002, because they were unhappy with how the league voted which allowed the Old Firm clubs to stop any attempts to change SPL rules. The ten clubs withdrew their resignations in January 2003 after an agreement was reached to change the voting rules and to change the way the money from TV was given out to the SPL teams.\nWith BBC Scotland's television contract due to expire after the 2003\u201304 season, the SPL agreed a new television deal with Irish company Setanta Sports in February 2004 in a four-year deal worth \u00a354 million. In June 2008, it was announced that a further four-year deal would start for the 2010\u201311 season, with the deal worth \u00a3125 million. However, Setanta went bankrupt in June 2009. In July, Sky Sports and ESPN agreed a \u00a365 million five-year deal with the SPL.\nRadio.\nThe right to broadcast SPL games on radio is currently held by BBC Radio Scotland, who have held the rights since the SPL started in the 1998\u201399 season. BBC Radio Scotland also provide internet webcasts to all Scottish Premier League matches, having became the first broadcaster to introduce such a service in June 2000.\nSponsorship.\nAs with many sport competitions, the name of the SPL has been sold to a sponsor, currently the Clydesdale Bank, a Scottish Bank. The Clydesdale Bank bought the name in the 2007\u201308 season for \u00a38 million, taking over from another Scottish bank, the Bank Of Scotland. The SPL is now known as the \"Clydesdale Bank Premier League\".\nTeams.\nOld Firm.\nUntil the start of the 2012-13 season the two Glasgow football clubs known as the Old Firm played in the SPL, Rangers and Celtic. The Old Firm was criticised by some due to the fact that they held such a strong position in Scottish football. The amount of money they made was very large compared to the other teams in Scotland. In 2001 their income was \u00a390 million, almost double the income of the other ten teams, whose income was \u00a348 million combined. Every year since the SPL started one of the Old Firm has won the league. Only once, in the 2005\u201306 season, did the Old Firm clubs not come first and second in the SPL.\nRangers entered administration in 2012 because they owed money which they could not afford to repay. Some of this money was owed to HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) as Rangers had not paid the tax they should have.

This is different from a system where local government functions are divided between different authorities.\nTypically unitary authorities cover large towns or cities, which are large enough to be independent of county or regional administration. Sometimes they consist of counties which have no lower level of administration.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Unitary Authorities\" are English councils which are responsible for almost all local government functions within their areas.\nThis is opposed to the system of local government which still exists in most of England, where local government functions are divided between county councils and district councils.\nUntil 1996 a similar system existed in Scotland and Wales but this has now been replaced by a fully unitary system. The unitary system has existed in Northern Ireland since 1973. when the administrative responsibilities of the were replaced by a system of 26 unitary authorities.\nEngland.\nSome cities, large towns and groups of neighbouring towns are unitary authorities and independent from county councils and some English counties, such as Rutland, Herefordshire and the Isle of Wight, have so small populations that the entire county is a unitary authority.\nIn practice most unitary authorities in the UK are not entirely unitary, as they often run some services on a joint basis with other authorities, these typically include policing, fire services, and sometimes waste disposal and public transport. In addition some unitary authorities contain civil parishes, which effectively form another limited of local government\nWhen the metropolitan councils were abolished in 1986 their functions were given to the boroughs. These became unitary authorities in all but name.\nOther countries.\nSimilar institituions exist in other countries, which although not called unitary authorities, are similar in concept.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States an Independent city or a consolidated city-county is roughly equivalent to a unitary authority. The city might be separate from any county government, as in Virginia, or merged with a county government, as in San Francisco, California, or as is common in Florida. Another type of local government that is roughly equivalent to a unitary authority is a county when there are no municipal or township governments in the county. That is the case in Arlington County, Virginia, and Baltimore County, Maryland.\nCanada.\nUnitary authorities or \"single-tier municipalities\" exist as a single level of government in a province that otherwise has two levels of local government. One should not confuse municipalities in provinces with no upper-level of local government as single-tier municipalities, as these are the \"only\" level of local government in that province.\nGermany.\nIn Germany a kreisfreie Stadt is the equivalent term for a city which is responsible for the local and the Kreis (district) administrative level."}

He is played by Johnny Depp.\nSparrow had been captain of the \"Black Pearl\" before his first mate, Hector Barbossa led a mutiny and took over. Sparrow was left alone on a small island with nothing but a gun, one bullet, and a bottle of rum. The crew thought he would either die of thirst or shoot himself. When they returned expecting to find him dead, Sparrow was gone. No one knew how he did it and many amazing stories grew around their former captain. In reality, the island was used by smugglers to hide their illegal rum. When the smugglers returned, Sparrow left the island on their ship.\nSparrow assembles a crew to help him reclaim the \"Black Pearl\". After the curse is lifted from the crew of the \"Black Pearl\", he kills Barbossa with the same gun he was left with on the island. He becomes captain of the \"Black Pearl\" again.\nElizabeth Swann.\nElizabeth Swann is the daughter of Weatherby Swann, Governor of Port Royal. She is played by Keira Knightley.\nElizabeth loves Will Turner but accepts James Norrington's marriage proposal to save Turner. The marriage is called off after Will is rescued. She marries Will Turner and they have a son, Henry. After Elizabeth gives birth, William is forced to go to sea for ten years. He is reunited with his family in \"At World's End\", but only for one day due to a curse.\nThis curse is broken when Poseidon's Trident is destroyed at the end of \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\" allowing Will to reunite with Elizabeth and their son Henry.\nHector Barbossa.\nCaptain Hector Barbossa is an evil and murderous pirate and arch-rival of Jack Sparrow. He is played by Geoffrey Rush.\nBarbossa was Jack Sparrow's first mate but led a mutiny and became captain of the \"Black Pearl\". He leaves Sparrow on a deserted island to die but Sparrow managed to escape. Barbossa and the crew are cursed to not die but also not to feel any pleasure after they steal a chest of Aztec gold. Just as the curse is lifted, Jack Sparrow shoots Barbossa (using the bullet from the gun left with him when he was marooned). This shot kills Barbossa. However, he is brought back to life by Tia Dalma to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker.\nBarbossa was brought back to free Tia Dalma, not to rescue Jack Sparrow. Tia Dalma was actually in the process of reviving Barbossa when Jack showed up and traded the cursed monkey for a jar of dirt to ward off Davy Jones. Jack had not finished in Davy Jones's Locker yet when she started to revive Barbossa. This could also be Tia Dalma's reason for helping the others rescue Jack without charging them.\nIn the fourth film, he acts as a privateer to get his revenge on Blackbeard for stealing the Black Pearl.\nIn the fifth film, he became a rich pirate and helps Jack to find the Trident. During the adventure, he reunites with his illegitimate daughter Carina and ends up redeeming himself by sacrificing himself to save her and the others from Salazar which leads to his death.\nWill Turner.\nWilliam \"Will\" Turner is a blacksmith and self-taught swordsman who lives in Port Royal. He is played by Orlando Bloom.\nWill was found holding on to a piece of wood at sea as a boy and rescued by a ship traveling to Port Royal. He falls in love with Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter, and wants to marry her. However, because she is rich and he is poor, it does not seem possible. When Elizabeth is taken by Barbossa, Will teams up with Jack Sparrow to rescue her. Sparrow tells Will that Will's father, Bootstrap Turner was one of his crew on the \"Black Pearl\". Bootstrap Turner was the only one on the crew who did not want to mutiny against Sparrow.\nWill finally marries Elizabeth in \"At World's End.\" They have a son, Henry. However, Will is made captain of the \"Flying Dutchman\", and is only allowed to return to port every ten years.\nJames Norrington.\nJames Norrington is a British Royal Navy Officer. He is played by Jack Davenport.\nJames Norrington is a commodore in the Royal Navy. He is in love with Elizabeth Swann and she accepts his proposal to rescue Will.\nAfter Jack Sparrow escapes hanging on the gallows, Norrington gives him a day's head start to let him escape. This causes him to lose his commission and position in the Royal Navy. He goes to Tortuga, a private port where many pirates and criminals live. However, he redeems himself by stealing the heart of Davy Jones and giving it to Lord Beckett. However, he regrets this decision as Beckett begins executing all pirates.\nJames Norrington was killed by Bootstrap Bill Turner on board the \"Flying Dutchman\" after helping Elizabeth and her crew escapes the ship's brig.\nLord Cutler Beckett.\nLord Cutler Beckett is a ruthless lord of the East India Trading Company and he was an officer at the royal navy. He is played Tom Hollander.\nAfter gaining the heart of Davy Jones from James Norrington, Beckett uses it to control Davy Jones by taking over the ship and ordering a mass execution of all pirates, women, and children.\nHe has killed aboard the ship the \"Endeavor\". He loses his control of Davy Jones after Will Turner stabs the heart of Davy Jones and becomes the captain of the \"Flying Dutchman\". The \"Endeavor\" is destroyed by the \"Black Pearl\" and the \"Flying Dutchman\", killing almost all on board, including Beckett.\nTia Dalma.\nTia Dalma is the human form of the goddess Calypso. She is played by Naomie Harris.\nLittle is known about Tia Dalma. She once had a relationship with Jack Sparrow when they were \"inseparable\". It was in this time when she gave Sparrow his compass. She was also Davy Jones' lover at one point. She was the one who turned him into a monster after he cut his heart out for her.\nShe is revealed to be the nymph Calypso, bound to human form by the Brethren Court.\nDavy Jones.\nDavy Jones is captain of the \"Flying Dutchman\" and the sworn enemy of Jack Sparrow. He is played by Bill Nighy through the movie and he's the overall main antagonist of the series.\nDavy Jones turned into a monster after he cut his heart out for Calypso. He is the captain of the \"Flying Dutchman\", a ship crewed by those offered a second chance at life for a hundred years. Their job is to ferry souls to the afterlife. However, Davy Jones uses the crew for his own purposes. This has caused him and the crew to transform into monsters resembling sea life.\nDavy Jones was killed by Will Turner aboard the \"Flying Dutchman\".Will was stabbed by Davy Jones and then Bootstrap charged at Davey Jones and attacked him. But when Davey Jones got a grip on him he took out his sword and was going to stab Bootstrap just as Jack sparrow took the heart out of the chest and helped Will stab it with a broken sword. \nHowever, he was accidentally resurrected when they broke the Trident of Poseidon allowing Jones to return and to search for revenge.\nDavy Jones did not cut his heart out \"for\" Calypso. He cut his heart out \"after\" she betrayed him by not showing up the day Davy Jones was allowed to make port. He was so hurt that he cut out his own heart so he would never have feelings ever again. This is also the reason Davy Jones taught the Brethren Court how to bind Calypso in a human form.\nSao Feng.\nSao Feng is a Pirate Lord of the Brethren Court. He was played by Chow Yun-Fat.\nSao Feng is the pirate lord of the South China Sea. He is known for betraying anyone, even his friends, to get on the winning side.

Feng is suspicious and informs them that earlier that day someone broke into his uncle's temple and attempted to steal the navigational charts to World's End. He reveals the thief to be Will Turner. Barbossa and Elizabeth deny knowing Will, but when Feng threatens to kill him, Elizabeth reacts, confirming they are allies. Barbossa explains that the Brethren Court has been summoned to meet at Shipwreck Cove and Feng, being one of the nine Pirate Lords, is honor-bound to attend. Feng demands to know why they want to sail to the Locker. When Will admits they want to rescue Jack, Feng becomes angry and declares that he would only bring Sparrow back to life to kill him in person. Barbossa reminds Feng that Jack is one of the nine Pirate Lords and is still in possession of a \"piece of eight,\" a pirate lord's symbol, and didn't have a successor to give it to before his \"death\".\nOther characters.\nJoshamee Gibbs.\nJoshamee Gibbs, known as Mr. Gibbs, is a pirate. He is played by Kevin McNally.\nMr. Gibbs is the right-hand man to Jack Sparrow. He helps Jack Sparrow assemble a crew to go after the \"Black Pearl\". He is very superstitious.

Pintel is played by Lee Arenburg, and Ragetti is played by Mackenzie Crook.\nPintel and Ragetti were part of the crew on the \"Black Pearl\".

They often are comic relief in the movies.\nBootstrap Bill Turner.\nBill Turner, often called Bootstrap, is a pirate played by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd.\nBootstrap is Will Turner's father. He was part of the crew of the \"Black Pearl\" with Jack Sparrow as captain, but he did not take part in the mutiny. After stealing the Aztec gold (meaning he was cursed, and immortal) Bootstrap felt bad for the part he played in the mutiny against Jack. He stuck up for Jack, so Barbossa strapped him to a cannon and sent him to the depths, unable to breathe yet unable to die (as said by Bootstrap himself in Dead Man's Chest). Davy Jones offered him a way out of his eternal torture, and Bootstrap Bill accepted. Thus he becomes part of the crew on the \"Flying Dutchman\" with Davy Jones. He also chose to be on the ship with his son William Turner after agreeing to leave every ten years to give his wife and his son a visit.\nThe Kraken.\nThe Kraken is a fictional sea monster. It is based on the mythical beast in mythology (extremely redundant). It is a sea monster that does the bidding of Davy Jones. When summoned by him, it arises from the ocean.

{"id": "54129", "revid": "821431", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54129", "title": "Little Red Riding Hood", "text": "\"Little Red Riding Hood\" (or \"Little Red Cap\") is a French fairy tale for young children about a young girl and a wolf. The story comes from a folktale which means that it was a \"spoken\" story for a long time before it was a written story. It was first written down in the late 1600s, by Charles Perrault. The best-known version (the way the story is told) is \"\" by the Brothers Grimm and dates from the 19th century (1800s).\nStory.\nThe most famous version of the story is the one written by the Brothers Grimm in the 19th century. The Brothers Grimm listened to many traditional stories from old people and wrote them into a book. They did not originally mean for their book to be read as children's stories; they were writing down German folklore for scholars to read. But their book became famous as a book of children's stories anyway. The title of the story is properly translated as \"Little Red Cap\" even though it is usually known in English as \"Little Red Riding Hood\".\nA girl has been given red cap (or cloak and hood) to wear. Her mother sends her to take food to her sick grandmother. The mother tells her she must not stop on the way. A wolf sees the girl walking through the woods and makes a plan to eat her. The wolf politely asks the girl where she is going. The girl answers him, because he seems friendly. The wolf tells the girl to pick some flowers for her grandmother. While she is picking flowers, the wolf goes to grandmother's house and eats her. He puts on the grandmother's night-cap and gets into her bed. When the girl arrives at her grandmother's house, she gets into bed with the wolf.\nIn the Perrault version, the girl is surprised to see what her \"grandmother\" looks like without her clothes. \"What big eyes you have!\" she cries. \"The better to see you with!\" the wolf responds. The dialogue continues, with the child remarking upon other body parts until she notes the wolf's big teeth. \"What big teeth you have!\" she cries. \"The better to eat you with!\" the wolf responds.\nThe wolf leaps upon the child and eats the girl. In the Grimms' version, a woodcutter (lumberjack) comes and cuts open the wolf's body. He saves the grandmother and the girl who are still alive in the wolf's stomach. Then, stones are put in the wolf's body to kill the wolf.\nHistory of the story.\nThe story of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" seems to have been told for centuries in different countries, under different names. \nAnthropoligist Dr. Jamie Tehrani said some versions of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" are 3000 years old. One of Aesop's Fables is a version of \"Little Red Riding Hood\", according to Tehrani. In France, the story has probably been told for at least 700 years. In Italy, there are several versions. One is called \"The False Grandmother\". There is also a story from China which is like this, called \"The Grandmother Tiger\". There are also versions of the story from the Middle East and Africa.\nIn the old versions of the story the wolf is sometimes a terrible monster or a werewolf. In one version of the story, the wolf gives the girl some food to eat. It is part of the body of her grandmother. The wolf tells the girl to throw all her clothes in the fire, and get into bed. She says that she needs to use the toilet first. The wolf ties her with a long string so that she cannot run away without him knowing. But the girl puts the rope around something else, and escapes.\nIn these early versions of the story, Red Riding Hood escapes on her own. She uses her own intelligence and her own courage. The Brothers Grimm and other later authors added male heroes who save Red Riding Hood. \nCharles Perrault.\nThe story was first written and published in a book from 1697 by the French writer Charles Perrault. The name of the book, in English, is \"Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals: Tales of Mother Goose\". The story is called \"The Little Red Cap\" (\"Le Petit Chaperon Rouge\"). Perrault's version of the tale is the original printed version, but it is likely based on an older oral tradition. It is uncertain if Perrault knew a folk tale from the south of France about a girl who cleverly escapes a werewolf occupying her grandmother's bed.\nPerrault wanted to make a strong point about wise and foolish behaviour. He wanted to show that a beautiful young woman was in danger of having men with bad morals try to trick her into wrong behaviour. In Perrault's story the girl is eaten and there is no happy ending.\nOther versions.\nThe story has been changed many times in the centuries following its publication. It is a little different from the way that the Brothers Grimm tell it. In their version, a huntsman slays the child-devouring wolf. He then frees the heroine from the animal's stomach.\nIn some modern versions of the story, especially versions for very young children, the grandmother does not die. She hides in the closet or cupboard instead. \nTelling the story for young children.\nLittle Red Riding Hood often appears as a picture book or in collections of stories for very young children.\nAn important part of the story is the questions and answers. In the story, the wolf knocks at the grandmother's door.\nThe story goes: \nThe second section of repeating parts of the story happens when Red Riding Hood sees the wolf in her grandmother's bed. \nThese questions and answers also appear in older versions, for example Perrault's.\nStories with some of the same ideas.\nThere are many stories in which a hungry wolf threatens a young person or animal. In most of these stories, the young one escapes by cunning (cleverness). One story is the Russian folktale \"Peter and the Wolf\". The Brothers Grimm told the story of the \"Little Kids and the Wolf\". Another story like this is \"The Three Little Pigs\", first published by James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps.\nMeanings.\nAs with many fairy tales, hidden messages can be found in \"Little Red Riding Hood\". People have very different \"interpretations\" (ways of understanding the hidden meanings). There are two well-known ways that the story of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" can be interpreted.\nThe first type of interpretation is about morality. It is about what is right and what is wrong. \nThe second way of seeing the stories has nothing to do with peoples' behaviour or feelings. These interpretations have to do with the cycle of the sun and the seasons, and with the cycle of life, with people dying and being born.\nAdaptations.\nOther re-tellings.\nFran\u00e7ois Adrien Boieldieu (1775 - 1834) made an opera from the story. The opera is called \"Le petit chaperon rouge\". Its first performance was in Paris, in the year 1818.\nIn 1927, Sir Compton MacKenzie used Little Red Riding Hood as the central character of a novel for children \"Santa Claus in Summer\". Red Riding Hood, in this re-telling, is the daughter of a highway man called Riding Hood.\nThe story has been adapted to various media. Tex Avery made a cartoon out of it, Red Hot Riding Hood. He adapted the story to be more appealing to adults. Little Red Riding Hood works at a striptease club. The wolf, dressed in a suit, goes after the stripper (a stripper is a person who is paid to take off his or her clothes in public).\nRoald Dahl re-told the story in a funny poem about Little Red Riding Hood. It is in his collection \"Revolting Rhymes\".\n\"Lon Po Po\" is an ancient Chinese version of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" which won the 1990 Randolph Caldecott Medal for its watercolour and pastel illustrations by Young.\nArt.\nMany paintings have been done of \"Little Red Riding Hood\". Artists who have painted pictures of this story are George Frederick Watts, Samuel Albrecht Anker, and Fran\u00e7ois Richard Fleury."}

{"id": "54185", "revid": "7216654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54185", "title": "Demonym", "text": "A demonym or gentilic is a word used for people or the inhabitants of a place. The name of a people's language is usually the same as this word, for example, the \"English\" (language or people). Some places may not have a word for the people that live there.\nSuffix demonyms.\nThe English language has many ways to create demonyms. The most common is to add a suffix to the end of the location's name. These may use Latin, Semitic or Germanic suffixes, such as:\nIrregular forms.\nIn many cases, both the location's name and the demonym are created by using a suffix, for example \"England\" and \"English\" and \"Englishman\". This is not always true, for example, \"France\" \u2192 \"French; Philippines \u2192 Filipino or Pilipino.\"\nIn a few cases, the name of the country is not at all related to the name of the people (\"Netherlands\" \u2192 \"Dutch\"). This is usually because the two words come from different languages. The demonyms in federal states or autonomous region can also differ in this way. For example, people in Khatumo State are often called \"reer darawiish\". Thats because the dominant tribe Dhulbahante used to be anti-colonial dervishes.&lt;br&gt;Reer Darawiish\"\nDemonyms can be nouns or adjectives. In many cases the noun and adjective forms are the same (\"Canadian/Canadian\"); in other cases they are different (\"Spaniard/Spanish\").\nIn the case of Canadian provinces and territories and U.S. states, demonyms are not usually used as adjectives.\nCultural problems.\nSome peoples, mainly cultures that were taken over by European colonists, have no demonym. They may also have a demonym that is the same as the name of their nation. Examples include Iroquois, Aztec, M\u0101ori, and Czech. Often, the \"native\" languages of these people have forms that did not get used in English. In Czech, for example, the language is \"\u010ce\u0161tina\", the nation is \"\u010cesko\" or \"\u010cesk\u00e1 republika\", and the people are \"\u010ce\u0161i\".\nThe demonym for people of the United States of America has a similar problem. \"American\" can mean either someone from the United States, or someone from any part of American region or the two American continents (North America and South America). \"United Statian\" is not frequently used in English, but it exists. It is commonly used in Spanish (\"estadounidense\") and widely used in Latin American Spanish. French (\"\u00e9tatsunien(ne)\") exists but is rarely used, Portuguese (\"estado-unidense\" or \"estadunidense\") but it is not as commonly used, Italian (\"statunitense\") exists but is rarely used, and also in Interlingua (\"statounitese\"). In Esperanto the country is \"Usono\" and the demonym is \"Usonano\", avoiding confusion with \"Amerikano\". \"US American\" (for the noun) and \"US-American\" can be used but is not widely used in German (\"US-Amerikaner\")."}

{"id": "54213", "revid": "212856", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54213", "title": "Gettysburg Address", "text": " \nThe Gettysburg Address is a speech by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. It was delivered on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863. This speech was made during the American Civil War, at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. This was four-and-a-half months after the Union Army had a victory over the Confederate States Army at the Battle of Gettysburg.\nThe address is one of the greatest speeches in the history of the United States. Lincoln spoke of how humans were equal as it has been said in the Declaration of Independence. He also said the Civil War was a fight not simply for the Union, but \"a new birth of freedom\" that would make everyone truly equal in one united nation.\nThe speech famously begins with \"Four score and seven years ago\", referring to the American Revolution in 1776. \"Score\" in this case is an old word meaning \"twenty.\" Lincoln used the ceremony at Gettysburg to encourage the people to help America's democracy, so that the \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\".\nThe speech is very important in the popular culture of the United States. However, people are not sure about the exact words of the speech. The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address are different from one another in some details. They are also different from the words of the Gettysburg Address that have been printed in modern newspapers.\nBackground.\nAbout 172,000 American soldiers fought in the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1\u20133, 1863. The Battle of Gettysburg was an important influence on the American Civil War and on the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where only 2,400 people lived. The battlefield had more than 7,500 bodies of dead soldiers and 5,000 horses. Sarah Broadhead, a wife and mother living in the town, feared that they would \"be visited with pestilence\". Eliza Farnham, a nurse, called the place \"one vast hospital\". An army medical officer spoke similarly: \" days following the battle of Gettysburg greatest amount of human suffering known in this nation since its birth\".\nThe people of Gettysburg wanted to bury the dead properly. At first, they planned to buy land for a cemetery and ask the families of the dead to pay for the burial. However, David Willis, a rich 32-year-old lawyer, did not like this idea. He wrote to the Governor of Pennsylvania, Andrew Gregg Curtin, asking that a National Cemetery be supported by the states. Wills was allowed to buy 17\u00a0acres (69,000\u00a0m\u00b2) for a cemetery to honor the people who died in the battle. He paid $2,475.87 for the land.\nAt first, Wills wanted to dedicate this new cemetery on Wednesday, October 23. He asked Edward Everett to be the main speaker. Everett was a very famous orator at that time. He had also served as Secretary of State, U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative, Governor of Massachusetts, president of Harvard University, and Vice Presidential candidate. However, Everett replied that he would not be able to prepare a good speech so quickly, and wanted to move the date of the dedication. The organizing committee agreed, and the dedication was moved to Thursday, November 19.\nWills and the event committee then asked President Lincoln to join in the ceremony. Wills' letter said, \"It is the desire , as Chief Executive of the nation, formally (officially) set apart these a few appropriate (proper) remarks\". Lincoln was officially asked to join only 17 days before the ceremony, while Everett had received his invitation 40 days earlier. \"Although there is some evidence Lincoln expected Wills's letter, its late date makes the author (writer) appear days was extraordinarily (remarkably) short notice for presidential participation even by nineteenth-century standards\". Also, Wills's letter \"made it equally clear to the president that he would have only a small part in the ceremonies\".\nLincoln came by train to Gettysburg on November 18. He spent the night in Wills's house on the Gettysburg town square. There, he finished the speech he had written in Washington, D.C. There is a popular story that Lincoln completed his address on the train on the back of an envelope, but it is not true. There are several early copies on Executive Mansion paper, and reports of Lincoln finishing his speech while he was a guest of David Wills at Gettysburg. On the morning of November 19 at 9:30\u00a0a.m., Lincoln, riding a brown horse, joined the townspeople, and widows marching out to the grounds to be dedicated.\nAbout 15,000 people went to the ceremony. This included the governors of six of the 24 Union states. They were Andrew Gregg Curtin of Pennsylvania, Augustus Bradford of Maryland, Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, Horatio Seymour of New York, Joel Parker of New Jersey, and David Tod of Ohio. Canadian politician William McDougall came as Lincoln's guest. Historians do not agree about the exact place where the dedication ceremony was held inside the cemetery. Moving all the bodies to the graves in the cemetery was less than half complete on the day of the ceremony.\nPolitical importance.\nBy August 1863, millions of people had been killed or injured because of Civil War battles. This made people in the North begin to dislike Lincoln and the war. Lincoln's 1863 drafts were not popular, and people became angriest with them around the time of the New York Draft Riots. This was just ten days after the Battle of Gettysburg. In September 1863, Pennsylvania's Governor Curtin told Lincoln that people were turning against the war effort:\nIf the election were to occur now, the result would be extremely doubtful (not sure), and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result, my impression is, the chances would be against us. The draft is very odious in the State... the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion, and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent, and the changes are against us.\nIn the summer of 1864, Lincoln was worried that the people's bad feelings would make him lose the Presidential election. In the fall of 1863, he grew very concerned about keeping up the Union's spirits toward the war effort. That was the greatest purpose of Lincoln's Address at Gettysburg.\nProgram and Everett's \"Gettysburg Oration\".\nThe program organized for that day by Wills and his committee included:\nLincoln's short speech became known in history as one of the best examples of English public speeches. Everett's two-hour oration was called the \"Gettysburg address\" that day, but his oration is not well-known today. It began:\nIt ended two hours later with:\nText of Gettysburg Address.\nAfter Everett finished his speech, Lincoln spoke for two or three minutes. Lincoln's \"few appropriate remarks\" summarized the war in ten sentences.\nLincoln's speech is very important in history, but modern scholars do not agree about the words of the speech. There are many different modern versions printed in newspaper accounts of the event. Among these, the Bliss version, written some time after the speech for a friend, is seen by lots of people as the most reliable text. Its text is different, however, from the written versions prepared by Lincoln before and after his speech. It is the only version Lincoln put his signature on. It is also the last he is known to have written.\nLincoln's sources.\nIn \"Lincoln at Gettysburg\", Garry Wills notes the similarity between Lincoln's speech and Pericles's Funeral Oration during the Peloponnesian War (James McPherson and Gore Vidal also note this). Pericles' speech begins with remembering honored people: \"I shall begin with our ancestors: it is both just and proper that they should have the honour of the first mention on an occasion like the present\". This is very much like the Gettysburg Address's famous beginning. In the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln had begun by speaking of how \"our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation\". He then praises their State's firm democracy: \"If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all\". He honors the dead's sacrifice: \"Thus choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonour, but met danger face to face\". He also warmly encourages the living to continue to fight for true democracy: \"You, their survivors, must determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you may pray that it may have a happier issue\".\nBut writer Adam Gopnik felt differently. In \"The New Yorker\", he said that Everett's Oration was openly neoclassical. For example, Everett spoke directly about Marathon and Pericles. But he said that \"Lincoln\u2019s rhetoric is, instead, deliberately Biblical\". He added that it is hard to find any obviously classical references in all of his speeches. Gopnik felt that \"Lincoln had mastered the sound of the King James Bible so completely that he could recast (make again) abstract issues of constitutional law in Biblical terms (words from the Bible), making the proposition (suggestion) that Texas and New Hampshire should be forever bound by a single post office sound like something right out of Genesis\".\nThere are many theories about where Lincoln's expression of \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\" came from. In \"The American Monthly Review of Reviews\", it is suggested that the writings of William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, much influenced Lincoln. William Herndon wrote in \"Abraham Lincoln: The True Story of A Great Life\" that he had brought some of the sermons of abolitionist minister Theodore Parker to Lincoln, who had been moved by them.\nCraig R. Smith, In \"Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity\", suggested that the Gettysburg Address was influenced by the speech of Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster. In his \"Second Reply to Hayne\", Webster had famously cried out, \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable\"! In this 1830 speech, Webster had also described the Federal Government as \"made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people\". This expression was very similar to Lincoln's \"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\" Webster also said, \"This the independent offspring of the popular will. It is not the creature of State the whole truth must be told, the people brought it into existence, established it, and have hitherto (until now) supported it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties\".\nWills was interested in how Lincoln used the ideas of birth, life, and death. Lincoln had described the nation as \"brought forth\", \"conceived\", and that shall not \"perish\". Others, such as Allen C. Guelzo, suggested that Lincoln's expression \"four score and seven\" was about the King James Version of the Bible's . There, man's life is described as \"threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years\".\nFive manuscripts.\nEach of the five manuscript copies of the Gettysburg Address are named for the person who received it from Lincoln. Lincoln gave a copy to each of his private secretaries, John Nicolay and John Hay. Both were written around the time of his November 19 address. The other three copies of the address (the Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss copies) were written a long time after November 19. They were written by Lincoln for charitable purposes. The Bliss copy has become the most widely accepted text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. This is partly because Lincoln gave it a title and signed and dated it.\nThere has been some controversy about the two earliest drafts of the Address. Lincoln's son, Robert Todd Lincoln, made Nicolay and Hay the legal guardians of Lincoln's papers in 1874. The Nicolay Copy appeared as a copy in an article written by Nicolay in 1894. After that, it was thought to be among the papers passed to Hay by Nicolay's daughter Helen when Nicolay died in 1901. Robert Lincoln began a search for the first copy in 1908. He discovered a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address among the papers of John Hay\u2014a copy now known as the \"Hay Draft\".\nThe Hay Draft was different from the Gettysburg Address printed by Nicolay in 1894 in many important ways. For example, it was written on a different kind of paper, had a different number of words on every line, had a different number of lines, and had corrections in Lincoln's handwriting.\nBoth the Hay and Nicolay copies of the Address are inside the Library of Congress. They are inside specially designed, temperature-controlled, sealed containers with argon gas. This is to protect the documents from oxidation.\nNicolay Copy.\nThe Nicolay Copy is often called the \"first draft\". This is because it is thought to be the earliest copy that exists. Scholars are not sure if the Nicolay Copy was actually the copy Lincoln read from at Gettysburg on November 19. In an 1894 article, Nicolay wrote that Lincoln had brought to Gettysburg the first part of the speech written in ink. Nicolay also said that Lincoln had written the second page in pencil on lined paper before November 19. Matching folds can still be seen on the two pages, suggesting it could be the copy that eyewitnesses say Lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony. But some of the words and expressions in the Nicolay Copy do not match modern transcriptions of Lincoln's speech. Because of this, some people believe that the text used at Gettysburg has been lost. The words \"under God\", for example, are missing in this copy from the phrase \"that this nation (under God) shall have a new birth of freedom...\" If the Nicolay draft was the copy Lincoln read from, either the modern transcriptions are not correct, or Lincoln spoke differently from his written text several times. John Nicolay kept this copy of the Gettysburg Address until he died in 1901. When he died, it was passed on to his friend John Hay. It is on permanent display as part of the American Treasures exhibition of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.\nHay Copy.\nIn 1906, it was first announced that the Hay Copy had been discovered. It had been found among the papers of John Hay when people were searching for the \"original manuscript\" of the Address. There are some important differences from the copy of the Address described by John Hay in his article. There are many important words taken out and added by Lincoln's own handwriting, which often changed the basic meaning of the sentence. In this copy, like in the Nicolay Copy, the words \"under God\" are not there.\nThis version has been described as \"the most inexplicable\" of the drafts. It is sometimes referred to as the \"second draft\". The \"Hay Copy\" was probably made on the morning of the delivery of the Address. It could also have been made shortly after Lincoln came back to Washington. The people who believe it was completed on the morning of his address note that it has some expressions that are not in the first draft but are in the reports of the address and in later copies by Lincoln. It is likely, they say, that Lincoln used this copy when he delivered the address. Lincoln later gave this copy to his other secretary, John Hay. Hay's descendants gave it and the Nicolay Copy to the Library of Congress in 1916.\nEverett Copy.\nThe Everett Copy is also known as the \"Everett-Keyes Copy\". It was sent by President Lincoln to Edward Everett in early 1864. Everett, who was collecting the speeches at the Gettysburg dedication into one book to sell for hurt soldiers at New York's Sanitary Commission Fair, had asked for it. The Illinois State Historical Library in Springfield, Illinois has it on display. It is in the Treasures Gallery of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.\nBancroft Copy.\nThe Bancroft Copy of the Gettysburg Address was written by President Lincoln in February 1864. The famous historian George Bancroft, the \"father of American History\", who wrote \"History of the United States\", had asked him to write it for him. Bancroft wanted to put this copy in \"Autograph Leaves of Our Country's Authors\" and sell it at a Soldiers' and Sailors' Sanitary Fair in Baltimore. But Lincoln wrote on both sides of the paper, so he could not use it for this purpose. Therefore, Bancroft was allowed to keep it. This copy was kept by the Bancroft family for many years. Then, it was sold to different dealers and bought by Nicholas and Marguerite Lilly Notes. They donated it to Cornell in 1949. It is now kept by the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A. Kroch Library at Cornell University. Among the five copies, it is the only one to be privately owned.\nBliss Copy.\nWhen Lincoln found that his fourth written copy could not be used, he wrote a fifth copy. The Bliss Copy was named for Colonel Alexander Bliss, Bancroft's stepson. It is not known if Lincoln made any more copies. Lincoln wrote this copy with much care. He gave it a title\u2014\"Address delivered at the dedication of the cemetery at Gettysburg\"\u2014and signed and dated this copy. In fact, it was the only copy of the Gettysburg Address he signed. Partly because of this, it has become the most well-known version of the Gettysburg Address. It is the source of most modern copies of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.\nToday, this copy hangs in the Lincoln Room of the White House. It is a present from Oscar B. Cintas, who used to be a Cuban Ambassador to the United States. Cintas liked to collect art and manuscripts. He had bought the Bliss Copy for $54,000 at a public auction in 1949. It \"set a new high record for the sale of a document at public auction\". The Castro government claimed Cintas' properties after it became powerful in 1959. But Cintas, who died in 1957, had willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, if it would be kept at the White House. It was moved there in 1959, and is still there today.\nOthers.\nAnother source of the Gettysburg Address is the copy from the Associated Press. It was copied from the notes taken by reporter Joseph L. Gilbert. It is different from the drafted words in a few ways.\nContemporary sources and reaction.\nEyewitnesses reports about Lincoln's performance are various. In 1931, 87-year-old Mrs. Sarah A. Cooke Myers suggested that there was a dignified silence after Lincoln finished his speech. She had been there when she was 19 years old. \"I was close to the President and heard all of the Address, but it seemed short. Then there was an impressive silence like our Menallen Friends Meeting. There was no applause when he stopped speaking\". Historian Shelby Foote said that the applause, which came after a long time, was \"barely polite\". But the governor of Pennsylvania, Curtin, said, \"He pronounced (said) that speech in a voice that all the multitude (people) heard. The crowd was hushed into silence because the President stood before was so Impressive! It was the common remark of everybody. Such a speech, as they said it was!\"\nThere is a story that Lincoln turned to his bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon and said that his speech \"won't scour (wouldn't be successful)\". Garry Wills argued that this story was not true. He said that Lamon was the only person who remembered this remark, and that it was not reliable. Garry Wills felt that Lincoln had done what he wanted to do at Gettysburg.\nThe following day, Everett wrote a letter to Lincoln. In the letter, he praised the President for his speech, saying, \"I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central (main) idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes\". Lincoln replied that he was glad the speech was not a \"total complete failure\".\nOther public reaction to the speech was different according to each party. The Democratic \"Chicago Times\" said, \"The cheek of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat and dishwatery utterances (remarks) of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the President of the United States\". However, the Republican \"New York Times\" praised the speech. The Springfield, MA. Republican newspaper printed the entire speech, calling it \"a perfect gem\" that was \"deep in feeling, compact (simple) in thought and expression, and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma\". The Republican said that Lincoln's short remarks would \"repay further study as the model speech\".\nAudio memories.\nWilliam R. Rathvon is the only known eyewitness of the Gettysburg Address to have left an audio recording of what he remembered. One year before he died in 1939, Rathvon's remarks were recorded on February 12, 1938. It included his reading the address itself. The title of the record was \"I Heard Lincoln That Day - William R. Rathvon, TR Productions\". The National Public Radio (NPR) discovered a copy during a \"Quest for Sound\" project in 1999. NPR allows people to hear the record around Lincoln's birthday.\nPhotographs.\nThe only known and confirmed photograph of Lincoln at Gettysburg was taken by David Bachrach. It was identified in the Mathew Brady collection of photographic plates in 1952. Lincoln's speech was short, but he and others sat for hours during the rest of the program. Because Everett's speech was very long, and because it took a long time for 19th century photographers to prepare for taking a picture, it is likely that photographers were not prepared for how short Lincoln's speech was. In 2006, John Richter identified two more photographs in the Library of Congress collection.\n\"Under God\".\nThe Nicolay and Hay copies do not have the words \"under God\", but they appear in the three later copies (Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss). So, some skeptics suggest that Lincoln did not say \"under God\" at Gettysburg. Yet at least three reporters telegraphed the words of the Gettysburg Address with the words \"under God\" included. Historian William E. Barton says:\nThe reporters who were there at that time included Joseph Gilbert, Charles Hale, John R. Young. There were also reporters from the \"Cincinnati Commercial\", \"New York Tribune\", and \"New York Times\". Charles Hale \"had notebook and pencil in hand, [and] took down the slow-spoken words of the President\". \"He took down what he declared was the exact language of Lincoln's associates confirmed his testimony, which was received, as it deserved to be at its face value\". Lincoln probably spoke differently from what he had prepared and added the expression when he was speaking.\nLegacy.\nThe Gettysburg Address's importance in the history of the United States can be seen by the long time it has been a part of American culture. Popular works often refer to the Gettysburg Address as if expecting that the audience will know Lincoln's words. Many years have passed after the Address was delivered, but it is still one of the most famous speeches in American history. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous speech of \"I Have a Dream\" spoke of the Gettysburg Address. In August 1963, King spoke of President Lincoln and his well-known words: \"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. came as a of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames \".\nThe Constitution of France spoke of France as a \"gouvernement du peuple, par le peuple et pour le peuple\" (\"government of the people, by the people, and for the people\"). This was a direct translation of Lincoln's words.\nThe address has become a part of American tradition. It is studied in schools and warmly praised by writers. The Gettysburg Address shows an important interpretation of the Declaration of Independence that is still remembered and used. It is widely accepted as one of the most important documents in U.S. history, together with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. To this day, it is one of the most famous, beloved, and most quoted of modern speeches."}

He was the most important French composer of his time. The way he wrote music, especially his harmonies, had a big influence on many 20th century composers. Most French composers at the time became famous by writing operas, but Faure only wrote one opera. His most important works are his French songs, chamber music and piano music. His \"Requiem\" (which includes a solo, \"Pie Jesu\", for a treble singer or soprano) is one of the most popular of all requiems and can be performed with quite a small orchestra and choir. Other very popular pieces are his \"Ber\u00e7euse\" from the \"Dolly Suite\" for piano duet, the \"Sicilienne\" from the music for \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", and the song \"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\" which is sometimes also played by a solo instrument, e.g. the cello.\nHis life.\nFaur\u00e9 came from the south of France. He was born into a large family and was sent to live with a foster-nurse for four years. When he was quite small he often played the harmonium at the small chapel attached to the school where his father was director. A blind lady heard him and told his father that he ought to send him to a good music school. His father did not want to at first, but when the boy was nine he was sent to study at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer in Paris. This was a school which trained young people to become church organists and choir directors. He spent eleven years there and had a good musical education. One of his teachers was the great composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns.\nAt first he held several jobs in churches, playing and accompanying the choirs. During the Franco-Prussian War Faure served in the army and did some teaching. When he returned to Paris in October of 1871 he got the job of choir accompanist at a big church in Paris called Saint-Sulpice. He often met up with Saint-Sa\u00ebns and his friends who included the composers Lalo, Duparc, d\u2019Indy and Chabrier. Several of these musicians, including Faur\u00e9 himself, formed a music society called Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique in 1871.\nIn 1874 Saint-Sa\u00ebns retired from the church called the Madeleine and Faur\u00e9 became choirmaster. In the same year he became engaged to Marianne Viardot, daughter of the singer Pauline, but then Marianne broke off the engagement. He travelled to Weimar to hear Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Faur\u00e9 liked Wagner\u2019s music but it did not influence him.\nIn 1883 Faur\u00e9 married Marie Fremiet. They had two sons. He had to spent a lot of time earning money by teaching to keep his family and so he did not have much time to compose except during the summer. His publishers did not pay him much money for his compositions.\nIn 1892 he became inspector of the music conservatories in the French provinces, which meant he no longer had to teach amateur students. In 1896 he finally became chief organist at the \u00c9glise de la Madeleine. He also became professor of composition at Paris Conservatoire. Here he taught several students who became important French composers, including Maurice Ravel, Nadia Boulanger and Charles Koechlin. In 1905 he became director of the conservatoire.\nAs he became older he became deaf. High and low pitches sounded muddled to him. He retired from the Conservatoire in 1920 at the age of 75. In that year he received the Grand Cross of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur. It was unusual for a musician to have such a high honour. His health became poor, partly because he smoked heavily. He died in Paris from pneumonia in 1924 and was given a state funeral.\nHis music.\nGabriel Faur\u00e9 is the greatest composer of French art song, or m\u00e9lodie. He learned a great deal at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer about how to write beautiful, flowing harmonies. He also studied the church modes. This can be heard in a lot of his music. He wrote several song cycles (groups of songs) including one called \"La Bonne Chanson\".\nFaur\u00e9's piano works are mostly short works such as barcarolles, nocturnes and impromptus. They are often full of arpeggiated figures with the melody going from one hand to the other. His chamber works include piano quartets and quintets, a string quartet, a piano trio, two sonatas for violin and piano and two for cello and piano. His \"\u00c9l\u00e9gie\" for cello and piano is especially well-known. He never showed a great deal of interest in writing for the orchestra. His orchestral works mostly consist of incidental music. His \"Requiem\" is popular both with amateur and professional choirs."}

In Tasmania he started farming on land the government gave him. He brought more land. During this time, he was involved in conflicts with the Tasmanian Aborigines.\nIn December 1825, or early 1826, Batman captured the notorious bushranger (a kind of robber), Matthew Brady.\nBatman asked to be given land in the Westernport area of Victoria, but the government rejected him. So, in 1835, as a leading member of the Port Phillip Association he sailed for the mainland of Australia in the schooner \"Rebecca\" and explored much of Port Phillip Bay. Batman made an agreement, now known as Batman's Treaty, with some local Aborigines to rent their land in return for things like knives and flour every year. Probably the Wurundjeri people did not understand the agreement. In any case, the Governor of New South Wales said the agreement was not legal the land was owned by the Government rather than the Aborigines.\nBatman became very unhealthy after 1835, and he separated from his wife, convict Elizabeth Callaghan. They had had seven daughters and a son. His son drowned in the Yarra River. In his last months the local Aborigines looked after him.\nBatman is remembered by some statues around Melbourne, and is buried in the Fawkner Cemetery, a cemetery named after his fellow colonist John Pascoe Fawkner. There is also a memorial in the Old Melbourne Cemetery.\nMelbourne was called Batmania for a very brief time, in 1835, after John Batman.\nHe was also one of the first Australians to take part in the Common wealth Games 1823.\nHis direct descendant is Australian sprinter Daniel Batman."}

It was in this year that two local men called Benjamin Satchwell and William Abbott discovered a spring in the village. The two men, and others from the town, began to use the water for treatment of illnesses, which was a common practice in those times. The town quickly developed into a spa town with many rich people visiting to 'take the waters'. Because of this the town grew quickly. The town soon became famous and a popular holiday resort. When spa water stopped being fashionable fewer people came on holiday to the town, but rich people still went to live there when they were old. In modern times Leamington does not treat many people with the water but it is still known as a pleasant place to live. It is also popular for shopping.\nThe town is built by a river called the River Leam which flows through the middle of the town from east to west. The town is now connected to another town called Warwick. Other nearby settlements include Kenilworth (about six miles away), Rugby (about sixteen miles away) and Coventry (about ten miles away).\nArchitecture.\nThe Parade and surrounding streets feature large Regency town houses typically with white fa\u00e7ades, sash windows and high ceilings.

Wordsworth was England's Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death in 1850. \nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nWordsworth was born as second of five children in the Lake District. After the death of his mother in 1778, his father sent him to \"Hawkshead\" Grammar School. In 1783 his father, a lawyer and a solicitor, died.\nAlthough many aspects of his boyhood were positive, he remembered times of loneliness and anxiety. It took him many years, and much writing, to recover from the death of his parents.\nWordsworth went to \"St John's College\", Cambridge in 1787. Three years later, in 1790, he visited Revolutionary France and supported the Republican movement, although the Reign of Terror later made him change his mind.(see Prelude book 10) The following year, he graduated from Cambridge.\nRelationship with Annette Vallon.\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth returned to France and took a walking tour of Europe that included the Alps and Italy. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who in 1792 gave birth to their child, Caroline. Because he was poor and there were tensions between Britain and France, he returned alone to England the next year. But he supported Annette Vallon and his daughter as best he could in later life. War between France and Britain prevented him from seeing Annette and Caroline again for several years. It is likely that Wordsworth would have been depressed during the 1790s.\nIn 1802 Wordsworth and his sister, Dorothy, visited Annette and Caroline in France.\nFirst publication and Lyrical Ballads.\nIn 1793 Wordsworth published the poetry collections \"An Evening Walk\" and \"Descriptive Sketches\". In 1795 he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. In 1797, Wordsworth and his sister, \"Dorothy\", moved to Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in \"Nether Stowey\". Together, Wordsworth and Coleridge produced \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The to \"Lyrical Ballads\" is considered a central work of Romantic literary theory. In it, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of poetry, one based on the \"real language of men\" and which avoids the poetic diction of much eighteenth-century poetry. Here, Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings from emotions recollected in tranquility.\"\nA fourth and final edition of \"Lyrical Ballads\" was published in 1805. He wrote a poem about daffodils and the Lake District.\nGermany and move to the Lake District.\nWordsworth, Dorothy, and Coleridge then traveled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. The main effect on Wordsworth was that he became homesick. But he began to work on the important autobiographical piece \"The Prelude\". He also wrote a number of famous poems, including \"the Lucy poems.\" He and his sister moved back to England, now to \"Dove Cottage\" in Grasmere in the Lake District, and this time with the poet Robert Southey nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey came to be known as the \"Lake Poets\". Through this period, many of his poems speak of death, endurance, separation, and grief.\nMarriage.\nIn 1802 he married a childhood friend, Mary Hutchinson. Dorothy continued to live with the couple. \nIn 1807, his \"Poems in Two Volumes\" were published, including \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\". \nTwo of his children, Thomas and Catherine, died in 1812. In 1813 his family, including Dorothy, moved to \"Rydal Mount, Ambleside\" , where he spent the rest of his life."}

Charles had spent the last 11 years ruling directly, without calling a Parliament even once. He did this because he had little use for elected representatives trying to decide policy. But now with the problems with the Scots, Charles needed money to pay for his war. To get more money for war meant he had to call a Parliament so they could vote on it.\nProblem.\nThe problem was that the members of Parliament were unhappy about the things he had done since 1629, when he was ruling without them. They wanted to talk about these things instead of giving the king his money. \u00a0John Pym, member for Tavistock, gave fiery speeches refusing to give money unless the abuses were talked about. Charles responded by closing the Parliament and sending them home again, and he tried to fight the Scots without the money. But when this did not work and as a result of his defeat had to agree to pay the Scots, he was forced to call Parliament again. This became known as the Long Parliament, and the Constitutional crisis that followed led to the bloody English Civil War."}

On this tablet were written down (according to Cicero) the name of the consuls and other magistrates, and then the important events of the year. \nIn Cicero's time these records were called \"Annales Maximi\". The practice of writing annals was carried on by several unofficial writers. Cicero speaks of Cato, Pictor and Piso. \nMedieval.\nIn the Middle Ages in the Western Church there were written tables to show that date of Easter for a certain number of years or even centuries. These \"Paschal tables\" were thin books in which each annual date was separated from the next by a more or less considerable blank space. In these spaces some monks wrote down the important events of the year. The writing of these Annals was begun at the end of the 7th century and among the Irish \u2013 see the Annals of the Four Masters, the Annals of Ulster, the Annals of Innisfallen and the Annales Cambriae or Annals of Wales, one of the earliest sources for King Arthur. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is also in annalistic, year-by-year form. \nIn the 9th century, during the \"Carolingian Renaissance\", these Annals became the usual form of contemporary history. There were the \"Annales Einhardi\", the \"Annales Laureshamenses\" (or \"of Lorsch\"), and the \"Annales S. Bertini\". They were written officially in order to preserve the memory of the more interesting acts of Charlemagne, his ancestors and his successors. At this stage, the Annals now began to lose their primitive character, and became more and more Chronicles. But the term was still used for many documents, such as the Annals of Waverley."}

Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1922 for, in short, discovering the quantization of atomic energy levels. He worked also in a project of physicists known as \"Manhattan Project\". He married Margrethe N\u00f8rlund in 1912. One of his sons was Aage Bohr, who was also an important physicist. Aage won in 1975 his own Nobel prize. Niels Bohr worked also with Albert Einstein. He is also considered one of the most important physicists of the 20th century. Niels Bohr is also known for winning an award of smelling elephants anus tubes. \nBiography.\nNiels Henrik David Bohr, or Niels Bohr was born in Copenhagen, Denmark,1885 as the son of Christian Bohr, who was also professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen. Bohr's mother was Ellen Adler Bohr and was Jewish with a rich family of bankers and politicians. Niels was also the brother of Harald Bohr. Bohr was a mathematician, a physicist, and funnily enough, was a football player of the national team. \nIn 1903 Bohr began studies of philosophy and mathematics at the Copenhagen University. \nIn 1905 the Royal Danish Academy of Science organized a competition. Niels Bohr participated with some experiments in surface tension. He used the laboratory of his father in the university, because he knew it since he was a boy. \nHis work won the prize. For this reason, he decided to stop the studies of philosophy and mathematics and changed to physics. \nHe received his doctorate in 1911. \nBohr did experiments in the Trinity College in Cambridge under the direction of J.J. Thomson. After it, he went to the University of Manchester under the direction of Ernest Rutherford. On the basis of the theories of Rutherford, he published his theory of electrons. He introduces the theory of electrons traveling in orbits around the nucleus of the atom in 1913 and the chemical properties of the orbit.\nHe introduced the idea that an electron can drop from a higher energy orbit to a lower one. Then it can emit a photon of discrete energy. This is the basis of quantum theory. \nNiels Bohr and his wife Margrethe N\u00f8rlund Bohr had four sons. Their oldest died in a tragic boating accident and another died from childhood meningitis. The others went on to lead successful lives, including Aage Bohr, who became a very successful physicist and, like his father, won a Nobel Prize in physics, in 1975."}

There are special words for a Requiem Mass. They are in Latin. The best-known part of the Requiem Mass starts with the words \u201cRequiem aeternam dona eis, Domine\u201d (\u201cGive them eternal rest, O Lord\u201d). This is why it is called a \u201cRequiem\u201d.\nMany composers throughout the centuries have composed music to these words. The word \u201cRequiem\u201d can mean a piece of music which sets the words of the Requiem Mass.\nCelebration of the Eucharist to pray for people who have died goes back at least as far as the 2nd century.\nIn the Middle Ages the words of the Requiem Mass were sung to Gregorian chant.\nIn the Renaissance church music was generally polyphonic. This sort of music, which has several voices weaving in and out of one another, is the kind of music used at the time for requiems. The composer Johannes Ockeghem is an example of a composer who wrote such music.\nPolyphonic settings of the Requiem Mass continued during the Baroque period (17th and early 18th centuries), even although other musical forms (e.g. opera) had developed a much more modern style.\nThe most famous Requiem from the 18th century is the one by Mozart. Many musicians think it was one of the greatest pieces of music ever written. It was left unfinished when Mozart died.\nIn the 19th century many composers wrote Requiems. Most of these were written for performance at concerts, not for church services, but they still used the Latin words of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass.\nLuigi Cherubini wrote a Requiem in C minor for the annual remembering of the execution of Louis XVI. He wrote another Requiem in D minor, which he wrote for himself. It was performed at his own funeral.\nGiuseppe Verdi wrote a very exciting \"Messa da Requiem\" (1874) which sounds very operatic. Verdi rearranged some of the text (words) of the traditional Requiem Mass.\nBruckner, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k all wrote requiems.\nBrahms wrote a work which he called \"Ein Deutsches Requiem\" (\"A German Requiem\"). It is unusual because, instead of setting the traditional Latin words, he took some words from the German translation of the Bible.\nIn 1888 Gabriel Faur\u00e9 wrote a Requiem which uses an orchestra without violins except for a solo violin in the movement called \u201cSanctus\u201d. In 1900 he made some changes and added an important baritone solo.\nIn the 20th century many composers continued to write Requiems. The most famous one is Britten\u2019s \"War Requiem\" (1961). The message of this work is that war is cruel and pointless. Britten uses the Latin words of the Requiem Mass, but also some English poems by Wilfred Owen who was killed in the First World War. The baritone and tenor soloists who sing these English words represent the German and the English soldiers. The work was written for Coventry Cathedral which had been rebuilt after the old cathedral had been totally destroyed in World War II.\nDifferent parts of a Requiem.\nOlder Requiems.\nFor example, Mozart's Requiem follows this. In his requiem, the Lux aeterna (written by someone else) is the same as the Introitus, with different words.\nSome musical examples:\nNewer Requiems.\nThis sequence was fixed by the Council of Trent in the 16th century. It was slightly modified in the Second Vatican Council."}

He was born in Segesv\u00e1r, Transylvania, - then under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary - in 1431. He was the Prince of Wallachia and ruled there three times, in 1448, 1456\u20131462 and 1476.\nIn the English-speaking world, Vlad is best known for the legends of his cruelty. These legends gave Bram Stoker the idea for his main character in the popular \"Dracula\" novel.\nHistorical background.\nWallachia was placed between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. The Turks were fighting against the Kingdom of Hungary and this made Wallachia a battle ground between Turks and Hungarians. The rulers of Wallachia were chosen by the Romanian aristocrats, called boyars. The ruler was often from a noble house, sometimes an illegitimate prince born outside of marriage. The country rulers were struggling with each other, and this was resulting in instability, family disputes and murders.\nBiography.\nFamily background.\nVlad the Impaler was born in 1431. His father was Vlad II Dracul. His mother is unknown. Vlad II was married to princess Cneajna of Moldavia. He had several mistresses. Vlad III was raised by Cneajna with the help of her household. He had two brothers, Mircea born c. 1430 and Radu born 1435. He also had a half-brother, Vlad the Monk born around 1425-1430.\nVlad II went to the court of Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund of Luxemburg as a young man. Sigismund was supporting Vlad II for the throne of Wallachia, and made Vlad II knight 1431 of the Order of the Dragon (\"Societas Draconis\" in Latin).\nThe oldest brother, probably named Mircea, was sent by Vlad II to fight the war against the Turks in 1444. This war called the Battle of Varna was lost. Mircea and his father died in 1447.\nVlad's half-brother. Vlad the Monk was waiting in Transylvania for a chance to rule Wallachia. Vlad the Monk was a monk until he became prince of Wallachia in 1482.\nRadu, known as Radu III the Fair or Radu the Handsome, the youngest brother, was also Vlad\u2019s most important rival as he continuously tried to replace Vlad on the throne.\nMarriage.\nFrom his first marriage, Vlad the Impaler (or Vlad III) had a son, later prince of Wallachia, as Mihnea the Evil. His first wife, whose name we do not know, died during the war 1462. Vlad III the Impaler was fighting against the Turks. The legend says that the Turkish army surrounded Vlad's castle, the Poienari Castle, led by his brother Radu the Handsome. Vlad's wife threw herself off the tower into the Arge\u015f River below the castle. According to legend she remarked that she \"would rather have her body be eaten by the fish of the Arge\u015f than be captured by the Turks.\" \nVlad had another two sons with his second wife Ilona Szil\u00e1gyi a fraternal cousin of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. Some historians strongly believe they may have also had a daughter named Maria Zaleska (Princess Zaleska).\nEarly years.\nVlad was very likely born in the city of Sighi\u015foara in Transylvania, then a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, during the winter of 1431. Sighi\u015foara was a military fortress at that time. He was born as the second son to his father Vlad Dracul. He had an older brother, Mircea, and a younger brother, Radu the Handsome. Although his native country was Wallachia, the family lived in exile in Transylvania because his father had been chased away by pro-Ottoman boyars.\nA hostage of the Ottoman Empire.\nVlad's father was pressured by the (Turkish) Ottoman sultan. He gave a promise to be the vassal of the Sultan and gave up his two younger sons as hostages so that he would keep his promise.\nVlad suffered much at the hands of the Ottomans, and was locked up in an underground prison; however, his younger brother, Radu, caught the eye of the sultan's son. Radu was released and converted to Islam, and he was allowed into the Ottoman royal court.\nThese years had a great influence on Vlad. They shaped Vlad's character. He was often whipped and beaten by the Turks for being stubborn and rude. He developed a well-known hatred for Radu and for Mehmed, who would later become the sultan.\nShort reign and exile.\nVlad's father and Vlad's older brother, Mircea, were dead at this point. The Turks invaded Wallachia and the Sultan put Vlad III on the throne as his puppet ruler. His rule at this time was short; Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and chased him away the same year. Vlad fled to Moldavia and was put under the protection of his uncle, Bogdan II.\nWar.\nBogdan was assassinated. Vlad took a chance and fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad's knowledge of the Ottoman Empire, Hunyadi pardoned him and took him in as an adviser. Later, Hunyadi made him the Kingdom of Hungary's candidate for the throne of Wallachia.\nIn 1456, Hungary invaded Serbia to chase away the Turks, and at the same time Vlad III invaded Wallachia. Both invasions were successful. Hunyadi suddenly died of the plague. Vlad became prince of Wallachia.\nMain reign (1456\u201362).\nVlad was spending most of his time at the court of the city of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte. He made laws, met foreign ambassadors, judged in trials. He reinforced some castles and probably enjoyed hunting with his friends. \nThe constant state of war since the death of his grandfather, Mircea the Elder, in 1418, led to increased crime levels and less agricultural production. Trade had almost disappeared in Wallachia.\nVlad tried to solve these problems with severe methods. He needed an economically stable country.\nVlad wanted to eliminate all threats to his power, mainly the rival nobility groups, such as the boyars. This was done mainly by killing them and reducing the their economic role. The Wallachian nobility had connections with the Saxon merchants. The Saxons lived in the free towns of Transylvania, making trade flourish. Vlad cut their towns trade privileges with Wallachia, and started war against them.\nVlad gave key positions in the Prince\u2019s Council to people of lower rank who were loyal to him. Vlad preferred to knight men from the free peasants. \nVlad III was always on guard against the D\u0103ne\u015fti clan. Some of his attacks into Transylvania may have been efforts to kill or capture D\u0103ne\u015fti princes. Several members of the D\u0103ne\u015fti clan died at Vlad's hands. Rumors say that thousands of citizens of the free towns that sheltered his rivals were impaled by Vlad. One captured D\u0103ne\u015fti prince was forced to read his own funeral speech while he kneeled at an open grave before his execution.\nPersonal crusade.\nThere was a war between the Ottoman Empire and the Hungarian Kingdom. Following family traditions, Vlad decided to side with the Hungarians. To the end of the 1450s there was once again talk about a war against the Turks, in which the king of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus would play the main role. Knowing this, Vlad stopped paying money to the Ottomans in 1459, and at around 1460, he made a new alliance with Corvinus. The Turks did not like this and tried to remove him from power but they failed. In the winter of 1461 Vlad attacked and devastated the area between Serbia and the Black Sea, leaving over 20,000 people dead.\nIn response to this, the Sultan Mehmed II headed towards Wallachia with an army of 60,000 men in the spring of 1462. With his army of 20,000-30,000 men Vlad was not able to stop the Turks from entering Wallachia. The Turks occupied the capital T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte (June 4, 1462) and chased Vlad away. Vlad was hiding and made small attacks on the Turks. On the night of June 16 Vlad and some of his men entered the main Turkish camp, wearing Turkish clothing, and attempted to kill Mehmed. Later the Turkish army retired and left Vlad\u2019s brother, Radu the Handsome, as the new ruler prince.\nRadu the Handsome gathered support from the nobility and Vlad fled to Hungary.\nIn August 1462 Radu made a deal with the Hungarian Crown.\nIn captivity.\nVlad was living in exile because he was afraid of the boyars of Wallachia. Vlad escaped to Hungary but he was put in prison there. The exact time of Vlad's captivity is not known for sure. Apparently his imprisonment was not too dangerous. He was able to gradually win his way back into the favor of King Matthias. He was able to meet and marry a member of the royal family (the cousin of King Matthias). However, some do not believe that it was likely to happen that a prisoner was permitted to marry into the royal family.\nHe had two sons with his new wife. Vlad also became a member of the Roman Catholic Church. Diplomatic letters and writings from Buda during this time show that Vlad's actual period of imprisonment was short.\nThe openly pro-Turkish policy of Vlad's brother, Radu was probably a cause in Vlad's good treatment while in prison. It is interesting to note that the Russian texts, normally very favorable to Vlad \u0162epe\u015f, tells that even in captivity he could not give up his favorite games; he often captured birds and mice which he tortured and mutilated, and some were impaled on tiny spears.\nThe years before his final release in 1474 (when he began making plans for the reconquest of Wallachia), Vlad lived with his new wife in a house in the Hungarian capital. His sons were about ten years old when he reconquered Wallachia in 1476.\nReturn to Wallachia and death.\nAround 1475 Vlad and Stefan B\u00e1thory of Transylvania invaded Wallachia with a mixed force of Transylvanians, some dissatisfied Wallachian boyars, and Moldavians sent by Prince Stephen III of Moldavia, Vlad's cousin. Vlad's brother, Radu the Handsome, died a couple of years earlier and had been replaced on the Wallachian throne by another Turkish candidate, Prince Basarab the Elder, a member of the D\u0103ne\u015fti clan. When Vlad's army arrived, Prince Basarabs army fled, some to the Turks, others in the mountains. After placing Vlad \u0162epe\u015f on the throne, Stephen B\u00e1thory and his forces returned to Transylvania, leaving Vlad in a very weak position. Vlad had little time to get support before a large Turkish army entered Wallachia to put back Prince Basarab on the throne. Vlad's cruelties over the years made the boyars to believe that they had a better chance to survive under Prince Basarab. Even the peasants, tired of the cruelty of Vlad, abandoned him. Vlad had to meet the Turks with the small forces at his disposal, which were made up of less than four thousand men.\nThere are several variants of Vlad III the Impaler's death. Some sources say he was killed in battle against the Turks near Bucharest in December of 1476. Others say he was killed by disloyal Wallachian boyars in the war against the Turks, or during a hunt. Others believe Vlad was killed in the war, surrounded by the bodies of his loyal Moldavian bodyguards. Still other reports claim that Vlad was accidentally killed by one of his own men. Vlad's body was decapitated by the Turks and his head was sent to Istanbul preserved in honey. The sultan had it displayed on a stake as proof that \"Kaz\u0131kl\u0131 Bey\" was dead. The exact place of his grave is unknown.\nLegacy.\nTales and legends about Vlad stayed a part of folklore among the Romanian peasants. By constant retelling they have become confused and created an ideal picture of a big national hero. Among the Romanian peasants, Vlad \u0162epe\u015f was sometimes remembered as a prince who defended his country.\nBut sometimes he is remembered as a very cruel and often capricious ruler. There are several events that are common to all tales.\nOne tale is about foreign ambassadors whom Vlad \u0162epe\u015f was meeting at T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte. All versions agree that Vlad, in response to some real or imagined insult, (perhaps because they refused to remove the hats in Vlad's presence), had their hats nailed to their heads.\nA good description of Vlad Dracula survives, courtesy of Nicholas of Modrussa, who wrote: \n\"He was not very tall, but very stocky and strong, with a cruel and terrible appearance, a long straight nose, distended nostrils, a thin and reddish face in which the large wide-open green eyes were enframed by bushy black eyebrows, which made them appear threatening. His face and chin were shaven but for a moustache. The swollen temples increased the bulk of his head. A bull's neck supported the head, from which black curly locks were falling to his wide-shouldered person.\"\nHis famous portrait was rediscovered in the late 1800s, in the gallery of horrors at Innsbruck's Ambras Castle.\nCruelty.\nVlad III \u0162epe\u015f has been described as very cruel. The old Romanian word for dragon is Dracul, which in modern Romanian means \"devil\". In Old Romanian, it means \"dragon\". Dracul was the name given to his father, Vlad II, by other members of the Order of the Dragon. Impalement was \u0162epe\u015f's preferred method of torture and execution. His method of torture was a horse attached to each of the victim's legs while sharpened stake was forced into the body. Vlad often had the stakes arranged in patterns. The most common pattern was a ring outside of a city that was his target. The height of the spear indicated the rank of the victim. The corpses were often left there for months.\nOne tale says 10,000 were impaled in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu (where Vlad the Impaler had once lived) in 1460. Another tale says that on Saint Bartholomew's Day (in August), Vlad the Impaler had 30,000 people of the free Transylvanian city of Bra\u015fov impaled. One of the most famous woodcuts of the period shows Vlad the Impaler feasting amongst a forest of stakes outside Bra\u015fov, while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims. Impalement was not his only method of torture. Other methods include nails in heads, cutting off limbs, strangulation, burning, cutting off noses and ears, mutilation of sexual organs (especially in the case of women), scalping, skinning, exposure to the elements or to animals, and boiling alive.\nHis victims included women, children, peasants, great lords, ambassadors from foreign powers and merchants. However, the vast majority of his European victims came from the merchants and boyars of Transylvania and Wallachia. Most of the merchants there were German-speaking Saxons who were seen as bad people because they were not Romanian. He saw the boyars as people who were not loyal (Vlad's own father and older brother were murdered by boyars).\nAlmost as soon as he came to power, he gave a party for his boyars and their families to celebrate Easter. These nobles were part of the conspiracy around his father's death. Vlad, to avenge his father's death, had all the assembled nobles arrested. The older boyars were impaled on the spot. The younger nobles and their families were marched north from T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte to the ruins of the Poienari Castle in the mountains above the Arge\u015f River. The boyars and their families were forced to work for months rebuilding the old castle. According to the reports, they worked until the clothes fell off their bodies, and then were forced to continue working naked. Very few survived the building of Vlad's castle.\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f is also believed to have tortured and impaled some of the Turkish forces. It was reported that an invading Ottoman army turned back when they saw thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the river Danube. In 1462, Mehmed II returned to Constantinople after being sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses outside of Vlad's capital of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte. Many of the victims were Turkish prisoners of war.\nAnecdotal evidence.\nMuch of the information we have about Vlad III \u0162epe\u015f comes from texts published in the Holy Roman Empire in German texts from 1488 and books written in Russian. These were entertainment in a society where the printing press was new. The texts were reprinted over the thirty years following Vlad's death. The German texts said Vlad \u0162epe\u015f was a person who terrorized the land and killed innocents. The Russian texts said his actions were justified, because Vlad helped them. The texts agree on some details.\nAccording to the texts, he was particularly cruel against women and wanted his people to work hard. Merchants who cheated their customers were likely to be killed because of that.\nThe vampire legend.\nThe fictional vampire in the novel \"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker was inspired by the legends of this Wallachian prince. The cruel person of the Impaler was a suitable character for Stoker's purposes possibly combined with Oscar Wilde, a poet whom dated Stoker's wife and was outed as homosexual near the making of Stoker's famous novel. The events of Vlad's life happened in a region of the world that was still medieval in Stoker's time.\nAlthough there were vampire tales originating elsewhere, the vampire, as he became known in Europe, largely originated in Southern Slavic and Greek folklore. The vampire tale is virtually absent in Romanian culture. Vampirism became part of the popular culture in Europe beginning in the late 17th century. Philosophers in the West began to study the phenomenon. It was during this period that Dom Augustine Calmet wrote a famous text on vampirism in Hungary. It was also during this period that authors and playwrights first began to explore the vampire legend. Stoker's novel was a work in a long series of works that were inspired by the reports coming from the Balkans."}

Many people think it is one of the world's most sacred rivers.\nIt is long. Its tributaries are:\nThe four rivers join to form the Jordan in northern Israel, near kibbutz Sede Nehemya. The Jordan drops quickly in a 75 kilometer run to Lake Hula, which is a little below sea level in the Galilee sea. Then it drops much more in about 25 kilometers to the Sea of Galilee. The last section has less gradient, and the river begins to twist before it enters the Dead Sea, which is about 400 meters below sea level and has no outlet. Two major tributaries enter this last section from the east: the Yarmouk River and Jabbok River.\nIn 1964, Israel began operating a dam that takes water from the Sea of Galilee, a major Jordan River water provider, to the national water carrier. Also in 1964 Jordan built a channel that takes water from the Yarmouk River, a main tributary of the Jordan River. This caused great damage to the ecosystem. Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk's waters.\nIn modern times, 70% to 90% of the waters is used for human purposes and the flow is much smaller. Because of this, and the high evaporation rate of the Dead Sea, the sea is shrinking. All the shallow waters of the southern end of the sea have been drained in modern times, and are now salt flats.\nThe water from the Jordan is a very important resource to the dry lands of the area. It is a source of conflict between Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Palestine.\nIn the Bible.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the Jordan is referred to as the source of fertility to a large plain (\"Kikkar ha-Yarden\"), called \"the garden of God\" (Genesis 13:10). There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible.\nThe New Testament states that John the Baptist baptized Jesus in the Jordan (Matt. 3:13).\nSymbolic importance.\nThe Jordan is a frequent symbol in folk, gospel, and spiritual music, or in poetic or literary works.\nBecause the Israelites made a difficult journey from slavery in Egypt to freedom in \"The Promised Land\", the Jordan can be a symbol of freedom. The actual crossing is the final step of the journey, which is then complete. Also, the Jordan can mean death itself, with the crossing from life into Paradise or Heaven."}

The historical development of Islam has affected political, economic, and military trends both inside and outside the Islamic world.\nAs with Christianity, the concept of an \"Islamic world\" is useful when one looks at different periods of human history.\nEarly Muslim history.\nAfter Muhammad passed away, the Muslim leadership was assumed by Abu Bakr. He was followed by Umar, Uthman ibn Affan and then Ali. These four are called the \"Rashidun caliphs\" which means The Righteous Caliphs. The word caliph means religious and spiritual leader. Under these caliphs Islam became one of the most important religions of the middle East. Administrative offices of the Muslim nation were established. Under Umar more than two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire was conquered by the Muslims. Umar also started the Muslim calendar.\nIslamic civil wars.\nThe First \"Fitna\".\nThe first civil war in Islam, also known as the \"First Fitna\" broke out in Islam during the rule of the fourth caliph Ali and lasted throughout his caliphate. The third caliph Uthman ibn Affan had been murdered by rebel Muslim groups who had political motives. After Ali took over, the most important problem he faced was that of punishing those responsible for murder. However many people felt that before accepting the position of the caliph, Ali should have focused his attention on finding and punishing the murderers. A group of people led by Muhammad's wife Aisha, her brothers in law Talhah and Zubair ibn al-Awam refused to recognize Ali's caliphate. They instead raised an army which met Ali's army at Basra in Iraq, originally for the purposes of negotiations. In the night, some fighting broke out, probably out of confusion or due to rebel groups who were involved in the infamous murder. This led to the \"Battle of Bassorah\" (also known as \"Battle of the Camel\") in which Ali's party emerged victorious. Aisha was escorted back to Medina honorably after the battle by Ali.\nThis battle however did not entirely finish the tension in the Muslim empire. Ali was soon challenged by Muawiyah, the governor of the Muslim provinces of Syria. He too raised the issue of punishing Uthman's murderers and refused to acknowledge Ali as caliph until the issue had been solved. Muawiyah was a kinsman of Uthman and his army pledged to bring to justice the murderers and those who sheltered them. This reference to people who are sheltering the murderers was towards Ali and his followers. Accordingly, the two groups met and fought a battle, called the \"Battle of Siffin\". This battle ended in a draw and so both groups decided on arbitration which also did not lead to any concrete decision. Another group of Muslims, \"The Kharijites\" who had previously been with Ali, meanwhile rejected him because they felt that he was not following true Islam and conducting business over the caliphate as if it were his own property.\nIn the following years Ali's governors could not prevent his losing provinces to Muawiyah who increased his strength by further expanding his army. Ali had shifted the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in 656. He was killed by a Kharijite assassin in Kufa in 661."}
{"id": "54463", "revid": "7893718", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54463", "title": "History of Christianity", "text": "The history of the Christian religion and the Christian church began with Jesus and his apostles. Christianity is the religion that is based on the birth, life, death, resurrection and teaching of Jesus Christ.\nChristianity began in the 1st century CE after Jesus died and was resurrected. Starting as a small group of Jewish people in Judea, it spread quickly throughout the Roman Empire. Despite early persecution of Christians, it later became the state religion. In the Middle Ages it spread into Northern Europe and Russia. During the Age of Exploration, Christianity expanded throughout the world; it is currently the largest religion of the world. \nThe religion had schisms and theological disputes that had as result four main branches: the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox churches, Oriental Orthodoxy and Protestant churches.\nMost of the first Christians were ethnically Jewish or Jewish proselytes. An early difficulty came from non-Jewish converts. There was the question if they had to \"become Jewish\" before becoming Christian. The decision of St. Peter, was that they did not, and the matter was further addressed with the Council of Jerusalem.\nThe doctrines of the apostles brought the Early Church into conflict with some Jewish religious authorities, and this eventually led to the martyrdom of SS. Stephen and James the Great and expulsion from the synagogues. Thus, Christianity got an identity distinct from Judaism. The name \"Christian\" (Greek ) was first used for the disciples in Antioch, as recorded in (Acts 11:26).\nWorship of Jesus Christ.\nSources for the beliefs of the apostolic community include the Gospels and New Testament Epistles. The very earliest reports are in these texts: early Christian creeds and hymns and reports about the Passion, the empty tomb, and appearances of Jesus after his Resurrection. There are reasons to suppose that they were written within a few years of the crucifixion of Jesus and came from the Jerusalem Church.\nJewish continuity.\nChristianity kept many practices from Jewish tradition. Christianity thought the Jewish scriptures to be sacred and used mostly the Septuagint translation of the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament), the Hebrew Prophets and Writings (the rest of the Old Testament books), and added other texts as the New Testament. Christians professed Jesus to be the God of Israel, having taken human form, and considered Jesus to be the Messiah (Christ) who had been prophesied about in the Old Testament and so was expected by the people of Israel. \nChristianity continued many Judaic practices: liturgical worship, including the use of incense, an altar, a set of scriptural readings adapted from synagogue practice, use of sacred music in hymns and prayer, and a religious calendar, as well as other typical features: an exclusively male priesthood, and ascetic practices (fasting etc.).\nPost-Apostolic Church.\nThe time when most of the apostles had died and their jobs as leaders of the Christian communities in the cities had been taken over by bishops, is called post-apostolic period. It includes the time of persecutions until Christian worship was legalized under Constantine the Great. The earliest recorded use of the term \"Christianity\" (Greek ) is from this period. The term was used by Ignatius of Antioch \"c.\" 107.\nPersecutions.\nEarly Christians were subject to various persecutions. This meant even death. Early martyrs included Stephen () and James, son of Zebedee (). Persecutions in larger scale by the authorities of the Roman Empire began with the year 64, when the Emperor Nero blamed them for the great Fire of Rome as the Roman historian Tacitus reported.\nAccording to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that the saints Peter and Paul became martyrs in Rome. Several of the New Testament writings mention persecutions and very difficult times. For 250 years there were times when Christians suffered from persecutions, because they refused to worship the Roman emperor. That was seen as treason and punished by execution. But the Christian religion continued to spread throughout the Mediterranean region. In the late fourth century they became the dominant religious force of the Roman Empire.\nChristianity legalized.\nThe first to legalize Christianity was the Armenian king Trdat the Third, who announced it the official religion in Armenia in the year 301. Galerius issued an edict permitting the practice of the Christian religion in April of 311. In 313 Constantine I and Licinius announced toleration of Christianity in the Edict of Milan. Constantine became the first Christian emperor; he had learnt about Christianity from his mother, Helena. \nBy 391, under the reign of Theodosius I, Christianity had become the state religion of Rome. \nWhen Christianity was legalized the Church used the same provinces for administration as the imperial government and called them dioceses. The Bishop of Rome claimed to be the highest amongst all others and chose the title pope.\nDuring this era, there were several Ecumenical Councils. These were mostly concerned with Christological disputes. The First Council of Nicaea condemned Arianism and produced the Nicene Creed to define the faith. The Council of Ephesus condemned Nestorianism and affirmed the Blessed Virgin Mary to be Theotokos (\"God-bearer\" or \"Mother of God\"). Perhaps the most important was the Council of Chalcedon that affirmed that Christ had two natures, fully God and fully man, at the same time. That meant that Monophysitism was condemned.\nChurch of the Early Middle Ages (476 \u2013 800).\nThe Church in the Early Middle Ages saw a \"transformation of the Roman world\" rather than a \"fall of the Roman Empire\". With the Muslim invasions of the seventh century, the Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) areas of Christianity began to take on distinctive shapes, and the Bishops of Rome were more interested in barbarian kings than in the Byzantine Emperors. This led to the coronation of Charlemagne as \"Emperor of the Romans\" by Pope Leo III in Rome on Christmas Day, 800.\nEarly Medieval Papacy.\nThe city of Rome was affected very much by warfare in Italy during the Early Middle Ages. Emperor Justinian I conquered the Italian kingdom of the Ostrogoths. He made Ravenna, Italy a territory with its own governor, but imperial influence was often limited. After the invasion of the Lombards, Rome had to take care of itself. Thus the popes, out of necessity, found themselves feeding the city with grain from papal estates, negotiating treaties, paying protection money to Lombard warlords, and, failing that, hiring soldiers to defend the city. Eventually, the failure of the Empire to send aid resulted in the popes turning for support from other sources, most especially the Franks.\nChurch of the High Middle Ages (800 \u2013 1499).\nThe High Middle Ages is the period from the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 to the close of the fifteenth century, which saw the fall of Constantinople (1453), the end of the Hundred Years' War (1453), the discovery of the New World (1492), and thereafter the Protestant Reformation (1515).\nInvestiture Controversy.\nThe \"Investiture Controversy\", also known as the \"lay investiture controversy\", was the most important conflict between secular and religious powers in medieval Europe. It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. The question was who would control appointments of bishops (investiture). The end of lay investiture meant an important loss of royal power, and a loss for ambitious noblemen, for the benefit of Church reform as the pope intended.\nBishops collected revenues from estates attached to their bishopric. Noblemen who held lands (fiefdoms) hereditarily passed those lands on within their family. However, a king had more control of lands under the domain of his bishops. Kings would give bishoprics to powerful friends. If a king left a bishopric vacant, he got the money until a bishop was appointed, when he was supposed to repay the earnings. This seldom happened. The Church wanted to end this lay investiture because of the vacant sees simony and other problems. Thus, the Investiture Contest was part of the Church's attempt to reform the episcopate and get better bishops. \nPope Gregory VII issued the \"Dictatus Papae\", which said only the pope may make, break, or move bishops to other sees. The Emperor rejected this. With excommunication and a revolt by his dukes, Henry apologized and was forgiven, though the conflict continued. A similar controversy happened in England between King Henry I and St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury. The English dispute was resolved by a deal in 1107, where the king gave up making bishops but did require an oath of fealty. The later Concordat of Worms (\"Pactum Calixtinum\") resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a similar compromise.\nCrusades.\nThe Crusades were a military conflicts conducted by Christian knights for the defense of Christians and for the expansion of Christian domains. Generally, the crusades refer to the campaigns in the Holy Land against Muslim forces sponsored by the Papacy. There were other crusades against Islamic forces in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily, as well as the campaigns of Teutonic knights against pagan strongholds in Eastern Europe, and (to a much lesser extent) crusades against Catharism or other Christian heresies.\nThe Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire, and thus Byzantine Empire, until the Islamic conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries. Thereafter, Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071, when the Seljuk Turks closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines, defeating them at the Battle of Manzikert. Emperor Alexius I asked for aid from Pope Urban II (1088-1099) for help against Islamic aggression. Instead of sending money, Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the Council of Clermont on 27 November 1095, combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against infidels.\nEast-West Schism.\nThe East-West Schism, or Great Schism, separated the Church into Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) branches, i.e. Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. It was the first major division since certain groups in the East rejected the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon (see Oriental Orthodoxy), and was far more significant. Though normally dated to 1054, the East-West Schism was the result of an long time of disagreement between Latin and Greek Christendom over papal primacy and certain doctrinal matters like the \"filioque\". Bad feelings were intensified by cultural and linguistic differences.\nThe schism became \"official\" in 1054 when the Pope's legates notified Patriarch Michael Cerularius of Constantinople that he had been excommunicated. A few days later, he excommunicated the legates. Attempts at reconciliation were made in 1274 in Lyon and in 1439 in Basel, but in each case the eastern hierarchs who agreed to the unions were repudiated by the Orthodox as a whole. However, reconciliation was achieved between the West and what are now called the \"Eastern Rite Catholic Churches\". More recently, in 1965 the mutual excommunications were rescinded by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople, though schism remains.\nBoth groups are descended from the Early Church, both acknowledge the apostolic succession of each other's bishops, and the validity of each other's sacraments. Though both acknowledge the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, Eastern Orthodoxy understands this as a primacy of honor with limited or no ecclesiastical authority in other dioceses.\nWestern Schism.\nThe Western Schism, or Papal Schism, was a prolonged period of crisis in Latin Christendom from 1378 to 1416, when there were two or more claimants to the See of Rome and thus it was difficult to discern who the true Pope was. The conflict was political, rather than doctrinal, in nature.\nChurch and the Italian Renaissance (1399 \u2013 1599).\nThe Renaissance was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The City of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church patroned such artists as Michelangelo, Brunelleschi, Bramante, Raphael, Fra Angelico, Donatello, and da Vinci. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as Alexander VI and Sixtus IV.\nProtestant Reformation (1521 \u2013 1579).\nIn the early 16th century, movements were begun by two theologians, Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli, that aimed to reform the Church. Unlike earlier reformers they considered the root of corruptions to be doctrinal (rather than simply a matter of moral weakness or lack of ecclesiastical discipline) and thus they aimed to change contemporary doctrines to fit their idea of the \"true gospel\". The Protestant Reformation is so called because the movement's leaders \"protested\" against the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the pope, essentially electing to institute their reforms separately from it. The term \"Protestant\", however, was not originally used by these leaders; instead, they called themselves \"evangelical\", emphasizing the \"return to the true gospel (Greek: \"euangelion\")\".\nThe beginning of the Protestant Reformation is generally identified with Martin Luther and the posting of the 95 Theses in 1517 in Wittenburg, Germany. Early protest was against corruptions such as simony, episcopal vacancies, and the sale of indulgences. The Protestant position, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as sola scriptura and sola fide. The three most important traditions to emerge directly from the Protestant Reformation were the Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist, Presbyterian, etc.), and Anglican traditions, though the latter group identifies as both \"Reformed\" and \"Catholic\", and some subgroups reject the classification as \"Protestant\".\nThe Protestant Reformation may be divided into two distinct but basically simultaneous movements, the Magisterial Reformation and the Radical Reformation. The Magisterial Reformation involved the alliance of certain theological teachers (Latin: \"magistri\") such as Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, Cranmer, etc. with secular magistrates who cooperated in the reformation of Christendom. Radical Reformers, besides forming communities outside state sanction, often employed more extreme doctrinal change, such as the rejection of tenants of the Councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon. Often the division between magisterial and radical reformers was as or more violent than the general Catholic and Protestant hostilities.\nThe Protestant Reformation spread almost entirely within the confines of Northern Europe, but did not take hold in certain northern areas such as Ireland and parts of Germany. By far the magisterial reformers were more successful and their changes more widespread than the radical reformers. The Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation is known as the Counter Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, which resulted in a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity. The Counter Reformation reconverted approximately 33% of Northern Europe to Catholicism and initiated missions in South and Central America, Africa, Asia, and even China and Japan. Protestant expansion outside of Europe occurred on a smaller scale through colonization of North America and areas of Africa.\nMartin Luther.\nMartin Luther was an Augustinian friar and professor at the University of Wittenberg. In 1517, he published a list of 95 Theses, or points to be debated, concerning the illicitness of selling indulgences. Luther had a particular disdain for Aristotelian philosophy, and as he began developing his own theology, he increasingly came into conflict with other scholars. Soon, Luther began to develop his theology of justification, or process by which one is \"made right\" (righteous) in the eyes of God. \nIn Catholic theology, one is made righteous by a progressive infusion of grace accepted through faith and cooperated with through good works. Luther's doctrine of justification was different. He said justification meant \"the declaring of one to be righteous\", where God imputes the merits of Christ upon one who remains without inherent merit. In this process, good works are more of an unessential byproduct that contribute nothing to one's own state of righteousness. Conflict between Luther and leading theologians lead to his gradual rejection of authority of the Church hierarchy. In 1520, he was condemned for heresy by the papal bull \"Exsurge Domine\", which he burned at Wittenburg along with books of canon law.\nJohn Calvin.\nJohn Calvin was a French cleric and doctor of law turned Protestant reformer in the second generation of the Reformation. He was well known for publishing the \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\", in 1536 (later revised), and became a leader of the Reformed church in Geneva, which became an \"unofficial capital\" of Reformed Christianity in the second half of the sixteenth century. He had great authority in the city and over the city council, such that he has (rather ignominiously) been called a \"Protestant pope\". \nCalvin established an eldership together with a \"consistory\", where pastors and the elders established matters of religious discipline for the Genevan population. Calvin's theology is best known for his doctrine of (double) predestination, which held that God had, from all eternity, providentially foreordained who would be saved (the elect) and likewise who would be damned (the reprobate). Predestination was not the dominant idea in Calvin's works, but it would seemingly become so for many of his Reformed successors.\nEnglish Reformation.\nUnlike other reform movements, the English Reformation began by royal influence. Henry VIII considered himself a thoroughly Catholic King, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled, \"The Defense of the Seven Sacraments\", for which Pope Leo X awarded him the title \"Fidei Defensor\" (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with Catherine of Aragon, for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of Emperor Charles V, the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from Rome and the declaration of the King of England as head of the English (Anglican) Church. England then experienced a period of frenetic and eclectic reforms, some more radical and others more traditional, under monarchs such as Edward VI and Elizabeth I, and Archbishops of Canterbury such as Thomas Cranmer and William Laud. What emerged was a state church that considered itself both \"Reformed\" and \"Catholic\" but not \"Roman\" (and hesitated from the title \"Protestant\"), and other \"unofficial\" more radical movements such as the Puritans.\nCounter-Reformation.\nThe Counter-Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation. The essence of the Counter-Reformation was a renewed conviction in traditional practices and the upholding of Catholic doctrine as the source of ecclesiastic and moral reform, and the answer to halting the spread of Protestantism. Thus it experienced the founding of new religious orders, such as the Jesuits, the establishment of seminaries for the proper training of priests, renewed worldwide missionary activity, and the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality, such as that of the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality. The entire process was spearheaded by the Council of Trent, which clarified and reasserted doctrine, issued dogmatic definitions, and produced the \"Roman Catechism\".\nThough Ireland, Spain, France, and elsewhere featured significantly in the Counter-Reformation, its heart was Italy and the various popes of the time, who established the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (the list of prohibited books) and the Roman Inquisition, a system of juridical tribunals that prosecuted heresy and related offences. The Papacy of St. Pius V (1566-1572) was known not only for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church, but also for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals, and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick, and supporting missionaries. The activities of these pontiffs coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome. As Diarmaid MacCulloch stated, \"Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more, Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh, both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe: the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism.\"\nGreat Awakenings.\nThe First Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies \"c\". 1730-1740, emphasizing the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created Pietism in Germany, the Evangelical Revival, and Methodism in England. It centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected Congregational, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, German Reformed, Baptist, and Methodist churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of Restorationist groups such as the Mormons and the Holiness movement. The Third Great Awakening began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the \"great awakenings\" in North America was Pentecostalism, which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on Azusa Street, in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the Charismatic movement.\nRestorationism.\nRestorationism refers to various unaffiliated movements that considered contemporary Christianity, in all its forms, to be a deviation from the true, original Christianity, which these groups then attempted to \"Reconstruct\", often using the Book of Acts as a \"guidebook\" or sorts. Restorationism developed out of the Second Great Awakening and is historically connected to the Protestant Reformation, but differs in that Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as \"restoring\" the Church that they believe was lost at some point. The name Restoration is also used to describe the Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and the Jehovah's Witness Movement.\nFascism.\nFascism describes certain related political regimes in 20th century Europe, especially Nazi Germany. When the Italian government closed Catholic youth organizations, Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical \"Non Abbiamo Bisogno\", saying that Fascist governments had hidden \"pagan intentions\" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and Fascism, which placed the nation above God and fundamental human rights and dignity. He later signed agreements with the new rulers of Italy and Germany. \nMany Catholic priests and monastics were persecuted under the Nazi regime, such as the concentration camp victims Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein (Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross). Furthermore, many Catholic laypeople and clergy helped in sheltering Jews during the Holocaust, including Pope Pius XII. Various incidents, such as giving aid to downed Allied airmen, nearly caused Nazi Germany to invade the Vatican before the liberation of Rome in 1944.\nThe relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the German Lutheran Church, is complex. Though the majority of Protestant church leaders in Germany made little comment on the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.\nFundamentalism.\nFundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and American Protestantism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in reaction to modernism and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves \"Christian\". Thus, fundamentalism sought to reestablish tenants that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the \"fundamentals\": the Bible as God`s word, viewed as the sole source of authority, the virgin birth of Christ, the doctrine of atonement through Jesus, the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and the imminent return of Christ.\nEcumenism.\nEcumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \"Ecumenism\" is derived from Greek \"\" (oikoumene), which means \"the inhabited world\", but more figuratively something like \"universal oneness\". The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterized by a redefined ecclesiology of \"denominationalism\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).\nConcerning the Greek Orthodox Church, steady movement was made to reconcile the East-West Schism. On 30 November 1894, Pope Leo XIII publishes the Apostolic Letter \"Orientalium Dignitas\" (On the Churches of the East) safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of His Holiness Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.\nConcerning Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification produced with the Lutheran World Federation in 1999.\nEcumenical movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfill these basic criteria a (more or less) equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a \"first among equal\" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of \"the Church\" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfills the essential criteria of \"being Christian\") is a sub-group of a greater \"Christian Church\", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e. no group, or \"denomination\", claims to be \"the Church\". Obviously, this ecclesiology it at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be \"the Church\". But moreover, because the \"essential criteria\" generally consist of belief in the holy Trinity, it has resulted in strife between these Protestant ecumenical movements and non-Trinitarian groups such as Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and Jehovah's Witnesses, which are not often not regarded as Christian by these ecumenical groups.\nOther websites.\nThe following links give an overview of the history of Christianity:\nThe following link provides quantitative data related to Christianity and other major religions, including rates of adherence at different points in time:"}

Question marks on dates mean that dates are not exact. \nWestern culture and Christian churches use the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian calendar has been in use since 1582 when it replaced the less precise Julian Calendar. The Gregorian calendar began in Europe, in the reign of Pope Gregory XIII. The Gregorian calendar is now used almost everywhere in the world (except for calculating the holy days of other religions). \nThe Gregorian calendar dates years from before or after the birth of Jesus. Years that are before the birth of Jesus have the initials BC (before Christ) and years that are after (traditionally) have the initials AD (anno Domini \u2013 \"in the year of our Lord\"). Nowadays these are often written BCE (\"before the Common Era\") and CE (\"Common Era\").\nThe \"year one\" is the first year in \"anno Domini\" (the Common Era). There is no year zero. When the Gregorian calendar was calculated, the scholars tried to work out exactly when the birth of Jesus happened. The exact date is not certain, but most agree that it was between 6 BC and 4 BC.\nEra of Jesus.\nThis list tells only about the things that happened in the part of the world where Jesus was born. This region is now called Israel and Palestine. In the time of Jesus, it was under the rule of the Romans.\nJesus began his ministry after his baptism by John and during the rule of Pilate, preaching: \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near\" (). While the historicity of the gospel accounts is questioned to some extent by most critical scholars and non-Christians, the traditional view states the following chronology for his ministry: Temptation, Sermon on the Mount, Appointment of the Twelve, Miracles, Temple Money Changers, Last Supper, Arrest, Trial, Passion, Crucifixion on Good Friday (, ), Nisan 14th (, , Gospel of Peter) or Nisan 15th (Synoptic Gospels), (7 Apr 30, 3 Apr 33, 30 Mar 36, possible Fri-14-Nisan dates \u2013 Meier), entombment by Pharisees Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus of the Sanhedrin, Resurrection by God on Easter Sunday, appearances to Paul of Tarsus (), Simon Peter (), Mary Magdalene (, ), and others, Great Commission, Ascension, Second Coming Prophecy to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment, and establishment of the Kingdom of God and the Messianic Age. See also Chronology of Jesus.\nEra of the Apostles.\nShortly after the Crucifixion of Jesus (Nisan 14 or 15), the Jerusalem church was founded as the first Christian church with about 120 Jews and Jewish proselytes (), followed by Pentecost, the Ananias and Sapphira incident, Pharisee Gamaliel's defense of the Apostles (), the stoning of Saint Stephen (see also Persecution of Christians) and the subsequent dispersal of the church () which led to the baptism of Simon Magus in Samaria (), and also an Ethiopian eunuch (). Paul's conversion to \"Apostle to the Gentiles\" is first recorded in (, cf. ). Peter baptized the Centurion Cornelius, who is traditionally considered the first Gentile convert to Christianity (). The Antioch church was founded. It was there that the term Christian was first used (). Saint James was executed by Agrippa I (ruled 39\u201344) during a Passover (Nisan 15) ().\nEra of the Seven Ecumenical Councils.\nConstantine called the First Council of Nicaea in 325 to unify Christology, also called the first great Christian council by Jerome, the first ecumenical, decreed the Original Nicene Creed, but rejected by Nontrinitarianism such as Arius, Theonas, Secundus, Eusebius of Nicomedia, and Theognis who were excommunicated, also addressed Easter controversy and passed 20 Canon laws."}

There are also some words which are special for particular feast days.\nIn the Renaissance period church composers set the words of the Ordinary mass to music. This music was normally polyphonic: the different sections of the choir (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) all had musical lines which shared the melody and were of equal importance. The words of the Proper were not composed to special music. They were sung to plainchant.\nDuring the last two centuries many composers have written masses which were not meant to be sung in a church service: they are written as concert pieces.

He was one of the greatest composers of his day. He composed lots of music of different kinds. Among his best works are his \"Symphony no 3 (with organ) \", \"Piano Concerto no 2\", \"Violin Concerto no 3\", \"Cello Concerto no 1\", the opera \"Samson and Delilah\" and the \"Danse Macabre\". His most popular work, however, is the \"Carnival of the Animals\". Saint-Saens hated being thought of as \u201cthe composer of the \"Carnival of the Animals\"\". He said he had only written it for a bit of fun and he did not want anyone to perform it. Today it still remains one of the most popular pieces for children.\nLife.\nThree months after Saint-Saens was born his father died. Saint-Saens was often ill with tuberculosis when he was very small and this carried on throughout his life. He was brought up by his mother and his aunt. this illness still didn't hold Saint-Saens back. at the age of two his aunt taught him the piano. When he was ten he played piano concertos by Beethoven and Mozart at a public concert, playing everything from memory. He was very good at school and was interested in lots of subjects including science and philosophy. In 1858 he published some duets for harmonium and piano and he used the money to buy a telescope.\nHe studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and was a brilliant student, although he did not win the Prix de Rome. He soon became known as a composer, pianist and organist and he made many friends, among them Gounod, Berlioz and Rossini. Liszt thought he was the greatest organist in the world. Like Liszt, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was often very kind to other composers and helped them to become known by playing and conducting their music. He was the first person to conduct Liszt\u2019s symphonic poems in France. He himself wrote symphonic poems such as \"Le Rouet d\u2019Omphale\" (1871) and \"Danse Macabre\" (1874). The idea of music which describes a story was quite a new idea at that time. He also helped people to like Bach whose music had been forgotten for a long time.\nIn the 1860s his fame spread and he also did some teaching at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer which educated young musicians for church music. His pupils included Faure, Messager and Gigout who all became lifelong friends. He also founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique which helped new music to be performed. Faure, Cesar Franck and Lalo were all members. The society gave first performances of works by Saint-Saens, Chabrier, Debussy, Dukas and Ravel and others.\nSaint-Saens married a 19-year-old girl. The marriage was not a success. They had two sons who died within six weeks of one another: the baby from an illness and the two-year-old from falling out of a fourth floor window. Saint-Saens blamed his wife and they eventually divorced.\nFor many years Saint-Saens travelled all over the world as a famous musician. Eventually he became less popular in France, but in England and the United States he was still very much admired. He played for Queen Victoria and spent some time studying original manuscripts of Handel in the library of Buckingham Palace. He was awarded the title of Doctor by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and was made a Commander of the Victorian Order because he had composed a march for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. He died in Algiers in 1921. His funeral was in the cathedral there, and his body was then taken back to Paris where he was given a state funeral at the church of Madeleine.\nHis music.\nSaint-Saens was more famous in the concert hall than he was in the theatre. He wrote 13 operas, but only one of them is still regularly performed: \"Samson et Dalila\" (\"Samson and Delilah\"). One of the arias from this opera, \"Mon c\u0153ur s\u2019ouvre \u00e0 ta voix\", is especially famous.\nSaint-Saens wrote many concertos, symphonies, sonatas and chamber music. He often uses the style of dance music and creates a happy atmosphere by repeating certain patterns. His music is late Romantic, but based on the classical traditions rather than following the style of Wagner like many other French composers were doing at the time."}

Its members are Korean American Brian Joo and South Korean Fany (also known as Hwanhee; Korean: \ud658\ud76c Chinese: \u6b61\u559c; meaning \"delight\"). Since their 1999 debut single \"Day by Day,\" they released six albums. Although they were marketed as teen idols, the duo later changed their image and style with their third album \"Sea of Love\" in 2002. With their future albums, the duo became known as R&amp;B artists and are known as the first R&amp;B duo of South Korea.\nCareer.\n1999-2001.\nThe duo started in late 1998 by Korean record company SM Entertainment. A friend of Brian Joo signed him up for auditions with Brothers Entertainment without his knowledge. while he was going to Holy Spirit High School, a Roman Catholic school in New Jersey. As for Fany, a staff member working for the company recommended him to audition at a school festival. \nTheir first appeared on television on December 9, 1999. Their first album \"Day by Day\" sold over 250,000 copies.\nTheir second album \"The Promise\" was released in 2001. The album hit #2 on the charts, but it quickly slipped from the charts. In the same year, they had their first concert with singer Kim Jo-Han.\n2002-2004.\nThe duo released two albums during this time. Their third album \"Sea of Love\" was released while Joo was at New Jersey going to Rutgers University, so Fany performed the songs by himself. The album featured \"Condition of My Heart\" which was written by American singer Brian McKnight.\nTheir fourth album, \"Missing You\" came out around the time when his manager died in a car crash. Fany was especially shocked by his death, because he had been in the same car with his manager just hours before the incident.\n\"Gravity\", as their fifth and last album, came out by SM Entertainment. Their contract to the company ended soon after the release.\n2004-present.\nFly to the Sky signed on with PFull Entertainment after their first contract ended in 2004. They wanted a smaller label that cared less about money. Fly to the Sky recorded their sixth studio album \"Transition\" in January 2006.\nThe duo started their first tour in Korea called \"Fly To The Sky: 2006 The Twice Tour\". Starting from Jamsil Arena in Seoul in May 2006, they had concerts in major Korean cities like Busan, Daegu, Junju, and Kwangju.\nWhen \"Transition\" became popular, Fly to the Sky made a special edition, which had more music videos, deleted scenes and the more songs titled \"Hwan Sang (Illusion),\" \"Hot and Cold,\" and \"When I Say.\"\nIn 2004 and 2005, there was a rumor that they would break up. Brian denied to rumours and said that Fly to the Sky was not disbanding. He said the two had hard time getting along for first few years of their career on the show \"Yah Shim Man Man,\" which aired on July 10. He said that he felt envy towards Fany, because he received more attention and praise than him. Brian felt that he was not given his due as Fany. Eventually he found this difficult to bear, and suggested to Fany that they pursue their separate paths. Fany responded angrily and that led to a fight that nearly led to the duo breaking up. The two was on good terms again soon after, understanding each other better. After the fight, the two decided to try to better understand each other in order to solve their problems together and to support each other. Brian's eyes were filled with tears when he was talking about the rumour.\nSince 2006, the duo has appeared many times in variety shows. Fany appeared on Korean television drama \"Over the Rainbow\" during summer of 2006, and Brian released his solo album \"The Brian\" in December 2006. They became more popular but some critics and fans said they were compromising their image as artists.\nOther websites.\nThe websites are in Korean."}

{"id": "54516", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54516", "title": "Bram Stoker", "text": "Abraham \"Bram\" Stoker (8 November 1847 \u2013 20 April 1912) was an Irish writer. He is best remembered as the author of the classical and influential vampire (or devil) novel \"Dracula\".\nLife.\nHe was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent\u2014then as now called \"The Crescent\"\u2014in Clontarf, a coastal suburb of Dublin, Ireland. His parents were Abraham Stoker (born in 1799; married Stoker's mother in 1844; died on 10 October 1876) and the feminist Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley (born in 1818; died in 1901). Stoker was the third of seven children. Abraham and Charlotte were members of the Church of Ireland and attended the Clontarf parish church (St. John the Baptist) with their children where both were baptised. Until he started school at the age of seven\u2014when he made a complete, surprising recovery\u2014Stoker was sick. During that time, Stoker wrote, \"I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years.\"\nAfter his recovery, he became a normal young man even excelling as an athlete at Trinity College, Dublin (1864\u201370), from which he was graduated with honors in mathematics. He was auditor of the College Historical Society and president of the University Philosophical Society, where his first paper was on \"Sensationalism in Fiction and Society\". In 1876, while he was employed as a civil servant in Dublin, he wrote theater reviews for \"The Dublin Mail\", a newspaper partly owned by fellow horror writer J. Sheridan Le Fanu. His interest in theater led to a lifelong friendship with the English actor Henry Irving. In 1878 Stoker married Florence Balcombe, a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was Oscar Wilde. The couple moved to London, where Stoker became business manager of Irving's Lyceum Theater, a post he held for 27 years. The collaboration with Irving was very important for Stoker. Through him he became involved in London's high society, where he met, among other notables, James McNeil Whistler and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the course of Irving's tours he got the chance to travel around the world.\nThey had one son, Irving Noel Stoker, who was born on 31 December 1879.\nDracula.\nHe earned his money by writing a large number of sensational novels, his most famous being the vampire tale \"Dracula\" which he published in 1897. Before writing \"Dracula\", Stoker spent eight years researching European folklore and stories of vampires. \"Dracula\" is an epistolary novel, written as collection of diary entries, telegrams, and letters from the characters, as well as fictional clippings from the Whitby and London newspapers. Stoker's inspiration for the story was a visit to Slains Castle near Aberdeen. The bleak spot provided an excellent backdrop for his creation.\n\"Dracula\" has been the basis for countless movies and plays. The first was \"Nosferatu\" directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlock. \"Nosferatu\" was produced while Florence Stoker, Bram Stoker's widow and literary executrix, was still alive. Represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors, she eventually sued the filmmakers. Her chief legal complaint was that she had been neither asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years, with Mrs Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the movie. The suit was finally resolved in the widow's favour in July 1925. Some copies of the movie survived, however, and \"Nosferatu\" is now widely regarded as an innovative classic. The most famous movie version of \"Dracula\" is the 1931 production starring Bela Lugosi and which spawned several sequels that had little to do with Stoker's novel.\nStoker wrote several other novels dealing with horror and supernatural themes, but none of them achieved the lasting fame or success of \"Dracula\". His other novels include \"The Snake's Pass\" (1890), \"The Jewel of Seven Stars\" (1903), and \"The Lair of the White Worm\" (1911)."}

It first aired in Japan from October 13 1997 to December 22, 1997 every Monday. It had a very high rating of 30.8%. It features music by Cagnet.\nSummary.\nThe show revolves around the relationship of the two leading characters, Katagiri Teppei and Uesugi Riko, who begin their relationship as squabbling colleagues before falling in love. Katagiri Teppei is a talented designer and very popular among women. Unfortunately, Teppei, who despises anything boring and repetitive, is forced to move to the sales department for his egocentric behavior. Throughout the series, he is forced to adapt to the new working environment, which includes cutting his precious locks of hair to create a neater and more professional image. As he struggles to adapt, he meets Uesugi Riko. While she does not like him at first, she eventually falls for him. However, Teppei runs into his highschool sweetheart Mizuhara Sanae, and discovers that his ex-girlfriend is now engaged to his brother Soichiro. Fortunately, Riko is there to console him, and this eventually blooms into a romance. Not long after, however, Sanae realizes she still has feelings for Teppei, and thus creates a love triangle. To make the matter even more complicated, Soichiro starts to have an affair with his past girlfriend.\nSymbols.\nCrystal apple.\nTeppei's apartment has many unusual items such as Thai artifact, a 30-year-old refrigerator, and a crystal apple. The meaning behind the apple is that there is only one true love, between Adam and Eve, that is. A crystal can be broken easily, and when one would look in it, it appears upside down. The apple is seen upside down for the 10 of the 11 episodes. At the last episode, however, the apple is no longer upside down. The apple is on the album cover of the soundtrack for \"Love Generation\".\nTrue love never runs smooth.\nThe advertising poster appears over and over again. The model is holding a crystal apple, and reads \"True love never runs smooth\" symbolizing the relationship between Riko and Teppei, which constantly faces struggles from when they meet for the very first time to the love triangle. This advertisement is visible everywhere from the park to Teppei's 30-year-old refrigerator, as \"True love never runs smooth\" is the unofficial tagline of this television series."}

They are the segmented worms, with over 17,000 known species.\nWell known species are earthworms and leeches. Annelids can be found in most wet environments. Some of these species are parasitic or mutualistic. This means they live together with (or inside) another organism. A mutualistic relationship is beneficial to both organisms. Their size varies from under a millimetre to about 3 metres. The largest known species is the seep tube worm (\"Lamellibrachia lymnesi\"), which is related to the giant tube worm.\nAnnelids are made of one or more body segments. Each segment has one or more rings. These rings are called \"annuli\" (singular: 'annulus' = 'little ring'). Annelids reproduce sexually by hermaphroditic cross-fertilization. They can regenerate cut off pieces of their body, unlike sponges, which can come back together if ripped apart. They have a hydrostatic skeleton, a one-way digestion system, and bilateral symmetry.\nNervous system.\nAnnelid worms have a nervous system. The brain forms a ring round the pharynx (throat), consisting of a pair of ganglia (local control centers) above and in front of the pharynx, linked by nerve cords either side of the pharynx to another pair of ganglia just below and behind it. In some very mobile and active polychaetes the brain is enlarged and more complex, with visible hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain sections.\nThe rest of the central nervous system is usually 'ladder-like', with a pair of nerve cords that run along the bottom part of the body cavity.

There are more than 10,000 known species in this class. They are ancient animals, dating back to 518 million years ago. They are first found in the early Cambrian fossil beds of Sirius Passet in Greenland.\nEach of their body segments has some fleshy protrusions that stand out. These 'parapodia' have many bristles, which are made of chitin. This is different from the Oligochaeta, which are similar in form, but only have a few bristles.\nCommon species are the lugworm, and the clam worm \"Nereis\" (which is sometimes also called a 'sandworm').\nDescription.\nPolychaetes are segmented worms, generally less than in length, although ranging at the extremes from to . They are often brightly coloured, and may be iridescent or even luminescent.\nEach segment bears a pair of paddle-like parapodia, which are used for movement. In many species, the parapodia, well supplied with blood vessels, act as the worm's primary respiratory surfaces. Bundles of bristles stick out from the parapodia.\nSome bristle worms have poison bristles. The bristles will break off in the skin of a predator that tries to pick up the animal and sting the predator painfully.\nThe head, or prostomium, is relatively well developed, compared with other annelids. It is forward over the mouth, which lies on the animal's underside. The head normally includes two to four pair of eyes, although there are some blind species. These eyes are fairly simple structures, capable of distinguishing between light and dark. Some species have large eyes with lenses that may be capable of real vision.\nThe head also includes a pair of antennae, tentacle-like palps, and a pair of pits lined with cilia, known as \"nuchal organs\". These latter appear to be chemoreceptors which help the worm seek out food.\nEcology.\nPolychaetes vary in form and lifestyle. Most burrow or build tubes in the sediment, some swim among the plankton, and some live as commensals. A few are parasitic.\nThe mobile forms tend to have well-developed sense organs and jaws, while the stationary forms lack them, but may have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration and deposit or filter feeding, e.g., fanworms.\nA few groups have evolved to live in terrestrial environments, but are restricted to humid areas. Some have even evolved tubes that open inwards from the skin which work like simple lungs, absorbing oxygen from the air and allowing release of waste gases.\nBristle worm diet.\nMost bristle worms are scavengers, but some are good predators, eating fishes and coral. Others like to eat algae. They are usually found hiding in reefs and rocky places. They crawl along the sea floor or the bottom of a tide pool, looking for something to eat."}

They have two forms, the sea lilies, stalked forms attached to the sea floor, and the feather stars, which are free-living.\nAll crinoids are marine, and live both in shallow water and in depths as great as 6000 meters. The basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognized, but most crinoids have many more than five arms. Crinoids have a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms.\nThe crinoids have a long history. They were the first echinoderms to appear in the fossil record, and have kept their early structure throughout their long career. They were extremely common in the Palaeozoic, and some rocks from the Carboniferous consist almost entirely of fossil crinoids.\nAnatomy.\nCrinoids' mouths faces up towards the surface of the ocean, and the stalked forms feed on the detritus which comes down to the bottom. The mouth is surrounded by many feathery tentacles. They have a U-shaped gut, and their anus is located next to the mouth.\nHistory.\nThe crinoids were almost wiped out by the extinction event at the end of the Palaeozoic era. Four whole classes became extinct, and the few that survived became the only living class, the Articulata. The stalked members of the class sufered from heavy predation in the Mesozoic. and now all the remaining sea lilies are in deep water, where the competition is less fierce. The feather stars have been much more successful.\nIn 2005, a stalked crinoid was recorded pulling itself along the sea floor off the Grand Bahama Island. The recording showed a crinoid moving at much faster speeds than was thought possible.\nFeather stars.\nThe free-living feather stars first appear in the Upper Triassic. They are related to starfish. As juveniles, they are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk, as their ancestors were. In the adult stage they break away from the stalk and can move about. Some can swim by undulating movements of the arms. Usually, feather stars creep about by using projections at the bottom of the crown, called cirri. They are the only crinoids in shallow water, and are all in the Order Comatulidae. Their flexible arms and ability to choose their feeding grounds was undoubtedly important in their success and survival.p293\nDuring the day, they roll into a ball. But at night, they spread out their arms to catch plankton.\nFeather stars arrange themselves so the fan faces the flow of the current. The posture serves to present the maximum area of food-collecting surfaces to the incoming water flow, so that more particles will settle on them. They are found mostly in shallow water."}

The methane in bio gas burns more cleanly than coal, and produces more energy with less emissions of carbon dioxide. The harvesting of bio gas is an important role of waste management because methane is a greenhouse gas with a greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide. The carbon in bio gas was generally recently extracted from the atmosphere by photosynthetic plants, so releasing it back into the atmosphere adds less total atmospheric carbon than the burning of fossil fuels.\nBiogas typical composition range.\nThe composition of biogas varies depending on how it is made.

Dismissal means that someone is allowed to leave. In this case, people are being allowed to leave because Mass is finished. In another sense, it also means that people are allowed to leave to go on a mission to tell other people about Jesus and Christianity.\nCatholic Church.\nMass is the most important ceremony and form of worship in the Catholic Church. The Eucharist is thought to be the most important part of Christian life because that is when the blood and body of Christ is received in the form of bread and wine as a sacrifice.\nA Sunday Mass is about an hour long. On other days, it is about half an hour. A Mass can be longer or shorter depending on how many people there are taking Communion.\nA good Catholic is supposed to go to Mass every Sunday and on some other holy days. Even though Mass can be on other days, a Catholic is still supposed to go to one on Sunday.\nThere are four parts in a Catholic Mass. They are all the same all around the world but in different languages. The four parts are the Introductory Rites, the Liturgy of the Word, the Liturgy of the Eucharist, and Concluding Rites.\nIntroductory Rites.\nThe priest comes in and everyone does the sign of the cross. He greets everyone in the congregation. Then people confess their sins together and ask the Lord for mercy. After that, they sing the hymn Gloria and the priest says a prayer called the collect.\nLiturgy of the Word.\nIn this part of Mass, some parts of the Bible are read. They are a first reading (which can be from either the Old or New Testament), a psalm, a second reading from the New Testament, and a reading from the Gospel. Then the priest will have a short sermon (homily). After that, the Apostles' Creed is said. Finally, some intercessory prayers can be made on behalf on another person.\nLiturgy of the Eucharist.\nDuring the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the bread and wine is offered at the altar. The priest consecrates them, which is when he says that they are the body (bread) and blood (wine) of Jesus. According to the teachings of the Catholic Church, this turns them into the actual blood and body of Christ (transubstantiation) even though they still look, smell, and taste like bread and wine.\nAfter this, the Lord's Prayer is said. Next, people in the congregation do a sign of peace (usually a nod or handshake while saying \"peace\" or \"peace be with you\") with one another to show that they are now one family in Christ. The bread and wine are then eaten in a process called Communion. Only baptized Catholics who are sorry for their sins are allowed to take part in Communion.\nAfter Communion, there is a prayer to give thanks to God.\nConcluding Rites.\nThere may be announcements about important things going on in the parish during this time.\nThe priest blesses everyone and dismisses them.\nOther websites.\nRoman Catholic doctrine\nPresent form of the Roman rite of the Mass\nTridentine form of the Roman rite of the Mass\nAnglican Doctrine and practice\nLutheran doctrine"}
{"id": "54640", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54640", "title": "Woodpecker", "text": "The woodpeckers and its near relatives the piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers are the family Picidae. They are near-passerine birds. Members of the Picidae are found worldwide, except for the parts of old Gondwana which they did not get to: Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and Antarctica. Most species live in forests or woodland habitats.\nThe Picidae are just one of the eight living families in the order Piciformes. DNA sequence analyses have shown they are a clade.\nThere are about 240 species and about 35 genera in this family. Many species are threatened or endangered due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation.\nHabits.\nAll the special features (traits) of the woodpeckers are adaptations to their mode of life.\nMembers of the family Picidae have strong bills for drilling and drumming on trees and long sticky tongues for extracting food. The bills of piculets and wrynecks are shorter, and less strong and sharp than those of woodpeckers, but their morphology is very similar.\nWoodpeckers operate mainly on tree trunks, staying in place propped up by their stiff tail feathers. Piculets and wrynecks live mainly on the branches, and they lack the stiffened tail feathers.\nThe woodpecker bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action on wood. With their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which have bristles, help the birds grab and extracting insects from deep in a hole of a tree. Detailed studies published in 2004 showed that the tongue wraps around the prey before being pulled out.\nPreventing brain damage.\nMany of the foraging, breeding and signalling behaviours of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using the bill. To prevent brain damage from the rapid and repeated decelerations, woodpeckers have a number of adaptations which protect the brain. These include small brain size, the orientation of the brain within the skull (which spreads the area of contact between the brain and the skull) and the short duration of contact.\nThe unequal length of the upper and lower parts of their beaks (the lower being longer), serves to steer the impact force downwards, away from the brain. Also, the woodpecker\u2019s brain is held in a skull with uneven, spongy plates that absorb shock. Third, woodpeckers have a special hyoid bone, which reaches from their beak, loops over top of the skull to completely surround their brains. This acts to keep the brain in place. It is the movement of the brain inside the skull during impact, more than the blow itself, that causes concussions. If the brain is held in place, injury risks are greatly reduced.\nOther adaptations.\nThe millisecond before contact with wood a thickened nictitating membrane closes, protecting the eye from flying debris. The nostrils are also protected; they are often slit-like and have special feathers to cover them.\nWoodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all have zygodactyl feet. These feet have four toes, the first and the fourth face backward, and the second and third face forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk. In addition to the strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. The tails of all woodpeckers except the piculets and wrynecks are stiffened, and when the bird perches on vertical surfaces, the tail and feet work together to support it.\nWrynecks.\nThe wrynecks (genus \"Jynx\") are two species of small Old World woodpeckers.\nThey are very similar to true woodpeckers, but lack the stiff tail feathers that woodpeckers use when climbing trees. They are more likely to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk. Their bills are shorter and less dagger-like than in the true woodpeckers. Their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or almost bare soil. They re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.\nThese birds can turn their heads almost 180 degrees. When disturbed at the nest, they use this snake-like head twisting and hissing as a threat display. This odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft, hence to put a \"jinx\" on someone."}

They generally do not have a cell nucleus, nuclear membrane or cell organelles, however a small number of exceptions have been found. They possess genetic material in the form of a single DNA loop known as Nucleoid. Bacteria include the Cyanobacteria (formerly known as blue-green algae due to their photosynthetic capacity).\nSome form biofilms that are somewhat like multicellular organisms.\nBesides a nucleus, prokaryotes lack other things eukaryotes (cells with a true nucleus) have. They reproduce without fusion of gametes. They do not have membranes inside the cell. This means that there are no vacuoles, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticula or other organelles inside the cell. However, they do have ribosomes, though of a simpler kind than eukaryotes. Eukaryote cells include organelles which were once free-living prokaryotes.\nTaxonomy.\nIn 1977, Carl Woese proposed dividing prokaryotes into the Bacteria and Archaea (originally Eubacteria and Archaebacteria) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms. This arrangement of Eukaryota (also called \"Eukarya\"), Bacteria, and Archaea is called the three-domain system, replacing the traditional two-empire system.\nThe Archaea include simple organisms which were first discovered in extreme environments. Most of them can survive at very high or very low temperatures. Some of them can also survive in highly salty, acidic or alkaline water. Some have been found in geysers, black smokers or oil wells.\nThe prokaryotes may not be a monophyletic, taxonomic group of common descent, but merely a group of similar organisms. The relationships between Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukaryota are assessed differently by different scientists. The three-domain system of Carl Woese treats them as one monophyletic group."}

He was the son of \"Zebedee\" and \"Salome\" and brother of John the Evangelist. He is called Saint James the Greater to distinguish (mark as different) him from the other apostle named James \n(James, son of Alphaeus). James is described as one of the first disciples who joined Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels tell that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to begin traveling (Mt.4:21\u201322, Mk.1:19\u201320). According to Mark, James and John were called \"Boanerges\", or the \"Sons of Thunder\" (3:17). Acts of the Apostles 12:1\u20132 records that King Herod had James executed by sword (Ac.12:1\u20132). He was likely the first of the apostles martyred for his faith.\nSaint James and Hispania.\nAccording to ancient local tradition, on 2 January of the year AD 40, the Virgin Mary appeared to James on the bank of the Ebro River at Caesaraugusta, while he was preaching the Gospel in Spain. She supposedly appeared upon a pillar, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar, and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, in Zaragoza, Spain. Following that apparition, St James returned to Judea, where he was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa I in the year 44. \nThe translation of his relics from Judea to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was effected, in legend, by a series of miraculous happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to Iria Flavia in Spain, where a massive rock closed around his relics, which were later removed to Compostela. The 12th-century \"Historia Compostellana\" gives a summary of the legend of St James as it was believed at Compostela. Two ideas are central to it: first, that St James preached the gospel in Spain as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa I his disciples carried his body by sea to Spain, where they landed at Padr\u00f3n on the coast of Galicia, and took it inland for burial at Santiago de Compostela. \nThe authenticity of the sacred relics of Compostela was asserted in the Bull of Pope Leo XIII, \"Omnipotens Deus,\" of 1 November 1884. \nThe tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king Alfonso II (791\u2013842) and of bishop Theodemir of Iria. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the shrine dedicated to James at Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia in Spain, became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world. St James's Way is a tree of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain. Eventually James became the patron saint of Spain.\nThe name \"James\" in English comes from \"Iacobus\" (Jacob) in Latin. In eastern Spain, Jacobus became \"Jacome\" or \"Jaime\"; in Catalunya, it became Jaume, in western Spain it became \"Iago\", and Portugal and Galicia it was Tiago. \"Saint James\" (\"Sanctus Jacobus\") became \"Sant' Iago\", which was abbreviated to \"Santiago\". James's emblem was the scallop shell (or \"cockle shell\"), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes."}

It can be found throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world.\nIt has special filaments it can retract; because of this, it has been placed in its own order: \"Vampyromorphida\" (formerly \"Vampyromorpha\"). It is similar to both squid and octopus. It is the only surviving member of its order. It was first described and mistakenly identified as an octopus in 1903.\nPhysical description.\nThe vampire squid can grow to about 30\u00a0cm (1 foot) in total length. It is no threat to humans. Its 15\u00a0cm (6 inch) gelatinous body varies in color between velvety jet-black and pale reddish, depending on location and lighting conditions. A webbing of skin connects its eight arms, each lined with rows of fleshy spines or \"cirri\". The inside of this \"cloak\" is black. Only the distal half (farthest from the body) of the arms have suckers. Its limpid, globular eyes\u2014which appear red or blue, also depending on lighting\u2014are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at 2.5\u00a0cm (1 inch) in diameter.\nMature adults have a pair of ear-like fins. These fins stand out from the lateral sides of the mantle. They serve as the adult's primary means of propulsion (moving around): Vampire Squid are said to \"fly\" through the water by way of flapping their fins. Their powerful beak-like jaws are as white as ivory. Within the webbing are two pouches. These pouches hide the tactile \"velar filaments\". The filaments are analogous to a true squid's tentacles, extending well past the arms, however, they are a different arm pair than the squid's tentacles. Instead, the filaments are the same pair that were lost by the ancestral octopuses.\nThe Vampire Squid is covered entirely in light-producing organs called photophores. The animal has great control over the organs. It is capable of producing disorienting flashes of light for fractions of a second to several minutes in duration. The intensity and size of the photophores can also be varied. Appearing as small white discs, the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins. They are absent from the underside of the caped arms. Two larger white areas on top of the head were initially believed to be photophores too, but have turned out to be photoreceptors.\nThe chromatophores (pigment organs) common to most cephalopods are poorly developed in Vampire Squid. While this means the animal is not capable of changing its skin colour in the dramatic fashion of shallow-dwelling cephalopods, such trickery is not needed at the pitch black depths in which it lives.\nHabitat and adaptations.\nThe Vampire Squid is an extreme example of a deep-sea cephalopod. People think it lives at aphotic (lightless) depths from 600\u2013900 metres (2,000-3,000 feet) or more. Within this region of the world's oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Within the OMZ oxygen saturation is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most higher organisms. Nonetheless, the Vampire Squid is able to live normally in the OMZ at oxygen saturations as low as 3%; something no other cephalopod\u2014and few other animals\u2014can do.\nIn order to cope with life in this habitat, vampire squid have developed several radical adaptations. Of all deep-sea cephalopods, their metabolic rate is the lowest. Their blue blood hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen most efficiently, aided by gills with especially large surface area. The animals have weak musculature but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort thanks to sophisticated statocysts (balancing organs akin to a human's inner ear) and ammonium-rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the density of the surrounding seawater.\nAt the shallower end of the Vampire Squid's vertical range, the view from below is like the sky at twilight: The highly sensitive eyes of deepwater dwellers are able to distinguish the silhouettes of other animals moving overhead. To combat this, the vampire squid generates its own bluish light (bioluminescence) in a strategy called counterillumination: The light diffuses the animal's silhouette, effectively \"cloaking\" its presence from the watchful eyes below. Its own large eyes detect even the faintest of gleams. A pair of photoreceptors are located on top of its head, perhaps alerting the animal to movements above.\nLike other deep-sea cephalopods, Vampire Squid have no ink sacs. If threatened, instead of ink, a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light is ejected from the arm tips. This luminous barrage, which may last nearly 10 minutes, is presumably meant to daze would-be predators and allow the Vampire Squid to disappear into the blackness without the need to swim far. The display is made only if the animal is very agitated.\nDevelopment.\nTheir development goes through three forms: the very young animals have a single pair of fins, an intermediate form has two pairs, and the mature form again has one. As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops, the fins are resized and repositioned in order to maximize gait efficiency. Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by jet propulsion, mature adults find flapping their fins to be the most efficient means. This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past, with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families (Young 2002).\nThe Vampire Squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs. Growth is slow as food is not abundant at depths where the animals live. The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make procreative encounters a fortuitous event. The female may store a male's hydraulically implanted spermatophore (a sort of tapered, cylindrical satchel of sperm) for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs. Once she does, she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch. The female will not eat towards this culmination and dies shortly thereafter.\nHatchlings are about 8\u00a0mm in length and are well-developed miniatures of the adults, with some differences. Their arms lack webbing, their eyes are smaller and their velar filaments are not fully formed. The hatchlings are transparent and survive on a generous internal yolk for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed. The smaller animals frequent much deeper waters, perhaps feeding on marine snow (falling organic detritus).\nBehavior.\nWhat behavioral data known has been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with ROVs; animals are often damaged during capture and survive for no more than about two months in aquaria. An artificial environment makes reliable observation of non-defensive behavior difficult.\nWith their long velar filaments deployed, Vampire Squid have been observed drifting along in the deep, black ocean currents. If the filaments contact an entity, or if vibrations impinge upon them, the animals investigate with rapid acrobatic movements. They are capable of swimming at speeds equivalent to two body lengths per second, with an acceleration time of five seconds. However, their weak muscles limit stamina considerably.\nUnlike their relatives living in more hospitable depths, deep-sea cephalopods cannot afford to spend energy in protracted flight. Given their low metabolic rate and the low density of prey at such depths, Vampire Squid must use innovative predator avoidance tactics in order to save energy. Their aforementioned bioluminescent \"fireworks\" are combined with the writhing of glowing arms, erratic movements and escape trajectories. These features make it difficult for a predator to home in.\nIn a threat response called \"pumpkin\" or \"pineapple posture\", the Vampire Squid inverts its caped arms back over the body, presenting an ostensibly larger form covered in fearsome-looking though harmless spines (called cirri). The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented, masking most of the body's photophores. The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animal's head, diverting attack away from critical areas. If a predator were to bite off an arm tip, the Vampire Squid can regenerate it.\nCopepods, prawns and cnidarians have all been reported as prey of Vampire Squid. Little else is known regarding their feeding habits. Considering their environment,they are unlikely to be picky about food. Vampire Squid have been found among the stomach contents of large deepwater fish, deep diving whales and pinnipeds such as sea lions.\nRelationships.\nThe Vampyromorphida are characterized by the possession of photophores, a peculiar type of uncalcified endoskeleton called \"gladius\", 8 webbed arms and the 2 velar filaments. Until fairly recently known only from the modern species and some fossil remains tentatively allocated to this group, a batch of kirbys from the Middle Jurassic c.165-164 million years ago (mya) specimens found at La Voulte-sur-Rh\u00f4ne demonstrated that clearly vampyromorphid cephalopods were in existence for far longer than has been hitherto believed. These were described as \"Vampyronassa rhodanica\".\nThe supposed vampyromorphids from Solnhofen limestone (156-146 mya), \"Plesioteuthis prisca\", \"Leptoteuthis gigas\", and \"Trachyteutis hastiformis\", are large species, and show features not found in vampyromorphids. They are similar to the true squids, Teuthida (Fischer &amp; Riou 2002)."}

The process can occur either naturally, or it can be intentional. If it occurs naturally, it is the result of cold (as can be found in a glacier), acid (as can be found in a bog) or dryness. The Egyptians wrapped bandages around the corpse to protect the body from rotting. \nMummies of humans and other animals have been found on every continent, but as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats. They used a hook to remove the brain from taking it out from the nose and they would surgically remove all other organs but the heart, as this was needed for the weighing of the heart ceremony. The organs would then be buried with the mummy in separate containers called canopic jars. \nIntentional mummification.\nIntentional mummification was common in ancient Egypt, for burying Egyptian pharaohs. Osiris was probably the first mummy in Egypt. \nIt takes about 70 days to complete the mummification of a dead body. The first step is to push a sharp rod up the nose and into the brain. From there, the brain is broken up into tiny pieces and removed through the nose, and then the nose is filled with sawdust. Next, they make a hole in the body to remove all the organs except for the heart. Jars which had the heads of gods on top were used to store the organs. The hole was then filled with linen and spices and the body was left under salt to become dry. Later, after 40 days the body was wrapped in linen bandages. Priests surrounded the body while it was being prepared and performed rituals. After the mummifying process was complete, a mask was placed over the head so it could be known in the afterlife.\n\u00d6tzi the Iceman a mummy of a man who lived about 5,300 years ago was found to be naturally mummified by ice. \u00d6tzi was found in 1991 in the Schnalstal glacier, \u00d6tzti Alps, near Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy.\nMummies in Egypt.\nThere were no restrictions on who could be mummified. Any Egyptian who could afford to pay for the expensive process of preserving their bodies for the afterlife was allowed to mummify themselves. Egyptians believed in life after death, and that death was just a transition from one life to another. They believed that they had to preserve their bodies so they could lead a new life. They would need all the things they had used when they were alive so their family would put those things in their grave. Egyptians paid vast amounts of money to have their bodies properly preserved. It took a very long time from start to finish. It took them 70 days to embalm a body. Canonical jars were used by Egyptians to hold the internal organs. It was very important to Egyptian religion that the human body was preserved. Anubis was a god of mummification, he had a human body and a head of a jackal. His job was to prepare the body of the dead to be received by Osiris, the god of the dead. Osiris will then let the souls on and into the underworld. "}

It usually has a glass or translucent plastic roof. Many greenhouses also have glass or plastic walls. Greenhouses warm up during the day via penetration of the sun's rays which heat the plants, soil and structure. This heat is given up gradually throughout the night.\nTypes of greenhouses.\nGreenhouses come in many shapes and sizes, with different functions. Some people have small greenhouses in their backyard, or as a lean-to attached to their home, called mini greenhouses, or tomato houses. They want to start off their seeds and seedlings in a protected environment as well as those growing plants that need warmer conditions. Others, wishing to extend their living space, have house extensions in the form of mini-conservatories. Commercial companies usually have larger greenhouses for horticultural purposes, but have more substantial structures for plant displays where the public is admitted. For the same reason, botanic gardens usually have a high proportion of greenhouses with substantial structures.\nRole of greenhouses.\nMany vegetables and flowers are grown in greenhouses in late winter and early spring, when it is still too cold to grow plants outside. Then these plants move into the soil outside as the weather warms up. Greenhouses are used to grow crops in cold countries such as Canada. The largest group of greenhouses in the world is in Leamington, Ontario (in Canada), where about 200 acres (0.8\u00a0km\u00b2) of tomatoes are grown in glass greenhouses.\nGardening in greenhouses.\nGardening and growing plants in greenhouses is different from growing plants outside as no rain can get inside a greenhouse, so gardeners have to water plants. Also, greenhouses can get very hot from the sun's heat, so gardeners have to make sure that it does not get too hot for the plants. Greenhouses usually have vents that can be opened to let excess heat out. Some greenhouses have electric exhaust fans that automatically turn on if it gets too hot in the greenhouse. A greenhouse is the place for tender plants such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and aubergines.\nHistory.\nRoman gardeners grew cucumbers in frames covered with oiled cloth or with sheets of mica. In the 1500s, Italian gardeners built structures for the tropical plants that explorers brought back to Italy. Jules Charles built the first modern greenhouse in Holland. In the 1800s, large greenhouses were built in England. The greenhouse concept also appeared in the Netherlands and then England in the 17th century"}

It is covered in fur and spines. It has a special nose (snout) and a special tongue that lets the echidna catch its prey at a great speed. It lays eggs, like the other monotremes.\nThe echidna lives throughout Australia, and in coastal and highland regions of southwestern New Guinea. In Australia, it is the most widespread native mammal. It is not threatened with extinction, but human activities, such as hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of foreign predators and parasites, have reduced its range.\nDistribution.\nThe animal was first described in 1792. \"Tachyglossus\" means \"fast tongue\". This is about the speed with which the echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites. The word \"aculeatus\" means \"spiny\" or \"having spines\".\nThe long-beaked echidna are all bigger than \"T. aculeatus\". They eat mostly worms and grubs, rather than ants and termites.\nThere are five subspecies of the short-beaked echidna. Each live in a different area from the others. The subspecies are also different from each other as to hairiness, spine length and width, and the size of the claws on their back feet.\nDescription.\nShort-beaked echidnas are usually 30 to 45\u00a0centimetres in length. They have a 75-millimetre beak, and weigh between two and five kilograms. The Tasmanian subspecies, \"T. a. setosus\", is larger than the Australian mainland species.\nBecause the neck cannot be seen, the head and body appear to join together. The earholes are on either side of the head, with no external pinnae. The eyes are small and at the base of the wedge-shaped beak. The nostrils and the mouth are at the far end of the beak.\nThe legs of this echidna are adapted for rapid digging. Their legs are short and have strong claws. The claws on the back feet are longer and curve backwards to help cleaning and grooming between the spines. Like the platypus it has a low body temperature\u2014between 30 and 32\u00a0\u00b0C. Unlike the platypus, which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation, the body temperature of the echidna may fall as low as 5\u00a0\u00b0C. The echidna does not pant or sweat and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions. In autumn and winter the echidna shows periods of torpor or deep hibernation. Because of its low body temperature, the animal becomes sluggish in very hot and very cold weather.\nThe muscles of this echidna have a number of unusual features. There is an enormous muscle that is just beneath the skin and covers the entire body. By contraction of various parts of this muscle the Short-beaked Echidna can change shape. The most common shape change is achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened, protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines. It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal, extending only as far as the thorax.\nTongue.\nThe tongue of the short-beaked echidna is the animal's only way of catching prey. It can stick out up to 180\u00a0mm outside the snout. The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein-rich mucous. This mucus both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites, which stick to it. The protruded tongue is stiffened by the rapid flow of blood, allowing it to penetrate wood and soil. Retraction requires the contraction of two internal muscles. When the tongue is retracted, the prey is caught on backward-facing keratinous \"teeth\" along the roof of the buccal cavity. This allows the animal to both capture and grind food. The tongue moves with great speed, and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute.\nGeneral physiology.\nMany physiological adaptations fit the animal to its lifestyle. It burrows, and can tolerate high levels of carbon dioxide. Its ear is sensitive to low-frequency sound, which may be ideal for detecting sounds emitted by termites and ants underground. The leathery snout is covered in mechano- and thermoreceptors. These receptors provide information about the surrounding environment. The echidna has a well-developed olfactory system, which may be used to detect mates and prey, and its other senses perform well. Its brain and central nervous system have been extensively studied for comparison with placental mammals.\nThe short-beaked echidna has the largest prefrontal cortex, relative to body size, of any mammal. It takes up 50% of the volume of the cortex, compared to 29% for humans. This suggests good decision-making in its constant search for insect nests, and for a mate when reproducing.\nBasal traits.\nLike all monotremes, the echidna has only one orifice for the passage of faeces, urine and reproductive products, which is known as the cloaca. The male has internal testes, no external scrotum and a highly unusual penis with four knobs on the tip. The gestating female has a pouch on its underside, where it raises its young.\nThe laying of eggs and the cloaca are basal traits which are present in all early amniotes, including reptiles, birds and early mammals.\nReproduction.\nThe solitary Short-beaked Echidna looks for a mate between May and September; the precise timing of the mating season varies with geographic location. Both males and females give off a strong odour during the mating season. During courtship\u2014observed for the first time in 1989\u2014males locate and pursue females. Trains of up to ten males may follow a single female in a courtship ritual that may last for up to four weeks; the duration of the courtship period varies with location. In cooler parts of their range, such as Tasmania, females may mate within a few hours of arousal from hibernation.\nBefore mating, the male smells the female, paying particular attention to the cloaca. The male is often observed to roll the female onto her side and then assumes a similar position so that the two animals are abdomen to abdomen. Each mating results in the production of a single egg, and females are known to mate only once during the breeding season; each mating is successful.\nFertilisation occurs in the oviduct. Gestation takes between 21 and 28 days, during which time the female constructs a nursery burrow. Following the gestation period, a single rubbery-skinned egg between 13 and 17 millimetres in diameter is laid directly into a small, backward-facing pouch that has developed on her abdomen. Ten days after it is laid, the egg hatches within the pouch. The embryo develops an \"egg tooth\" during incubation, which it uses to tear open the egg; the tooth disappears soon after hatching.\nHatchlings are about 1.5\u00a0cm long and weigh between 0.3 and 0.4 grams. After hatching, young Echidnas are known as \"puggles\". Hatchlings attach themselves to their mothers' milk areolae, a specialised patch on the skin that secretes milk (monotremes have no nipples). The way in which puggles drink the milk is not yet known, but they have been observed drinking large amounts during each feeding period, since mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days. The principal components of the milk are types of lactose. The milk has a high iron content, which gives it a pink colour.\nJuveniles are eventually ejected from the pouch at around two to three months of age, because of the continuing growth in the length of their spines. Suckling gradually decreases until juveniles are weaned at about six months of age. The duration of lactation is about 200 days, and the young leave the burrow between 180 and 240 days.\nThe age of sexual maturity is uncertain, but may be four to five years. A twelve-year field study, published in 2003, found that the Short-beaked Echidna reached sexual maturity between five and 12 years of age, and that the frequency of reproduction varies from once every two years to once every six years. The Short-beaked Echidna can live as long as 45 years in the wild.\nEcology and behaviour.\nNo systematic study of the ecology of the Short-beak Echidna has been published. There have been studies of several aspects of their ecological behaviour. Short-beaked Echidnas live alone and apart from the burrow created for rearing young; they have no fixed shelter or nest site. They do not have a home territory, but range over a wide area. Short-beaked Echidnas are usually active in the daytime; however, they have problems in hot weather, because they have no sweat glands and do not pant. Therefore, in warm weather they change their pattern of activity, becoming crepuscular (active at dawn or dusk) or nocturnal (active in the night). They can tolerate cold temperatures, and hibernate during the winter in very cold regions.\nShort-beaked Echidnas can live anywhere where there is a good supply of food. Short-beaked Echidnas find food by smell, using sensors in the tip of their beak, and regularly feast on ants and termites. They are powerful diggers, using their clawed front paws to dig out prey and dig burrows for shelter. They may rapidly dig themselves into the ground if they cannot find cover when in danger.\nIn Australia they are most common in forested areas where there are many termite-filled fallen logs. In agricultural areas, they are most likely to be in uncleared scrub; they may be in grassland, arid areas, and in the outer suburbs of the capital cities. Little is known about their distribution in New Guinea. They have been found in southern New Guinea between Merauke in the west, to the Kelp Welsh River, east of Port Moresby, where they may be in open woodland.\nConservation status.\nThe Short-beaked Echidna is common in most of temperate Australia and lowland New Guinea, and is not listed as endangered. In Australia, the number of Short-beaked Echidnas has been less affected by land clearing than have some other species, since Short-beaked Echidnas do not require a specialised habitat beyond a good supply of ants and termites. Despite their spines, they are eaten by birds, the Tasmanian Devil, cats, foxes and dogs. They were also eaten by indigenous Australians and the early Europen settlers of Australia. The most common threats to the animal in Australia are cars and habitat destruction. These have led to localised extinction. Infection with the introduced parasite \"Spirometra erinaceieuropaei\" is fatal for the Echidna. The Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland runs an Australia-wide survey called \"Echidna Watch\" to monitor the species in Australia.\nCaptive breeding is difficult, partly because of the relatively infrequent breeding cycle. Only five zoos have managed to breed a captive Short-beaked Echidna, but no captive-bred young have survived to be adults. This has conservation implications for the endangered species of echidna from the genus \"Zaglossus\", and to a lesser extent for the Short-beaked Echidna.\nCultural references.\nShort-beaked Echidnas feature in the animistic culture of Indigenous Australians, including their visual arts and stories. The species was a totem for some groups, including the Noongar people from Western Australia, who called the animal the \"Nyingarn\". Many groups have myths about the animal; one myth explains that it was created when a group of hungry, young men went hunting at night and stumbled across a wombat. They threw spears at the wombat, but lost sight of it in the darkness. The wombat adapted the spears as its own defense and turned into an Echidna. Another story tells of a greedy man that kept food from his tribe; warriors speared him and he crawled away into the bushes, where he was turned into an Echidna, the spears becoming his spines.\nThe Short-beaked Echidna is an iconic animal in modern Australia. It appears on the Australian five-cent piece (the smallest denomination) and on a $200 commemorative coin released in 1992. The Short-beaked Echidna has been included in several postal issues: it was one of four native species to appear on Australian postage stamps in 1974, where it was the 25 cent stamp; it appeared on a 37 cent stamp in 1987, and again in 1992 when it was on the 35 cent stamp. The anthropomorphic Echidna \"Millie\" was a mascot for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Knuckles the Echidna is a popular character from the Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise, debuting in Sonic the Hedgehog 3."}

{"id": "54913", "revid": "103847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54913", "title": "Bioluminescence", "text": "Bioluminescence is the capacity of living things to produce light. Often this is done by symbiosis. In this, the larger organism contains, often in a special organ, microorganisms which make the light. Eukaryote protists have special organelles, and some bacteria also produce light. Bioluminescence is the result of chemical processes, where the energy produced is released as visible light. Bioluminescence has appeared many times during evolution.\nATP (adenosine tri-phosphate), the biological energy source, reacts with luciferin with the aid of the enzyme luciferase to yield an intermediate complex. This complex combines with oxygen to produce a highly chemiluminescent (brightly shining) compound.\nThe role of Gamma Proteobacteria in producing light is discussed in detail in reference works. The capacity to produce light is an extension of normal metabolism: all chemical reactions produce a few photons. Visible light is produced when the photon production increases. In the case of bacteria, the original function of the reaction was probably to detoxify excessive oxygen.\nThe oceans.\nBioluminescence is mainly a marine phenomenon.\nBioluminescence is found in the sea at all levels.: planktonic, pelagic and benthic organisms. Some planktonic groups, such as dinoflagellates and ctenophores (comb jellies) use it in most species. Most deep-sea marine life use bioluminescence in one form or another. Usually, marine light-emission belongs in the blue and green light spectrum, the wavelengths that can transmit through seawater most easily.\nFunctions of bioluminescence.\nFor a list, see Biolum web page.\nCounterillumination camouflage.\nIn some squid species bacterial bioluminescence is used for counterillumination so the animal matches the overhead environmental light seen from below. In these animals, light organs control the contrast of this illumination to create optiminal matching. Usually these light organs are separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria.\nAttraction.\nBioluminescence is used as a lure to attract prey by several deep sea fish such as the anglerfish. A dangling lure on the head of the fish attracts small animals to it within striking distance. Some fish, however, use a non-bioluminescent lure.\nThe cookiecutter shark uses bioluminescence for camouflage, but a small patch on its underbelly remains dark and appears as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When these fish try to consume the \"small fish\", they are bitten by the shark, which gouges out small circular \"cookie cutter\" shaped chunks of flesh from its hosts.\nDinoflagellates have an interesting twist on this mechanism. When a predator of plankton is sensed through motion in the water, the dinoflagellate luminesces. This in turn attracts even larger predators which will consume the would-be predator of the dinoflagellate.\nAttracting mates is an important function of bioluminescence. This is seen in fireflies, which use periodic flashing in their abdomens to attract mates in the mating season. In the marine environment this has only been well-documented in certain small ostracod crustaceans, but may be quite common.\nRepulsion.\nCertain squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescence as many squid use ink. A cloud of luminescence is expelled, confusing or repelling a potential predator while the squid or crustacean escapes to safety. Every species of firefly has larvae that glow to repel predators.\nBiotechnology.\nBioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in the field of genetic engineering. They have also been used in biomedical research, to give some cells visible labels. Luciferin can be added to molecules and cells to make them visible under the microscope. \"This market is now worth about \u00a320bn. If you go into a hospital and have a blood test which measures viral proteins, cancer proteins, hormones, vitamins, bacterial proteins, drugs, it will almost certainly use this technique\".\nThe structure of photophores, the light producing organs in bioluminescent organisms, are being investigated by industrial designers.\nBioluminescent organisms.\nThis is a list of organisms that have visible bioluminescence:\nTerrestrial organisms.\nAnimals:\nFireflies.\nDespite their name, fireflies are actually beetles which use an enzymatic reaction involving a chemical compound called luciferin to produce their typical greenish flashing light. As well as possibly warning predators about their toxicity, it is thought the main purpose of their flashing abdomen is to attract mates."}

This is the type of reaction that is used to break down polymers into many smaller units. In this reaction, water is always added to the chemical compound.\nHydrolysis of metal salts.\nHydrolysis of metal salts is more commonly known as hydration. Many metal ions are strong Lewis acids, and in water they may undergo hydrolysis to form \"basic salts\". Such salts contain a hydroxyl group that is directly bound to the metal ion in place of a water ligand. The positive charge on metal ions creates an attraction to water, a Lewis base with a non-binding electron pair on the oxygen atom, and alters the water molecule's electron density. This in turn increases the polarity of the O-H bond, which now acts as a proton donor under Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory to release the hydrogen as a H+ ion, increasing the acidity of the solution. For example, aluminium chloride undergoes extensive hydrolysis in water with the solution being very acidic.\nThis implies that hydrogen chloride is lost in the evaporation of AlCl3 solutions and the residue is a basic salt (in this case an \"oxychloride\") in place of AlCl3. This type of reaction is also seen with other metal chlorides such as ZnCl2, SnCl2, FeCl3 and lanthanide halides such as DyCl3. With some compounds such as TiCl4, the hydrolysis may go to completion and form the pure hydroxide or oxide, in this case TiO2."}

It is the most abundant molecule on the Earth's surface.\nAt room temperature, it is a nearly colorless, flavorless, and odorless liquid. Many substances dissolve in water and it is commonly seen as \"the universal solvent\"; because of this, water in nature and in use is rarely clean, and may have some properties different than those in the laboratory. But there are many compounds that are essentially, if not completely, insoluble in water. Water is the only common, pure substance found naturally in all three states of matter\u2014for other substances, see Chemical properties.\nPure water is tasteless. It is the other chemicals in the water which may give water a flavour.\nAnomalous properties of water.\nGenerally, the volume of a liquid increases when heated, however the volume of water \"decreases\" when heated within the temperature range of 0\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C. Its volume increases only when heated above 4\u00b0C. Such behavior is one of a number of water's anomalous properties. \nThis property of volume decrease allows fish and other aquatic animals to survive in a body of water when ice has frozen on the surface. In cold climates, when the temperature of a body of water reaches at 4\u00b0C, the layers of water near the top in contact with cold air continue to lose heat energy and their temperature falls below 4\u00b0C. On cooling below 4\u00b0C, these layers rise rather than sink, as water has maximum density at 4\u00b0C. Thus the layer of water with a temperature of 4\u00b0C remains at the bottom, while layers of water 3\u00b0C, 2\u00b0C, 1\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C are formed above. Because ice is poor conductor of heat, it does not allow heat energy transfer from the liquid water beneath the layers of ice, which prevents the liquid water from freezing. Hence, aquatic creatures survive in such places."}

It comes from interstitial fluid in the tissues which is squeezed out of the blood vessels. The lymphatic system transports infection-fighting cells called lymphocytes, and is involved in the removal of foreign matter and cell debris by phagocytes. A second function is to transport fats from the small intestine to the blood. \nLymphatic fluid gathers from the tissues and enters the valved lymphatic ducts. It is the valves which make sure the lymph flows the right way. On its way back to the blood system, the lymph passes through glands called lymph nodes, in places like the back of the neck, the armpits and the groin. Lymph nodes swell in the region of an infected body part. This acts to keep the infection from spreading. It prevents or reduces the pathogens getting into the general blood circulation and reaching other parts of the body.\nLymph ends up back in the blood system. In mammals under normal conditions most of the lymph is returned to the blood stream through lymph-vein communications at the base of the neck. Some vertebrates have more complex lymphatic systems.

It is unlike covalent or ionic bonding. \nMetals have low ionization energy. Therefore, the valence electrons can be delocalized throughout the metals. Delocalized electrons are not associated with a particular nucleus of metal, instead, they are free to move throughout the whole crystalline structure forming a \"sea\" of electrons.\nThe electrons and the positive ions in the metal have a strong attractive force between them. Therefore, metals often have high melting or boiling points. The principle is similar to that of ionic bonds.\nMetallic bonds causes many of the traits of metals, such as strength, malleability, ductility, luster, conduction of heat and electricity.\nBecause the electrons move freely, the metal has some electrical conductivity. It allows the energy to pass quickly through the electrons, generating an electric current. Metals conduct heat for the same reason: the free electrons can transfer the energy at a faster rate than other substances with electrons that are fixed into position. There also are few non-metals that conduct electricity: graphite (because, like metals, it has free electrons), and ionic compounds that are molten or dissolved in water, which have free moving ions.\nMetal bonds have at least one valence electron which they do not share with neighboring atoms, and they do not lose electrons to form ions. Instead, the outer energy levels (atomic orbitals) of the metal atoms overlap. They are similar to covalent bonds. Not all metals exhibit metallic bonding. For example, mercury ions () form covalent metal-metal bonds.\nAn alloy is a solution of metals. Most alloys are shiny like pure metals are."}

For example, we can warm our hands by touching hot-water bottles. When the cold hands touch the hot-water bottle, heat flows from the hotter object (hot-water bottle) to the colder one (hand). People make things with different thermal conductivity, for example cookware to heat things or insulated containers to keep hot things hot or cold things cold.\nOther ways to transfer heat are by thermal radiation and/or convection. Usually more than one of these processes happen at the same time.\nMicroscopic explanation.\nIn the atomic theory solids, liquids and gases are made of tiny particles called \"atoms\". The temperature of the material measures how fast the atoms are moving and the heat measures the total amount of energy due to the vibration of the atoms.\nConduction can happen when one part of a material is heated. The atoms in this part vibrate faster and are more likely to hit their neighbors. The collisions cause those atoms also to move faster, passing the heat energy to them. In this way the energy travels through the solid. (Rather like the way energy passes along a set of tumbling dominos).\nThe atomic picture also helps explain why conduction is more important in solids: in solids the atoms are close together and unable to move around. In liquids and gases the particles can move past each other, so the collisions are less common.\nLaw of heat conduction.\nThe law of heat conduction, also known as Fourier's law, means that the rate, in time, of heat transfer through a material is proportional to the negative gradient in the temperature and to the area at right angles, to that gradient, through which the heat is flowing:\nwhere:\nThermal conductivity usually varies with temperature, but the variation can be small, over a significant range of temperatures, for some common materials."}

Usually the vassal provided soldiers to the lord. The lord used his army of soldiers from all of his vassals to protect those vassals. The lord also gave him the piece of land that he held as a fief. By analogy the term \"vassal\" is used also for similar systems in other feudal societies.\nWestern vassalage.\nThe development of the \"vassal\", in a society that was increasingly organised around the concept of \"lordship\"\u2013 in French the \"seigneur\"\u2013 is one sign that Antiquity ended and the Early Middle Ages began. Lordship is the basic social institution as Tacitus described them in his book \"Germania\". The Roman West experienced them for the first time in the Migration Period.\nAs the system developed in the seventh century, the vassals were gangs of freemen who subjected themselves, in some degree of formality, to the authority of a leader, from whom they could expect to be fed, clothed and armed. The quality of a vassal was only in his fighting ability and the strength of his loyalty. The etymology (where the word came from) of \"vassal\" is from a Celtic word \"gwas\" \"boy\" that meant a young male slave, with a Latinised form, \"vassus\" that appeared in Salic Law (Rouche 1987 p 429), like the way \"knight\" came from the from Old English word \"cniht\" and similar words in Frisian and Dutch, all meaning \"lad\" ."}

They may have been influenced by attacks of the Huns in the East and may also be connected to the Turkic migrations in Central Asia, overpopulation, or climate changes. The migration period also included groups of Angles, Saxons, Frisians, and some Jutes to Britain.\nMigrations would continue well into the Middle Ages, beyond 1000 AD, with successive waves of Slavs, Alans, Avars, Bulgars, Hungarians, Pechenegs, Cumans, and Tatars that changed the ethnic makeup of Eastern Europe.

It includes the cities of San Francisco, San Jos\u00e9, and Oakland, and their many suburbs. It also includes the smaller urban and rural areas of the North Bay. Over seven million people live in the San Francisco Bay Area. The San Francisco Bay Area is the 43rd largest metropolitan area in the world in population.\nThe Bay Area includes cities, towns, military bases, airports, and related regional, state, and national parks.\nSan Jos\u00e9 is the largest city in the Bay Area since 1990 and the tenth largest city in America. But for most of its history, San Francisco was the city with the most people. San Francisco is still the city people pay the most attention to, and it is the major cultural center in the region.\nBay Area Rapid Transit connects the different parts of the Bay Area.\nSubregions.\nNorth Bay.\nThe region north of the Golden Gate Bridge is known locally as the North Bay. This area includes Marin County and continues north into Sonoma and Napa counties and east to Solano County. With some exceptions, this region is quite rich: Marin County is listed as the richest in the nation.\nSan Francisco.\nThe City and County of San Francisco is generally placed in a category by itself in terms of geography and culture. It is separated by water from the north, west and east, and by a county line from its neighbor cities to the South. San Francisco has been the cultural, financial and urban center of the region for a long time. For most of the Bay Area's history, it has also been the main population center. But because the size of the county is limited, the growth of the city was limited as well. As a result, other cities and counties have had more population growth.\nPeninsula.\nThe area between the South Bay and the City and County of San Francisco is the San Francisco Peninsula, known locally as \"The Peninsula\". This area includes many small cities and suburban communities in San Mateo County and the northwestern part of Santa Clara County, as well as several towns along the Pacific coast, such as Pacifica and Half Moon Bay.\nEast Bay.\nThe eastern side of the bay, consisting of Alameda and Contra Costa counties, is known locally as the East Bay. The East Bay is split into two regions, the inner East Bay, which is on the coast of the Bay, and the outer East Bay, including the inland valleys separated from the inner East Bay by hills and mountains.\nSouth Bay.\nThe communities along the southern edge of the Bay are known as the South Bay, Santa Clara Valley, and Silicon Valley. \nThis region is home to a large number of major technology companies. Some tech companies in the South Bay are Intel, AMD, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Google, and Yahoo!, Microsoft and much much more.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is one of the richest regions in the United States."}

There are many trigonometric functions, the 3 most common being sine, cosine, tangent, followed by cotangent, secant and cosecant. The last three are called reciprocal trigonometric functions, because they act as the reciprocals of other functions. Secant and cosecant are rarely used.\nDefinition.\nThe trigonometric functions sometimes are also called circular functions. They are functions of an angle; they are important when studying triangles, among many other applications. Trigonometric functions are commonly defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle, and can equivalently be defined as the lengths of various line segments from a unit circle (a circle with radius of one).\nRight triangle definitions.\nIn order to define the trigonometric functions for the angle \"A\", start with a right triangle that contains the angle \"A\":\nWe use the following names for the sides of the triangle:\nAll triangles are taken to exist in Euclidean geometry, so that the inside angles of each triangle sum to \u03c0 radians (or 180\u00b0); therefore, for a right triangle, the two non-right angles are between zero and \u03c0/2 radians. Notice that strictly speaking, the following definitions only define the trigonometric functions for angles in this range. We extend them to the full set of real arguments by using the unit circle, or by requiring certain symmetries and that they be periodic functions.\n1) The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case\nNote that since all those triangles are similar, this ratio does not depend on the particular right triangle that is chosen, as long as it contains the angle \"A\".\nThe set of zeroes of sine (that is, the values of formula_2 for which formula_3) is\n2) The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case\nThe set of zeroes of cosine is\n3) The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In our case\nThe set of zeroes of tangent is\nThis is the same set as that of the sine function, since\nThe remaining three functions are best defined using the above three functions.\n4) The cosecant csc(\"A\") is the multiplicative inverse of sin(\"A\"); it is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the opposite side:\n5) The secant sec(\"A\") is the multiplicative inverse of cos(\"A\"); it is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent side:\n6) The cotangent cot(\"A\") is the multiplicative inverse of tan(\"A\"); it is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the opposite side:\nDefinitions by power series.\nOne can also define the trigonometric functions by using power series:\nand define tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant using identities, see below.\nIdentities.\nSome important identities:\nHyperbolic functions.\nThe hyperbolic functions are like the trigonometric functions, in that they have very similar properties. Each of six trigonometric functions has a corresponding hyperbolic form. They are defined in terms of the exponential function, which is based on the constant \"e\"."}

It converts a stimulus into a response in the cell. There are two stages in this process:\nSo, signal transduction starts with a signal to a cell receptor, and ends with a change in cell function. In either step, the signal can be amplified. Thus, one signalling molecule can cause many responses.\nReceptors are in the cell membrane, with part of the receptor outside and part inside the cell.\u00a0 The chemical signal binds to the outer portion of the receptor, changing its shape. This causes another signal inside the cell.\u00a0 Some chemical messengers, such as testosterone, can pass through the cell membrane, and bind directly to receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus.\nSometimes there is a cascade of signals within the cell. With each step of the cascade, the signal can be amplified, so a small signal can result in a large response. Eventually, the signal creates a change in the cell, either in the expression of the DNA in the nucleus or in the activity of enzymes in the cytoplasm.\nMost often, ordered sequences of biochemical reactions inside the cell are involved. These are carried out by enzymes and linked through second messengers. So a \"second messenger pathway\" is produced. These things usually happen quickly, sometimes very quickly. They may last from milliseconds (in the case of ion flux) to days for gene expression.\nThe number of proteins and other molecules that take part increases during the process. So a 'signal cascade' develops and \"a relatively small stimulus may cause a large response\".\nIn bacteria and other single-cell organisms, the transduction processes a cell has limits the number of ways it can respond to its environment. In multicellular organisms, lots of different signal transduction processes are used to coordinate the behavior of individual cells. By this means the function of the organism as a whole is organized. The more complex the organism, the more complex the repertoire of signal transduction processes the organism must possess.\nThus, sensing of both the external and internal environment at the cellular level, relies on signal transduction. Many disease processes such as diabetes, heart disease, autoimmunity and cancer arise from defects in signal transduction pathways. This highlights the critical importance of signal transduction to biology and medicine.\nThese systems of communication between cells are extremely ancient, and are found in all metazoa."}

Sea water enters, becomes very hot, and rises. The hottest ones carry many black chemicals, and are called black smokers. Scientists have found fewer white smokers. Heat escapes from underground in many places. If they are on land, they are usually hot springs, geysers, or fumaroles. Many archaea and bacteria live near hydrothermal vents, which are underwater. They support giant tube worms, clams and shrimp, and many other eukaryotes. The earliest known life forms are thought to have lived near such vents.\nBiological communities.\nDeep sea organisms have no access to sunlight, so they must depend on nutrients in the chemical deposits and hydrothermal fluids in which they live. Compared to the surrounding sea floor, however, hydrothermal vent zones have a density of organisms 10,000 to 100,000 times greater.\nHydrothermal vent communities are able to sustain such vast amounts of life because vent organisms depend on chemosynthetic bacteria for food. These bacteria use sulfur compounds, particularly hydrogen sulfide, a chemical highly toxic to most known organisms, to produce organic material through the process of chemosynthesis.\nThe chemosynthetic bacteria grow into a thick mat which attracts other organisms such as amphipods and copepods which graze upon the bacteria directly. Larger organisms such as snails, shrimp, crabs, giant tube worms, fish, and octopus form a food chain of predator and prey relationships above the primary consumers. \nThe main groups of organisms around seafloor vents are worms, gastropods, and crustaceans, with large bivalves, and 'eyeless' shrimp making up the bulk of non-microbial organisms.\nTube worms form an important part of the community around a hydrothermal vent. They absorb nutrients directly into their tissues. There are approximately 285 billion bacteria per ounce of tubeworm tissue.\nTubeworms have red plumes which contain haemoglobin. Haemoglobin combines hydrogen sulfide and transfers it to the bacteria living inside the worm. In return the bacteria nourish the worm with carbon compounds. \nOther examples of the unique fauna who inhabit this ecosystem are the gastropod \"Crysomallon squamiferum\", a species of snail with a foot reinforced by scales made of iron and organic materials, and the 'Pompeii Worm' \"Alvinella pompejana\", which is capable of withstanding temperatures up to 80\u00b0C (176\u00b0F).\nOver 300 new species have been discovered at hydrothermal vents, many of them \"sister species\" to others in geographically separated vent areas. It has been proposed that before the North American plate overrode the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, there was a single biogeographic vent region found in the eastern Pacific. The subsequent barrier to travel began the evolutionary divergence of species in different locations. The examples of convergent evolution seen between distinct hydrothermal vents is seen as major support for the theory of natural selection and evolution as a whole.\nA species of phototrophic bacterium has been found living near a black smoker off the coast of Mexico at a depth of . No sunlight penetrates that far into the waters. Instead, the bacteria, part of the Chlorobiaceae family, use the faint glow from the black smoker for photosynthesis. This is the first organism discovered in nature to exclusively use a light other than sunlight for photosynthesis."}

{"id": "55038", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55038", "title": "Thrust", "text": "Thrust is a force or a push. When a system pushes or accelerates mass in one direction, there is a thrust (force) just as large in the opposite direction. In math and physics, this is described by Isaac Newton\u2019s second and third laws. Thrust is used to describe how strongly an engine pushes. It can be used for many kinds of vehicles and engines such as rockets, motorboats, propellers, and jet engines.\nThrust\u00a0is\u00a0measured\u00a0in \u201cpounds of\u00a0thrust\u201d in the U.S. and in newtons in the metric system. 4.45 newtons of\u00a0thrust\u00a0equals 1 pound of\u00a0thrust. A pound of\u00a0thrust\u00a0is how much\u00a0thrust\u00a0it would take to keep a one-pound object unmoving against the force of gravity on earth.\nThrust compared to power.\nA very common question is how to compare the thrust number of an airplane engine with the mechanical power of a piston engine (the kind of engine in cars and in many airplanes with propellers). It is hard to compare these two. This is because they are not measuring the same exact thing. A piston engine does not move the plane. It just turns the propeller, which moves the plane. Because of this, piston engines are rated by how much power they give to the propeller.\nHowever, a jet engine has no propeller \u2013 it pushes the aircraft by moving hot air behind it. A useful way to measure the power of a jet engine is to how much power the jet engine gives to the aircraft through its thrust force. This is called the \u201cpropulsive power of the jet engine.\" Power is how much force it takes to move something over a distance, divided by the time it takes to move that distance:\nWhere P is power, F is force, d is distance, and t is time. For a rocket or jet engine, the force is the same as thrust produced by the engine. Distance divided by time is also called speed. So power is the same as thrust times speed\nWhere T is thrust and \"v\" is speed. This is the power being delivered by the engine at a certain thrust or velocity. The propulsive power of a jet engine increases with its speed.\nThrust compared to weight.\nWhen the thrust of a rocket or an engine is compared to the weight, it is called the Thrust-to-weight ratio. The number that comes from this comparison does not have any units, because it is a ratio. A ratio in this case means that the thrust of the engine (in Newtons) is divided by the weight (in Newtons). The purpose of this comparison is to show how well the engine or vehicle performs, for example how much acceleration. It is a number that can be used to compare various types of motors like airplane motors, jet engines, rocket engines, or car engines.\nThis comparison number can change while the engine is running. This is because the weight of the engine gets lighter as fuel is used. The thrust-to-weight ratio is used to actually compare engines is the number found when the engine is first running.\nThrust\u00a0is\u00a0measured\u00a0in \u201cpounds of\u00a0thrust\u201d in the U.S. and in Newtons in the metric system. 4.45 Newtons of\u00a0thrust\u00a0equals 1 pound of\u00a0thrust. A pound of\u00a0thrust\u00a0is how much\u00a0thrust\u00a0it would take to keep a one-pound object unmoving against the force of gravity on earth.\nExamples.\nAn airplane makes forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight. The thrust is made by the spinning blades of a propeller. Thrust can also be made by a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine. Another way is by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine.\nReverse thrust is the opposite of forward thrust. In this way air is pushed in the same way as the motion of the body. Reverse thrust can be used to help braking after landing. This can be done by redirecting the thrust in a turbofan or jet engine or by changing the blade angle of a propeller driven aircraft.\nBirds normally achieve thrust during flight by flapping their wings.\nA boat with a motor makes thrust or reverse thrust when the propellers are turned to push water backwards (or forwards). The thrust that this makes pushes the boat in the opposite direction than the water is being pushed.\nA rocket is pushed forward by a thrust force as large as the force the exhaust gas makes when going out of the rocket nozzle. The force the exhaust gas makes is called the exhaust velocity. The velocity is measured compared to the rocket. For vertical launch of a rocket to work, the starting thrust must be more force than the weight of the rocket."}

A fable teaches a lesson or suggests a moral from it. A fable starts in the middle of the story, that means, jumps into the main event without detailed introduction of characters. The characters of a fable may be animals, plants and legendary creatures. When animals are used in fables, they think and talk like people, even though they act like animals. For example, in a fable a clay pot might say that it is frightened of being broken.\nThe stories told by fables are usually very simple. To understand a fable, the reader or listener does not need to know all about the characters, only one important thing. For this reason animals are often used in fables in a way that is easily understood because it is always the same. They keep the same \"characteristics\" from story to story.\nThe most famous fables are those attributed to Aesop (6th century B.C.). Many fables are so well-known that their morals have become English sayings.\nFor example:\n\"Crying wolf\" is another well-known English saying. This comes from \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\". This fable is about a boy who was sent to mind the sheep. The boy got lonely while minding the sheep, so he shouted \"Wolf! Wolf!\" The people came running. The next day, he did it again and they were very angry. On the third day the boy saw a wolf. He cried \"Wolf! Wolf!\" but no one came and the wolf ate him."}

Many agricultural soils need drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest archaeological record of an advanced system of drainage comes from the Indus Valley Civilization from around 3100 BC in what is now Pakistan and North India. The ancient Indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the civilization were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in some areas of modern Pakistan and India today. All houses in the major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had access to water and drainage facilities. Waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets.\nReasons for artificial drainage.\nWetland soils may need drainage to be used for agriculture. In the northern USA and Europe, glaciation created numerous small lakes which gradually filled with humus to make marshes. Some of these were drained using open ditches and trenches.\nThe largest project of this type in the world has been in process for centuries in the Netherlands. The area between Amsterdam, Haarlem and Leiden was, in prehistoric times swampland and small lakes. Turf cutting (Peat mining), subsidence and shoreline erosion gradually caused the formation of one large lake, the Haarlemmermeer, or lake of Haarlem. The invention of wind powered pumping engines in the 15th century permitted drainage of some of the marginal land, but the final drainage of the lake had to await the design of large, steam powered pumps and agreements between regional authorities. The elimination of the lake occurred between 1849 and 1852, creating thousands of km2 of new land."}

It is common in countries like the Netherlands, where much of the country is below sea level and subject to flooding. About one-fifth of the land in the Netherlands has been reclaimed from the sea. Their largest and most successful project is the Zuider Zee project.\nPolders have two distinct features. Firstly, they are enclosed by dikes to keep the water out. The dikes also serve to protect the polder from erosion. Secondly, polders are continually maintained by systems of drainage canals and pumps which prevent them from becoming waterlogged and hence, suitable for cultivation.\nProcess.\nStage 1: Dike constructed around the area to be reclaimed to keep water from coming in.\nStage 2: The area is drained using pumps and drainage canals.\nStage 3: \"Reeds\" (a type of salt tolerant plant) are sown by aircraft to help the soil form.\nStage 4: After 3 years, reeds are burnt and the ash is used as fertilizers for the soil.\nStage 5: After a period of up to 15 years, the polder is ready for growing crops, building houses and constructing roads.\nLimits of land reclamation.\n1.

Resistance is the restriction of current. In a resistor the energy of the electrons that pass through the resistor are changed to heat and/or light. For example, in a light bulb, the tungsten filament acts as a resistor that heats up because of the current going through it, causing it to glow.\nSeries and parallel.\nResistors can be linked in various combinations to help make a circuit:\nThere are many different types of resistors. Resistors have different power ratings to tell engineers how much power they can handle before they break and how accurate their value is. Connecting two resistors in series results in a higher resistance, and connecting them in parallel makes a lower resistance. \nNowadays the electrical industry in many cases uses so called surface-mount technology based resistors which can be very small.\nCalculating resistance.\nWhere R is the resistor's value \nOhm\u2019s Law.\nThe formula for Ohm\u2019s law, V=I*R, states that the voltage drop across a component is equal to the product of the current flowing in the component multiplied by the resistance of the component. When using Ohm\u2019s law, you are able to switch the formula around if needed to find a different outcome: I=V/R or R=V/I \nColor code.\nResistor's values are rated by the colors that are painted on the resistor. The colored bands that are used on the sides of a resistor are black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, gray, and white. Each color represents a different number. The black band represents the number 0, brown band represents the number 1, red is 2 and so on all the way to white which is the number 9. These numbers are very important in the electronic field.\nA resistor has multiple bands of color on its side. The most common have four or five but they can range all the way up to 6 per resistor. On a four band resistor, the last band is usually gold or silver. The gold band represents a positive or negative 5% tolerance. The silver band on a resistor represents a positive or negative 10% tolerance. Hold this band on the right side, and read the colors from left to right. The first two bands are read as the numbers that they represent in the color code. The third band acts as a multiplier for the other bands, so for example, if the third band was an orange band which is a 3, it would mean you multiply the two numbers by 1000. In short you add the value of the color in zeros at the end, so add three zeros.\nOnline calculators are available to calculate color codes. When the color codes are put into the calculator, it will automatically calculate the value of the resistor, along with the tolerance.\nApplications.\nResistors are used in many different ways. First of all, they are put in circuits to protect components from damage such as LEDs.\nThey also control the amount of current flowing in a circuit, for example, if you want less current to flow you would put in a resistor with a higher value. Resistors can also split voltage between different parts of a circuit and control time delay.\nElectric heaters use very large resistors to turn electricity into heat. Usually, engineers try to make resistors heat up as little as possible to not waste power, but in a heater, this \"waste\" is a good thing. You can also use resistors for soldering electronics. \nResistor materials.\nThere are many different types of resistors you can find. They are all made with a resistive material encased in a non-conductive material, such as plastic. Fixed resistors are usually made of carbon encased in a plastic cylinder, with a connecting wire on either end. Most resistors used in electronics today are carbon resistors. Older resistors were made of other poorly conducting metals, in order to restrict the flow of charge."}

Luke obeys and successfully launches the torpedoes into the core. This ultimately resulted in the destruction of the battle station.\n\"Return of the Jedi\" takes place four years later. At this time, the Empire is building a new Death Star. It is half-finished in the movie. Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) send the Rebels false information with the intention of trapping the Rebels, saying that the station's weapons systems are not fully functional.

The WWF has identified 825 terrestrial ecoregions, and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth.\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature's full definition of an ecoregion, which is widely accepted and used, is the following:\nThe \"Global 200\" is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as priorities for conservation.\nTerrestrial.\nA terrestrial ecoregion is a certain area of land which is different from the area near it. It has a distinct climate, geology, type of soil, water availability, and distinct living species (the animals and plants that live in the ecoregion).\nFor example, one ecoregion can be a desert. It would have sand, very little water, very hot temperatures during the day and very cold at night. The plants could be just bushes, small trees, cactii. The animals could be scorpions, little mammals, spiders.\nOr for example, an ecoregion could be a tropical forest It would have warm temperatures all day, a lot of rainfall all year, a huge river crossing, and a very organic soil. The plants could be huge trees or ferns. The animals could be insects, birds, fish and apes.\nMarine.\nMarine ecoregions are regions of the world's oceans, that are defined by the WWF, to help activities for saving marine ecosystems.\nThe scheme used to find out these ecoregions is more or less the same as that for terrestrial ecoregions. Major habitat types are identified: polar, temperate shelfs and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, pelagic, abyssal, and hadal (ocean trench) \u2014 which correspond to the terrestrial biomes. Major biogeographic realms, analogous to the seven terrestrial ecozones, represent large regions of the ocean basins: North Temperate Atlantic, Eastern Tropical Atlantic, Western Tropical Atlantic, South Temperate Atlantic, North Temperate Indo-Pacific, Central Indo-Pacific, Eastern Indo-Pacific, Western Indo-Pacific, South Temperate Indo-Pacific, Southern Ocean, Antarctic, Arctic, and Mediterranean.\nThe classification of Marine ecoregions is not developed to the same level of detail and comprehensiveness as that of the terrestrial ecoregions; only the priority conservation areas of the Global 200 are listed.\nSee Global 200 Marine ecoregions for a full list of marine ecoregions (World Wide Fund for Nature).\nFreshwater.\nFreshwater ecoregions are the freshwater habitats of a particular geographic area, including rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. Freshwater ecoregions are distinct from terrestrial ecoregions, which have biotic communities of the land, and marine ecoregions, which are biotic communities of the oceans.\nThe WWF speaks of seven major habitat types of freshwater ecoregions: Large rivers, large river headwaters, large river deltas, small rivers, large lakes, small lakes, and xeric basins.\nSeveral freshwater ecoregions are listed in the Global 200, the WWF's priority ecoregions for conservation of biodiversity."}

They are shallow. Seas away from continents can be very deep, and do not have continental shelves beneath them. \nSub-zones.\nThe pelagic (or open ocean) zone is divided into a number of sub-zones:\nThe last three zones are similar in character, and some marine biologists count them as a single zone or consider the latter two to be the one zone. Some define the hadopelagic as waters below 6000 meters, whether in a trench or not."}

The human body does not make these chemicals, and must take them from food. Egg yolks and liver are both rich in vitamin A. Many parts of the body need vitamin A. For example, vitamin A helps sight and is good for the immune system. It is also important for a growing embryo.\n\u03b2-carotene, a provitamin found in foods like carrots can be converted to vitamin A. The efficiency of the conversion depends on genetics and fat consumption.\nToo little vitamin A is dangerous to health. People who do not get enough of the vitamin may lose the ability to see in poor light and suffer from a weakened immune system. They may also have problems with memory, because vitamin A is important for the brain. People with malnutrition often have too little vitamin A. This is common in poor countries.\nHypervitaminosis A.\nToo much vitamin A is also dangerous to one's health. It is a condition known as hypervitaminosis. Vitamin A is not soluble in water, and the human body can not get rid of the excess vitamin A easily by urination. Too much vitamin A can make someone very sick. People may get too much vitamin A from taking too many vitamin pills or from eating too much A-rich food like liver.\nWhat applies to humans applies to all mammals at least. Some large predators, such as the big cats, seem not to eat their preys' livers. On the other hand, polar bears apparently do so, and they store vitamin A in their liver cells. However, they have long, sometimes very long, periods between kills. In contrast, African big cats kill about every three or four days, and they do seem to avoid eating the preys' livers."}

It is a steroid which is made in the body under the right conditions. Its making by the body needs sunlight, which acts on the lower layers of the skin. \nHowever, if the body does not make enough, it can be found from food sources in tiny amounts. In fact, many countries add it automatically to certain foods like milk. Supplements can be easily found in most developed countries.\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient. This means that any portion not used immediately is stored in fat tissue for future use.\nWhat it does.\nAs a hormone, Vitamin D does many things in the body. It was first discovered as the substance which could prevent and cure rickets. It controls the levels of calcium ions and phosphates in the blood, as well as calcium and magnesium absorption in the intestines. It helps bones grow and form. It is also good for the immune system.\nDifferent kinds.\nIn total, there are 5 different forms, D1 to D5. The most common ones are D2 and D3 (see images).\nD3 (also called cholecalciferol) is the kind produced by the body. It is also found naturally in marine oils and in lanolin (oil from sheep's wool), the most common source for supplements.\nD2 (also called ergocalciferol) is produced by fungi. It is similar to D3, but not exactly the same.\nGetting enough.\nD3 is made in the skin from cholesterol, and changed into a more active form by the liver. However, the skin will not make it unless enough ultraviolet light shines on it. As sunlight contains ultraviolet light, getting enough sun is one way of getting enough D3.\nMany things can keep the skin from making enough D3. Winter sunlight may be too weak. Melanin, which protects skin from damage, also keeps it from making D3, which is why people with darker skin are more prone to deficiency. Older people are also prone, because aging skin makes less D3, even with enough sunlight. Clothing, glass, sunscreens and sunblocks also shield the skin from getting enough ultraviolet light to make D3.\nIt is hard to know how much supplemental Vitamin D, if any, is needed. Less than 25 micrograms (1000 IU) per day, but up to 100 mcg (4000 IU) per day is considered safe. A recent panel of Vitamin D researchers concluded that \"at least\" 20-25 mcg (800-1000 IU) per day would help most adults.\nFew foods naturally contain much D3. Fish do, especially oily ones, such as salmon, sardine and mackerel. Many kinds of edible mushrooms contain some D2, like shiitake. Mushrooms grown in full sunlight tend to have more."}

Terrestrial biomes with higher net primary productivity, moisture availability, and temperature.\nA fundamental classification of biomes is into:\nBiomes are often given local names. For example, a temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as \"steppe\" in central Asia, \"savanna\" or veld in southern Africa, \"prairie\" in North America, \"pampa\" in South America and \"outback\" or \"scrub\" in Australia.\nSometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection, especially under an individual nation's \"Biodiversity Action Plan\".\nTerrestrial biomes.\nClimate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes. Among the important climatic factors are:\nBiodiversity generally increases away from the poles towards the equator, and increases with humidity.\nThe most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to latitude (or temperature zoning) and humidity.\nUdvardy system.\nIn 1975, Miklos Udvardy published a system of biogeographic provinces that were divided into 12 terrestrial biomes.\nBailey system.\nRobert G. Bailey developed a biogeographical classification system for the United States in a map published in 1975. Bailey subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981, and the world in 1989. The Bailey system is based on climate, and is divided into four domains (Polar, Humid Temperate, Dry, and Humid Tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical, marine and continental, lowland and mountain).\nWWF system.\nA team of biologists developed an ecological land classification system for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) that identified 14 biomes, called major habitat types, and further divided the world's land area into 867 terrestrial ecoregions. This classification is used to define the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the (WWF) as priorities for conservation. The WWF major habitat types are as follows:\nOther biomes.\nThe Endolithic biome, consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock pores and cracks, kilometers beneath the surface, has only recently been discovered and does not fit well into most classification schemes."}

It is found on large landmasses, away from oceans, usually at latitudes from 50\u00b0 to 70\u00b0N. Because there are no large landmasses at such latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, it is only found at high \"altitudes \"(heights) in the Andes and the mountains of Australia and New Zealand's South Island. These climates are in groups \"Dfc\", \"Dwc\", \"Dfd\" and \"Dwd\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification\nThis type of climate has very big changes in temperature throughout the year. In winter, temperatures can drop to -40\u00a0\u00b0C (also -40\u00a0\u00b0F) and in summer, the temperature may go above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F). But the summers are short, as there are no more than three months of the year with an average temperature of at least 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F). However, at least one must have an average temperature of at least 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) . In addition, the coldest month must be below 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) The subarctic climate is in between the humid continental climate and the polar climate. The subarctic climate is found in the these places:\nWith 5\u20137 months in a row where the average temperature is below freezing, all water in the soil and subsoil freezes several feet deep. In the colder parts of this climate, summer warmth is not enough to \"thaw\" (unfreeze) more than a few feet on the top of the soil, so there can be \"permafrost\"(soil that is frozen forever). When the ice melts in the summer, 2 to 14\u00a0ft (0.6 to 4 m) of soil can thaw, depending on the latitude and the type of soil. Some subarctic climates near oceans (such as southern Alaska and the northern edge of Europe), have milder winters and no permafrost, so it is easier to farm there.\nSummer is very short; it has about 45 to 100 days at most, and in a lot of places, the temperatures can go below freezing (32\u00a0\u00b0F or 0\u00a0\u00b0C) at any time of the year, even in the summer. Vegetation (plants) in a subarctic climate usually has low diversity (only a few different types of plants grow), because only \"hardy\" (very tough) species can survive the long winters and make use of the short summers. Trees are mostly evergreen conifers, because few \"broadleaved\" (big leaves) trees can survive the very low temperatures in winter. This type of forest is also known as taiga. The word \"taiga\" can also be a name for the climate itself. A lot of plants grow in the taiga (even if there are only a few different kinds of plants), so the taiga (boreal) forest is the largest forest biome on the planet, with most of the forests in Russia and Canada.\nIs it usually very hard to farm in subarctic climates, because the soil is \"infertile\" (it doesn't have the nutrients that many plants need to grow) and because of the many swamps and lakes that ice sheets make, and only very tough crops can survive the short growing seasons. On the plus side, the days last longer in the summer as you get closer to the poles. So the plants that can grow get a lot of sunlight. Potatoes, strawberries, blueberries and hay for animals grow well. Special varieties of other plants may grow as well.\nThere is very little precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail); no more than 15 to 20 inches over an entire year. Rain and snow may stay above ground until the ground melts. This means that when the precipitation does soak into the ground, it can be very wet and muddy.\nClose to the Earth's poles and the water around the poles, the warmest month has an average temperature of less than 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F), and the subarctic climate turns into a tundra climate, which is even worse for trees.\nHere are some places with subarctic climates:\nSome places in the climate group \"Dfd\" (a very, very cold subarctic climate) are:"}

He is one of the greatest and most original composers of the 20th century. His work was published for the first time when he was 30 years old, and only become famous when he was about 40. The rhythms in his music and the tonality are very original. He is remembered for many kinds of music: opera, oratorio, orchestral music, chamber music and piano music. His oratorio \"A Child of our Time\" is especially well-known and often performed by choirs.\nHis life.\nTippett was born in Eastcote, Middlesex and spent his childhood in a small village in Suffolk. His father had retired and had bought a hotel in Cannes, France. Michael and his brother learned to speak French when they were very young. He was sent to school in Edinburgh when he was 13 but did not like it there so he went to the local Stamford Grammar School in Lincolnshire.\nThe only musical training he had as a child were his piano lessons. When he had finished his school years he decided he wanted to be a composer, but neither he nor his parents knew the best way to become a composer. He started having more piano lessons. Then someone said he should go to the Royal College of Music. He went there at the beginning of the summer term, 1923 and spent five years there studying music. He then moved to Oxted in Surrey and for six years he taught French at a school. He composed in his free time.\nIn Oxted there was a small choir. Tippett had sung with them while he was a student. Now he became their conductor and he learned a lot about music by getting the choir to sing English madrigals and other music including operatic music. He took some more lessons in composition from R.O.Morris at the RCM. He went to music camps where he learned more ideas about politics than about music. He agreed with a lot of the ideas of Trotsky. He became a pacifist and in 1940 he registered as a conscientious objector. In 1943 he spent three months in prison because he refused to help with the war effort.\nMeanwhile, Tippett had become director of music at Morley College. He made the choir there into one of the best choirs in England. He played a lot of music by Henry Purcell whose music was not as well known then as it is now. He also worked with young musicians who later became famous: the tenor Peter Pears, the countertenor Alfred Deller and the Amadeus String Quartet.\nIn 1951 he became a broadcaster with the BBC. Some of the talks he gave on the radio were published in his book \"Moving into Aquarius\". He continued a brilliant career as composer, conductor and broadcaster. He was director of the Bath Festival which he helped to improve a lot. He became internationally famous, especially in America. His \"Symphony no 4\" and his oratorio \"Mask of Time\" were written for performances in America. His last opera \"New Year\" was written jointly for the Houston Grand Opera, Glyndebourne and the BBC. He was made a CBE in 1959, knighted in 1966, made a Companion of Honour in 1979 and received an Order of Merit in 1983. He received many honours from universities.\nTippett died from pneumonia in London in 1998 after travelling to Stockholm for a festival which included all his works except his stage works. Although he was able to return home he died shortly afterwards.\nHis music.\nIt is unusual for a great musician to begin studying music properly at the age of 18. However, he was old enough to realize that he had a lot to learn. He studied counterpoint and was influenced by the way Classical composers had shaped their music. Beethoven especially was an inspiration for him. One of his best-known works is the \"Concerto for Double String Orchestra\" (1938-1939). It shows his love of folk music as well as interest in English music of the Renaissance. This music is exciting because of its beats, which keep changing, and its dance-like character.\n\"A Child of Our Time\" was an oratorio which used negro spirituals. He combined these with his own style of music. It is about something that really happened in 1938. A 17-year-old Jewish Polish boy killed a Nazi diplomat because the Nazis had taken away his parents. The Nazis were angry and killed lots of Jews in return. It was something which helped to lead to the World War II. Tippett\u2019s music is about the cruelty that humans show towards one another.\nTippett\u2019s operas include \"A Midsummer Marriage\" (started 1946, first performed 1955), \"King Priam\" (1958-61), \"The Knot Garden\" (1966-69) and \"The Ice Break\" (1973-76) and \"New Year\" (1989). He wrote several choral works. His orchestral works include 4 symphonies, a \"Fantasia concertante on a Theme of Corelli\" for strings (1953), a \"Piano Concerto\" (1953-55) and a \"Concerto for violin, viola and cello\" (1979). His chamber music includes piano sonatas and string quartets.\nHis writings.\nTippett published many of his writings. \"Moving into Aquarius\" consists of talks given on the BBC. In his autobiography \"Those Twentieth Century Blues\" he discusses many of his problems, including his homosexuality, which in his earlier years he could not talk about because it was illegal at that time."}

It is found at the end of a toe or finger in many mammals, birds, and some reptiles. The word \"claw\" is also used in reference to an invertebrate. For example, the chelae of crabs and lobsters are often called claws or pincers. \nA claw is made of hard protein called keratin. They are used by some meat eating mammals such as cats to catch and hold prey, but they may also be used for other things such as digging, climbing trees, and so on, in those and other species.\nSimilar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead.\nArthropods.\nThe correct name for an arthropod's 'claw' is chela (plural \"chelae\"). Legs that have a chela are called chelipeds. Chelae are also called pincers.\nTetrapods.\nIn tetrapods, claws are made of keratin and have two layers. The unguis is the outside hard layer, which has keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an angle. The subunguis is the soft, flaky layer, and the grain is parallel to the direction of growth. The claw grows outward from the nail matrix at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while traveling across the nail bed. The unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to make a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle, making a more or less sharp point. Tetrapods use their claws in many ways, such as grasping or killing prey, digging, climbing, and hanging.\nBirds.\nA talon is the claw of a bird of prey, which it uses to hunt. The talons are very important, and if they did not have them, those birds would not be able to catch their food.\nMammals.\nA nail is similar to a claw but it is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point. A nail that is big enough to hold weight is called a 'hoof'. \nEvery so often, the growth of claws stops and restarts, just like the growth of hair. In hair, this causes the hair to fall out and it is replaced by a new one. In claws, this results in an old layer, and it breaks off. This takes several months for human thumbnails. Cats are often seen working old layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose. Ungulates' hooves trim themselves when they walk on the ground. Domesticated equids (horses, donkeys and mules) usually need regular trimming by a farrier.\nMany predatory mammals have claws that can hide inside the animal's paw, especially animals such as the cat.\nPrimates.\nA primate's nail only has the unguis; the subunguis has disappeared. Similar to the tail, the claw in apes is not needed. However, in some primates, the subunguis has redeveloped to make a claw-like structure. These certain animals do not have actual claws; instead the unguis appears normal along with a thick growth of subunguis. Some lemurs have a toilet-claw."}

The hens each try to swallow a piece of bread, which sticks in their throats and they end up hanging in the tree and die.\nIn the second story Widow Bolte, who is still crying, decides she might as well roast the hens. The boys take fishing rods, climb onto the roof and pull the frying chickens up with their rods. Widow Bolte finds the chickens gone, thinks her little dog has eaten them, and gives the poor dog a beating.\nIn the third story they take a saw and make a hole in the tiny wooden bridge outside the tailor\u2019s house. They shout at the tailor, calling him names. He is furious and comes running out, the bridge breaks and he falls into the stream. Two flying geese save him. He has a terrible tummy ache but his wife puts a hot iron on his tummy and he feels better.\nIn the fourth story the boys put gunpowder in the pipe of the schoolmaster while he is in church. When he lights his pipe there is an explosion.\nIn the fifth story the boys collect beetles and put them under the mattress in their uncle\u2019s bed. In the middle of the night, when the uncle is asleep, the beetles creep up on him. He wakes up and fights with them until he has killed them all.\nIn the sixth story the boys try to steal some pretzels (German rolls) from the bakery, but they fall into the tub of dough. The baker comes in and finds them. He bakes them in the oven, but when they are taken out they eat their way through the dough and escape.\nIn the seventh story the boys cut a hole in the farmer\u2019s sacks. When the miller picks one of these sacks up he realizes the grain is spilling. He sees the boys, puts them in the sack and takes them to the mill, where the miller grinds them into corn and feeds them to his ducks."}

A common reason is because of the person's religious or philosophical beliefs. When done for religious reasons, it is called celibacy. Other people may choose abstinence in order to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. When someone is abstinent from sex but they don't want to be, its sometimes called \"incel\", short for \"involuntary celibacy\"."}

Paul of Tarsus in Galatians 2:9 (KJV) characterized James as such: \"... James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars...\" He is described in the New Testament as a \"brother of Jesus\" and in the Liturgy of St James as \"the brother of God\" (\"Adelphotheos\") \nName.\nJames was called \"the Just\" because of his ascetic practices, which involved taking Nazarite vows. The name also helps distinguish him from other important figures in early Christianity, such as James, son of Zebedee.\nHe is sometimes called \"James Adelphotheos\", (literally \"James the Brother of God\" - Greek : I\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf \u0391\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 ), based on New Testament descriptions.\nJames' name was important in the genealogy of Jesus because he always appears first when someone lists Jesus' brothers and sisters, this means that James was the eldest brother of Jesus.\nLife.\nThe canonical writings of the New Testament, as well as other written sources from the early church, provide some insights into Saint James' life and his role in the early church. The Synoptics mention his name, but nothing else about him, whereas the Gospel of John and early chapters of the Acts of the Apostles do not even mention James.\n\"Acts of the Apostles\", in later chapters, provides evidence that James was an important figure in the Christian community of Jerusalem. When Peter, having miraculously escaped from prison, must flee Jerusalem, he asks that James be informed (12:17). When the Christians of Antioch are concerned over whether Gentile Christians need be circumcised to be saved, and they send Paul and Barnabas to confer with the Jerusalem church there, James played a prominent role in the formulation of the council's decision (15:13ff). Indeed, after Peter and Paul have made their case, it is James who finally delivers what he calls his \"judgement\"\u2014the original sense is close to \"my ruling\"\u2014and afterwards, all accept it. James, in other words, is shown in charge of the Jerusalem group, which conflicts with later claims of Peter's primacy there. And when Paul arrives in Jerusalem to deliver the money he raised for the faithful there, it is to James that he speaks, and who insists that Paul ritually cleanse himself at Herod's Temple to prove his faith and deny rumors of teaching rebellion against the Torah (21:18ff) (a charge of antinomianism).\nPaul further describes James as being one of the persons the risen Christ showed himself to (1 Corinthians 15:3-8); then later in 1 Corinthians, mentions James in a way that suggests James had been married (9:5); and in Galatians, Paul lists James with Cephas (better known as Peter) and John, as the three \"pillars\" of the Church, and who will minister to the \"circumcised\" (in general Jews and Jewish Proselytes) in Jerusalem, while Paul and his fellows will minister to the \"uncircumcised\" (in general Gentiles). (2:9, 2:12). These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean Jews and Greeks, who were predominant, however it is an oversimplification as 1st century Iudaea Province also had some Jews who no longer circumcised, and some Greeks (called Proselytes or Judaizers) and others such as Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Arabs who did."}

In the Book of Acts, the Apostles themselves have disciples. The word \"disciple\" is used today as a way of self-identification for those who seek to learn from Christianity.\nThe term disciple comes from the Ancient Greek language word\ncoming to English by way of the Latin \"discipulus\". \"Disciple\" should not be confused with \"apostle\", meaning\n\"\" While a disciple is one who learns from a teacher, a student, an apostle is sent to deliver those teachings to others.\nDisciples of Jesus of Nazareth.\nThe four.\nBoth the gospels of Mark () and Matthew () include passages where Jesus initially calls four fishermen from among those at the Sea of Galilee. These are Simon (later called \"Rock\" or Peter) and his brother Andrew, and the brothers James and John (later called the \"Sons of Thunder\" or Boanerges). A very similar report in the Gospel of Luke does not speak of Andrew. also includes an initial calling of disciples, but these are: an unnamed disciple, Andrew, Simon, Philip and Nathanael.\nSince the Gospel of Luke does not include Andrew, and through various passages in the four gospels where Simon Peter, James and John are called to meet with Jesus separately from the twelve, they are commonly termed \"the three.\" The usage of \"the four\" over \"the three\" is still a point which some Christians debate, but never as an essential doctrinal point.\nThe twelve.\nMost of the attention in the gospels is given to a specific group of disciples called by Jesus on the top of a mountain and commissioned by him as the Twelve Apostles. These men are:\nThe Gospel of John refers to one disciple as the one whom Jesus loved. Since the apostle John, unlike the other twelve, is never named in that gospel, the \"beloved disciple\" is assumed to be him.\nGreat crowd and the seventy.\nThe number of or persons among Jesus' disciples is not always given in the gospel accounts. A much larger group of people is identified as disciples in the opening of the passage of the Sermon on the Plain that begins in Luke .\nAdditionally, seventy (or seventy-two, depending on the source used) people are sent out in pairs to prepare the way for Jesus (Luke 10). They are sometimes referred to as \"the Seventy\" or \"the Seventy Disciples\". They are to eat any food offered, heal the sick and spread the word; that God's reign is coming, that whoever hears them hears Jesus, whoever rejects them rejects Jesus and whoever rejects Jesus rejects the One who sent him. In addition they are granted great powers over the enemy and their names are written in heaven.\nRoad to Emmaus.\nCleopas is one of the two disciples to whom the risen Lord appeared at Emmaus (Luke 24:18). Cleopas, with an unnamed disciple of Jesus' are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection. Cleopas and his friend were discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asked them what they spoke of. The stranger asked to join Cleopas and his friend for the evening meal. There the stranger revealed himself, after blessing and breaking the bread, as the resurrected Jesus and then disappeared. Cleopas and his friend hastened to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, where Jesus subsequently appeared to them as well. The incident is without parallel in Matthew, Mark, or John.\nWomen.\nIn Luke (10:38\u201342), Mary, sister of Lazarus is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was \"cumbered about many things\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the better part,\" that of listening to the master's discourse. John names her as the \"one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair\" (11:2). In Luke, an unidentified \"sinner\" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet. Any pre-existing relationship between Jesus and Lazarus himself, prior to the miracle, is unspecified by John. In Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, is seen as the same as Mary Madgalene.\nLuke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve. From among them he names three women: \"Mary, called Magdalene, ... and Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources\" (Luke 8:2-3). Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the \"two men in dazzling clothes\". Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve. More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers. There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.\nOther gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection. Mark includes Mary, the mother of James and Salome (not to be confused with Salom\u00e9 the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb. John includes Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion."}

Topkap\u0131 Saray\u0131 in Turkish means the \"Cannongate Palace\". It was built in 1465. The palace was the administrative center of the Ottoman Empire. It was turned into a museum at the request of Turkey's first President, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in 1924. It was built on the acropolis, the site of the first settlement in Istanbul. The palace has an very good view of the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. The palace is surrounded by 5km of walls. It has an area of 700,000 sq. m at the tip of the historical peninsula.\nFirst Court.\nThe First Court (or \"Alay Meydan\u0131\") spans over the entire Seraglio Point and is surrounded by high walls. This court was also known as the Court of the Janissaries or the Parade Court.\nThe main gate is called Bab-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun, simply the Imperial Gate. Apart from the Topkap\u0131 Palace, the First Court also contains the old imperial mint (constructed in 1727), the church of Hagia Eirene, the Archeology Museum (constructed during the 19th century) and various fountains, pavilions (for example, the \u00c7inili Pavilion, or Tiled Pavilion) and gardens (including the G\u00fclhane Park, the old imperial rose garden). \nThe \u00c7inili Pavilion (1472) has many superb examples of Iznik tiles. It now houses the Museum of Islamic Art.\nThe Fountain of the Executioner is where the executioner washed his hands and sword after a beheading. The Fountain of Ahmed III is an example of Rococo work. \nThe huge Gate of Greeting (\"Bab-\u00fcs Selam\") leads into the palace and the Second Court (\"Divan Meydan\u0131\").\nSecond Court.\nThe second court is a park surrounded by the palace hospital, bakery, Janissary quarters, stables, the imperial Harem and Divan to the north and the kitchens to the south. The kitchens today contain one of the world's largest collections of Chinese blue-and-white and celadon porcelain, valued by the sultans because it was supposed to change color if the food or drink it contained was poisoned. \nThe Divan Salonu, or Imperial Council Chamber, was where the sultan's counselors and functionaries met to discuss the empire's affairs. The Sultan could overhear from a concealed grille.\nThird Court.\nBeyond the Gate of Felicity (\"Bab-\u00fcs Saadet\") is the Third Court which is the heart of the palace, a lush garden surrounded by the Hall of the Privy Chamber (\"Has Oda\") occupied by the palace officials, the treasury (which contains some of the finest treasures of the Ottoman age, including the Sacred Trusts), the Harem and some pavilions, with the library of Ahmed III in the center. \nThe Treasury holds some of the most famous and spectacular jewels in the world, including the famous Topkap\u0131 Dagger. In 1747, the Sultan had this dagger made for Nadir Shah of Persia, but the Shah was assassinated before the emissary had left the Ottoman Empire's boundaries and so the Sultan retained it. There are three large emeralds in the hilt and the sheath is worked with diamonds and enamel. This dagger was the subject of the famous film \"Topkapi\". \nThe Harem was home to the Sultan's mother, the Valide sultan; the concubines and wives of the Sultan; and the rest of his family, including children; and their servants. There are approximately 300 rooms (though only about twenty are open to the public), and the Harem housed as many as 500 people, which sometimes amounted up to 300 women, their children, and the eunuchs. \nMany of the rooms and features in the Harem were designed by Sinan, a famous architect of the Ottoman Empire. \nThe Pavilion of the Holy Mantle holds the cloak of Mohammed, his sword, his teeth, his beard, and other relics which are known as the Sacred Trusts. Even the Sultan and his family were permitted entrance only once a year, on the 15th day of Ramadan, during the time when the Palace was a residence. Now any visitor can see these items and many Muslims come on pilgrimage for this purpose."}

It is also influenced by early British rock bands (such as The Rolling Stones and The Who), football chants, pub rock and glam rock bands. The music is often very simple, and the lyrics are blunt (brutally honest, without tact).\nPunk rock began to become popular in the 1970s. Some perceived that it was becoming more and more commercialised. This was the kind of thing that punks were against. Oi! began partly as a response to this perception. It was also partly a response to stereotyping that others made about punks. One stereotype was that many people in the early punk rock scene were young people using big words and trying to be artistic, but failing.\nEarly Oi! bands such as Sham 69 were around for years before the word \"Oi!\" was used to describe their style of music. The word was first used as a name for the new genre in 1980, by journalist Garry Bushell. He took the name from the way the Cockney Rejects used \"Oi!\" during live shows to introduce their songs. \"Oi! Oi! Oi!\" was the title of the third track on their second album. The word is an old Cockney expression, meaning \"hey\" or \"hello\". Other bands that were labelled as Oi! bands in the early days of the genre included Angelic Upstarts, The 4-Skins, The Business, Blitz, The Blood, and Combat 84. More recent punk bands such as Rancid and Dropkick Murphys have credited Oi! as a source of inspiration."}

The colonies usually have a skeleton of calcium carbonate. Bryozoans have a long fossil history, starting in the Ordovician. In their life-style they resemble the polyps which form coral. They generally like warm, tropical waters but live all over the world. There are about 5,000 living species, and 15,000 fossil species are known. \nThe colonies are formed by tiny (~0.2mm) members called zooids. They secrete tubes, usually of lime (CaCO3), sometimes of chitin, an organic compound. The zooids in a colony are all clones, produced by asexual reproduction. Despite this, most species produce different morphs: zooids with different functions. \nAll bryozoa have a lophophore. This is a ring of ten tentacles surrounding the mouth, each tentacle covered with cilia. When feeding, the zooid extends the lophophore outwards; when resting it is withdrawn into the mouth to protect it from predators.\nAnatomy &amp; physiology.\nBryozoan skeletons grow in a variety of shapes and patterns: mound-shaped, lacy fans, branching twigs, and even corkscrew-shaped. Their skeletons have many tiny openings. Each opening is the home of \"zooid\". They have a body with a U-shaped gut, opening at the mouth and at the anus. They feed with their lophophore. The tentacles of the bryozoans are ciliated. The beating of the cilia creates a current of water which drives food (mainly phytoplankton) towards the mouth. In some groups, notably some ctenostomes, a gizzard may be formed. \nBryozoans do not have a respiratory, or a blood system, because their small size allows diffusion of gases and nutrients. However, they do have a simple nervous system, and muscles, which together can quickly take the zooid down into its shelter.\nOne species of bryozoan, \"Bugula neritina\", is of interest as a source of chemicals, bryostatins, which are under investigation as anti-cancer agents.\nReproduction &amp; development.\nBryozoans can reproduce both sexually and asexually. All Bryozoans, as far as is known, are hermaphrodite (meaning they are both male and female).\nAll members of a colony are clones: they are genetically identical, produced by asexual reproduction. This occurs by budding off new zooids from the first zooid. So the colony grows; this is the way a colony expands in size. If a piece of a bryozoan colony breaks off, the piece can continue to grow and will form a new colony.\nAll zooids in a colony are linked by strands of epithelial cells. The individual members of a colony, the zooids, are in some species generalised: they feed, and they can reproduce on occasion. But in most species the zooids are specialised to diffent functions. In this case the feeding zooids are called \"autozooids\", and the non-feeding members are called \"heterozooids\". Functions done by heterozooids include sexual reproduction, protection, locomotion, plumbing, structural support. The functions of some heterozooids is still unknown. The commonest function is that eggs are developed in brooding chambers (\"ovicells\") on female or hermaphrodite heterozooids. There are variations in the details: sometimes a little complex of heterozooids produce larvae in a cooperative effort.p4\nAnother way to describe the bryozoa which develop heterozooids is to say they are polymorphic. This term is used in biology to describe the way a genetically unified population develops into clearly distinct forms. The polymorphism is usually controlled by genetic switching mechanisms, but in bryozoa there is little knowledge of their genetics.\nEcology.\nMost species of Bryozoan live in marine environments. There are about 50 species which inhabit freshwater. In their aquatic habitats, bryozoans live on all types of hard substrates: sand grains, rocks, shells, wood, blades of kelp, pipes and ships may be heavily encrusted with bryozoans. Some bryozoan colonies, however, do not grow on solid substrates, but form colonies on sediment. While some species live at depths of 8,200\u00a0m, most bryozoans live in much shallower water. Most bryozoans are sessile and immobile, but a few colonies are able to creep about, and a few species of non-colonial bryozoans live and move about in the spaces between sand grains. One remarkable species makes its living while floating in the Southern Ocean. Several bryozoan species live in the Midwestern United States, especially in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky which was once a part of a large ocean, the Western Interior Seaway.\nTheir diet consists of small microorganisms, including diatoms and other unicellular algae. In turn, bryozoans are preyed on by grazing organisms such as sea urchins and fish. \nBryozoans are almost entirely colony-forming animals. Many millions of individuals can form one colony. The colonies range from millimeters to meters in size, but the individuals that make up the colonies are tiny, usually less than a millimeter long. In each colony, different individuals have different functions. Some individuals gather up the food for the colony (autozooids), others depend on them (heterozooids). Some individuals are devoted to strengthening the colony (kenozooids), and still others to cleaning the colony (vibracula). There is only a single known solitary species, \"Monobryozoon ambulans\", which does not form colonies.\nFossils.\nFossil bryozoans first appear in the early Ordovician and had a huge adaptive radiation. They were abundant throughout the Palaeozoic era: they were one of the most dominant groups of Palaeozoic fossils. They were major components of seabed communities and, like modern-day bryozoans, played an important role in sediment stabilization and binding. They were food sources for many other benthic organisms. During the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian) 354 to 323 million years ago, bryozoans were so common that their broken skeletons form entire limestone beds. \nAfter a crash at the Permian/Triassic boundary, when almost all species went extinct, bryozoans recovered in the later Mesozoic to become as successful as before. The bryozoan fossil record has more than 15,000 species. \nMost fossil bryozoans have mineralized skeletons. The skeletons of individual zooids vary from tubular to box-shaped and contain a terminal aperture from which the lophophore is protruded to feed. No pores are present in the great majority of Ordovician bryozoans, but skeletal evidence shows that epithelia were continuous from one zooid to the next.\nOne of the most important events during bryozoan evolution was the acquisition of a calcareous skeleton and the mechanism of tentacle protrusion. The rigidity of the outer body walls gave protection against predators, a greater degree of zooid connection, and the evolution of massive colony forms."}

The motive usually is that if a person \"believes\" that a medicine, diet, or other treatment is good for them, then it \"is\" good for them.\nSometimes sick people who receive a placebo feel like they are getting better, and sometimes their bodies actually do get better. When patients have that response, it is called the \"placebo effect\". The term \"placebo effect\" (or \"placebo response\") was introduced in 1920. It is the response of the subject which causes the observed effect, not the substance.\nOrigins.\nJohn Haygarth tested a placebo effect in the 18th century. It showed \"to a degree which has never been suspected, what powerful influence upon diseases is produced by mere imagination\".\n\u00c9mile Cou\u00e9, a French apothecary, working between 1882 and 1910, discovered what later came to be known as the \"Placebo effect\". He reassured his clients by praising each remedy's efficiency and leaving a small positive notice with each medication. In 1901 Cou\u00e9 began to study under hypnosis. In 1913, Cou\u00e9 and his wife founded \"La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lorraine de Psychologie appliqu\u00e9e\". His book \"Self-mastery through conscious autosuggestion\" was published in England (1920) and in the United States (1922).\nPlacebos and blind trial.\nPlacebos are used as part of blind trials. Blind trials work like this: Some people are given the medicine or treatment being tested, and others are given the placebo. No one knows who gets the real treatment and who gets the placebo. They are \"blind\" to their treatment.\nIf researchers notice that the \"treatment group\" is different from the \"placebo group\" they will know that the difference is because of the treatment. Without a \"placebo group\" then researchers cannot know if those changes would have happened anyway, no matter which medicine people had taken.\nGenuine effects of placebos.\nPlacebos can have real effects on patients: that is what \"placebo effect\" means. Since a landmark paper in 1955 the placebo effect has been recognised and accepted by some, and denied by others. However, there is no doubt that for certain conditions, the placebo effect does exist. Examples are:"}

That is, they have the same (mathematical) value and the same mathematical properties. Mathematicians use the equals sign (=) to say this. This defines a binary relation, equality. The statement \"\"x\" = \"y\"\" means that \"x\" and \"y\" are equal.\nEquivalence in a more general sense is provided by the construction of an equivalence relation between two mathematical objects, that is, two mathematical objects are equivalent if they are related by this relation. In which case, the equivalence is often represented using the symbols formula_1 or formula_2.\nA statement that two expressions denote equal quantities is an equation (or an equality). Equations are equal. Inequalities are unequal.\nAn equality is also a transitive relation. This means that if one object is equal to a second object, and the second object is equal to a third object, then the first object is equal to the third object as well.\nSince a predicate is a way of describing something that is true, another way to say this is that if one thing that is true about a variable is not true about the other variable, then they are not \"equal\" as far as mathematical logic is concerned: two things are only equal if anything that is true about one has to be true about the other.\nIn geometry, the word congruence is often preferred. Numbers are equal, geometrical objects are congruent. Two shapes are congruent if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is. If shrinking or enlarging one of the two objects is needed, then they are not congruent. They are called \"similar\" instead. The congruence relation is often represented by the symbol formula_3, while the similarity relation is represented by the symbol formula_1.\nIn computer science, usually, the mathematical definition is used. Very often, the comparison is written \"==\" (and the assignment, the act of giving a value, is written as \"=\", or \":=\"). In object-oriented languages, or languages which have pointers, there is an additional problem. Those languages contain references (which are in fact pointers). If two such references do not reference exactly the same object, then they are different and \"a == b\" will be false in this case.\nFor this reason, many such languages have introduced another operator (in Java, this method is called \"equals\"). This operator compares the actual values of the objects\u2014not where the variables that reference them point to.\nIn social sciences, two people are equal if many of the same things are true about them. For example. two people who have the same amount of education and money, and who are of the same age usually think of each other as equals. Another name for a person who is equal to another person is a peer."}

Galerius married Diocletian's daughter Valeria, and took over the Illyrian provinces.\nWar with Persia.\nDefeat.\nIn 296, at the beginning of the Persian War, Galerius moved from the Danube to the Euphrates. There his first campaign ended in a defeat by the Sassanid prince Narses, near Callinicum. This disaster caused the loss of Mesopotamia.\nDiocletian came to Antioch, where the official version of events was made clear: Galerius was to take the blame. In Antioch, Diocletian forced Galerius to walk a mile in advance of his imperial cart while still clad in the purple robes of an emperor.p17p292/3 The message was clear: the loss at Carrhae was not due to the failings of the empire's soldiers, but due to the failings of their commander, and Galerius' failures would not be accepted.\nVictory.\nIn 298 Galerius got reinforcements from the Danube in the Spring. He led the army to attack Narseh in northern Mesopotamia, and Narseh retreated to Armenia.\nThe rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry, but unfavorable to Sassanid cavalry. Local aid gave Galerius the advantage of surprise over the Persian forces. In two battles, Galerius got victories over Narseh.p18p293\nDuring the second encounter, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife.p18 Narseh's wife would live out the remainder of the war in Daphne, a suburb of Antioch. This was, to the Persians, a constant reminder of Roman victory.p293 Galerius advanced into Media and Adiabene, winning victories.p151 He took Nisibis (Nusaybin, Turkey) before 1 October 298. He moved down the Tigris, taking Ctesiphon, and looking at the ruins of Babylon. Then he returned to Roman territory by the Euphrates.\nNarses asked for peace. Mesopotamia was returned to Roman rule and even some territory east of the Tigris. This was the greatest extension of the Roman Empire in the east.\nLast years.\nIn 305, on the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian, Galerius got the title of Augustus, together with Constantius, his former colleague. Two younger men were appointed as Caesars: Maximus Daia and Severus II.\nGalerius' hopes were dashed when his colleague Constantius died at York in 306. The legions raised his son Constantine to the position of Augustus. Galerius only discovered this when he got a letter from Constantine, who told him of his father's death, modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession, and respectfully lamented that the enthusiasm of his troops had not allowed him to get the Imperial purple in a regular manner.\nThe first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise, disappointment, and rage. As he could not restrain his passions, he threatened to burn both the letter and the messenger.p28/9p6279\u201380p160\nWhen he had time to reconsider his position, he realised his chances of winning a war against Constantine was doubtful. Therefore, without commenting on the choice of the British army, Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the ruler of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave him only the title of Caesar, and the fourth rank among the Roman princes, whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favourite, Severus II.\nSuddenly Galerius had the unexpected loss of Italy to Maxentius, his son-in-law. Galerius\u2019 need for revenue led him to make a strict examination of the property of his subjects for the purpose of taxation. A survey was taken of their estates. Where there was the slightest suspicion of concealment, torture was used to get a sincere declaration of their personal wealth.\nItaly had traditionally been exempt from any form of taxation, but Galerius ignored this. Italy began to murmur against this indignity and Maxentius used this sentiment to declare himself emperor in Italy, to the fury of Galerius. Therefore, Galerius ordered his colleague Severus to immediately march to Rome, so that, by his unexpected arrival, he would easily suppress the rebellion. Severus was quickly captured and executed by Maximian, who had once again been elevated to the rank of co-emperor, this time by his son Maxentius.\nThe importance of the occasion needed the presence and abilities of Galerius. At the head of a powerful army collected from Illyricum and the East, he entered Italy. He was determined to revenge the death of Severus and to punish the rebellious Romansp122 However, due to the skill of Maximian, Galerius found every place hostile, fortified, and inaccessible. Though he forced his way as far as Narni, sixty miles from Rome, he controlled only his camp.\nAs he was facing difficulties, Galerius made the first steps to reconciliation. He sent two officers to tempt the Romans by the offer of a conference. These offers were rejected with firmness, his friendship refused. Unless he retreated, he might meet the fate of Severus. It was not a moment too soon; money from Maxentius to his soldiers had corrupted their loyalty. When Galerius began his withdrawal from Italy, it was only with great difficulty that he managed to stop his veterans deserting him.\nIn frustration, Galerius allowed his legions to ravage the countryside as they passed northwards. Maxentius declined to make a general engagement.\nWith so many emperors now in existence, in 308 Galerius, the retired emperor Diocletian and Maximian called an imperial 'conference' at Carnuntum on the River Danube. Its aim was to bring some order back into the imperial government. Here it was agreed that Galerius\u2019 long-time friend and military companion Licinius, who had been entrusted by Galerius with the defense of the Danube while Galerius was in Italy, would become Augustus in the West, with Constantine as his Caesar. In the East, Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar. Maximian was to retire, and Maxentius was declared a usurper.\nGalerius\u2019 plan soon failed. The news of Licinius\u2019 promotion was carried into the East, and Maximinus, who governed the provinces of Egypt and Syria, rejected his position as Caesar. Maximus claimed (and got) the equal title of Augustus. For the first, and indeed for the last time, six emperors administered the Roman world. Although the memory of a recent war divided the empire into two great hostile powers, their fears and the fading authority of Galerius produced an apparent tranquility in the imperial government.\nThe last years of Galerius saw him keep the position of first among equals. He spent the rest of his time enjoying himself, and ordering some important public works, such as discharging into the Danube the superfluous waters of Lake Pelso, and cutting down the immense forests around it.\nPersecution of Christians.\nChristians had lived in peace during most of the rule of Diocletian. The persecutions that began with an edict of 24 February 303, were credited by Christians to the influence of Galerius. Christian houses of assembly were destroyed, for fear of secret gatherings.\nBut in April 311 Galerius issued the general edict of toleration, from Nicomedia in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine. Lactantius gives the text of the edict in \"De Mortibus Persecutorum\" ('On the Deaths of the Persecutors', chapters 34, 35). This marked the end of official persecution of Christians. Galerius died on 5 May, 311."}

In this method, the garden space is divided into \"beds\", separated by paths. Each bed measures 4' \u00d7 4' ( \u00d7 ), therefore covering an area of (). These beds are further divided into sixteen squares of about one square foot ( per side, ). A different type of plant is grown in each of those squares.

Pentatonic scales are very common and are found in folk music from all over the world.\nAny scale using five notes is \"pentatonic\" (\"penta\" is Greek for \"five\"). However, the pentatonic scale which is used in most Western music uses notes which do not have any semitones. A pentatonic scale starting on C will use the notes C,D,E,G,A (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th notes of a major scale).. An easy way to find such a pentatonic scale is by using all the black notes of a keyboard.\nUsing the pentatonic scale is a good way for children to make up their own tunes. It does not matter too much which note is used for the start and the finish, because there is no feeling of a clear key. The notes always sound good when played together.\nMany folk songs are pentatonic, or nearly pentatonic. Well-known songs such as \"Land of the Silver Birch\" or \"Auld Lang Syne\" are pentatonic tunes.\nClassical composers have sometimes used pentatonic scales, especially Claude Debussy. His piano piece \"La fille aux cheveux de lin\" has a tune which is pentatonic except for one note. Maurice Ravel used it to write music which sounded Chinese, and in his \"Mother Goose\" suite (\"Ma M\u00e8re l'Oye\") which sounds like a fairy tale.\nThe pentatonic scales used in Indonesian gamelan music are called \"slendro\" and \"pelog\".\npentatonic song:\nsing out your melody\nsing out your song\nsing a pentatonic scale\nstarting on lah\nlah\ndoh\nray\nmeh\nsoh\nlah!\nDifficult words: Octave - An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name.\nFolk music - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music.\nSemitones - A semitone, also called a half step or a half tone, is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale (e.g. from C to C\u266f). This implies that its size is exactly or approximately equal to 100 cents, a twelfth of an octave.\nMajor scale - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \"octavus\", the eighth).

{"id": "55320", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55320", "title": "Major scale", "text": "In music theory, the major scale or Ionian scale is one of the diatonic scales. It is made up of seven separate notes, plus an eighth which is the same as the first an octave higher. In solfege these notes correspond to the syllables \"Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti/Si, Do\". The simplest major scale to write or play on the piano is C major, the only major scale not to require sharps or flats, using only the white keys on the piano keyboard:\nShape.\nA major scale is a set of steps in the order \"Whole:Whole:Half:Whole:Whole:Whole:Half\" (tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone). Western scales do not skip any line or space on the staff, and they do not repeat any note with a different accidental. This means that the key signature of the scale will feature just sharps \"or\" just flats.\nThe circle of fifths.\nThe Circle of Fifths was first described in 1728 by Johann David Heinichen in his book \"Der General-bass\". It has been used ever since as a way to show the relations between scales.\nThe numbers inside the circle show the number of sharps or flats in the key signature, with the sharp keys going clockwise, and the flat keys counterclockwise from C major (which has no sharps or flats.) The circle depends on enharmonic relationships in the circle, which is six sharps or flats for the major keys of F = G and D = E for minor keys (Drabkin 2001). Seven sharps or flats make major keys (C major and C major) that are more easy to spell with five flats or sharps (as D major or B major).\nHarmonic properties.\nThe major scale is used more often than the minor scale in Western music because of its unique harmonic properties. For example, the major third is much stronger in the harmonic series (it is the 5th, 10th and 20th harmonic \u2013 see below) than the minor third (the 19th harmonic)."}
{"id": "55321", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55321", "title": "Minor scale", "text": "A minor scale in music theory is any scale that has at least three scale degrees: the tonic, the minor third above the tonic, and the perfect fifth above the tonic. Together they make the minor triad. This includes many scales and modes such as Dorian mode and the Phrygian mode.\nIn simple terms, a minor scale is a series of notes with a sad, somber character (exaggerated when heard back-to-back with a major scale). A minor scale begins on the sixth note of its relative major scale, and is built with the following pattern of half steps and whole steps: \n\u2009i_whole_ii\u00b0_half_III_whole_iv_whole_v_half_VI_whole_VII_whole _i (next octave)\nUsually, when people talk about minor scales, they mean natural minor, harmonic minor, or melodic minor scales, which are the most common in Western music. \nNatural Minor.\nThe natural minor scale is the same as the 6th mode (or Aeolian mode) of the major scale. For example, the white notes of a keyboard from one C to the next C up makes a C major scale. If the white notes are played starting from the sixth step of that C scale, (from any A to the next A), then an A natural minor scale (the \"relative minor\" of C) is produced.\nHarmonic and melodic minor.\nThe harmonic minor scale is the same as the natural minor but with the seventh note raised by a semitone. \nHarmonic Minor Scale: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nFor example, in the key of A minor, the harmonic minor scale is:\nA B C D E F G A\nOne way the harmonic minor is different to the natural minor is that it has two chords which have the same structure when inverted, so they do not belong to any key. These are the diminished seventh chord (2nd, 4th, 6th and 7th degrees) and the augmented chord (the 3rd, 5th and 7th degrees).\nThe harmonic minor is also sometimes called the Mohammedan scale because its upper tetrachord is the same as the Hijaz jins, often found in Middle Eastern music. The harmonic minor scale as a whole is sometimes called \"Nahawand-Hijaz\" in Arabic, or as \"B\u00fbselik Hicaz\" in Turkish.\nThe interval between the sixth and seventh degrees of this scale (in this case F and G) is an augmented second. While some composers, like Mozart, have used this interval in melodic composition, other composers found it awkward. They thought that a whole step between these two scale degrees was better for smooth melody writing, so they used the subtonic seventh, or raised the sixth scale degree. These two options are called the ascending melodic minor scale and descending melodic minor scale. The ascending has the same upper tetrachord to the major scale, and the descending is the same as the natural minor:\nA B C D E F G A' and then \nA' G F E D C B A respectively.\nMany composers do not stick to the notes of only one of these scales when writing music. Using the triad of the relative major is very common, but because this is based on the third degree of the minor scale, the raised seventh degree of the harmonic scale would cause an augmented triad. In this case, composers usually use the natural minor. In jazz, usually only the ascending minor is used.\nFinding key signatures.\nMajor and minor keys that share the same key signature are called \"relative\"; so C major is the relative major of A minor, and C minor is the relative minor of E major. The relative major is a minor third above the tonic of the minor. For example, since the key signature of G major has one sharp (see major scales for how to find this), its relative minor, E minor, also has one sharp in its key signature.\nMusic may be written in an enharmonic scale (e.g. A major, which only has four flats in its key signature, compared to the eight sharps required for G major). The following are enharmonic equivalents:"}

It is the most common form of reproduction in prokaryotes such as bacteria. It occurs in some single-celled Eukaryotes like the \"Amoeba\" and the \"Paramoecium\". In binary fission DNA replication and segregation occur simultaneously.\nIn binary fission, the fully grown parent cell splits into two halves, producing two pools. After replicating its genetic material, the parent cell divides into two equal sized daughter cells. The genetic material is replicated, then equally split. The daughter cells are genetically identical (unless a mutation occurs during replication).\nDuring binary fission, the DNA molecule divides and forms two DNA molecules. The cell then grows to create room for each molecule to move towards the opposite side of the bacterium. At the same time, the cell membrane divides to form 2 daughter cells. After division, the new cells grow and the process repeats itself.\nBinary fission occurs in eukaryotic tissue cells, but the process is more complicated: see mitosis. \nBasically, a cell copies its DNA, and then splits down the middle, creating two daughter cells."}

They send information between neurons by crossing a synapse. Electrical signals are not able to cross the gap between most neurons. They are changed into chemical signals to cross the gap. Neurotransmitters act mostly on chemical synapses. Once they reach the next neuron they are absorbed. The neuron then changes this chemical signal back into an electrical signal called an action potential. The action potential passes across the next neuron and to the next synapse.\nMany neurotransmitters are made from amino acids, which are part of your diet and it takes only a few steps to convert them. Neurotransmitters play a major role in shaping everyday life and functions. Scientists do not yet know exactly how many neurotransmitters exist, but more than 100\u00a0chemical messengers have been identified.\nEach neurotransmitter has a different function. For example: dopamine is used in reward and pleasure and noradrenaline is used in an animal's \"fight or flight\" response. Neurotransmitters also regulate the passing of messages. This is because an action potential must be a certain strength before the neurotransmitters are released. The strength required to release the neurotransmitter is called a threshold.\nThe most common transmitter is glutamate, which is excitatory at well over 90% of the synapses in the human brain. The next most prevalent is called GABA, which inhibits at more than 90% of the synapses that do not use glutamate.\nNeurotransmitters are transported within neurons by small \"sacks\" called vesicles. When these vesciles come into contact with the neuron's cell membrane, it opens. This releases the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.\nDiscovery.\nUntil the early 20th century, scientists assumed that the majority of synaptic communication in the brain was electrical. However, through the careful histological examinations by Ram\u00f3n y Cajal (1852\u20131934), a 20 to 40\u00a0nm gap between neurons, known today as the synaptic cleft, was discovered. The presence of the gap suggested chemical messengers moved across the synaptic cleft. In 1921 German pharmacologist Otto Loewi (1873\u20131961) confirmed that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals. By experiments involving the vagus nerves of frogs, Loewi was able to slow the heart rate of frogs by controlling the amount of saline solution present around the vagus nerve.\nLoewi asserted that sympathetic regulation of cardiac function can be mediated through changes in chemical concentrations. Otto Loewi also discovered acetylcholine (ACh)\u2014the first known neurotransmitter. Some neurons do, however, communicate by electrical synapses through the use of gap junctions, which allow specific ions to pass directly from one cell to another."}

He has written other operas: \"The Mask of Orpheus\" (1984), \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" (1990), \"The Second Mrs Kong\" (1994), and \"The Last Supper\" (2000), .\nWhen \"Gawain\" was performed in 1994 at the Royal Opera House a group of hecklers booed and whistled loudly. However, this only made the opera more famous as lots of people read about it and came to hear it. He wrote a piece called \"Panic\" for alto saxophone, jazz drum kit and orchestra. \nIt was a very loud, harsh piece and it was a shock for the audience when it was first performed at the Last Night of the Proms, a concert at which people normally expect to hear music with easy, sing-along tunes."}

All of them are simple and aquatic, and most of them live in the sea. Some are colonial, composed of zooids which may be clones. Cnidarian zooids may take the form of polyps or medusae at different phases of their life.\nCnidaria take their name from special cells which have organelles that sting: the nematocysts. This device is largely responsible for their success: it is their main specialised and distinctive cell type.\nPronunciation.\nThe word Cnidaria is spoken without the initial \"C\", and with a long \"i\". So it sounds like \"Naidaria\". In a similar way, the term Ctenophore is pronounced as \"Teenophore\". Originally, a Greek kappa was in front of the words, and it was pronounced.\nSubdivisions.\nThere are five classes in the group. Jellyfish occur in four of the classes. \nUnranked, but now known to be cnidarians, is the parasitic group Myxozoa.\nBasic body forms.\nAdult cnidarians are usually either free-swimming medusae or sessile polyps. Many alternate between the two forms. Both forms are radially symmetrical, like a wheel and a tube respectively.\nMost have fringes of tentacles equipped with cnidocytes around their edges. Medusae usually have an inner ring of tentacles around their mouth. Some hydroids may be colonies of zooids which serve different purposes: defence, reproduction and catching prey. The mesoglea of medusae is a thick and springy jelly, so it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted. This makes a sort of jet propulsion.\nSkeletons.\nIn medusae the only supporting structure is the jelly inside their cell layers. \"Hydra\" and most sea anemones close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a kind of skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as \"Tubularia\" use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesogleal jelly with calcium carbonate spicules and tough fibrous proteins, rather like sponges.\nIn some colonial polyps, a chitinous periderm gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. Stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with sediment particles.\nFossil record.\nThere is a long fossil record for the corals, and soft-bodied forms appear in some exceptional strata. Some are believed to be among the Ediacaran biota."}

{"id": "55410", "revid": "864977", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55410", "title": "Calvinism", "text": "Calvinism belongs to the Reformed tradition of Protestantism. This tradition goes back to John Calvin and other theologians.\nImportant Calvinists from Europe include: Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Huldrych Zwingli, and from England, reformers Thomas Cranmer and John Jewel. Because John Calvin had great influence and played an important role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 17th century, the tradition generally became known as Calvinism.\nToday, this term also means the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches, of which Calvin was an early leader, and the system is perhaps best known for its doctrines of predestination and total depravity.\nHistorical background.\nJohn Calvin's international influence on the development of the doctrines of the Protestant Reformation began at the age of 25, when he started work on his first edition of the \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\" in 1534 (published 1536). Alongside the work he contributed to confessional documents for use in churches, Calvin's beliefs and practices left a direct influence on Protestantism. He is only one of many people to influence the doctrines of the Reformed churches, but he eventually became one of the most prominent theologians.\nThe rising importance of the Reformed churches, and of Calvin, happened in the second phase of the Protestant Reformation, when evangelical churches began to form, after Martin Luther, another important Reformer, was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. Calvin was a French exile in Geneva. He had signed the Lutheran Augsburg Confession in 1540, but his importance came from the Swiss Reformation. This was not Lutheran, but followed Huldrych Zwingli and then Calvin.\nTrue Calvinism (historical Calvinism) does not teach that God chooses who will be saved and who will not be saved. Instead, it teaches that for God's own glory, He recreates men with a new nature - a nature that loves God and hates sin - instead of men keeping their old nature, as if they kept their old nature, they would not want to follow God. Historical Calvinism also teaches that if God did not choose to save someone, there would be no-one to be saved.\nThe spread of Calvinism.\nAlthough much of Calvin's practice was in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas of a reformed church to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became the theology of most Christians in Scotland (see John Knox), the Netherlands, and parts of Germany, and was influential in France, Hungary, Transylvania, and Poland. Calvinism was popular as well for some time in Scandinavia, especially Sweden, but was rejected in favor of Lutheranism after the synod of Uppsala in 1593.\nMost settlers in the American Mid-Atlantic and New England were Calvinists, including the Puritans and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam (New York). Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonizers of South Africa, beginning in the 17th century, who became known as Boers or Afrikaners.\nSome of the largest Calvinist communions were started by 19th and 20th century missionaries; especially large are those in Korea and Nigeria."}
{"id": "55412", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55412", "title": "John Calvin", "text": "Jean Cauvin, also Jean Calvin (John Calvin in English) (July 10, 1509 \u2013 May 27, 1564), was a French Protestant theologian during the Protestant Reformation and was a central developer of the system of Christian theology called Calvinism or Reformed theology. In Geneva, he rejected Papal authority, established a new scheme of civic and ecclesiastical governance. He is famous for his teachings and writings and infamous for his role in the execution of Michael Servetus.\nCalvin was born with the name \"Jean Chauvin\" (or \"Cauvin\", in Latin \"Calvinus\") in Noyon, Picardie, France, to G\u00e9rard Cauvin and Jeanne Lefranc. In 1523, Calvin's father, a lawyer, sent his fourteen-year-old son to the University of Paris to study humanities and law. By 1532, he had attained a Doctor of Law degree at Orl\u00e9ans. \nIn 1536, he settled in Geneva, Switzerland. After being expelled from the city, he served as a pastor in Strasbourg from 1538 until 1541, before returning to Geneva, where he lived until his death in 1564.\nCalvin's thought.\nCalvin trained to be a lawyer. He studied with some of the best teachers of the Renaissance in France. Some of the training used newer humanistic methods of trying to understand, dealing with a text directly. The training was important for Calvin. When he started to believe in Evangelicalism, he used these methods with the Bible. He used the bible to form his thoughts. He taught and preached what he believed the Bible taught.\nReformers such as Jan Hus and Martin Luther are seen as original thinkers that started a movement. Calvin was a great logician. He organised a movement. He was not so much an innovator in doctrine. Calvin knew the writings of the early Church Fathers and the great Medieval schoolmen very well. Earlier Reformers also influenced him. Calvin did not disagree with the Scholastics of the Middle Ages completely. He used them and adapted their thoughts according to his understanding of the Bible.\nCalvin is often associated with the doctrines of predestination and election. He had similar ideas to the other magisterial Reformers about these doctrines.\nLast years (1555\u20131564).\nCalvin's power was very great in his last years. He was known all around the world as a reformer different from Martin Luther. Mainly, Luther and Calvin respected each other. However, Luther and a Z\u00fcrich reformer Huldrych Zwingli thought differently about the eucharist. Calvin's thoughts about it made Luther believe that Calvin agreed with Zwingli. At the same time, Calvin was sad that the reformers were not all together. He tried to join them together by signing the \"Consensus Tigurinus\". This was an agreement between the Z\u00fcrich and Geneva churches.\nCalvin's greatest help to the English-speaking people was by giving Marian exiles in Geneva protection. He did this starting in 1555. With the city's protection, they could make their own reformed church under John Knox and William Whittingham. They later carried many of Calvin's ideas back to England and Scotland. However, Calvin was most interested in trying to change his homeland, France. He helped the building of churches by giving out literature and offering ministers. Between 1555 and 1562, over one hundred ministers were sent to France.\nInside Geneva, Calvin mainly wanted to make a \"coll\u00e8ge\", a school for children. A place to build the school was picked on March 25, 1558. It was opened the next year on June 5, 1559. It was divided into two parts. One part was a grammar school. The grammar school was called the \"coll\u00e8ge\" or \"schola privata\". The other part was an advanced school called the \"acad\u00e9mie\" or \"schola publica\". In five years there were 1,200 students in the grammar school and 300 in the advanced school. The \"coll\u00e8ge\" later became the Coll\u00e8ge Calvin, one of the college preparatory schools of Geneva. The \"acad\u00e9mie\" became the University of Geneva.\nIn autumn 1558, Calvin became ill with a fever. He was afraid he might die before finishing his last revision of the \"Institutes\". Because of this, he forced himself to work. The last edition became much longer, so Calvin called it a new work. It was 21 chapters in the edition before the last one. However, in the last one, it was 80. This was because of more detail in the material that was already there: more subjects were not really added. Soon after he became better, he strained his voice while preaching. This made him cough violently. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs. His health became much worse after this. He preached his last sermon in St. Pierre on February 6, 1564. On April 25, he made his will. In his will, he left a little money to his family and to the \"coll\u00e8ge\". A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him. He died of septicaemia. This goodbye is recorded in \"Discours d'adieu aux ministres\". He remembered his life in Geneva. Calvin died on May 27, 1564. He was 54. On the next day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Plainpalais. People are not sure where the grave is exactly. However, a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's."}

It could be used to throw stones at ramparts, trying to break them down. It could also be used to throw things over the walls of a city. These could be corpses of animals or people that had died of the plague. Trebuchets were more accurate than other medieval catapults.\nHow it works.\nThe trebuchet works in a simple way. The basket of the trebuchet is filled with heavy rocks. This acts as a counterweight for the other end, which is usually filled with one large rock. Several men arm the trebuchet by raising the counterweight up and the firing arm down. At this point the arm is released, the heavy basket swings down and the arm swings up, launching the rock far and fast.\nThe sling adds an additional 10-15 feet of arm length and gives the projectile a whip like speed then releases. The sling gives the projectile most of its speed."}

He was the first British monarch with the family name Windsor. His father was Edward VII.\nGeorge was born in 1865. He was in the Royal Navy when he was twelve; he left the Navy to become king. George was crowned King and Emperor of India in 1911. He was married to Princess Mary of Teck.\nAs King during World War I, George and his wife visited the warfront regularly. He changed the family name to \"Windsor\" to remove any association with a German heritage, because Germany was very unpopular at this time. Among other things, he started the \"Royal Christmas Broadcast\" tradition. He was known for being a stamp collector. His sons Edward and George would later become kings of the United Kingdom and British Empire.\nGeorge was a popular monarch. Many people thought he was a good king. He died in 1936, at the age of 70. George was king for 25 years and 8 months. His granddaughter is the current British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.\nEarly life and family.\nGeorge was born the second son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). He married a distant cousin (his double second cousin once removed) Mary of Teck (later Queen Mary), and they stayed married until his death.\nGeorge was known as the Duke of York for many years until his grandmother, Queen Victoria, died peacefully at the age of 81. His father, Edward, inherited the throne gaining the nickname \"Edward the Peaceful\" for his hard work maintaining stability when tensions were increasing. Edward's death was greeted with great sadness across the empire, George describing him as \"my best friend\". By the time George became king Britain was the richest, most powerful nation in the world and during his reign the Empire expanded to its greatest ever extent.\nKing and Emperor.\nGeorge was quick to prove himself a decent and popular monarch. He became a symbol of British resistance during the First World War in which he, and his wife, visited the war front regularly. However, at home his popularity was waning with even H.G Wells referring to him as \"an alien\" because of his German background (his grandfather Prince Albert was German). Growing increasingly worried he changed the family name to \u201cWindsor\" to remove any association with a German heritage. He was seriously injured when thrown by his horse at a troop review in France.\nAs the war came to a close many world monarchies were abolished or diminished, yet under the reign of George V the monarchy remained very much firmly established and as popular with the ordinary public as his late father. He worked hard as King, visiting many places and meeting many people, from world leaders to working class miners. The King also made friendly relations with socialist Labour party politicians and trade union members. The King, if anything was ahead of his ministers and understood the Empire better. He advised the government during the General Strike of 1926 not to take a hard line against the protestor stating \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\" Again, unlike most ministers, George became concerned by the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. He warned that within ten years there would be yet another world war and told many to be suspicious of the Nazis. He was correct with war in fact breaking out just three years after his death.\nAmong other things, he is also credited for starting the Royal Christmas Broadcast tradition in 1932. His Silver Jubilee in 1935 was greeted with jubilations and was a very well loved king across all classes of society. Afterwards however his health suddenly declined. It was in these later years when George's relationship with his eldest son and heir, Edward, deteriorated. George was cross with Edward's failure to settle down in life and was angered and appalled by his many affairs with married women. Edward did not take royal duties seriously and, although quite popular, preferred partying and luxury, in direct conflict with George's sense of duty and hard work. George said of his son Edward: \"After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself within 12 months\", indeed he was correct: less than a year after taking the throne, Edward abdicated, causing the family damage to its reputation. George V was regarded as a wise King with good judgement.\nDeath.\nSeriously ill, on the evening of 15 January 1936, the King took to his bedroom at Sandringham House feeling unwell; he died on the 20th January. He was 70 years old. He lay in Westminster Hall before his state funeral. A night previous all his surviving sons mounted guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes as a mark of deep respect. Statues of King George V were erected across the world and he has been portrayed numerous times by actors.\nIt was not known until recently that he had been deliberately euthanized by his chief physician, Lord Dawson of Penn. Dawson issued a bulletin with words that became famous: \"The King's life is moving peacefully towards its close\". Dawson's private diary, unearthed after his death and made public in 1986, reveals that the King's last words, a mumbled \"God damn you!\", were addressed to his nurse when she gave him a sedative on the night of 20 January. Dawson wrote that he hastened the King's death by injecting him with a lethal combination of morphine and cocaine. Dawson noted that he acted to preserve the King's dignity, to prevent further strain on the family, and so that the King's death at 11:55\u00a0p.m. could be announced in the morning edition of \"The Times\" newspaper rather than \"less appropriate\u00a0... evening journals\".\nThis account, revealed in 1986, caused great astonishment.

Since people who speak different languages often need to talk to each other, it is actually very common for languages to \"borrow\" words from other languages. \nExamples of this can be seen in the English language because it has many loanwords. When the Normans took over England during the Norman Conquest in 1066, they made French the official language of England. Since then, many French words later became English words. For example, the English words beef, pork, poultry, and mutton are loanwords based on the Norman French names of the animals cow, swine, chicken, and sheep in that same order. In English, the loanwords mean the meat of those animals specifically. Since later the British Empire took over many different countries and people, they also borrowed many words from the languages of the people they took over. An example of this is the word \"jungle\", which is a Hindi word that has been adopted into English. \nLanguages often use loanwords because cultures learn about new ideas and inventions from people of the languages they borrow from. For example, in English the names of meats and wines often come from French, musical terms often come from Italian, and philosophical terms often come from German. Although native English speakers are now familiar with Chinese ideas and inventions, they are often called by their Japanese names in English because these were introduced to Americans through Japan. China, on the other hand, was closed off from the world when its ideas and inventions spread throughout the world because its communist government stopped communication with most outside countries, including America. \nThe names of food are some of the most common loanwords across languages because people may not have any idea of what the food is like when they are first introduced to a certain culture. For example, Italian food usually has Italian names like \"spaghetti\" and \"pasta\", Japanese food has Japanese names like \"sushi\" and \"tempura\", and Mexican food has Spanish names like \"tacos\" and \"carnitas\"."}

The main part of the lower courses of the northern ramparts dates from Gallo-Roman times.\nIn 462 the Romans officially left and the Visigothic king Theodoric II built more fortifications at Carcassonne, some of them still stand. In 760, Pippin was unable to take Carcassonne, although he was able to most of the south of France.\nIn 1067 Carcassonne became the property of Raimond Bernard Trencavel, viscount of Albi and N\u00eemes. Carcassonne became famous in its role in the Albigensian Crusades, when the city was a stronghold of occitan cathars. In August 1209 the crusading army of Simon de Montfort forced its citizens to surrender. He added to the fortifications.

{"id": "55499", "revid": "1124822", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55499", "title": "Colosseum", "text": "The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is a large artefact or structure in the city of Rome. The construction of the Colosseum started around 70\u201372 AD and was finished in 80 AD. Emperor Vespasian started all the work, and Emperor Titus completed the colosseum. Emperor Domitian made some changes to the building between 81\u201396 AD. It had seating for 50,000 people. It is the biggest amphitheatre built by the Roman Empire.\nThe Colosseum is in Rome, the capital of Italy. More precisely, it is on the east bank of the Tiber, the river that crosses the city, east of the ancient Roman forum. A forum in antiquity was a geographical area in which were the main buildings of power, as well as the large square on which the population met. It was both a busy place to live, a place to get married, big parties, community meetings, and so on. The stadium was less than a kilometer to the southwest, the Capitol was a little over a mile to the west.\nColosseum was first called the Flavian Amphitheatre or in Latin, the Amphitheatrum Flavium. This was after Vespasian and Titus who had the family name of \"Flavius\". It was used for gladiatorial contests, and other shows like \"animal hunts\", in which animals would hunt and eat prisoners; or in which gladiators would fight against animals. There were also executions of prisoners, plays, and battle scenes; sometimes it was filled with water to fight sea battles. The people of Rome could go into the Colosseum without any costs; it was free.\nIn the Middle Ages, after the mid-fifth century, it was no longer used for performances. It was then used as housing, workshops, a Christian shrine, and as a supply of building stones.\nIt is now in ruins because of earthquakes. The Colosseum is a symbol of the Roman Empire. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions. On Good Fridays, the Pope leads a torch lit \"Way of the Cross\" procession around the various levels of the amphitheatre.\nThe Colosseum appears on the Euro five cent coins.\nSighting views.\nThe building of the Colosseum began under the rule of the Emperor Vespasian in around 70\u201372 AD. The area was flat, in a valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills. There was a stream flowing through the valley, but this had been made into a canal. People had been living in this area for over 200 years, but the houses were destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. The Emperor Nero took much of the land for his own use. He built a grand palace, the \"Domus Aurea\" which had a lake, gardens, paths covered with a roof held up by columns (porticoes), and large shelters (pavilions) to sit in. He had the \"Aqua Claudia\" aqueduct made longer to supply water to the area. There was also a big bronze statue of Nero, the Colossus of Nero, at the front of the Domus Aurea. In 68 AD, Nero lost control of the government. The Senate made him a public outlaw, and he killed himself soon after.\nA great moment.\nTo celebrate the end of Nero's rule, the Emperor Vespasian built the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake. This was seen as giving back the land to the people of Rome. The Romans often built monuments to celebrate important events, and the Colosseum is a part of that tradition.\nMost of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land used for the Colosseum. Schools for gladiators and other buildings were put up in the old gardens of the Domus Aurea. The Colossus was left in place, but Nero's head was replaced. Vespasian renamed it after the sun-god, Helios (\"Colossus Solis\"). Many historians say that the name of the Colosseum comes from the statue, the Colossus. Usually in Roman cities, the amphitheatres were built on the edge of the city. \nThe Colosseum was built in the city centre; in effect, placing it in the real and symbolic heart of Rome.\nFights.\nThe Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished and the building opened by his son, Titus, in 80. Cassius Dio said that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the opening games. The building was changed by Vespasian's younger son, Emperor Domitian. He added the \"hypogeum\", underground tunnels used to hold the animals and slaves used in the games. He also added a fourth level at the top of the Colosseum to add more seats.\nRenovations.\nIn 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by fire. Cassius Dio said the fire was started by lightning. The fire destroyed the wooden upper levels inside the amphitheatre. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Theodosius II and Valentinian III (ruled 425\u2013450), repaired damage caused by an earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484 and 508. The last record of gladiator fights is about 435, while animal hunts continued until at least 523.\nThe Colosseum in medieval times.\nThe Colosseum went through big changes of use during the medieval period. At the end of the 500's, a small church had been built into a part of the building. The arena was used as a cemetery. The areas under the seating was used for houses and workshops. There are records of the space being rented as late as the 1100s. About 1200, the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and made it into a castle.\nDuring the great earthquake in 1349, the outer south side fell down. Most of the fallen stones were used to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings in Rome. In the middle of the 1300s, a religious group moved into the north part, and were still there in the 1800s. The inside of the Colosseum was used to supply building stones. The marble facade was burned to make quicklime. The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were ripped off the walls leaving marks that can still be seen today.\nThe Colosseum in modern times.\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, Church officials looked for a use for the big and ruined building. Pope Sixtus V (1521\u20131590) wanted to turn the building into a wool factory to provide jobs for Rome's prostitutes, but he died and the idea given up. In 1671 Cardinal Altieri said it could be used for bullfights. Many people were upset by this idea, it was quickly dropped.\nIn 1749, Pope Benedict XIV said that the Colosseum was a sacred place where early Christians had been martyred. He stopped people from taking any more building stones away. He set up the Stations of the Cross inside the building. He said the place was made sacred with the blood of the Christian martyrs who had died there. However, there is no historical evidence that any Christians had been killed in the Colosseum.\nLater popes started projects to save the building from falling down. They took out the many plants which had overgrown the building and were causing more damage. The facade was made stronger with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827. The inside was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The underground area was partly dug out in 1810\u20131814 and 1874. This digging was finished by Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.Mr. M and Prof. S saw a shadow of a unicorn, they thought they were probably hallucinating. So they went ahead with their tour.\nDescription.\nThe outside.\nThe Colosseum is a free standing building, quite different to the earlier Greek theatres which were built into the sides of hills. It is really two Roman theatres joined together. It is oval shaped, 189 meters (615\u00a0ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510\u00a0ft / 528 Roman feet) wide. It covers an area of . The outer wall is 48 meters (157\u00a0ft / 165 Roman feet) high. The distance around the building was 545 meters (1,788\u00a0ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The arena is an oval long and wide, surrounded by a wall high. Around the arena were raised rows of seating.\nThe outer wall was made from about of travertine stone. This was held together by of iron clamps. There was no mortar used to hold the wall together. The outside wall has been badly damaged over the years. Large sections have fallen down after earthquakes. The north side of the outside wall is still standing. It has triangular brick wedges at each end, added in the early 1800s to hold up the wall.

He received many honours, including his appointment as Master of the Queen\u2019s Music. His surname was \"Davies\"; \"Maxwell\" is his middle name, and his friends called him 'Max'.\nLife.\nDavies was born in Salford, Lancashire. He grew up in Lancashire. He learned to play the piano and started composing when he was still very young. After education at Leigh Grammar School, he studied at the University of Manchester and at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now part of the Royal Northern College of Music). He met other students there who became famous musicians: Harrison Birtwistle, Alexander Goehr, Elgar Howarth and John Ogdon. Together they formed a group which they called the \u201cNew Music Manchester\u201d. This group performed a lot of contemporary music (music that was being composed at the time). After a short stay in Rome he got a job as Director of Music at Cirencester Grammar School from 1959 to 1962.\nDavies wanted to study with other composers, so he went to the United States to study with Roger Sessions, Milton Babbitt and Earl Kim. Then he moved to Australia, where he was Composer in Residence at the University of Adelaide from 1965 to 1966. \nHe then returned to the United Kingdom, and moved to the Orkney Islands. Davies, who was openly gay, lived there on the island of Sanday with his partner Colin Parkinson. In 1977 he started a big arts festival on Orkney, called the St Magnus Festival. This still takes place every year. He often uses it to give first performances of new works (often played by the local school orchestra).\nDavies held several posts, including Artistic Director of the Dartington Summer School from 1979 to 1984. From 1992 to 2002 he was associate conductor/composer with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and he has conducted a number of other well-known orchestras.\nHe was given several honorary doctorates including one from the University of Oxford. He has been President of Making Music (The National Federation of Music Societies) since 1989. Davies was made a CBE in 1981 and knighted in 1987. He was appointed Master of the Queen's Music for a ten-year period from March 2004. He was also a professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music.\nMusic.\nDavies wrote a lot of music. Some of his first works used serial techniques, sometimes combined with ideas from Mediaeval and Renaissance music, including bits of plainsong.\nPieces from the late 1960s combine these ideas with expressionism and a violent character, for example \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\" which is about King George III. Written for a singer and a small group of instruments the singer has to shout and screech at times, and also act. He wrote an opera \"Taverner\" about the Renaissance composer John Taverner. The orchestral piece \"St Thomas Wake\" (1969) uses many different styles of music, including foxtrots (played by a twenties-style dance band), a pavan by John Bull and Davies's own modern style. Many works from this period were performed by the Pierrot Players which Davies founded with Harrison Birtwistle in 1967 (they were reformed as The Fires of London in 1970 and stayed together until 1987).\nMathematics played a part in Davies\u2019 music. In his work \"Ave Maris Stella\" he used a magic square. \"Worldes Blis\" 1969 shows the beginning of his more mature style. Some people think it is similar to Jean Sibelius. \nAfter his move to Orkney, Davies often used Orcadian (the adjective of \u201cOrkney\u201d) or more generally Scottish themes in his music. He sometimes set the words of Orcadian writer George Mackay Brown. He wrote a number of other operas, \"The Martyrdom of St Magnus\" (1976), \"The Lighthouse\" (1980, his most popular opera), \"Resurrection\" (1987), and \"The Doctor of Myddfai\" (1996). Davies also became interested in classical forms, completing his first symphony in 1976. He wrote eight numbered symphonies since, a Sinfonia Concertante (1982), as well as the series of ten \"Strathclyde Concertos\" for various instruments (pieces he wrote when he worked with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra). In 2002, he began work on a series of string quartets for the Maggini String Quartet to record on the Naxos record label (the so-called \"Naxos Quartets\"). His most recent one is No.9 (2006).\nDavies also wrote a number of lighter orchestral works such as \"Mavis in Las Vegas\" and \"An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise\" which featured the bagpipes and was played at the Last Night of the Proms in 1992 (with a bottle of whisky being passed round). He also wrote music for children including the operas \"A Selkie Tale\", \"The Great Bank Robbery\" and \"The Spider's Revenge\", and film music for Ken Russell's films \"The Devils\" and \"The Boy Friend\".\nMaxwell Davies's short piano piece \"Farewell to Stromness\" entered the Classic FM Hall of Fame in 2003.\nDeath.\nDavies died on 14 March 2016 on Orkney from leukemia. He was aged 81."}

{"id": "55518", "revid": "314522", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55518", "title": "Ambulance", "text": "An ambulance is a type of vehicle made to carry sick or injured people. Normally, ambulances go to people in emergencies to take people to hospital. Examples of emergencies include heart attacks, strokes, serious bleeding, broken bones, chest pain, serious head injuries, trouble breathing, and people injured in situations like car crashes and falls.\nThe first ambulances were used on battlefields, when horse-drawn carts carried badly wounded soldiers to field hospitals after the battle. Horse-drawn ambulances became commonplace in Europe and North America in the 19th century, as hospitals became common. Automobiles replaced horses in the early 1900s. Today's ambulances are vans which are converted into small mobile clinics. They can provide first aid, emergency care, various medicines and life support, and carry patients to hospital.\nAmbulances normally have emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics who work on them. They carry medicines and special equipment that can keep people alive. They also carry advanced tools for delivering babies in an emergency and restarting a heart.\nAmbulances are normally called by dialing a special emergency number, which is different from country to country. In the United Kingdom, this number is 999; United States 911; Europe 112. An emergency medical dispatcher then sends an ambulance.\nCrew.\nAn ambulance usually has two crew members. That way, one can drive while the other looks after the patient in the back. A \"paramedic\" will have at least a year of medical training, and can do fairly advanced treatment. Not all ambulance staff are paramedics. Those with less training are known as \"emergency medical technicians\" (EMTs) in some countries such as the United States, and \"emergency care assistants\" (ECAs) in the United Kingdom. In some countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, ambulances may have doctors or nurses on board.\nEquipment.\nIn the past, ambulances only gave patients a ride to hospital, or only had a first aid kit. This is still true in some parts of the world. In modern times, ambulances will have far more equipment and medicine. In some countries, an ambulance is like a mobile doctor's clinic.\nAs well as medicine and bandages, ambulances often have these things:\nWhen driving in an emergency, ambulances can break some road laws. For example, they can drive over the speed limit and through a red traffic light. They have flashing lights and sirens to warn traffic along the way.\nAir ambulance.\nAir ambulances became more common in the late 20th century. Helicopters carry the same kind equipment as a typical ground ambulance. In the United States, the Coast Guard runs a public air ambulance service using helicopters. There are also privately owned air ambulance services that provide for a wider range of needs, including international transport.\nAir ambulances are especially important in countries with low population density (few people, living in a vast area) such as Canada, Russia, midwest USA, Sweden or Finland. They can often save a life of a patient who would otherwise die because he could not be carried fast enough to hospital by other means."}

He was the third emperor of the Salian dynasty and one of the most interesting and important figures of the eleventh century. His reign was marked by the Investiture Controversy with the Papacy and several civil wars with pretenders to his throne in Italy and Germany.\nBiography.\nHenry was the eldest son of the Emperor Henry III, by his second wife Agnes de Poitou, and was probably born at the royal palace at Goslar. When Henry III unexpectedly died in 1056, the six-year-old Henry IV became king without problems. The Empress Agnes acted as regent, and the German pope Victor II was named as her counsellor.\nUnlike Henry III, Agnes could not influence the election of the new popes, Stephen IX and Nicholas II. These popes worked together with the Normans of southern Italy.\nBut the first great problem started when Nicholas claimed influence in the election of Germany.\nInvestiture controversy.\nGregory VII, a reformist monk, was elected as pope in 1073. This is when the controversy between emperor and pope began.\nIn the higher ranks of the German clergy, Gregory had many enemies. Therefore, King Henry declared Gregory was no longer pope, and the Romans should choose a new pope. When Gregory heard of this he\nexcommunicated Henry IV, declared he was no longer emperor and canceled the oaths the people had sworn to King Henry.\nThe excommunication of the king made a deep impression both in Germany and Italy. Thirty years before, Henry III had deposed three popes, but when Henry IV tried to copy this procedure, he did not have the support of the people. The Saxons began a second rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength.\nTo Canossa.\nThe situation now became extremely critical for Henry. It became clear that at any price he had to get his absolution from Gregory. At first he tried this by an embassy, but when Gregory rejected this, he went to Italy in person.\nThe pope had already left Rome. Henry tried to force the pope to grant him absolution by doing penance before him at Canossa, where Gregory stayed. For a Christian it seemed impossible to deny a penitent re-entrance into the church, and therefore Gregory removed the ban. But a new conflict followed because Henry IV thought the end of excommunication meant he was king again. But Gregory did not decide that.\nSecond excommunication of Henry.\nThe rebellious German nobles used the excommunication of Henry to set up a rival king, Duke Rudolph of Swabia (Forchheim, March 1077). At first Gregory seemed to be neutral because the two parties (emperor and rebels) were of fairly equal strength. But finally he decided to support Rudolph of Swabia after his victory at \"Flarchheim\" (January 27, 1080) and declared the excommunication and deposition of King Henry again (March 7, 1080).\nThis was widely felt to be an injustice. When Rudolph of Swabia died on October 16 of the same year, Henry began to fight to be king. In 1081 he opened the conflict against Gregory in Italy. Gregory had now become less powerful, and thirteen Cardinals stopped supporting him. Rome surrendered to the German king, and Guibert of Ravenna was enthroned as Clement III (March 24, 1084). Henry was crowned emperor by his rival, while Gregory himself had to flee from Rome in the company of his Norman \"vassal,\" Robert Guiscard.\nMarriages.\nHenry's wife Bertha died on December 27, 1087. She was also buried at the Speyer Cathedral. Their children were:"}

{"id": "55542", "revid": "7837651", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55542", "title": "Tristan und Isolde", "text": "Tristan und Isolde (\"Tristan and Isolde\") is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. As always, Wagner wrote the words for the opera himself. He took the famous old legend which had been told by the German poet Gottfried von Strassburg \nWagner composed the opera between 1857 and 1859. It was first performed, with Hans von B\u00fclow conducting, in Munich on 10 June 1865. Many musicians think it is the greatest opera of the 19th century. Wagner\u2019s dramatic handling of the story had enormous influence on many composers of the time. His harmonies were also an extremely important development in the language of Romantic music. Not everybody liked it. In particular, the music critic Eduard Hanslick said that he could not understand it.\nThe story of Tristan and Isolde was one of the great romances of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Several poets told the story, and each told it slightly differently. The themes of chivalry and courtly love are always there. \nThe story of the opera.\nAct I.\nIsolde, an Irish princess, and her maid, Brangaene are on Tristan\u2019s ship, being taken to King Marke\u2019s lands in Cornwall where Isolde is to be married to the King. The opera opens with a young sailor singing about a \u201cwild Irish maid\u201d. Isolde thinks he is singing about her. She is furious and wishes the sea would rise up and sink the ship, killing all on board. She is particularly furious with Tristan, the knight who is taking her to the king. She asks her maid to get Tristan, but he will not come because his is steering the ship. His henchman, Kurwenal, speaks crossly to Brangaene, reminding her that Isolde\u2019s previous fianc\u00e9, Morold, had been killed by Tristan and his head sent back to Ireland.\nBrangaene returns to Isolde to tell her about what was said. Isolde sadly tells her how, after Morold had died, a man called Tantris had been brought to her because he was seriously injured, and that she had made him better using her powers of healing. However, she then found out that his real name was Tristan. He was Ireland\u2019s worst enemy, and he was the man who had killed Morold. Isolde had tried to kill him with a sword, but when Tristan had looked into her eyes her heart had become full of love and she had dropped the sword. Tristan had been allowed to go back to Cornwall. However, it seemed now he had told his uncle, King Marke, all about the beautiful Isolde and had come to get her so that his uncle could marry her. Brangaene tries to make Isolde see that Tristan is doing an honourable thing to make her Queen of Ireland, but Isolde will not listen. She is furious, and wants him to drink a potion which had been intended by her mother for King Marke and Isolde as a love potion, but for Tristan it would be death. \nKurwenal now appears and says that Tristan has agreed after all to see Isolde. When he arrives, Isolde tells him that she now knows that he was Tantris, and that he owes her his life. Tristan agrees to drink the potion, now prepared by Brangaene, even though he knows it may kill him. As he drinks, Isolde snatches the rest of the potion from him and drinks it herself. They both believe they are about to die, and they declare their love for one other. Kurwenal comes and says that King Marke is arriving. Isolde asks Brangaene which potion she prepared and is told that it was not the death poison, but a love-potion. Outside, the sailors welcome the arrival of King Marke.\nAct II.\nKing Marke and his men are hunting at night. His castle is empty except for Isolde and Brangaene who stand by a lighted torch. Isolde keeps thinking that the hunting horns are far enough away for her to put out the flames, giving the sign for Tristan to join her. Brangaene warns Isolde that one of King Marke\u2019s knights, Melot, has seen Tristan and Isolde looking at one another lovingly. Isolde, however, thinks that Melot is Tristan\u2019s best friend, and, desperate to see Tristan, she puts out the flames. Brangaene goes to the castle walls to keep a look-out as Tristan arrives.\nTristan and Isolde can now tell one another they are madly in love. Brangaene tries to warn them that the night is ending, but they do not listen to her and Melot leads Marke to find the two lovers in one another\u2019s arms. Marke is desperately sad because Tristan has been betrayed and also because he himself had come to love Isolde. \nTristan now asks Isolde if she will follow him again into the night, and she agrees. Melot and Tristan fight, but then Tristan throws his sword to the side and is seriously wounded by Melot.\nAct III.\nKurwenal has brought Tristan home to his castle at Kareol in Brittany. A shepherd plays a sad tune on his pipes and asks if Tristan is awake. Kurwenal says that only Isolde\u2019s arrival can save Tristan. The shepherd says he will keep watch and pipe a happy tune to mark the arrival of any ship. Tristan now wakes up and is sad that it is daylight. His sadness turns to joy when Kurwenal tells him that Isolde is coming. He asks if her ship is in sight, but only the shepherd\u2019s sorrowful tune is heard. \nTristan sinks back again. He remembers that the shepherd\u2019s tune is the one he had heard when his father and then his mother died. He collapses. The shepherd now pipes the arrival of Isolde\u2019s ship, and as Kurwenal rushes to meet her, Tristan in his excitement tears the bandages from his wounds. As Isolde arrives at his side, Tristan dies while speaking her name. \nIsolde collapses beside him as the appearance of another ship is announced. Kurwenal sees Melot, Marke and Brangaene arrive and furiously attacks Melot because he had killed Tristan. In the fight both Melot and Kurwenal are killed. Marke and Brangaene finally reach Tristan and Isolde. Marke is terribly sad. He explains that he has heard about the love-potion from Brangaene and he had come because he had decided that Tristan and Isolde should be united. Isolde seems to wake but, in a last aria describing her vision of Tristan risen again (the \u201cLiebestod\u201d), then falls lifeless next to his body, uniting the two lovers in death.\nThe Tristan chord.\nThe very first chord in the piece is very famous. It has become known as the \"Tristan chord\". Although it had been used before, the way Wagner used it here was quite new. It makes the chromatic harmony very hazy, and the listener does not know for many bars what key the music is in. It creates a lot of tension. There are many other moments like this in the opera. The tension goes right through the opera. The story tells of a tension that can only come to rest through death.\nPrelude and Liebestod.\nThe Prelude and Liebestod is a concert version of the overture and Isolde's Act 3 aria, arranged by Wagner, which was first performed in 1862, before the first performance of the opera itself in 1865. The Liebestod can be performed either in a purely orchestral version, or with a soprano singing Isolde's vision of Tristan brought back to life."}

It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. The question was who would control appointments of bishops (investiture).\nThe controversy led to many years of bitterness and nearly fifty years of civil war in Germany. This war ended with the triumph of the great dukes and abbots, and the falling apart of the German empire in the end.\nThe dispute between Gregory VII and Henry IV.\nWhen Gregory VII, a reformist monk, was elected as pope in 1073, the controversy between emperor and pope began.\nGregory had many enemies in the higher ranks of the German clergy, so Henry IV declared that Gregory was no longer pope and that the Romans should choose a new pope . When Gregory learned of this he excommunicated Henry IV, declared he was no longer emperor, and told his subjects that they no longer had to obey him as they had sworn to do.\nThe excommunication of the king made a deep impression both in Germany and Italy. Thirty years before, his father Henry III had deposed three popes, but when Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he did not have the support of the people. The Saxons began a second rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength from month to month.\nTo Canossa.\nHenry had been excommunicated by this point, and facing widespread opposition at home with Rudolf as the figurehead of this, Henry met the Pope at a fortress in the Southern Alps. Over three days he signals his penitence in the snow, barefoot and wearing a sack cloth, leading to a reconciliation with Pope Gregory VII.\nSecond excommunication of Henry.\nThe opposition of the rebellious German nobles used the excommunication of Henry to set up a rival king Rudolf of Rheinfelden (Forchheim, March 1077). At first Gregory seemed to be neutral because the two parties (emperor and rebels) were of fairly equal strength. But finally he decided for Rudolf after his victory at \"Flarchheim\" (27 January 1080) and declared the excommunication and deposition of King Henry again (7 March 1080).\nThis was widely felt to be an injustice. When Rudolf died on 16 October of the same year, Henry, now more experienced, took up the struggle. In 1081 he opened the conflict against Gregory in Italy. Gregory had now become less powerful, and thirteen cardinals deserted him. Rome surrendered to the German king, and Guibert of Ravenna enthroned as Clement III (24 March 1084). Henry was crowned emperor by his rival, while Gregory himself had to flee from Rome in the company of his Norman \"vassal\" Robert Guiscard."}

The person at the front of the queue will have his turn next, then the next person and so on. When someone comes to join the queue they have to go to the back of the queue and wait until it is their turn. Sometimes people try to \"jump the queue\" or \"push in\". They are usually told off and have to go to the back of the queue.\nThe word \"queue\" comes from the French word for \"tail\", but when talking about a queue of people in English it is pronounced \"kyoo\" (like \"Kew\" in \"Kew Gardens\"). The word \"queue\" can be a noun (\"Please stand in the queue\") or a verb (\"Please queue over there\").\nA queue may also be a queue of vehicles waiting to get passed something or to go in somewhere.\nPeople may queue to be served in a shop, or queue for a bus or taxi or to go into something like a museum. Queueing is much better than pushing one's way in.\nSometimes, in places where a lot of people are queueing, there may be a system of numbered tickets. When someone arrives, they take a number and wait until their number is shown on a display board. This system is often used in banks, doctor's surgeries, passport offices, etc.\nPeople waiting in a queue are not always standing around. There may be people who, for example, are waiting to have an operation, but they have to wait \"in a queue\" until one day they receive a letter from the hospital telling them when to come in for their operation.\nRussians often make jokes about queues because, in the days of the Soviet Union, there was not much in the shops. When a shop had a delivery there would suddenly be a long queue of people. People joined a queue even if they did not know what the queue was for. If they bought something they did not want they could always sell it.\nPerhaps the most famous queue in Britain is the queue for promenade tickets (standing places) at the BBC Proms. People enjoy chatting to one another in the queue. The people who are at the front of the queue can have the first choice of where to stand for the concert. The word queue does not have any word families, however, it has many synonyms. Some of these are: Chain, line, row, and series. It only has two antonyms, and they are disorder and disorganized."}

It is usually made by mixing chocolate or cocoa powder and sugar with warm milk or water. Hot chocolate is usually drunk to make the drinker feel happier or warmer. Some studies have shown that hot chocolate may be healthy because of antioxidants that are in cocoa. Until the 1800s, hot chocolate was also used by doctors as a medicine against some diseases.\nIt is believed that the hot chocolate drink was first made by the Mayan people about 2,000 years ago. Another cocoa drink was made by the Aztecs by 1400 . The drink became popular in Europe after being brought from Mexico into the New World, and has changed a lot since then. Today, hot chocolate is used around the world. It comes in many different types such as the very thick \"cioccolata densa\" in Italy, and the thinner hot cocoa that is usually drunk in the United States.\nHistory.\nChocolate is made from cocoa, the dried and partly fermented seeds of the cacao tree (\"Theobroma cacao\"). The cacao tree is a small (4\u20138\u00a0m (15\u201326\u00a0ft.) tall) pine tree found in the deep tropical areas of the Americas. New studies show that the most found type of the plant first came from the Amazon basin. It was slowly moved by humans to other places in South and Central America to farm. Early kinds of another type have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, \"theobroma\", means \"food of the gods\". The fruit, called a cacao pod, is shaped like an oval, 15\u201330\u00a0cm (6\u201312\u00a0in.) long and 8\u201310\u00a0cm (3\u20134\u00a0in.) wide. It gets ripe from yellow to orange, and weighs about 500\u00a0g (1\u00a0lb) when ripe.\nThe first known use of cacao is chocolate found in jars at the site of Puerto Escondido in Honduras. It was used there around 1100 An early Classic Period (460\u2013480 ) Mayan grave from R\u00edo Azul, Guatemala, had cups with the Mayan words for cacao on them with traces of an old chocolate drink. The Maya are usually given credit for making the first chocolate drink over 2,000 years ago. The drink would be changed even more in Europe.\nTo make the drink, the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste and mixed it with water, cornmeal, chile peppers, and spices. They then poured the drink back and forth from a cup to a pot until a foam was created. The drink was served cold. Maya of all social classes could get the drink, but the rich drank chocolate from fancy vessels or cups.\nBy the 1400s, the Aztecs took over a large part of Mesoamerica, and took cacao into their culture. They thought of chocolate with Xochiquetzal, the goddess of pregnancy. They also used chocolate drinks as sacrifices to gods. The Aztec kind of the drink was bitter and spicy, and was called \"xocolatl\". It was made a lot like the Mayan chocolate drinks. Vanilla, chile pepper, and achiote were added to the drink, and it was believed to fight tiredness, which is because of the theobromine content, a mood enhancer. Because cacao would not grow in central Mexico and had to be brought into the empire, chocolate was an important luxury good in the Aztec empire. Because of this, cocoa beans were used as money.\nThe first time Europeans saw chocolate was in the 16th century when Montezuma (who was ruler of the Aztec then) showed \"xocolatl\" to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, a Spanish conquistador. What the Spanish then called \"chocolatl\" was said to be a drink made of a chocolate base with vanilla and other spices that was served cold. Montezuma's rulers were said to drink about 2000 cups of \"xocolatl\" per day, 50 of which were drank by Montezuma himself.\nBecause sugar had not come to the Americas, \"xocolatl\" was said to be something that one did not like in the beginning. The drink tasted spicy and bitter, unlike today's hot chocolate. As to when \"xocolatl\" was first made warm, sources are not sure about when and by whom. However, Jose de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, described \"xocolatl\" as a drink with a bitter taste that the natives liked a lot.\nEuropean changes.\nAfter defeating Montezuma\u2019s warriors and taking the Aztec's riches, Cort\u00e9s went back to Spain in 1528. He brought cocoa beans and chocolate drink making equipment. At this time, chocolate still was only the bitter drink made by the Mayans. Sweet hot chocolate and bar chocolate were not made yet.\nAfter coming to Europe, the drink slowly got popularity. The court of King Charles V soon began drinking it, and what was then only called \"chocolate\" became a popular drink with the Spanish upper class. Also, cocoa was given as a gift when the Spanish Royal Family married other royalty. Then, chocolate cost a lot in Europe because the cacao beans only grew in South America.\nThe first shipment of chocolate to Europe for sale purposes was a shipment from Veracruz to Sevilla in 1585. It was still a drink, but the Europeans added sugar to sweeten it, and took out the chili pepper. They also added vanilla, cinnamon, and other spices. Sweet hot chocolate was then made, making hot chocolate a luxury item with the European royalty in the 17th century. Even when the first Chocolate house (a store like a coffee shop now) opened in 1657, the drink still cost a lot. A pound cost 50 to 75 pence (between 50 and 75 USD now).\nIn the late 1600s, Hans Sloane, president of the Royal College of Physicians, went to Jamaica. There, he tried chocolate and did not like it, but found it was better with milk. When he came back to England, he brought the recipe with him, bringing milk chocolate to Europe.\nIn 1828, Coenraad Johannes van Houten made the first cocoa powder making machine in the Netherlands. The press took apart the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds, leaving a chocolate powder behind. This powder \u2014 like the cocoa powder used now \u2014 was easier to stir into milk and water, and led to solid chocolate. By using cocoa powder and a little bit of cocoa butter, bar chocolate was then able to be made. The term \"chocolate\" then came to mean solid chocolate, instead of hot chocolate.\nUse and types.\nToday, hot chocolate is used around the world. However, there are two main types of the drink. The main difference between the two is that one is thicker than the other.\nName.\nThe words \"hot chocolate\" and \"hot cocoa\" are sometimes used instead of each other, but there is actually a difference between the two. \"Hot cocoa\" is made from a mix of cocoa, sugar and ingredients, all powdered, to make the drink thick without cocoa butter. \"Hot chocolate\" is made right from bars of chocolate, which has cocoa, sugar and cocoa butter in it. The biggest difference between the two is the cocoa butter, which makes hot cocoa have less fat than hot chocolate, so it is better for one's health.\nHot chocolate can be made with dark, semisweet, or bittersweet chocolate. It is cut into small pieces and stirred into milk with sugar. American hot cocoa powder can be made with powdered milk so it can be made without milk. In the United Kingdom, \"hot chocolate\" is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water, and powder with chocolate, sugar, and powdered milk. \"Cocoa\" usually means a similar drink made with just hot milk and cocoa powder, then made sweeter with sugar.\nNorth America.\nIn the United States, the drink is most popular in powdered or crushed form. It is made with hot water or milk. This is the thinner of the two main types. It is very sweet and often is served with marshmallows, whipped cream, or a piece of solid chocolate. European hot chocolate first came to the U.S. as early as the 1600s by the Dutch, but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755. Hot chocolate is usually drank in cold weather and winter in the United States. It is not taken with meals very often.\nIn Mexico, hot chocolate is still popular. Besides the instant powder form, Mexican hot chocolate uses semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla. Hot chocolate of this type is often sold in tablets or bars which can be put into hot milk, water or cream. It is then mixed until the drink gets a creamy foam. Mexican cinnamon hot chocolate is often served with a variety of Mexican breads or pastries called \"pan dulcet\" (\"sweet bread\") and churros.\nEurope.\nIn Europe, most kinds of hot chocolate are very thick. This is because they are made from pure chocolate. In the United Kingdom, hot chocolate is usually thinner. As Europe was where hot chocolate was first made popular, there are many different types.\nAmong the thick types of hot chocolate served in Europe is the Italian \"cioccolata densa\". German types are also known for being very thick and heavy. Hot chocolate and churros is the normal working-man's breakfast in Spain. This style of hot chocolate can be very thick, often being like warm chocolate pudding.\nThere are even more types of thick hot chocolate in Europe. Some cafes in Belgium and other areas in Europe serve a \"\"warme chocolade\" or \"chocolat chaud\"\". This is a cup of heated milk and a small bowl of bittersweet chocolate chips to put in the milk. In England, some kinds of powdered drinks are as thick as pure chocolate kinds.\nHealth.\nEven though hot chocolate is usually drunk for enjoyment, it can also be good for the health. Hot chocolate has a lot of antioxidants that may be good for the health. From the 16th to 19th centuries, hot chocolate was used as a medicine and a drink. Explorer Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez wrote that chocolate drinks helped fever and diseases of the liver. Another explorer, Santiago de Valverde Turices, thought that large amounts of hot chocolate were good for fixing chest problems, and small amounts could help stomach problems. When chocolate first came to France in the 17th century, it was used \"to fight against fits of anger and bad moods\". This may be because of a chemical that makes a person's mood better in chocolate. \nThere are also some health effects which are not good. Hot chocolate has a lot of calories, saturated fat, and sugar. Caffeine from the cocoa in hot chocolate can cause bad effects.\nThere is evidence that the caffeine causes a mild addiction to the drink."}

Their members included Jim McGuinn (who later changed his name to Roger), David Crosby, Gene Clark, Chris Hillman and Michael Clarke. Later band members included Gram Parsons, Clarence White, and Gene Parsons.\nThe Byrds pioneered folk rock, a blend of folk music with rock and roll. Many of their songs were remakes of Bob Dylan's songs, such as \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", which was their first hit in 1965. They recorded a bright, uplifting version of \"Turn, Turn, Turn\", which had been adapted by Pete Seeger from Ecclesiastes in the Bible. Other songs were written by band members.\nThe Byrds recorded \"So You Wanna Be a Rock'N'Roll Star?\" about the Monkees, not liking the star-making machinery that made the Monkees famous overnight. McGuinn later said the song was about the pop music business, not the Monkees. They softened their opinions, though, once they'd met the band and saw they had real talent. Members of the Byrds played on Monkees recording sessions, and the later band Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash was formed partly from meetings at Peter Tork's house.\nOne Byrds song, \"You Showed Me\", became a hit for The Turtles late in 1968. The Byrds's lineup changed many times, and after the last new lineup disbanded in 1972, the original members reunited to record an album, titled \"Byrds\"."}

In 529, the so-called filioque clause was added to the creed. This clause is one of the main differences between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Catholic Church has this clause, the Eastern Orthodox Church does not. The clause is about how godly the Father is, compared to the Son. Where the original Nicene Creed reads \"We believe in the Holy Spirit ... who proceeds from the Father\", the altered, Roman Catholic version reads \"We believe in the Holy Spirit ... who proceeds from the Father \"and the Son\"\". Roman Catholic Christians accept this change, but Eastern Orthodox Christians reject it. Many Eastern Catholic churches (Eastern in liturgy but in full communion with the pope) do not use the clause in their creed. They do think the doctrine it represents is true, though, as this is a dogma of the Roman Catholic faith. Many Protestant churches who take a position in this matter, usually accept the \"filioque\".\nAfter the East-West Schism of 1054, the Eastern and Western churches attempted to reunite at two separate medieval councils, and the filioque was an issue at each. Despite Greek concessions, neither the Second Council of Lyon (1274) nor the Council of Ferrera-Florence (1438 - 1535) achieved the desired union.\nThe clause is most often referred to as \"the \"filioque\"\" or simply \"filioque\"."}

It is most commonly used during ceremonies at churches of Western tradition, including the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, Lutheranism, the Anglican Communion, and Western Orthodoxy. It is also used by evangelical Protestant denominations such as Presbyterians, Methodists, Congregationalists, and many Baptists.\nThe Creed is named the Apostles' Creed because it is made of twelve articles. People believed that after Pentecost, God inspired each of Jesus' Twelve Apostles to write one article.\nOrigin of the Creed.\nMany hypotheses exist about when and how the Apostles' Creed was created.\nMany suppose it comes from \"the Old Roman Symbol\" of the 1st or 2nd century, and was influenced later by the Nicene Creed (325/381).\nThis creed seems to have been made as an argument against Gnosticism. Gnosticism was a heresy in the early days of the Church. Gnostics believed things that were very different than what the Catholic Church taught. The Apostles' Creed, and other creeds, were made to be like examples of Catholic teachings, and to defend Catholic beliefs.This can be seen in almost every phrase. For example, the creed states that Christ was born, suffered, and died on the cross. This seems to be an argument against Gnostic beliefs, which said that Christ only seemed to become a man, and that he did not truly suffer and die, but only seemed like he did.\nBecause it was written very early in history, it does not talk about some issues that later Christian creeds, like the Nicene Creed, brought up. This makes it acceptable to many Arians and Unitarians.\nFor more information on the origin of the Apostles' Creed, see the detailed discussion in the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\".\nText of the Creed.\nLatin text.\n\"Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae. Et in Iesum Christum, Filium Eius unicum, Dominum nostrum, qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, passus sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus, descendit ad \u00ednferos, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit ad caelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis, inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos.

The other is in \"Common Worship\" (2000).\nBook of Common Prayer\nCommon Worship\nThe United Methodist Church.\nThe United Methodists commonly include the Apostles' Creed in their worship services. Their version of the Creed is special because it does not have the line \"he descended into hell.\" Except for this, it is very similar to the version in the \"Book of Common Prayer\".\nThe \"United Methodist Hymnal\" also contains (at #882) what it calls the \"Ecumenical Version\" of the Creed. This version is identical to the one in the Episcopal Church's current \"Book of Common Prayer\". This form of the Apostles' Creed is included in the \"Hymnal\" to be used during the Eucharist and baptisms.

{"id": "55697", "revid": "159298", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55697", "title": "Matcha", "text": "Matcha (pronounce: \"MA-cha\") also spelt maccha (Japanese: \u62b9\u8336), is a fine, powdered green tea. It is used in Japanese tea ceremony and for dying and flavouring foods such as mochi and soba noodles, green tea ice cream and different types of \"wagashi\" (Japanese confectionery). The most famous Matcha-producing regions are Uji in Kyoto (tea from this region is called \"Ujicha\"), Nishio in Aichi (tea from this region is called \"Nishiocha\") both on the main island of Honsh\u016b; Shizuoka, and Kyushu.\nMatcha costs more money than other kinds of tea. Its price depends on its quality (how good it is). It can be hard to find outside Japan, and also the special things that are used to make it and drink it.\nHistory.\nPowdered tea, stored and traded as tea bricks, seems to have been invented in China during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Making and drinking powdered tea was formed into a ritual (special ceremony) by the Chan Buddhists. These Buddhists use to drink from the same bowl as a sacrament.\nChan Buddhism (also known in Japanese as Zen), and powdered tea, were brought to Japan in 1191 by the monk Eisai. Powdered tea was slowly forgotten in China, but the 16th century tea master Sen no Rikyu made the rules of the Japanese tea ceremony. He said that \"matcha\" was the correct tea to use.\nProduction.\nThe preparation of \"matcha\" starts several weeks before harvest. At that time, the tea bushes are covered so that they do not get direct sunlight. This makes it grow slower and turns the leaves a darker shade of green. It also causes amino acids to be made, and these make the tea taste sweeter.\nAfter harvesting, if the leaves are rolled out before drying as usual, the result will be \"gyokuro\" (jewel dew) tea. However, if the leaves are laid out flat to dry, they will crumble and become known as \"tencha\" (). \"Tencha\" can then be de-veined, de-stemmed, and ground (pressed) with a stone until it becomes the fine, bright green, talc-like powder known as \"matcha\".\nOnly ground \"tencha\" can be called \"matcha\": other powdered teas are known as \"konacha\" (, lit. \"powdered tea\").\nNearly all the flavour of matcha comes from the amino acids. The best matcha has more sweetness and a deeper flavour than the normal grades of tea harvested later in the year.\nGrades.\nThe way that watcha is graded depends on several things:\nLocation on the green tea tree.\nLeaves that are going to be made into tencha have to come from certain parts of the tree.\nThe very top of the tree has developing leaves that are soft and supple. This gives a finer texture to higher grades. More developed leaves are harder, giving lower grades a sandy texture. The better flavour is due to the tree sending all its nutrients to the growing leaves.\nChlorophyll's relationship to tannin is also important. Younger growth is greener and stronger in colour, while more developed leaves farther down the plant have had their chlorophyll changed gradually into tannin, which gives a more bitter flavour and duller brown-green colour.\nTreatment before processing.\nTencha leaves are traditionally dried outside in the shade and are always kept away from direct sunlight. However, these days, drying has mostly moved indoors. Quality matcha is very green because of this treatment.\nStone grinding.\nStone grinding is quite difficult to do well. Without the right tools and technique, matcha can become \"burnt\" and is not such good quality.\nOxidation.\nMatcha must be kept away from oxygen. Oxidation smells like hay and affects colour and texture.\nPreparation.\nBefore it is served, the matcha is often forced through a sieve in order to break up clumps. There are special sieves available for this purpose. These sieves are usually made of stainless steel and combine a fine wire mesh sieve and a temporary storage container. A special wooden spatula is used to force the tea through the sieve, or a small, smooth stone may be put on top of the sieve and shaken gently.\nIf the sieved matcha is to be served at a Japanese tea ceremony, then it will be put into a small tea caddy called a chaki. Otherwise, it can be poured directly from the sieve into a tea bowl.\nA small amount of matcha is placed into the bowl, traditionally using a bamboo scoop called a \"chashaku\", and a small amount of hot (not boiling) water is added. The mixture is then whisked until it is all the same consistency (thickness). This is traditionally done with a special kind of whisk made of bamboo known as a \"chasen\". There must be no lumps left in the liquid. Ideally no ground tea should remain on the sides of the bowl.\n\"Usucha\", or thin tea, is prepared with half a teaspoon of matcha and about 75 ml (2.5\u00a0oz) of hot water. Some drinkers (and schools of tea ceremony) prefer to whip the mixture to produce a light frothy \"head,\" while others prefer as little foam as possible. Schools also vary on the amount of water and matcha. \"Usucha\" makes a lighter and slightly more bitter tea.\n\"Koicha\", or thick tea, needs much more matcha, as many as six teaspoons to 3/4 cup of water. Because the mixture is much thicker, blending it needs a slower, stirring movement which does not produce foam. Koicha produces a sweeter tea, and is almost always only served as part of Japanese tea ceremonies. Special chasen made for this purpose are often used.\nBecause matcha can be bitter, it is traditionally served with a small Japanese sweet.\nOther uses.\nMatcha is now a common ingredient in sweets. It is used in castella, manju, and monaka; as a topping for kakigori; mixed with milk and sugar as a drink; and mixed with salt and used to flavour tempura in a mixture known as matcha-jio. It is also used as flavouring in many Western-style chocolates, candy, and desserts, such as cakes and pastries (including Swiss rolls and cheesecake), cookies, pudding, mousse, and ice cream. Even the Japanese snack Pocky has a matcha-flavoured version.\nThe use of matcha in modern drinks has also spread to North American caf\u00e9 culture. Here, as in Japan, it is put into latt\u00e9s, iced drinks, milkshakes, and smoothies, as well as alcoholic drinks.\nPeople now realize that green tea and matcha are good for the health. This is why in North America it can be found in a lot of health food products such as cereal and energy bars."}

It comes from the plant species \"Camellia sinensis\". Green tea is a tea that has undergone little oxidation while it was processed. Green tea is popular in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and the Middle East. Recently it has been drunk more widely in the West, where usually black tea is consumed.\nHistory.\nIn the Kamakura period, a Buddhist monk, Eisai (1141\u20131215), and his follower, Dogen, first brought tea \"(maccha)\" to Japan. He had learned about tea on a visit to China. Eisai taught people to grow the tea plants, and how to prepare the tea leaves. People drank tea for its benefit as a medicine rather than as a refreshment. Tea-drinking gradually spread as part of Zen Buddhism. The tea ceremony was part of the training for mental discipline. Green tea kept the mind pure and relaxed, an effect caused by the caffeine in the tea. The custom of drinking tea gradually spread throughout Japan.\nIn the Muromachi period, tea tasting competitions were popular. People also gambled on these competitions. Zen Buddhist master, Juko Murata (1422\u20131502) stopped these competitions. He broke with the grand tradition, and developed a small ceremony performed around the tatami mat. The tea ceremony was perfected afterward in the Azuchimomoyama era by Jou Takeno and Sen no Rikyu (1522\u20131591). They removed all extra movements and unnecessary decoration and objects from the tea room. The idea, based on Zen, was to concentrate your attention on the wealth inside your mind.\nIn the Edo period, the tea ceremony spread out to the public, and it became an artistic accomplishment. Therefore, \"to draw out the beauty from inside the person's heart\" which was its original purpose came to be emphasized. The words \"\u548c\u656c\u6e05\u5bc2 (Wa Kei Sei Jaku)\" meaning harmony, respect, purity and tranquility, are the basis of the tea ceremony. Wa, harmony, is shown by sharing the tea between the host and the guest. Kei, respect, is shown by accepting and sharing with others. Sei, purity, is treating yourself and others openly. Jaku, tranquility, is the feeling of stillness in the ceremony. Modern tea ceremonies, which last for four hours, are still based on these ideas.\nIn the Meiji period, the tea ceremony died out for while. They were restarted when it was added in a kind of education for girls. The ceremony also changed to being beautiful and gorgeous.\nNowadays, green tea is spreading all over the world, but it seems to be drunk with sugar in some countries because it tastes bitter.\nEffects on health.\nGreen tea seems to lower heart disease expectancy.\nThe different substances contained in green tea also seem to help against cancer, low bone density, cognitive function and kidney stones.\nGreen tea contains ascorbic acid, and different minerals, such as chromium, manganese, selenium or zinc. It is a better antioxidant than black tea. Black tea contains certain substances which cannot be found in common green tea, such as theaflavin.\nStudies done on animals have shown that it can reduce cholesterol. Trials done on humans have not confirmed this effect, however. In 2003 a randomized clinical trial found that a green tea extract with added theaflavin from black tea could reduce cholesterol.\nIn a study performed at Birmingham (UK) University, it was shown that average fat oxidation rates were 17% higher after drinking of green tea extract than after a placebo was used.\nIn a recent study of the eating habits of 2,018 women, consumption of mushrooms and green tea was linked to a 90% lower occurrence of breast cancer."}

The top surface is made of woven straw. Traditional tatami are packed with straw. Nowadays some of them are packed with styrofoam. Tatami are individual mats. They have a uniform size and shape. They have borders of brocade or plain green cloth.\nTatami were originally a luxury item for the rich at a time when lower classes had mat-covered dirt floors. Tatami were gradually popularized. They finally reached the homes of commoners towards the end of the 17th century.\nHistory.\nJapanese people have used \"tatami\" since the Nara Era (710-794). They were knitted and became thicker like modern \"tatami\". People who lived in the Heian Era stepped onto \"tatami\" to show their power and they spread the \"tatami\" only in a necessary part of the room.\nThe use of \"tatami\" was a little different from now. The \"shoin\" style of traditional Japanese residential architecture began in the Kamakura Era. During this time, people stopped spreading \"tatami\" around the room and placing them in the middle. They started to spread \"tatami\" through the room. People decided to spread \"tatami\" by the hearth and sit erect with their legs folded under.\n\"Tatami\" has been changing together with people's life style. \"Tatami\" became common for people in the middle of the Edo Era. Farmers started to use them in the Meiji Era. The removal of \"tatami\" regulation made them more common in the Meiji Era. Japanese people often dry the \"tatami\". If the \"tatami\"'s surface was discolored, people often turned them over. With the economic growth after World War Two people started to use chairs and carpets. Japanese people think flooring is not relaxing or soundproof enough, so people still use \"tatami\" now.\nMaking Tatami.\n\"Tatami\" is made with a rush plant, \"igusa\". Rush is planted in the rice fields in August. The seedlings are dug out in November, and a good seedling is chosen. The chosen seedlings are planted in the rice fields again in December. By the end of June to the middle of July, the high-quality rush grows up to about one meter tall and it will be harvested the next year.\nThe rush should be dry after harvesting, and keep the peculiar smell and the color of the rush. The rush is selected according to length and the thickness, and it is checked for bruising. \nAfter the harvest ends, \"tatami\" is made. Because Japanese rooms are different sizes, \"tatami\" are made in different sizes. The base of the \"tatami\" is made first. \"Tatami\" is woven with a special machine. It similar to the weaving on a kimono. The next part is the wick of tatami, called \"toko\". When the \"toko\" is 40 centimeters or more thick, and the shape is straightened. The mat is complete, and that is called \"mushiro\". The \"tatami\" is complete when it is joined to the toko and the decoration on the mat edges are sewn.\n\"Igusa\".\n\"Igusa\" is a perennial plant of the family of \"igusa\". \"Igusa\" smells good. It has a fresh, grassy smell. In English, they are called rushes. \"Igusa\" blooms from May through June. The plant grows up to a length of 100 centimeters or less. They grow in marshes where sunshine is good. In Japan, there are 30 kinds of \"igusa\" growing in many different areas.\n\"Tatami\" is made from natural \"igusa\" that must be flexible from the root to the tip, and the thickness and the color varies slightly. About 4000 to 7000 \"igusa\" are used for the\" tatami\". Generally the best \"tatami\" uses more and longer \"igusa\" rushes.\nThere are many benefits in using \"igusa\" such as air purification, heat insulation, elasticity, cooling (especially in hot summer seasons), eco-friendly and sound absorbing qualities. \"Igusa\" \"tatami\" is also smooth to the touch, so it is comfortable for babies and young children. Most Japanese like \"tatami\". Many homes have at least one tatami room.\n\"Tatami\".\n\"Tatamiberi\" is the cloth that covers the edge and also decorates the \"tatami\". Some \"tatami\" don\u2019t have it. In English, it is called the mat edge. The width of \"tatamiberi\" is about three centimeters. The material on the \"tatamiberi\" is cotton yarn, a synthetic material string, and a gold thread. The features change according to what strings are combining with \"tatamiberi\". The woven beautiful color handle sets off the room. There are two types, and the atmosphere of the room changes by the \"tatamiberi\".\nThere are many kinds of \"tatamiberi\". But \"tatamiberi\" was used to show status. For example, the emperor, ministers, priests, and scholars had different styles. It was recorded in \"Amanomokuzu\" in 1420.\nJapan has etiquette about \"tatamiberi\". Japanese are taught not to step on the \"tatamiberi\". It is easy to tear \"tatamiberi\" when stepping in the weakest part. Stepping on \"tatamiberi\" fades the color on the edge of cotton and hemp in the \"tatami\". Therefore etiquette means \"not to hurt the mat carelessy stepping when you visit another house, pay it attention\". Also, family crests were embroidered on the \"tatamiberi\" in old times, too. Stepping on the family crest was taboo."}

He wrote a very large amount of music, but very little of it was published because he was more interested in helping younger composers than making himself well-known. Some of his best works include his symphonic poems and his film music.\nHis life.\nKoechlin was born in Paris, the youngest child of a large and rich family. His mother\u2019s family came from the Alsace near the French border with Germany, and he was proud of his Alsatian background. His grandfather on his mother\u2019s side had started a cotton textile firm in Mulhouse and his father worked in the textile business. When Koechlin was 14 his father died. He showed an interest in music, but his family wanted him to be an artillery officer. However, he had tuberculosis and had to spent six months getting better in Algeria. After finishing his schooling he was allowed to enter the Paris Conservatoire in 1890. Two years later he was studying composition with Massenet, and in 1896 he was a pupil of Gabriel Faur\u00e9. Ravel was a pupil in the same class. Faur\u00e9 had a big influence on Koechlin who wrote a book about him and helped him to arrange some of his music for orchestra.\nKoechlin became a freelance composer and teacher. He married Suzanne Pierrard in 1903 and they had five children. At first he was comfortably off, but after World War I the family lost a lot of money and they had to sell their country house.\nKoechlin had very free views about music, and this is probably why he never got a teaching job at the Piano Conservatoire. He also agreed with some things that the Communists thought. He did not like modern inventions like the telephone and radio. He looked like an old Russian patriarch with his long beard. He dressed in velvet trousers, sandals and a shepherd\u2019s cape for bad weather. He liked outdoor activities such as swimming and mountaineering. He was offered the Legion d\u2019honneur in 1940 but refused it.\nHis music.\nKoechlin composed in a variety of styles, even changing the style during a piece. He often liked quiet music with long chords which are played for the sounds they make rather than for giving the music a traditional shape. Sometimes there were no barlines in his music. He often composed in his head while on a train or climbing a mountain.\nHis works for orchestra include \"Les Bandarlogs\" which was based on the \"Jungle Book\" by Rudyard Kipling. Kipling\u2019s \u201cBandarlog\u201d are a troupe of monkeys in the forest. The music describes the monkeys, but Koechlin also gives it another meaning: he is criticising music critics, comparing them to monkeys. In the \"Seven Stars Symphony\" each movement is about a famous film star. They include Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Charlie Chaplin. He wrote a lot of chamber music and piano music, including some dances for Ginger Rogers.\nSources.\nRobert Orledge, \"Charles Koechlin (1867-1950) His Life and Works\" (London, 1989)"}

It is a conflict along ethnic and tribal lines that began in 2003. Many people and the United States Government, consider it to be a genocide. The United Nations currently does not see this as genocide.\nThose involved in the conflict.\nOne side of the conflict is composed mainly of the Janjaweed, a militia group recruited from the Arab tribes who move from place to place herding camels. The Sudanese government tells the public that it does not support the Janjaweed. However, it has provided cash and assistance and has even participated in joint attacks.\nThe other side of the conflict is made up of a number of rebel armies, including the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. These armies are recruited from Black ethnic groups who make a living farming the land.\nHow the conflict is dealt with.\nThe African Union sent a 7,000-troop peacekeeping force to Sudan. However, this force was poorly funded and under-equipped. So the United Nations decided to send an additional 17,300-troop peacekeeping force to help them. Sudan was strongly against this decision and saw the UN forces as foreign invaders. The next day, the Sudanese military launched a major offensive in the region.\nThe Sudanese government may have suppressed information about the conflict. Some witnesses have been jailed, others may have been killed. This started in 2004. Also, some evidence, such as mass graves was tampered with, so that it became unusable. Some people say this was done by forces which are close to the Sudanese government. In addition, by obstructing and arresting journalists, the Sudanese government has been able to obscure much of what has gone on. The United States government has described it as genocide. The UN has declined to do so. In March 2007 the UN mission accused Sudan's government of \"gross violations\" in Darfur and called for urgent international action to protect civilians there.\nEffect of the conflict.\nThere are different estimates of how many died in the conflict. According to Sudan's government, 9,000 people have been killed. On the other hand, many other people say that it could be from 200,000 to over 400,000. By October 2006, as many as 2.5 million people had to move because of the conflict.\nThe United Nations says that about 200,000 people have been killed in the conflict so far. Most non-governmental organizations use 200,000 to more than 400,000. The latter is a figure from the Coalition for International Justice that has since been cited by the UN. Sudan's government claims that more than 9,000 people have been killed, although this figure is seen as a gross underestimate."}

Prokaryotes were once thought not to have organelles, but some examples have now been found.\nThey are not organised like eukaryote organelles, and are not bounded by plasma membranes. They are called bacterial microcompartments.\nScope of the term.\nThe term is now widely used to refer to cellular structures surrounded by single or double plasma membranes. However, the older definition of a 'subcellular functional unit' still coexists. That is, the term is sometimes used for structures which are not membrane-bound.\nThe plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer with some proteins embedded in it. It keeps the ions and molecules of the organelle from merging with the surroundings.\nOrigin of organelles.\nMitochondria and chloroplasts, which have double-membranes and their own DNA, are believed to have originated from incompletely consumed or invading prokaryotic organisms, which were adopted as a part of the invaded cell. This idea is supported in the endosymbiotic theory.\nProkaryotic organelles.\nProkaryotes are not so complex as eukaryotes. They were thought to have no internal structures enclosed by lipid membranes.\nHowever, recent research has shown that at least some prokaryotes have microcompartments such as carboxysomes. These subcellular compartments are 100\u2013200\u00a0nm in diameter and are enclosed by a shell of proteins. Even more striking is the description of membrane-bound magnetosomes in bacteria. as well as the nucleus-like structures of the \"Planctomycetes\" that are surrounded by lipid membranes."}

It is divided into three federal states within Sudan: Gharb Darfur (West Darfur), Janub Darfur (South Darfur), and Shamal Darfur (North Darfur). It is currently in the midst of an ongoing humanitarian crisis that developed from the conflict between Ganjaweed militias and rebel groups (namely the Sudan Liberation Movement and Justice and Equality Movement)\nGeography and climate.\nDarfur covers an area of about 493\u00a0180\u00a0km\u00b2 (196,555 miles\u00b2)\u2014just over two-thirds the size of France and more than half the size of Kenya. It is largely an arid plateau with the \"Marrah Mountains\" (Jebel Marra), a range of volcanic peaks rising up to 3000\u00a0m (10,100\u00a0ft), in the center of the region. The region's main towns are Al Fashir, Nyala, and Geneina. \nThere are four main features of the physical geography. The whole eastern half of Darfur is covered with plains and low hills of sandy soils, known as \"goz\", and sandstone hills. In many places the \"goz\" is waterless and can only be inhabited where there are water reservoirs or deep boreholes. To the north the \"goz\" is overtaken by the desert sands of the Sahara. A second feature are the \"wadis\", seasonal watercourses ranging from small rivulets that flood only occasionally during the wet season to large \"wadis\" that flood for most of the rains and flow from western Darfur hundreds of miles west to Lake Chad. Many \"wadis\" have pans of alluvium with rich soil that are also difficult to cultivate. The west of Darfur is dominated by the third feature, basement rock, sometimes covered with a thin layer of sandy soil. Basement rock is too infertile to be farmed, but provides sporadic forest cover that can be grazed by animals. The fourth and final feature are the Marrah Mountains, that rise up to a peak at Deriba crater where there is a small area of temperate climate, high rainfall and permanent springs of water. \nThe rainy season is from June through September, transforming much of the region from dusty brown to green. Because much of the population of Darfur is agricultural, the rains are vital. In normal years, a crop is ready to be harvested by November. Once harvested, the dry stalks may be fed to domestic livestock. In the far northern desert, years may pass between rainfall. In the far south, annual average rainfall is 700\u00a0mm and many trees remain green year-round.\nEconomy and demography.\nDarfur has an estimated population of 7.4 million people. Darfur's economy is primarily based on subsistence agriculture, producing cereals, fruit and tobacco as well as livestock in the drier north. In addition to this, Darfur also suffers from frequent droughts during the summer and heavy rainfall in the winter. This has caused many farmers to provide inadequate crops causing the deaths of thousands of people.\nDarfur Conflict.\nThe Darfur conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the Janjaweed militia group and the tribes of the region. The United Nations estimates that over 400,000 people have lost their lives since the beginning of this conflict."}

Large grinding mills were usually powered by working animals, wind (windmill) or water (watermill) in the past. In the 2000s, most large grinding mills are powered by electricity.\nTypes of grinding mills.\nMortar and pestle.\nPeople who need to grind a small amount of a food, such as spices or grain, for their own cooking often use a hand-powered mortar and pestle or a hand-powered grinder, such as a pepper grinder. In the 2000s, many people also used electric-powered grinding mills. These kitchen appliances have a metal blade that grinds the food into small pieces. Electric-powered grinding mills are often used for grinding nuts or coffee.\nGrain mills.\nFor thousands of years, humans have ground their grains (such as wheat or corn) into flour using grain mills powered by animals (such as oxen or horses), wind (windmills) or by running water from a stream or river (watermill). In the 2000s, most grain mills are powered by electricity. \nMechanical process.\nAfter grinding the state of the solid is changed: the grain size, and the grain shape. Also, there may be more or less crushing.\nFor process engineering, several things are important: increasing the surface area of the solid; making the solid have wanted grain size; and pulping the material to the desired state (squishing it)."}

It converts the wind's energy into rotational energy. To do this it uses vanes called sails or blades.\nThe energy made by windmills can be used in many ways. These include grinding grain or spices, pumping water and sawing wood. Modern wind power machines are used to create electricity. These are called wind turbines by engineers or wind mills by the average person. Before modern times, windmills were most commonly used to grind grain into flour for making bread. The windmill has been in history for many years.\nHistory.\nAn organ powered by a \"windwheel\" was written about in the 2nd century AD by the Greek engineer Hero. It could have been the first machine in history that used wind power. Vertical axle windmills were used in eastern Persia (Sistar) by 60 AD. Horizontal axle windmills were invented in Northwestern Europe in the 1180s. This is the type often used today.\nEarly history.\nThe first windmills had long vertical shafts with rectangle shaped blades. They existed in Persia in the 9th century. There is a story about a windmill and the second caliph Umar (634\\644 AD). It is not known if this is a true story. These windmills were made of six to twelve sails. The sails were covered in reed matting or cloth. They were very different from European versions. A similar type of vertical shaft windmill with rectangle blades can also be found in 13th century China. They were used for irrigation.\nHow they work.\nThe blades or sails of the windmill are turned by the wind. Gears and cogs makes the drive shaft inside the windmill turn. In a windmill used for making flour, this turns the grinding stones. As the stones turn, they crush the wheat (or other grain) between them. In a windmill used for pumping water, turning the drive shaft moves a piston. The piston can suck up and push out water as it moves up and down. In a windmill used for generating power, the drive shaft is connected to many gears. This increases the speed and is used to turn a generator to make electricity\nWindmills in culture and literature.\nMiguel de Cervantes' book \"Don Quixote de La Mancha\" has an important scene in which Don Quixote attacks windmills. He thinks that they are violent giants. Because of this, La Mancha and its windmills are famous. This is also the origin of the phrase \"tilting at windmills\". It means an act of uselessness. \"Moulin Rouge\" translated directly from French, and means \"Red Windmill\". "}

A person can lose blood from an injury, a trauma or from a medical operation. Blood transfusions can also be applied as a treatment to certain diseases of the blood (like Anaemia, for example).\nBlood is not collected and used immediately. Instead it is kept until it is needed. The storage area is informally called a blood bank .

Information about transfusion and donation is available at the National Institutes of Health website .\nProblems.\nNot all people are able to donate blood to all other people. Testing for blood types usually prevents any bad reaction to a blood transfusion. However, there are special problems for anyone with rare blood groups. It is very important, in order to avoid any complications during a blood transfusion, to detect individuals with rare blood types.

Alzey in about 1098; died 17 September 1179) was a German writer, composer and mystic. She was an abbess who is well known for her literary works and her songs. She also wrote about medical and scientific things, and wrote letters to many important politicians.\nHildegard was born into a noble family. Her parents sent her to a monastery because she was the tenth child of the family. She took the veil (became a nun) at the age of 15. By the time she was 38 she had the title of \u201cmother superior\u201d. She founded (started) a monastery on the Rupertsberg in the Rhine valley near Bingen. Later she founded a daughter house on the other side of the river near R\u00fcdesheim. She travelled a lot and talked to many important people. She later had the title of \u201cabbess\u201d. After she died several popes suggested she should be made a saint, but this never happened. She does, though, have a feast day on September 17, which is celebrated in some parts of Germany.\nKnown as the \"Sybil of the Rhine\", Hildegard had many visions, many of which she wrote down.They were mostly about God and his relationship with humans, the church, redemption from God, and creation. She wrote lyrical poetry which was very colourful and had lots of visionary ideas. Her music does not use plainchant like the music of many other medieval composers at the time. It mostly has small patterns of melody which are repeated many times in slightly different ways. Her music was also different because the chants she wrote were written for female voices, in a higher range than earlier chants. This made them easier for women's voices. She wrote a morality play in verse with 82 melodies.\nHildegard of Bingen is the first composer whose life we know about. She may possibly be the first woman to write about female sexuality."}

But in most of them a god is in charge. Supreme god is regarded as a creator of the universe, an entity that exists and gives life to all things. It is believed to have created the universe and many other gods and goddess to be his helpers. Different forms (Avatars) of the supreme god are worshipped, depending on the Hindu tradition. The ultimate god of Hinduism is Still, The Parambrahman or the Ultimate reality\nHinduism believes All it's Devas are different forms of same NIRAKAR Parambrahman. Devas in Hinduism are thought as highly advanced spiritual beings and are often represented in human form or partially human and partially animal forms. Sometimes they are also represented as non-living things and plants.\nThe three gods who started creation: Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva are called Bhagwans (also known as Bhagav\u0101n). Yakshas are all male gods created by the three Bhagwans. \nThe main god in Vaishnavite sect of Hinduism is Vishnu. Vishnu is the Supreme Brahman, According to many Vaishnava Scriptures. Shiva is the Supreme, in Shaivite Traditions while in Shakti Traditions, Adi Parshakti is supreme. Other names such as Ishvara, Bhagavan, Bhagvati and Daiva also means Hindu gods and all of them mainly denote Brahman. According to scriptures lord Shiva is considered to be the supreme god due to his patience and complete control over anger. He is believed to have a third eye which causes destruction once opened.\n Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma are the major gods and Lakshmi, Parvati and Saraswati are the major goddesses in Hinduism. Many Hindus believe that Brahma is the Creator, Vishnu is the preserver and Shiva or Maheshwar is destroyer.\nSupreme God.\nParambrahman is the supreme God of Hinduism. Most Hindus worship one Supreme Being, though by different names. This is because the peoples of India with different languages and cultures have understood the one God in their own distinct way. \nRegional and family traditions can play a large part in influencing this choice. Through history four principal Hindu denominations arose \u2014Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Shaivism, and Smartism. \nFor Vaishnavites, Lord Maha Vishnu is God Of Supreme, For Shaktas, Goddess Shakti is supreme, For Shaivites, God Shiva is Supreme. For Smartas\u2014who see all Deities as reflections of the One God\u2014the choice of Deity is left to the devotee.\nMost Hindus, in their daily devotional practices, worship some form of a personal aspect of God, although they believe in the more abstract concept of a Supreme God as well. \nThey generally choose one concept of God, and cultivate devotion to that chosen form, while at the same time respecting the chosen ideals of other people. The many different names given to the Supreme God in Hinduism encourage a multiplicity of paths, as opposed to conformity to just one. \nThe unique understanding in Hinduism is that God is not far away, living in a remote heaven, but is all-pervasive and energizes the entire universe. He is also inside each soul, waiting to be discovered. Knowing the one Supreme God in this intimate and experiential way is the goal of Hindu spirituality.\nOther gods.\nHindus also believe in many Gods (Devas) who perform various functions, like executives in a large corporation. These should not be confused with the Supreme God. \nThese deities are highly advanced beings who have specific duties and powers\u2014not unlike the heavenly spirits, overlords or archangels that are mystical actors revered in other faiths. Each denomination worships the Supreme God and its own set of divine beings.\nDevas (also called Devat\u0101s) constitute an integral part of the colorful Hindu culture. These various forms of God are represented in innumerable paintings, statues, murals, and scriptural stories that can be found in temples, homes, businesses, and other places. \nIn Hinduism the scriptures recommend that for the satisfaction of a particular material desire a person may worship a particular deity. For example, shopkeepers frequently keep a statue or picture of the devi Lakshmi in their shops.\nBhuvaneswari.\nThe concept of Goddess Bhuvaneswari as the supreme goddess emerged in historical religious literature as a term to define the powerful and influential nature of female deities in India. Throughout history, goddesses have been portrayed as the mother of the universe, through whose powers the universe is created and destroyed. The gradual changes in belief through time shape the concept of Bhuvaneswari and express how the different Goddesses, though very different in personality, all carry the power of the universe on their shoulders."}

This band was called Beautiful Loser. It had Travis Stever singing and playing guitar, Claudio Sanchez on guitar, Nate Kelley on drums and Jon Carleo on bass. The group did not last long, it broke up in June of 1995; they had an argument about gas money. Stever left the band, and Kelley was kicked out, but he came back when Sanchez asked him to. Without Stever, the band only had three people, so Sanchez started to sing and play guitar.\nShab\u00fctie.\nThey changed their name to Shab\u00fctie, a chant taken from the movie \"The Naked Prey\". The band constantly changed and experimented with different genres and styles, never properly deciding a set genre. When Carleo left the band in August 1996, Kelley asked Michael Todd to join the band, who he had worked with in an acoustic project called \"Esme 9\". Todd, a guitar player, started playing bass because of Shab\u00fctie.\nCoheed and Cambria (2000 \u2014 2006).\nAfter Kelley left, Sanchez and the other people picked Josh Eppard, who was in the band \"3\", to take his place. In 2001, shortly after The Delirium Trigger EP was made, they changed their name to Coheed and Cambria and Shab\u00fctie was finished. The band was now a four piece: Claudio Sanchez, (lead vocals/guitar), Travis Stever, (backup vocals/guitar), Michael Todd, (backup vocals/bass guitar), and Josh Eppard, (drums). When playing live, Dave Parker (keyboards/guitar), sometimes plays too.\nRecent times (2006\u2014).\nJosh Eppard could not play at Coheed and Cambria's June 9 slot at the Download Festival in the UK because he was ill. A few days later, the band canceled the Barcelona and Essen parts of their European tour. \nIn November 2006, it was announced that both Josh Eppard and Mic Todd had left the band. \nA few months after, Mic Todd returned to work on the No World For Tomorrow with the band.\nIt was announced a few days before the band embarked on Warped Tour '07 that Chris Pennie, the former drummer for Dillinger Escape Plan, is working with the band in studio. \nThe band debuted their first single from No World For Tomorrow, The Running Free during Warped Tour '07.\nIn July, a website registered to Sony appeared on the internet, www.noworldfortomorrow.com. This website contained a countdown.\nAfter this countdown ended, a message was released and another countdown appeared. This showed that a message would be released weekly.

The next album has been called \"Most Anticipated Album of 2007\" by the \"Alternative Press\" magazine. The February 2007 issue of \"Kerrang!\" says, \"Among the songs that may or may not appear on the album are 'Gravemakers And Gunslingers' and 'The Hound Of Blood And Rank.'\" Also, the issue says that a release should come out in either late spring or early summer.\nOther Songs.\nA cover of Night Ranger's 'Sister Christian' was released by the band via the bands official website as an MP3 download as a Christmas present to their fans. Similarly, a cover of The Band's \"I Shall Be Released\" was uploaded onto the bands MySpace page as a Christmas Present to their fans in 2006. The band also used to play a cover of Iron Maiden's \"The Trooper\" at concerts. A song called \"The Glass\" was in the process of being written for the movie Spiderman 2's soundtrack, but the song was not finished in time and it was scrapped. Many Shab\u00fctie songs are circulated on the internet. Some were recorded in a studio, but others were recorded on a 4-track, resulting in poor quality audio. There is also a live bootleg on the internet of a song played by Shab\u00fctie that fans named \"Nauraushaun\". It was assumed that this song was one song in full, but former drummer Nate Kelley has recently told fans that the song was in fact two songs played in a medley. These two songs are \"Origins\" and \"Life Without You\". These two songs were never recorded except for the bootleg that has been circulating, although \"Life Without You\" was almost recorded instead of \"Cassiopeia\". In the end the band decided they liked \"Cassiopeia\" more and this was recorded instead.\nMusic videos.\nA series of six vignettes that showcase music from \"Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness\" were made and are on the albums' special edition bonus DVD."}

A watermill that only generates electricity is more usually called a hydroelectric plant.\nHistory.\nChina.\nIn 31 AD, a Chinese engineer named Du Shi (Wade-Giles: Tu Shih) \"\"invented the first water-powered bellows. This was a complicated machine with gears, axles, and levers that was powered by a waterwheel\",\". This invention aided the forging of cast iron smelted from the blast furnace. More extensive descriptions appear in literature of the 5th century.\nGreece and Rome.\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans used the technology. In the 1st century BC, the Greek epigrammatist \"Antipater of Thessalonica\" was the first to make a reference to the waterwheel. He praised it for its use in grinding grain and the reduction of human labor.\nThe Romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other countries of the Roman Empire. So-called 'Greek Mills' used water wheels with a vertically mounted shaft. A \"Roman Mill\" features a horizontally-mounted shaft. Greek style mills are the older and simpler of the two designs, but only operate well with high water velocities and with small diameter millstones. Roman style mills are more complicated as they require gears transmit the power from a shaft with a horizontal axis to one with a vertical axis. An example of a Roman era watermill would be the early 4th century site at Barbegal in southern France, where 16 overshot waterwheels were used to power an enormous flour mill.\nThe Cistercian Order built huge mill complexes all over Western Europe during the medieval period.\nMedieval Europe.\nIn a 2005 survey the scholar Adam Lucas identified the following first appearances of various industrial mill types in Western Europe. Noticeable is the preeminent role of France in the introduction of new innovative uses of waterpower.\nOperation of a watermill.\nTypically, water is diverted from a river or impoundment or mill pond to a turbine or water wheel, along a channel or pipe (variously known as a flume, head race, mill race, leat, leet, lade (Scots) or penstock). The force of the water's movement drives the blades of a wheel or turbine, which in turn rotates an axle that drives the mill's other machinery. Water leaving the wheel or turbine is drained through a tail race, but this channel may also be the head race of yet another wheel, turbine or mill. The passage of water is controlled by sluice gates that allow maintenance and some measure of flood control; large mill complexes may have dozens of sluices controlling complicated interconnected races that feed multiple buildings and industrial processes.\nWatermills can be divided into two kinds, one with a horizontal waterwheel on a vertical axle, and the other with a vertical wheel on a horizontal axle. The oldest of these were horizontal mills in which the force of the water, striking a simple paddle wheel set horizontally in line with the flow turned a runner stone balanced on the rynd which is atop a shaft leading directly up from the wheel. The bedstone does not turn. The problem with this type of mill arose from the lack of gearing; the speed of the water directly set the maximum speed of the runner stone which, in turn, set the rate of milling."}

Water wheels and hydropower was widely used in the Middle Ages, powering most industry in Europe, along with the windmill. The most common use of the water wheel was to mill flour in gristmills, but other uses included foundry work and machining, and pounding linen for use in paper.\nA water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load. A channel created for the water to follow after leaving the wheel is commonly referred to as a \"tailrace.\"\nHistory.\n\"Main article:\" Watermill\nGreco-Roman Europe.\nThe technology of the water wheel had long been known, but it was not put into widespread use until the Middle Ages when an acute shortage of labor made machines such as the water wheel cost effective. However, the water wheels in ancient Rome and ancient China found many practical uses in powering mills for pounding grain and other substances. The Romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other countries of the Roman Empire. The Romans were known to use waterwheels extensively in mining projects, with enormous Roman-era waterwheels found in places like modern-day Spain. In the 1st century BC, the Greek epigrammatist \"Antipater of Thessalonica\" was the first to make a reference to the waterwheel.\nAncient China.\nBy at least the 1st century AD, the Chinese of the Eastern Han Dynasty began to use waterwheels to crush grain in mills and to power the piston-bellows in forging iron ore into cast iron.\nIn the text known as the \"Xin Lun\" written by Huan Tan about 20 AD (during the usurpation of Wang Mang), it states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar, which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device (see trip hammer). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel was in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China.\nIn the year 31 AD, the engineer and Prefect of Nanyang, Du Shi, applied a complex use of the waterwheel and machinery to power the bellows of the blast furnace to create cast iron. \nWaterwheels in China found practical uses such as this, as well as extraordinary use. The inventor Zhang Heng (78\u2013139) was the first in history to apply motive power in rotating the astronomical instrument of an armillary sphere, by use of a waterwheel. The mechanical engineer Ma Jun (200\u2013265) once used a waterwheel to power and operate a large mechanical puppet theater for Emperor Ming of Wei.\nMedieval Europe and Modern.\nCistercian monasteries, in particular, made extensive use of water wheels to power mills of many kinds. An early example of a very large waterwheel is still extant at the early 13th century Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda, a Cistercian monastery in the Aragon region of Spain. Grist mills (for corn) were undoubtedly the most common, but there were also sawmills, fulling mills and mills to fulfill many other labor-intensive tasks. The water wheel remained competitive with the steam engine well into the Industrial Revolution.\nThe main difficulty of water wheels was their inseparability from water. This meant that mills often needed to be located far from population centers and away from natural resources. Water mills were still in commercial use well into the twentieth century, however.\nOvershot &amp; pitchback waterwheels are suitable where there is a small stream with a height difference of more than 2 meters, often in association with a small reservoir. Breastshot and undershot wheels can be used on rivers or high volume flows with large reservoirs. \nThe most powerful waterwheel built in the United Kingdom was the 100\u00a0hp Quarry Bank Mill Waterwheel near Manchester. A high breastshot design, it was retired in 1904 and replaced with several turbines. It has now been restored and is a museum open to the public.\nModern Hydro-electric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill to turn a wheel.

For direct mechanical power transmission industries that used hydropower had to be near the waterfall. For example, during the last half of the 19th century, many grist mills were built at Saint Anthony Falls, to use the 50 foot (15 metre) drop in the Mississippi River. The mills were important for the growth of Minneapolis. Today the largest use of hydropower is for electric power generation. That allows low cost energy to be used at long distances from the watercourse. \nTypes of water power.\nThere are many forms of water power:\nHydroelectric power.\n\"Main article: Hydroelectricity\"\nHydroelectric power is a means of making electricity without burning fuel. Hydroelectric power supplies about 715,000 MWe or 19% of world electricity (16% in 2003). Large dams are still being designed. Apart from a few countries with plenty of it, hydro power is normally applied to peak load demand because it is readily stopped and started. Nevertheless, hydroelectric power is probably not a major option for future energy production in the developed nations, because most major sites within these nations are either already being exploited or are unavailable for other reasons, such as environmental considerations.\nHydropower produces essentially no carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions, in contrast to burning fossil fuels, and is not a significant contributor to global warming through CO2.\nHydroelectric power can be far less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuel or nuclear energy. Areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry. Environmental concerns about the effects of reservoirs may prohibit development of economic hydropower sources.\nTidal power.\nHarnessing the tides in a bay or estuary has been achieved in France (since 1966), Canada and Russia, and could be achieved in other areas with a large tidal range. The trapped water turns turbines as it is released through the tidal barrage in either direction. Another possible fault is that the system would generate electricity most efficiently in bursts every six hours (once every tide). This limits how tidal energy can be used. \nTidal stream power.\nA relatively new technology, tidal stream generators draw energy from currents in much the same way that wind generators do. The higher density of water means that a single generator can provide significant power. This technology is at the early stages of development and will need more research before it can produce any higher amount of energy.\nBut several prototypes were tested in the UK, in France and the USA. Already in 2003 a turbine that produces 300 kW was tested in the UK.\nThe Canadian company Blue Energy has plans for installing very large arrays tidal current devices mounted in what they call a 'tidal fence' in various locations around the world, based on a vertical axis turbine design.\nWave power.\nPower from ocean surface wave motion might produce much more energy than tides. It has been tested that it is possible to produce energy from waves, particularly in Scotland in the UK. But there are still a lot of technical problems.\nA prototype shore based wave power generator is being constructed at \"Port Kembla\" in Australia and is expected to generate up to 500 MWh annually. Wave energy is captured by an air driven generator and converted to electricity. For countries with large coastlines and rough sea conditions, the energy of waves offers the possibility of generating electricity in utility volumes. Excess power during rough seas could be used to produce hydrogen."}

It grew to cover much of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia with a reputation for low prices on groceries. It claims to be \"Australia's Original Discount Grocer\".\nFranklins was the first supermarket in Australia to have brand name products. These products are called No Frills.

Today, a mascot of Franklins called Red Sock advertises these products.\nFranklins offers a wide range of products including No Frills. Franklins mostly deals in food and everyday articles. It even has Franklins brand name products like bread and meat.\nA wide range of people shop at Franklins to buy a wide range of articles. In some shops, people can buy their food and everyday articles at Franklins. They can then buy their fresh food outside of the store. In other stores, people can get fresh food articles as well as food and everyday articles all in the one place. Franklins even has a 'bottle shop' inside a few stores where people can get their beer and wine from. These places are both cheap and convenient to shop in.\nWhen Franklins first started, their business philosophy was like Aldi's: \"No extras, no service, no music and no electronic cash - only articles at extremely low prices\" or as Franklins had put it: \"Strictly No Frills\". Because of big competition with other \"good-looking\" shops, it no longer follows this philosophy.\nFranklins is still cheap but it has more competition from other markets, such as Aldi. Today, Franklins is owned by the Pick n Pay supermarket company from the country of South Africa. It has opened \"Franklins Family Supermarkets\" in 2006, independently franchise shops of both Franklins and Pick n Pay."}

{"id": "55905", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55905", "title": "Water turbine", "text": "A water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water.\nWater turbines were developed in the nineteenth century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids. Now they are mostly used for electric power generation. They harness a clean and renewable energy source.\nHistory.\nSwirl.\nWater wheels have been used for thousands of years for industrial power. Their main shortcoming is size, which limits the flow rate and head that can be used.\nThe migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years. Development occurred during the Industrial revolution, using scientific principles and methods. They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time.\nThe word turbine was coined by the French engineer Claude Bourdin in the early 19th century and is derived from the Latin word for \"whirling\" or a \"vortex\". The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor. This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power. They could process more water by spinning faster and could use much greater heads. (Later, impulse turbines were developed which did not use swirl).\nTime line.\nJ\u00e1n Andrej Segner developed a reactive water turbine in the mid-1700s. It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines. It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites. Segner worked with Euler on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design.\nIn 1820, Jean-Victor Poncelet developed an inward-flow turbine.\nIn 1826 Benoit Fourneyron developed an outward-flow turbine. This was an efficient machine (~80%) that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension. The stationary outlet also had curved guides.\nIn 1844 Uriah A. Boyden developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine. Its runner shape was similar to that of a Francis turbine.\nIn 1849, James B. Francis improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90% efficiency. He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design. The Francis turbine, named for him, is the first modern water turbine. It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today. \nInward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design. Also, as the swirling mass of water spins into a tighter rotation, it tries to speed up to conserve energy. This property acts on the runner, in addition to the water's falling weight and swirling motion. Water pressure decreases to zero as it passes through the turbine blades and gives up its energy.\nAround 1890, the modern fluid bearing was invented, now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles. As of 2002, fluid bearings appear to have a mean time between failures of more than 1300 years.\nAround 1913, Victor Kaplan created the Kaplan turbine, a propeller-type machine. It was an evolution of the Francis turbine but revolutionized the ability to develop low-head hydro sites.\nA new concept.\nAll common water machines until the late 19th century (including water wheels) were reaction machines; water's \"pressure\" head acted on the machine and produced work. A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer.\nIn 1866, California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that worked off a completely different concept. Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields, Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet, which had converted a high head (hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or penstock) of water to kinetic energy. This is called an impulse or tangential turbine. The water's velocity, roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery, does a u-turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at 0 velocity.\nIn 1879, Lester Pelton, experimenting with a Knight Wheel, developed a double bucket design, which exhausted the water to the side, eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel. In about 1895, William Doble improved on Pelton's half-cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry. This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92% efficiency. Pelton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although Doble took over the Pelton company he did not change the name to Doble because it had brand name recognition.\nTurgo and Crossflow turbines were later impulse designs.\nTheory of operation.\nFlowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner, creating a force on the blades. Since the runner is spinning, the force acts through a distance (force acting through a distance is the definition of work). In this way, energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine.\nWater turbines are divided into two groups; reaction turbines and impulse turbines.\nReaction turbines.\nReaction turbines are acted on by water, which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy. They must be encased to contain the water pressure (or suction), or they must be fully submerged in the water flow.\nNewton's Third Law of Motion describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.\nMost water turbines in use are reaction turbines. They are used in low and medium head applications.\nImpulse turbines.\nImpulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet. The jet pushes the turbine's curved blades which reverse the flow. The resulting change in momentum (impulse) causes a force on the turbine blades. Since the turbine is spinning, the force acts through a distance (work) and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy.\nPrior to hitting the turbine blades, the water's pressure (potential energy) is converted to kinetic energy by a nozzle and focused on the turbine. No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades, and the turbine does not require a housing for operation.\nNewton's Second Law of Motion describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.\nImpulse turbines are most often used in very high head applications.\nPower.\nThe power available in a stream of water is;\nformula_1\nwhere:\nPumped storage.\nSome water turbines are designed for Pumped storage hydroelectricity. They can reverse flow and operate as a pump to fill a high reservoir during off-peak electrical hours, and then revert to a turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand. This type of turbine is usually a Deriaz or Francis in design.\nEfficiency.\nLarge modern water turbines operate at mechanical efficiencies greater than 90% (not to be confused with thermodynamic efficiency).\nTypes of water turbines.\nReaction turbines:\nImpulse turbines:\nDesign and application.\nTurbine selection is based mostly on the available water head, and less so on the available flow rate. In general, impulse turbines are used for high head sites, and reaction turbines are used for low head sites. Kaplan turbines are well-adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions, since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions.\nSmall turbines (mostly under 10 MW) may have horizontal shafts, and even fairly large bulb-type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal. Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head, and makes installation of a generator more economical. Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head. Some impulse turbines use multiple water jets per runner to increase specific speed and balance shaft thrust.\nMaintenance.\nTurbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements; overhaul intervals are on the order of several years. Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal, inspection, and repair of worn parts.\nNormal wear and tear is pitting from cavitation, fatigue cracking, and abrasion from suspended solids in the water. Steel elements are repaired by welding, usually with stainless steel rod. Damage areas are cut or ground out, then welding back up to their original or an improved profile. Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime. Elaborate welding procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs.\nOther elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include bearings, packing box and shaft sleeves, servomotors, cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils, seal rings, wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces.\nEnvironmental impact.\nWater turbines have had both positive and negative impacts on the environment.\nThey are one of the cleanest producers of power, replacing the burning of fossil fuels and eliminating nuclear waste. Burning fossil fuels produces smoke and ash, and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide. Nuclear waste emits dangerous radiation and is difficult to dispose of. They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades. They produce significant amounts of the world's electrical supply.\nHistorically there have also been negative consequences. The rotating blades or gated runners of water turbines can interrupt the natural ecology of rivers, killing fish, stopping migrations, and disrupting peoples' livelihoods. For example, American Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest had livelihoods built around salmon fishing, but aggressive dam-building destroyed their way of life. Since the late 20th century, it has been possible to construct hydropower systems that divert fish and other organisms away from turbine intakes without significant damage or loss of power; such systems require less cleaning but are substantially more expensive to construct. In the United States, it is now illegal to block the migration of fish so fish ladders must be provided by dam builders."}

It is different from fossil fuels as it does not produce as many greenhouse gases and other pollutants as fossil fuel combustion.\nPeople have used traditional wind power, hydropower, biofuel, and solar energy for many centuries, all around the world. The mass production of electricity using renewable energy sources is now becoming more common. \nGrowth of renewables.\nFrom the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10\u201360% annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies, growth sped up in 2009 relative to the previous four years. More wind power was added during 2009 than any other renewable technology. However, grid-connected PV increased the fastest of all renewables technologies, with a 60% annual average growth rate. \nProjections vary, but scientists have advanced a plan to power 100% of the world's energy with wind, hydroelectric, and solar power by the year 2030.\nWind power market grows.\nWind power capacity has expanded quickly to 336 GW in June 2014, and wind energy production was about 4% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing fast. Wind power is widely used in European countries, and more recently in the United States and Asia. Wind power accounts for approximately 19% of electricity generation in Denmark, 11% in Spain and Portugal, and 9% in the Republic of Ireland. These are some of the largest wind farms in the world, as of January 2010: \nA wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used for production of electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.\nWorld's largest PV power plants.\nSolar photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity and many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built, mainly in Europe. As of December 2010, the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are the Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant (Canada, 97 MW), Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station (Italy, 84.2 MW), Finsterwalde Solar Park (Germany, 80.7 MW), Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant (Italy, 70 MW), Olmedilla Photovoltaic Park (Spain, 60\u00a0MW), the Strasskirchen Solar Park (Germany, 54\u00a0MW), and the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park (Germany, 53\u00a0MW). Larger power stations are under construction, some proposed will have a capacity of 150\u00a0MW or more.\nMany of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.\nNew generation of solar thermal plants.\nLarge solar thermal power stations include the 354\u00a0megawatt (MW) Solar Energy Generating Systems power installation in the USA, Solnova Solar Power Station (Spain, 150\u00a0MW), Andasol solar power station (Spain, 100\u00a0MW), Nevada Solar One (USA, 64\u00a0MW), PS20 solar power tower (Spain, 20\u00a0MW), and the PS10 solar power tower (Spain, 11\u00a0MW). The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world\u2019s largest solar thermal power plant project currently under construction.\nThe solar thermal power industry is growing fast with 1.2\u00a0GW under construction as of April 2009 and another 13.9\u00a0GW announced globally through 2014. Spain is the epicenter of solar thermal power development with 22\u00a0projects for 1,037\u00a0MW under construction, all of which are projected to come online by the end of 2010. In the United States, 5,600\u00a0MW of solar thermal power projects have been announced. In developing countries, three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in Egypt, Mexico, and Morocco have been approved.\nVariable renewable energy.\nVariable renewable energy is a renewable energy source that is non-dispatchable due to its fluctuating nature, like wind power and solar power, as opposed to a controllable renewable energy source such as hydroelectricity, or biomass, or a relatively constant source such as geothermal power or run-of-the-river hydroelectricity. Critics of wind and solar power warn of their variable output, but many studies have shown that the grid can cope, and it is doing so in Denmark and Spain.\nThe International Energy Agency says that there has been too much focus on issue of the variability. Its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant, and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management.\nEthanol for transportation.\nBrazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result, Brazil, which years ago had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in oil. \nMost cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and General Motors Corporation are among the automobile companies that sell \u201cflexible-fuel\u201d cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2006, there were approximately six million E85-compatible vehicles on U.S. roads."}

It is between Kazakhstan in the north and Karakalpakstan, an autonomous region of Uzbekistan, in the south.\nSince the 1960s, the Aral Sea shrank. 90% of the sea has gone. The rivers that fed it (the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya) were used by the Soviet Union for irrigating cotton production. What is left of the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, largely as the result of weapons testing, industrial projects, and fertilizer runoff before and after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nThere is a project to save at least the northern part of the Aral Sea. For this, a dam was built in the 1990 to stop water running off. Climate improved in the following years, and water levels rose again. However, that dam broke, and was rebuilt in 2005, with international funding.\nAnother problem was that the Island of Rebirth had been used for the testing of biological weapons until 1993. It is currently contaminated with anthrax, the plague, and tularemia. Since 2001, it is no longer an island, but a peninsula."}

Originally, radiation waves do not contain particles as they are transferred to Earth by the Sun for example.\nElectromagnetic radiation.\nMany people are already familiar with electromagnetic radiation (EMR), including light. The electromagnetic spectrum shows the types of radiation according to their wavelength and frequency. Some kinds are:\nDanger from radiation.\nIonizing radiation is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules.\nOnly certain types of radiation are harmful to humans. For example, ultraviolet radiation can give people sunburns. X-rays and gamma rays can make a person sick, or even die, depending on the dose they get. Some types of particle radiation can also make people sick and lead to burns. If radiation does not carry high enough levels of energy, though, then these changes will not happen when something is hit by the radiation. This is referred to as non-ionizing radiation, which is not as dangerous.\nOne can distinguish between various types of radiation by looking at the source of the radiation, its wavelength (if the radiation is electromagnetic), the amount of energy being carried, any particles involved, etc. Radioactive material is a material which emits radiation. Uranium and plutonium are examples of radioactive materials. The atoms they are made of tend to fall apart and give off different kinds of radiation, like gamma rays and lots of particle radiation.\nIonizing radiation by type.\nIonizing radiation can kill living things. It can cause genetic mutations, as shown by H.J. Muller. It can destroy cells in the body which divide, and thus indirectly kill a person."}

Visible light, near ultraviolet, infrared, microwave and radio waves are all examples of non-ionizing radiation, though visible and near ultraviolet can also ionize some molecules. The light from the Sun that reaches the earth is largely composed of non-ionizing radiation, with the notable exception of some ultraviolet rays.

Electromagnetic radiation can be divided into octaves \u2014 as sound waves are \u2014 adding up to eighty-one octaves. Physicists have studied electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from thousands of kilometres down to fractions of the size of an atom. It is commonly said that EM waves beyond these limits are uncommon, although this is not known to be true. The short wavelength limit is likely to be the Planck length, and the long-wavelength limit is the size of the universe itself, though in principle the spectrum is infinite. \nRadiation of shorter wavelength than about 30 \u03bcm is commonly detected by its ability to exceed the ionization energy of atoms. Radiation of longer than 3mm is commonly detected by its ability to induce electrical currents. Radiation between these limits was little used until the 21st century because of the difficulty of detecting it. \nSpectra of objects.\nNearly all objects in the universe emit, reflect or transmit some light. (Black holes do not.) The distribution of this light along the electromagnetic spectrum (called the \"spectrum\" of the object) is determined by what the object is made of.

He studied literature and philosophy at the Heidelberg university.\nHe was a close friend of Adolf Hitler. Goebbels stayed with Hitler in the F\u00fchrerbunker until Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945. After Hitler's death, Goebbels was chancellor of Germany for one day, before he and his wife Magda Goebbels killed themselves. Just before she died, Magda killed their six children with poison.\nEarly life.\nJoseph Goebbels was born as \"Paul Joseph Goebbels\" in M\u00f6nchengladbach on 29 October 1897. His father, Friedrich Goebbels, was a bookkeeper and his mother was Maria Goebbels (born Oldenhausen). He was the third child of the family and grew up with five siblings. Due to an illness in his childhood in 1901, Goebbels' right foot was malformed and he was . He went to a Roman Catholic school in Rheydt in 1908. In 1914, Goebbels went to high school in Rheydt. When the First World War started in August 1914, he volunteered to be part of the Army. This was refused because of his limp.\nGoebbels took his Abitur (school exams) in 1917. He was the best in his class. He gave a speech at the end of the school year. However, his headteacher said, that he would not become a good speaker. Later, in 1917, Goebbels studied ancient philology, history and German philology at the University of Bonn. He received his PhD in Drama from the Heidelberg university in 1921. In 1923, Goebbels worked for the Deutsche Bank.\nInvolvement in the Nazi Party.\nGoebbels joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party in 1926. In the same year, Hitler made him a Gauleiter for Berlin and Brandenburg. In 1927, Goebbels published the first Nazi newspaper, \"Der Angriff\" (\"The Attack\"), in Berlin. The newspaper was printed twice a week. In 1928, he became a member of the German Reichstag. He kept this position until 1945. In 1929, Goebbels saw his first movie with sound, \"The Singing Fool\". He said it would be the future of propaganda.\nIn 1930, he became the \"Reichspropagandaleiter\" (\"Chief of the German Propaganda\") and the deputy of Heinrich Himmler. Goebbels married Magda Quand in 1931. Franz Ritter von Epp and Adolf Hitler were the witnesses at the wedding.\nWhen Hitler became Chancellor in 1933, Goebbels became the Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.\nThe Nazi regime.\nPre-World War time.\nIn 1934, Goebbels moved to a villa near Berlin. On 30 June 1934, he saw the arrest of Ernst R\u00f6hm in Bad Wiessee. Goebbels gave the order to confiscate about 650 art exhibits in 1937. He put them on display in show called \"Degenerate Art\". On 9 November 1938, a German diplomat was killed in France by a Jewish teenager. Because of this murder, Goebbels gave the order to the SS for what is now called Kristallnacht.\nSecond World War.\nAt the start of the Second World War, Goebbels ordered to broadcast special announcements at the cinema and on the radio. On 26 May 1940, he published the new weekly newspaper \"Das Reich\" (\"The Imperium\") for the first time. In 1942, Goebbels took part in the Wannsee Conference. He was one of the Nazi leaders who planned the Final Solution to kill all the Jewish people. In 1943, he gave a well known speech in the Berlin Sportpalast where he called the Germans to support total war. The coup on 20 July 1944 failed, because of Goebbels' quick thinking. He broadcast on radio that the coup had failed, before the plan of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg could succeed.\nOn 22 April 1945, two days after Adolf Hitler's birthday, he arrived in the F\u00fchrerbunker in Berlin. He was one of the witnesses to the marriage of Hitler to Eva Braun. On the same day, he took over the leadership from Hitler. After Hitler's suicide on 30 April, he became the Chancellor of Germany. He only held this job for one day, because on 1 May 1945, his wife poisoned their six children with the help of an SS doctor. Immediately afterward he and his wife went up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they killed themselves. The details of their suicides are uncertain. After the war, Rear-Admiral Michael Musmanno, a U.S. naval officer and judge, published several accounts apparently based on eye-witness testimony: According to one account. \"While Schw\u00e4germann was preparing the petrol, he heard a shot. Goebbels had shot himself and his wife took poison. Schw\u00e4germann ordered one of the soldiers to shoot Goebbels again because he was unable to do it himself.\" One SS officer said they each took cyanide and ordered an SS trooper to shoot them both. According to another account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself."}

He wrote many operas, of which \"Der Freisch\u00fctz\", \"Euryanthe\" and \"Oberon\" are especially famous. He wrote instrumental music, especially for the clarinet, and wrote very well for orchestra.\nEarly life.\nWeber was the eldest of the three children of Franz Anton von Weber. The word \u201cvon\u201d in front of a German surname normally means that the family had noble ancestry, but the Weber family do not appear to be of noble blood. Weber was never a strong, healthy child. He had a damaged hip-bone and always walked with a limp. His father worked in the theatre, and the family often moved from one town to another. This was difficult for his education. His mother was called Rosa, she influenced him to go to military school at the age of 20, but his love for music meant that he would go to Cranbrook in Germany. His daughter Laurel was well known for playing the viola in many Orchestras.\nWeber\u2019s mother died of tuberculosis when he was eleven. Later that year Weber went to Salzburg, to study with Michael Haydn (the brother of the famous Joseph Haydn), and later to Munich. He started to publish some piano music, and even composed an opera. When he was 14 the family moved to Freiberg in Saxony. He had an opera performed there, and he started to write articles as a critic in a Leipzig newspaper.\nIn 1801 the family went back to Salzburg and Weber had more lessons from Michael Haydn. He also studied in Vienna with a famous musician called Abb\u00e9 Vogler. Through him he got to know another of his pupils, Giacomo Meyerbeer, who became a famous composer and was a close friend of Weber.\nSuccess.\nVogler thought Weber was very talented, and helped him to get a job in Breslau. Weber had lots of good ideas about how to improve the music there: by changing the way that the orchestra sat, having more rehearsal time, not playing bad pieces of music, and pensioning off old singers. A lot of people there did not like these ideas and made life difficult for him. One night he absent-mindedly drank from a wine bottle. The bottle had engraving-acid inside, and it made him ill for two months. He was never able to sing again. When he tried to go back to work all the good changes he had made had been undone, so he resigned. He had a job in Karlsruhe for a short time, then went briefly back to Breslau, but because he owed people money there he disappeared and got a job in Stuttgart.\nHis lifestyle was rather wild, and he even got arrested once for debt and fraud. However, he continued to become well known as a composer and wrote a lot of instrumental and religious music. He spent some time in several large cities including Prague and Berlin. In Dresden he worked hard to make German Opera a success (most operas were still Italian in those days).\nWeber was not well. He was suffering from tuberculosis, but needed money to support his family. So when he was invited to go to London to compose and produce his opera \"Oberon\" he accepted the offer. He had already been having English lessons and learned to speak the language quite well. In 1826 he travelled to England where he finished composing \"Oberon\" and conducted its first performance on 12 April. He stayed on in England to earn some more money. He was looking forward to going home, but on 5 June, the night before he was due to go back to Germany, he died. He was buried in London. 18 years later Richard Wagner arranged for Weber\u2019s body to be brought back to Germany to be buried in Dresden.\nWeber left an opera \"Die Drei Pintos\" ('The Three Pintos') unfinished. Meyerbeer was going to finish it, but in the end it was Gustav Mahler who finished it and conducted the first performance of the completed work in Leipzig in 1888.\nHis music.\nWeber was not only a great composer, but a very skilled pianist and conductor. He wrote a very large number of works including cantatas and songs, but most of these are not often heard today. One of his most popular works is called \"Invitation to the Dance\". It was written for piano, but later Hector Berlioz arranged it for orchestra and this is how it is often heard nowadays.\nWeber wrote two Concertos for clarinet and orchestra and also a Concertino (a small concerto in one movement). Another one-movement concerto was the \"Konzertst\u00fcck in F minor\" for piano and orchestra. His opera \"Der Freisch\u00fctz \" is probably his best work, and the overture is often heard separately as a concert piece. The story of the opera is full of magic. It is written in German and has some spoken words as well as sung music (this kind of opera was called a Singspiel). This opera in particular influenced Richard Wagner who developed German opera in the 19th century."}

He also belonged to the Russian nobility. He married a Greek duchess named Sofia. They had two sons together: Duke Anton Aleksandrovich (around 1891\u20131950) and Duke Bagrat Aleksandrovich (1892\u20131981).\nDuring the revolution in Petrograd in 1917, Duke Aleksandr and his wife were killed by the Bolsheviks. Their two sons then escaped from Petrograd and went to the Caucasus. Bagrat was separated from his brother Anton.\nAnton later appeared in the city Rostov on Don. He married Barinova Elena Aleksandrovna. They had no children.\nBagrat got married to Elizaveta Danilovna in 1923. They had a daughter and a son together: Emma Bagratovna (1924\u20132005) and Yuri Bagratovich. Bagrat divorced Elizaveta in 1927. In the year 1932, Bagrat married Petrachuk Olga Alekseevna, the daughter of merchant from Ukraine. They had two daughters together: Amalia Bagratovn (born 1933) and Inessa Bagratovna (born 1936). Bagrat was an officer in the Imperial Army. He was awarded the Military Order of the Saint Grand Martyr and the Triumphant George. It was one of the highest awards of the Russian Empire.\nThe Ter Hachatrjan family fell under the repression of NKVD in 1937. They were arrested and placed in jail in the city of Goris. Bagrat Aleksandrovich was accused of taking part in the execution of 26 Baku Commissars. As was the case with all noble families, Duke Bagrat was found guilty of treason and was declared an enemy of the Soviet State. Under the pressure of the government, Duke Bagrat had to stop using his title and rid himself of all his possessions that were brought from Petrograd. The family were then given amnesty.\nAfter, that Bagrat Aleksandrovich worked as a director and actor of movies in Armenia. He died in Kafan in 1981.\nAmalia Bagratovna married Saidoff N. S., a rich man from Baku. They had two children together: Saidoff A. N. (born 1961) and Saidoff S. C. N.

He was originally an Armenian nobleman, descendant of South or Sout-West branch, i.e. Tarawn-Aldznik branch of Bagratouni or Bagratids dynasty (Actually son of the Armenian priest of Khachatur and, who was a descendant of the Armenian princely dynasty Bagratid, the south or south-west branch of them in 13-14 centuries saved shallow possessions in the district of Sassun or Sason of Western Armenia and province of Aldznik, as well as in the district of Mush in the province of Tarawn of Western Armenia). As a result of the hard oppressions of Kurd feudal lords, Daniel-Bek of Sassun transmigrated from Sason to the town Mush, where his family had a house in the Armenian quarter of Berd, near the church Saint Marineh. The eldest son of Daniel-Bek of Sassun, Avdal bek Ter-Khachatryants (1805-1867) also lived in Mush.

Electric power is a measurement of the rate at which energy is used over a period of time. The SI unit for power is the watt, the unit for energy is the joule, and the unit for time is the second. \nFor a direct current circuit, electric power equals the electric current multiplied by the voltage. \nWhen electric current flows through a circuit, it is slowed down by the resistance in the circuit. Devices can convert this current to useful forms of work, such as heat radiation, light emission, mechanical motion, or acoustic vibrations."}

Motion is a requirement of work. \nLike energy, it is a scalar quantity, with SI units of joules. Heat conduction is not considered to be a form of work, since there is no macroscopically measurable force, only microscopic forces occurring in atomic collisions. The term \"work\" was created in the 1830s by the French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis.\nAccording to the work-energy theorem if an external force acts upon a rigid object, causing its kinetic energy to change from \"Ek1\" to \"Ek2\", then the mechanical work (\"W\") is given by:\nwhere \"m\" is the mass of the object and \"v\" is the object's velocity.\nIf a constant force \"F\" acts on an object while the object is displaced a distance \"d\", and the force and displacement are parallel to each other, the work done on the object is the product of \"F\" and \"d\":\nIf the force and the displacement are in the same direction, the work is positive. If the force and the displacement are in opposite directions the work is negative. For example, the work done by the weight on a book being lifted is negative. This is because the downward weight is in the opposite direction to the upward displacement."}

It consists of two parts; pants and a bra top, leaving an uncovered area between the two. The bikini is an ancient invention, reinvented after the Second World War.\nThe bikini is perhaps the most popular female beachwear around the globe.\nBy the mid 2000s bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, according to the NPD Group, a consumer and retail information company. The bikini has boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning industries.\nHistory.\nPredecessors of the bikini date back to antiquity, in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck and the Greco-Roman world. Artwork dating back to the Diocletian period (286-305\u00a0AD) in Villa Romana del Casale, Sicily depicts women in garments resembling bikinis in mosaics on the floor. The images of ten women, dubbed the \"Bikini Girls\", exercising in clothing that would pass as bikinis today, are the most replicated mosaic among the 37 million colored tiles at the site. Archeological finds, especially in Pompeii, show the Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini. A statue of Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere; others were found in the front hall.\nBy the early 1940s two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear.\nThe modern bikini was introduced by French engineer Louis R\u00e9ard and fashion designer Jacques Heim in Paris in 1946. R\u00e9ard was a car engineer but by 1946 he was running his mother's lingerie boutique near Les Folies Berg\u00e8res in Paris. Heim was working on a new kind of beach costume. It comprised two pieces, the bottom large enough to cover its wearer's navel. R\u00e9ard named his swimsuit the \"bikini\", taking the name from the Bikini Atoll, one of a series of islands in the South Pacific where testing on the new atomic bomb was occurring that summer. R\u00e9ard could not find a model to wear his design. He ended up hiring Micheline Bernardini, a nude dancer from the \"Casino de Paris\". That bikini, with a g-string back, had of cloth with newspaper type printed across. It introduced on July 5 at Piscine Molitor, a public pool in Paris. Heim's design was the first worn on the beach, but the clothing was given its name by R\u00e9ard. The bikini became increasingly popular throughout the 1960s and 70s."}

{"id": "56027", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56027", "title": "Jimi Hendrix", "text": "James Marshall Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 \u2013 September 18, 1970), was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Hendrix was a major influence on other rock and roll musicians.\nInitially gaining recognition in England, Hendrix became famous throughout the world after appearances at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, at which he purposely set his guitar on fire, and Woodstock Festival.\nA self-taught musician, unable to read or write music notation, he famously played a right-handed Fender Stratocaster guitar turned over and restrung to play left-handed. Jimi Hendrix was named \"Greatest Guitarist of all Time\" by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in 2003.\nEarly life.\nJimi Hendrix was born in Seattle on November 27, 1942. He was called Johnny Allen Hendrix when he was born. Later, his dad named him James Marshall Hendrix when he returned from the military. He grew up without much money or attention; his parents divorced when he was nine years old, and his mother died when he was 16. At about the age of 14, Hendrix found his first guitar. It was a broken broomstick with one string that had been thrown away by another boy. He still managed to play several tunes on it. Soon after, at around 15, he managed to buy a proper acoustic guitar for $5 from a friend of his father. His first electric guitar was a white Supro Ozark that his father, Al Hendrix, had bought him. He did not have lessons and learned basic tunes and improvisation from watching Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley play live. He played without an amplifier.\nSchool.\nHendrix finished middle school but did not graduate from his high school, Garfield High School. Hendrix told some reporters in the late 1960s that he had failed because people were racist there, and did not like him because he was black. Others claim it was just because he could not get good enough grades and was unorganized. Hendrix later told the reporters that he was thrown out for being rude to a teacher.\nEarly inspirations.\nWhen Hendrix was young, he was a fan of Elvis Presley. He went to see Presley play at Sick\u2019s Stadium on September 1, 1957, and he drew a color picture of him holding an acoustic guitar. The original drawing can be seen in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Even as an adult, he still loved Presley. He went to a see a Presley movie, King Creole, in Paris in late 1968, to give him inspiration to write songs. He also liked famous blues musicians such as Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and Lightning Hopkins; and he played in the band of R&amp;B star Little Richard. However, Hendrix and Richard did not get along. Richard did not like Hendrix's clothes, his being late and him showing off on stage.\nThe army.\nAfter getting in trouble for stealing cars twice, Hendrix had to choose between going to prison for two years or joining the U.S. Army. Hendrix chose the army and on May 31, 1961 was sent to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. While in the army, his officers said that he was often caught sleeping on duty and needed to be watched at all times. He could not use a gun well and an officer said that \"his mind apparently cannot function [cannot work properly] while performing duties and thinking about his guitar\". However, his time in the army was important for Hendrix, because it was there that he met another soldier and bass guitar player called Billy Cox. They would later play together in a small group called The King Kasuals.\nOn May 31, 1962 Hendrix\u2019s officers thought it would be best for him to leave the army because he caused too much trouble. Hendrix agreed, and he left after only a year of service. Hendrix later said he had been let go from the army after breaking his ankle when he was landing his 26th parachute jump. He also spoke about his time in the army in interviews for a magazine, \"Melody Maker\", in 1967 and 1969. He said that he did not like serving the army and did not agree with their ways of doing things. When he was interviewed in America, Hendrix never talked about his time in the army. When it was brought up in a television interview, Hendrix only said that he had been based at Fort Campbell.\nLater life.\nHendrix's left-handed playing on a guitar made for right-handed people made him popular. His first proper concert was with a small band without a name, playing in a Synagogue. He later joined a band called The Velvetones.\nAfter leaving the army, Hendrix and Cox moved to Clarksville in Tennessee, where they played in their group, The King Kasuals. They played in small bars but they did not make much money. So, eventually, he and Cox moved to Nashville. They played many blues-style songs in Nashville. In November 1962, Hendrix went to his first studio performance. While in Nashville, Hendrix played in many other bands as rhythm and lead guitarist and vocals. This did not get him much money, but did give him experience of how bands worked.\nLater, Hendrix left Nashville and went to Northern New York City. By January 1964, he moved to Harlem where he played at bars and clubs for money. Hendrix also won first prize in an amateur guitar contest at The Apollo Theatre. In 1966, Hendrix formed his own band called \"Jimmy James and The Blues Flames\" one of the members of the band was Little Ritchard. The members were people that he met around town. One of them was a 15-year-old boy called Randy. \nHendrix played many gigs around New York City and many songs at a cafe called \"Caf\u00e9 Wha?\"\nIn 1966, Hendrix became friends with the girlfriend of Keith Richards, guitarist for The Rolling Stones, Linda Keith. She liked his music and introduced him to Chas Chandler, the manager for The Animals. Chandler told Hendrix to write a rock version of the song \u201cHey Joe\u201d and when he did, Chandler brought him to London to sign a contract with him. Hendrix had to make a new band. It was called The Jimi Hendrix Experience with Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, a name found by their business manager Mike Jeffery.\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience.\n\"Are You Experienced?\".\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience made its first album in 1967. It was called Are You Experienced? \nWhen the album was being produced and sold, Hendrix travelled around the UK and some of Europe. On June 4, 1967, The Jimi Hendrix Experience played their last concert in London before going to America. In America many famous people came to see Hendrix play including Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Brian Epstein.\nThe album reached number two in the UK charts. In 2001, VH1 named \"Are You Experienced\" as the fifth greatest album of all time. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine put it at number 15 on a list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003.\n\"Axis: Bold as Love\".\nHendrix\u2019 second album came out in 1967. It was called Axis: Bold as Love. It had famous songs in it, most famous being \"Little Wing\". There have been several other versions of the song by other musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Henry \"Hank\" Marrion, Metallica, Eric Clapton, Sting and Pearl Jam. An important difference in the album from other albums he made was that Hendrix tuned his guitar down a semi-tone (to E flat). The album reached number three in the US charts and number five in the UK charts.\nThe album almost did not sell, since Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP in the back of a taxi in London. Hendrix, Chas Chandler and an engineer called Eddie Kramer had to re-mix the songs in one night. They could not get the song \"If 6 was 9\" right, but Hendrix's bassist Noel Redding had a copy of it on tape. When the album was released, Hendrix was disappointed that the album was finished so quickly and he thought it could have been done better.\n\"Electric LadyLand\".\nHendrix finished his third album, called Electric LadyLand - a double album with two LP's - in 1968. In this year, Chas Chandler (Hendrix\u2019s manager) decided to leave Hendrix and so did Noel Redding. When Chandler left, Hendrix changed everything in his music. He began using different musicians and instruments. He used guitars with flutes and trombones all with distortion to get strange sounds. The album reached number one in the US. It reached number five in the UK. In 2003, VH1 named the album the 72nd best album of all time, and the \"Rolling Stones\" magazine gave it 54th greatest album of all time.\nWoodstock.\nHendrix went to play at Woodstock on August 18, 1969. That year, Woodstock made over $18,000 and has since become one of the most famous concerts in the world. Hendrix was told to play on Sunday evening, but did not arrive until Monday morning, which was unfortunate because of the 500,000 people that had paid to see him, around 180,000 were left and did not plan on staying his whole concert; they just wanted to see him in person for a few minutes. Hendrix then went on to play a two-hour concert that was described as awful. Hendrix\u2019s large band had not practiced enough and could not keep up with Hendrix's fast guitar playing. But to make up for all of this, Hendrix played a version of Star Spangled Banner. He played this anthem with heavy distortion and screams from his guitar, and people thought that he was being anti-American and making fun of their anthem and country. Hendrix, in an interview, said that he \"did not intend for his performance to be a political statement\", he just wanted it to be another version of the national anthem.\nDeath.\nOn September 18, 1970, Hendrix was found dead in a basement of the Samarkand Hotel in London. He died after drinking too much, and then taking too many sleeping pills. He vomited and choked on his vomit because he could not regain consciousness. There are many different theories about his death. His girlfriend, who was with him at the time that he died, said that he was alive when she put him in the back of the ambulance, but hospital records say that Hendrix had been dead for some time before the ambulance had reached him. Some people say that Hendrix was alive, but that the paramedics did not properly hold his head while he was unconscious so he choked on his own vomit. A sad poem that was found in Hendrix\u2019 apartment written by him made some think that he committed suicide.\nThe most likely explanation is that Hendrix just took too many sleeping pills while he was drunk, and then could not wake up as he vomited and choked as a result. There has been recent speculation that he may have been murdered by his manager.\nBurial.\nHendrix was buried in Renton, Washington in Greenwood Memorial Park on October 1, 1970. His headstone was wrong because it shows a picture of Hendrix playing a Stratocaster, but the Stratocaster is right-handed, Hendrix played left-handed. Because Hendrix had so many fans, people were worried that the crowds of people wanting to look at his grave would damage other graves, so Hendrix\u2019 father, Al Hendrix, had another memorial site built far from other graves. The memorial is a granite dome architecture, held up by three pillars and Hendrix is buried underneath. His autograph is at the foot of each pillar and a brass sundial is at the top of the dome. There is also a memorial statue of Hendrix playing a Stratocaster on the corner of Broadway and Pine in Seattle.\nPersonality.\nFashion.\nHendrix had unique fashion and a Bob Dylan-style haircut. He wore scarves, rings and brooches. In his early career, he wore a dark suit with a silk shirt. Later, he wore bright blue velvet suits, red suits and flared trousers. In 1967, he started to wear a cowboy-style hat he called \"The Westerner\". \nIn 1968, Hendrix started tying scarves to his legs and arms. In 1969, he wore his famous bandana.\nDrugs.\nHendrix was widely associated with the use of psychedelic drugs like LSD. He also smoked marijuana and drank alcohol. Hendrix would become angry and violent when he was drunk.\nHowever, no one knows if Hendrix took heroin. Hendrix died after choking on his own vomit in a London apartment. At his autopsy, there was no heroin in his body and he had no needle marks on his body."}

Often, it's jellied gasoline. Napalm is actually the thickener in such liquids. When it is mixed with gasoline, the thickener makes a sticky incendiary gel. It was developed by the U.S. in World War II by a team of Harvard chemists. The team leader was Louis Fieser. The name \"napalm\" has comes from the ingredients that were first used to make it: coprecipitated aluminum salts of naphthenic and palmitic acids. These were added to the flammable substance to cause it to gel.\nOne of the major problems of early incendiary fluids (such as those used in flamethrowers) was that they splashed and drained too easily. The U.S. found that flamethrowers that use a gasoline gel are able to shoot farther and are more useful. Gasoline gel was difficult to manufacture because it used natural rubber, which was in high demand and expensive. Napalm provided a far cheaper alternative. It solved the problems involved with rubber-based incendiaries.\nNowadays, napalm is mostly made of benzene and polystyrene, and is known as napalm-B.\nNapalm was used in flamethrowers and firebombs by the U.S. and allied forces. Napalm is made to burn at a specific rate and stick to materials. This is done by mixing different amounts of napalm and other materials. Another useful (and dangerous) effect, primarily involving its use in bombs, was that napalm \"rapidly deoxygenates the available air.\" It also creates large amounts of carbon monoxide causing suffocation. Napalm bombs were also used in the Vietnam War to clear landing zones for helicopters.\nThough napalm was a 20th-century invention, it is part of a long history of incendiary devices in warfare. However historically, it was primarily liquids that were used (see Greek fire). An infantry-based flammable liquid fuel weapon, the flamethrower was introduced in World War I by the Germans, variations of which were soon developed by other sides in the conflict.\nUsage in warfare.\nOn July 17, 1944, napalm bombs were dropped for the first time by American P-38 pilots on a fuel depot at Coutances, near St. L\u00f4, France. Napalm bombs were first used in the Pacific Theatre during the Battle of Tinian by Marine aviators. Its use was complicated by problems with mixing, fusing and the release mechanisms. In World War II, Allied forces bombed cities in Japan with napalm, and used it in bombs and flamethrowers in Germany and the Japanese-held islands. It was used by the Greek army against communist guerrilla fighters during the Greek Civil War, by United Nations forces in Korea, by Mexico in the late 1960s against guerrilla fighters in Guerrero and by the United States during the Vietnam War.\nThe most well-known method of delivering napalm is from air-dropped incendiary bombs. A lesser-known method is the flame throwers used by combat infantry. Flamethrowers use a thinner version of the same fuel to destroy gun emplacements, bunkers and cave hideouts. U.S. Marines fighting on Guadalcanal found them very effective against Japanese positions. The Marines used fire as both a casualty weapon as well as a psychological weapon. Men have a natural fear of fire. They found that Japanese soldiers would abandon positions in which they fought to the death against other weapons. Prisoners of war confirmed that they feared napalm more than any other weapon thrown at them.\nNapalm became one of the preferred weapons of the Korean War. Pilots returning from the war zone often remarked they would rather have a couple of gasoline tanks full of napalm to drop than any other weapon, bombs, rockets or guns. The U.S. Air Force and Navy used napalm with great effect against all manner of targets to include troops, tanks, buildings and even rail road tunnels. The demoralizing effect napalm had on the enemy became apparent when scores of North Korean troops began to surrender to aircraft flying overhead. Pilots noted they saw surviving enemy troops waving white flags on subsequent passes after dropping napalm. The pilots radioed to ground troops and the North Koreans were captured.\nNapalm has been used recently in wartime by or against: Iran (1980\u201388), Israel (1967, 1982), Nigeria (1969), Brazil (1972), Egypt (1973), Cyprus (1964, 1974), Argentina (1982), Iraq (1980\u201388, 1991, 20th March 2003 \u2013 15th December 2011), Serbia (1994), Turkey (1963, 1974, 1997), Angola, United States.\nIn some cases, napalm disables and kills its victims very quickly. Those who do survive suffer up to 5th degree burns. These damage parts of the skin which do not have pain receptors. However, victims who suffer 2nd degree burns from splashed napalm will be in significant amounts of pain.\nPhilip Jones Griffiths describes its use in Vietnam:\nPhuc had third-degree burns to half her body and was not expected to live. Thanks to assistance from South Vietnamese photographer Nick Ut, and after surviving a 14-month hospital stay and 17 operations, she became an outspoken peace activist.\nInternational law does not prohibit the use of napalm or other incendiaries against military targets, but use against civilian populations was banned by the United Nations' inhumane weapons convention (often referred to as the CCW) in 1981. Protocol III of the CCW restricts the use of incendiary weapons (not only napalm), but a number of states have not acceded to all of the protocols of the CCW. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), states are considered a party to the convention, which entered into force as international law in December 1983, if they ratify at least two of the five protocols. The United States, for example, is a party to the CCW but did not sign Protocol III.\nReports by the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" suggested that \"napalm\" has been used in the Iraq War by US forces. The U.S. Department of Defense denied this. In August 2003, the San Diego Union Tribune said that U.S. Marine pilots and their commanders confirmed the use of Mark 77 firebombs on Iraqi Republican Guards during the start of combat. Official denials of the use of 'napalm' were, however, disingenuous, as the Mk 77 bomb that is currently in service at this time, the Mk 77 Mod 5, does not use actual napalm (e.g. napalm-B). The last U.S. bomb to use actual napalm was the Mark 77 Mod 4, the last of which were destroyed in March 2001. The substance used now is a different incendiary mixture. It is sufficiently analogous in its effects that it is still a controversial incendiary, and can still be referred to colloquially as 'napalm.'\n\"We napalmed both those (bridge) approaches,\" said Col. Randolph Alles in a recent interview. \"Unfortunately, there were people there because you could see them in the (cockpit) video.\" (...) \"They were Iraqi soldiers there. It's no great way to die,\" he added. (...) The generals love napalm. ... It has a big psychological effect.\" - \"San Diego Union-Tribune, August 2003\"\nThese bombs did not actually have napalm in them. The napalm-B (super napalm) used in Vietnam was gasoline based. The Mk-77 firebombs used in the Gulf were kerosene based. It is, however, a napalm-like liquid in its effect.\nRecipes how to make napalm-like substances can be found on the Internet. Very often, the recipes say that they will make a thick substance using gasoline, with soap or polystyrene as a thickening agent. However, inexperienced people following these instructions often handle the substance improperly and cause accidents. In addition, making incendiary devices is illegal in many countries.\nComposition.\nNapalm is usually a mixture of gasoline with suitable thickening agents. The earliest thickeners were soaps, aluminum, and magnesium palmitates and stearates. Depending on how much thickener is added, the resulting viscosity may range between syrupy liquid and thick rubbery gel. The content of long hydrocarbon chains makes the material highly hydrophobic (resistant to wetting with water), making it more difficult to extinguish. Thickened fuel also rebounds better from surfaces, making it more useful for operations in urban terrain.\nThere are two types of napalm: oil-based with aluminium soap thickener, and oil-based with polymeric thickener (\"napalm-B\").\nThe United States military uses three kinds of thickeners: M1, M2, and M4.\nA later variant, napalm-B, also called \"super napalm\", is a mixture of low-octane gasoline with benzene and polystyrene. It was used in the Vietnam War. Unlike conventional napalm, which burns for only 15\u201330 seconds, napalm B burns for up to 10 minutes with fewer fireballs. It also sticks better to surfaces, and offers improved destruction effects. It is not as easy to ignite. This reduces the number of accidents caused by soldiers smoking. When it burns, it develops a characteristic smell.\nStarting in the early 1990s, various websites including The Anarchist Cookbook advertised recipes for homemade napalm. These recipes were predominantly equal parts gasoline and styrofoam. This mixture closely resembles that of napalm-B, but lacks a percentage of benzene.\nNapalm reaches burning temperatures of approximately 1,200\u00a0\u00b0C (2,200 \u00b0F). Other additives can be added, e.g. powdered aluminium or magnesium, or white phosphorus.\nIn the early 1950s, Norway developed its own napalm, based on fatty acids in whale oil. The reason for this development was that the American-produced thickening agent performed rather poorly in the cold Norwegian climate. The product was known as Northick II.\nIn popular culture.\nNapalm itself became well known by the American public after its use in the Vietnam war. Since then, it has been mentioned in the media and arts multiple times. This summary is not meant to be all inclusive."}

The Midwest is composed of Nebraska, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Michigan, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Oklahoma and Kentucky are occasionally considered Midwestern, but this definitely is questioned by scholars, whom refer to those regions, along with Missouri to be border states - those consisting of southern and Midwestern traits. The word \"Midwest\" has been in common use since the late 19th century. Other names for the area are no longer used. These names include the \"Northwest\" or \"Old Northwest\", \"Mid-America,\" or \"the Heartland\".\nGeography.\nThe land in the Midwest is generally thought of as consisting of rolling hills with some mountainous and flat regions like the Great Plains states. The far northern part of the Upper Mississippi valley is known as the , a region of very rugged hills centered primarily western Wisconsin, though the region includes small parts of northeast Iowa, Southeast Minnesota, and northwest Illinois. The of Wisconsin contain the highest peaks in the Driftless Region. Also, the northern part of the Ozark mountain range is in southern Missouri. Prairies cover most of the states west of the Mississippi River, with buttes, rugged rocky areas, and hills in western North Dakota and South Dakota ( and ), and the foothills of the Rockies in western Kansas and Nebraska. Less rain falls in the western Midwest than in the eastern part. This causes different types of prairies. Most of the Midwest can now be called either \"urban areas\" or \"agricultural areas\". Areas in northern Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin, and the Ohio River valley are not very developed.\nChicago is the largest city in the region, followed by Detroit and Indianapolis. Some other important cities in the region are: Minneapolis-St. Paul, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Columbus, Des Moines, and Madison.\nCulture.\nMidwesterners are sometimes viewed as open, friendly, and straightforward, or sometimes as stubborn and uncultured. People view the Midwest as a very open place with lots of corn and wheat, very dry crops and sometimes simple people. Midwest values were shaped by religious beliefs and the agricultural values from the people who settled in the area. The Midwest today is a mix of Protestantism and Calvinism, untrusting of authority and power. \nBetween 19 and 29% of the Midwest is Catholic. 14% of the people in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, 22% in Missouri and 5% in Minnesota are Baptists. 22-24% of people in Wisconsin and Minnesota are Lutherans. 1% or less of the people in the Midwest are Jewish and Muslim, with slightly more Jewish or Muslim people in major cities, such as Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland. 16% of the Midwest's population do not follow any religion.\nBecause of 20th century African American migration from the South, many African Americans live in most of the area's large cities. However, there are still more African Americans living in the Southern United States than in the Midwest. The mix of industry and cultures in those cities led to new types of music in the 20th century in the Midwest, including jazz, blues, rock and roll. Jazz was invented in New Orleans, but started to develop and grow in Kansas City. Techno music came from Detroit and house music and blues came from Chicago.\nToday the population of the Midwest is 65,971,974, or 22.2% of the total population of the United States.\nPolitics.\nPolitics in the Midwest is divided, although if you include Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and the Dakotas in it leans conservative. With some states leaning liberal and many others conservative. The Great Lakes area, which has more large cities than the rest of the Midwest, tends to be the most liberal area of the Midwest. However, the rural Great Plains states, are more conservative. Traditionally, the larger cities tend to lean to the left while those in the rural countryside lean farther right. \nUS Senate.\nAs of 2020, in the Senate, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota are each represented by 2 Democrats. Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are represented by 1 Democrat and 1 Republican each. The Dakotas, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska are all represented by 2 Republicans each. The final tally is 9 Democrats and 15 Republicans.\nState Legislatures.\nAs of 2020, Minnesota's is the only state legislature in the nation where 1 house is controlled by Republicans and the other by Democrats. Illinois\u00b4s is the only state legislature in the Midwest where both houses are controlled by Democrats; all the other states have Republican-controlled legislatures.\nAccents.\nThe accents of the Midwest are often clearly different from the accents of the South and many urban areas of the American Northeast. The accent of most of the Midwest is thought by many to be \"standard\" American English. Many national radio and television shows in the U.S. like this accent more than many other accents. This may have started because many television show hosts \u2014 such as Walter Cronkite, Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Tom Brokaw and Casey Kasem \u2014 came from this area.\nIn some parts of the Midwest, the accents are quite different from the \"neutral\" accent of the rest of the Midwest. These accents usually are because of the of the area. For example, Minnesota, western Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula have strong Scandinavian accents, which get stronger the farther north one goes. Many parts of Michigan have Dutch-flavored accents. Also, people from Chicago are known to have their own \"\" accent. The same is true of St. Louis. In the most southern parts of the Midwest, such as southern Indiana, Southern accents are common in addition to the standard Midwest accent. The same can be said of Southern Illinois, particularly below U.S. Highway 50 and south of St. Louis. Missouri is also an example of a Midwest state with southern culture. Missourians usually have either a Southern or Midwestern accent, or a combined dialect of both, but accents tend to be distinctly Southern in the Southeastern and Bootheel sections of the state."}

His mother is Judith and his father is Michael, who was a high school teacher. Keenan's parents divorced when he was three years old, and Michael moved away. Keenan did not see him very much for the next 12 years. Later, his mother married someone else. He was mean and did not allow Keenan to be creative. When Keenan was 11, his mother, Judith, had a brain aneurysm that paralyzed her. Two years later, she told Keenan to move to Michigan with his father.\nThe Army.\nKeenan joined the United States Army after he graduated from high school. He wanted to use the G.I. Bill to go to art school. He joined the United States Military Academy Preparatory School (West Point Prep School) where he picked up the nickname \"Maynard\". He did very well in his training, but said no to an offer to stay in the Army and work at West Point. He decided to start his music career instead.\nArt.\nAfter being honorably discharged from the Army, Keenan went back to Michigan to go to art school. Then, in 1988, he moved to Los Angeles, California to help design the inside of pet stores. He was fired from this job and then worked creating movie sets. He also played bass guitar in a band and sang for another band.\nMusic career.\nKeenan started playing soon after leaving art school. Then he and Adam Jones formed Tool. They have a thing for releasing albums every five years. They did so with Undertow, \u00c6nima, and 10,000 Days. Keenan left and formed A Perfect Circle. They had 3 albums, Mer De Noms, The Thirteenth Step, and eMOTIVe. He then left again to go and pursue family time. He now has a vineyard where he makes fine wine but still takes tours for his working side project; Puscifer... Tool's new album had officially set to release August 30th, 2019\nTool.\nKeenan met Adam Jones in Los Angeles. They started the band Tool in 1990. The band's line up later became Keenan as singer, Jones playing guitar, Danny Carey playing drums, and Paul D'Amour playing bass. When D'Amour left the band, Justin Chancellor took his place. Tool signed to Zoo Entertainment in November 1991."}

Wollstein. Anarcho-capitalists say that the government is a thief, because it takes people's money away against their will.\u00a0 They also say that governments also keep people from making trades between themselves.\nAnarcho-capitalism as a form of libertarianism.\nMost libertarians are minarchists, which means they think that there needs to be a very small government whose only purpose is to protect people's property.\u00a0 Anarcho-capitalists are different because they believe society would be better off without any government, even though they are still a kind of libertarian.\nAnarcho-capitalism and anarchism.\nIn general, anarcho-capitalism is not considered anarchism. However, like anarchists, anarcho-capitalists say they are against the whole idea of hierarchy.\u00a0 Anarcho-capitalists do not define hierarchy as something that exists when one person is simply \"seen\" as being more important than another person.\u00a0 Anarcho-capitalist believe hierarchy exists only when a person is given the authority to use force against a nonviolent person or that person's legitimate property.\u00a0 Only when \"no one\" is allowed to use force against nonviolent people or their legitimate property are people truly equal.\u00a0 They think that only then is hierarchy no more.\nAnarchists are against capitalism as they think it uses force. Anarcho-capitalists support capitalism and say everything in it is consensual.\nAnarchists oppose anarcho-capitalism because they do not believe any private property is legitimate.\u00a0 These anarchists would say that all property is founded on the theft of the commons (unowned land and stuff).\u00a0 Many anarchists don't even think that anarcho-capitalism counts as a real form of anarchism, as this critique of property goes back to some of the earliest people calling themselves anarchists.\nProperty.\nAnarcho-capitalists, like other libertarians and classical liberals, only believe property is legitimate when it has been gotten in the right sort of way.\u00a0 If you steal (take something from someone without their permission), or hire someone to steal on your behalf, or ask the government to steal on your behalf, the property you get is not really yours.\u00a0 The \"real\" owner is still the person or people it belonged to before it was stolen.\u00a0 Anarcho-capitalists say that governments do not legitimately own anything, since governments get all of their wealth through force, including taxation and counterfeiting. Because anarcho-capitalists support private property, they believe that a person can own a building or land without actually using it. They believe that these things can be protected by private security guards.\nIn the eyes of anarcho-capitalists, property can only be legitimately gotten in one of three ways.\u00a0 The first way is through John Locke's \"homestead principle,\" which means that something owned by no one \"becomes\" your legitimate property when you \"mix your labour\" with the thing.\u00a0 In other words, if you come across an unowned field, and you start farming it, then the land you farm becomes your property, along with all of the crops you grow.\u00a0 If someone else comes along and steals all of the crops you worked on growing, that person has committed a form of force called \"theft.\"\u00a0 The second and third ways to legitimately get property is through voluntary trade or gift.\nIf someone has gotten something in an illegitimate way, it is not theft to take the thing back, as long as you harm no innocent person in the process.\nNon-aggression.\nSome anarcho-capitalists are also anarcho-pacifists, but most anarcho-capitalists are not. Anarcho-pacifists, like Robert LeFevre, believe one may never use any force at all, not even in self-defence. Most anarcho-capitalists, however, believe it is okay to use defensive force as long as it is \"only\" directed against those who have used non-defensive force, and as long as it is proportional to the non-defensive force.\u00a0 In other words, one may not legitimately shoot a person for stealing a stick of gum, because shooting someone is a lot more forceful than stealing the gum."}

He was the greatest of the German Minnesinger. These were people who wrote and sang songs about courtly love. Walther himself may have added \u201cvon der Vogelweide\u201d to his name (it means \u201cof the bird meadow\u201d).\nThe German courtly love songs that had been written at the time were all very similar, but Walther gave these songs new life and made them very beautiful. Unfortunately we do not know any of his music, because he did not write it down. But he wrote his poems down. They are very original, sometimes humorous, sometimes serious, often just gently suggesting ideas carefully.\nWe do not know where Walther was born, but he wrote in a document that he had learned to sing and write poetry in Austria. The dialect he spoke shows that he must have come from Bavaria or Austria. He spent some time at the court of Duke Leopold V of Babenberg in Vienna. This was about 1190. He took part in public singing contests and had long discussions with other people about love and the way it should be written about in poetry.\nIn about 1198, he left Vienna and spent many years travelling around, visiting courts in Europe, entertaining dukes and princes, and singing his songs. He always wrote the words himself, he never used other poets\u2019 words. That would have made him a simple \u201cSpielmann\u201d, but Walther was of noble birth (he had the title \u201cHerr\u201d). He often spent several weeks or months in a castle where he entertained people, and where he probably also fell in love with one of the ladies. He wrote about these love-affairs in his poetry.\nWalther also wrote verses called \u201cSpr\u00fcche\" (\"sayings\"). These were about the history of the time. They were a kind of political propaganda and were used in political debates. Walther supported Emperor Otto IV in his arguments against the pope, persuading the emperor to go on the crusade which the pope had forbidden. We do not know whether Walther went with him on the crusade.\nBy this time Walther had became very famous, not just as a poet and musician but as a kind of political adviser. Walther was the first poet to write national and patriotic poetry. He also wrote a type of love poem which was new in German literature. \"Unter der Linde\" is the most famous of these. Here are the first two verses:"}

It is often included in the theatre form called burlesque. With music and dance, the stripper gradually removes her clothing. It is a very ancient dance form, and occurs in many societies.\nStripping is done in a teasing manner, but without being obscene (for example, by delaying to take an item off). While hiding certain parts of the body with hands or pieces of clothing, stripper dances around. Sometimes, plays are arranged, the strippers are disguised as Arabic dancers, Salome, Lolita or other well-known people. The spectator sometimes identifies with the stripper. Erotic dreams and exhibitionist fantasies may be projected into the striptease. \nAncient.\nSalome.\nThe Sumerians had a myth of the goddess Inanna descending into the Underworld. At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. When she returned, fecundity abounded. \nSalome's dance for King Herod is referred to in the New Testament ( and ). However, the first mention of her removing seven veils is in Oscar Wilde's play of \"Salome\" in 1893. Some have claimed as the origin of modern striptease. After Wilde's play and Richard Strauss's opera \"Salome\", first performed in 1905 the erotic 'dance of the seven veils', became a standard routine in opera, vaudeville, film and burlesque. A famous early practitioner was Maud Allan who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to Edward VII.\nGreece &amp; Rome.\nIn ancient Greece, the lawgiver Solon established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC. Among these were the \"auletrides\": female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men. In ancient Rome, dance featuring stripping was part of the Floralia, an April festival. \nEmpress Theodora, wife of 6th-century Byzantine emperor Justinian is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a courtesan and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed \"as far as the laws of the day allowed\". She was famous for her striptease performance of \"Leda and the Swan\". From these accounts, it appears that the practice was not exceptional or new. It was, however, actively opposed by the Christian Church, which got statutes banning it in the following century. The degree to which these statutes were enforced is open to question. No practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages.\nModern.\nParis.\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, Parisian shows such as the Moulin Rouge and Folies Berg\u00e8re had attractive scantily-clad women dancing and \"tableaux vivants\" (static poses). Acts in the 1890s had a woman slowly removed clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body. The \"People's Almanac\" credits this as the origin of modern striptease.\nStarting in 1905, Mata Hari entered the scene. On the invitation of Emile Guimet she danced before a carefully chosen audience. The scene at the end of the show, where she was naked was a sensation. Similar performances, at the requests of Baron von Rothschild, C\u00e9cile Sorel, Gaston Menier and Natalie Clifford Barney followed. Mata Hari had never learned how to dance, and had never studied Indian and oriental dancing. Her dances were a product of her imagination. In 1917, Mata Hari was charged with espionage and sentenced to death. She was shot, on 15 October 1917, in Vincennes, near Paris. \nAnother landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos who entered dressed only in three very small shells. In the 1930s the famous Josephine Baker danced semi-nude in the \"danse sauvage\" at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the Tabarin. These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. By the 1960s \"fully nude\" shows were provided at such places as Le Crazy Horse Saloon.\nPost WWII.\nAfter the war, in the 1950s striptease became the motor of an emerging sex industry (mainly focused on publications, like Playboy). Paris saw the opening of the high-society strip clubs, like the Alcazar or the Crazy Horse.\nIn modern times, the art of striptease gets lost more and more. In the 1990s, a German private TV channel (called RTL) made a strip show called Tutti Frutti. Since then, during the night, many TV stations have women, who try to get rid of their clothes (without even dancing), while they advertise some phone sex numbers (or other prime-rate numbers). \nThere is also a film called \"Striptease\". It plays in US strip clubs, without giving much background information.\nOriginally, striptease was only done by women. Today, a very small number of male strippers are there. Among the most notable of them are the Chippendales."}

The team has won the 1954 FIFA World Cup, 1974 FIFA World Cup, 1990 FIFA World Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup. The team came as second in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, 1982 FIFA World Cup, 1986 FIFA World Cup and in 2002 FIFA World Cup. In the 1934 FIFA World Cup, 1970 FIFA World Cup, 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup, the team got third place. The current coach is Joachim L\u00f6w and soon to be Hansi Flick.\nFrom 1950 to 1990, the team was mainly West Germany. Other teams were around that are now part of Germany. These include the East German team (1952-1990) and the Saarland team (1950-1956).\nGermany has always been one of the best teams in the world. Germany is the only team to have won men's and women's world cup titles. Also, Germany's main rivals are England, the Netherlands and Argentina.\nThe teams recent performance in a tournament was a victory over Argentina to win the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the semi-final against Brazil, Germany thrashed them with a 7\u20131 win, making it the largest win in FIFA World Cup semi-final history. Miroslav Klose, one of the greatest German players of all time, also scored a record breaking goal that made him the top scorer in FIFA World Cup history.\nRecent history.\nOliver Kahn and Michael Ballack era.\nAfter another World Cup exit in 1998, Germany's status as one of the best teams in the world was beginning to go away. In the UEFA Euro 2000, Germany failed to advance to the next round, after losing two matches and one draw in the group stage. The manager at the time then resigned and was replaced by Rudi V\u00f6ller.\nGoing into the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the expectations for Germany was low because of the mediocre performance in the qualifiers. However, they performed very well in the World Cup, eventually making it to the finals but losing to Brazil 0\u20132. Miroslav Klose of Germany won the Silver Boot and Oliver Kahn won the Golden Ball.\nGermany again failed to advance to the next round in the UEFA Euro 2004 after they tied two matches and lost one. The manager Rudi V\u00f6ller resigned shortly afterwards. J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann then replaced him, although having no experience. Joachim L\u00f6w was also assigned to assist him. Klinsmann made Michael Ballack captain after the Euro 2004. Klinsmann main goal was to help Germany perform well in the next world cup.\nBefore the tournament, not many people expected Germany to do well because of their performance in the last tournaments. However, Germany won the first match of the tournament against Costa Rica. They continued to build confidence, and they eventually advanced to next stage with three wins in the group stage. Germany then beat Sweden 2\u20130 in the Round of 16.\nGermany then faced favourites Argentina in the quarter-finals. Argentina took the lead first in the match with a goal by Roberto Ayala in the 49th minute. Miroslav Klose then equalized with a goal at the 80th minute. The game later went to a penalty shootout, with Germany winning 4\u20132 and their goalkeeper Jens Lehmann making two saves.\nAlthough many then expected Germany to reach the final, they lost in the Semi-finals to Italy after Italy scored two goals in extra time. However, the German team went on to thrash Portugal 3\u20131 in the third place match. After the World Cup, Miroslav Klose won the Golden Boot and Lukas Podolski won the Best Young Player award.Also, four of Germany's players were put in the All-Star squad. When the German team arrived back in Berlin, they were greeted by 500,000 fans who were all honoring the German team.\nJoachim L\u00f6w takes the throne.\nKlinsmann left the German team after the World Cup, with Joachim L\u00f6w taking the throne. L\u00f6w was known for often putting young players in the team. The German team then easily qualified for the UEFA Euro 2008. In the final tournament, Germany advanced to the next round after they finished the group stage with two wins and one loss to Croatia. Germany then played Portugal in the quarter-finals and beat them 3\u20132 with goals from Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose and Michael Ballack. They then went to the Semi-finals against Turkey and barely defeated them 3\u20132 after Philipp Lahm scored on the 90th minute. In the final of the Euro 2008, Spain were the favourites but Germany was believed to have a chance. Spain took control of the game and with Fernando Torres's goal, Spain won the tournament.\n2010 FIFA World Cup.\nGermany easily qualified in their qualifying group against Azerbaijan, Finland, Liechtenstein, Russia and Wales. In the tournament, Germany advanced through the group stage after winning two games and loosing one against Serbia. Germany then went on to dominate the Round of 16 and Quarter-finals after defeating England 4\u20131 and thrashing Argentina 4\u20130. In the semi-finals, Germany lost to Spain 1\u20130. Germany then beat Uruguay 3\u20132 to become the third place medal winners. Thomas M\u00fcller won the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player award. Germany also scored the most than any other team in the tournament, with 16 goals.\nEuro 2012.\nGermany won all ten of their qualifying matches for the UEFA Euro 2012. They later were placed in Group B along with Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark. The team went on to win all their matches in the group stage and broke a record of 15 consecutive wins in all matches. They then beat Greece 4\u20132 in the quarter-finals with goals from Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Miroslav Klose and Marco Reus. However, they lost to Italy 1\u20132 in the semi-finals.\n2014 FIFA World Cup.\nGermany almost had ten straight wins in the qualifying round for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, in a game against Sweden, the team conceded 4 goals when they were up 4\u20130 up. The team performed well in the international friendlies before the World Cup with an unbeaten streak. Their most notable win was against Armenia, where they won 6\u20131. Germany was put in Group G with Portugal, Ghana and the United States.\nThe first match against Portugal ended with Germany defeating them 4\u20130; with the help of Thomas M\u00fcller's hat-trick. Their second game against Ghana ended with a 2\u20132 draw after Miroslav Klose equalized the score. Their final game ended with a win against the United States after Thomas M\u00fcller scored at the 55th minute. In the quarter-finals, Mats Hummels scored the winning goal at the 13th minute, meaning that Germany advanced to their fourth consecutive semi-final in the FIFA World Cup. In the semi-final against Brazil, Germany thrashed them with a 7\u20131 win, making it the largest win in FIFA World Cup semi-final history. Miroslav Klose also scored a record breaking goal that made him the top scorer in FIFA World Cup history. The win began to be known as the Miracle of Belo Horizonte. Germany then went on to their 8th World Cup final in history. In the final, Mario G\u00f6tze scored at the 113th minute to help Germany defeat Argentina 1\u20130.\nEuro 2016.\nGermany was put in a qualifying group with Poland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Georgia and Gibraltar.

Ikenobo was started by a Buddhist priest called Ikenobo Senkei in the 15th century. It uses standing flowers (called \"rikka\"). It is a Buddhist way of showing the beauty of nature. There are 7 branches. Each branch represents something in nature, e.g. a hill, valley, waterfall etc. Later, in the 17th century, it became simpler and was called \"shoka\". Shoka uses just 3 branches called \"ten\" (heaven), \"chi\" (earth) and \"jin\" (man). \nAnother form of Ikebana is called cha-bana.

{"id": "56178", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56178", "title": "Tide", "text": "A tide is the periodic rising and falling of Earth's ocean surface caused mainly by the gravitational pull of the Moon acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of marine and estuarine (river mouth) waters. Tides also make oscillating currents known as tidal streams (~'rip tides'). This means that being able to predict the tide is important for coastal navigation. The strip of seashore that is under water at high tide and exposed at low tide, called the intertidal zone, is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\nThe height of tides varies somewhat with the phases of the Moon. At New Moon and Full Moon, tides are higher because the Sun's tidal force adds to the Moon's. This is called \"spring tide\".\nTwo tides a day.\nIn most places, there are two tides a day. They each have a high point (the high tide) and a low point (the low tide). We speak of a \"flood tide\" coming in towards high tide, and an \"ebb tide\" going out towards low tide.\nThe period of the tide is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes, exactly half a \"tidal lunar day\". \nThe Moon orbits the Earth in the same direction as the Earth rotates on its axis, so it takes slightly more than a day\u2014about 24 hours and 50 minutes\u2014for the Moon to return to the same location in the sky. During this time, it has passed overhead once and underfoot once, so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above-mentioned, about 12 hours and 25 minutes. This is analogous to the minute hand on a watch crossing the hour hand at 12:00 and then again at about 1:05\u00bd (not at 1:00).\nBecause a gravitational field weakens with distance, the Moon's gravity exerts a slightly stronger pulling force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \"stretch\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium\u2014there is never time for the fluid to \"catch up\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant\u2014the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.\nOther things, such as atmospheric pressure and the Sun's gravity, also affect the tides, but in most places those things do much less than the Moon's gravity does.

The first method - generating energy from tidal currents - is becoming more popular because people believe that it does not harm the environment as much as barrages or dams. Many coastal sites worldwide are being examined to see if they can be used to produce tidal (current) energy. \nLike other hydroelectricity (electricity made using water), tidal power produces no pollution and is a renewable energy source, because tides are caused by events that happen in the solar system and so will not run out. Tidal power has great potential for future power and electricity generation because of the very large amount of energy contained in these rotational systems. Tidal power is reliably predictable (unlike wind power and solar power). In Europe, tide mills have been used for nearly 1,000 years, mainly for grinding grains. Modern tide mills provide tidal stream power.\nMany things affect tides. The pull of the Moon is the largest effect, and most of the energy comes from the slowing of the Earth's spin."}

In most respects a statesman is the opposite of a politician. Politicians are thought of as people who will say or do anything to get elected or to gain power. A statesman is someone who does everything for the common good of the people he or she represents. To call a person a statesman is a mark of high regard for that person's integrity. To call someone a politician usually implies the person is worthy of very little esteem. For example, George Washington is almost always called a statesman. An elder statesman is a term often defined as an older politician or advisor who is thought to be above normal politics.\nStatesman principals.\nIn 51 BC, Cicero published his work \"De re publica\" (\"On the Republic\"). The dialog was about what made a true statesman. It was about the virtues and ideals such a leader must have. Cicero wrote that a great statesman did not have to descend from aristocrats. But he must have \"virtus\" (virtue), \"iustitia\" (a sense of justice) and wisdom. He must also have \"dignitas\" (roughly translated as dignity), temperance and must show generosity and be magnanimous.\nA statesman has certain core values and will not change beliefs simply to advance a political career. If a change in policy is necessary for the good of the people he or she serves, the change will be made no matter how much it is criticized. According to Hans J. Morgenthau, author of \"Politics Among Nations\", statesmen see things realistically; as they really are. They look at how a policy will affect a nation. A statesman is not the same as a monarch or king because their goals are not the same. A statesman does not want to dominate or control people, he or she wants to educate them so they are fit to live in a democracy. Like Plato before him, Alexis de Tocqueville believed that a statesman not only educated his or her people, he somehow shaped their character.\nWhen Abraham Lincoln became President of the United States in 1861, most people saw an awkward, rumpled country bumpkin. He had never traveled to Europe and was seen by the American people and foreign dignitaries alike as crude and unsophisticated. The Dutch minister reported of Lincoln: \u201cHe and his wife seem like .\u2009.\u2009. western farmers, and even in this country, where one has no right to be fastidious, their common manners and their ways expose them in unfortunate fashion to ridicule.\u201d While many do not remember Lincoln as a great foreign-policy president, he actually was. Like a true statesman, Lincoln adeptly guided foreign policy at a time of great peril during the Civil War when the United States was vulnerable to foreign intervention. According to Kevin Peraino, Lincoln \"should be considered one of America\u2019s seminal foreign-policy presidents \u2014 a worthy model for students of global affairs.\" Historians have long shown Lincoln to have been a great statesman who worked tirelessly to build his country into something greater than it was. He laid the groundwork for America's later rise to become a world power."}

They tried to cross near the Britz district canal.\nGueffroy and Gaudian thought that the \"Schie\u00dfbefehl\", the order to shoot anyone who attempted to cross the wall, had been stopped. Climbing the last metal fence, the two were seen and shot at by the National People's Army (NVA) border troops. Gueffroy was hit in the chest by ten shots and died in the border strip.\nGaudian was badly injured, and was arrested and was sentenced on 24 May 1989 to imprisonment for three years by the Pankow district court for trying illegally to cross the border (\"versuchten ungesetzlichen Grenz\u00fcbertritts im schweren Fall\").\nIn September 1989 Gaudian was freed on bail by the East German government and on 17 October 1989 he was transferred to West Berlin.\nThe four border guards at first got an award (\"Leistungsabzeichen der Grenztruppen\") from the chief of the local border guards, Erich W\u00f6llner, and a prize of 150 East German Marks each. After the reunification of East and West Germany, they were prosecuted by Berlin regional court. Two of them were released in January 1992. Ingo Heinrich, who fired the shot that killed Gueffroey was sentenced to three and a half years in jail. The Bundesgerichtshof reduced the penalty to a suspended sentence of two years in 1994.\nIn 2000, two SED officials, Siegfried Lorenz and Hans-Joachim B\u00f6hme, were tried for the death of Gueffroy and two other young men, but acquitted as the judge could find no evidence that they might have been able to lift the shoot-to-kill order. The case was retried on 7 August 2004, and the two men were found guilty and given suspended sentences of 15 months each. The judge explained that the short sentences were due to the length of time since the events. This was the last case concerning deaths on the inner German border.\nOn 21 June 2003, which would have been his 35th birthday, a monument to Gueffroy was built on the banks of the Britz district canal. The monument was designed by Berlin artist Karl Biedermann."}

Most comes from rotary electrical generators turned by various engines. \nHistory.\nMaking electricity in one central place became useful when electric power distribution was possible. This required power transformers which could change voltage. Electricity could be sent as alternating current along electric power lines for great distances cheaply.\nPeople have been using electric light bulbs, electric motors, and other things that use electricty since the late 19th century. Different sources of energy have been used to run generators, including coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, and petroleum power and a small amount from solar energy, tidal harnesses, wind generators, and geothermal sources.\nElectricity demand.\nThe demand for electricity can be met in two different ways. The main method is to build large centralized projects to generate and transmit the electricity required. Many of these projects have caused unpleasant environmental effects such as air or radiation pollution and the flooding of large areas of land.\nDistributed generation creates power on a smaller scale at locations on the electricity network. These sites often generate electricity as a byproduct of other industry such as using gas from landfills to power turbines.\nMethods of generating electricity.\nTurbines.\nRotating turbines attached to electrical generators produce most commercially available electricity. Turbines are driven by a fluid which acts as an intermediate energy carrier. The fluids typically used are:\nCombined cycle gas turbine plants are driven by both steam and gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine and use residual heat to generate additional electricity from steam. These plants offer efficiencies of up to 60%.\nReciprocating engines.\nSmall electricity generators are often powered by reciprocating engines burning diesel fuel, biogas or natural gas. Diesel generators are often used for backup power, usually at low voltages. Biogas is often combusted where it is produced, such as a landfill or wastewater treatment plant, with a reciprocating engine or a microturbine, which is a small gas turbine.\nPhotovoltaic panels.\nUnlike the solar heat concentrators, photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free, solar panels cost a lot of money to make and have only a 10-20% conversion efficiency. Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as an extra electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed solar capacity is growing by 30% per year in several regions including Germany, Japan, California and New Jersey."}

{"id": "56259", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56259", "title": "Bloc Party", "text": "Bloc Party are a British indie rock band. The band has four members: Kele Okereke sings and plays rhythm guitar, Russell Lissack plays the lead guitar, Justin Harris plays bass guitar and Louise Bartle plays the drums. The band's music has been compared to bands such as the Cure, Gang of Four and the Strokes.\nThe band formed during the 1999 Reading Festival. They tried many different names before they chose Bloc Party. Moakes joined after reading an advertisement in \"NME\" magazine. Tong was picked through an audition. The band was first noticed when the gave BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer Alex Kapranos a copy of its music demo, \"She's Hearing Voices\". Later it was released as a single.\nIn February 2005, the band released its debut album, \"Silent Alarm\". It received excellent reviews from many critics, and made \"NME\"'s Album of the Year list. The album was successful enough to reach platinum status in the UK a year later. The band released its second album, \"A Weekend in the City\", in 2007. This album reached number two on the UK album chart and number twelve on the \"Billboard\" 200. In August 2008, the band released their third album, \"Intimacy\". 4 years later, in 2012, the band released their fourth album, Four, and in 2016, the band released their fifth album, Hymns.\nHistory.\nEarly days and first releases.\nRussell Lissack and Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in Essex. They saw each other again in 1999 at the Reading Festival and then decided to form a band. Bass guitar player Gordon Moakes joined after answering an advertisement in \"NME\", and drummer Matt Tong joined after an audition. They were called Union at the start, the band chose to call themselves Bloc Party in September 2003 as another way of saying \"block party\". The band have said in interviews that the name was not supposed to be related to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. However, Gordon Moakes said on the group's official Internet forum that the name was made by joining the eastern \"Blocs\" and the western \"parties\", in the political sense. Moakes also said that the name was not chosen only for this reason, but because it \"looked, sounded, and seemed fine, so we went with it.\"\nIn November 2003, Bloc Party had their song \"The Marshals Are Dead\" featured on a compilation album called \"The New Cross\" released by Angular Recording Corporation. They then released their debut single \"She's Hearing Voices\" on the record label Trash Aesthetics, which was new at the time.\nThe band were first noticed after lead singer Okereke went to a Franz Ferdinand concert in 2003. He gave a CD of \"She's Hearing Voices\" to both lead singer Alex Kapranos and Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Afterwards, Lamacq played the song on his radio show. He called the track \"genius\", and he invited them to record a live session for the show. The success of the track led to the release of another single, \"Banquet\", which was released by Moshi Moshi Records. They went on to sign with independent label Wichita Recordings in April 2004.\n\"Silent Alarm\".\nBloc Party's first album, \"Silent Alarm\", was released in the UK in February 2005 on Wichita Recordings. In the United States, it was released in March 2005 by Vice Records. It was given a lot of praise. It was voted as the \"NME\" album of the year for 2005, and reached number three on UK album charts before being certified platinum. The first single from the album, \"So Here We Are\", made the top 5 on UK charts. Further, the singles \"Banquet\", \"Helicopter\" and \"Pioneers\", managed to reach the UK top 20 but did not do as well as \"So Here We Are\". The animated music video for \"Pioneers\" was made by Shoreditch-based designers Minivegas. It was number one in the \"NME\" video charts for four weeks.\nThe band got good reviews from critics in the United States, and they toured there a lot over 2006. At the start of 2006, they finished their tour with sold out shows in Los Angeles, Miami and Berkeley. It sold 350,000 copies in North America and over a million worldwide. After the success of the album, the established electronic group The Chemical Brothers soon collaborated with Okereke for \"Believe\", a track on the Brothers' \"Push the Button\" album. An album of remixes of tracks from \"Silent Alarm\" was released at the end of August in the UK. The album was called \"Silent Alarm Remixed\", and it kept the first album's song list.\nDuring July, Bloc Party recorded two new tracks with \"Silent Alarm\" producer Paul Epworth. The songs were released as an extended play called \"Two More Years\". The release of this EP came with another release of \"Silent Alarm\", which had on it both \"Two More Years\" and old single \"Little Thoughts\". \"Two More Years\" was released later at the same time as their October 2005 UK tour. The single also had a remix of \"Banquet\" done by The Streets, for which a music video was also made.\nThe band also made the track \"The Present\" for the \"\" compilation album. The money raised from this album went to the War Child charity. In 2005, their album track \"Like Eating Glass\" was used on the soundtrack of a horror movie called \"Cry Wolf\". It was also remixed for use on Activision's skateboarding game \"Tony Hawk's American Wasteland\".\n\"A Weekend in the City\".\nBloc Party's second album, \"A Weekend in the City\", was produced by Jacknife Lee. It was published by Wichita in the UK and Vice Records in the US and was released in February 2007. However, it was leaked in November 2006. It was released on the UK iTunes store before in shops, and reached second place in the Official UK Chart. The album did just as well in Australia and Belgium. It entered at number 12 in the \"Billboard\" 200, with 48,000 copies sold. The first single, \"The Prayer\", was released on 29 January. It became the single which did the best in the UK Top 40 for the band, reaching fourth place. Before the release of the album, BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe played a live recording of the band at the Maida Vale studio, featuring both old and new songs, on his radio show on 30 January 2007. On 1 February 2007, \"A Weekend in the City\" was made able free to listen to on the band's official MySpace page.\nThe next single, \"I Still Remember\", was Bloc Party's highest charting single in America. It got to number 24 on the Modern Rock Chart. The band released their third single, \"Hunting for Witches\", in August 2007. The single was their only ARIA Chart entry, getting to number 20.\nIn October 2007 Bloc Party said they would release a new single, \"Flux\", on 13 November\u2014ahead of their end-of-year concerts. The electronic song, also produced by Jacknife Lee, was very different from previous singles released by the band.\nThe band's first concert following the release of \"A Weekend In The City\" was on 5 February 2007, in Reading. It was played live on BBC 6 Music that night. On 20 May 2007, Bloc Party were the first band to play that year on the \"In New Music We Trust\" stage at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend at Preston. They also took part in the UK Live Earth concert on 7 July 2007 at Wembley Stadium. The band also played sets at T in the Park and Oxegen 2007 that same weekend, as well as Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. Bloc Party said that they would tour Australia and New Zealand in August 2007, which would include a special concert at the Splendour in the Grass Festival on 5 August. On 17 September 2007 they recorded a concert for the PBS show Austin City Limits. This was the day after playing at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. On 27 October 2007, the band performed with the Exmoor Singers, a London-based choir, as part of the BBC Electric Proms. They played songs from both \"Silent Alarm\" and \"A Weekend In The City\" along with the first UK live performance of \"Flux\". During 2007, Russell Lissack formed his side project group Pin Me Down with Melina Mepris.\n\"Intimacy\".\n\"Mercury\", the first single from Bloc Party's third album \"Intimacy\", was played on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 7 July 2008. It then appeared on the Radio 1 website fifteen minutes later. The exclusive followed a countdown timer which was put in place of the band's website for three days, which ended with a link to the Radio 1 website at the time of Lowe's radio show. Many fans were expecting new songs over the internet, with some being annoyed by the act. The song had an electronic sound like the last single, \"Flux\". During the first play of \"Mercury\" on Radio 1, Kele was with Zane Lowe, and said that Jacknife Lee and Paul Epworth would be producing the new album. It was also said that the single was to be released on 11 August 2008. The video was put out with the single.\nBloc Party's third studio album has a new, electronic sound, even though Kele said this would not be the case. He had said before this that the sound would be as raw as \"Silent Alarm\", but as \"experienced\" as \"A Weekend in the City\".\nThe band talked about the release of their third album with fans on a forum on 18 August 2008. The album then was made available for pre-order in many formats - an MP3 download with the CD release on 27 October 2008. \"Trojan Horse\", a song from the album, was made available to stream through \"NME\"'s website. On 20 August 2008, the band added more album tracks, \"Signs\" and \"One Month Off\", as well as \"Trojan Horse\", to their MySpace profile. On 23-24 August, 2008, the band played concerts at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The band played set-opener \"Mercury\", as well as album track \"One Month Off\". A concert like that one followed a week later on 30 August 2008, when the band played as the main act at the Hydro Connect Music Festival, in Argyll, Scotland.\nDuring Autumn 2008, the band played in North America and Canada. They played at the Virgin Mobile Festival in Toronto on 6 September 2008, and had their first ever American college show at Syracuse University. They had their next live performance in the UK on 30 September 2008 with a special concert in London as part of Q Awards: The Gigs. As well as this, they played at the Glasgow date of MTV Two and Topman's \"Gonzo on Tour\" on 19 October 2008. On 8 September 2008, Bloc Party said that their next single, \"Talons\" would be released on 20 October 2008. The song was not able to be downloaded as part of the pre-order album released on August 27, but did appear on the full album release on 27 October 2008. It was also given to fans who had already bought the download-only album, given out after the song's first play on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show.\nAfter the digital release of \"Intimacy\", Bloc Party said to the public that they would go on another UK tour, starting on 25 January 2009 in Glasgow. They will then play in Manchester and Wolverhampton in the same month, with another gig in Wolverhampton on 1 February 2009. Their first UK tour since December 2007 will finish on 12 April 2009 in London. Also in early 2009, the band toured North America in many small places. In June 2009 they announced that their new single is called One More Chance. This song was not on Intimacy and was played on Radio One on the 18th of June 2009. It was released during August 2009."}

It is \"popular\" because it is made for the whole \"population\", not just for scientists. Nature documentaries are examples of popular science.\nPopular science is non-fiction, so it is not the same as \"science fiction\". Popular science is also not the same as \"Science journalism\". Science journalism is what journalists write to report the newest theories and discoveries made in science, but popular science is not always about what is newest.\nSome famous people who make popular science are David Attenborough, Isaac Asimov, Jacob Bronowski, Arthur C. Clarke, Martin Gardner, J.B.S. Haldane, Stephen Hawking, Bill Nye, and Carl Sagan.\nPopular science and scientific literature.\nWhen scientists write about their work, first they publish in scientific journals such as \"Nature\" and \"Science\". Then they may write books. The purpose of popular science is to show scientific literature in a way that different types of scientists, and people who are not scientists, will easily understand. When people take an idea from scientific literature and change it into popular science, important things about that idea may be left out or added in.\nPopular science is a bridge between the literature written for scientists, and the realms of popular writing which ordinary people use. The goal of the genre is to capture the methods and accuracy of science, while making the language more accessible.\nPopular science has its problems. Some popular science is made by people who do not understand the subject well. Some is made by people who have a strong bias. Some is part science and part pseudoscience. It can be hard for someone who is not an expert to tell which works of popular science are reliable. Museums, television programs and websites are also in the business of communicating science to the wider public. Not all of these are reliable. The oldest institution devoted to link science to the public may be the Gresham College, which was founded in 1597 in London. It was not entirely devoted to science. The Royal Institution in London has similar aims, and is devoted to science. It was founded in 1799. Both of these institutions have always given lectures by experts to the general public. "}

When he was a boy Max helped his father to rebuild an organ that was going to be thrown away. This was the instrument on which he learned to play. It was some time before he started proper lessons, but by the time he was a teenager he was playing the organ for church services. When he was 15 he went to Bayreuth to hear Wagner\u2019s operas. This was the moment when Reger decided he wanted to become a musician.\nReger studied music in Munich and Wiesbaden with a famous teacher Hugo Riemann. He composed a lot of music, especially for the organ. His musical style was similar to that of Brahms, but he also learned a lot from the music of Bach, Mendelssohn and Schumann. He liked the symphonic poems of Liszt and these gave him the ideas for writing chorale fantasies for the organ, although he never wrote music that tells a story (programme music).\nIn 1902 Reger married. He and his wife adopted two children. In 1907 he became professor of composition at the University of Leipzig. He was a very good teacher. He became well-known abroad. He travelled to London where he spent hours in the art galleries. Then he bored his friends by talking all the time about the paintings. He conducted the orchestra at Meiningen, performing works by many composers, especially Brahms, Bruckner and his own.\nReger enjoyed eating and drinking. He regularly went to his local caf\u00e9 where he would eat ten large sausages and drink ten glasses of beer.

Sometimes the theme is one they made up, at other times they took a theme that another composer had already written and then made variations on it.\nThere are lots of ways of varying a tune, and each variation will change it in a different way. A variation may play the tune much faster or much slower, it may change the tune by adding extra sharps and flats or other ornamental notes, or by playing the tune in octaves. It may change the harmony or the rhythm or use different instruments. It may combine the tune in different parts (counterpoint).\nHistory in music.\nComposers have used variations in music for centuries. In the Renaissance and Baroque periods composers wrote variations on a short tune in the bass which was repeated again and again. This was called a ground bass or sometimes it was a passacaglia or chaconne. Renaissance composers also liked writing what they called \u201cdivisions\u201d. This meant varying a tune by playing it, for example, at twice the speed or half the speed etc. so that crotchets (quarter notes) became minims (half notes) or quavers (eighth notes).\nGeorge Frideric Handel wrote a famous set of variations for harpsichord called \"Harmonious Blacksmith\", and Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the \"Goldberg Variations\", which was a set of 30 variations: a very long piece of music. It was written for a man who found it difficult to sleep at night, so he would ask his harpsichord player, whose name was Goldberg, to play to him.\nMany composers from the Classical, Romantic and 20th century classical music periods wrote sets of variations. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote several, one of which was based on a French folktune which we know in Britain as \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u201d. Beethoven wrote several wonderful sets of variations. Many of them were for piano, but he also used the form in other pieces e.g. the slow movement of his . Schubert often wrote variations on tunes from his own songs.\nOther composers who wrote variations include Brahms, Elgar, Schoenberg, and Britten."}

It was designed to investigate the definition of functions, and how to apply them. It is also a tool for analysing recursion. It was introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s. Church used lambda calculus in 1936 to give a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. \nLambda calculus can be used to define what is a computable function. No general algorithm can answer the question of whether two lambda calculus expressions are equivalent. This was the first question, even before the halting problem, for which undecidability could be proved. Lambda calculus has greatly influenced functional programming languages, such as LISP, ML and Haskell.\nLambda calculus can be called the smallest universal programming language. It consists of just one transformation rule (variable substitution) and just one way to define a function. Each \"function definition\" comes together with a list of the function's parameters, i.e. variables that can be used inside that definition. \"Variable substitution\" means substitution of values for variables, that is, a transformation step where an application of a function to some arguments is replaced with that function's definition in which all variables (that appear in its list of parameters) are replaced with arguments used in that application. \nLambda calculus is universal in the sense that any computable function can be expressed and evaluated using this formalism. It is thus the same as the Turing machine formalism. However, lambda calculus emphasizes the use of transformation rules. It does not care about the actual machine that implements them. It is an approach more related to software than to hardware."}

Very often, people with anxiety also feel worries. There can also be physical symptoms, like having a headache or an upset stomach.\nAnxiety is a very common human emotion and is often associated with fear, panic, and the fight or flight response. The amount of stress needed to cause anxiety will vary from person to person however, basics include: losing one's job, the death of a loved one, or an accident, to name a few. In most people, anxiety will settle over time and one will return to normal state. \nSome people suffer a lot of anxiety over a long period of time which controls them and makes their lives difficult. These conditions are called anxiety disorders and can be treated by therapy and medicine.\nGeneral anxiety symptoms are things such as; continual tiredness / exhaustion, inability to relax, lack of confidence, low self-esteem, fear of public places, fear of socializing, frequent feelings of irrational anxiety / fear, compulsive behavior, worrying about making mistakes, regular nightmares, disturbed sleep patterns, excessive crying, headaches, stomach problems, diarrhea, nausea, aching muscles, and so on.\nSymptoms of anxiety attacks are things like; sweating, shaking and tremors, palpitations, shortness of breath, hyperventilating, racing heart beat, tingling in hands and feet, feeling of impending doom, feeling you are having a heart attack. There are more, but these are the usual ones.\nMedicine.\nThese symptoms, more or less, define anxiety but they can also be signs of other problems, so the first port of call has to be a doctor or other health care professional. They will be able to define what the problem is exactly, and propose the appropriate treatment.\nA doctor\u2019s first line treatment is usually through drug-based medication; for example antidepressants, anti-anxiety tablets and beta blockers. These can be very effective, but they all have side effects, some worse than others. This can tend to put folks off continuing with them. Note however, that many drugs that have been taken for a longer time, need to be stopped in a special way (usually, with the help of a doctor); simply stopping the drug can lead to withdrawal symptoms. \nOther non-drug therapies are becoming popular such as; self-hypnosis, meditation, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, counseling, acupuncture, etc. These are therapies to help people \u2018manage\u2019 or \u2018cope\u2019 with their anxiety and / or anxiety attacks.\nBut what about the underlying cause(s) of anxiety? The two treatment types above focus on either reducing the symptoms of anxiety, or, helping a person cope with their disorder. They don\u2019t seem to do anything about the underlying condition(s) that are causing the anxiety.\nAnd the very \u2018fear\u2019 of another anxiety attack can bring one on. As long as this irrational fear exists it\u2019s very difficult to stop attacks and resolve the general anxiety. Eliminating this fear can prevent further attacks and get rid of the general anxiety much more effectively.\nAnxiety disorders.\nAnxiety disorders are any sort of disorder caused by a major amount of anxiety. There are many different disorders, each of which may be diagnosed by a trained professional. Examples of such disorders are \nNon-medical, religious treatments.\nThe state of anxiety can be calmed with the devotion of the Rosary that allows the person to pray and meditate with a great sense of peace."}

It has been used for thousands of years in many different ways by people all over the world. The oldest uses of solar energy is for heating, cooking, and drying. Today, it is also used to make electricity where other power supplies are not there, such as in places far away from where people live, and in outer space.\nIt is becoming cheaper to make electricity from solar energy. Because the Sun always gives heat and light, solar energy can be considered a renewable energy and an alternative to non-renewable resources like coila and teal.\nEnergy uses.\nSolar energy is used today in a number of ways:\nEnergy from the Sun.\nAfter passing through the Earth's atmosphere, most of the Sun's energy is in the form of visible light and infrared light radiation. Plants convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy (sugars and starches) through the process of photosynthesis. Humans regularly use this store of energy in various ways, as when they burn wood off fossil fuels, or when simply eating plants, fish and animals.\nSolar radiation reaches the Earth's upper atmosphere with the power of 1366 watts per square meter (W/m2). Since the Earth is round, the surface nearer its poles is angled away from the Sun and receives much less solar energy than the surface nearer the equator.\nAt present, solar cell panels convert, at best, about 15% of the sunlight hitting them into electricity. \nThe dark disks in the third diagram on the right are imaginary examples of the amount of land that, if covered with 8% efficient solar panels, would produce slightly more energy in the form of electricity than the world needed in 2003.\nTypes of technologies.\nMany technologies have been developed to make use of solar radiation. Some of these technologies make direct use of the solar energy (e.g. to provide light, heat, etc.), while others produce electricity.\nSolar power plants.\nSolar power plants convert sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using \"concentrated solar power\" (CSP). Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaics converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect.\nRank.\nSolar cooker.\nSolar cooking uses the Sun as the source of energy instead of standard cooking fuels such as charcoal, coal or gas. Solar cookers are an inexpensive and environmentally sound alternative to traditional ovens. They are becoming widely used in areas of the developing world where deforestation is an issue, financial resources to purchase fuel are limited, and where open flames would pose a serious risk to people and the environment. Solar cookers are covered with a glass plate. They achieve a higher temperature by using mirrors to focus the rays of the sun.\nSolar heater.\n The Sun may be used to heat water instead of electricity or gas. There are two basic types of active solar heating systems based on the type of fluid \u2014 either liquid or air \u2014 that is heated in the solar energy collectors. (The collector is the device in which a fluid is heated by the Sun.)\nLiquid-based systems heat water or an antifreeze solution in a \"hydronic\" collector, whereas air-based systems heat air in an \"air collector.\" Both air and liquid systems can supplement forced air systems.\nSolar cells.\nSolar cells can be used to generate electricity from sunlight. It is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy. Sometimes the term \"solar cell\" is reserved for devices intended specifically to capture energy from sunlight, while the term \"photovoltaic cell\" is used when the light source is unspecified.\nSolar cells have many applications. They have long been used in situations where electrical power from the grid is unavailable, such as in remote area power systems, Earth-orbiting satellites and space probes, consumer systems, e.g. handheld calculators or wrist watches, remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications. A large no. of solar cells are combined in an arrangement called solar cell panel that can deliver enough electricity for practical use. Electricity produced by solar panels can be stored in rechargeable solar batteries, which is then drawn upon when required."}

Due to the growing demand for renewable energy sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years, and costs have dropped.\nSolar photovoltaics are growing rapidly, from a small base, to a total global capacity of 130,000 MW at the end of 2013. More than 100 countries use solar PV. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building.\nPanels.\nPhotovoltaic solar panels come in many different voltages. The most common are 12 volts, 24 volts, and 48 volts. Like batteries, multiple solar panels can be connected together to produce higher voltages, for example, two 48 volt panels connected together would produce 96 volts. The inverter, batteries, and solar panels in a system are usually all of the same voltage. The advantage of a higher-voltage system is that thinner wire is used, which is less expensive and easier to pull through conduit. The disadvantage of a higher-voltage installation is that electric shock and arc flash become more of a hazard, so installations above 48 volts are usually only found in solar power plants or commercial buildings.\nA photovoltaic installation typically includes an array of solar panels, an inverter, rechargeable batteries (for use at night), a charge controller (a device that prevents the batteries from over-charging), two GFCI circuit breakers (one before the inverter and one after), and interconnection wiring. There is sometimes also a transformer after the inverter, which can power 240 volt heavy appliances such as a clothes dryer or oven. The transformer is often part of the inverter and can't be seen. Everything past the inverter (or transformer if there is one) is set up like a normal utility-fed installation (breaker panel, lights, outlets, switches, etc.). If there is no transformer, only 120 volt devices may be used. Installations without a transformer must be labelled as such on the breaker panel to alert future electricians that 240 volt appliances can not be installed. Some installations have direct current (DC) lighting and possibly DC appliances. The advantage of this is that for DC loads, the losses in the inverter are avoided. These installations will have a separate DC breaker panel connected before the inverter. For safety reasons, DC wiring cannot be run in the same conduit as AC wiring, and DC outlets must not accept an AC plug and vice versa.\nSolar Cells.\nA solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that changes light energy into electricity. Photovoltaics are best known as a method for making electricity by using solar cells to change energy from the sun into a flow of electrons. The was first noticed by Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel in 1839. Practically all photovoltaic devices are some type of photodiode. \nSolar cells can be used to power tools or to recharge a storage battery. The first actual request of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecrafts, but today the most photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power creation. In this case a tool called an inverter is required to convert the direct current to alternating current. Cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly behind a glass sheet. When more power is required than a single cell can give off, cells are electrically connected together to form photovoltaic modules, or solar panels. A single module is enough to power an emergency telephone, but for a house or a power station the modules must be arranged in multiples as arrays."}

They have many applications. They have long been used in situations where electrical power from the grid is unavailable, such as in remote area power systems, Earth-orbiting satellites and space probes, consumer systems, e.g. handheld calculators or wrist watches, remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications. More recently, they are starting to be used in assemblies of solar modules connected to the electricity grid through an inverter, often in combination with net metering.\nSolar cells are regarded as one of the key technologies towards a sustainable energy supply.\nThree generations of development.\nFirst.\nThe first generation photovoltaic consists of a large-area, single layer p-n junction diode, which is capable of generating usable electrical energy from light sources with the wavelengths of sunlight. These cells are typically made using a silicon wafer. First generation photovoltaic cells (also known as silicon wafer-based solar cells) are the dominant technology in the commercial production of solar cells, accounting for more than 86% of the solar cell market.\nSecond.\nThe second generation of photovoltaic materials is based on the use of thin-film deposits of semiconductors. These devices were initially designed to be high-efficiency, multiple junction photovoltaic cells. Later, the advantage of using a thin-film of material was noted, reducing the mass of material required for cell design. This contributed to a prediction of greatly reduced costs for thin film solar cells. Currently (2007) there are different technologies/semiconductor materials under investigation or in mass production, such as amorphous silicon, poly-crystalline silicon, micro-crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride, copper indium selenide/sulfide. Typically, the efficiencies of thin-film solar cells are lower compared with silicon (wafer-based) solar cells, but manufacturing costs are also lower, so that a lower price in terms of $/watt of electrical output can be achieved. Another advantage of the reduced mass is that less support is needed when placing panels on rooftops and it allows fitting panels on light materials or flexible materials, even textiles. This allows for portable roll-up solar panels, which can fit in a backpack and be used to power cell phones or laptops in remote areas.\nThird.\nThird generation photovoltaics are very different from the other two, broadly defined as semiconductor devices which do not rely on a traditional p-n junction to separate photogenerated charge carriers. These new devices include photoelectrochemical cells, Polymer solar cells, and nanocrystal solar cells.\nCompanies working on third generation photovoltaics include \"Xsunx, Konarka Technologies, Inc.\", \"Nanosolar\" and \"Nanosys\". Research is also being done in this area by the USA's \"National Renewable Energy Laboratory\" (http://www.nrel.gov/)."}

This means that the direction of current flowing in a circuit is constantly being reversed back and forth. This is done with any type of AC voltage source. \nThe usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave, because this leads to the most efficient transmission of energy. However, in certain applications different waveforms are used, such as triangular or square waves. Inexpensive power inverters produce a square wave with a pause between the change in direction.\nWhen one speaks of alternating current one mostly refers to the form in which electricity is delivered to businesses and residences. The AC comes from a power plant. The direction of the electricity switches back 60 times every second (or 50 times in some parts of the world). This happens so fast that a light bulb does not stop glowing.\nBoth audio and radio signals carried on electrical wire are also examples of alternating current. In these applications, an important goal is often the recovery of information encoded (or modulated) onto the AC signal.\nHistory.\nNikola Tesla experimented with electrical resonance and studied various lighting systems. He invented an induction motor, new types of generators and transformers, and a system of alternating current power transmission.\nWilliam Stanley, Jr. designed one of the first practical devices to transfer AC power efficiently between isolated circuits. Using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core, his design, called an induction coil, was an early precursor of the modern transformer. The system used today was devised in the late nineteenth century, largely by Nikola Tesla. Contributions were also made by George Westinghouse, Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs,Wilhelm Siemens and Oliver Shallenger. AC systems overcame the limitations of the direct current system used by Thomas Edison to distribute electricity efficiently over long distances. \nThe Mill Creek hydroelectric plant was built near Redlands, California in 1893. Designed by Almirian Decker, it used 10,000 volt three-phase electric power which eventually became the standard method for power stations throughout the world.\nHow it Works.\nAC power is cheaper and easier to make electronic devices. The power switches for AC power are also less expensive to make. It is less expensive than DC because you can increase and decrease the current very easily. AC can use high voltages with smaller current to reduce losses when you send power. AC reduces the heating in the wires. DC power could be sent, but it would lose a lot of energy and you would have to put more work in it to send it great distances. AC transformers are installed everywhere, including atop utility poles and underground. Alternating current works by switching the current many times back and forth constantly while it goes back to the source it came from."}

Direct current used to be called \"Galvanic current\".\nBatteries are some of the main sources of direct current (DC), but many other sources also exist such as bridge rectifiers in power supply, solar panels, etc.\nTypically, the current goes through a conductor and other things that can carry DC. DC is also sent through a vacuum as in electron beams or ion beams.\nThe first commercial electric power transmission was developed by Thomas Edison in the late nineteenth century using direct current. Today nearly all electric power distribution uses alternating current because of the advantages with transformers and transmission. High-voltage direct current is often used for transporting electricity to places far away.\nFor applications requiring direct current, the alternating current is typically distributed to a substation and then converted to direct current.\nLong after the usage of direct current had been established, physicists realized that the current was made of negative electric charges, the electrons, and that the actual flow was from the negative to the positive pole (and so-called \"holes\" flow in the opposite direction), but by convention, the usage of the term was never changed."}

It is like a car, only instead of wheels, it has treads. Some snowmobiles have skis in the front for steering. \nAdding snowmobile studs to the tread decreases the time and distance it takes to stop a snowmobile. Once you make a decision to stop a snowmobile, the distance it will take to stop will be a combination of the speed of the machine, weight of the machine and the available friction and or the mechanical damping (which will equal the effective drag factor) between the snowmobile and the surface on which it is trying to stop. If the surface is icy or hard-packed, the mechanical damping portion of the effective drag factor is decreased, leaving you with only the friction provided by the tread to stop.\nSnowmobile studs made from steel or stainless steel with carbide tips are installed in the tread. The studs are designed for specific terrains in varying lengths, shapes and materials. The studs control acceleration, deceleration and maneuverability. The correct amount and type of stud installed in an effective pattern will produce the best traction results."}

Members of the two bands were friends, and often played at the same places back in Liverpool, or would go to watch each other perform.\nAfter the Beatles became famous under Brian Epstein's management, Epstein signed up the Remo Four also. He worked hard to promote the band, but they never achieved massive success as the Beatles had. Epstein paired the Remo Four with a singer he also managed, called Tommy Quickly. They made a series of singles together, but none became hits. Quickly retired from music, and the Remo Four went on to work with other singers, including Billy J. Kramer. They also released an album, titled \"Smile\", on a German record label.\nGeorge Harrison was invited to record a movie soundtrack in late 1967. Instead of working with the Beatles, he invited the Remo Four to work with him. The movie, \"Wonderwall\", got little exposure, but the soundtrack album, \"Wonderwall Music\", became a minor hit the next year."}

The statement \"\"m\" is a divisor of \"n\"\" can be written as formula_1. Any number is always divisible by 1 and itself, which are two of the divisors. A prime number is a number with no other divisors. The positive divisors of a number \"n\", other than \"n\" itself, are the proper divisors of \"n\".\nFinding one or more factors of a given number is called factorization.\nExplanation.\nFor example, 7 is a divisor of 42 because 42\u00f77 = 6. We also say that \"42 is divisible by 7\", \"42 is a multiple of 7\", \"7 divides 42\", or \"7 is a factor of 42\", and we usually write 7 | 42. For example, the positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\nIn general, we say that \"m\" divides \"n\" for non-zero integers \"m\" and \"n\", if and only if there exists an integer \"k\" such that \"n\" = \"km\". Thus, divisors can be negative as well as positive, although we often restrict our attention to positive divisors. (For example, there are six divisors of four, 1, 2, 4, -1, -2, -4, but one would usually mention only the positive ones, 1, 2, and 4.) \n1 and -1 divide (are divisors of) every integer, every integer is a divisor of itself, and every integer is a divisor of 0, except by convention 0 itself (see also Division by zero). Numbers divisible by 2 are called even, and numbers not divisible by 2 are called odd.\nA divisor of \"n\" that is not 1, -1, \"n\" or -\"n\" is known as a non-trivial divisor; numbers with non-trivial divisors are known as composite numbers, while prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors.\nThe name comes from the arithmetic operation of division: if \"a\u00f7b\" = \"c\", then \"a\" is the dividend, \"b\" the divisor, and \"c\" the quotient.\nSpotting divisors.\nThere are properties which allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits. Those properties can be used as \"math tricks\" to quickly spot some divisors of a number.\nFor example, if the last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6 or 8), then 2 is a divisor. If the last digit is 0 or 5, then 5 is a divisor. If the digits add up to a multiple of 3, then 3 is a divisor. For the number 340, ending in \"0\" then both 2 and 5 are divisors, plus 2\u00d75 = 10 is also a divisor. Dividing by 10, 340/10 = 34, as finally 2\u00d717. Combining all the smaller numbers, the 12 divisors of 340 are:\nNote that any number is always evenly divisible by 1 and itself."}

It is 200 km south of the centre of mainland Australia. It is about halfway between Darwin in the north and Adelaide in the south.\nIn 2005 there were 26,486 people living in Alice Springs. This makes it the second largest town in the Northern Territory.\nAlice Springs is often called \"the Alice\" or simply \"Alice.\u201d It is called \"Mparntwe\" by the Arrernte. The Arrernte people are the Aboriginal people who have lived around Alice Springs for more than 50,000 years.\nHistory.\nIndigenous History.\nAccording to the Arrernte traditional stories, the land around Alice Springs was shaped by caterpillars, wild dogs, travelling boys, two sisters, euros and other ancestral figures. There are many sites of traditional importance in and around Alice Springs. These include Anthwerrke (Emily Gap), Akeyulerre (Billy Goat Hill), Ntaripe (Heavitree Gap), Atnelkentyarliweke (Anzac Hill) and Alhekulyele (Mt. Gillen).\nEarly city.\nIn 1862, John McDouall Stuart led an expedition into Central Australia and the area where Alice Springs is located. Until the 1930s the town was known as Stuart. The Australian Overland Telegraph Line that joined Adelaide to Darwin and Great Britain was completed in 1872. It followed Stuart\u2019s route. It opened up the interior for permanent European settlement. When surface alluvial gold was found at Arltunga, 100\u00a0km east of Alice Springs, in 1887 many people began to move into the area.\nThe telegraph station was built near a waterhole in the normally dry Todd River. It was thought to be a permanent source of water, and was named Alice Springs. Alice was the wife of the former Postmaster General of South Australia, Sir Charles Todd. The Todd River was named after Sir Charles.\nThe original method of travel in the outback were camels. These camel trains were run by people from Pathan tribes in the North-West frontier of India and Pakistan. They were wrongly called \u2018Afghans\u2019 in Australia.\nIn 1929 the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway was built from Darwin as far as Birdum, Northern Territory. The Great Northern Railway had been built in 1891 from Port Augusta as far as Oodnadatta, South Australia. The lines wouldn\u2019t meet until 2003. On February 4, 2004, the first passenger train arrived in Darwin.\nDuring the 1960s Alice Springs became an important defence base. About 700 people work at the US/Australian Pine Gap joint defence satellite monitoring base.\nThe major industry in recent times is tourism.\nGeography and climate.\nTopography and climate.\nThe town of Alice Springs built on the banks of the usually dry Todd River. It is on the northern side of MacDonnell Ranges. The region where Alice Springs is located is known as Central Australia, or the Red Centre. It is a very dry region, made up of several different deserts.\nTemperatures can vary by up to 28\u00a0\u00b0C. In summer the average highest temperature is in the high 30s. In winter the average lowest temperature can be -7.5\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe rainfall can vary quite a lot from year to year. The annual average rainfall is 286\u00a0mm. In 2001 741 mm fell, but in 2002 only 198\u00a0mm fell.\nEconomy.\nAlice Springs began as a town to supply the cattle farms that first came to the area. The arrival of the railway increased its economy and productivity. Today the town supplies a region of 546,046 square kilometres. There are 38,749 people living in the region. The region includes a number of mining and farm communities, the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap and tourist attractions.\nThe people.\nIn June 2004, 38,749 people lived in the region. There were 26,058 people living in the city of Alice Springs.

Alice Springs is the business centre of Central Australia. Aboriginal people come from all over the region to use the town's services. Aboriginal residents usually live in the suburbs, on special purpose leases (or town camps). Some live farther out at Amoonguna to the south. Many live on the small family outstation communities on Aboriginal Lands in surrounding areas.\nThe traditional owners of the Alice Springs area are the Central Arrernte people. As it is the largest town in central Australia, there are also speakers of at least thirteen other languages.\nAmerican influence.\nThe American influence in Alice Springs comes from Pine Gap, a US satellite tracking station. It is 19\u00a0km south-west of Alice Springs. Pine Gap employs 700 American and Australians. There are about 2,000 people in the Alice Springs region who are US citizens.\nAmerican influence can be seen throughout Alice Springs.

It has a range of services to encourage and help Aboriginal people improve their quality of life on remote communities.\nSport.\nAustralian Rules Football is a popular sport in Alice Springs. The Central Australian Football League has several teams and many people play. The sport is very popular in Indigenous communities. The local stadium, Traeger Park, can hold 10,000 people.

A pianist playing a concert by himself will be giving a \"piano recital\". A \"violin recital\" will be given by a violinist and piano accompanist.\nPeople started talking about \"recitals\" in the middle of the 19th century. Pianists such as Liszt became famous when they travelled about giving piano recitals. Soon piano manufacturers (firms that make pianos) and concert agents started to sponsor famous pianists to give recitals. These great pianists became great stars in the way that, in music, only opera singers had been great stars before. Some concert halls have become well-known places for recitals, e.g. the Bosendorfersaal in Vienna, the Beethovensaal in Berlin, the Wigmore Hall in London and the Carnegie Hall in New York.\nSome pianists became known for playing recitals of music by just one composer. Recitals of Chopin's music were particularly popular. \"Song recitals\" (or \"vocal recitals\") are given by singers who sing Lieder and sometimes arias from operas."}
