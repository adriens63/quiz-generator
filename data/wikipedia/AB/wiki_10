The ecosystem depends on them, and would be much changed if they were not there. This is because they affect many other organisms in the ecosystem. They affect the types and numbers of other species in the community. \nSome sea stars (e.g. \"Pisaster ochraceus\") prey on sea urchins, mussels, and other shellfish that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably. This drives out most other species. The urchin population grows likewise, and destroys coral reefs. Living coral reefs are the habitat for many hundreds of other species.\nSome other examples of keystone species are the sea otter, horseshoe crab, and wolves. Sea otters and kelp depend on each other. Without the sea otter, sea urchins would destroy the kelp, and much else in the ecosystem. "}

The experiment is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a null hypothesis. Fisher's description is less than ten pages long and is notable for its simplicity and completeness regarding terminology, calculations and design of the experiment. The example is loosely based on an event in Fisher's life. The lady in question was Muriel Bristol, and the test used was Fisher's exact test.\nThe experiment.\nThe lady in question claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance.\nIf and only if the Lady properly categorized all eight cups was Fisher willing to reject the null hypothesis \u2013 effectively acknowledging the Lady's ability at a 1.4% significance level (but without quantifying her ability). Fisher later discussed the benefits of more trials and repeated tests.\nDavid Salsburg reports that a colleague of Fisher, H. Fairfield Smith, revealed that in the test, the woman got all eight cups correct. The chance of someone who just guesses getting all correct, assuming she guesses that four had the tea put in first and four the milk, would be only 1 in 70 (the combinations of 8 taken 4 at a time).\nIn popular science, Salsburg published a book entitled \"The Lady Tasting Tea\", which describes Fisher's experiment and ideas on randomization. Deb Basu wrote that \"the famous case of the 'lady tasting tea'\" was \"one of the two supporting pillars . . . of the randomization analysis of experimental data\"."}

First, a violet dye is put on the bacteria. This dye stains peptidoglycan, a thick layer that is only found in gram-positive bacteria. After the first stain, another stain (usually safranin or fuchsin) gives all gram-negative bacteria a red or pink colour.\nThe Gram stain is almost always the first step in the identification of a bacterial organism. However, not all bacteria can be classified by this technique. Bacteria for which the method does not work are called 'gram-variable' or 'gram-indeterminate'.\nGram developed the technique working with another scientist, Carl Friedl\u00e4nder in a hospital in Berlin. However, Gram first used the test to make bacteria in the lungs easier to see. He published his finished method in 1884."}

Many Russians believe that a local tribe called the Mansi people killed them for trespassing on their property. Others believe that the military had something to do with their death.

The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held. \nScopes was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution but he purposely incriminated himself so that the case could have a defendant. \nScopes was found guilty and fined $100, but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity. National reporters came to Dayton to cover the big-name lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate, argued for the prosecution, while Clarence Darrow, the famed defense attorney, spoke for Scopes. \nThe trial publicized the Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy. This set \"Modernists\", who said evolution was not inconsistent with religion, against Fundamentalists, who said the word of God as revealed in the Bible took priority over all human knowledge. The case was thus seen as both a theological contest and a trial on whether modern evolutionary biology should be taught in schools.\nThe Tennessee law was not repealed until 1967."}

Fluvial terrace is divided into Rock terrace and Gravel terrace according to structure materials, and it is also classified as Tectonic terrace and Climate terrace according to causes of formation.\nClassification.\nFluvial terraces are either called erosional or depositional.\nErosional terrace.\nErosional terrace is a terrace that the tread has been formed primarily by lateral erosion. During low water level stage, fine sediment is deposited and during normal flow, coarse sediment is deposited at the end of a high water event. When the river reaches its highest level, it entrains all the channel sediment and scours the underlying bedrock before coarse detritus is deposited again on the channel floor.\nDepositional terrace.\nDepositional terrace is a terrace that the tread represents the surface of a valley fill. Valley filling occurs when the amount of sediment produced in a basin exceeds the amount that the river system can carry away. It is usually triggered by glacial outwash, climate change, or change in base level, slope, or load caused by rising water level. Depositional terrace is climatically controlled, whereas erosional terrace is tectonically controlled."}

The legal guardian makes decisions for the person who needs protection. Usually, a legal guardian has to be appointed (chosen) by a court. Before a court appoints a guardian for a person, it first has to decide that the person is incompetent (unable to make decisions on their own).\nA court may choose a legal guardian for a minor child (a child under a certain age) in many different situations:\nA court may also choose a legal guardian for an adult. This happens when the court decides the adult is incompetent. The court appoints a legal guardian to help protect the incompetent person (who is called a ward). The legal guardian then has the right to make legal decisions for the ward.\nHow do legal guardians get chosen?\nLegal guardians get chosen in a few different ways.\nSometimes a parent will write a will, which explains their last wishes in case they die. In the will, they can say who they want to take care of their child if the parent dies. If the parent dies, a court still has to approve the person named in the will as the child's new guardian. The new guardian does not have to be a blood relative of the parent or child.\nIf someone (like a person's doctor, psychiatrist, or family member) thinks that a person is incompetent, they may ask a court to choose a legal guardian. In the United States, the court must hold a hearing to decide whether the person needs a guardian. The person must be given a lawyer, and the court must listen to arguments from both sides. If the court decides that the person needs a guardian, the court will choose one. That guardian may be a family member, a friend, or a stranger.\nWhat kind of power do legal guardians have?\nIn the United States, when a court chooses a legal guardian, the court has to say specifically what decisions the guardian will be able to make for their ward. For example, a court might say the guardian can only make medical decisions for their ward. The ward will still have the right to make any other decisions that are not medical decisions.\nDifferent states have different laws about types of guardianships and what decisions guardians can make.\nFor example, in Massachusetts, a court can appoint a Rogers Guardian, who can only make decisions about their ward's psychiatric (mental health) medicines. The ward still has the right to make any other decisions that are not about medications.\nIn other states, like Pennsylvania, a court can appoint a plenary guardian, who has the right to make all decisions for the ward. The ward has no right to make any important decisions for himself or herself."}

After that, they got new guitarist Jim Fairchild and keyboardist Tim Dryden. They released EP A Pretty Mess By This One Band in 1996, and their first full-length album Under The Western Freeway in 1997. \u201cSummer Here Kids\u201d, one of the songs in Under The Western Freeway, earned Single of the Week honors in NME. In 2000, in Sophftware Slump, they created vintage, electronic, drift-off music. In , Concrete Dunes was released, without the band's permission.

On writing songs that make the young girls cry.\" Other members all worked in their own field, but Jim Fairchild was still working with music. He joined a guitarist in Modest Mouse tour, and he released his first solo album, Ten Readings of a Warning. In 2012, the band reunited for Outside Lands Festival in San Francisco. In the same year, they played in End of the Road Festival. No album has been released since then. \nIn an interview, Jason Lytle tell why the band name got their name Grandaddy; They realized that they are too ugly to seduce young women, so they try to appeal to old women, just like Morrissey. Birds frequently appear in their album cover, because birds are beautiful and colorful, and they can sing.\nStyle.\nGrandaddy's music has features in the late 90s lo-fi indie rock. Their music has the catchy melodies that they are able to create with the synths and distorted guitars. Most of their musics are slow and emotional. Also, they used electronics. Their lyrics are mostly vague and abstract, but inventive. The album's most enduring image is a man sipping a beer and strumming an acoustic guitar in quiet, beautiful countryside. The Sophtware Slump is generally regarded as the band's masterpiece, but other albums like Under the Western Freeway are popular, too."}

It consists of the remnants of the United States after a unspecified nuclear crisis. This nation holds an event called The Hunger Games, which consists of 24 adolescents (12 to 16) competing for a month to stay alive with limited objectives, and the objective is to kill all other players and repel attempts by the other players to do the same. \nNovels.\nTrilogy.\nThe Hunger Games.\nThe Hunger Games is set in North America, approximately 250 years after a nuclear war destroys the United States. Survivors banded together to form a nation called Panem, composed of 12 districts and a central Capitol, similar to the United States' current formation, 50 states and a central Capital, where most government operations are situated. Each district produces goods vital to the prosperity of the whole nation. Originally, when the nation was young, it was similar to the democratic republic that the United States maintains. However, as the nation became older, it became more corrupt, morphing into a totalitarian police state, as the population of the Capitol ceased working and maintained control over the districts by fear, not prosperity. The 13th district, the one which encompasses most of the New England states and is in charge of the military, graphite mining, and nuclear weapons, rebelled against the capitol, similar to the American Civil War. The rest of the districts joined in, but the war was lost and District 13 was obliterated by their own weapons. The Capitol saw a new opportunity to control the country, so they forced the remaining Districts to send one adolescent boy and girl using a drawing to participate in the Hunger Games, a competition to the death that makes all 24 district teens fight for resources over 30 days. The objective is to kill others and survive, but the real objective was entertainment for the rich Capitol citizens and eternal punishment for the \"crimes\" they committed against the Capitol. The book centers around Katniss Everdeen, a girl who lives in District 12 who gets selected for the Hunger Games and spends the rest of the book trying to survive. \nThe first book begins with Katniss making sacrifices to feed her family, since District 12 is a very small, poor district. She invests in grain allowances given by the Capitol in exchange for a better chance of being selected for the Hunger Games. One particular day she does so, the Capitol Peacekeepers, the police of Panem, arrive and set up the raffle system for the Hunger Games. As per tradition, the adolescents of District 12 line up in separate gender lines. The Head Peacekeeper pulls 2 tabs out of the raffle, and Peeta Mellark, a boy from the richer center of town, gets chosen. Afterwards, the Head Peacekeeper reads out Katniss's sister Primrose's name, and Katniss objects as an immediate family member. Per tradition, Katniss takes Primrose's place in the raffle, therefore qualifying to participate in the Hunger Games. Katniss gets sent to see a specialist, who fixes up and removes old scars from Hunger Games nominees. Afterwards, the specialist and Katniss have a discussion about what to wear. Tradition states that each district nominee wears clothes representing the goods the district makes. For example, District 1 may be dressed in gold plated clothing, and District 5 is dressed in traditional electrician clothes. Katniss ends up wearing clothes in flames, representing coal and its willingness to combust. After she enters the stadium, she is placed on a circular pressure plate. This plate prevents any nominees from getting a headstart, and the punishment for doing so is death."}

The village is in the community of Penrhyndeudraeth. Its is next to the River Dwyryd. It was created and built by Clough Williams-Ellis. He created and built it between the years 1925 and 1975. He wanted it to look like an Italian village. A charity owns it. Many movies and television shows were filmed there, including \"The Prisoner\".\nHistory.\nPortmeirion looks a lot like the Italian city of Portofino. But, Clough Williams-Ellis, who created Portmeirion, always said that it was \"not\" based on the city of Portofino. He said he did want it to look like it was a place near the Mediterranean, though. He designed and built the village between the years of 1925 and 1975. The mix of architecture in the village is believed to have influenced postmodernism architecture in the late 1900s.\nAn old estate used to be located on the property before Portmeirion was built. It was called \"Aber I\u00e2\" (). The hotel and three cottages, which are named \"White Horses\", \"Mermaid\", and \"The Salutation\", are part of the original estate. It was built in the 1850s. Before the estate, there was a foundry and a boatyard on site. There is also an old site which has a small group of remains from a mediaeval castle nearby.\nIn 1931, Williams-Ellis bought a Victorian mansion from his uncle Sir Osmund Williams, Bt. It was called Castell Deudraeth. Williams-Ellis planned on having the mansion be a part of the hotel. Lots of problems and the war did not allow that to happen. Williams-Ellis loved the building a lot and did anything he could to make it a part of the hotel. He received money from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, and Wales Tourist Board. This money allowed him to finally open Castell Deudraeth as a hotel with 11 bedrooms and a restaurant on August 20, 2001. Bryn Terfel performed at the opening.\nThere are a lot of rhododendrons at Portmeirion, which are part of gardens that go throughout the land. The gardens were started before Williams-Ellis lived there. They were started by George Henry Caton Haigh. An English charity owns Portmeirion, today. It is still a hotel. There is also a cafe, cottages for rent, shops, a tearoom, and a restaurant.\nLewis Mumford has written a lot about Portmeirion. He wrote a lot about it in his book, \"The Highway and the City\" in 1964.\nPopular culture.\nA lot of people have found inspiration in Portmeirion. No\u00ebl Coward wrote the play \"Blithe Spirit\" while staying in a cottage at Portmeirion. Frank Lloyd Wright, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul McCartney have visited. Jools Holland visited it while he was making a TV show called \"The Tube\". He loved Portmeirion so much that he used its type of architecture in building his recording studio and house in Blackheath.\nThe village is used in many movies and television shows to look like the shows are taking place in an exotic place in Europe. Episodes of \"Danger Man\", \"Doctor Who\", and \"The Prisoner\" have been filmed at Portmeirion. Many bands and musicians have recorded videos, songs, and held concerts there to do with \"The Prisoner\", including Supergrass, Iron Maiden, XTC, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and a music festival called Festival N\u00b06."}

The cattle were forced to swim through the dangerous water, with many of them often dying. If the cows survived the trip, they were sent to London and other places to be sold. \nAn engineer named Thomas Telford was working near Holyhead when he thought it would be a good idea to build a suspension bridge to Anglesey. A suspension bridge was big enough that tall ships could go underneath them. He asked the British Parliament if he could build the bridge and they said yes.\nTelford designed the bridge. They started building it in 1819. The first thing to be built were the towers that are on both sides at Holyhead and Anglesey. The towers were made out of limestone from Penmon. They were hollow inside. After the towers were built, 16 chains were installed. They were made out of 935 bars of iron. They were long enough to support the long bridge. Iron can rust. So, the people who made the chains soaked them in linseed oil and the painted. The chains were long and weighed 121 tons. The bridge opened on January 30, 1826.\nBridge improvements.\nThe road that went over the bridge was not very safe because of the strong winds. Workers made the bridge stronger in 1840. The bridge road was made of wood, and in 1893 it was replaced with steel. The bridge only allowed cars and trucks that weighted up to 4.5 tons to go over the bridge. This made it hard for big trucks to bring goods to the island. In 1938 they installed wrought iron chains to make the bridge strong. In 1999, the bridge closed for one month. The road was fixed and the bridge was made stronger. When it was closed, people had to drive over the Britannia Bridge to get to the island. \nOne part of the bridge was closed for six months starting on February 28, 2005. The bridge was painted for the first time in 65 years. It was reopened on December 11.\nSurroundings.\nThe Anglesey Coastal Path goes under the bridge. There is a memorial to the Aberfan disaster victims at the bridge on Anglesey.\nPopular culture.\nThe closest town to the bridge is called Menai Bridge. British one pound coins have drawings of the bridge. The coins were made in 2005. The bridge is mentioned in \"Through the Looking-Glass\" by Lewis Carroll. "}

The codice_1 function is the entry point of a D program, and codice_2 is an array of strings representing the command line arguments.

The plebians (plebs) were the free Roman people who were not patricians.\nThe tribunes provided a balance between the power of the Senate and the needs of the people. There were ten tribunes at any time, and they could act separately or together. \nThese tribunes had the power to use the People's Assembly (the Concilium Plebis) to support the common people. They could summon the Senate, propose legislation and intervene on the behalf of plebeians in legal matters. Most important of all was the power to veto the actions of the Consuls and other magistrates, to protect the interests of the plebeians. An assault on any plebian tribune was against the law.\nTribunes of the plebs were elected by the People's Assembly alone. They could be commoners, unlike all the other officials of the Roman Republic. Their role lasted for about 800 years, but under the Roman Empire they did not have real powers. They were in origin and style, a working part of the Roman Republic. \nAlthough a tribune could veto any action of the magistrates, Senate, or other assemblies, he had to be physically present in order to do so. Once the tribune was no longer present, the action could be completed as if the veto had not occurred. This meant that the tribunes' powers were limited to Rome itself, not the Republic in general."}

Meju is produced by drying a brick of soybeans. The brick of soybeans is naturally fermented while it dries. There are several ways to make a brick of soybeans. Traditionally, boiled soybeans were crushed in a mortar and made into a brick shape to be tied up with straw.\n\"Meju\" was commonly made in any Korean home in the past. Condiments made with mejus all tasted different because the production of meju was not standardized. As many Koreans now buy Korean traditional condiments instead of making them, it is difficult to find the wide variety of unique tasting condiments made from homemade meju.\nHistory.\nThe meaning of the word \u2018meju\u2019 originally included all condiments and seasonings made with meju. However, as another word \u2018jang\u2019 was used more frequently to refer to condiments made with meju, the meaning of the word \u2018meju\u2019 shifted to refer only to the stage before it is used in condiments.

In some cases, the sequence tends towards a limit, in which case the limit is denoted using the symbol formula_1 (as in formula_2), and the sequence is said to be convergent, otherwise it is divergent.\nIn a convergent sequence, the absolute difference between the value of the current term and the limit, formula_3, will decrease towards 0, as the sequence progresses. \nFormal Definition.\nWe call formula_4 the limit of the sequence formula_5 if the following condition holds:\nIn other words, for every measure of distance formula_10, we can find an infinite number of terms of the sequence that are closer than formula_10 to the limit. We say that the sequence formula_5 converges to or tends to the limit formula_4, which we write as formula_14 or formula_15. The limit can be also shown to be unique.\nIf a sequence converges to a limit, then it is convergent; otherwise it is divergent.\nHistory.\nThe Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea is famous for formulating paradoxes that involve limiting processes.\nLeucippus, Democritus, Antiphon, Eudoxus and Archimedes developed the method of exhaustion, which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a geometric series.\nNewton dealt with series in his works on \"Analysis with infinite series\" (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), \"Method of fluxions and infinite series\" (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and \"Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum\" (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his \"Optiks\"). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of (\"x\"+\"o\")\"n\", which he then linearizes by \"taking the limits\" as \"o\" tends to 0.\nIn the 18th century, mathematicians like Euler succeeded in summing some \"divergent\" series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, Lagrange in his \"Th\u00e9orie des fonctions analytiques\" (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus.

Hall, and it is related to an expectation theory in macroeconomics. This gives basis of how individuals do economic decision of present period and is used to calculate an amount of the macro consumption from an economic world.\nThis theory starts with Friedman's permanent income hypothesis and Lucas's rational expectation hypothesis. Before this theory was made, other expectation theories basically assume that people irrationally think sometimes making decision based on the past (already reflected in the market) facts or falling into the illusion. But Lucas argued that the market players use all the information available at the moment in order to pursuit utility maximization. Permanent income hypothesis supposes people try to decide the amount of consumption expecting the impacts of a certain incident throughout the whole periods of time.\nRandom walk hypothesis concludes rational expectation to consumption of the next period is the present consumption. It is because all the information was taken into account on the decision of the present consumption. What changes the amount of next period consumption is totally unexpected or not given information. Therefore, the changes in the consumption cannot be expected but randomly walk.\nExternal references.\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w2265"}

In Arabic it is often called \"Daesh\". It operates in Libya, Nigeria, Syria and a small part of northern Iraq. It is influenced by the Wahhabi Sect of Islam. It claims the status of independent state for the territories under its control in Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, and Syria. It is opposed to Shiism and has been described as \"Shiaphobic\".\nThe group was started in the early years of the Iraq War and associated itself with Al-Qaeda in 2004. ISIL was composed of different insurgent groups. Its aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni majority regions of Iraq, later expanding this to include Syria. In February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle, Al-Qaeda cut all ties with ISIL.\nISIL is millenarianist, meaning it believes that society is going to change a lot, and everything we know will end soon. The group recruits new members by promising them sex slaves or cheap marriages.\nFighting.\nAt the height of the Iraq War, ISIL was in the Iraqi provinces of Al Anbar, Ninawa, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad. It claimed Baqubah as its capital. In the ongoing Syrian Civil War, the group has a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqa, Idlib and Aleppo.\nThe group has attacked government and military targets. It has claimed responsibility for attacks that killed thousands of Iraqi civilians. During the time coalition forces were present in Iraq, the group suffered some setbacks. By 2012, it was thought to have regained most of its strength and more than doubled the number of its members to about 2,500.\nIn 2013, a letter and an audio recording of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was leaked to Al Jazeera. In it, al-Zawahiri disbanded the Syrian faction of ISIL. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, opposed this ruling on the basis of Islamic law. The group has since continued to operate in Syria. Starting in April 2013, it made rapid military gains in large parts of Northern Syria, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described them as \"the strongest group\". They have sought publicity by releasing videos of the decapitation (beheading) of journalists and other prisoners of war mainly done by member Jihadi John. He was killed in November 2015.\nWorldwide Caliphate.\nIn June 2014, it announced a worldwide caliphate. In 2014, ISIL successfully fought in a large-scale offensive in Iraq. After this offensive, ISIL is reported to have seized control of most of Mosul, the second biggest city in Iraq, its surrounding Nineveh province, and the city of Fallujah. In the spring of 2015 ISIL fought for control of Tikrit, the administrative center of the Salah ad Din Governorate.\nIn spring of 2016 the Army of Iraq took back Fallujah. At the end of 2016 the army took back Ramadi in Al Anbar Province, and in early 2017 Iraqi government forces retook Mosul.

Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture started his military career as a leader of the 1791 slave rebellion in Saint-Domingue, which was a French colony. When he did this he was a free black man (not a slave). Toussaint gradually took control over the whole island (also the Spanish part called Santo Domingo). When he had power for years, he tried to improve the security and economy on Saint-Domingue. He also restored the plantation system, by using paid workers. Besides of all this, he had a very large army.\nEarly life.\nLittle is known for sure about Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture\u2019s early life, because sources disagree. The first records of his life were from his son, Isaac L\u2019Ouverture. Most histories say Toussaint\u2019s father was Gaou Guinou, who was a son of King Arrada. King Arrada, also called Great Arrada, was the king of what is now Benin. His mother was Gaou Guinou\u2019s second wife.\nMost sources tell us that Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture was born on the plantation of Br\u00e9da at Haute de Cap in Saint Domingue. His birthdate is unknown. All Saints' Day is likely, because his name \"Toussaint\" means \"all saints'\" in French. When the Haitian Revolution started he was probably about 50 years old. Different sources give birth dates from 1739 until 1746. When he was a child he was small and weak. But as an adult he was known by his great stamina and horse-riding skills.\nEducation.\nMost sources tell us that Toussaint was well-educated by his godfather, Pierre Baptiste. By age 20 he could speak three languages, French, Creole and some Latin. He also had a knowledge of medicinal plants.\nMarriage and children.\nToussaint married Suzanne Simone Baptiste in 1782. Suzanne was probably his cousin. People think that he had 16 children, and that 11 of them had already died before he did himself. His oldest son was adopted. The two sons born out of his marriage with Suzanne were Isaac and Saint-Jean.\nSlavery, freedom and working life.\nToussaint was known for being a slave until the start of the Revolution. He was free at the age of 33.\nWhen he was free, he became wealthier and began to have more property. He made a good amount of money in the Revolution and he was the owner of several properties.\nReligion and spirituality.\nDuring his life Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture was considered to be a Roman Catholic. The Vodou spirituality was also often used on the Br\u00e9da plantation. It was combined with Catholicism. It is not known if Toussaint had anything to do with these religions and spiritualties. When he was the ruler of Saint-Domingue, he said he did not.\nL'ouverture was a Freemason. The historians thought this, because he used a Masonic symbol in his signature.\nHaitian revolution.\nSaint-Domingue (later Haiti) was the world's biggest sugar producer and provided sugar for many countries. It had more than 800 sugar plantations. With a few rich families and 500,000 African slaves on Haiti, the slaves totally outnumbered everyone else. To stop the slaves from revolting and taking the power, the French people used terrible methods to keep the slaves powerless.\nThe Haitian Revolution began when the French people who owned the plantations wanted independence. But the slaves wanted something else; they wanted freedom. In 1791, about 100,00 slaves revolted. They burned all the sugarcane in the fields and killed hundreds of slave owners. In this early stage, Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture did not join yet. But after some weeks, he took his family to the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo to keep them safe and helped the supervisors of the plantation of Br\u00e9da to leave the island, if we believe surviving documents.\nToussaint L\u2019Ouverture was one of the leaders of the rebellion. He took part in talks about strategy. He had contact with the Spanish people who supported the rebellion, because they provided food to the slaves who were in revolt. In 1801 he moved to Santo Domingo and took control of the territory. He freed the slaves and wrote a constitution for Santo Domingo.\nWhen Napoleon Bonaparte took power in France, he took back the rich sugar plantations on Saint-Domingue. In January of the year 1802, French soldiers landed in Saint-Domingue in order to get rid of Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. When Napoleon Bonaparte told Toussaint that he wanted Saint-Domingue back, Toussaint said that he would get it back if he would end slavery on Saint-Domingue forever. Napoleon agreed and took Toussaint with him to Paris to discuss the deal further.\nDespite the deal, the French people later accused L'Ouverture of planning another revolt against the plantation owners. He was sent to jail in the French Alps. The jail was called Fort-de-Joux. Ten months after he was sent to jail, on the 7th of April 1803, Toussaint died.\nAfter his death, slavery in Haiti was started again, but was never to be the same. Toussaint had left an impression about slavery, and the slaves continued to fight the rich French plantation owners in a brutal way. This resulted in another revolution. Toussaint\u2019s General, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, took up Toussaint's job in the revolution after he died. Dessalines became the first Emperor of Haiti. Later in the revolt he was attacked and he died.\nBut before Dessalines died, yellow fever killed thousands of French people trying to calm the revolt in Haiti. On January 1, 1804, Saint-Domingue was renamed Haiti and was declared independent by Dessalines. In this way, Haiti became the first black republic in the world, and the first colony to free itself from European rule."}

Anna Strunsky was inspired by Sheldon's work.\nEarly life.\nMary Downing Sheldon was born in Oswego, New York. She had four siblings. She was the oldest of them all. Her mother was named Frances Stiles. Her father was Edward Austin Sheldon. Her father founded Oswego State Normal and Training School. Sheldon would go to school there. She graduated in 1869. She worked there as a teacher for two years. She then went to school at the University of Michigan. She graduated in 1876 with a degree in classics. She went back to Oswego State Normal and Training School where she taught for two years. She taught history, Latin, botany, and Greek. She stopped work at Oswego and started working at Wellesley College in 1876. She worked there for two and a half years. She used case methods in her teaching. She quit working there in 1879 because she was sick and also had problems with the people who worked there. After she quit, she relaxed so she would feel better, and then traveled for fun. In 1882, she went back to work at Oswego. She wrote a book while she was there, called \"Studies in General History\". It was published in 1885.\nTeaching and writing career.\nOn August 6, 1885, Sheldon got married. She married a man named Earl Barnes. She met him when he was a student of hers, and he was 11 years younger than her. He became the head of the education department at Stanford University in 1981. Sheldon moved with him and also worked at Stanford. She researched and taught classes about the History of Europe and the Pacific Slope areas. Sheldon and Barnes wrote a book together in 1891. It was called \"Studies in American History.\" They also wrote another book in 1896, together. She wrote another book of her own, too. It was called \"Studies of Historical Method,\" and taught readers about historical method. In 1897, Sheldon and Barnes quit working at Stanford. They traveled to Europe and wrote while they were there.\nDeath and afterwards.\nOn August 27, 1898, Sheldon died of heart disease in London. The teaching and writing that she did about research and historical method is considered ahead of its time. The work that she did helped improve history textbooks that are used today. In 1985 and 1986, papers, writings and other materials owned by Sheldon and Barnes were donated to the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College by Betty Barnes, the daughter-in-law of Earl Barnes, and his second wife, Anna Koehler Barnes."}

Since the theme park was purchased by Cedar Fair, the number of people who visited the park has increased. According to the 2013 Global Attractions Attendance Report, Knott's Berry Farm is the 13th most visited theme park in North America. The park has 40 rides, including roller coasters, family rides, children's rides, water rides, and historical rides, and there are plans to make the park bigger in the future.\nThe theme park sits on what used to be a berry farm that was built by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Starting around 1920, the family started selling berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along a highway. In 1934, the Knotts started selling fried chicken dinners inside a tea room that is on the farm. They later built shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. In 1940, Walter Knott built a ghost town on the farm, and added other attractions over many years. In 1968, Knott's Berry Farm started to charge people to visit the park. In 1983, the park added Camp Snoopy.\nIn the 1990s, the Knott children sold the family business after Walter and Cordelia Knott died. The theme park was sold to and the food business was sold to ConAgra Foods, which was later sold to The J.M. Smucker Company.\nCedar Fair continued to make the park bigger in 1999 by adding Knott's Soak City. They also added more rides to Knott's Berry Farm.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a \"summer-long county fair\". In 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. On April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died, and Walter turned his attention toward political causes.\nSky Tower was built to support two attractions, the Parachute Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin. Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders looking forward to the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that is surrounded behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing view.. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is not allowed during the trip. During winds 25\u00a0mph+ or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction now held by nearby WindSeeker.) The illuminated \"K\" in logo script atop the Sky Tower was designated a landmark which prevented Knott's plan of changing the foundation to support WindSeeker.\nCorkscrew debuted in 1975 as the first modern-day roller coaster to perform a 360-degree inverting element, twice. It was designed by Arrow Development. Corkscrew is still operating to this day, but was sold and moved in 1989 to Silverwood in Athol, Idaho. Montezooma's Revenge was later opened in 1978 and remains in operation at Knott's Berry Farm."}

He served as President of Argentina from 22 December 1981 to 18 June 1982. This was during the last military dictatorship (known officially as the National Reorganization Process). He was removed from power soon after the British retook the Falkland Islands, whose invasion he had ordered.\nEarly life.\nGaltieri was born in the Buenos Aires area. He entered the Argentine Army, and studied engineering. He was a skilled engineer, and he rose quickly through the ranks of the Argentine military. In 1975, he became the head of the Engineering Corps of the army. \nWhen Jorge Rafael Videla took power a year later, Galtieri supported him. Videla was a brutal dictator, and thousands of people were murdered under his rule. \nPresidency.\nIn 1981, Videla stepped down. Galtieri took power late that year after removing Roberto Viola in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Although not as brutal as Videla, he continued the \"Dirty War.\"\nThe United States supported Galtieri. He was a strong anti-communist. Because of this, the United States saw Argentina as an ally against the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\nSoon after Galtieri took power, the Argentine economy was about to fall apart. Inflation, the rate at which new money is put into the economy, was as high as 130%. Unemployment was very high, and the state oil company lost six billion dollars in a matter of months. This is the worst loss of money any corporation has had in all of history. \nGaltieri allowed people to disagree with him more than the leaders who came before him. Protests against his dictatorship became common.\nInvasion of the Falkland Islands.\nBy 1982, Galtieri's popularity was low. He wanted more people to support him. He also wanted to increase Argentine patriotism. For many years, Argentina had said the Falkland Islands (a British territory) was actually theirs. The British did not see Argentina as a war threat, and didn't heavily defend the islands. \nWith Jorge Anaya, one of the other members of the junta, Galtieri thought of a plan to take over the islands. Galtieri ordered the Argentine military to invade the islands. After bombarding the capital city, Port Stanley, Argentina forced the British Governor of the islands, Rex Hunt, to surrender.\nGaltieri became very popular after the invasion, and huge celebrations were held in Buenos Aires. His regime seemed to be very strong. But Galtieri had badly misread what British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would do. He also believed he would have the support of the United States. However, the United States (and most of the world) supported Britain. \nThe British sent their armed forces to the islands. After heavy fighting, the British defeated Argentina in June. Within days, the Argentine army turned on Galtieri, and he was removed from power.\nAfter the Presidency.\nAfterwards, Galtieri was put on trial for crimes against humanity. Although one report wanted him to be executed, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In 1989, he was pardoned. \nAfter leaving prison, Galtieri lived in a suburb of Buenos Aires. Never a rich man, he lived modestly for the rest of his life. Galtieri died from a heart attack caused by surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his pancreas. He was 76 years old. \nToday, Galtieri is commonly viewed as a very incompetent dictator. He is often blamed for Argentina losing the Falklands War."}

They are responsible for the public safety. They act like police for the citizens of France. It also contains a military police force and a special forces component, the GIGN. In 2011 more than 98,155 people were working for the National Gendarmerie in France.\nWhat do they do?\nThe Gendarmerie works together with the other national law enforcement agency, the Police Nationale. And since 2009, even though this force is a part of the armed forces establishment, it belonged to the Ministry of the Interior as its military component and it is part of its operations and the budget. They fulfill national security duties and duties in support of their ministry. \nThey are also responsible for road patrols. The police can stop drivers. When they do so, it is called a contr\u00f4le. They can ask for a driver's identification papers and car papers at any time. \nTheir weapon quote is Gendarmerie, une force humaine. This literally means \"Gendarmerie, a human armed force.\"\nUniforms and armor.\nThe name \"Gendarmerie\" comes from \"gens d\u2019arme,\" which means \"armed people.\" This military corp has an exploding grenade as its logo. Instead of metal medals, Gendarmes wear ribbons. These are called b\u00e2tons. They get ribbons, inter alia, for service abroad. \nSince a few years ago, the Gendarmes' flat hat, called a k\u00e9pi, has only been used for special occasions. \nThe French did not have a uniform until the late 17th century, though some companies had recognizable coat colors. Light grey was common, but red and blue were also worn. It was said that the French in the 17th century had an addiction to bows, ribbons, and plumes, which was suitable to the future leaders of European fashion. Guard Gendarmes probably had red coats. Many guard troops wore the royal badge on their back and their breast. In the 16th century, national signs were that they wore a white cross on their back and on their breast. In the 17th century this became a white sash. \nNowadays the Gendarmerie uses bulletproof and tactical vests and body armour. A anti-riot shield is used during a heavier riot. They also make use of the spectra helmet. This spectra helmet is fitted with a visor for extra protection of the face. If a tear gas is used, the operators use a special gas mask, which protects them from the dangerous gasses. They also have apparatus for throwing tear gas canisters and FAMAS riffles. This is a sort of weapon. This equipment helps protect Gendarmes while they are doing their jobs.\nDepartments.\n\"Departmental Gendarmerie\".\nThis is the territorial police branch of the Gendarmerie. It is the branch that is most similar to France\u2019s common police. It has regular contact with France\u2019s population and does jobs similar to the Police of France. The Departmental Gendarmerie is divided into Brigades consisting of 6 to 40 operators. A brigade performs observation and may give assistance to citizens in regulated periods, during both daytime and nighttime.\n\"Mobile Gendarmerie\".\nThe Mobile Gendarmerie has several tasks, which include riot control, security of significant places (like embassies), conducting OPEX (External Operations), and providing support to the Departmental Gendarmerie. It is divided into 25 legions, including one advanced armoured anti-riot police group. The Mobile Gendarmerie has control over the GIGN, the counter-terrorism part of the Gendarmerie Nationale.\n\"GIGN (National Gendarmerie Intervention Group)\".\nThe GIGN members are well trained to conduct special operations such as hostage rescue. They are also trained in maritime anti-terrorism operations. They are trained to conduct operations with no risk to the public and the hostages. \n\"Republican Guard\".\nA ceremonial unit that takes part in parades and secures important locations in a formal way.\n\"Maritime Gendarmerie\".\nSupervised by the Gendarmerie and the French Navy, the Maritime Gendarmerie conducts maritime surveillance, assistance and rescue at sea; police security at naval bases; and police at sea. They do these jobs not only in France, but also in other countries like French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and others.\n\"Air transport Gendarmerie\".\nThe air transport gendarmerie is similar to the Gendarmerie de L\u2019air. The Gendarmerie de L\u2019air conducts safety operations in air force bases and goes to accidents involving military aircraft. Its missions include securing civilian airports, surveillance of technical things in the airport (like control towers), traffic control on the roads near airports, and making sure that important visitors are safe and well protected at airports.\nTransport.\n\"Departmental gendarmerie\".\n-Subaru Impreza WRX STI (In use until 2011)\n-Renault Megane RS (In use since 2011 and on)\n-BMW R1100RT Motorcycle\n-IVECO Daily van\n-Renault Trafic van\n-Many other cars, like the Ford Focus and Transit.\n\"Mobile Gendarmerie\".\n-VXB VBRG Armored Personnel Carrier\n-VBC-90 Armoured Combat Vehicle\n\"Gendarmerie de l\u2019Air &amp; Air transport gendarmerie\".\n-Eurocopter EC145 Helicopter\n\"Maritime Gendarmerie\".\n-1 Trident class Patrol boat\n-2 G\u00e9ranium class Patrol Boats\n-2 Jonquille class Patrol Boats\n-24 Vedette class Small Patrol boats\n-2 P\u00e9tulante class Small Patrol Crafts\n-8 Pavois Class Small Patrol Craft\n\"GIGN\".\n-Height Adjustible Rescue Assault System (HARAS): Based on a Chevrolet Suburban.\n\"The GIGN makes use of the helicopters belonging to the French Air Force.\"\n- 5 A\u00e9rospatiale AS532 Cougar Helicopter\n- 2 Sud-Aviation SA330 Puma Helicopter\n- 9 Eurocopter EC725 Caracal\n- 1 Eurocopter EC665 Tigre\n\"Republican Guard\".\n-Horses\nWeapons.\n\"Departmental Gendarmerie\".\n-SIG Sauer P226 Pistol \n\"Mobile Gendarmerie\".\n-FAMAS Bullpup Assault Rifle\n-Sig-Sauer P226\n-Tear gas launcher\n-T-Style Baton\n\" GIGN \".\n\"Pistols:\"\n-Manurhin MR 73 \n-Glock 19\n-S&amp;W 686\n-Sig-Sauer P228\n-FN Five-Seven\n-Giat PAMAS G1\n-Sig-Sauer Pro SP 2022\n-X26 Taser\n\"Shotguns:\"\n-Remington 870\n-Benelli M3 Super 90\n-Franchi SPAS 12\n\"Sub-machine Guns: \"\n-HK MP5\n-FN P90\n\"Assault Rifles:\"\n-HK G3 TGS\n-SIG-550\n-SIG-551\n-HK33\n-FAMAS F1\n-HK G36\n-HK 416\n\"Marksman weapons:\"\n-MR-73\n-AW .338\n-PGM Hecate II\n\" Republican Guard \".\n-FAMAS F1\n-Swords"}

It is made from steamed white rice (bap) and various other ingredients. It is wrapped by gim (sheets of dried laver seaweed) in a triangle shape. The plastic wrapping is folded between the gim and rice. People can make it by themselves but usually they purchase it at a convenience store. They tend to eat it to replace their meals. A refrigerator shelf life is within 1 day. Convenience stores have various kinds of triangular gimbap. The price range is from 700 won to 900 won.\nHistory.\nTriangular gimbap was first made in Japan. At first, the name was Onigiri. It was ball-shaped and made to serve quick meals during war. Triangular gimbap was introduced to Korea during the 1990s. In 1991, 7-Eleven began to sell it. Family Mart and GS25 followed it. Nowadays, there are various flavors and types of triangular gimbap: tuna with mayonnaise, Jeonju bibimbap, bulgogi, spicy tuna, cheese spicy chicken, and so on.\nFlaws.\nTriangular gimbap is very convenient. It is easy to replace meals with it. However, it has a few side effects that are harmful to people's health. The amount of sodium and fat it contains is near the Daily Reference Value. The nutrients it contains are 20~30% of the amount a person needs to take a day. Also, synthetic preservative was found. It was revealed that several food additives are added to it because the main resource, rice, is at least 2-3 years old and manufacturers added artificial flavor enhancer to remove rice smell and bleach to make the rice whiter."}
{"id": "454495", "revid": "1095681", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454495", "title": "Casting (fishing)", "text": "In fishing, casting is the act of throwing bait or a lure using a fishing rod, reel, and line. Several types of rod and reels are designed just for casting. The method of casting can vary but in each case the object of casting is to get the bait or lure to where the fish are. \nBasic methods.\nThe most accurate type of cast is the 'overhead cast'. The angler raises the rod (and reel) back behind the head, then quickly flicks the rod forward, releasing the line as the cast is completed. The 'side cast' is less forceful but easier to learn. The rod is swung back in a horizontal motion then quickly moved forward releasing the line. Both basic methods have variations. But both are popular when using spinning and casting rods. Fly fishing uses similar movements, but the line release is different. All types of rods and reels need to match the weight rating of the rod, reel, line and lure for best performance. \nSpinning rods &amp; reels.\nAnyone can learn to cast a lure with a spinning rod and reel in just a few minutes. Two types of spinning reels, open faced and close faced. They work differently. With a closed face reel a push-button is held down and released at the end of the cast. Open face reels require the angler to first open the bail, then hold and release the line with your forefinger as you cast. Open faced reels have a disadvantage when casting short distances. Short casts causes the line to twist. This in turn causes line tangles on the spool. Spinning rods and reels work best using light line and light lures. Spinning reels have an advantage over casting reels when casting into the wind.\nBait casting rods &amp; reels.\nBait casting (also called \"baitcasting\") reels come in different sizes and capacities. Depending on use, they also can have different features. The common feature is a horizontal spool that the line winds onto. Casting reels usually have better control of the line and lure. They have better accuracy than other types. Bait casting reels are better at handling heavier line and lures. But there is a to become skilled with a bait casting rod and reel. To cast a bait casting reel, a push-button is pressed and held until you want to release the line. Bait casting reels have a tendency to 'snarl' or 'backlash'. This is because during the cast the line is coming off the reel at a high rate of speed. When the lure hits the water the line stops. But the spool on the reel keeps turning, causing the line to snarl up. This is even more so when casting into the wind. Practice with bait casting reels minimizes this problem. To control snarling, bait casting reels usually have a brake. This automatically stops the spool when the line stops. Reels have either a magnetic brake control or a centrifugal brake control. Some have both. These must be adjusted to balance between good distance in casting and preventing backlash. Many anglers set the brake lightly to allow more distance. Then they control the braking with their thumb on the spool. Low-profile bait casting reels are designed especially for using the thumb.\nFlipping and pitching.\nAmong the specialized types of casts with a bait casting rod are two made popular by tournament fishermen:\n&lt;br&gt;\nFly rods &amp; reels.\nFly fishermen use artificial flies as a lure. Most flies have almost no weight and by themselves could not be cast with other types of rods and reels. The fly rod works because it uses a much heavier line than the other types. It is the line that is being cast. The fly simply goes where the line goes. Fly casting looks more difficult than it is. In less than a couple of hours most beginners can learn the basic cast. Fly casting is more involved than other types of casting. There are fly fishing schools that teach fly casting. \nTo cast a fly rod, the angler pulls several feet of line off the reel. The rod tip is moved back then in a fluid motion and accelerating, it is moved forward as the line is released. In fishing streams and rivers, trees and shrubs on the bank may prevent an overhead cast. Another type of cast is the 'roll cast'. Using the rod tip the fisherman forces the rod tip down to roll the line forward. Most fly lines are rated by a weight system. A 1wt (one weight) is very light while a 13wt is very heavy. It would be suitable for large salt water fish. Rods (and reels) are rated by the weight of the line they are designed for. Unfortunately there is no one size for all kinds of fish and fishing situations.\nNet casting.\nThe term may also be used for casting a net. The net is cast (thrown) by hand so that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught in the net and it is hauled back in. Net casting is often used to catch fish for bait. Modern cast nets have a radius of from 4 to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.6 metres). A larger net full of fish may take more than one person to pull it in. Cast nets also sometimes use a 'net thrower' device. This helps spin the net as its thrown, keeping it open. Cast nets work best in shallow water.\nCompetitive casting.\nCasting (known as Casting Sport) is also a sport. The sport is supervised by the International Casting Sport Federation (ICSF). As of April 2014 are in 31 countries.\nCasting competitions were active in England and the United States in the later 1800s. In 1881 the first tournament was held just outside of London. In 1955, 14 different national associations started the ICF (now ICSF). The ICSF sets all international standards for the sport. It sponsors tournaments. It also recognizes world records for accuracy and distance. This sport uses plastic weights or hookless flies. Competitions can be held on water or on athletic fields. There are competitive divisions for almost all types of fly, fixed spool and revolving spool tackle, and competitor classes. Competitive casting is part of the World Games.\nWorld Championship in 2014 are to be held in Szamotuly (Poland), from 3 to 7 September."}

A sign in town says that Rangeley is halfway between the Equator and the North Pole.\nHistory.\nRangeley is named after an English settler, Squire James Rangeley. He had a 31,000 acre piece of land that was bought in 1796 by his father. He came in 1825 to build the town. He built a sawmill, a gristmill, a mansion, and a ten-mile road to get to other towns.\nThe Phillips and Rangeley railroad opened in 1891 and tourists from Boston; Hartford; New York; and Philadelphia started to come. In the early 1900s, Rangeley became a summer resort area with camps, cabins, summer homes, and hotels. The cool mountain climate and plenty of sport fishing make this a likeable town.\nSome local people became fishing guides for visitors. Among the fishermen was President Herbert Hoover. The big hotels went away during World War II. The Rangeley Lake House was torn down in 1958. New hotels have taken their place, so Rangeley remains popular.\nNotable people.\nOne of many famous people who lives in Rangeley is Kurt Russell, the movie star. He quietly owns a home in the mountains here. He is locally called by the name \"Snake Plisskin\". His father, the actor Bing Russell, was a native of Rangeley.\nWilhelm Reich, a well-known Austrian-American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst made his home in Rangeley during his later years. He took over a large estate () and named it Orgonon. It became his home, laboratory and research center. Reich is buried here on the grounds. It is now open to the public as the Wilhelm Reich Museum, with rental cottages available."}

It is the largest member of the Esox (Pike) family. The muskellunge is also called the muskie or maskinonge (Canada). It is native to northern and eastern North America. Muskies have been introduced into other U.S. states.. Muskies are carnivorous and eat other fish. They are ambush feeders who will attack anything that moves in or on the water.\nSubspecies.\nCurrently there are three recognized subspecies of Muskellunge.\nThere is also a hybrid called the Tiger muskellunge (or Tiger Muskie). It is a cross between the Muskellunge and the Northern pike (\"Esox lucius\"). They are smaller than true muskies but can grow up to 1.5 times faster in the first year. They are almost always sterile and cannot reproduce.\nPhysical descriptions.\nTrue muskies have light colored bodies. They can be silver, light green, or light brown. They usually have dark bars on their sides. This is the opposite of the Northern pike which Muskies are sometimes confused with. Northern pike (northerns) have dark bodies with light colored bars on the sides. Muskies also have scales only on the upper half of the cheek. The best way to tell the two apart is the pores under the jaw. Northerns have five or less; muskies have six or more. Males are always smaller than females.\nTiger muskies look like both muskies and northerns. Their \"tiger\" stripes are more distinctive than the true musky. Where both species live in the same waters, tiger muskies occur naturally. But they are never in large numbers. Once biologists realized that tiger muskies were a hybrid, they began raising them in hatcheries. There are no size differences between male and female tiger muskies.\nHabitat and forage.\nThe muskie is a very efficient predator. It lays in wait near the shoreline often in shallow water. It hides in weeds, near or under logs and rocks. In the summer as the water warms up, Muskies move to the cooler waters at lower depths. But will remain close to shallow water using drop-offs for cover. Muskies can stand water up to 90 degrees F.\nMuskies forage (feed) mainly on other fish such as suckers and perch. They are ambush feeders who will nearly anything. They have been known to eat Loons, ducks and small mammals like Muskrats.\nWhen the water temperature reaches 60\u00a0\u00b0F, muskies feed heavily. At 80\u00b0 the feeding slows down. They have a preference for larger fish over small fish. Muskies strike quickly. They often take their prey to a secluded area before eating it. They remain in the same area of a lake, sometimes for their entire lifetime.\nBehavior.\nMuskies are one of the largest freshwater fish in North America. The largest on record was 69 pounds, 15 ounces. Average muskies are usually less than 40 inches long and might weigh from 7 to 15 pounds. Muskies can live up to 30 years.\nJust after the ice melts on northern lakes (called ice-out) and the water temperature is between 49\u00b0 and 59\u00b0F, muskies begin to spawn. In lakes where both northern pike and muskies live, muskies spawn after the northerns. A female lays between 60,000 and 100,000 eggs. In lakes with northern pike and muskies, the muskie seems to have fewer numbers of surviving fry. Two reasons are suggested. Since northerns hatch about two weeks earlier than muskies, the young northerns feed on the smaller muskie fry. Another reason is that the young muskie fry swim just below the surface of the water. They are easily seen by fish below or birds flying over the water.\nAngling.\nMuskies are an elusive fish but highly prized by anglers. Many fishermen specialize in muskie fishing and will fish for no other species. They are called \"the fish of 10,000 casts\". This gives some idea of how difficult they are to catch. According to many guides, muskies do not fear anything, including fisherman. They routinely follow lures back to the boat without striking. Sometimes they will flick a lure or fly back at the fisherman. Hooking a muskie is hard. Landing one is even harder. They will fight hard for short periods and should be landed quickly to avoid stressing them. Prolonged fighting of muskie on insufficient tackle could kill them even after they swim away. Skill and luck are needed to land one.\nMuskies require very careful handling by anglers. A trophy size musky is an old fish. A 30-pound female may be 17 years old. If taken as a trophy they are not easily replaced. For that reason catch and release is strongly recommended. A musky may still fight being handled. They are large powerful fish with very sharp teeth. The mortality rate can be very high for fish that are handled carelessly."}

These may span between several hundred million light-years to 10 billion light-years, and cover more than 5% of the observable universe. Superclusters suggest something about the initial condition of the universe when these superclusters were formed. The directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within superclusters may also tell us about the formation of galaxies early in the history of the Universe.\nInside superclusters are large voids of space in which few galaxies exist.

The executive branch is mostly about the President and is independent of the legislature. Legislative power is in the two chambers of Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives.\nThe judicial branch (or judiciary), made of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, focuses on the judicial power (or judiciary). The judiciary's main focus is to interpret the meaning of the United States Constitution and federal laws and rules. This includes solving problems between the executive and legislative branches.\nPolitical parties.\nTwo political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have been the main participants in American politics since the American Civil War. There are also smaller parties like the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, and the Constitution Party. The Whig Party, the Federalist Party, and the Democratic-Republican Party were important many years ago. \nPolitical differences.\nThere are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed democracies. These include greater power in the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the Supreme Court, the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive, and the dominance of only two main parties. Third parties have less political influence in the United States than in other developed country democracies.\nThe federal object created by the U.S. Constitution is the main feature of the American governmental system. However, most people are also subject to a state government, and all are subject to various units of local government. The latter include counties, municipalities, and special districts.\nThe federal government was created by the states, which as colonies were established separately and governed themselves independently of the others. Units of local government were created by the colonies to carry out various state functions. As the country expanded, it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones.\nState leaders.\nThe USA is a federal union of fifty states. They have governors and legislatures to govern and make their laws. Each state also has two senators who represent their state in the United States Senate. There are also representatives who represent their local district in the United States House of Representatives.\nPresident of the United States.\nThe President of the United States is the head of state of the United States.

The Solar System is one of these. It is now clear that many other stars have planetary systems.\nThe 21st century has become a golden era of planetary system discovery. 4,801 such exoplanets in 3552 planetary systems have been discovered, including 789 multiplanet systems. Hundreds more systems are unconfirmed. \nThe closest confirmed system is Gliese 832 at 14.8 light years (ly) with one confirmed planet.The closest unconfirmed system is Alpha Centauri at 4.37 ly with a planet of Earth mass. The closest multi-planet system is Gliese 876 at 15.3 ly with four confirmed planets.\nOf particular interest to astrobiology is the habitable zone of planetary systems. This is thought to be the region with the most potential to develop extraterrestrial life.\nMultiplanetary systems.\nMultiplanetary systems are stars with at least two confirmed planets, beyond our Solar System.\nFrom the total of 1116 stars known to have exoplanets (as of June 2014, there are a total of 461 known multiplanetary systems. About 280 of these have only two confirmed exoplanets, but some have more. The star with the most confirmed planets is our Sun with 8 confirmed planets, while the stars with the most confirmed exoplanets are Kepler-90 and HD 10180 with 7 confirmed planets each; in 2012, two more exoplanet candidates have been suggested for HD 10180, which would bring the total to 9 exoplanets in that system.\nGliese 876, with 4 confirmed exoplanets, is the closest multiplanetary system at 15 light years from our Solar System. A total of 12 systems are known that are closer than 50 light years away, but most are much farther away. The farthest confirmed multiplanetary system is OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L, at 13300 ly away.\nThe two most important stellar properties are mass and metallicity because it determines how these planetary systems form. The higher mass and metallicity tend to have more planets and more massive planets."}

{"id": "454838", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454838", "title": "Rhyme scheme", "text": "A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyme between lines of a poem or song. People usually use letters to show which lines rhyme with which other lines. For example, in a poem that is ABAB, the first and third lines rhyme with each other and the second and fourth lines rhyme with each other. The most basic rhyme schemes are AA, AAA, AABB, ABAB and ABBA. There are also more complicated schemes, such as ABABBCC (rhyme royal), ABABABCC (ottava rima) or ABABBBCBCC (Spenserian stanza). Sonnets may have very different rhyme schemes, Italian (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD, ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, ABBA ABBA CDE EDC), French (ABBA ABBA CDCD EE), Spenserian (ABAB BCBC CDCD EE) or Shakesperian (ABAB CDCD EFEF GG).\nSometimes there are also internal rhymes. In the following strophe from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" there are rhymes and alliteration:\nSome schemes are common, the other are used very rarely. The scheme AABBCC is simple and can be found everywhere, but the scheme ABCCBA, used by Robert Browning in the \"Meeting at Night\", was never popular:\nThere are many possibilities for rhyme scheme. Five-line stanzas can have any of ten schemes with two different rhymes: AAABB, AABAB, AABBA, ABBAA, ABABA, ABAAB, AABBB, ABABB, ABBAB, ABBBA. Another possibility is of course AAAAA.\nNotice that two or three rhymes can be linked to each other by repeating the same vowel. The rhyme scheme of Giambattista Marino's poem \"Adone\" is ABABABCC (ottava rima), but in this strophe all rhymes are based on the vowel [i]. This feature shows up in Italian text but not in other languages:\nA a poet, period of time, or type of poetry can have a preferred rhyme scheme. For example, the Scottish poet Robert Burns preferred the scheme AAABAB. Rhyme royal, ABABBCC, was common in medieval English poetry. Ottava rima was typical of epic poems. Many great epic poems were written in Italian, Spanish or Portuguese with ABABABCC scheme."}

It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about 5,000\u00a0K, giving it an orange hue.\nIts planet, Epsilon Eridani b, was announced in 2000. The planet orbits in about 7 years. It is about 3.4 astronomical units (AU) away from its star. \nThe system includes two belts of rocky asteroids: one at about 3\u00a0AU and a second at about 20\u00a0AU, whose structure may be maintained by a hypothetical second planet, Epsilon Eridani c. Epsilon Eridani has an extensive outer debris disk of remnant planetesimals left over from the system's formation.\nEpsilon Eridani may be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that share a similar motion through the Milky Way. This suggests they share a common origin in an open star cluster. Its nearest neighbor, the binary star system Luyten 726-8, will have a close encounter with Epsilon Eridani in about 31,500\u00a0years when they will be separated by about 0.93\u00a0ly. \nEpsilon Eridani has been the target of SETI searches. Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel."}

A large number of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a \"star cluster\" but, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies.\nA stellar system of two stars is known as a \"binary star\", \"binary star system\" or \"physical double star\". If there are no tidal effects, no disturbance from other forces, and no transfer of mass from one star to the other, such a system is stable. Both stars will orbit around the center of mass of the system indefinitely. Examples of binary systems are Sirius, Procyon and Cygnus X-1, the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole.\nMultiple star systems.\nIt is possible to have star systems with more than two members. Their stars are gravitationally bound to each other, and may or may not be close to each other.\nA recently discovered quintuple star system (five stars) is known as 1SWASP J093010.78+533859.5. The system has two sets of binary stars, one of them with a small third star. The two sets are a long way apart, further than the orbit of Pluto is to the Sun. The binary stars are close to each other and one binary has touching stars, with their outer ionised gases mixing. That situation is called a contact binary. From the data collected, the authors are fairly sure that both binaries (and probably all five stars) are gravitationally bound in a single system. The angles of inclination (the angle between the two orbital planes) of the two binaries (88.2(3) and 86(4) degrees). This suggests they originally formed by break-up (~9-10 billion years ago ago) from a single protostellar disk. Afterwards, they stayed in the same orbital plane.\nMost multiple star systems are \"triple stars\". Systems with four or more components are less likely to occur.\nMultiple star systems are smaller than open star clusters, which have more complex dynamics and typically have from 100 to 1,000 stars. Most multiple star systems known are triple. For example, in the 1999 revision of\nTokovinin's catalog of physical multiple stars,\n551 out of the 728 systems described are triple.\nMultiple-star systems can be divided into two main types: systems which are stable, or systems with chaotic behavior. Chaotic ones are usually of young stars in systems not yet disrupted by chaos."}

They have roughly the same age, and were formed from the same giant molecular cloud.\nMore than 1,100 open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy, and many more are thought to exist. They are loosely bound together by mutual gravitational attraction, but they get disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas. Open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years, with the most massive ones surviving for a few billion years.\nIn contrast, the more massive globular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members. So, they can survive for longer. Open clusters have been found only in spiral and irregular galaxies, in which active star formation is occurring.\nYoung open clusters may still be in the molecular cloud from which they formed. They light it up and create an H II region. Over time, radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud. Typically, about 10% of the mass of a gas cloud will form stars before radiation pressure drives the rest of the gas away.\nOpen clusters are key objects in the study of stellar evolution. The cluster members are of similar age and chemical composition, so their properties (such as distance, age and chemical composition) are more easily studied than for isolated stars. A number of open clusters, such as the Pleiades, Hyades or the Alpha Persei Cluster are visible with the naked eye."}

The Chain pickerel is a freshwater game fish and the smallest member of the Esox (pike) family. They are native to Atlantic and Gulf Coast tributaries. Chain pickerel have been introduced into the Lakes Ontario and Erie drainages as well as other places. They are found in shallow weedy pools of lakes, streams and tidal and non-tidal rivers. They are ambush feeders who will strike at anything that swims near them. They feed mainly during daylight hours.\nPhysical description.\nChain pickerel has the same torpedo-like shape of the Muskellunge and Northern pike. They have different markings than either of their family members. They have a chain-like pattern of dark markings on a yellowish to greenish body. This pattern is what they were named for. Like other pike they have a forked tail fin and a long pointed head. Chain pickerel have a dark bar underneath each eye. The eye color is yellow or yellowish. They can live up to 10 years.\nHabitat and forage.\nIn waters not shared with Northern pike or Muskies, Chain pickerel can be abundant. They prefer shallow weedy pools and submerged trees, limbs or man-made structures. These can be dock pilings, or riprap. Pickerel ambush their prey. They eat other fish, frogs, crayfish and small mammals. Young pickerel eat aquatic insects and small Crustacea. During the winter months the adult fish move to deeper water.\nSpawning begins when water temperatures approach 50\u00b0F. Unlike others in the pike family, Chain pickerel eggs are sticky and ribbons of eggs stick to underwater weeds. Females lay up to 50,000 eggs. Unlike other fish, Chain pickerel do not remain to guard their young fry.\nAngling.\nChain pickerel are not as popular as other game fish. A good number are caught by accident while fishing for other fish. But they are popular with ice fishermen in the winter. Chain pickerel are a very good fighting fish. Anyone hooking one is in for an exciting fight. They will attack a live minnow or any lure that resembles one. In Canada, Walleyes are called 'pickerel' which sometimes confuses identification. But a walleye and a pike are very different in appearance.\nThe world record for a chain pickerel is 9 pounds 6 ounces. It was caught in Georgia in 1961. Chain pickerel rarely grow longer than 36 inches."}

It is also called synchronous rotation. The classic example is the Moon: the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. \nA tidally locked body takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner. This makes one hemisphere constantly face the partner body. Usually, at any given time only the satellite is tidally locked around the larger body. If the two bodies are similar in mass, and their distance apart is small, the tidal force will lock \"each\" to the other. This is the case between Pluto and Charon. \nIf the Moon were not spinning at all, it would alternately show its near and far sides to Earth, while moving around Earth in orbit.\nIt is possible to work out how long it takes for a particular case of tidal locking to occur. It is just a rough estimate, because some factors are poorly known. An example is the rigidity of a planetary body and its change in shape under tidal force. Tidal locking is an aspect of orbital resonance.\nList of known tidally locked bodies.\nSolar System.\nLocked to the Earth\nLocked to Mars\nLocked to Jupiter\nLocked to Saturn\nLocked to Uranus\nLocked to Neptune\nLocked to Pluto\nLibration.\nLibration is an oscillating motion of orbiting bodies relative to each other. Examples include the motion of the Moon relative to Earth, or of Trojan asteroids relative to planets.\nThe Moon generally has one hemisphere facing the Earth, due to tidal locking. Therefore, our first view of the far side of the Moon resulted from lunar exploration in the 1960s. \nHowever, this simple picture is only approximately true: over time, slightly \"more\" than half (about 59%) of the Moon's surface is seen from Earth due to libration.\nLibration is a slow rocking back and forth of the Moon as viewed from Earth, permitting an observer to see slightly different halves of the surface at different times."}

It is one of the most known nebulae because of its shape when seen from Earth. \nComposition of the nebula.\nThe dark cloud of dust and gas is a region in the Orion nebula where star formation is taking place. The nebula contains over 100 known organic and inorganic gases. It also consists of large and complex organic molecules.\nThe red or pinkish glow comes from hydrogen gas behind the nebula. Magnetic fields channel the gases leaving the nebula into streams that show as streaks in the background glow. A glowing strip of hydrogen gas marks the edge of the massive cloud. Thee densities of stars are different on either side. \nThe darkness of the Horsehead is caused by thick dust blocking the light of stars behind it. The lower part of the Horsehead's neck casts a shadow to the left. Bright spots in the Horsehead Nebula's base are young stars just in the process of forming. "}

Many crashes involving computers are often the result of machine instructions not running right.

(In German, \"Sonderkommando\" means \"special unit\".) They worked in and around the gas chambers, which the Nazis used to murder many people.\nWhat did the \"Sonderkommando\" do?\nThe \"Sonderkommandos\" did not kill anybody. When the Nazi guards at the concentration camps killed people in their gas chambers, they made the \"Sonderkommandos\" do a few different jobs:\nLife as a \"Sonderkommando\".\nUsually, the Nazi camp guards chose people for the \"Sonderkommando\" groups right after those people got to the concentration camps. They almost always chose Jewish prisoners. These people were told they would be killed if they did not agree. They were not told what kind of work they would have to do. Sometimes, the new \"Sonderkommando\" would find the bodies of their own families in the gas chambers. They were not allowed to change jobs or refuse to work. The only way they could stop working as \"Sonderkommando\" would be to kill themselves.\nSometimes the groups of \"Sonderkommandos\" were very big. As the Nazis killed more and more people in the concentration camps, they wanted more \"Sonderkommandos\". By 1943, at Birkenau concentration camp (also called \"Auschwitz II\"), the groups of \"Sonderkommando\" included 400 prisoners. But when many more Jews from Hungary were sent to the camp in 1944, the Nazis added 500 more \"Sonderkommando\".\nThe Nazis needed the \"Sonderkommandos\" to stay strong enough to work. Because of this, they were treated a little better than the other prisoners. They were allowed to sleep in their own barracks. They were also allowed to keep things like food, medicines, and cigarettes that had belonged to people who were killed in the gas chambers. The Nazis allowed these things because they wanted to be able to kill people as quickly as possible in the gas chambers. Without the \"Sonderkommando\" to help with the dead bodies, the Nazis would not be able to use the gas chambers as much.\nDeath.\nBecause they knew so much about how the Nazis were killing so many people, the Nazis thought of the \"Sonderkommando\" as \"Geheimnistr\u00e4ger\" \u2014 people who knew secrets. Because of this, they were kept apart from other prisoners in the camps. The Nazis also did not want anyone outside the camps to know what they were doing. To make sure the \"Sonderkommando\" could never tell what they knew, the Nazis would regularly kill all of the \"Sonderkommando\", usually about every 3 months. Then they would choose a new group out of new prisoners just getting to the camps. The new group's first job would be to burn the bodies of the old \"Sonderkommandos\".\n\"Sonderkommandos\" fight back.\nSome \"Sonderkommandos\" tried to revolt (fight back) against the Nazis. For example, in 1944, \"Sonderkommandos\" at Auschwitz partly destroyed one of the crematoria used for burning bodies. For months, young Jewish women had secretly been taking small amounts of gunpowder from a weapons factory in the Auschwitz camp. They had been sneaking that gunpowder to men and women in the camp's resistance movement. (The resistance movement was a group of prisoners at Auschwitz who decided to fight back against the Nazis, sometimes in secret ways.) Using this gunpowder, the leaders of the \"Sonderkommando\" planned to blow up the gas chambers and crematoria, and start a rebellion against the camp's guards.\nHowever, before this plan was ready, people in the camp's resistance movement found out that the Nazi guards were going to murder the \"Sonderkommando\" on 7 October 1944. The resistance members warned the \"Sonderkommando\", who attacked the guards with two machine guns, axes, knives and grenades. They killed about 3 guards and hurt about 12 others. A total of 451 \"Sonderkommandos\" were killed on this day. Some died fighting the camp's guards. Some did not, and were executed later that day by the Nazis.\nThere were also revolts in two other concentration camps, called Treblinka and Sobib\u00f3r. At Treblinka, on 2 August 1943, around 100 prisoners were able to escape from the camp. At Sobib\u00f3r, \"Sonderkommando\" in one part of the camp (Camp I) revolted on 14 October 1943. The \"Sonderkommando\" in another part of the camp (Camp III) did not revolt, but were murdered the next day.\nOther \"Sonderkommandos\" fought back secretly. For example, at Auschwitz, in August 1944, members of the \"Sonderkommando\" were able to take pictures showing bodies being burned and people being sent to the gas chambers. They snuck these pictures out of the camp as proof of what the Nazis were doing.\nFewer than twenty out of several thousand members of the \"Sonderkommando\" are known to have survived and were able to testify to what happened. After World War II, at some camps, people found notes that members of the \"Sonderkommando\" had buried or hidden, hoping that someone would find the notes later and know what happened.\nTestimonies.\nBetween 1943 and 1944, some members of the \"Sonderkommando\" at Birkenau (Auschwitz II) were able to get pens and paper, and they wrote about the things they had seen at the camp. They buried the things they wrote near the crematoria. Their writings were found after the war ended.\nFor example, this note was found buried in the Auschwitz crematoria. It was written by Zalman Gradowski, a \"Sonderkommando\" who was killed in the revolt on 7 October 1944:\"Dear finder of these notes, I have one request of you ... that my days of Hell, that my hopeless tomorrow will find a purpose in the future. I am transmitting [writing about] only a part of what happened in the Birkenau-Auschwitz Hell. You will realize what reality looked like ... From all this you will have a picture of how our people perished [died].\""}

They go to Wolfman's building and later find that each went through a make over by a mysterious machine called the \"Fabulizor\". They later see that everyone at school also had gone through the Fabulizor and Oinky ends up going through the Fabulizor too. They are almost blasted by one of Fabu's minions in a fighter jet after avoiding Miss Skritch as they sneak back into school. Tailing Mandy that night, they find that all of those who went through the Fabulizor became hypnotized by a special chip in their cheek bones. They then meet the mastermind behind the entire affair, Fabu, a runway model who quickly lost his fame. The spies accidentally expose themselves and are captured by Fabu's strongest henchmen. He then relates his entire plan, to abduct everyone who went through the Fabulizor and place them inside a special space station which he calls Fabutopia; then use a missile to destroy all of Earth, before using his Fabulizor in reverse and give the girls each horrible make overs. He then sets them to be blasted back to Earth in rockets. But when Tad meets the girls again, they are still imprisoned and he says he will let them fail the mission and stop Fabu himself, taking all the credit and regaining his \"favorite agent\" status with Jerry.\nBut after a fight with Fabu, Tad is strapped to the missile bound for Earth. The girls manage to escape and go after Fabu. They are unable to stop the missile from taking off but hitch a ride as it is rocketing towards Earth with Tad still attached to it. They are able to turn the missile around to destroy the station and Alex whacks at the control panel with the WOOHP manual. They then are picked up by a surprise appearance from Jerry in one of WOOHP's ships and rescue the kidnapped people from aboard the station and evacuate safely, including Oinky. They are finally reunited with Alex before the missile explodes and destroys the station in a firework finale. They then chase after Fabu's ship, manage to destroy it and catch Fabu and his Sphynx in his escape pod. After the mission, Alex is invited for a session with Wolfman and Clover is offered a date by Rob Hearthrob over the phone.\nMiss Skritch had been transferred to another school in Antarctica in an igloo, Fabu, his henchmen and Tad are later imprisoned and set for punishment by WOOHP and everyone who was rescued from aboard Fabu's space station have their minds erased (including Mandy). But just after the girls celebrate getting even with Mandy for the last time, courtesy of one of WOOHP's gadgets, they are sucked away to another mission. The girls are quick to bring up personal appointments, but soon find themselves running from a WOOHP jet as it prepares to suck them aboard. But the girls are ready for their mission as they change into their spy uniforms and exclaim their friendship as the movie ends.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\nThe movie was released in France on 22 July 2009 in 272 theatres.\nOn 14 October 2009 the movie hit the Netherlands and stayed there for seven weeks.

They are named after the ionised atomic hydrogen which they produce: H\u00a0II.\nThe stars form inside a large cloud of hydrogen gas. The short-lived blue stars formed in these regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light. This ionizes the surrounding gas. \nH\u00a0II regions can be several hundred light-years across. The first known H\u00a0II region was the Orion nebula, which was discovered in 1610. These regions have extremely varied shapes. They often appear clumpy and filamentary, sometimes showing bizarre shapes such as the Horsehead nebula. \nH\u00a0II regions give birth to thousands of stars over several million years. Eventually, this produces a star cluster. In the end, supernova explosions and strong stellar winds from the most massive stars blow away the gases of the H\u00a0II region. This leaves behind behind a cluster of stars such as the Pleiades.\nH\u00a0II regions can be seen at huge distances in the universe.The study of extragalactic H\u00a0II regions helps to fix the distance and chemical composition of other galaxies. \nSpiral and irregular galaxies have many H\u00a0II regions, while elliptical galaxies have almost none. In spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, H\u00a0II regions are found in the spiral arms, but in the irregular galaxies they are distributed at random. \nSome galaxies have huge H\u00a0II regions, with tens of thousands of stars.

It has been written 5000 years, which makes it one of the oldest written languages known today. The Coptic language is the modern form of the Egyptian language. The Egyptian language changed into it over time. The Copts use it for religious purposes. Only a few people are still fluent in Coptic. While the modern variant is known, the older variants could only be translated when the Rosetta stone was found in 1799. The Rosetta stone contains the same text in three languages, one of which was known at the time.\nThe oldest records of the Egyptian language date from about 3400 BC. \nEgyptian was spoken until the late 17th century AD in the form of Coptic. The national language of modern-day Egypt is Egyptian Arabic, which replaced Coptic as the language of daily life in the centuries after the Muslim conquest of Egypt.\nHistory.\nScholars group the Egyptian language into six major chronological divisions:\nEgyptian writing in the form of labels and signs has been dated to 3200 BC. These early texts are generally called \"Archaic Egyptian.\"\nIn 1999, \"Archaeology Magazine\" reported that the earliest Egyptian glyphs date back to 3400 BC which \"...challenge the commonly held belief that early logographs, pictographic symbols representing a specific place, object, or quantity, first evolved into more complex phonetic symbols in Mesopotamia.\"\nOld Egyptian was spoken for about 500 years from 2600 BC onwards. Middle Egyptian was spoken from about 2000 BC for a further 700 years when Late Egyptian made its appearance; Middle Egyptian survived until the first few centuries AD as a written language, similar to the use of Latin during the Middle Ages and that of Classical Arabic today. Demotic Egyptian first appears about 650 BC and survived as a spoken language until the fifth century AD. Coptic Egyptian appeared in the fourth century AD and survived as a living language until the sixteenth century AD, when European scholars traveled to Egypt to learn it from native speakers during the Renaissance. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that. The Bohairic dialect of Coptic is still used by the Egyptian Christian Churches.\nOld, Middle, and Late Egyptian were all written using hieroglyphs and hieratic. Demotic was written using a script derived from hieratic; its appearance is vaguely similar to modern Arabic script and is also written from right to left. Coptic is written using the Coptic alphabet, a modified form of the Greek alphabet with a number of symbols borrowed from Demotic for sounds that did not occur in contemporary Greek.\nArabic became the language of Egypt's political administration soon after the Arab conquest in the seventh century AD. Over time, it replaced Coptic as the language spoken by the common people. Today, Coptic survives as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church.\nThe Bible contains some words, terms and names thought by scholars to be Egyptian in origin. An example of this is Zaphnath-Paaneah, the Egyptian name given to Joseph."}

(Most normal seizures last only one to two minutes.)\nToday, a person is usually described as being \"in status\" when:\nWhy is Status Epilepticus a Medical Emergency?\nStatus epilepticus is very dangerous. About 10 - 20 % of the people who go into this status die from it.\nStatus Epilepticus is considered a medical emergency for many reasons:\nIf people in status get the right treatment quickly, they can survive with little or no brain damage.\nCauses.\nOnly about one in four people who go into status epilepticus have epilepsy. The other three out of four people who go into status have never had a seizure before. Status epilepticus can happen for many other reasons.\nIllnesses.\nMany different illnesses can cause status epilepticus:\nInjuries.\nVery bad injuries can also cause status:\nDrugs and medications.\nIllegal drugs, alcohol, and some medications can cause status:\nTreatment.\nPeople in status epilepticus are unable to end their seizures on their own. They are often unconscious and unable to react.\nThe most common way to end status is to inject special medicines that can stop seizures. If these medicines do not help, the patient must be treated in the intensive care unit at a hospital. Sometimes patients have to be put into a coma to stop very bad status epilepticus."}

He shared the prize with Godfrey Hounsfield.\nLife.\nCormack was born on February 23, 1924 in Johannesburg, South Africa. During his early years, he attended the Rondebosch Boys' High School in Cape Town, and was a member of the debating and tennis teams. In 1944, Cormack received his BSc in physics from the University of Cape Town and in 1945, he received his MSc in crystallography in 1945 from the university. From 1947 to 1949, he attended University of Cambridge as a research student. While there, he met Barbara Seavey, an American physics student. Comack and Seavey would later get married.\nAfter they got married, Cormack returned to lecture at the University of Cape Town in early 1950. After he took a break at Harvard from 1956 to 1957, Cormack and Seavey moved to the United States. He would then take a job as a professor at Tufts University in 1957. In 1966, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Even though he was mostly working on particle physics, he had a side interest in x-ray technology which led him to develop the theoretical underpinnings of CT scanning. The work that he did on this started at the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital in early 1956. It continued shortly in mid-1957 after he returned from his break. His results were afterwards published in two papers in the Journal of Applied Physics in 1963 and 1964. The papers that had been published drew hardly any interest until the first CT scanner was built by Hounsfield and colleagues in 1971 which took Cormack's theoretical calculations into a real application. He was then the recipient of the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine which he shared with Godfrey Hounsfield. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.\nCormack and his wife had three children; Margaret, Jean and Robert. Cormack died on May 7, 1998 in Winchester, Massachusetts from cancer. On December 10, 2002, Cormack was posthumously awarded the Order of Mapungubwe for his outstanding achievements as a scientist and for co-inventing the CT scanner."}

The birds only catch prey which is flying: they ignore flying insects once they land.\nMostly, they eat honeybees. Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) make up from 20% to 96% of all insects eaten. Before eating its meal, a bee-eater removes the sting by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. The bird squeezes out most of the venom.\nBee-eaters live together. They form colonies by nesting in burrows tunnelled into the side of sandy banks, such as those that have collapsed on the edges of rivers. Many of these holes occur together.\nMost of the species in the family are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with the assistance of other birds in the colony, a behaviour rather unusual for birds."}

Support was dropped for the iPhone 3G and the iPod Touch (2nd generation), and devices that are supported are the iPhone 3GS and later, the iPod Touch (3rd generation) and later, and the first generation iPad and later.\nWhen the iPhone 4S was announced on October 4, 2011, the release date for iOS 5 was also announced. iOS 5 was released on October 12, 2011.\nThe iPhone 4S already had iOS 5 installed on it, but other devices had to have the update installed through iTunes. At first, many people could not install iOS 5 because they got error messages when they tried to download it. This was because Apple's servers could not keep up with the number of people who are downloading the update.\nFeatures.\niCloud.\nApple's cloud-based service, iCloud, came as part of the iOS 5 update. This feature allows users to sync their music, pictures, videos, and more across all of their devices that have iCloud on them. Each user is given 5 gigabytes of storage for free, but they are allowed to sync unlimited amounts of music, apps, books, and photos.\nNew apps.\nA new feature called iMessage, built into the Messages app, allows anyone with an iOS device to send unlimited messages to people with iOS 5. It also allows iPhone users to send text messages to people who don't have an iOS device. The Messages app used to be only on the iPhone, but iOS 5 brought it to the iPod Touch and iPad.\nThe Reminders app allows users to make lists and alerts that can be based on a date or a location.\nThe Newsstand app is not a real app, but it is a folder that shows the newspapers and magazines that the user is subscribed to.\nOther new features.\niOS 5 allows devices to sync with iTunes wirelessly for the first time, without being connected to a computer. iOS devices can also be activated and updated over a wireless network for the first time.\nIn iOS 5, you can get to the camera quickly from the lock screen swiping up on the camera icon. Users can get to the camera without having to enter a passcode, but you can only use the camera. At first, you had to double-click the home button on the lock screen to get to the camera button, but it was changed in iOS 5.1 so that you could swipe up on the camera button.\nNotification Center was introduced in iOS 5, and it also changed how notifications are displayed. Instead of a message that appears in the middle of the screen, stopping what was going on at the time, they appear in a banner on the top of the screen. You can access Notification Center by swiping down from the top of the screen, where it is hidden, and it shows notifications that happened in the past."}

He played at the first Augusta National golf tournament in 1934 (now known as the Masters Tournament). He was the last living person to play in the first Masters. He was an active golfer between the 1930s and the 1970s.\nBall was born in Bangor, Gwynedd, north west Wales. During his 20s, he moved to the United States, under the request from his uncle. He turned 100 in November 2010. He was married to Maxie for 78 years until his death. Maxie was 99 when Ball died. They had a daughter named Leslie.\nBall died from natural causes on July 2, 2014 in Stuart, Florida, aged 103. His wife and their daughter outlived him."}

Compliance is important for the treatment of chronic diseases.\nWorldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. In 2003, the World Health Organization estimated that only about half the patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations. In particular, low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma, diabetes, and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions. Compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature, as compliance is often high in the setting of a formal clinical trial but drops off in a \"real-world\" setting.\nSome drugs are difficult to take, because they must be taken at a specific time or interval; sometimes, several drugs must be taken together. This is seen as a major obstacle to compliance. Other factors that may adversely influence compliance are that many patients do not understand the benefits of being treated, or they see side-effects that they were not told about, the drugs costing a lot of money, poor communication or lack of trust between the patient and their health-care provider. Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying drug packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed at the same time."}

Together with the red algae (Rhodophyta) and green algae plus land plants (Viridiplantae or Chloroplastida), they form the Archaeplastida.\nThe glaucophytes are of interest because they may be similar to the original algal type that led to green plants and red algae. The relationships between these groups are not yet clear, and the glaucophytes in particular need more study.\nCharacteristics.\nThe chloroplasts of glaucophytes are known as 'cyanelles'. Unlike the chloroplasts in other organisms, they have a peptidoglycan layer, like bacterial cell walls. This is thought to be a relic of the endosymbiotic origin of plastids from cyanobacteria.\nGlaucophytes have the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a. They harvest light with the same type of pigment molecules as do cyanobacteria and red algae. Green algae and land plants have lost that pigment, which is known as phycobiliprotein.\nGlaucophyte mitochondria and flagella (if present) are similar to forms found in some green algae.\nClassification.\nOnly 13 species of glaucophytes are known, none of which is particularly common in nature. There are three genera.\nThe glaucophytes were previously placed in the order Chlorococcales."}

A multicellular form has recently been described.\nThis supergroup was proposed by Cavalier-Smith in 2002. It has many species.

They make up the vast majority of protozoan fossils. Nearly all have mitochondria with folds.\nGroups.\nThere are three main groups of Rhizaria:\nEvolutionary relationship.\nRhizaria is part of the bikont clade, which also comprises the Archaeplastida, the Chromalveolata, the Excavata, and some smaller, groups. As bikonts, they all descend from a heterotrophic eukaryote with two flagella.\nHistorically, many rhizarians were considered animals, with their movement and heterotrophy as justification. However, when the five-kingdom system took prevalence over the animal-plant dichotomy, the rhizarians were put into the kingdom Protista. Then, after Carl Woese published his three-domain system, taxonomists turned their attention to the eukaryote domain. The protists are paraphyletic, so needed to be split into monophyletic clades. After much debate, which continues to this day, Rhizaria emerged as one of those monophyletic groups."}

The wrestler dives wraps their near arm around the opponent's head in a front facelock and swings themselves backwards in midair, performing a DDT.\nDiving double axe handle.\nA diving double axe handle (also known as diving axe handle, diving double axe handle smash or diving double sledge) is a move where a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle to either the mat or floor and hits their opponent with two fists that are held together in the fashion of holding an axe.\nDiving elbow drop.\nA diving elbow drop is a move where a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle and lands on a downed opponent with their cocked elbow. There is also a less common version called the diving back elbow drop, where a wrestler climbs to the top turnbuckle, jumps backwards, cocks their elbow and lands their elbow on the opponent. The diving elbow drop was popularized by \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage who used it as his finisher. CM Punk adopted the moved as a tribute to Savage after he died.\nPointed elbow drop.\nA pointed elbow drop is a move where a wrestler that is sitting on the top turnbuckle, jumps while clasping their forearms together, and lands on their knees, while driving both elbows into either the shoulder or chest of their opponent.\nDiving fist drop.\nA diving fist drop is a move where a wrestler jumps from the top turnbuckle onto the opponent and drives their fist into either the opponent's chest or head. \nDiving headbutt.\nA diving headbutt happens when a wrestler jumps from either the top rope or turnbuckle and lands anywhere on the opponent's body. Harley Race accidentally invented the move. The move was popularized by The Dynamite Kid and later by Chris Benoit.

While facing them, the wrestler performing the move wraps their legs around the opponent's head, does a backflip to swing through the opponent's open legs and drags them into a forced somersault which distances the wrestler from the opponent, who lands on his or her back. The name Frankensteiner comes from Scott Steiner, who popularized the move.\nReverse frankensteiner.\nThere is a different version called the reverse frankensteiner, also known as the inverted frankensteiner. The move is performed when an opponent is facing the other way while sitting on the top turnbuckle. The wrestler then performs the frankensteiner but the opponent lands on their chest instead.\nMoonsault.\nA moonsault happens when a wrestler does a backflip and lands on their opponent. It is usually performed from the top turnbuckle. \n630\u00b0 senton.\nA 630\u00b0 senton is a move where a wrestler does a senton and flips 630 degrees forward before landing. A corkscrew can be added. In a corkscrew version, the wrestler faces away from the ring and is on the top turnbuckle, they then perform a 180\u00b0 turn in mid-air and perform a 630\u00b0 senton onto a lying opponent.\nShiranui.\nA shiranui is a move where a wrestler puts their opponent in a three-quarter facelock, runs up the corner turnbuckles, jumps backwards, does a backflip in the air and lands face down on the mat, driving the opponent back first on the mat. There is a standing version and a \"sitout shiranui\" where the wrestler lands in a seated position and drives the opponent's head between their legs. It is the finishing move of Brian Kendrick who calls it the \"Sliced Bread #2\". The move was invented by Naomichi Marufuji.\nShooting star.\nA shooting star is when a wrestler jumps forward from higher ground and performs a backflip in midair. The most common technique of the shooting star is the shooting star press.\nShooting star press.\nA shooting star press is a move where the wrestler jumps forward, presses their knees to their chest, does a backflip in midair and lands on their opponent chest first. A corkscrew version has also been used where the wrestler either a 180\u00b0, 360\u00b0 or more in midair and lands in either a senton or press. The move was invented by Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger.\nShooting star leg drop.\nA shooting star leg drop is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, continues the rotation (by either doing a full 360\u00b0 or more rotation) and lands on the downed opponent with their leg. \nShooting star elbow drop.\nA shooting star elbow drop is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, and lands on the downed opponent with their elbow.\nShooting star DDT.\nA shooting star DDT is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, catches the standing opponent and performs a DDT on the way down. \nShooting star senton.\nA shooting star senton is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, does a backflip in midair, and continues the rotation (by either doing a full 360\u00b0 or more rotation) and adds another 90 which ends in a senton.\nCorkscrew Shooting star press.\nA corkscrew shooting star press is a move where the wrestler jumps forward from higher ground, twists and flips backwards at the same time, and hits a shooting star press. Pac/Adrian Neville uses the move as his finisher which he calls the \"Red Arrow\".\nSunset flip.\nA sunset flip is a pinning move performed when a wrestler is on higher ground. The wrestler then dives over the opponent, catches them in a waist-lock from behind and rolls them into a sitting position when they hit the mat. When the wrestler rolls over the opponent, they pull the opponent backwards and land their back into a pinning position. \nTransition moves.\nSome of the moves that are done are not meant to pin an opponent or weaken them. They are used to set up another attack on an opponent.\nSpringboard.\nA springboard is when a wrestler bounces themself upward off of a rope into a move. There is also a double springboard where a wrestler bounces off one rope and onto another. Some moves that can be done from a springboard position are a springboard dropkick, springboard legdrop and a springboard moonsault.\nSlingshot.\nA slingshot is when a wrestler, who is standing on the ring apron, pulls the top rope and uses the momentum that is gained to hurl themself over the rope and into the ring.\nModifiers.\nCorkscrew.\nA corkscrew is when a wrestler twists themself in the air. It can also refer to when a wrestler does a backflip but it is twisted so the wrestler faces the inside of the ring instead of the outside when the move ends. \nPlancha.\nA Plancha is the name in American wrestling for when a wrestler performs a slingshot crossbody to an opponent on the outside of the ring. In lucha libre, it is called a Pescado when a wrestler uses the top ring rope for the slingshot. \nRopewalk.\nA ropewalk is when a wrestler walks across the top rope before performing a move. The Undertaker uses a ropewalk in his \"Old School\" signature move.\nSuicide.\nthe name \"suicide\" or \"suicida\" is used before any move that wrestler uses which goes either from the ring, the ring apron, or the turnbuckles to the outside of the ring. The most common move is the \"suicide dive\" or \"top\u00e9 suicida\" where a wrestler jumps through the ring ropes to the opponent on the outside. Sometimes a front flip is used after the wrestler leaps through the ropes, this is known as \"suicide senton\" or \"Top\u00e9 con Hilo\". "}

The song was released on 8 August 1994. \nThe song was written by Noel Gallagher in 1991 before he joined Oasis. \"Live Forever\" was inspired by The Rolling Stones song \"Shine a Light\". It featured an optimistic outlook which differed from the attitude of the grunge bands which were popular at that time. Noel Gallagher presented a fully composed \"Live Forever\" to the band for the first time in early 1993 during their rehearsals. According to drummer Tony McCarroll, the band were awed by it. The demo version of the song begins with an acoustic guitar intro. While recording the album version, the producer Owen Morris cut out the intro and replaced it with a drumbeat that was played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Although Gallagher was upset, Morris felt the part had sounded \"a bit like fucking Slash from Guns N' Roses\".\nThe song is understood to be an ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy.In general, the lyrics to the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that \"At the time . . . it was written in the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like . . . 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him (Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain) and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense.\" While Gallagher said that he did not intend \"Live Forever\" as a direct reply to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he differed the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, \"Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man\". Gallagher says that the line \"We see things they'll never see\" is the most important line of the song and explained that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that \"no one else gets\"."}

It ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish-white. Skin colour is inherited and is the result of natural selection. Skin pigmentation in human beings evolved mainly to control the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin, thus reducing its effects.\nThe single most important substance deciding human skin colour is the pigment melanin. Melanin is produced within the skin by cells called melanocytes. The red colour underlying the skin becomes more visible in white skin, especially in the face. In physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system (anger, fear), blood vessels expand.\nThere is a direct relationship between UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that have more UVR also have darker-skinned populations. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR, and lighter-skinned populations. Human populations have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned as they left Africa about 100,000 years ago, and some have changed back to darker skin as they returned to higher UV zones.\nNatural skin colour can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin colour adapts to intense sunlight to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction which damages DNA of the skin cells and so produces mutations.\nIt is easy to see why dark skin is an advantage in the tropics as a partial defence against skin cancer. It is much less easy to see why a white skin is an advantage in colder climates. Researchers have suggested two reasons, and both probably play a part. The first is that, at a given temperature, a white skin radiates less heat than a black skin. The second is that in weaker sunlight the body tends to produce less vitamin D. There is a hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin is due to the need for higher vitamin D production. The change started as soon as populations moved north out of Africa.\nIn addition, adult human females are usually lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The body synthesizes vitamin D from the action of sunlight on the skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.\nThe social significance of differences in skin color has varied across cultures and over time, as demonstrated with regard to social status and discrimination."}

There are many questions about their ecology. The bird was capable of highly efficient gliding. That suggests it had a long-range marine soaring life-style similar to that of living albatrosses.\nSeveral later species have been found, and they are not quite so large.

At first it was thought to be a condition caused by acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia). It may be caused by a head injury to the temporal lobe of the brain.\nHowever, a congenital (inherited birth defect) or developmental form of the disorder does exist, with a prevalence rate of 2.5%. That is quite a high rate. What this defect shows is that our picture of the world is built up by various brain systems, and we do not notice how this is done. It seems seamless and automatic. Actually, there are many brain mechanisms which normally work together, tying the visual scene to memory so that we recall vital information. It is difficult to think of anything more vital than remembering who we know, and what their relationship is to us. \n\"People with prosopagnosia never develop the ability to recognize faces\". They may be able to rely on other physical features, such as the way someone walks and talks, their hair color, their height and build, etc. Prosopagnosia is not curable or treatable.\nThe opposite of prosopagnosia is the skill of superior face recognition ability. People with this ability are called \"super recognizers\".\nCause.\nProsopagnosia can be caused by lesions (damage or changes to body tissue) in the lower part of the brain. It can also be caused by damaging the nerves in the lower part of the brain, called 'acquired prosopagnosia'. It can be caused by birth defects, carbon monoxide poisoning, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease.\nDoctors can check patients for prosopagnosia by using PET and fMRI scans to see if their brain reacts when they see faces.\nAn analysis of family inheritance (pedigree trees) suggest that a dominant gene mutation may be the root cause of the condition when it is present from birth. This mode of inheritance explains why HPA is so common among certain families.\nAn account of a woman who cannot recognise her own face is an example of prosopagnosia. Its special interest is that she can recognise all inanimate objects, and all animals except humans and chimpanzees!"}

A shortshot can cause the ride to be closed for a period of time while the ride is reset and tested several times before it can be opened again.

The method is guided by research done by a variety of applied psychologists and educators.\nThe learning material is in a kind of textbook or teaching machine or computer. The medium presents the material in a logical and tested sequence. The text is in small steps or larger chunks. After each step, learners are given a question to test their comprehension. Then immediately the correct answer is shown. This means the learner at all stages makes responses, and is given immediate knowledge of results.\nIt is rather interesting that Edward L. Thorndike wrote in 1912:\n\"If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print\".\nThorndike, however, did nothing with his idea. The first such system was devised by Sidney L. Pressey in 1926. \"The first.. [teaching machine] was developed by Sidney L. Pressey... While originally developed as a self-scoring machine... [it] demonstrated its ability to actually teach\".\nLater developments.\nIn World War II, with largely conscript armies, there was great emphasis on training. What was learnt influenced education and training after the war. One of the main methods was the use of movies as a group training method. Research on the effectiveness of training films was done extensively. In one account, Lumsdaine comments that research on films went on \"from about 1918 to the present\" (meaning 1962).\nA few conclusions stood out from the research. One was that films were great at giving overviews of a situation or an operation. However, they were less successful at getting over the details. Some general features of film (and, later, television) stand out. One is that a film goes at its own pace. Another is that no specific responses or activities are required from the viewer. A third is that the audience is varied, sometimes hugely varied. This gives clues to ways of improving instructional films.\nIn a 1946 experiment at Yale University, questions for students were put between segments of a film on the heart and circulation, with correct answers given after students had responded (knowledge of results). This added significantly to the amount learnt from the film. Lumsdaine commented that even showing the basic film twice was not so effective as showing the version with questions and answers.612\nThe connections between this experiment and those of Pressey were obvious. Active responses by learners and helpful feedback on the activities were now seen as critical elements in any successful system of learning. Pressey's work had been half forgotten, but it was now recognised as significant.\nProgrammed learning arrives.\nWhat is programmed learning?\nIf so much research had already been done on learning from films, what exactly did programmed learning add? The short answer is \"stimulus control\", by which is broadly meant the teaching material itself. Also, in programmed learning, a complete system was proposed which included these stages:\nA helpful discussion of the different programming techniques was given by Klaus.\nThe two main systems.\nAlthough there were three or four other systems proposed, we discuss here the two best-known methods.\nOne was by Norman Crowder, a psychologist with the U.S. Air Force. He had been asked to investigate the training of aircraft maintenance men. Crowder's system was to set multiple choice questions in the text, and provide feedback for each of the alternatives. Examples of this method show that the alternatives offered in questions were chosen to cover mistakes which students were likely to make.\nMuch better known was the other style of programmed learning, as proposed by the behaviourist B.F. Skinner. Skinner made some very effective criticisms of traditional teaching methods. His scheme of programmed instruction was to present the material as part of a \"schedule of reinforcement\" in typical behaviourist manner. The programmed text of Skinner's theory of behaviorism is the most complete example of his ideas in action. Skinner was a wonderful publicist for his own ideas, as can be seen from this passage:\nBoth methods were originally presented in machines, and both were later presented in book form. Both systems were to an extent student centered. They were ways of teaching individual learners who worked at their own pace. Both systems (in different ways) used knowledge of results to promote learning.p619 In both systems the content was pre-tested to identify problems and iron them out. Both systems emphasised clear learning objectives. Progress in learning was measured by pre- and post-tests of equivalent difficulty. Many practical tests showed the effectiveness of these methods.\nMany of these ideas were picked up and used in other educational fields, such as open learning (see the Open University) and computer-assisted learning."}

Pressey (Brooklyn, New York, 1888 1979) was Professor of Psychology at Ohio State University for many years. He is famous for having invented a teaching machine many years before the idea became popular.\nCareer.\nPressey joined Ohio State in 1921, and stayed there until he retired in 1959. He continued publishing after retirement, with 18 papers between 1959 and 1967. He was a cognitive psychologist who \"rejected a view of learning as an accumulation of responses governed by environmental stimuli in favor of one governed by meaning, intention, and purpose\". In fact, he had been a cognitive psychologist his entire life, well before the \"mythical birthday of the cognitive revolution in psychology\".\nPressey was the first winner of the E.L. Thorndike Award for achievements in educational technology, in 1964. This is an award of the American Psychological Association.\nEarly readability formula.\nIn 1923, Pressey and a co-worker published the first reading ease formula. They had been concerned that science textbooks in junior high school had so many technical words. They felt that teachers spent all class time explaining their meaning. They argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the \u201cvocabulary burden\u201d of textbooks. Their formula, based on the Thorndike word list, took three hours to apply to a single book. It was a measure of vocabulary difficulty. Many later formulae made use of some measure of sentence complexity as well as vocabulary. These are the two main causes of text difficulty or 'readability'.\nThe 'teaching machine'.\nPressey's idea started as a machine for administering multiple-choice questions to students. These were (and are still) a basic method for testing students in the U.S.A.. The machine had a window with a question and four answers. The student pressed the key to the chosen answer. The machine recorded the answer on a counter to the back of the machine, and showed the next question.\nThe great idea was to fix the machine so that it would not move on until the student chose the right answer. Then it was easy to show that the second arrangement taught the students what were the right answers. This was the first demonstration that a machine could teach, and also a demonstration that knowledge of results was the cause of the learning.\nA number of reviews credit Pressey with being the founder of programmed learning and teaching machines, long before the better known efforts of B.F. Skinner. Skinner was, however, responsible for bringing the whole subject into popular view, and his critique of the limitations of traditional classroom teaching is a classic work."}

She founded the Ford Modeling Agency (now called Ford Models) in 1946.\nFord was born in New York City. She died in Morristown, New Jersey at age ninety-two.\nBiography.\nEileen Cecile Otte was born in Manhattan and raised in suburban Great Neck, Long Island, the only daughter of four children of Loretta Marie (n\u00e9e Laine) and Nathaniel Otte. Eileen had been a model during the summers of her freshman and sophomore years at Barnard College, modeling for the Harry Conover Modeling Agency, one of the first in the United States. She graduated from Barnard in 1943.\nThe next year, she met her future husband, Gerard \"Jerry\" Ford, at a drugstore near the Columbia University campus and eloped with him, marrying in November 1944 in San Francisco.\nFord Modeling Agency.\nA pregnant Eileen started to work as a secretary for several models, taking calls at her father's New York City law office, charging each model $65 to $75 per month.\nAlthough the Fords' location was terrible, within a year, the modeling agency was the second or third most successful in the United States, grossing $250,000. The Fords' first superstar model was Jean Patchett. The Fords had the capital to instil the voucher system, something that other modelling agencies were not affluent enough to offer. Dorian Leigh described Eileen as \"one of the hardest working, most persistent persons I have ever known, two qualities which made her my very good friend for years and later, my unanticipated enemy\".\nAfter two years, the Fords began to seriously compete with the Huntington Hartford modeling agency and the John Robert Powers agencies, the two most successful modeling agencies at the time. Leigh, meanwhile, closed her modeling agency when she was pregnant with her third child in 1948. Leigh called Eileen and told them that her 15-years younger sister, Suzy Parker, was making only $25 per hour working as a model for Huntington Hartford.\nThey soon realized, however, that Parker had the possibility of becoming quite a successful model. Soon thereafter, Parker would become the most successful model of the 1950s, helping push the Ford's agency to number one. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Fords represented top models Mary Jane Russell, Carmen Dell'Orefice, and Dovima.\nRetirement.\nIn 1995, Katie Ford took over her parents' agency after their retirement. The 50th anniversary of the agency was highlighted in several articles including the July\u2013August 1996 issue of \"American Photo\" magazine and in January\u2013February 1997's \"Top Model\" magazine (\"Ford at 50!\"). She was CEO from 1995 to 2007. In December 2007, Ford was sold to Stone Tower Equity Partners. John Caplan took over as CEO while Katie Ford was on the Board of Directors. Jerry Ford died at the age 83 on August 24, 2008. He was survived by his wife, four children, eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\nDeath.\nShe died at a hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, from complications of meningioma and osteoporosis, on July 9, 2014, aged 92."}

The show runs on Saturdays from 5 to 7 pm Central Time. It is usually broadcast from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The program is also taken on the road. \"A Prairie Home Companion\" is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians. It is also known for its tongue-in-cheek humor and Keillor's storytelling segment, \"News from Lake Wobegon\".\nThe radio program inspired a 2006 film of the same name, written by Keillor, directed by Robert Altman, and featuring Keillor, Lily Tomlin, Meryl Streep, Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, John C. Reilly, and Woody Harrelson.\nHistory.\n\"A Prairie Home Companion\" started as a morning show, running from 6 to 9 am on Minnesota Public Radio. The first program aired on 6 July 1974 before an audience of 12 people. The idea for the name came from a cemetery in Moorhead, Minnesota called the Prairie Home. It was located across the street from the radio station.\nIn April 1974, Keillor traveled to Nashville. This was the last broadcast of the Grand Ole Opry from the old Ryman Auditorium and Keillor was doing a story for The New Yorker Magazine. He decided to host a variety show based on that format on the radio. On July 6, 1974, the first live broadcast of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" took place.\nIn 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1987, he decided to move to Denmark with his new wife. He then moved to New York City. In 1989 he began a new show \"The American Radio Company of the Air.\" The format was the same, but the program was geared to the New York audience. But after four seasons he moved back to Minnesota and brought back the Prairie Home Companion.\nIn 1985, the program was taped for audiences in Australia and Sweden. In 1990 digital tapes were rebroadcast in Tiwan. By 1995 the program was rebroadcast in numerous countries via satellite.\nProgram.\nMusic is a main feature of the program. It includes many different kinds of music, including country, bluegrass, blues, and gospel. The program also has guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music, including classical, opera and music from a number of different countries.\nNews from Lake Wobegon.\nOne of the show's best-known features is Keillor's \"News from Lake Wobegon\". This is a weekly storytelling monologue, claiming to be a report from Keillor's fictitious hometown of Lake Wobegon. The segment always begins with \"It's been a quiet week in Lake Woebegone, my hometown.\" It almost always ends with \"And that's the news from Lake Wobegon, where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"\nSponsors.\nBecause the program is aired on public broadcasting radio, they are not allowed to have real advertisements. Instead, the show produces fictional advertisements for fictional products. The ads are performed in the style of live old-time radio commercials. The show is \"sponsored\" by fictitious products including \"Powdermilk Biscuits\", \"Cafe Boeuf\" and the \"American Duct Tape Council\".\nThe program recently celebrated its 40th year."}

The Confederates finally made Wallace's force retreat about 4:30\u00a0p.m. However, the delay kept the Confederates from reaching Washington until General Grant's soldiers reached the city.

It is the home of American Public Media's \"A Prairie Home Companion\". The theater is owned by Minnesota Public Radio. The Fitzgerald was also the location for the 2006 film of the same name.\nHistory.\nIt was built in 1910 at a cost of $165,000. It had a sandstone front and was of concrete and steel construction. The theatre had several very modern features for its time. It had 2,000 electric light bulbs. The stage could be lowered and raised by two feet. It had 16 dressing rooms and a side entrance for those arriving in automobiles. It was one of many theaters built by the Shubert Theatre Corporation. It was originally named the Sam S. Shubert Theater. The theatre was designed by the noted Chicago architectural firm of Marshall and Fox.\nBy 1933 it had fallen on hard times. Even the Broadway shows that played there could not make it profitable. That same year it was remodeled in the Art Deco style and renamed the World Theatre. It became a movie theatre and specialized in showing foreign films. By 1978 it was scheduled to be torn down. Minnesota Public Radio was looking for a new home for one of it's programs, A Prairie Home Companion. They were able to lease the theatre for a very reasonable price. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as the Sam S. Shubert Theatre and Shubert Building. In 1985 it was decided the building was unsafe and was in danger of closing permanently. After raising nearly two million dollars, the building was once again renovated. In 1994 it was renamed after St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald.\nMovie location.\nIn 2005, the theater was used for filming the movie \"A Prairie Home Companion\", directed by Robert Altman. Garrison Keillor, the star of the radio show also starred in the movie. He was instrumental in getting Hollywood stars such as Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin for the movie.\nThe movie was shot digitally which allowed the cast and crew to fit into the small building. Even the theatre's basement was used for movie sets. With all the actors, technicians, electricians and carpenters squeezed into a small space, it was \"as crowded as an ant farm\". A Hollywood-style premiere was held at the Fitzgerald on 3 May 2006. A parade led from Rice Park to the theatre and the red carpet was laid out for the stars who arrived in white horse-drawn carriages. "}

They don't stop eating food. There is a mixture that is used for severe dehydration: This mixture also includes zinc. Those who take care of the sick person are taught how they can see it if the dehydration gets worse. The World Health Organization and UNICEF specify indications, preparations and procedures for ORT.\nThe therapy was developed in the second half of the 20th century. It has helped lower the number of human deaths from dehydration in vomiting and diarrheal illnesses, especially in cholera epidemics occurring in children. It is sign for public health getting better all over the world. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.\nBefore ORT was used often, most of the children who died in developing nations, died from diarrhea. Between 1980 and 2006, the introduction of ORT is thought to have lowered the number of young children who died anywhere in the world from 5 to 3 million every year. However, in 2008, diarrhea is still the second most common cause of death in children under five years (17 percent), (after pneumonia (19 percent)). Moreover, by the same year, the use of ORT in children under five had declined.\nPreparation.\nWHO and UNICEF developed official guidelines for how to make ORS. Depending on what materials are available, they propose different alternative preparations. Commercial preparations are available as either pre-prepared fluids or packets of oral rehydration salts (ORS) ready for mixing with the fluid.\nWHO/UNICEF's formula is salt (NaCal), trisodium citrate dihydrate , KCl, anhydrous glucose (formula_1) per litre of fluid. \nA basic oral rehydration therapy solution is composed of salt, sugar, and water in solution, made using a standard ratio and is appropriate for use in situations when ORS must be prepared without the standard ingredients. \nThe Rehydration Project says that making it a bit too thin (using more than 1 liter of fluid) is not bad for the sick person. \nThe best fluid is plain, clean water. However, fluids such as rice water, coconut water, vegetable broth, yogurt, weak unsweetened tea, unsweetened fresh fruit juice or even non-drinking water are recommended when plain, clean water is unavailable. Water can be made safe with chlorine, or by boiling it. However, ORS should still be given even if the water is maybe unsafe. Rehydration is more important. \nThe molar ratio of sugar to salt should be 1:1 and the solution should not be hyperosmolar. The Mayo clinic suggests half a teaspoon of salt, six level teaspoons of sugar and water. The British Columbia health service suggests 1 part fruit juice without sugar, mixed with 4 parts water."}

With John Everett Millais, they sought to revitalise art. They favoured the detailed observation of the natural world, in a spirit of devotion to thetruth. This almost religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of mediaeval art. It was in opposition to the rationalism of the Renaissance, as in Raphael. \nHunt's works were not successful at first, and were widely attacked in the art press. They were thought clumsy and ugly. All the same, his was noticed for the naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as \"The Hireling Shepherd\" and \"The Awakening Conscience\". However, it was with his religious paintings that he became famous, initially \"The Light of the World\" (1851\u20131853), now in the chapel at Keble College, Oxford; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in St Paul's Cathedral.\nIn the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the Holy Land in search of material for more religious works, and to \u201cuse my powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ\u2019s history and teaching\u201d. there he painted \"The Scapegoat\", \"The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple\" and \"The Shadow of Death\", along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as \"Isabella, or the Pot of Basil\" and \"The Lady of Shalott\". He eventually built his own house in Jerusalem.\nHis auction record is \u00a31,700,000, set at Sotheby's, London on 11 February 1994, for reduced-size version his 1873 work \"The Shadow of Death\".\nArtistic style.\nHis paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid colour and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Out of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximise the popular appeal and public visibility of his works.\nHe eventually had to give up painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not get the level of quality that he wanted. His last major works, \"The Lady of Shalott\" and a large version of \"The Light of the World\" were completed with the help of his assistant, Edward Robert Hughes."}

The species is relatively common in many areas, but is considered to be \"near threatened\" by IUCN.\nThe cat was examined and described by the early 19th century French anatomist \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. He collected it on an expedition to South America.\nEcology and distribution.\nGeoffroy's cats live in the Andes, Pampas (scrubby forest parts), and Gran Chaco landscape. They are found from southern Bolivia to the Straits of Magellan, at heights from sea level to . They prefer open woodland or scrubland habitats with plenty of cover, but are also found in grasslands and marshy areas. Although they are able to climb trees, they rarely do so, except to leave faeces to scent mark their territory.\nGeoffroy's cat is nocturnal. It eats rodents, hares, small lizards, insects, and occasionally frogs and fish. Like other small cats, it is a solitary hunter, and only comes together during the mating season. Females have territories ranging from , while males have larger ranges, reaching up to ."}

{"id": "457302", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457302", "title": "Civil Rights Movement", "text": "The Civil Rights Movement was a social movement in the United States that tried to gain equal rights for African Americans. The movement is famous for using non-violent protests and civil disobedience (peacefully refusing to follow unfair laws). Activists used strategies like boycotts, sit-ins, and protest marches. Sometimes police or racist white people would attack them, but the activists never fought back.\nHowever, the Civil Rights Movement was made up of many different people and groups. Not everyone believed the same things. For example, the Black Power movement believed black people should demand their civil rights and force white leaders to give them those rights.\nThe Civil Rights Movement was also made of people of different races and religions. The Movement's leaders and most of its activists were African-American. However, the Movement got political and financial support from labor unions, religious groups, and some white politicians, like Lyndon B. Johnson. Activists of all races came to join African-Americans in marches, sit-ins, and protests.\nThe Civil Rights Movement was very successful. It helped to get five federal laws and two amendments to the Constitution passed. These officially protected African Americans' rights. It also helped change many white people's attitudes about the way black people were treated and the rights they deserved.\nBefore the Civil Rights Movement.\nBefore the American Civil War, there were almost four million black slaves in the United States. Only white men with property could vote, and only white people could be United States citizens.\nAfter the Civil War, the United States government passed three Constitutional amendments:\nIn the South.\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. government tried to enforce the rights of ex-slaves in the South through a process called Reconstruction. However, in 1877, Reconstruction ended. By the 1890s, the Southern states' legislatures were all-white again. Southern Democrats, who did not support civil rights for blacks, completely ruled the South. This gave them a lot of power in the United States Congress. For example, Southern Democrats were able to make sure that laws against lynching did not pass.\nStarting in 1890, Southern Democrats began to pass state laws that took away the rights African Americans had gained. These racist laws became known as Jim Crow laws. For example, they included:\nIn 1896, the United States Supreme Court ruled in a case called \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" that these laws were legal. They said that having things be \"separate but equal\" was fine. In the South, everything was separate. However, places like black schools and libraries got much less money and were not as good as places for whites. Things were separate, but not equal.\nViolence against black people increased. Individuals, groups, police, and huge crowds of people could hurt or even kill African Americans, without the government trying to stop them or punishing them. Lynchings became more common.\nAcross the United States.\nProblems were worst in the South. However, social discrimination and tensions affected African Americans in other areas as well.\nSegregation in housing was a problem across the United States. Many African Americans could not get mortgages to buy houses. Realtors would not sell black people houses in the suburbs, where white people lived. They also would not rent apartments in white areas. Until the 1950s, the federal government did nothing about this.\nWhen he was elected in 1913, President Woodrow Wilson made government offices segregated. He believed that segregation was best for everyone.\nBlack people fought in both World War I and World War II. However, the military was segregated, and they were not given the same opportunities as white soldiers. After activism from black veterans, President Harry Truman de-segregated the military in 1948.\nEarly activism.\nAfrican Americans tried to fight back against discrimination in many ways. They formed new groups and tried to form labor unions. They tried to use the courts to get justice. For example, in 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was created. It fought to end race discrimination through lawsuits, education, and lobbying.\nHowever, eventually, many African Americans became frustrated and began to dislike the idea of using slow, legal strategies to achieve desegregation. Instead, African American activists decided to use a combination of protests, nonviolence, and civil disobedience. This is how the Civil Rights Movement of 1954-1968 began.\nImportant events.\n\"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954).\nSchools in the South, and some other parts of the country, had been segregated since 1896. In that year, the Supreme Court had ruled in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" that segregation was legal, as long as things were \"separate but equal.\"\nIn 1951, thirteen black parents filed a class action lawsuit against the Board of Education in Topeka, Kansas. In the lawsuit, the parents argued that the black and white schools were not \"separate but equal.\" They said the black school was much worse than the white one.\nThe lawsuit eventually went to the United States Supreme Court. After years of work, Thurgood Marshall and a team of other NAACP lawyers won the case. The Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools were illegal. All nine Supreme Court judges agreed.\nIn their decision, the Court said:\n\"We conclude that, in ... public education, the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\" \nThis was the Civil Rights Movement's first major victory. However, \"Brown\" did not reverse \"Plessy v. Ferguson.\" Brown made segregation in schools illegal. But segregation in all other places was still legal.\nThe Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956).\nCivil rights leaders focused on Montgomery, Alabama, because the segregation there was so extreme. On December 1, 1955, local black leader Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a public bus to make room for a white passenger. Parks and was a civil rights activist and NAACP member; she had just returned from a training on nonviolent civil disobedience. She was arrested.\nAfrican-Americans gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott. They decided they would not ride on the buses again until they were treated the same as whites. Under segregation, blacks could not sit in front of whites - they had to sit in the back of the bus. Also, if a white person told a black person to move so they could sit down, the black person had to.\nMost of Montgomery's 50,000 African Americans took part in the boycott. It lasted for 381 days and almost bankrupt the bus system. Meanwhile, the NAACP had been working on a lawsuit about segregation on buses. In 1956, they won the case, and the Supreme Court ordered Alabama to de-segregate its buses. The boycott ended with a victory.\nDe-segregating Little Rock Central High School (1957).\nIn 1957, the NAACP had signed up nine African American students (called the \"Little Rock Nine\") to go to Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Before this, only whites were allowed at the school. However, the Little Rock School Board had agreed to follow the Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" and de-segregate its schools.\nThen came the black students' first day of school. The Governor of Arkansas called out soldiers from the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the black students from even entering the school. This was against a Supreme Court ruling, so President Dwight D. Eisenhower got involved. He took control of the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to leave the school. Then he sent soldiers from the United States Army to protect the students. This was an important civil rights victory. It meant the federal government was willing to get involved and force states to end segregation in schools.\nUnfortunately, the Little Rock Nine were treated very badly by many of the white students at the school. At the end of the school year, Little Rock Central High School closed so it would not have to allow black students the next year. Other schools across the South did the same thing.\nSit-ins (1958-1960).\nBetween 1958 and 1960, activists used sit-ins to protest segregation at lunch counters (small restaurants inside stores). They would sit at the lunch counter and politely ask to buy some food. When they were told to leave, they would continue to sit quietly at the counter. Often they would stay until the lunch counter closed. Groups of activists would keep coming back to sit in at the same places until those places agreed to serve African Americans at their lunch counters.\nIn 1958, the NAACP organized the first sit-in in Wichita, Kansas. They sat in at a lunch counter in a store called Dockum's Drug Store. After three weeks, they got the store to de-segregate. Not long after, all of the Dockum Drug Stores in Kansas were de-segregated. Next, students in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma led a successful sit-in at another drug store.\nIn 1960, college students (including some white students) began to sit in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. After a while, they began to sit in at other lunch counters. In the stores that held these lunch counters, sales dropped by one-third. These stores de-segregated to avoid continuing to lose money. After five months of sit-ins, the Woolworth's in Greensboro also de-segregated its lunch counter. Newspapers all over the country wrote about the Greensboro sit-ins. Soon, people started sitting in across the South.\nA few days after the Greensboro students started their sit-in, students in Nashville, Tennessee began their own sit-ins. They chose stores in the part of Nashville that had the most businesses. Before starting their sit-ins, they decided they would not be violent, no matter what. They wrote out rules, which activists in other cities began to use also. Their rules said:\n\"Do not [hit] back or curse if abused. ... Do not block entrances to stores outside [or] the aisles inside. [Be polite] and friendly at all times. Do sit straight; always face the counter. ... Do refer information seekers to your leader in a polite manner. Remember the teachings of Jesus, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. Love and nonviolence is the way.\"\nMany of the Nashville students were attacked and abused by groups of white people; arrested; and even beaten by police. However, the students were always nonviolent. Their protests, and the attacks on them, brought more newspaper stories and attention. It also showed how the activists were truly nonviolent. After three months of sit-ins, all of the lunch counters in Nashville's downtown department stores were de-segregated.\nSoon, there were sit-ins all over the country. Sit-ins even happened in Nevada, and in northern states like Ohio. Over 70,000 people, black and white, took part in sit-ins. They used sit-ins to protest all kinds of segregated places - not just lunch counters, but also beaches, parks, museums, libraries, swimming pools, and other public places.\nThe sit-ins even got the support of President Eisenhower. After the Greensboro sit-ins started, he said he was \"deeply sympathetic with the efforts of any group to enjoy the rights of equality that they are guaranteed by the Constitution.\"\nIn April 1960, students who had led sit-ins were invited to a conference. At the conference, they decided to form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). SNCC would become an important group in the civil rights movement.\nFreedom Rides (1961).\nIn 1960, the Supreme Court had ruled in \"Boynton v. Virginia\" that it was illegal to segregate people on public transportation that was going from one state to another. In 1961, student activists decided to test whether the Southern states would follow this ruling. Groups of black and white activists decided to ride buses through the South, sitting together instead of segregating themselves. They planned to ride buses from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans, Louisiana. They called these rides the \"Freedom Rides.\"\nThe Freedom Riders were met with danger and violence. For example:\nThe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) brought in more Freedom Riders to keep the movement going. They were also met with violence:\nA new law.\nHowever, people around the country began to support the Freedom Riders, who had never used violence, even when being attacked. Eventually, Robert Kennedy, the Attorney General in his brother John F. Kennedy's government, insisted on a new law about de-segregation. It said that:\nVoter registration (1961-1965).\nBetween 1961 and 1965, activist groups worked on trying to get black people registered (signed up) to vote. Since the end of Reconstruction, the Southern states had passed laws and used many strategies to keep black people from registering to vote. Often, these laws did not apply to white people.\nVoter registration activists started out in Mississippi. All of Mississippi's civil rights organizations joined together to try to get people registered. Activist groups in Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina then started similar programs. However, when the activists tried to register black people to vote, police, white racists, and the Ku Klux Klan beat, arrested, shot, and even murdered them.\nMeanwhile, black people who tried to register to vote were fired from their jobs, thrown out of their homes, beaten, arrested, threatened, and sometimes murdered.\nIn 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. It made discrimination illegal, and specifically said it was illegal to have different voter registration requirements for different races. However, even after this law was passed, the Southern states still made it very difficult for black people to vote. Finally, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed. This law included ways to make sure that all United States citizens were getting their right to vote.\nIntegrating Mississippi universities (19561965).\nStarting in 1956, a black man named Clyde Kennard wanted to go to Mississippi Southern College. Kennard had served in the Korean War, and he wanted to use the GI Bill to go to college. The college's president, William McCain, asked state politicians and a local racist group who supported segregation to make sure Kennard never got into the college.\nKenner was arrested twice for crimes he never committed. Eventually he was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. After Kennard had spent three years in prison doing forced labor, Governor Ross Barnett pardoned him. Journalists had looked into Kennard's case, and wrote that the state did not give Kennard the treatment he needed for his colon cancer. Kennard died that same year. Later, in 2006, a court ruled that Kennard was innocent of the crimes he had been sent to jail for.\nIn September 1962, James Meredith won a lawsuit that gave him the right to go to the University of Mississippi. He tried three times to get into the university to sign up for classes. Governor Ross Barnett blocked Meredith each time. He told Meredith: \"[N]o school will be integrated in Mississippi while I am your Governor.\"\nAttorney General Robert Kennedy sent United States Marshals to protect Meredith. On September 30, 1962, Meredith was able to enter the college with the Marshals protecting him. However, that evening, students and other racist whites started a riot. They threw rocks and fired guns at the Marshals. Two people were killed; 28 marshals were shot; and another 160 people were hurt. President John F. Kennedy sent the United States Army to the school to stop the riot. Meredith was able to begin classes at the college the day after the Army arrived. Meredith survived harassment and isolation at the college and graduated on August 18, 1963, with a a degree in political science.\nMeredith and other activists kept working on de-segregating public universities. In 1965, the first two African American students were able to go to the University of Southern Mississippi.\nBirmingham Campaign (1963).\nIn 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) started a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama. Its goals were to de-segregate the stores in downtown Birmingham; make hiring fair; and create a committee, including blacks and whites, that would make a plan for de-segregating Birmingham's schools. Martin Luther King described Birmingham as \"probably the most [completely] segregated city in the United States.\"\nBirmingham's Commissioner of Public Safety was Eugene \"Bull\" Connor. (A Commissioner of Public Safety is in charge of the police and fire department, and deals with emergencies that could be dangerous to people in the city.) Connor was very much against integration. He often let the police, Ku Klux Klan, and racist white people attack civil rights activists. He promised that blacks and whites would never be integrated in Birmingham.\nThe activists used a few different non-violent ways of protesting, including sit-ins, \"kneel-ins\" at local churches, and marches.p.\u00a0218 However, the city got a court order saying all protests like this were illegal. The activists knew this was illegal, and in an act of civil disobedience, they refused to follow the court order.p.\u00a0108 The protesters, including Martin Luther King, were arrested.\nWhile in jail, King was held in solitary confinement. While there, he wrote his famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" He was let go after about a week.\nThe Children's Crusade.\nHowever, very few activists could afford to risk being arrested. One of SCLC's leaders then came up with the idea of training high school, college, and elementary school students to take part in the protests. He reasoned that students did not have full-time jobs to go to, they did not have families to take care of, and they could \"afford\" to be in jail more than their parents.\n\"Newsweek\" magazine later named this plan the \"Children's Crusade.\" On May 2, more than 600 students, including some as young as 8 years old, tried to march from a local church to City Hall. They were all arrested.\nThe next day, another 1,000 students started to march. Bull Connor let police dogs loose to attack them and used fire hoses to knock down the students. Reporters were there, and videos and pictures showing the violence were shown on television and printed across the country.\nAgreement.\nPeople throughout the United States were so angry at seeing these videos that President Kennedy worked with the SCLC and the white businesses in Birmingham to work out an agreement. It said:\nSome of Birmingham's whites were not happy with this agreement. They bombed the SCLC's headquarters; the home of King's brother; and a hotel where King had been staying. Thousands of blacks reacted by rioting; some burned buildings and one even stabbed and hurt a police officer.p.\u00a0301\nOn September 15, 1963, the Ku Klux Klan bombed a church in Birmingham, where civil rights activists often met before starting their marches. Since it was a Sunday, church services were going on. The bomb killed four young girls and hurt 22 other people.\n\"Rising tide of discontent\" (1963).\nDuring the spring and summer of 1963, there were protests in over a hundred United States cities, including Northern cities. There were riots in Chicago after a white police officer shot a 14-year-old black boy who was running away from the scene of a robbery. In Philadelphia and Harlem, black activists and white workers fought when the activists tried to integrate state-run construction projects. On June 6, over a thousand white people attacked a sit-in in North Carolina; black activists fought back, and a white man was killed.\nIn Cambridge, Maryland, white leaders declared martial law to stop fighting between blacks and whites. Attorney General Robert Kennedy had to get involved to create an agreement to de-segregate the city.\nOn June 11, 1963, Alabama Governor George Wallace actually stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama to stop its first two black students from getting inside. President Kennedy had to send United States soldiers to make him get out of the doorway, and make sure that the black students could get into the school.\nMeanwhile, the Kennedy government had become very worried. Black leaders had told Robert Kennedy that it was getting harder and harder for African Americans to be nonviolent when they were getting attacked, and when it was taking so long for the United States government to help them get their civil rights. On the evening of June 11, President Kennedy gave a speech about civil rights. He talked about \"a rising tide of discontent [unhappiness] that threatens the public safety.\" He asked Congress to pass new civil rights laws. He also asked Americans to support civil rights as \"a moral issue ... in our daily lives.\"\nIn the early morning of June 12, Medgar Evers, a leader of the Mississippi NAACP, was murdered by a Ku Klux Klan member.p.\u00a0113 The next week, President Kennedy gave Congress his Civil Rights bill, and asked them to make it into law.p.\u00a0126\nThe March on Washington (1963).\nIn 1963, civil rights leaders planned a protest march in Washington, D.C. All of the major civil rights groups, some labor unions, and other liberal groups cooperated in planning the march. The march's full name was \"The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\" The goals for the march were to get civil rights laws passed; to get the U.S. government to create more jobs; and to get equal, good housing, education, jobs, and voting rights for everyone. However, the most important goal was to get President Kennedy's civil rights law passed.p.\u00a0159\nMany people thought it would be impossible for so many activists to come together without violence and rioting. The United States government got 19,000 soldiers ready nearby, in case of riots. Hospitals got ready to treat huge numbers of injured people. The government made selling alcohol in Washington, D.C., illegal for the day.p.\u00a0159\nThe March on Washington was one of the largest non-violent protests for human rights in United States history. Martin Luther King, Jr., thought that having 100,000 marchers would make the event successful. On August 28, 1963, about 250,000 activists from all over the country came together for the march. The marchers included about 60,000 white people (including church groups and labor union members), and between 75 and 100 members of Congress.p.\u00a0160 Together, they marched from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. There, they listened to civil rights leaders speak.\nMartin Luther King, Jr., spoke last. His speech, called \"I Have a Dream,\" became one of history's most famous civil rights speeches.\nHistorians have said that the March on Washington helped get President Kennedy's civil rights bill passed.\nMalcolm X joins the movement (1964).\nMalcolm X was an American minister who converted to Islam in prison, around 1948. He became a member of the Nation of Islam.p.\u00a0138 This group believed in black supremacy - that the black race was the best of all. They believed that blacks should be completely independent from whites, and should eventually return to Africa.pp.127\u2013128, 132\u2013138pp.\u00a0149\u2013152 They also believed that black people had the right to fight back and use violence to get their rights. Because of this, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam did not support the civil rights movement, because it was non-violent and supported integration.pp.\u00a079\u201380\nHowever, in March 1964, Malcolm X was kicked out of the Nation of Islam, because he had disagreements with the group's leader, Elijah Muhammad. He offered to work with other civil rights groups, if they accepted that blacks had the right to defend themselves.\nOn March 26, 1964, Malcolm met with Martin Luther King, Jr. Malcolm had a plan to bring the United States before the United Nations on charges that the U.S. violated African Americans' human rights. Dr. King may have been planning to support this.\nBetween 1963 and 1964, civil rights activists got more angry and more likely to fight back against whites. In April 1964, Malcolm gave a famous speech called \"The Ballot or the Bullet.\" (\"The ballot\" means \"voting.\") In the speech, he said that if the U.S. government is \"unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of Negroes,\" then African Americans should defend themselves.p.\u00a043 He warned politicians that many African Americans were not willing \"to turn the other cheek any longer.\"p.\u00a025 Then he warned white America about what would happen if blacks were not allowed to vote:\n&lt;br&gt;\nMississippi Freedom Summer (1964).\nIn the summer of 1964, civil rights groups brought almost 1,000 activists to Mississippi. Most of them were white college students.p.\u00a066 Their goals were to work together with black activists to register voters, and to teach summer school to black children in \"Freedom Schools.\" They also wanted to help create the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). At the time, only white people could take part in the Mississippi Democratic Party. The MFDP was planned as another political party that would allow black and white Democrats to take part in politics.\nMany white Mississippians were angry that people from other states were coming in and trying to change their society. Government workers, police, the Ku Klux Klan, and other racist whites used many strategies to attack the activists and black people who were trying to register to vote. The Freedom Summer project lasted for ten weeks. During that time, 1,062 activists were arrested; 80 were beaten; and 4 were killed. Three black Mississippians were murdered because they supported civil rights. Thirty-seven churches, and thirty black homes or businesses, were bombed or burned.\nOn June 21, 1964, three Freedom Summer activists disappeared. Weeks later, their bodies were found. They had been murdered by members of the local Ku Klux Klan - including some who were also police in the Neshoba County sheriff's department. When people were searching for their bodies in local swamps and rivers, they found the bodies of a 14-year-old boy and seven other men who also seemed to have been murdered at some time.\nDuring Freedom Summer, activists set up at least 30 Freedom Schools, and taught about 3,500 students. The students included children, adults, and the elderly. The schools taught about many things, like black history; civil rights; politics; the freedom movement; and the basic reading and writing skills needed to vote.\nAlso during the summer, about 17,000 black Mississippians tried to register to vote. Only 1,600 were able to. However, more than 80,000 joined the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). This showed that they wanted to vote and take part in politics, not just let white people do it for them.\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.\nJohn F. Kennedy's suggested civil rights bill had support from Northern members of Congress - both Democrats and Republicans. However, Southern Senators blocked the suggested law from passing. They filibustered for 54 days to block the bill from becoming a law. Finally, President Lyndon B. Johnson got a bill to pass.\nOn July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law said:\nKing awarded Nobel Peace Prize (1964).\nIn December 1964, Martin Luther King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. When giving him the award, the Chairman of the Nobel Committee said:\nSelma to Montgomery Marches (1965).\nIn January 1965, Martin Luther King and the SCLC went to Selma, Alabama. Civil rights groups there had asked them to come help get black people registered to vote. At the time, 99% of the people registered to vote in Selma were white. Together, they started working on voting rights.\nHowever, the next month, an African-American man named Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot by a police officer during a peaceful march. Jackson died.pp.\u00a0121\u2013123 Many African-American people were very angry. The SCLC was worried that people were so angry that they would get violent.\nThe SCLC decided to organize a march from Selma to Montgomery. This would be a 54-mile (87-kilometer) march. Activists hoped the march would show how badly African-Americans wanted to vote. They also wanted to show that they would not let racism or violence stop them from getting equal rights.\nThe first march was on March 7, 1965. Police officers and racist whites attacked the marchers with clubs and tear gas. They threatened to throw the marchers off the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Seventeen marchers had to go to the hospital, and 50 others were also injured. This day came to be called Bloody Sunday. Pictures and film of the marchers being beaten were shown in newspapers and on television around the world.\nSeeing these things made more people support the civil rights activists. People came from all over the United States to march with the activists. One of them, James Reeb, was attacked by white people for supporting civil rights. He died on March 11, 1965.\nFinally, President Johnson decided to send soldiers from the United States Army and the Alabama National Guard to protect the marchers. From March 21 to March 25, the marchers walked along the \"Jefferson Davis Highway\" from Selma to Montgomery. On March 25, 25,000 people entered Montgomery. Martin Luther King gave a speech called \"How Long? Not Long\" at the Alabama State Capitol. He told the marchers that it would not be long before they had equal rights, \"because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"\nAfter the march, Viola Liuzzo, a white woman from Detroit, drove some other marchers to the airport. While she was driving back, she was murdered by three members of the Ku Klux Klan.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nOn August 6, 1965, the United States passed the Voting Rights Act. This law made it illegal to stop somebody from voting because of their race. This meant that all the state laws that kept black people from voting were now illegal.\nFor almost 100 years, registrars (the government workers who had registered people to vote) were all white. They had total power over who they could register and who they would not register. If a registrar refused to let a black person register, that person could only file a lawsuit, which they were not likely to win. However, the Voting Rights Act finally made a change to this system. If a registrar discriminated against black people, the Attorney General could send federal workers to replace local registrars.\nThe law worked right away. Within a few months, 250,000 new black voters had signed up to vote. One out of every three of them was registered by a federal worker who replaced a racist registrar. In 1965, 74% of Mississippi's black voters actually voted, and more black politicians were elected in Mississippi than in any other state. By 1967, most African Americans were registered to vote in 9 of the 13 states in the South.\nPolitics in the South were completely changed by African Americans having the power to vote. White politicians could no longer make laws about African Americans without blacks having a say. In many parts of the South, black people outnumbered whites. This meant that they could vote in black politicians, and vote out racist whites. Also, black people who were registered to vote could be on juries. Before this, any time an African American was charged with a crime, the jury that decided whether they were guilty would be all-white.\nFair housing movements (1966-1968).\nFrom 1966 to 1968, the civil rights movement focused a lot on fair housing. Even outside the South, fair housing was a problem. For example, in 1963, California passed a Fair Housing Act which made segregation in housing illegal. White voters and real estate lobbyists got the law reversed the next year. This helped cause the Watts Riots. (Later, in 1966, California made the Fair Housing Act the law again.)\nActivists, including Martin Luther King, led a movement for fair housing in Chicago in 1966. The next year, young NAACP members did the same in Milwaukee. Activists in both cities got attacked physically by white homeowners, and legally by politicians who supported segregation.\nThe Fair Housing Bill.\nOf all the civil rights laws passed during the Civil Rights Movement, the Fair Housing Act was the hardest to pass. The law would make discrimination in housing illegal. This meant black people would be allowed to move into white neighborhoods. As Senator Walter Mondale said: \"This was civil rights getting personal.\"\nThe suggested Fair Housing Bill was sent to the United States Senate first. There, most Senators - Northern and Southern - were against the bill. In March of 1968, the Senate sent a weaker version to the House of Representatives. The House was expected to make changes that would make the bill even weaker.\nThat did not happen. On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King was murdered. This made many members of Congress feel like they needed to do something about civil rights quickly. The day after Dr. King's murder, Senator Mondale stood in front of the Senate and said:\nOn April 10, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968. President Johnson signed the law the next day. Part of the law is called the \"Fair Housing Act.\" It makes it illegal to discriminate in selling, renting, or lending money for housing, based on a person's race, skin color, religion, or home country.\nThe King assassination and the Poor People's Campaign (1968).\nIn 1968, Martin Luther King and the SCLC were planning the Poor People's Campaign. People of all races took part in the movement. The movement's goal was to decrease poverty for people of all races.\nAs part of his work against poverty, Dr. King and the SCLC started to speak out against the Vietnam War. King argued that poor people in Vietnam were being killed, and that the War would only make them poorer. He also argued that the United States was spending more and more money and time on the War, and less on programs to help poor Americans.\nIn March 1968, Dr. King was invited to Memphis, Tennessee to support garbage workers that were on strike. These workers were paid very little, and two workers had been killed doing their jobs. They wanted to be members of a labor union. Dr. King thought this strike was a perfect fit for his Poor People's Campaign. As soon as he got to Memphis, King started getting threats.\nThe day before he was murdered, King gave a sermon called \"I've Been to the Mountaintop.\" The next day he was murdered. After King was killed, people rioted in more than 100 cities across the United States.\nCivil rights leader Ralph Abernathy continued the Poor People's Campaign after King's death. About 3,000 activists camped out on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for about six weeks.\nThe day before Dr. King's funeral, his wife, Coretta Scott King, and three of their children led 20,000 marchers through Memphis. Soldiers protected the marchers. On April 9, Mrs. King led another 150,000 people through Atlanta during Dr. King's funeral. An old, wooden wagon, pulled by mules, pulled Dr. King's casket. The wagon was a symbol of Dr. King's Poor People's Campaign.\nMrs. King once said:\nDeaths.\nMany people were killed during the Civil Rights Movement. Some were killed because they supported civil rights. Others were killed by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) or other racist whites who wanted to terrorize black people. No one knows just how many people were killed during the Civil Rights Movement. However, here are some examples. People whose names are highlighted in blue were children or teenagers when they were killed.\nAn unknown number of other people died or were killed during the Civil Rights Movement."}

{"id": "457348", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457348", "title": "Rice Park, Saint Paul, Minnesota", "text": "Rice Park is a public park located in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\nHistory.\nBefore it became a park, Rice Park was used as an open space to dry laundry and graze animals. The land was eventually made into a \"public square\" in 1849 by John R. Irvine, a territorial pioneer and Henry M. Rice, territorial delegate and United States Senator. The park was named after early Minnesota Senator Henry M. Rice. Rice park sits atop a small hill where glacial melt failed to erode completely. The park was mostly ignored until 1860 when Mayor John S. Prince had shade trees planted. In the 1870s the park got a fountain and a bandstand. A pair of squirrels were given to the park by the chief of police in Memphis, Tennessee as an act of goodwill. Eventually, electric lights were installed in 1883. This was on the occasion of the visit by President Chester A. Arthur, former president Ulysses S. Grant, and General William Tecumseh Sherman, at the opening of Northern Pacific's West Coast rail line. The historic buildings, museums, and music halls that border the park were constructed over a period of nearly 100 years. On May 10, 1903 Saint Paul Globe reported that Rice Park was the traditional place in St. Paul for newly engaged couples to go and sit. The Women\u2019s Institute of Saint Paul donated a new fountain to the park on June 14, 1965. Minnesota sculptor Alonzo Hauser designed the fountain, titled 'the Source', with a statue of a woman in the water. Rice Park has been honored as a Great Place in America by the American Planning Association in 2011.\nLocation and Features.\nRice Park is about 2 acres in size. It is located at 4th Street and Washington Street in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota.\nRice Park sits above the Mississippi River\u2019s highest flood level, so its surroundings are important buildings like the Federal Customs House (now Landmark Center), Central Public Library, and the grand St. Paul Hotel. More recently the park was given character sculptures from the Peanuts cartoons to honor the birthplace of Peanuts cartoonist Charles Schulz. It also has an ice rink during the winter months. Rice Park forms a pathway between eight different significant buildings, adding to its popularity.\nActivities and Events.\nRice Park was placed right in the heart of the busy city of Saint Paul. The park is used year-round. During the summer, music, specifically blues, jazz, and original composition, can be heard at noon on various Mondays starting in June. The park has an annual Winter Carnival, one of the oldest and largest winter festivals in the country. These activities include a tree lighting ceremony, ice skating, watching fireworks, listening to holiday music and family-friendly activities. Rice Park is also available for private parties and gatherings. It can accommodate a wedding party of up to 200 people.\nIn addition, several events have been located at Rice Park. For instance, the funeral of Charles Luth, a switchman who was murdered during the Pullman strike, was held at the park in 1894."}

Other titles for this position include Commissioner, Superintendent, and Chief Constable. A Chief of Police is usually a municipal employee of a city or town. In contrast, a U.S. Sheriff is generally elected by the voters of a county. Some states have both an appointed and an elected Chief of Police (Louisiana). The fraternal organization International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) is an organization often associated with many Chiefs of Police.\nDuties.\nA police chief is the top executive officer in a police department. The job of a chief, no matter what the size of the police department, is to protect their community. A chief is responsible for the budget of a police department. He or she is also responsible for the conduct of all police officers in the department. In larger police departments, a chief can delegate some of his responsibilities to an assistant Chief (Deputy Chief, etc.). \nUnited Kingdom.\nChief police officer is a phrase used in the United Kingdom to describe the position of the most senior police officer in a police force. It refers to the 53 Chief Constables, the Commissioner of the City of London Police or the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. They are members of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The phrase is used in legislation on the power to permit public processions, or grant firearms licenses. Many routine activities are delegated to constables.\nNo police officers in the UK are elected. There is a mixed system of control by local and central government, and local committees act in advice and supervision. Various organisations are permitted to hire and control their own security forces: the armed forces, the railways, certain branches of the security services, and a number of private organisations. \nNorth America.\nPolicing in Canada is usually the responsibility of the province. Usually police chiefs run the police departments. In eight of Canada's ten provinces the Royal Canadian Mounted Police act as regional police. They also act as the municipal police in the three territories and in many towns in British Columbia. In the province of Ontario, a Chief of Police must be a sworn police officer.\nChiefs of police in the United States have two unique opportunities for training for the position. The FBI offers executive police training at their academy. The University of Louisville has the Southern Police Institute. Police chiefs of larger cities often work for a police commissioner. In those cases the chief of police manages the day-to-day business of the police department. The chief may also work for a board of commissioners.\nOther countries.\nIn Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria, the chief of police is a Cabinet minister position. In many parts of the world Interpol has taken a role in organizing regional councils of police chiefs. They work in close cooperation with police chiefs to exchange methods and ideas. Many councils take these ideas directly to their governments which often put them into effect. Regional and sub-regional chiefs of police councils are set up in most parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. North and South American have functioning councils that work with Interpol. Central American councils are a work in progress."}

It has had various changes of name, while its function has stayed much the same.\nIt was formed in London in 1883. Branches were formed in Ireland (before the Republic of Ireland was founded) and later Northern Ireland. The Metropolitan Police had their own Special Branch, until it was merged with the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13) to form Counter Terrorism Command or SO15 in 2006.\nThe main function for all these branches was to collect evidence and arrest the enemies of the United Kingdom who lived on home territory. Historically, these have been the IRA (and its splinter braches), Soviet and Russian intelligence agents, and Islamic extremists and terrorists.\nSpecial Branch has contact with the Security Service and the Home Office. They use the prefix \"Detective\" in front of their ranks, and are governed by the same laws as the general police. Under British law, MI5 officers are not permitted actually to lay hands on members of the public. Observations, wire taps (\"lawful interception\"), arrests, interrogations and preparing cases for prosecution are usually done by the Special Branch.\nSpecial Branch have responsibility for the personal protection of (non-royal) VIPs, and are examining officers at designated ports and airports, as prescribed by the Terrorism Act 2000.\nThe intelligence work of Special Branch sits somewhere between that of the Security Service and that of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13). It was announced, in September 2005, that the Metropolitan Police Special Branch would be merging with the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Metropolitan Police to form a new department called Counter Terrorism Command. The new department came into being on 2 October 2006.\nMost, if not all UK police services still maintain a Special Branch. Strathclyde Police had a Special Branch until it was renamed the Counter Terrorist Intelligence Section."}

That means the dog tribe, known as the Canini. It does not apply to foxes (the tribe Vulpini). Other caniforms (Caniformia) live singly or come together at mating times, with some exceptions (like the badger).\nSo, not all canids form packs. If they do, the size of the pack, and the social behaviour in the pack varies by species. The animals in the pack know each other. Always there is a hierarchy of dominance inside the pack. The classic case is the grey wolf. All packs are united by genetic relationship: they are family members.\nOne reason why some mammalian predators evolved group behaviour is that their prey lives in massive herds on grassland. The most notable predators on grassland are the wolves and jackals (caniforms) and the lions and hyaenas (feliforms). The same principle works with aquatic predators: if their prey goes in shoals or family groups, then the predators go in groups. "}

In an at the end of the movie, the former cast members are reunited at Mickey's Diner. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.\nProduction notes.\nTo receive insurance for the shoot, Robert Altman had to hire Paul Thomas Anderson. He was a \"backup\" director who could take over if Altman could not work, The movie had the working title \"The Last Show\". Principal photography started on June 29, 2005, at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. That is where the radio show is broadcast from. Filming ended on July 28, 2005. The movie was the second major picture to be filmed in Minnesota in 2005. (The first was \"North Country\", starring Charlize Theron and Harrelson,)\nThe Fitzgerald is a rather small building. Because of that, the movie makers thought about using other stage theaters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. With some effort, the necessary movie equipment was crammed into the structure. The basement was also used for sets due to lack of space. Set design had to make the show more visually interesting. Fake dressing rooms were used in the movie. The movie's production designer noted that Keillor's actual dressing room is \"about the size of a very, very small bathroom\". Mickey's Diner, a downtown St. Paul landmark, is also in the movie.\nOn November 1, 2005, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that an early screening in New York City for movie distributors resulted in a heavy bidding war. Picturehouse bought the rights. Company president Bob Berney, \"aiming to capitalize on the name recognition of the 31-year-old radio program, recommended that the title revert to \"A Prairie Home Companion\". 'At the screening, Garrison said that to broaden the movie's appeal, they were thinking about changing the name to \"Savage Love\", so we may have an argument there,' Berney said.\"\nReception.\nCritics.\n\"A Prairie Home Companion\" opened the 2006 South by Southwest movie festival on March 10. It then premiered in St. Paul, on May 3, 2006, at the Fitzgerald Theater. The movie's stars arrived in ten horse-drawn carriages. Brian Williams of \"NBC Nightly News\" did his newscast from neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota, that night so that he could attend.\nCritics' general reaction to the movie was favorable. It got an 81% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave the movie four out of four stars. He wrote, \"What a lovely film this is, so gentle and whimsical, so simple and profound\". Ebert later added the movie to his \"Great Movies\" list.\nMichael Medved gave the movie one and a half stars out of four. He wrote, \"The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent\" and \"[it may be] the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count \u2018em \u2013 four!) Oscar winners\".\nDesson Thomson from \"The Washington Post\" said that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.\nAwards.\nMeryl Streep won the Best Supporting Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics for her role. Altman was also posthumously nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Director.\nBox office.\nThe movie had a successful limited release in the United States. It grossed $20,338,609 in the United States. It grossed $25,978,442 worldwide.\nHome media.\nThe movie's DVD was released on October 10, 2006. Special features included deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and commentary by Altman and Kline. \"A Prairie Home Companion Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was released on May 23, 2006, by New Line."}

He was fascinated by their \"talking leaves,\" which was their writing system on paper. He wanted to make an alphabet for Cherokees to communicate too. He began making it around 1809. First he tried to make a symbol for every word, like in Chinese. That required too much remembering. Then he tried to make one for every idea, but gave up. Finally he made one symbol for every syllable in the Cherokee language. He made a syllabary with 86 letters. Many of the letters look like English because he had an English book that he could not read.\nHe taught the syllabary to his daughter, Ayokeh (Ayoka). Then he tested it in front of a group of leaders. They said a word, he wrote it down, and then Ayokeh repeated them. Originally people thought it was witchcraft, but then they started liking his syllabary. Many Cherokee learned it and eventually became literate, which means they could read and write. In fact, more Cherokees could read and write better than nearby white people.\nInfluence.\nSequoyah became a hero for giving Cherokee people a written language. Cherokee is still taught and used. There are now 85 symbols, instead of the original 86."}

She \"was called the reigning queen of American poetry\" in the 1920s.\nLife.\nFamily and childhood.\nElinor Wylie was born Elinor Morton Hoyt on 7 September, 1885 in Somerville, New Jersey. She came from a prominent New Jersey family. Her parents were Henry Martyn Hoyt, Jr. and Anne Morton McMichael. Elinor was the oldest of five children.\nWhen Elinor was twelve, the family moved to Washington, D.C.. This was when her father was appointed Assistant Attorney General. Elinor went to Miss Baldwin's School near Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. She next went to Mrs. Flint's School, and Holton-Arms School, both in Washington. She graduated in 1904. At the Corcoran gallery she studied drawing. As a girl, she liked reading books. \nAdult life.\nLittle more than a year after she finished school, she married Philip Hichborn, Jr. Together they had a son, Philip Hichborn, III. But she left her husband and son in 1910. She went to England with Horace Wylie. He was a Washington lawyer, was married and was 17 years older than Elinor. The scandal was widely publicized. \nHorace's wife finally agreed to a divorce, and Hichborn committed suicide. in 1916, Elinor and Wylie returned to America and got married. In 1919, the couple moved to Washington. There she met with famous writers. They said she should publish her poetry. \nFirst she sent poems to \"Poetry\", the leading American poetry magazine.

On December 16, 1928, she suddenly died of Bright's disease in New York.\nLiterary style.\nAccording to Evelyn Hively, Elinor Wylie \"subscribed fully to the theory that a poet's work, as Wallace Stevens says, lies in trying to wrestle experience into meaning.\" \nShe admired poetry from the past. These included the Metaphysical poets and the Romantic poets. Her favorite poet was Percy Bysshe Shelley. He had a strong influence on Elinor's style. Her poetry often followed strict rules and traditions. For example, many of her poems were sonnets. She also used a lot of imagery. \nAll of Elinor's long works of fiction were allegories. They dealt with the supernatural or the strange and unusual. She called these fantasies \"fairytales\".\nWorks.\nElinor Wylie was primarily a poet, but she also wrote four successful novels, or fantasies, as well as short stories and essays."}

Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto used mobile elements, so connecting op art with kinetic (moving) structures.\nThe idea of visual illusions and effects fascinated other artists and intellectuals. The famous Dutch artist M.C. Escher drew impossible structures which worked by using visual illusions. The art historian Ernst Gombrich wrote a detailed study on visual effects in art.

There were 2 sections in first year and one section in second year as a start. There were classes held at the barangay hall and 2 classes at the elementary school. The school grows in population causing the PTA to construct a temporary classroom made of bricks to accommodate enrolls on the following school year.\nDue to the growing population, additional teachers were hired.

Last June, 2004, the new site was being occupied by the fourth year students first due to the existence of two buildings with 6 classrooms only. However, at present, all the year levels already utilized the said site.\nWith the joint effort of the school and its stakeholders the dream to be all together at the designated new site of Maria Cristina National High School is now realized."}

At each moment, the system (experiment) will be in one of several possible states. At the end, the experiment will be in a final state. At each point in time, the state of the system can be measured. \nExperiments done in quantum mechanics work the same way. The difference to classical mechanics is that at each point in time, several states are superposed (overlapping) to describe the state the experiment is in. These states are called eigenstates. In the same way as with classical mechanics, if a measurement is done, there is a single result. This result is the eigenvalue of one of the eigenstates. This means that measurement will reduce the several possible states to a single state by adding them together. After the measurement, the system will be in the state that was measured. In the Copenhagen interpretation, this reduction is known as wavefunction collapse. Collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time. The other is continuous evolution via the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nWerner Heisenberg was among the first to explain this situation, in a paper published in 1927. This result is controversial. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger used the thought experiment Schr\u00f6dinger's cat to show this controversy."}
