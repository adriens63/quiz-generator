As of the 2010 census, its population was 181,376.\nThe name comes from the Apalachee Native American words: \"talwa\" meaning town, and \"ahassee\" meaning old.\nTallahassee was created as the capital of Florida during the territory's second legislative session. It was chosen as the midpoint between St. Augustine and Pensacola, which had been the capitals of the Spanish and British colonies of East Florida and West Florida, respectively. (At that time, very few people lived in the swamps of South Florida.) The first session of Florida's Legislative Council\u2013as a territory of the United States\u2013met on July 22, 1822 at Pensacola and members from St. Augustine traveled fifty-nine days by water to attend. The second session was in St. Augustine and required western delegates to travel perilously around the peninsula on a twenty-eight day trek. During this session, it was decided that future meetings should be held at a half-way point to reduce the distance. Two appointed commissioners selected Tallahassee, at that point an abandoned Apalachee settlement, as a halfway point. In 1824, the third legislative session met there in a crude log capitol. Also in 1824, Marquis de Lafayette, French hero of the American Revolution, returned for a grand tour of the United States. The US Congress voted to give him $200,000 (the same amount he had given the colonies in 1778), US citizenship, and the Lafayette Land Grant, of land that today includes large portions of Tallahassee. In 1845, a Greek revival masonry structure was erected as the Capitol building in time for statehood.\nIn 1977, a 23-story high-rise Capitol building designed by architect Edward Durell Stone was completed. It is now the third-tallest state capitol building in the United States. In 1978, the old capitol was scheduled for demolition, but the State Of Florida decided to keep the Old Capitol as a museum and point of interest.\nThe city is the location of two important universities, Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University."}

These included \"Dancing Queen\", \"SOS\", \"Money, Money, Money\", \"Mamma Mia\", and \"Waterloo\". Most of their songs were written by Ulvaeus and Andersson.\nThey originally broke up in 1982, but their music is still popular. It has appeared in movies (including the Australian movies \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" and \"Muriel's Wedding\"). The stage musical \"Mamma Mia!\" was developed from their music and subsequently made into a 2008 movie followed ten years later by a 2018 sequel \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\"\nHistory.\nAll four ABBA members had local music careers before ABBA even formed. Frida and Agnetha were both solo singers. Benny and Bjorn both had their own individual bands. In 1966, Benny and Bjorn both met and decided to write songs together. In 1969, Bjorn met Agnetha and Benny met Frida. All four friends met together and decided to work together to record songs.

In 1974, ABBA was given a chance to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest. With \"Waterloo\", they won and soon got global success. In 1976, ABBA released Dancing Queen, which is often known as ABBA's \"signature song\" and \"one of the greatest pop songs ever written\".

Throughout the mid and late 1970's ABBA performed in Europe, The United States, Japan and Australia. In early 1979, Agnetha and Bjorn divorced. In early 1981, Frida and Benny also got divorced. This led to many sadder and more mature songs over the next few years. By 1981, ABBA's popularity was declining. Their last album, \"The Visitors\" a not a big success like previous albums. The Day Before You Came was the last song ABBA ever recorded together, while Under Attack was the last song ever released, both in 1982.

They also battled with Eastern Wu, another Chinese dynasty at this time, and during one of the battles, Guan Yu was captured by the Wu general L\u00fc Meng and executed (along with his son Guan Ping).\nIn later centuries, Guan Yu became a Chinese deity and was given the name Guan Gong, meaning \"Lord Guan\"."}

Electrons are negatively charged while protons are positively charged. Things that are negatively charged and things that are positively charged pull on (attract) each other. This makes electrons and protons stick together to form atoms. Things that have the same charge push each other away (they \"repel\" each other). This is called the \"Law of Charges\". It was discovered by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. The law that describes how strongly charges pull and push on each other is called Coulomb's Law.\nThings that have equal numbers of electrons and protons are \"neutral\". Things that have more electrons than protons are negatively charged, while things with fewer electrons than protons are positively charged. Things with the same charge repel each other. Things that have different charges attract each other. If possible, the one with too many electrons will give enough electrons to match the number of protons in the one that has too many protons for its load of electrons. If there are just enough electrons to match the extra protons, then the two things will not attract each other anymore. When electrons move from a place where there are too many to a place where there are too few, that is called an electrical current.\nWhen a person shuffles their feet on a carpet and then touches a brass doorknob, they may get an electrical shock. If there are enough extra electrons then the force with which those electrons push each other away may be enough to make some of the electrons jump across a gap between the person and the doorknob. The length of the spark is a measure of voltage or \"electrical pressure.\" The number of electrons that move from one place to another per unit of time measured as amperage or \"rate of electron flow.\"\nIf a person gets a positive or negative charge, it may make the person's hairs stand up because the charges in each hair push it away from the others.\nElectric charge felt when one gets a shock from a doorknob or other object usually is between 25 thousand and 30 thousand volts. However, the electric current only flows briefly, so the flow of electrons through the person's body does not cause physical harm. On the other hand, when clouds gain electrical charges they have even higher voltages and the amperage (the number of electrons that will flow in the lightning strike) can be very high. That means that electrons can jump from a cloud to the earth (or from the earth to a cloud). If those electrons go through a person, then the electric shock can burn or kill.\nHistorical experiment.\nThe following experiment is described by James Clerk Maxwell in his work \"A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism\" (1873). Normally, glass and resin are both neutrally charged. However, if they are rubbed together and then separated, they will become able to attract each other.\nIf a second piece of glass is rubbed with a second piece of resin, the following things will be seen:\nIf a charged and an uncharged object are brought together, attraction will be very weak.\nBodies that are able to attract or repel things in this way are said to be 'electrified', or to be 'charged with electricity'. When two different substances are rubbed together, an electrical charge is produced because one of them will give electrons to the other. The reason is that the atoms in the two substances have unequal power to attract electrons. So the one that is more able to attract electrons will take electrons from the one that has a lower attractive force. If glass is rubbed against something else, it may either give or take electrons. What happens depends on what the other thing is.\nThings that have taken electrons are called \"negatively charged\", and things that have given up electrons are called \"positively charged\". There is no special reason for these names. It is just an arbitrary (random choice) convention (agreement).\nBesides being electrified by friction, bodies may be electrified in many other ways."}

Its members are known by the common names of silversword or greensword due to their long, narrow leaves and the silvery hairs on some species.\nThe Silversword plant grows only at high elevations on the Island of Maui in Hawaii.\nThe silversword is a noticeable, round-shaped rosette plant with rigid (swordlike), succulent leaves densely covered by silver hairs. When a plant flowers at the end of its life, it produces a spectacular flowering stalk 0.5-2.0 m (1.6-6.4\u00a0ft) tall, typically with hundreds of maroon sunflowerlike flower heads. This plant receives more attention from visitors to Haleakala National Park than any other plant or animal because of its striking appearance and restricted distribution.\nThe strikingly beautiful Haleakala silversword has always aroused the curiosity of human visitors to Haleakala Volcano. In pre-park days, plants were often removed by travelers to Haleakala Volcano as proof that the party had reached the summit, a practice that eventually seriously affected the silversword population. Browsing by feral goats and domestic cattle was also a significant factor in the silversword decline, but it was not a species preferred by these animals. By the 1920s, silversword numbers were so depleted that the Maui Chamber of Commerce sent a petition to Washington, DC, requesting that a serious effort be made to save the species (Loope and Crivellone 1986)."}

{"id": "9364", "revid": "487619", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9364", "title": "Hip hop", "text": "Hip hop is a type of culture/art style that started in the 1970s in the Bronx. It began in Jamaican American, African American, and Puerto Rican/Hispanic and Latino American urban areas in some of the larger cities of the United States. Hip hop uses drum beats produced by a drum machne, and rapping, where the rapper or group chants or says words with a rhythm that rhymes. The lyrics of hip hop songs are often about the life of urban people in the big cities. Hip hop music also uses musical styles from pop music such as disco and reggae. Rap and hip hop music have become successful music genres.\nHip hop as a culture involves the music as well as a style of dressing called \"urban\" clothes (baggy pants, Timberland leather work boots, and oversize shirts); a dancing style called breakdancing or \"B-boying\"; and graffiti, a street art in which people paint pictures or words on walls. In the 2000s, hip hop music and hip hop culture are very popular in the United States and Canada. Hip hop musicians usually use nicknames. Many of the popular hip hop musicians from the 2000s use nicknames, such as Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Eminem, Lil' Wayne, and 50 Cent. Cities that produce the most hip hop are New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Detroit, Los Angeles, Houston and Memphis. Hip hop is sometimes fused with other genres such as country music and rock music.\nListening to hip hop is associated with alcohol use, problematic alcohol use, illicit drug use, and aggressive behaviors. Hip hop often promotes sex, drugs, crime and violence.\nRapping.\nRapping is a form of singing. It is a mix between singing and talking. The words are spoken with rhythm and in the text there are rhymes. The urban youth made rhyming games based on rap. The beat in the background is a simple loop that is sometimes made by the rapper themself or sometimes copied from a sample CD. The simple loop carries out through the entire song usually, except for the chorus. It developed in the ethnic minority urban (city) areas, as an American form of Jamaican \"toasting\" (chanting and rhyming with a microphone).\nRun DMC and The Sugarhill Gang were early popular hip hop groups in the 1980s. When rappers began to use violent language and gestures, the music was then liked by gangsters. This kind of music was called \"gangsta rap\". Gangsta rap often has lyrics which are about guns, drug dealing and life as a thug on the street. This genre also began in the 1980s and is still produced.\nSome well known early rappers include: Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, The Notorious B.I.G., Eminem, and Sean \"P-Diddy\" Combs. During the 1990s there was a rivalry between the two big record labels \"Death Row Records\" and \"Bad Boy Records\". The rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. were murdered. Later, the two record labels stopped the rivalry. Because most of the rappers who rapped for \"Death Row Records\" were from the West Coast of the US and most of the rappers who rapped for \"Bad Boy Records\" were from the East Coast, this rivalry was called \"the West Coast \u2013 East Coast beef\".\nThe fastest rapper according to Guinness World Records is Twista. In 1992, he rapped 11 syllables in one second. In 2013, the song Rap God by Eminem took the record for most words in a song; 1,560 in a little over 6 minutes, which is about 4 words per second."}
{"id": "9386", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9386", "title": "Color blindness", "text": "People with color blindness cannot tell the difference between certain colors. They may not see colors at all. \nMost color blindness is heritable, usually as simple Mendelian inheritance. Sometimes, it is the result of damage to the eyes, nerves, or the brain. It can be caused by coming into contact with certain chemicals. \nMost color blindness is permanent. Some conditions can lead to temporary color blindness. During certain kinds of migraine, some people are unable to tell the difference between certain colors. There is no treatment cure for permanent color blindness.\nMany more males are color blind than females. Between five and eight percent of males, but less than one percent of females, are color blind.\nColor blindness is usually thought of as a disability. However, people who are color blind have one advantage: they are sometimes better at seeing through some types of camouflage.\nHistory.\nIn 1798, English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific article about color blindness. That was after he found out that he was color blind. The article was called \"Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours\". Because of this, the condition is sometimes called \"daltonism\". As of 2009, the word \"daltonism\" is used only for the type of color blindness called deuteranopia.\nSeeing color.\nThere are three steps in the process of telling the difference between colors:\nHow the human eye sees colors.\nInside the human eye is a part called the retina. The retina receives the images that the eye sees. It sends the images to the brain. The retina has two types of cells: Rod cells and Cone cells. They work in different types of light. \nHow the brain works out the colors.\nParts of the thalamus and the visual cortex in the brain are involved in \"seeing\", also seeing colors. Color blindness can therefore also result if these areas of the brain, the optic nerve or the retina have been damaged. These types of color blindness usually happen because of an accident. They are not inherited. Inherited forms of color blindness affect the retina only. \nThat way it is possible that only a part of the visual field is affected by color blindness, but in the rest, there is no color blindness. \nSome types of color blindness, but not inherited color blindness, can be cured.\nCauses of color blindness.\nThere are several different problems that can cause color blindness. \nDifferent types of color blindness.\nTotal color blindness.\nThis condition is very rare. People who suffer from it can only see in black, gray and white: They can perceive only differences in \"brightness\" and do not see \"color\". This is called \"monochromacy\".\nThere are two main types of total color blindness:\nRed/green color blindness.\nThere are two kinds of red-green color blindness: protanopia or deuteranopia. Deuteranopia is the most common form of color blindness; between five and ten percent of males suffer from it. It is called Daltonism because John Dalton discovered it. Those affected have trouble telling the difference between red and green. As seen by protanopes (people suffering from protanopia), red is darkened. Most often, this is because they lack the receptors for long (protanopia) or medium (deuteranopia)-length light waves or because these receptors have changed their sensitivity.\nBlue/yellow color blindness.\nAlthough the name is blue-yellow color blindness (tritanopia), people affected by this type of color blindness can usually tell the difference between blue and yellow. Instead they cannot tell the difference between blue and green, and also yellow and violet. It is different from the other types of color blindness because it is not linked to sex. It is equally possible for anyone to develop blue-yellow color blindness. It is caused by having few or no cones in the retina which can sense short wavelength light.\nOther causes of color blindness.\nSometimes, people do not have problems seeing color, but their brain has trouble \"telling\" the color, and interprets it wrong. It is also possible that only certain parts of the eye have color blindness; people may become color blind because of other diseases, but after the disease goes away, see normally again. This seems to be the case with certain forms of migraine.\nHow color blindness is inherited.\nMales have one X and one Y chromosome; females have two X chromosomes. Many of the genes involved in making color vision work are on the X chromosome: they are sex linked. For this reason, men are more often affected by color blindness than women. \nThe \"color blind\" gene allows non-color blind people see the difference between red and green. The gene is located on the X chromosome. This means that a male will be color blind if the single X he inherits from his mother contains the color blind version of the \"color blind\" gene. A female will inherit color blindness only if she inherits two X chromosomes containing defective (mutant) color gene alleles. In other words, a female needs to inherit \"color blind\" genes from both parents in order to be color blind.\nTesting someone for color blindness.\nThe Ishihara plate test has been in use since 1917. Each plate has an image with dots of different size and color. People will then \"see\" different images (most often Arabic numbers). Those with certain types of color blindness will see different numbers from those not affected by color blindness. \nBecause many young children have not learned numbers yet, other tests have been developed. They use symbols, like a square, a circle or a car instead of numbers.\nDesign changes.\nA color code is when there is much information in the color of certain item. Such codes cannot be understood easily by those who are color blind. For this reason, color should not be used alone to give information. Good graphic design avoids using color coding or color differences alone to give information. This does not only help color blind people, but also normally sighted people.\nCascading Style Sheets can be used on web pages. They allow to give a different color scheme for color blind people. Certain color scheme generators help graphic designers see color schemes as eight types of color blind people see them. \nColor blindness is very sensitive to changes in material. A red-green color blind person may be unable to see the difference between colors on a map printed on paper. The same map on a computer screen or television may appear normally. In addition, some color blind people find it easier to tell the difference between colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood. Thirdly, for some color blind people, color can only be distinguished if there is enough color: thin lines might appear black, but a thicker line of the same color can be seen in the correct color.\nIn certain cases when it is important to understand information very quickly, the visual system may drop the colors, and only work in shades of gray. This is important to know when designing the interfaces for objects that need to be used in an emergency situation, like emergency brakes, or emergency telephones. \nBecause color blind people may not see the difference between colors such as red and green, some countries, such as Romania have refused to give them driving licenses. In Romania, people have started to change the laws so that color blind people will also be able to drive legally.\nIn the United Kingdom, electricity wires in houses used to be red, black and green. They were changed to brown, blue and green/yellow to help color blind people see the difference between the \"live\" and \"earth\" wires.\nWhat color blindness is not.\nMany people do not understand color blindness. People who are color blind never swap the colors they are blind to. They may have trouble telling two colors from one another. That way they may have a problem finding the right kind of apple in the supermarket. The image below first shows the way that two apples look to a person with normal vision, and then the way it looks to a person with red-green color blindness. The left apple is a \"Braeburn\"; it is red in color. The apple on the right is a \"Granny Smith\"; it is green. To someone with red-green blindness, the apples look like they are almost the same color."}

The people of this city are famous for their loyalty to their country, and their hometown. A famous monument is 'Gate of Faith' which is the symbol of the people's faith to Hungary in 1921.\nHistory.\nAncient Scarbantia.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, there was a city here called Scarbantia. The main square of Sopron is in the same place as the forum (or main square) of Roman times.\nAfter this, the city was probably deserted. When the Hungarians arrived in the area, it was in ruins. In the 9th\u201311th centuries Hungarians strengthened the old Roman city walls and built a castle. The town got its Hungarian name of Sopron from a steward of the castle named Suprun. By 1153 it was an important town.\nIn 1273 King Otakar II of Bohemia took over the castle and took the children of Sopron's noble families as hostage. But the people of the city opened the gates when the army of King Ladislaus IV of Hungary arrived. The King Ladislaus made Sopron a free royal town.\n1500s-1800s.\nIn 1528 Hungary was invaded by Ottoman Turks who destroyed many parts of the city but did not take it over. Many people from other towns fled to Sopron for safety.\nIn 1676 most of the ancient buildings in the city were destroyed by a fire. When they were replaced, they were in a new style, called Baroque. Many of the Baroque buildings are standing today.\n1900s.\nSopron was an important town in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the World War I it became part of Austria. But the townspeople were not happy with this and in December 1921 they voted that the city should be part of Hungary. Since that day the city has been called \"Civitas Fidelissima\", (\"The Most Loyal Town\" which in Hungarian is \"A Legh\u0171s\u00e9gesebb V\u00e1ros\"). A holiday is held every year to celebrate.\nIn World War II Sopron suffered badly. It was bombed several times. There were many Jewish people living in Sopron before the war. The Nazis and their Hungarian allies sent the Jews of Sopron to death camps and killed nearly all of them, as well as other people who disagreed with Nazi ideas.\nThe Soviet Red Army captured the city on April 1, 1945. Sopron, as part of Hungary, was ruled by a Socialist government. At this time many factories were built around Sopron. The Socialist government took away a lot of the freedom that people had. In August 1989, in Sopron there was a big protest against the Socialist government, which was called the \"Pan-European Picnic\". While this was happening more than 200 people who lived in East Germany (which was Socialist) escaped to the West. This was the beginning of a big change for all the Socialist countries of Europe. People who had not been allowed to travel or live in other countries were finally allowed to be free.\n21st century.\nHungary is now part of the European Union. Sopron now has trade with other countries, most importantly Austria. There are many German-speaking people who live in Sopron so most street signs are written in both Hungarian and German.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nThe city of Sopron shows signs of its long history in its buildings. There are still walls and foundations from the Ancient Roman times and also building from the Middle Ages. The medieval Kecske Church (\"Goat Church\") was where coronations (crowning kings) and parliament took place. There is also a very old Jewish synagogue.\nMany old buildings whose architecture are from the 1600s and 1700s and are in the Baroque style which often has a lot of decoration. Storn\u00f3 House is one of the most well-known buildings, because of its elegant Baroque architecture, its connection with King Matthias and its interesting collection. There is also a famous statue of the Holy Trinity from this time. the \"V\u00e1rker\u00fclet\" is part of the city built where the ancient moat was; The inner row of houses follow the line of the castle wall. V\u00e1rker\u00fclet has a famous Maria Statue. The Town Hall built in 1896 and the Ursuline Church is an important building in the Gothic Revival style.\nCountryside.\nSopron is popular as a holiday place because it is set in beautiful countryside where people like to walk in the hills, enjoying the pure air, the forests and mountain springs. There are many hiking paths and look-out towers. Near to Sopron is Lake Fert\u0151.\nThe L\u00f6verek, is a beautiful hilly area south of the city, with forests of spruce, oaks and chestnut trees. The flowers that bloom there include \"Lily of the Valley\" and cyclamens.\nWine.\nSopron is a wine producing region, that is one of the few in Hungary to make both red and white wines. The grapes grown here include K\u00e9kfrankos for red wine and Traminer (Gew\u00fcrztraminer) for white wine. In climate it is similar to the Burgenland wine region nearby in Austria, and several winemakers make wine in both countries.\nSports.\nMFC Sopron is a football team based in Sopron."}

Erfurt Cathedral was later built on the same site.\nThe city is in the centre of Germany. It was on the Via Regia, a medieval trade road network that stretched across Europe. It became an important trading centre in the Middle Ages. Erfurt was a member of the Hanseatic League, an alliance of trade associations and market towns. It was also famous for producing woad. Blue indigo dye is made from the woad plant.\nErfurt is on the Way of St. James pilgrams' path (Spanish: \"Camino de Santigo\"; German: \"Jakobsweg\"). In the Middle Ages a number of monasteries were set up in the city. Martin Luther, the father of the Reformation, lived at St. Augustine's Monastery from 1505 until 1511.

Their grammatical inflection system has been simplified and lost most of the complex case structure of classical Latin. \nThe area that the Romance languages are spoken in Europe is mostly extent of the Western Roman Empire. The Greek language superseded Latin in the Eastern Roman Empire. Latin survived in Romania, whose language, Romanian, is a Romance language. In Moldova it is sometimes called Moldovan.\nDemographics.\nThe Romance language family is one of the biggest in the world, and in total, there are almost a billion first and second language speakers. \nSpanish is the most widely used Romance language, with Portuguese as the second and then French coming in at third.\nSpanish is spoken mainly in Spain and Latin America. Portuguese is mostly used/spoken in Brazil, Portugal and parts of Africa. French is spoken in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, and in some areas of Africa. Romanian is spoken in Romania and Moldova."}

Stars can change very much between when they are first created and when they run out of energy. Because stars can produce light and heat for millions or billions of years, scientists study stellar evolution by studying many different stars in different stages of their life.\nThe stages in a star's life are: nebula, main-sequence star, red giant and either white dwarf followed by black dwarf, neutron star or black hole.\nHow a star is born.\nA star starts its life as a cloud of dust and gas called a nebula. This is pulled together by gravity which causes it to heat up. It also starts to spin and to look like a ball. When it gets hot enough, it starts to release energy through nuclear fusion, changing hydrogen to helium. This makes it shine very brightly and become what astronomers think of as a main-sequence star. It may stay a main-sequence star, looking about the same, for billions of years.\nHow a star enters old age.\nSooner or later, almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium. This causes the nuclear reaction in the middle of the star to stop and the center will start to get smaller due to the star's gravity. The layer of the star just outside the center will begin to change hydrogen to helium, releasing energy. \nThe outer layers of the star will get much, much bigger. The star will make much more light, sometimes as much as ten thousand times as much as it did at first. Since the surface of the star will get bigger, this energy will be spread out over a much larger area. Because of this, the temperature of the surface will go down and the color will change to red or orange. It will become a red giant. It can swallow up any planets that orbit around it.\nHow a star dies.\nLater, the red giant that was left over from a star like ours stops burning. A cloud of gas is given off and a smaller star called a white dwarf is left behind. After a really long time, the white dwarf cools down into a black dwarf.\nBut, when a big red giant explodes, the explosion is a lot larger and is called a supernova. Instead of a white dwarf, it leaves behind a much smaller, much denser ball called a neutron star. A neutron star is created because the force of gravity is so strong that the atoms left behind would not have any electrons orbiting the nucleus of the atoms. A teaspoon of that matter might weigh as much as the entire Earth.\nA much bigger red giant leaves behind a black hole. A black hole is created because gravity is so strong that even the protons and neutrons collapse in on themselves. Even light can no longer escape a black hole. Since there is nothing we know of stronger than the force that holds atomic nuclei (the plural of 'nucleus') together, some physicists think that a black hole collapses all the way down to a mathematical point called a singularity."}
{"id": "9424", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9424", "title": "Genetics", "text": "Genetics is a discipline of biology. It is the science of heredity. This includes the study of genes, and the inheritance of variation and traits of living organisms. In the laboratory, genetics proceeds by mating carefully selected organisms, and analysing their offspring. More informally, genetics is the study of how parents pass some of their characteristics to their children. It is an important part of biology, and gives the basic rules on which evolution acts.\nThe fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been known since prehistoric times, and used to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding. However, the modern science of genetics seeks to understand the process of inheritance. This began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid-nineteenth century. Although he did not know the physical basis for heredity, Mendel observed that organisms inherit traits via discrete units of inheritance, now called genes.\nModern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance. It studies the way genes work.\nDNA.\nLiving things are made of millions of tiny self-contained components called cells. Inside each cell are long and complex molecules called deoxyribonucleic acid, known for short as DNA. Some DNA stores information for making proteins. The bits of DNA which do this are known as genes. People look different from each other mainly because they have different versions of the human set of genes. \nHowever, a large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding DNA. These sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. What it does is code for important non-protein information. Examples are various important RNA molecules, and \"scaffolding\" bits and pieces like centromeres and telomeres. \nEvery cell in the same living thing has the same DNA, but only some of it is used in each cell. For instance, some genes that tell how to make parts of the liver are switched off in the brain. What genes are used can also change over time. For instance, a lot of genes are used by a child early in pregnancy that are not used later.\nA person has two copies of each gene, one from their mother, and one from their father. There can be several types of a single gene, which give different instructions: one version might cause a person to have blue eyes, another might cause them to have brown. These different versions are known as \"alleles\" of the gene.\nSince a living thing has two copies of each gene, it can have two different alleles of it at the same time. Often, one allele will be \"dominant\", meaning that the living thing looks and acts as if it had only that one allele. The unexpressed allele is called \"recessive\". In other cases, you end up with something in between the two possibilities. In that case, the two alleles are called \"co-dominant\".\nMost of the characteristics that you can see in a living thing have more than one gene which influences them. And many genes have multiple effects on the body, because their function will not have the same effect in each tissue. The multiple effects of a single gene is called \"pleiotropism\". The whole set of genes is called the \"genotype\", and the total effect of genes on the body is called the \"phenotype\". These are key terms in genetics.\nHistory of genetics.\nPre-Mendelian ideas.\nWe know that man started breeding domestic animals from early times, probably before the invention of agriculture. We do not know when heredity was first appreciated as a scientific problem. The Greeks, and most obviously Aristotle, studied living things, and proposed ideas about reproduction and heredity.\nImre Festetics, who published work in German in the first part of the 19th century, was totally forgotten until recently. He described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work \"Die genetische Ges\u00e4tze der Natur\", 1819 (The genetic law of nature). His second law is the same as Mendel. In his third law, he developed the basic principles of mutation. None of the histories of genetics published in the 20th century mentions him.\nProbably the most publicized idea before Mendel was that of Charles Darwin, whose idea of \"pangenesis\" had two parts. The first, that persistent hereditary units were passed on from one generation to another, was quite right. The second was his idea that they were replenished by 'gemmules' from the somatic (body) tissues. This was entirely wrong, and plays no part in science today. Darwin was right about one thing: whatever happens in evolution must happen by means of heredity, and so an accurate science of genetics is fundamental to the theory of evolution. This 'mating' between genetics and evolution took many years to organise. It resulted in the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nMendelian genetics.\nThe basic rules of genetics were discovered by Imre Festetics, a landowner (17641847), and a monk named Gregor Mendel around 1865. For thousands of years people had noticed how some traits in parents are passed to their children. However, Mendel's work was different because he designed his experiments very carefully.\nIn his experiments, Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants. He started his crosses with plants that bred true, and counted characters that were either/or in nature (either \"tall\" or \"short\"). He bred large numbers of plants, and expressed his results numerically. He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters.\nMendel explained the results of his experiment using two scientific laws:\nMendel's laws helped explain the results he observed in his pea plants. Later, geneticists discovered that his laws were also true for other living things, even humans. Mendel's findings from his work on the garden pea plants helped to establish the field of genetics. His contributions were not limited to the basic rules that he discovered. Mendel's care towards controlling experiment conditions along with his attention to his numerical results set a standard for future experiments. Over the years, scientists have changed and improved Mendel's ideas. However, the science of genetics would not be possible today without the early work of Gregor Mendel.\nBetween Mendel and modern genetics.\nBetween Mendel's work and 1900 the foundations of cytology, the study of cells, was developed. The facts discovered about the nucleus and cell division were essential for Mendel's work to be properly understood.\nAt this point, discoveries in cytology merged with the rediscovered ideas of Mendel to make a fusion called cytogenetics, (cyto = cell; genetics = heredity) which has continued to the present day.\nRediscovery of Mendel's work.\nDuring the 1890s several biologists began doing experiments on breeding. and soon Mendel's results were duplicated, even before his papers were read. Carl Correns and Hugo de Vries were the main rediscoverers of Mendel's writings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel's priority, although it is probable that de Vries did not understand his own results until after reading Mendel. Though Erich von Tschermak was originally also credited with rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand Mendel's laws. Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism, other biologists built genetics into a science.\nMendel's results were replicated, and genetic linkage soon worked out. William Bateson perhaps did the most in the early days to publicise Mendel's theory. The word \"genetics\", and other terminology, originated with Bateson.\nMendel's experimental results were later the object of some debate. Fisher analysed the results of the F2 (second filial) ratio and found them to be implausibly close to the exact ratio of 3 to 1. It is sometimes suggested that Mendel may have censored his results, and that his seven traits each occur on a separate chromosome pair, an extremely unlikely occurrence if they were chosen at random. In fact, the genes Mendel studied occurred in only four linkage groups, and only one gene pair (out of 21 possible) is close enough to show deviation from independent assortment; this is not a pair that Mendel studied.\nTools of genetics.\nMutations.\nDuring the process of DNA replication, errors sometimes occur. These errors, called mutations, can have an effect on the phenotype of an organism. In turn, that usually has an effect on the organism's fitness, its ability to live and reproduce successfully.\nError rates are usually very low\u20141 error in every 10\u2013100\u00a0million bases\u2014due to the \"proofreading\" ability of DNA polymerases. Error rates are a thousandfold higher in many viruses. Because they rely on DNA and RNA polymerases which lack proofreading ability, they get higher mutation rates.\nProcesses that increase the rate of changes in DNA are called mutagenic. Mutagenic chemicals increase errors in DNA replication, often by interfering with the structure of base-pairing, while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the DNA structure. Chemical damage to DNA occurs naturally as well, and cells use DNA repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks in DNA\u2014nevertheless, the repair sometimes fails to return the DNA to its original sequence.\nIn organisms which use chromosomal crossovers to exchange DNA and recombine genes, errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations. Errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment; this makes some regions in genomes more prone to mutating in this way. These errors create large structural changes in DNA sequence\u2014duplications, inversions or deletions of entire regions, or the accidental exchanging of whole parts between different chromosomes (called translocation).\nPunnett squares.\nDeveloped by Reginald Punnett, Punnett squares are used by biologists to determine the probability of offspring having a particular genotype.\nIf B represents the allele for having black hair and b represents the allele for having white hair, the offspring of two Bb parents would have a 25% probability of having two white hair alleles (bb), 50% of having one of each (Bb), and 25% of having only black hair alleles (BB).\nPedigree chart.\nGeneticists (biologists who study genetics) use pedigree charts to record traits of people in a family. Using these charts, geneticists can study how a trait is inherited from person to person.\nGeneticists can also use pedigree charts to predict how traits will be passed to future children in a family. For instance, genetic counselors are professionals who work with families who might be affected by genetic diseases. As part of their job, they create pedigree charts for the family, which can be used to study how the disease might be inherited.\nTwin studies.\nSince human beings are not bred experimentally, human genetics must be studied by other means. One recent way is by studying the human genome. Another way, older by many years, is to study twins.\nIdentical twins are natural clones. They carry the same genes, they may be used to investigate how much heredity contributes to individual people. Studies with twins have been quite interesting. If we make a list of characteristic traits, we find that they vary in how much they owe to heredity. For example:\nThe way the studies are done is like this. Take a group of identical twins and a group of fraternal twins. Measure them for various traits. Do a statistical analysis (such as analysis of variance). This tells you to what extent the trait is inherited. Those traits which are partly inherited will be significantly more similar in identical twins. Studies like this may be carried further, by comparing identical twins brought up together with identical twins brought up in different circumstances. That gives a handle on how much circumstances can alter the outcomes of genetically identical people.\nThe person who first did twin studies was Francis Galton, Darwin's half-cousin, who was a founder of statistics. His method was to trace twins through their life-history, making many kinds of measurement. Unfortunately, though he knew about mono and dizygotic twins, he did not appreciate the real genetic difference. Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s.\nGenetics of prokaryotes and viruses.\nThe genetics of bacteria, archaea and viruses is a major field of research. Bacteria mostly divide by asexual cell division, but do have a kind of sex by horizontal gene transfer. Bacterial conjugation, transduction and transformation are their methods. In addition, the complete DNA sequence of many bacteria, archaea and viruses is now known.\nAlthough many bacteria were given generic and specific names, like \"Staphylococcus aureus\", the whole idea of a species is rather meaningless for an organism which does not have sexes and crossing-over of chromosomes. Instead, these organisms have strains, and that is how they are identified in the laboratory.\nGenes and development.\nGene expression.\nGene expression is the process by which the heritable information in a gene, the sequence of DNA base pairs, is made into a functional gene product, such as protein or RNA. The basic idea is that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. Proteins make many of the structures and all the enzymes in a cell or organism.\nSeveral steps in the gene expression process may be modulated (tuned). This includes both the transcription and translation stages, and the final folded state of a protein. Gene regulation switches genes on and off, and so controls cell differentiation, and morphogenesis. Gene regulation may also serve as a basis for evolutionary change: control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the development of the organism. The expression of a gene may vary a lot in different tissues. This is called pleiotropism, a widespread phenomenon in genetics.\nAlternative splicing is a modern discovery of great importance. It is a process where \"from a single gene a large number of variant proteins can be assembled\". One particular \"Drosophila\" gene (DSCAM) can be alternatively spliced into 38,000 different mRNA molecules.\nEpigenetics &amp; control of development.\nEpigenetics is the study of changes in gene activity which are \"not\" caused by changes in the DNA sequence. It is the study of gene expression, the way genes bring about their phenotypic effects.\nThese changes in gene activity may stay for the remainder of the cell's life and may also last for many generations of cells, through cell divisions. However, there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism. Instead, non-hereditary factors cause the organism's genes to behave (express themselves) differently.\nHox genes are a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes. The target genes then activate or repress cell processes to direct the final development of the organism.\nExtranuclear inheritance.\nThere are some kinds of heredity which happen outside the cell nucleus. Normal inheritance is from both parents via the chromosomes in the nucleus of a fertilised egg cell. There are some kinds of inheritance other than this.\nOrganelle heredity.\nMitochondria and chloroplasts carry some DNA of their own. Their make-up is decided by genes in the chromosomes and genes in the organelle. Carl Correns discovered an example in 1908. The four o'clock plant, \"Mirabilis jalapa\", has leaves which may be white, green or variegated. Correns discovered the pollen had no influence on this inheritance. The colour is decided by genes in the chloroplasts.\nInfectious heredity.\nThis is caused by a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with a microorganism.\nMaternal effect.\nIn this case nuclear genes in the female gamete are transcribed. The products accumulate in the egg cytoplasm, and have an effect on the early development of the fertilised egg. The coiling of a snail, \"Limnaea peregra\", is determined like this. Right-handed shells are genotypes \"Dd\" or \"dd\", while left-handed shells are \"dd\".\nThe most important example of maternal effect is in \"Drosophila melanogaster\". The protein product maternal-effect genes activate other genes, which in turn activate still more genes. This work won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1995.\nAspects of modern genetics.\nMuch modern research uses a mixture of genetics, cell biology and molecular biology. Topics which have been the subject of Nobel Prizes in either chemistry or physiology include:\nGenetics of human behaviour.\nMany well-known disorders of human behaviour have a genetic component. This means that their inheritance partly causes the behaviour, or makes it more likely the problem would occur. Examples include:\nAlso, normal behaviour is also heavily influenced by heredity:"}

This is important in economics, because the law of supply and demand will decide the price at which something will be bought and sold.\nDemand is the amount of goods that people want to buy at a given price. Prices go up when supply is less, and demand is more.

This is known as the law of demand which assumes that the consumer will want more. Demand forecasting tries to predict how demand will change in the future.\nSometimes the demand does not change much no matter what the price is.

It is written in British English. It was originally only printed on paper, but late in the 20th century it expanded to have digital, or computer versions as well. Since 2010, it is out of print in paper versions. The encyclopaedia is split into many books. The articles in the books are arranged in alphabetical order. There have been versions of it that are for children as well. It is the largest printed encyclopaedia in English, and the second largest encyclopaedia. The largest is Wikipedia. Many people consider it to be the best encyclopaedia, because they think it is accurate and has lots of detail.\nThe encyclopaedia was once very small, the first edition in 1768 only had 3 books. Slowly it became bigger. The last edition, the 15th, started in 1974, has 29 books, plus two indexes. It includes an extra book called Prop\u00e6dia, to classify knowledge. The 29 books and made up of a Macrop\u00e6dia and a Microp\u00e6dia. The Macrop\u00e6dia is a larger one, with more detailed articles that can be as long as 300 pages, made up of 17 books, while the Microp\u00e6dia is the smaller one with many much shorter articles that are usually less than 750 words. The Microp\u00e6dia is used for fast-checking, but for more detailed information, people have to use the Macrop\u00e6dia. Each book is very big, more than 1,000 pages per book. Every year, an update book was published. The last yearbook was for 2018, published in 2017.\nIn March 2012, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online\".\nThe articles in the Britannica are for educated adults, not for children, and written by about 100 full-time editors and over 4,000 expert contributors. The Britannica is the oldest English-language encyclopaedia now. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh, Scotland and grew very popular, with its third edition in 1801 comprising of 21 books.\nThe size of the Britannica is almost the same since the 1930s, with about 40 million words on half a million topics. The encyclopaedia was once owned by British people. In the 20th century it was American-owned, but it is still written in British English. Over time, the encyclopaedia has had difficulties trying to earn money, which almost every encyclopaedia is facing.\nHistory.\nMany different people have owned the Britannica. They include Scottish publisher A &amp; C Black, Horace Everett Hooper, Sears Roebuck and William Benton. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. is owned by Jacqui Safra, a Swiss billionaire and actor. Information technology has become better and more electronic encyclopaedias such as \"Microsoft Encarta\" and Wikipedia have made people not want to buy encyclopaedias in print anymore. So that it still can survive, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. has kept on telling people that the \"Britannica\" is good and accurate, made the encyclopaedia cheaper, and made electronic versions on CD-ROM, DVD and the World Wide Web. Since the early 1930s, the company has also promoted spin-off reference works.\nEditions.\nThere are 15 official editions of the encyclopaedia, with some extensions to the 3rd and 5th editions (see the Table below). Actually, one can say that the 10th edition was only an extension to the 9th edition, and the 12th and 13th editions were extensions to the 11th edition. The 15th edition was reorganised in 1985, and the updated, current version is the 15th edition.\nThrough the encyclopaedia's history, the \"Britannica\" wanted to be an excellent reference book and to provide learning materials for those who want to study. In 1974, the 15th edition had a third wish: to put together all that everyone knows. The history of the \"Britannica\" can be divided into five main eras, or lengths of time.\nFirst era.\nIn its first years (1st\u20136th editions, 1768\u20131826), the \"Britannica\" was controlled by the people who first wrote it, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, and by their friends and relations, such as Thomas Bonar, George Gleig and Archibald Constable. The \"Britannica\" was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh, a city in Scotland, called the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, or, A dictionary of arts and sciences, compiled upon a new plan\". It was written to replace the French \"Encyclop\u00e9die\". Its logo, which is the floral emblem of Scotland, shows that the \"Britannica\" was a Scottish business. The encyclopaedia being created is one of the most famous events that happened in the time when Scotland started inventing many things, or the Age of Enlightenment. The \"Britannica\" started as three-book set ( in the 1st edition) written by one young editor\u2014William Smellie\u2014 Many people said that the first edition of the encyclopaedia was very inaccurate, and had many problems in it. Slowly, the \"Britannica\" changed, in the first era, to a 20-book set written by many people. Although a few other encyclopaedias had been fighting with the \"Britannica\", such as \"Rees's Cyclopaedia\" and Coleridge's \"Encyclopaedia Metropolitana\", these encyclopedias either went bankrupt or were not finished because the people writing them argued. When the first era was almost over, the \"Britannica\" had many people helping to write it, all having different types of skills. The encyclopaedia managed to get so many people by inviting their friends to help.\nSecond era.\nIn the second era (7th\u20139th editions, 1827\u20131901), the \"Britannica\" was owned by the Edinburgh company, A &amp; C Black. Although some of the people who helped write the \"Britannica\" helped because they were friends of the most important editors, many other people wanted to help the \"Britannica\" because it was becoming very successful. These people came from many other countries, and some of them were very famous for the things they wrote about. An index of all the articles was written to add to the 7th edition of the encyclopaedia, and they continued to make an index until 1974. The first English chief editor was Thomas Spencer Baynes, who led the making of the famous 9th edition, which is also called the \"Scholar's Edition\". The 9th edition is considered to be the \"Britannica\" most meant for students ever written. However, at the end of the 19th century, the 9th edition was already too old and the \"Britannica\" had many financial problems.\nThird era.\nIn the third era (10th\u201314th editions, 1901\u20131973), the \"Britannica\" was owned by American people, who started to advertise a lot to earn more money. The American owners also slowly made the \"Britannica's\" articles simpler, so it could serve more people. The 11th edition is said by many people to be the best edition of the encyclopedia. Its owner, Horace Hooper, worked extremely hard to make the 11th edition perfect. When Hooper had financial problems, the \"Britannica\" was managed by Sears Roebuck for about 18 years (1920\u20131923, 1928\u20131943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell, owned the \"Britannica\".\nIn 1936, he started to continuously revise the encyclopaedia often (still done so today), in which every article is checked at least two times every ten years. This was a big difference from before, when the articles were not changed until they wrote a new edition, about every 25 years, with some articles used again without revising them. He also quickly made some educational products which made the encyclopedia even more well known by everyone. In 1943, William Benton managed the \"Britannica\" until his death in 1973. Benton also set up the Benton Foundation, which managed the \"Britannica\" until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the \"Britannica\" celebrated its 200-year anniversary, and in 2014 published the last printed edition.\nThe Encyclopaedia Now.\n2007 print version.\nSince 1985, the \"Britannica\" has had four parts: the \"Microp\u00e6dia,\" the \"Macrop\u00e6dia,\" the \"Prop\u00e6dia,\" and a two-book index. The \"Britannica\"'s articles are found in the \"Microp\u00e6dia\" and \"Macrop\u00e6dia,\" which contain 12 and 17 books, respectively, each book having about one thousand pages. The 2007 \"Macrop\u00e6dia\" has 699 detailed articles, which can be as short as 2 pages and as long as 310 pages, and having references and named writers. The 2007 \"Microp\u00e6dia\" has about 65,000 articles, and about 97% contain less than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors. The \"Microp\u00e6dia\" articles are supposed to be for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more information in the \"Macrop\u00e6dia\". The \"Macrop\u00e6dia\" articles are supposed to be well-written articles on their subjects and articles of information where you cannot find anywhere else. The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and came from putting the articles on the individual states together.\nInformation can be found in the \"Britannica\" by following the notes telling where people can find more information in the \"Microp\u00e6dia\" and \"Macrop\u00e6dia\"; but there are very little of this, with about only one of this every page. So, readers are asked to try to use the indexes or the \"Prop\u00e6dia\", which organises what is in the \"Britannica\" volumes by topic.\nThe use of the \"Prop\u00e6dia\" is its \"Outline of Knowledge,\" which wants to organise all of everything people know. The Outline is thought through by the \"Britannica\"'s editors to decide which articles should be included in the \"Microp\u00e6dia\" and \"Macrop\u00e6dia\". The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, and to tell a student who wants to learn a topic in depth what articles to use. However, libraries say that very few people use it, and reviewers recommend the encyclopedias to not print it anymore. The \"Prop\u00e6dia\" also has diagrams printed on transparent paper of big topics and a section which lists the people working together to make the encyclopaedia.\nAltogether, the \"Microp\u00e6dia\" and \"Macrop\u00e6dia\" have about 40 million words and 24,000 pictures. The index has 2,350 pages, which lists all the 228,274 topics written about in the \"Britannica,\". The \"Britannica\" uses the British spellings and not American spellings. For example, it uses \"colour\" (not \"color\"), \"centre\" (not \"center\"), and \"encyclopaedia\" (not \"encyclopedia\"). However, this rule is not always followed, for example \"defense\" and not \"defence\". The other spellings of the word is sometimes shown with a link, for example \"Color: \"see\" Colour.\"\nSince 1936, the articles of the \"Britannica\" have been revised often, with about 10% of the articles brought to be re-written each year. One Britannica website said in 2007 that 46% of the articles were revised in the past three years; but another Britannica web-site says only 35% of the articles were revised.\nThe way the articles are arranged (in alphabet order) in the \"Microp\u00e6dia\" and \"Macrop\u00e6dia\" is very accurate. Non-English letters are ignored and articles with numbers such as \"War of 1812\" are arranged as if the number had been written out (\"War of Eighteen-twelve\"). If the articles have the same names, articles about persons go first, then by places, then by things. People with the same names are arranged first alphabetically by country and then by their time. Similarly, places that have the same names are arranged by alphabet by the country they are in.\nOther Britannicas.\nPrinted.\nThere are a few smaller versions of the \"Britannica\" encyclopedias. The \"Britannica Concise Encyclop\u00e6dia\", written in one book, has 28,000 shorter articles. \"Compton's by Britannica,\" published in 2007, with the old \"Compton's Encyclopedia,\" in it is written for teenagers who are 10\u201317 years old and has 26 books and 11,000 pages in it. A \"Children's Britannica\" was published by the company in 1960; this was edited by John Armitage and written for His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales; the writers were almost all British. Other books are \"My First Britannica\", written for children who are six to twelve years old, and the \"Britannica Discovery Library\", written for children who are three to six years old (issued in 1974 to 1991). Since 1938, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. has published a \"Book of the Year\" every year, with information about the past year's events, which is written online since the 1994 edition (with the events of 1993). The company also publishes a few books on special topics, such as \"Shakespeare: The Essential Guide to the Life and Works of the Bard\" (Wiley, 2006).\nElectronic.\nThe \"Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2006 DVD\" contains over 55 million words and over 100,000 articles. It includes 73,645 \"Britannica\" articles, with the other articles from the \"Britannica Student Encyclop\u00e6dia,\" the \"Britannica Elementary Encyclop\u00e6dia\" and the \"Britannica Book of the Year\"s (1993\u20132004), plus a few old articles from old editions of the encyclopaedia. The whole DVD also includes other bonus tools including maps, videos, sound clips, animations and web links. It also has study tools and a dictionary and thesaurus from Merriam-Webster.\n\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online\" is a web site with more than 120,000 articles and is updated often. It has features, updates and links to news reports from \"The New York Times\" and the BBC every day. People need to pay to use the website. Special discounts are given to schools, colleges and libraries since these big groups of people are important in Britannica's business. Articles can be read online for free, but only the first few sentences can be seen. Beginning in early 2007, the \"Britannica\" let people read the articles for free if they are linked to another website, since these links let the articles appear more often and easily in search engines.\nOn 20 February 2007, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. said that it was working with mobile phone search company AskMeNow to make an encyclopaedia in phones. Users can send a question by text message, and AskMeNow will search \"Britannica\"'s 28,000-article encyclopaedia to answer the user.\nAn idea to use a wiki-Britannica was announced on the June 3, 2008. A lot of people will be involved, with the Britannica staff editing important parts."}

{"id": "9451", "revid": "765926", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9451", "title": "Ice hockey", "text": " \nIce hockey is a sport that is played by two teams on ice. The players wear ice skates on their feet and can skate across the ice at very high speeds. They hold hockey sticks, which they use to push, shoot or pass a puck around the ice. The players score by shooting the puck into a net; the goaltenders try to stop them. Six players on each team play at once, but a whole team has over 20 players. Each team has 2 defenders, 3 forwards, and a goalie on the ice at a time. When a player breaks a rule, a referee calls a penalty, and the player has to sit in a penalty box for 2-4 minutes. While the player sits in the penalty box, his team has to play without him, and will have fewer players on the ice until the penalty is over.\nIce hockey is very well-known and well-liked in Canada, Russia, Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, the United States, Latvia and Slovakia. Most of the best players in the world play in the National Hockey League (NHL), which has 32 teams in the United States and Canada. These teams are divided 2 conferences and 4 divisions. In the regular season, they play 82 games. Each team faces each other about 3 times. They try to win the Stanley Cup at the end of the year. Another popular hockey league is the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), which has teams in Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Belarus, Slovakia, China and Croatia. In North America, women play in the Canadian Women's Hockey League and the Western Women's Hockey League. In North America and Europe, men's hockey is much more popular than women's hockey. Hockey is played by both men and women at the Olympic games, and at world championships. Ice hockey began in Canada in the 19th century. There are two types of penalty: The major and the minor. The minor is the main one the referee will call during a game and the players have to go in the penalty box for two minutes. The major is when players fight with each other or when someone did something very dangerous. Most of time players are kicked out of the games but in a fight they only get 5 minutes in the penalty box. In the National Hockey League (NHL) there are four referees. Two lineman and two head referee. Only head referees can call the penalty. They can be recognized by the orange armband on their arm. In the major league, the game is separated into three periods of 20 minutes. For the minor league, the time can be different for each category. Each period starts after the face-off. A face-off is when two teams are in position around the face-off circle. Then, the referee drops the puck between the players who play center. There are 6 different positions: center, right wing, left wing, right defense, left defense and goalie. The play is over after a whistle of any referee. After a whistle-blow, the time stops running. Each team can have a maximum of 20 players, including two goaltenders who have a zone to defend. Each team has one captain and two or three assistant captains. The ice is separated into three zones. Each zone is marked by lines. The center zone is between two blue lines and team zones are between one blue line and the end of the ice. The lineman can whistle for two reasons: icing and offside. An icing is when a player throws the puck into the zone before he crosses the red line (center line) and an offside is when a player enters the zone before the one who has the puck enters with it. "}

It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, where it constitutes about 2% by mass, and ninth in the known universe as a whole. This preponderance of magnesium is related to the fact that it is easily built up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Magnesium ion's high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater.\nMagnesium is the 11th most abundant element by mass in the human body. Its ions are essential to all living cells. The ions play a major role in manipulating important biological polyphosphate compounds like ATP, DNA, and RNA. Hundreds of enzymes thus require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium is also the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll, and is thus a common additive to fertilizers. Magnesium ions are sour to the taste, and in low concentrations help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters.\nThe free element (metal) is not found naturally on Earth, as it is highly reactive (though once produced, is coated in a thin layer of oxide (see passivation), which partly masks this reactivity). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light, making it a useful ingredient in flares. The metal is now mainly obtained by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine.\nUses.\nCommercially, the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium-magnesium alloys, sometimes called \"magnalium\" or \"magnelium\". Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium, these alloys are prized for their relative lightness and strength.\nMagnesium is used in fireworks to make a brilliant bright light. Another use is to mix it with other metals to make it strong, lightweight alloys such as those used to make bicycle frames.\nMagnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives, antacids (i.e., milk of magnesia), and in a number of situations where stabilization of abnormal nerve excitation and blood vessel spasm is required (that is, to treat eclampsia).\nMagnesium is used in electronic devices, including: mobile phones, laptop computers, cameras, and other electronic components. Magnesium's low weight, good mechanical and electrical properties are good for these uses.\nMagnesium reacted with an alkyl halide gives a Gringard reagent, which is a very useful tool for preparing alcohols.\nMagnesium is also used in incendiary bombs, which are bombs that blow up and spread fire everywhere."}

The books and poems that he changed into Esperanto from other languages helped to make Esperanto more well-known and used.\nLearning and work.\nGrabowski was born on 11 June 1857 in Nowe Dobre, near Che\u0142mno, in Poland. Soon after his birth, his family moved from Nowe Dobre to Toru\u0144. Grabowski's parents did not have a lot of money, so Grabowski started to work before leaving high school. He wanted to learn a lot, though, so he got himself ready to take a test to get into grammar school. He passed the test.\nHe went to the Nicolaus Copernicus school in Toru\u0144. At that place, he was shown to be smarter than other people that were as old as him. He was put in a higher class twice.\nIn 1879, his family got more money, so Grabowski started to learn philosophy and natural science at the University of Breslau in Wroc\u0142aw.\nAfter he was done with school, he started to work as a chemical engineer. After that job, he started to work as a manager of a factory.\nAt that time, he made many new ideas about chemicals and things that helped with those ideas. He became famous among people in Europe because of that. He also had the job of making new words in the Polish language for technical things. In 1906, he wrote a book, \"S\u0142ownik chemiczny\". The book helped other people to learn the words he had made.\nEsperanto and writing.\nAt his school, Grabowski started to want to know more about language. Because of that, he joined the Slavic Literary Society (Towarzystwo Literacko-S\u0142owianskie), a group that wanted to learn about the Slavic language. Grabowski did not only want to learn about this language. He learned a lot of other languages.\nIn 1887, Grabowski read the book \"Lingvo internacia. Anta\u016dparolo kaj plena lernolibro.\". This book was written by L.L. Zamenhof, a person who wanted to make an easy language that everyone could learn. This language was called \"Esperanto.\" Grabowski liked this language a lot. He learned it, then went to Warsaw to see Zamenhof. They spoke to each other in Esperanto.\nGrabowski thought that books and writing were important to languages. He thought that this was much more true with Esperanto. Esperanto was getting used more, so it needed this. So, in 1888, Grabowski started to rewrite books into Esperanto from other languages. (this is called \"translation\")\nIn the early 1890s, Grabowski thought that Esperanto was being used by fewer people than before. He thought that this was because Esperanto needed to be remade in a different way. In 1894, though, he said that Esperanto was good like it was at first. He said that all the time after that, too.\nGrabowski was the leader of the Warsaw Esperanto Society and the Polish Esperanto society for a long time. In 1908, he became the director of the Grammar Section of the Esperanto Academy. He taught people a lot about Esperanto.\nFrom that year until 1914, he made classes for schools about Esperanto. He wrote something showing that Esperanto was good for learning other languages. People did not know this at that time.\nWorld War I made his family have to leave Poland. They went to Russia, and he was left in Warsaw. While he was there, he rewrote from Polish one of the most important things that have been changed into Esperanto. This was the Polish poem, \"Pan Tadeusz\" by Adam Mickiewicz.\nGrabowski died of a heart attack in Warsaw on 4 July 1921."}

It is an example of the chemical process. Fire is useful, but also very dangerous because it can cause houses, trees and many other things to burn into ashes. Forest fires are very harmful. They can destroy a huge area in a matter of minutes. Every year people die by accident from fire.\nFire can be made in many different ways. Some ways are rubbing sticks together for a long time, using flint and steel, or using matches. However, the Sun does not make fire. Instead, it crushes together hydrogen atoms to release energy through the process of nuclear fusion.\nUses.\nFire can be very useful if it is treated carefully. It has always been very important for people to be able to make fire. People need its heat to keep warm on cold days. It is also used to cook meats. Its light can be useful to be able to see in dark places.\nMost heat engines work by fire.\nDanger.\nFire is very hot. A person should never touch fire, because fire may burn anything that gets too close. If human skin touches fire, the skin may burn, which can take some time to heal and to remove the scar. If a fire gives off a large amount of smoke, a person's mouth should be covered with a wet cloth, since people can faint when they breathe in too much smoke. Even a spark, such as from a cigarette, should be kept away from any fuels that very easily catch and spread fire, like gasoline, or cause an explosion, like gunpowder.\nIf fire is not treated carefully, it can be very dangerous. One wildfire sometimes burns thousands of square miles or kilometers. Forests can burn down if fires are not controlled. Every year, large areas of forests are destroyed because of fire. This usually happens in the Summer.\nControlling.\nIn some camps, there is a camp fire; around the camp fire, there are usually some logs to stop it from spreading. In buildings fire shutters can be used. Fire shutters essentially compartmentalize a fire. With the help of effective shutters, a fire can\u2019t spread from room to room in a building.\nFirefighters are people with special training to control and stop fires. They also rescue victims of fire related incidents.\nFire needs three things to burn: oxygen, fuel, and heat. Fuels can be wood, tinder, coal, oil or any other substance that will easily oxidize. Once a fire is burning, it creates its own heat. This lets the fire keep burning on its own for some time.\nA fire can be stopped in three different ways:\nHowever, some fires cannot be smothered, such as magnesium flames. They can burn in carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and some other elemental compounds. However, they cannot burn in noble gases such as helium.\nReactions.\nFires are usually combustion reactions that take carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The products are very commonly water and carbon dioxide, although there are other examples that avoid this generalization, such as burning magnesium in air, which makes magnesium oxide.\nFires can occur in many ways. There are many types of fire. There are wood fires, gas fires, metal fires, and more.\nWood fires can usually be put out with water because water absorbs heat, but metal fires are too hot for water to absorb enough heat to put out the fire. If water is used to extinguish (\"put out\") a metal fire, the water will simply evaporate. For metal fires, sand can be used to cover the fire and keep it from obtaining oxygen. A fire extinguisher can put out most fires."}

A physician may also do the simplest kinds of surgery.\nTraining and qualifications.\nDoctors are trained in medical schools which are usually part of a university. They hold a degree awarded by a medical school. Doctors work in hospitals, medical clinics, from their own offices, or may even visit people in their homes. They may also work for schools, companies, sports teams, or the military. Medical doctors are often assisted in their work by nurses.\nThe basic degree is awarded on the successful completion of medical school education and practice. It is given different names in different countries. It is M.D. (Doctor of Medicine) in the USA, Scotland and some other countries. In England, different universities use different terms. The University of London qualification is M.B. Ch.B. (that is, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery). Most countries have higher qualifications, based on experience, supervised work, more exams, and theses. Because of its history, in England a general practitioner eventually becomes an MRCP (member of the Royal College of Physicians), but a surgeon works towards becoming an MRCS (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons). A similar system is used in Edinburgh, Ireland and Canada.\nWhat they do.\nMedical doctors treat patients by finding out what is wrong with them, known as a diagnosis. They ask questions about the patient's symptoms. These might include fever or pain. They may ask about past illnesses or family members who have been sick. They will then examine the patient. They look at different parts of the body, listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Sometimes they may need to collect a sample of blood, use an x-ray machine, or use other tools. When they have gathered enough information, a doctor can make a diagnosis and then plan a treatment. Often they prescribe drugs.\nSpecialists.\nSome physicians only work on certain diseases or injuries, or may only work on one part of the human body. These doctors are called specialists. For example, there are doctors who specialize in diseases of the stomach or intestines. Other medical doctors are \"general practitioners\" or \"family practitioners\". This means that they do a little bit of everything. The general practitioner the first doctor a patient will see, and this doctor may decide to send them to a specialist doctor if needed.\nSome types of specialists are:"}
{"id": "9504", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9504", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "text": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American television series. It is about a girl who fought vampires and other monsters. It was written by Joss Whedon. He based it on the script that he wrote for a movie with the same title. The movie came out in 1992 and stars Kristy Swanson, Luke Perry, Donald Sutherland, and Paul Reubens. The television series has many fans. It was originally shown from March 10, 1997 until May 20, 2003.\nThe main idea of the series is the opposite of what is the normal Hollywood idea about horror. In traditional Hollywood horror stories, the young blonde girl is always the weakest character. She is always the one that needs to be saved. She is often the first one to die. In \"Buffy\", Whedon changed that. He changed that girl into the person with all the power. He changed her into the hero. Many of the monsters and storylines on the series are symbols of real-life problems faced by teenagers. As Whedon has said, \"Highschool is a horror movie.\"\n\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" was first shown on March 10, 1997 on the WB network. It was a very important part of the Warner Bros. television network in its early years.\nAfter five seasons, the series left the WB and went to the United Paramount Network (UPN) for its last two seasons. In the United Kingdom, the entire series was shown on Sky One and BBC2. The BBC showed the series at two different times. A family-friendly version with violence and bad language cut out was shown early in the evening and an unedited version was shown later at night. Sky One did something similar. It showed an edited version in the afternoon and the uncut version in prime time. From the fourth season onwards, the BBC showed the series in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen format, but Whedon said that \"Buffy\" was never supposed to be watched this way.\nThe Slayer.\nThe Slayer or Chosen One is a girl who kills vampires. She had superhuman strength and speed. She also heals very fast. It is her destiny to fight evil demons, mainly vampires. When the Slayer dies, a new girl is chosen. That girl gets all of the powers of the Slayer. Potentials (girls who might be chosen - \"potential slayers\") are trained from an early age by a \"Watcher\". In this series, Buffy Summers, Kendra Young, and Faith Lehane were the main slayers.\nPlot.\nThe main character was Buffy Summers. She was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Buffy was an ordinary high school student in the fictional city of Sunnydale, California, except for being a \"vampire slayer.\" Buffy's Watcher was a British man named Giles. With the help of Giles and her friends, Xander and Willow, Buffy fought a different monster every episode. (aside from the main villains of each season).\nBuffy and her friends went to school at Sunnydale High School. They appear normal to their families while killing vampires and monsters at night.\nNot all vampires were evil in the series. One vampire was named Angel. He was given his soul back by a gypsy curse. The curse would make him lose his soul and become evil again if he became really happy. He and Buffy fell in love. The curse took his soul away when they had sexual intercourse for the first time. This caused Angel to become evil (losing his soul). When Angel got back his soul, he knew that he and Buffy could not be together because he might lose it again. Angel left Sunnydale and went to Los Angeles. The television series \"Angel\" tells the story of what happened to him after he left.\nCharacters.\nMajor characters.\nBuffy Summers.\nBuffy Anne Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) is \"the Slayer,\" one in a long line of young women chosen to fight evil. She is blonde and beautiful and she is a normal cheerleading girl at the start of the movie. Being the Slayer gave her increased strength, endurance, agility and healing. She also had greater intuition, and some ability of clairvoyance, usually in the form of dreams that tell the future. She was born January 19, 1981 and grew up in Los Angeles, California. Buffy died two times in the normal series. There have also been magical times that she died in, but these periods of time were stopped and do not affect normal times. The first time she died, she drowned and was brought back to life with CPR. The second time, magic was used to bring her back to life.\nRupert Giles.\nRupert \"Ripper\" Giles (played by Anthony Stewart Head) is Buffy's Watcher. He was an Englishman. He was Buffy's second Watcher. Her first watcher was killed in the movie version of the story but this fact is not talked about in the series. Unlike most slayers, it was not known that Buffy was a potential slayer at an early age. When she was chosen, the Watcher's council sent a watcher to help her. When he died, the Council sent Giles to Sunnydale to become her watcher. In the past, Giles used magic and had a lot of knowledge about demons and vampires.\nWillow Rosenberg.\nWillow Rosenberg (played by Alyson Hannigan) was Buffy's schoolmate and best friend. She was very smart and good with computers. During the series, she learned more and more about magic. She found out that she is very good at magic and became a powerful witch. While in highschool, she had a boyfriend named Oz, who was a guitarist in a local band called Dingoes Ate My Baby, and he was also a werewolf. After Oz left in college, Willow fell in love with another witch, Tara Maclay. When Tara was killed, Willow tried to destroy the world, but Xander stopped her. Later on, at the end of season seven, she developed a relationship with a potential slayer named Kennedy.\nXander Harris.\nAlexander Lavelle \"Xander\" Harris (played by Nicholas Brendon) was another good friend of Buffy. During season 4, Xander becomes romantically involved with an ex-vengeance demon, Anya (Anyanka), whom he later became engaged to, but left during the wedding in the episode \"Hells Bells\". It was said many times during the series that Xander was the person in the group who had no special powers at all, but still fought as much as everyone else, and, in season 7 (\"Potential\") Xander is named the \"Seer\" because he sees everything that is going on, because he's never actually in the spotlight, just next to it. Xander was often the character the writers used for comic moments. Xander was a major character in the series and saved the world (from Willow) at the end of Season 6, by telling her he loved her repeatedly, accessing the human love inside of her \"evil\" persona, created by Tara Maclay's death.\nDawn Summers.\nDawn Summers (played by Michelle Trachtenberg) was a magical energy (The Key) that was turned into a person and Buffy's sister. At first, Dawn had the special ability to open the way to a hell dimension (with her blood). After Buffy's death closed that way, Dawn's only special abilities was being very good with languages and a very fast learner. She could have made a very good Watcher.\nAnya Jenkins.\nAnya Christina Emmanuella Jenkins, or Anyanka, or Aud (played by Emma Caulfield) was an 1100 year old vengeance demon. She was born with the name Aud somewhere in Scandinavia during the 9th century. She became a vengeance demon after casting a magic spell on her lover, Olaf. The spell turned him into a troll. Anya spent the next 1100 years as Anyanka. As a vengeance demon, she would use magic to give a wish to a woman who had been treated wrong by a man. Anyaka lost her powers during a wish she cast for Cordelia Chase. When the wish was ended, Anyanka was trapped in the human body of 17 year old Anya. Anya and Xander got together after graduation and later were engaged. But Xander left her at the wedding, realising he was not ready to get married, but still loved her. She then got her vengeance powers back from D'Hoffryn (head of vengeance) but later lost them again after she realized how unfulfilling maiming human men was (her human side).\nAngel.\nAngel (played by David Boreanaz) was an Irish vampire first named Liam. He was born in 1727, in Galway, Ireland. After being turned into a vampire in 1753, he spent the next 145 year creating terror as \"Angelus\" (face of an angel). In 1898, he killed the daughter of gypsies. As punishment, the Gypsies returned Angelus human soul to him. This caused him to have to feel all the pain he had caused. Angel went to the United States and lived on the streets. He stopped killing people to drink their blood because with a soul he knew it was wrong. He lived a very poor life drinking the blood of rats until a messenger from the Powers That Be took him to California to show him Buffy. He fell in love with her and changed his life so he could help her. Buffy fell in love with Angel but he turned evil after she gave him one true moment of happiness (after they had sex). Then he turned into Angelus and when he was finally changed back (after months, by Willow), Buffy stabbed him in order to once again save the world by closing acaphla (against her feelings of love for him).\nCordelia Chase.\nCordelia \"Cordy\" Chase (played by Charisma Carpenter) went to Sunnydale High with Buffy. She was a cheerleader who only thought of herself. She would help Buffy every now and then, but most often was the one that needed help. During her senior year of high school, all the money Cordelia's parents had was taken away by the government because Cordy's dad had not fully paid his family's taxes. Cordy had to get a job at a dress store to pay for a dress for her senior prom.\nAlthough Cordelia started off as a self-involved character, she grew throughout the first three seasons, learning to love others (spawning a relationship with Xander Harris, above). After Season 3 of \"Buffy\", Cordelia moves away to L.A. to become an actress. After having little luck, she meets Angel and they work together in the detective business- Angel Investigations. Cordelia's character grows even further throughout \"Angel\" as well, and by Season 4/5 of \"Angel\", she seems to be a completely different person.\nSpike.\nSpike, or William the Bloody, (played by James Marsters) was an English vampire. He was born in London around 1853. He was turned into a vampire in 1880 by Drusilla, a pretty vampire created by Angelus. He spent the next 20 years with Angelus, Drusilla and Darla as they killed throughout Europe and Asia. After Angelus got his soul back and left, Spike and Drusilla continued for 100 years before going to Sunnydale to try and find him. Later, Spike fell in love with Buffy. He fought a demon (initially to get his chip removed) and got his soul back and helped save the world in the last episode (\"Chosen\"). He was sent, by the amulet he wore, to Angel. (Stars in the final season of \"Angel\").\nFaith Lehane.\nFaith Lehane (played by Eliza Dushku) was a vampire slayer. Buffy's first death caused Kendra Young to be chosen as the Slayer. When Kendra died, Faith was chosen. Faith is in many ways the opposite of Buffy. While Buffy had family and friends for support, Faith was alone. Faith tried to fight evil, but later chose to be evil instead. In the end, Faith learns from her mistakes and helps Buffy in her fight.\nOz.\nDaniel \"Oz\" Osborne (played by Seth Green) was a musician and werewolf. He was Willow's first boyfriend. For three nights each month, Oz would change shape. If he was not put into a cage or locked up, he would roam Sunnydale from the time the sun set until it came up again in the morning. Being a werewolf gave him increased strength, endurance and healing. As a werewolf, his mind was similar to an animal and not a human.\nRiley Finn.\nRiley Finn was a member of a secret part of American military. \nDuring the day, he was a helper to a professor at Sunnydale University. At night, he lead a military team that hunted and captured demons. He had increased strength and endurance, but he was not as strong as Buffy. He gave Buffy an ultimatum and at the last minute she decided on him. But when she got to his helicopter they had already taken off and he did not see her. When he comes back in a later episode Buffy finds out that he is married.\nTara Maclay\nTara was a member of the Wicca group Willow joined in her first year in college. Willow and Tara started as friends. Over time, they became lovers. When Tara is first introduced, she is very shy. Tara has a very obvious stutter in her first season. Through season five, Tara becomes more confident. Eventually, her family comes back to take Tara home, but she (with Buffy and the gang's help) stands up to them. She became more and more confident until Glory took her sanity. Willow got it back in the season five finale, and Tara was sane again.\nIn season 6, Willow used dark magic (magic that hurt other people) more and more. Eventually, she used it to make Tara forget a fight they had had. Tara broke up with Willow. Tara came back when Willow stopped using dark magic. A very short time later, Tara died after being hit by a bullet meant for Buffy.\nWhedon's Trademarks.\nJoss Whedon uses several themes throughout his works. These are often found in the writing done for \"Buffy\"."}

The first vampire stories were told in Eastern Europe, but much of how modern people see vampires was created by Bram Stoker in the famous novel, \"Dracula\". Few people believe that vampires are real, but they are still very popular in movies, television, and books.\nVampires were once people but have a supernatural curse. Some vampires must drink blood to survive. They do this by biting people or animals on the neck with their two long fangs. People who are killed by having their blood drunk by vampires may also become vampires. Others can live off the life energy of people. In many stories, vampires can change into other animals, usually bats, though also wolves, cats or rats.\nDepending on the story, vampires may have some or all of these characteristics:\nVampires in fiction.\nDracula is the most famous vampire in fiction, and many movies have been made about him, often with Christopher Lee as Dracula himself. Bela Lugosi is another actor known for the role. \"Nosferatu\" is also a famous vampire movie.\nThere is a popular series of books by Anne Rice about vampires. Stephen King also wrote about vampires in the 1970s in \"Salem's Lot\". The television show \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" featured a young girl who fought vampires, but also befriended good ones. The series \"Twilight\" by Stephenie Meyer is also about vampires. The movie \"The Lost Boys\" was about a band of vampires in California. Among many other stories about vampires are \"The Southern Vampire Mysteries\", which led to the television show \"True Blood\".\nProtection.\nIn stories, garlic is often used for keeping vampires away, but it does not actually affect them. Vervain is used to hurt vampires, and in Europe, Though this is not traditional, mirrors have been used to make vampires stay away (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not have a shadow, perhaps as a way of showing that they do not have souls). Not all vampires in stories have this quality (the Greek \"vrykolakas/tympanios\" had both reflections and shadows), was used by Bram Stoker in \"Dracula\". In addition to this, in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", it is mentioned that wolf's-bane (or Aconitum) can be used to repel dracula. The reason for this in the novel it is explained dracula is the Wolfman, and can transform into one just as easily as a bat.\nOther.\nSome neurologists believe that rabies might lie at the base of the myth.\nThe problem with this is that rabid people, especially in advanced stages of the disease, will live for about ten days, at best. This does not account for them getting out of ditches and graves over weeks or months.\nAnother explanation was given by other people. The disease might be porphyria, rather than rabies. Porphyria is a genetic condition that leads to differences when the body makes blood. Some parts of the blood can not be made in sufficient quantities. Writers for the Toronto Garlic Festival say people with porphyria do not like to eat foods that have sulfur in them, and garlic has sulfur in it. \nPsychological disorders can contribute to vampiric behavior. As well as the fact that drinking blood has always been believed to give you the strength of the one you drink from. That belief stems all the way back to ancient civilizations.\nThere are people in the real world who like to dress and behave like a vampire. Some of them may also drink blood.\nFinally, there is the vampire bat."}

It shows they successfully completed their classes, and passed a final examination.\nIt is an official credential. The length of courses, and the number of courses vary depending on which college is attended. In the U.S.A. high schools give out diplomas to graduating students. These are not degrees.\nThere are hundreds of different academic degrees, but they are often grouped into a few categories:\nAll other degrees are known as \"higher degrees\".\nIn medicine, membership of specialist societies are also degrees, and Fellowships are higher degrees. Examples: MRCP = Member of the Royal College of Physicians. These degrees require postgraduate training and practical experience.\nThe college courses needed for a master's degree, or for a doctorate, are often highly advanced, difficult subjects, and they would be extremely difficult to understand unless a person had already attended the undergraduate courses. The reason the upper-level courses are so difficult, so hard to understand, is that they assume the person already knows, perhaps, 1,000 technical terms learned in earlier college courses. This is similar to having to know the Latin names of all 206 bones in the human body, as just part of those technical terms.\nIn many countries these degrees are shown by letters which the person is allowed to put after their name, e.g. John Smith, BA. A bachelor's degree is usually the degree received at the end of a first degree. While the student is studying for a degree he or she is an \"undergraduate\". When he graduates he is a \"graduate\". He may continue with his studies and receive a master's degree or do some original work and write a thesis to get a doctor's degree (which does not mean a Doctor of Medicine).\nA Juris Doctor (JD) is earned by completing law school in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other common law countries. In the United States and elsewhere, those holding a JD must pass an examination in order to practice law.\nSome examples of degrees:"}

In a three-part system such as in the United States, children go to high school after middle school (\"junior high\"). In a two-party system such as in the United Kingdom, the change is from primary school to secondary school at 11 years of age. \nIn the United States, a high school is a school that students go to usually for grades 9 through 12, from the ages of about 14-15 to about 17-18. It is also the last school that the law requires the student to go to. However, students with behavioral issues that are too much for the school to handle are not required to attend. This is called expulsion. Some states have an age or certain grade where a student does not have to attend school, this is called the compulsory age, for example in New York, students below 17 years of age are required to attend school unless the child is excused. Some people may choose to take some tests called GED (General Education Development) as another way to finish high school. A student is allowed by law to stop going to high school after a certain age without having graduated. In most this is 16, however, in a few states, it is 18 or higher, for example, Wisconsin.\nIn the United Kingdom the law requires the student to go to school until 16. The term 'high school' is only used in Scotland.\nThe term 'Secondary School' is used for most of the UK instead of 'high school'.\n'Secondary school' is school year 7-11; which is pupils aged 11-16.\nThere are public high schools and private high schools in the United States and many other countries."}

They are open to all students who live nearby without any charge. They are usually paid for through property taxes that are applied to everyone who owns buildings in the area around the school.\nPublic schools greatly expanded in the United States in the 19th century. Every U.S. state now has free public schools.\nSome people think that public schools have done a bad job of education in the United States. One solution has been to give \"vouchers\" to parents that help them send their children to private schools. Critics say this takes money away that could go to improving public schools.\nUK and Commonwealth.\nIn the United Kingdom, public schools are independent fee-paying schools like Eton College. They are called 'public' because they accept students from anywhere not just people living nearby in the school area. Some are boarding schools, where students can sleep and live at school during the school term. The public schools have an association called the Headmasers' and Headmistresses' Conference. Junior schools which prepare children for entry into public schools are called Preparatory schools ('prep' schools).\nThe term \"public school\", for what are actually privately owned schools, is historical. It dates from the UK Public Schools Act 1868 which set the framework for seven leading English boys' schools, which were:\nTo these should be added other fee-paying schools which have first-class reputations. These would include:\nOthers of note include Fettes College in Edinburgh, which is co-educational. This is very unusual for a public school. By independent\" is meant fee-paying, and therefore not run by the public authorities.\nPublic schools have a very good record of getting their pupils into elite universities, such as Cambridge and Oxford. They educate the sons and daughters of the British upper and upper-middle classes. In particular, the sons of officers and senior administrators of the British Empire were educated in England while their parents were on overseas postings. In 2010, over half of Cabinet Ministers had been educated at public schools. In 2018, annual fees at Eton were up to \u00a348,500 for boarders. Therefore, although some scholarships are available, most students come from wealthy families.\nTwo twenty-first century Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and David Cameron, were educated at public schools, as were a high proportion of those in previous centuries. \nThe leading public schools are challenged only by Manchester Grammar School, which was for many years the leading state-funded grammar school. It is now a fee-paying independent school. It made this change when the Labour government in 1976 chose to abolish the Direct Grant System. This would have given the government powers to change the school in ways with which it did not agree.\nGirls' schools.\nPublic schools for girls have a similar unofficial ranking, though more of them are day schools. The best-known girls public school is Cheltenham Ladies' College. The Girls' Schools Association (GSA) is the body for independent girls' schools. It has over a hundred schools as members. The GSA is a member of the Independent Schools Council.\nFirst, an historical note. Up to and including the 19th century girls from \"good families\" were educated at home by governesses and tutors. This applies very widely across the world, not just in England. The other controversial issue is whether girls should be educated with boys or not. Here the United States is one extreme and Muslim countries the other extreme. Even in England, co-education is almost universal at primary level, but are not common at secondary level except in the state education sector.\nAnother point of difference in England is that girls from wealthy families are more likely to be educated abroad than are boys. Expensive independent schools in French-speaking Switzerland are often chosen. It has not gone unnoticed that, by having such options, the wealthy give their children advantages which the children of ordinary people never get.\nWell-known girls' public schools are:"}

It has a population of 10 million which is about 1/5 of the Korean population and 1/7 of Korea peninsula, and covers an area of 610\u00a0km\u00b2 that is only 0.6% of South Korea. It is the 6th most populated city in the world, and 7th most crowded. Seoul is the center of politics, economy, culture, transportation, and education for South Korea.\nSeoul is in the middle of the Korean Peninsula. Han River (\ud55c\uac15 \"Han-gang\") is a major river in South Korea and the fourth longest river on the Korean peninsula. This river goes across Central Seoul.\nSeoul hosted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Olympic Games. It also hosted the 2007 World Schools Debating Championships.\nHistory.\nSeoul is thought to be the capital of Baekje Kingdom (\ubc31\uc81c) from 18 BC. At that time, the name of the city was Wiryeseong (). Wiryeseong is thought to be Songpa-gu, Seoul. During Silla Period (\uc2e0\ub77c\uc2dc\ub300), Hanju (\ud55c\uc8fc) was name of Seoul. During Goryeo Period (\uace0\ub824\uc2dc\ub300), the name of Seoul was Namgyeong (\ub0a8\uacbd) which means \"the south capital\". There was a palace of Goryeo Dynasty. Hanyang was name of Seoul in late Goryeo Period. After establishment of Joseon Dynasty, the name of Seoul was Hanseong (\ud55c\uc131) and Hanseong became the capital of Joseon Kingdom. From 1910 to 1945 when Korea was under Japanese rule, the name of Seoul was Gyeongseong (\uacbd\uc131). Since South Korea was started in 1948, it has been the capital, except for a short time during the Korean War. Seoul became a special city in 1948. April 19th Revolution (4.19\ud601\uba85) and June Revolution (6\uc6d4 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud56d\uc7c1) was took place in Seoul.\nSports.\nThe most famous soccer team in Seoul is FC Seoul. Their stadium is Sang-am World cup Stadium. It can seat 66,806 people.\nSeoul has three famous baseball teams that all play as part of the Korea Baseball Organization. One is The Doosan Bears and they have many famous players. The LG Twins won the Korean Series in 1990 and 1994. Both of these teams play at Jamsil Stadium. Lastly The Nexen heroes who use Mokdong stadium .\nSeoul has many stadiums such as Olympic stadium, Jamsil Stadium, Sang-am World Cup Stadium, and Mokdong Stadium. Olympic Stadium was built in 1988 for the Olympics. It was used for the opening and closing ceremonies. World Cup stadium was used for several games in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\nLanguage.\nToday, Korean is the official language in Seoul and is spoken in both North and South Korea. Hangul is the alphabet for the written language. Hangul(\ud55c\uae00,Korean) was made by Sejong the Great in 1443. Hangul has 19 consonants and 21 vowels and was said to be a scientific language patterned on the vocal organs. Hangul replaced the Hanja, or Chinese characters, which were used before and are still occasionally used.\nEtymology.\nSeoul has been known in past by the names Wirye-seong (\uc704\ub840\uc131), Hanju (\ud55c\uc8fc), Namgyeong (\ub0a8\uc601), Hanseong (\ud55c\uc131), Hanyang (\ud55c\uc591), Gyeongseong (\uacbd\uc131). It\u2019s current name comes from the Korean word meaning \u201ccapital city.\u201d The name Seoul is thought to come from the Seorabeol (\uc11c\ub77c\ubc8c) which is Gyeongju\u2019s old name. Gyeongju was the kingdom Silla\u2019s capital city. \nEducation.\nThere are many universities in Seoul. Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University, Sungkyunkwan University, Chungang University are in Seoul too. Seoul University is Korea\u2019s first national university. Yonsei University is widely acknowledged as one of the country\u2019s oldest, largest and top-ranked universities in Korea.\nTransportation.\nSeoul\u2019s transportation dates back to the Korean empire, when the first streetcar lines were laid and a railroad between Seoul and Incheon was completed. Today, because of the effectiveness of Seoul\u2019s transportation network it has become a great transportation center for Asia.\nArchitecture.\n63 building.\n63 building is 249m high. It has cinema (63 IMAX), observatory - 60th floor (63 Sky Art), aquarium (63 Seaworld), and lots of amenity. The 63 building has 60 stories high and 3 stories below so it became 63 building. The elevator\u2019s speed is 540m/min. Before Daehan Life Insurance\u2019s building but it\u2019s now Hanwha\u2019s building.\nN Seoul tower (Namsan Tower).\nN Seoul tower is 236.7m high. It has restaurant and observatory. In the first floor, you can see Seoul only. But you can see Incheon in the fifth floor. YTN take over the building and it became YTN Seoul building (N Seoul building for short).\nGyeongbokgung.\nGyeongbokgung is Joseon\u2019s castle. It has Gangnyeongjeon, Geunjeongjeon, Gwanghwamun, Gyeonghoeru, Gyotaejeon, Hyangwonjeong, Jagyeongjeon, Jibokjae, Sajeongjeon, Sujeongjeon, Taewonjeon, Donggung, and Geoncheonggung.\nSungnyemun.\nSungnyemun is Joseon\u2019s south big door. It is national treasure number 1 in Korea. But, it had a fire in 2008. So it was fixed. And on May 4th 2013, it was done."}

In politics, conservatives are against welfare states.\nExamples.\nSchooling can be free, and it can be a duty of state to help ill people. The government may give money to people who do not have as much as most other people. The state may also give homes to people who do not have them. To make this happen there may have to be taxes, and usually rich people have to pay most taxes. The taxes vary, however, to ensure that the less rich people can afford to pay them. For example, in the UK, poorer people have to pay a smaller part of their income as income tax than the rich. There are also taxes put on things that people do not have to pay if they do not do certain things, such as buying as much. This is called VAT (Value Added Tax), which typically deducts 20% so that there is no fixed amount of tax to pay. A Welfare State could also be paid for if the government borrows money from people, mainly by selling bonds. It is run by the government which helps the poor and the needy out.\nWelfare states.\nThe most known welfare states are Nordic countries. The United Kingdom, Canada, and France are some other examples of welfare states."}

Carbon has the ability to form a chemical bond with a wide variety of chemical elements and other carbon atoms. This allows a nearly unlimited number of combinations, called organic compounds. The subject of carbon compounds is called organic chemistry because all known organisms, or living things, are made up of water and carbon compounds. Organic chemistry largely involves the synthesis, or formation, of organic products by chemical reaction using different reactants and reagents, the substances used up during a reaction. Several different areas of chemistry expand on the concepts and principles of organic chemistry, including biochemistry, microbiology, and medicine.\nHistory.\nThe term organic originates from Jons Jacob Berzelius, a 19th century Swedish scientist, who used the term to refer to substances present in living things. During Berzelius\u2019 time, the vital force theory was popular. This theory stated that a \"life force\" was needed to produce the organic compounds found only in living things. The vital force theory began losing support after an 1828 experiment conducted by Friedrich W\u00f6hler. His work showed that urea, an organic compound, could be created from ammonium cyanate, an inorganic compound.\nHydrocarbons.\nThe study of hydrocarbons is a very large part of organic chemistry. Hydrocarbons are molecules containing only the elements carbon and hydrogen in the form of chains. Hydrocarbons can be classified into two categories based on the presence of a benzene ring, a circular type of hydrocarbon. Aliphatic hydrocarbons do not contain a benzene ring and aromatic hydrocarbons do.\nReactions.\nOrganic chemistry reactions happen because electrons are not shared evenly in a chemical bond. Some atoms or molecules, like oxygen, nitrogen, and negatively charged anions, are nucleophilic because they have extra electrons and want to be around positive charges. Others, such as H+ and other positively charged cations, are electrophilic and want to be around negative charges. When an organic molecule has a positive charge, it is called a carbocation. It is also an electrophile. When nucleophiles and electrophiles mix, a reaction can occur. \nCommon reaction mechanisms.\nA reaction mechanism is a series of smaller reactions that form an overall reaction. Two basic mechanism types are substitution and elimination reactions. They are very important in the study of organic chemistry mechanisms because many more complicated mechanisms use them.\nSubstitution Reactions (SN1 &amp; SN2).\nNucleophilic substitution occurs when an atom or group of atoms detaches from an organic molecule and is replaced by another. If the leaving and adding happens at the same time, it is called a SN2 reaction. If the leaving group breaks away from the organic molecule and forms a carbocation before substitution occurs, it is called an SN1 reaction.\nElimination Reactions (E1 &amp; E2).\nElimination occurs when two groups are broken off of an organic molecule by a strong acid and the resulting charges form a double bond. Usually one of the groups is a nucleophile and the other is a hydrogen atom. If both groups are pulled off at the same time, it is called an E2 reaction. If one group is pulled off first and forms a carbocation before the second group is removed, it is called an E1 reaction.\nStereochemistry.\nStereochemistry is the study of molecules in space. It looks into the arrangement of atoms inside of molecules in space relative to one another and how they will interact. Molecules that have the same chemical make up but are arranged differently are called isomers. Famous chemist Louis Pasteur was an early researcher of stereochemistry.\nA central part of the study of sterochemistry is chirality. Put simply, chirality looks at the symmetry in chemical molecules. If an object cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image, then it is a chiral object. If it can, it is called achiral.\nSpectroscopy.\nSpectroscopy is the study of the interactions between light energy and matter. We are able to see colors because of energy absorption by organic and inorganic compounds. When a plant undergoes photosynthesis, it traps energy from the sun, and this is an example of an interaction between energy and organic compounds. \nSpectroscopy is used to identify organic molecules in unknown compounds. There are many types of spectroscopy, but most important to organic chemistry are infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy."}

They are found in the nucleus of an atom along with neutrons. The periodic table groups atoms according to how many protons they have. A single atom of hydrogen (the lightest kind of atom) is made up of an electron moving around a proton. Most of the mass of this atom is in the proton, which is almost 2000 times heavier than the electron. Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of every other kind of atom. In any one element, the number of protons is always the same. An atom's atomic number is equal to the number of protons in that atom. \nProtons are made of quarks. A proton is believed to be made up of 3 quarks, two up quarks and one down quark. One down quark has a charge of -1/3, and two up quarks have a charge of +2/3 each. This adds to a charge of +1. A proton has a very small mass. The mass of the proton is about one atomic mass unit. The mass of the neutron is also about one atomic mass unit. The size of a proton is determined by the vibration of the quarks that are in it, and these quarks effectively form a cloud. This means that a proton is not so much a hard ball as an area that contains quarks."}

It is the first Disneyland. It was opened on July 17, 1955, by Walt Disney, the man who invented Mickey Mouse. It is one of the most popular theme parks in the world. Disneyland Park celebrated it or 66th, anniversary on July 17, 2021.\nIn 2001, the area around the park expanded into a resort with three hotels, a shopping and dining area called Downtown Disney and a second theme park, Disney's California Adventure. The area is now called Disneyland Resort.\nThe park offers its guests many ways of enjoying their visit. For instance, when visiting the park, guests can find \"Hidden Mickeys\" on each ride and all throughout the resort. \"Hidden Mickeys\" are shaped in the form of Mickey Mouse's head and ears, and displayed through various forms; such as a Hidden Mickey shaped cement, on the floor of the Daisy Level in the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure, or three speakers\u2014in the shape of a circle\u2014forming Mickey Mouse's head on the Space Mountain ride, in Tomorrowland. Hidden Mickeys provide guests an exciting way of discovering magic throughout the park.\nHistory.\nWalt Disney worked very hard to run his movie studio. He liked to spend weekends with his two daughters. The family liked going to carnivals and fairs. Mr. Disney wanted to build a place that had all of the fun of the traveling fairs where parents and children could ride together. That is how Mr. Disney got the idea for Disneyland. In 1953, Disney talked to people at Stanford University. He asked them to find a place that would be a good place to build his park. The Stanford people recommended an orange grove for sale in Anaheim, a farming area south of Los Angeles. Mr. Disney's friends thought the idea was a crazy one. He was sure that his dream would be a good one. After selling land that he loved very much in Palm Springs to help pay for the park, the building of Disneyland began in 1954. He also used a weekly television show called \"Disneyland\" to make people want to see his park. In only one year, Disneyland Park was open.\nWhen Disneyland Park opened on July 17, 1955, the opening was shown on television as it happened. Mr. Disney asked three of his Hollywood friends to help him: Art Linkletter, Robert Cummings and Ronald Reagan. Many things went wrong that day. 11,000 people were invited to the private event but nearly 30,000 came. The streets were still fresh and many people had their shoes stuck in it. They stepped out of their shoes. Even the running water was a problem. Mr. Disney had to choose between drinking water and water for flushing toilets. Mr. Disney chose the toilets. Disneyland may have had problems when it opened, but it was not long before it became a success. Visitor number one million came to Disneyland less than two years later.\nSunday, July 17, 2005, was the fiftieth anniversary of the opening day. Many people waited to enter the park that morning. Some people spent the night waiting in Disney's California Adventure. A ceremony was held that morning with very important people speaking to the audience. Art Linkletter, who was part of the first television show, was the first to speak. The day was also Mr. Linkletter's 93rd birthday. Michael Eisner and Bob Iger, the top men at the Disney company each gave speeches. California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger gave a speech as did Walt Disney's daughter, Diane Disney Miller. The ceremony was shown on giant television screens placed in the park and were played over the televisions during the day. At 4:45 that afternoon, the exact time the Walt Disney had given his speech on the opening day, his speech was played over speakers all over Disneyland.\nThe lands of Disneyland Park.\nInside Disneyland are several areas called \"lands.\" Each land has its own theme. This is a list of those lands and some of the things in them. Disneyland is called the \"Happiest place in America.\"\nMain Street, U.S.A..\nMain Street, U.S.A. is the first land people see when they come into Disneyland. It was built to look like a small American town, much like the one Mr. Disney grew up in. A station for the Disneyland Railroad can be found here. It is located at the entrance to Disneyland. Mr. Disney and some of his workers loved trains and wanted a railroad in their new park. Guests can ride steam-powered trains for a ride around the edge of Disneyland. They can also ride a streetcar pulled by a horse, a double-deck bus and even a small fire engine. Many shops and restaurants can be found on Main Street, U.S.A.\nFantasyland.\nFantasyland is like the places in old fairy tales. There is an antique carousel from 1875. The main entry to Fantasyland is through the Sleeping Beauty castle, the symbol of Disneyland. Attractions (Disneyland does not use the term \"rides\") include Snow White's Scary Adventures and It's a Small World. It also includes the Alice in Wonderland attractions. The Alice in Wonderland ride allows riders to take the adventure just like Alice did and visit the \"creatures\" she met in Wonderland. The teacups are another Alice attraction where guests sit in giant teacups and spin as fast or as slow as they want. \nOther attractions include the Matterhorn Bobsleds. It is the only roller coaster in Fantasyland and the world's first steel roller coaster. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride is an attraction that takes riders through the world of Mr. Toad as he drives around in his car. The Casey Jr. Circus Train goes through tunnels and a small stream. Dumbo the Flying Elephant has long been a young children's favorite. \"It's A Small World\" is a classic Disney attraction boat ride taking guests around the world. Each part of the world has dolls that sing the song \"It's a Small World\" in their language. In Peter Pan's Flight, one may fly over London in a pirate ship and explore Neverland. Pinocchio's Daring Journey is another ride that allows riders to explore the story of the Pinocchio Disney movie. Guests can see different small villages of classic Disney stories on Storybook Land Canal Boats.\nAdventureland.\nAdventureland is made to look like a jungle in Africa or Asia. One of Disneyland's first attractions can be ridden here. It is called \"Jungle Cruise\" and takes guests on a boat ride on a jungle river. Tarzan's Treehouse was originally named The Swiss Family Treehouse after an old novel. The Indiana Jones Adventure is a ride in a jeep through \"dangerous\" caverns that include lava, a giant snake, and other perils. The only other attraction in Adventureland as of now is the Enchanted Tiki Room which is the first ride in the world to feature audio-animatronics.\nFrontierland.\nFrontierland is a land that looks like the old American West. The \"Mark Twain,\" a steam-powered boat called a \"paddlewheeler\" takes guests for a ride on the \"Rivers of America.\" Guests can also ride \"Big Thunder Mountain Railroad,\" a roller coaster that looks like a mine train.\nTomorrowland.\nTomorrowland was meant to look like the world of the future. An attraction called \"Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters\" and it opened there in 2005. The \"Space Mountain\" indoor roller coaster, built in 1977, reopened in 2005 after two years of rebuilding. An old attraction called \"Submarine Voyage\" was rebuilt. It re-opened in 2007, as Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage with characters from Disney's \"Finding Nemo\".\nMickey's Toontown.\nMickey's Toontown is where Mickey Mouse and his friends are supposed to live. It is named \"Toontown\" after a place in the movie, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\"\nNew Orleans Square.\nNew Orleans Square looks like a place called the \"French Quarter\" in New Orleans, Louisiana. Two of Disneyland's very popular attractions are in New Orleans Square: \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"The Haunted Mansion\", which have both inspired movies.\nCritter Country.\nCritter Country was first named Bear Country. It looks like America's Deep South of more than 100 years ago. \"Splash Mountain\" is a very popular log ride that guests wait in line for a long time to enjoy. It ends with a very long drop down a waterfall. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh was more recently added to Disneyland.\nStar Wars: Galaxy's Edge.\nStar Wars: Galaxy's Edge is the newest land in Disneyland. It is themed after the \"Star Wars\" franchise. There are two rides, the \"Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run\" and \"\"Star Wars\": Rise of the Resistance.\" The land opened on May 31, 2019.\nClosure because of COVID-19.\nIn 2020, Disneyland closed until further notice. This was because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The park was supposed to reopen on July 17th 2020, but this was postponed. On March 17, 2021, it was announced that the park would reopen on April 30, 2021."}

It was started in 1902 and competes in La Liga (the Spanish top league). The \"Real\" in the club's name is Spanish for \"royal\", because it was blessed by the King of Spain in 1920.\nReal Madrid has won La Liga 34 times and the Copa del Rey (King's Cup) 19 times, the most out of any team in the league. It has also won the UEFA Champions League a record 13 times and the UEFA Cup twice.\nReal Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 11 December 2000, and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004. In June 2017, the team succeeded in becoming the first club to win the Champions League twice in a row. In 2018, Madrid made history by becoming the first club in recent history to win the Champions League three times in a row. They beat Liverpool F.C. 3\u20131 in the final. \nSince it began, Real Madrid has since spent all of its history in La Liga, and has never been relegated down to a lower level. This shows how strong they have been just to stay in the top flight of Spanish football. In the 1940s, the club, the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium and the Ciudad Deportiva were rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War. The club became a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s. In the 1980s, the club had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe (known as \"La Quinta del Buitre\"). They had won two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups.\nThe club has bought and had many famous footballers, including Ronaldo, David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Michael Owen, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kak\u00e1 and other very famous footballers. The most expensive player is Gareth Bale who was bought for 85.3 million pounds from Tottenham Hotspur of the English Premier League.\nThe club's traditional home colours are all white. Its crest has been changed several times in attempts to modernise or re-brand. The current crest is a modified version of the one first adopted in the 1920s. Real's home stadium is the 81,044 capacity Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid, where it has played since 1947. Unlike most European football clubs, Real Madrid's members (\"socios\") have owned and operated the club since it was opened. Real is the world's most valuable club. Real Madrid have won 34 La Liga titles.\nRivalries.\nEl Cl\u00e1sico.\nThere is a strong rivalry between the two strongest teams in La Liga, which are Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, where the game between them is known as \"El Cl\u00e1sico\" (\"The Classic\").\nMadrid Derby.\nThe club's nearest neighboring club is Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and matches between them are known as \"Madrid Derby\". A strong rivalry is shared between fans of both teams."}

In 1967, the government decided to start a large new town with the idea that it would become a city of 250,000 people by the end of the twentieth century. The place where it was built already included three towns and sixteen villages, with about 45,000 people living there. More and more houses, shops and factories are built every year. By 2011, there were are about 275,000 residents. (In the United Kingdom, no matter how large a town is, it can not just call itself a city. Only the King or Queen can give it that name).\nAeroplanes flying over ordinary towns can see roads that look like a spider's web. But when they fly over Milton Keynes, they see that its big roads look like a net or a grid. The people who live there call the spaces between the busy roads grid squares and that is where they live. Nobody lives right next to the big roads, so there are no trucks going past the front door of people who live there. So really, Milton Keynes often seems more like a 100 little villages than a big city. \nPeople do not have to cross a busy road to get from one grid square to the next one, because the roads go over bridges and people can cross safely under them. The paths that go under the roads and between the houses are called Redways because they are red in colour. Only people on bicycles and people walking are allowed to use them. Cars, lorries and motorbikes are not allowed to go on them. So people could cycle all the way across the city and never have to go on a busy road.\nWhat was it like before the builders came?\nBefore the builders came, there were many fields and a lot of villages. People can still see the old villages because the houses look different. There are many rivers and streams and lakes and a canal. There are no houses on the fields beside the rivers. Nobody can build on these fields because sometimes they get flooded when it rains a lot. But nearly all the time, they are just giant long parks called linear parks. \nWhen the builders dug up the ground to build on, they found some strange things. The oldest was the fossil of a dinosaur fish, called an Ichthyosaur. They also found a Roman farm - people can still see bits of it because they decided to leave it alone. They also found some buried treasure (the Milton Keynes Hoard) which is now in the British Museum (with copies in the Milton Keynes Museum).\nWhat is there to do?\nThere is one big theatre and four small ones. There are only two cinemas but each one has ten sections, so there are twenty movies on at a time. There is a ski slope with real snow, even in summer. That is because it is indoors, with a giant fridge to keep it cold. There are four big swimming pools. At the National Bowl, people can see their favourite bands and artists. Not very far away, at Silverstone, they can see Formula 1 motor racing - including Milton Keynes's own F1 team, Red Bull Racing. There is a football stadium, where they can see the local football club, Milton Keynes Dons F.C., play. They can see barges going past on the canal. Near the station, there is a covered skateboard place. There is also Planet Ice where there is leisure skating available and the MK Lightning ice hockey team plays. This is also where they train figure skaters and ice dancers at national competition level. Professional skater, Vicky Ogden who has skated internationally and nationally for Great Britain for over 12 years is the head coach.\nRoad system and roundabouts.\nThe road system in Milton Keynes is based on the idea of major roads between districts and minor roads within them. The major roads (often dual carriageways) run almost all the way across the city but the minor roads are just for local use. Most of the major roads have a national speed limit: 60 MPH for single carriageway and 70MPH for dual carriageway - thus traffic passing through Milton Keynes can cross from one side to the other in a relatively short time. The major roads run either north/south or east/west, though not in straight lines. This network is called a grid: the major roads are called 'grid roads'. Roundabouts are used at the junctions of the grid: traffic lights are rare. \nPublic transport.\nThe original design for Milton Keynes expected bus services to use the grid roads, with passengers walking to the nearest 'edge'. In reality, the bus services use the internal minor roads.\nConcrete Cows.\nThe Concrete Cows are an art installation by the American artist Elizabeth Leyh. The artist was working with local children to use found objects to create art. The concrete and armatures came as left-overs from local building sites. People from outside (notably a BBC Radio One disc jockey) jumped to the conclusion that they symbolised 'concrete cows for concrete fields', failing to recognise how green Milton Keynes is and that real cows and sheep graze the linear parks. \nThe cows in the field to the north of Monks Way near the junction with Erica Road are a copy. The original set is in the shopping centre in Central Milton Keynes. The copy cows are regularly the subject of vandalism - some more creative than others: in 2012 the cows were all painted to appear as skeletons by a local guerrilla artist in readiness for Halloween. This effort was more artistic than most and generally well received with many people voicing a wish (in the local newspaper) that the council not repaint them - but this has been done.\nWhere is it?\nIt is in England. It is about half way between Oxford and Cambridge. It is about half way between London and Birmingham. They can get here on the train because we have five railway stations - the biggest one is Milton Keynes Central. They can come on the M1 motorway - get off at Junction 14. It takes less than an hour to get here in the train from London, maybe half an hour if they take an express train."}

The novel is set in a not-so-distant future society with a culture of extreme youth rebellion and violence. It satirizes trends in youth culture that were around in the 1960s in the West, and to some extent still present today. The dramatic events throw a light on human free will to choose between good or evil, and the weakness of free will as a solution to evil. Alex and his three goons do various crimes, mainly assaulting everyone: Brutally for the men, and sexually for the women. He is sent to prison for murdering a woman whilst burgling her house.\nBurgess experiments with language by writing in a Russian-influenced argot (slang) called \"Nadsat\" which is used by the novel\u2019s teenage anti-hero in his first-person narrative, and the younger characters. According to Burgess, the novel was a \"jeu d'esprit\" written in just three weeks.\nIn 2005, \"A Clockwork Orange\" was included on \"Time\" magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The original manuscript of the book was bought by McMaster University. Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 1971.\nThe best known adaptation of the novel to other forms is the 1971 movie \"A Clockwork Orange\" by Stanley Kubrick, starring Malcolm McDowell as Alex. A 1965 film by Andy Warhol entitled \"Vinyl\" was also an adaptation of Burgess' novel."}

The difference between a hospital and other healthcare places like a clinic or a doctor's office is that a hospital will have beds where patients can stay overnight. These patients are called \"inpatients\". The goal of inpatient treatment is to provide 24-7 medical stabilization, which is why this type of treatment has more of a hospital-like feel since patients are monitored by doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers. Treatment is structured and has a schedule that can include individual therapy, group therapy, case management, and support groups.\nHospitals also treat people who do not stay overnight, called \"outpatients\". Doctors and nurses work at hospitals. Doctors make use of advanced medical technology to heal patients.\nPatients who are staying at the hospital will always be under the care of doctors and nurses who are always available for taking care of the injured or sick patients. Hospitals always have the tools and machines needed for treating the patients.\nThe word hospital originally meant \"a place where people can stay\". There have been hospitals for sick people since ancient times. They were often created and run by religious groups. In the early modern period, hospitals began to be funded by donations from rich people and by governments. Today, hospitals might get money from the government, from charging patients for treatments and check-ups, from patients' health insurance, from people giving to charity or a mixture of those things."}

Romantic love can lead to things such as dating, marriage and sex, but a person can also feel for friends, such as platonic love, or family.\nThere are also chemical reactions within the brain that can be triggered by the different types of love.\nForms of love.\nTheir are many kinds of love. There can be self-love, love towards a friend (such as platonic love), love in romance, towards family, toward God, or towards an object or idea. \nOften love can be confused with other feelings. Being sexually or physically attracted is the feeling of lust. Lust and love may be thought of as different. Normal friendship is a form of love that can be distracted by lust and misunderstanding. \nFirst love.\nPeople describe the person that they first loved romantically as their \"first love.\" For example, in William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", Romeo is Juliet's very first love. At that time, she was only 13. In Maria Edgeworth's book \"Belinda\", Mr. Vincent says, \"First loves are silly things.\"\nChemical basis.\nThe biological model of lust is different from love because it is more like hunger or thirst. Helen Fisher, an expert in the topic of romantic love, divides it into three stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust makes people like each other, attraction encourages people to focus on mating, and attachment helps people tolerate the spouse (or the child).\nLust is the passionate sexual desire that promotes mating. This usually lasts only a few weeks or months. Attraction is more for one person specially. Recent studies in neuroscience say that as people fall in love, the brain releases chemicals, including dopamine. These chemicals make people less hungry and sleepy, and also adds an intense feeling of excitement. Research shows that this stage normally lasts from one and a half to three years.\nSince these lust and attraction stages are both described as temporary, a third stage might describe long-term love. Attachment can be used to describe the bonding period that helps keep husband and wife together for many years. Attachment occurs in the longer term.\nLove and health.\nLove has consequences for health and well-being. Joyful activities such as love activate areas in the brain responsible for emotion, attention,\nmotivation and memory, and it may further lead to reduction of cortisol, which reduces stress. Some people usually do not feel love. They are called alexithymics or aromonatics."}

Prince Michael II was born on February 21, 2002. Jackson never said who the mother was. He is better known as Blanket. When Blanket was 8 months old Jackson held him over a balcony. Blanket has a towel over his head. At the time, people did not know that he was called Blanket. Jackson made a public apology after people were upset. After Jackson died, his mother Katherine was made the guardian of his children. In August 2012, Jackson's cousin TJ was made the children's co-guardian.\nBubbles.\nBubbles (born 1983) is a common chimpanzee, known for being the one-time pet of American recording artist Michael Jackson. Jackson bought the animal from a Texas research facility in the 1980s. The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, to a public perception of Jackson as an eccentric. The chimp, for example, was permitted to use Jackson's personal toilet.\nTheir human-animal bond, as well as the entertainer's other alleged eccentricities, contributed to the media epithet \"Wacko Jacko\", a nickname Jackson would eventually come to despise. The media often focused on Bubbles, rather than on Jackson's music, and published many false stories regarding the animal. One such story was an allegation that Bubbles was not a single ape, but one of several.\nAppearance and health.\nOver the years, his changing facial appearance and lightening skin color attracted much attention. From childhood Jackson had afro hair. His hair caught fire during the filming of a Pepsi commercial in 1983. Jackson got second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson started taking painkillers for the very bad pain caused by the burns. Jackson always wore a wig in his later years. His autopsy found that his scalp was tattooed black so that it blended in with his wigs.\nHe claimed to have had only a little plastic surgery to his face. He said that puberty, weight loss, and his vegetarian diet had changed his face. People said that Jackson bleached his skin to make it lighter. In a television interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993 he said he had a rare skin condition called vitiligo. When Jackson died, the autopsy found that he did have vitiligo. This disease made many white spots on Jackson's skin. Jackson used makeup and medication to even out his skin color to treat his vitiligo. This made Jackson appear to have a lightening skin tone. Jackson also had an immune condition called discoid lupus. Dr. Richard Strick said that this \"had destroyed part of the skin of his nose\". Jackson's nose was the body part that people talked about most.\nJackson was addicted to prescription drugs. In 2009 he died from an overdose of an anesthetic called Propofol. He was given Propofol for his insomnia. The insomnia was a side effect of Jackson's addiction to Demerol. Jackson's doctor Conrad Murray said that Jackson took the overdose himself.\nIn his autopsy, it was found that he had an and osteoarthritis. His lips were tattooed pink. He used a skin-bleaching cream called Benoquin to treat his Vitiligo.\nJackson was physically abused by his father when he was a child. He would also call Jackson \"big-nose\". As a teenager Jackson had acne. In \"Living With Michael Jackson,\" Jackson told Martin Bashir how he went home and cried after a woman called him ugly because of his acne. Some medical professionals have said that they think Jackson had body dysmorphic disorder. The disorder is often triggered by appearance-related bullying. Some people think that Jackson had anorexia nervosa. In 1984, Jackson weighed 105\u00a0pounds. He was 5\"9 tall. This would have made his BMI 15.5, which is very underweight. He weighed 136\u00a0lbs. when he died. This is in the healthy range.\nA biographer called Ian Halperin wrote that Jackson had a rare genetic disease called Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. By the time of his death, it had damaged his lungs so he could not sing. He also wrote that Jackson's genetic disease had caused him to lose 95% of the vision in his left eye.\nJackson's doctor Conrad Murray said that he thought Jackson was \"legally blind\" and had phlebitis.\nDeath.\nJackson was announced dead at age 50 on June 25, 2009 at 2:25 pm at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. It is thought that he went into cardiac arrest, which means his heart stopped. At 4:36\u00a0pm local time, the Los Angeles coroner confirmed Jackson's death. However, he was unresponsive by 12:15, even though he was not proclaimed dead at the time of hospital arrival, he already passed on by 1pm. Jackson died just two months before his 51st birthday. Rumors and news of Jackson's death broke web records causing a cyberspace traffic jam. The circumstances of his death and the outpouring of grief which was experienced around the world were on record scales never seen before. His death gave Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Yahoo the most page views they had ever encountered. Jackson arrived at the hospital not showing any signs of life.\nMemorial service.\nA memorial service was held at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on July 7, 2009.

Jermaine Jackson, Jackson's older brother, then performed Smile, Michael's favorite song written by comic drama legend Charlie Chaplin. This was proceeded by speeches by Martin Luther King III and Bernice King. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was the next person who spoke at the memorial service, claiming \"people are innocent until proven guilty,\" (reminding those who accused Jackson of unproven child molestations) saying that Jackson's humanitarian efforts need to be praised. Usher then sang \"Gone Too Soon,\" followed by a montage of old videos of Jackson himself. Shamim sang next, with Kenny Ortega introducing him afterwards. Kenny Ortega explained that Michael Jackson saw the Staples Center as his home, a reason for the funeral service to be held there. This was followed by Kenny Ortega doing a tribute to him, including \"We Are the World\" and \"Heal the World\". The service ended with speeches by members of his family, including Jermaine, Marlon and daughter Paris who broke into tears and said that \"Daddy was the best father anyone could have\" and also that \"I will miss him\" then she left the microphone and turned into Janet Jackson's arms. The memorial lasted over 2\u00a0hours.\nBurial.\nAt first, Michael Jackson's custom made quarter million dollar golden casket, nicknamed \"The Promethean\" was not expected to appear at the memorial service, however, due to a change in the family's plans the casket was taken to the memorial service.\nViewing parties were held all over the world for the broadcast, including at several movie theaters, in Times Square, the Apollo Theater, Raleigh, and Berlin.

{"id": "9594", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9594", "title": "History of graphic design", "text": "Graphics (from Greek ) are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, computer screen, paper, or stone. It includes everything that relates to creation of signs, charts, logos, graphs, drawings, symbols, geometric designs and so on.\nGraphic design is the art or profession of combining text and pictures in art, advertisements, publications, or websites. The aim of graphics is to brand, inform, and have a specific effect on its audience.\nHistory of graphics.\nHundreds of graphic designs of animals were made by primitive people in Chauvet cave, in the south of France, about 30,000\u00a0BC. Also, similar art was done in the Lascaux cave, France, about 14,000\u00a0BC. The art of primitive hunters is found in the rocks of Bhimbetka in India, drawn earlier than 7000\u00a0BC. Aboriginal rock art in Kakadu National Park of Australia, show that graphics has a long history in many parts of the world. This history (with writing, which emerged in 3000\u20134000\u00a0BC) are the foundation of graphic art.\nCalligraphy &amp; graphics in books.\nReligious books have used graphics extensively. Among these books are Bibles that were created in the monasteries in Ireland, Scotland, and England. Spiralling and interlocking patterns, often including small figures, were part of the ancient graphic tradition of the British Isles. From the 6th century onwards these were applied to the decoration of illuminated gospels.\nGraphics in the Quran.\nIn Islamic countries the graphic designs can be found in their holy book, the Quran. The Quran was first wriiten an angled style called Kufi. This appeared in the 8th century, and reached its peak in the 10th century. Later on decoration of margin, page and other graphic techniques were added to beautify the book. In the 12th century the Naskh script was invented: it used curves instead of angled lines. Other styles were added later on.\nDecorative graphic design in pottery.\nFrom ancient times graphic design has been used for decoration of pottery and ceramics.\nBirth of modern graphic design.\nWilliam Morris had an influence on modern graphics. In the second half of 19th century his Kelmscott Press produced many graphic designs, and created a collector market for this kind of art. In Oxford he was associated with artists like Burne-Jones, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. They formed the Pre-Raphaelites group, whose ideas influenced modern graphic design considerably.\nMondrian's minimalism revolution.\nThe Dutch painter Piet Mondrian in the years 1920\u201321 courageously introduced the style of minimalism in painting. His simple geometric compositions, together with the use of only three basic colors, blue, yellow, and red, in combination with black and white created\na new venue for the graphic designers. He demonstrated that with simple relocation of these colors, and experimenting with the proportionality of various square surfaces, one can achieve extremely different ambiances and various feelings. For the graphic designers who intend to convey a message with a minimum interference from the extraneous elements his experiment in minimalism was a valuable gift.\nCommunication with pictures.\nLogos and trademarks.\nA trademark, identified by the symbols \u2122 and \u00ae, or mark is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, company or other entity to identify its products or services and to distinguish them from those of other producers. A trademark is a type of intellectual property, and typically a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements.\nInformation signs: Isotype and the Viennese method.\nIn 1921, Otto Neurath, an Austrian social scientist, introduced graphic design to help the understanding of social and economical data. In 1925, the Museum of Economy and Society used such graphics for the public. This style of presentation at the time was called the Viennese method, but now it is known as Isotype charts.\nPlacards and posters.\nPlacards and posters existed from ancient times. The Greek \"axons\" and the Roman \"Albums\", with their decorative designs and announcements, were quite similar to today's posters. In ancient Greece the names of athletes and games schedules were written on columns that were slowly turning on an axis. Romans used whitewashed walls in their markets in which sellers, money lenders, and slave traders wrote their announcements and advertised for their products, and to attract the attention of customers they added an attractive design.\nWith the invention of printing, in 1440, and particularly the development of the lithographic process, invented by a Czech named Alois Senefelder in 1798 in Austria, creation of posters became feasible. Although handmade posters existed before, they were mainly used for government announcements. William Caxton, who in 1477 started a printing company in England, produced the first printed poster.\nIn 1870, the advertising poster emerged.\nPosters after World War II.\nAfter the Second World War, with the emergence of new color printing technology and particularly appearance of computers, the art of posters underwent a new revolutionary phase. People can create color posters on their laptop computers and create color prints at a very low cost. Unfortunately, the high cost of sophisticated printing processes can only be afforded mostly by government entities and large corporations. With the emergence of the internet, the role of posters in conveying information has greatly diminished. However, some artists still use chromolithography in order to create works of art in the form of print. In this regard the difference between painting and print has been narrowed considerably.\nGraphic design in modern life.\nToday graphic design has penetrated into all aspects of modern life. In particular modern architecture has been influenced by graphics."}
{"id": "9595", "revid": "160759", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9595", "title": "Pornography", "text": "Pornography (or porn) is the name for writing, pictures, and films which feature sex for the sole or primary purpose of arousing people sexually, either to help them masturbate, or to prepare them for sex with a partner. \nWhen the purpose of these works is not arousal, but for example education, or art, these works are not called pornographic. People instead speak about \"erotica.\" \nIn the law of most countries, showing naked people is not called \"pornography\" unless the people are doing something sexual; even so, material that counts as pornographic may still be legal. When people consider photographs or movies to harm or to disrespect the people depicted or the viewers, or to violate the community's moral or religious standards, they condemn the material as \"obscene.\" Most countries have laws against obscenity. One type of pornography against the law in most countries is child pornography. \nPornography can made in different media. Some ways include photos, drawings, paintings, animations, and movies. Live shows (like sex shows or striptease) are usually not considered pornography. Pornography is made to entertain adults. Many people are involved in the industry of making, selling or showing pornography. People shown in pornographic movies are called pornographic actors (or actresses), and when they attain the popularity to appear in any films, they are called \"porn stars.\"\nDefinition.\nThe word \"pornography\" comes from the Greek words meaning \"prostitute\" and \"writing\". The word was first used for stories about sex, but is now also used for photographs, paintings, illustrations, cartoons, and movies that depict sex to arouse people to sexual activity. It is also called \"porn\" or \"porno\" for short. \nWhat is \"not\" pornography.\nThere are different ideas about what is and what is not pornography. Diana Russell, a psychologist, says that there is a difference between pornography and erotica. The word \"erotica\" is often used for pictures, movies or stories that focus on the beauty of sexuality. There is not often a clear difference between \"erotica\" and \"pornography.\" The dispute over what is or is not pornography can even go to the courts.\nSome people believe that anything that shows a naked body is a type of pornography. The laws of the United States and many other countries do not support this. There can be all sorts of reasons for showing a naked or partly undressed body. Some of these reasons include art work or a medical diagram.\nTypes of pornography.\nThere are different kinds of pornography. The term \"soft porn\" is sometimes used for pictures that show people who may or may not be naked, but who are posed in a sexy manner. Pictures of women like this are sometimes called \"cheesecake,\" and pictures of men are called \"beefcake.\" Pornographic pictures or movies which show people having sex are sometimes called \"hard porn.\"\nThe business of pornography.\nBusinesses have been making pornography for many years. Until the 1970s, businesses making pornography were small because there were many laws against it. In the 1970s, pornographic magazines such as \"Penthouse\" became a huge and successful business. Pornographic movies also become popular at this time. In the 1980s, the creation of the video cassette recorder caused a rise in the pornography business. A number of companies began making pornographic videotapes in the United States. In the 1990s, as more people began using the Internet, businesses began selling pornographic pictures on the Internet. In the 2000s, the increased speed of computers allowed pornography companies to sell porn videos over the Internet. The pornography brand Mitchell Gaffney was the first website that contained such items. \nMany different kinds of businesses make and sell pornography: magazines such as Playboy and Hustler, movie companies such as Vivid Video, and web sites, such as Pornhub, that make and sell porn. Since \"pornography\" is a word that many people consider to be the name for something that is morally wrong or ugly, businesses do not say that they are in \"the business of pornography,\" but rather in the \"adult entertainment\" business.\nPornography and the law.\nIn the nations of Western Europe and the United States, the law permits people who have reached the legal age of adulthood (the age of majority) to own, buy, sell, make, or participate in pornography. Laws about the public display of pornographic materials for sale may vary in the West: in The Netherlands the very liberal laws allow stores that sell pornography to display books, magazines, photographs, and the covers of videos openly, but in Canada and the United States the laws require that such stores keep pornographic material out of the sight of children. In many nations of Asia, however, like Indonesia, Iran, and Pakistan, making or owning pornography is a crime.\nIn the law of most countries, those people who have not reached the age of majority, or minors, may not buy, let alone sell, pornography of any sort. More importantly, there are laws against showing minors naked in photographs or films meant to arouse others sexually, or showing them engaged in sexual acts. Such material is called \"child pornography,\" and is considered not just illegal, but a very serious crime. Because the laws against child pornography (also called \"child porn\") are meant to protect children against people who \"use\" or \"exploit\" them, the laws also require those who make pornographic photos or films to keep records to prove that their models, actors, and actresses are over the age of legal majority.\nCriticism of pornography.\nSince the 1970s, many women's groups and feminist writers have criticized pornography, especially hardcore pornography, arguing that such pornography degrades and humiliates women. Some psychologists who have talked with many people in jail for violent sex crimes believe that pornographic depictions of violent sex often make people less caring about other people's feelings, which might make them more likely to commit rape and other sex crimes. Many pedophiles, who sexually assault children, also have collections of child pornography. \nReligious people believe that, because it depicts the sexual act without any relation to love and marriage, pornography is unholy. Most parents do not wish their children to see pornography because they believe that it will make them less capable of romantic love. Special computer programs can be installed on computers to block access to pornographic websites, or websites otherwise objectionable. \nIn the novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" by George Orwell, pornography is described as a tool that is secretly pushed by some evil governments, who believe that use of pornography makes the public less likely to care about injustice, let alone to rebel.\nOther problems with pornography.\nEven though many countries have laws against child pornography, enforcement has become a problem because new computer technologies allow pornographers to make an adult in a photograph look like an adolescent, or in making a film can use actors and actresses who, although they have passed the age of majority, still look much younger. In addition, organized crime makes money from trafficking human beings; they force girls and women into prostitution, and sometimes force them to make pornography."}

The word \"nudity\" can also be used when only part of a person's body is uncovered. It is used particularly if the person's genitals (or a woman's nipples) can be seen, even if other parts of the body are covered.\nNudity can also mean that a person is wearing less clothing that other people would expect. This type of nudity is related to culture. People of different cultures wear different amounts of clothing, and keep different parts of the body covered. For some people nudity is a lifestyle, belief system or a default state of being, which is called naturism or nudism.\nThe word \"nude\" is often used in art. A \"nude figure\" is a figure without clothes on. The nude figure might be a live person who is posing for an artist. A painting or sculpture that shows a nude figure is often just called a \"nude\".\nNudism.\nThere are several things that affect how people and societies feel about nudity:\nModesty.\nIn most cultures it is normal to keep parts of the body covered. The feeling that a person has about covering their body is called modesty. Modesty is different in different cultures. Often, people feel shame if their body is not covered to match their culture's idea of modesty.\nThe amount of clothing needed to take away the feeling of shame is different for each culture. With some indigenous peoples like the Yanomami, a piece of string is enough to make that feeling go away.\nIn some cultures, people nearly always keep their bodies covered. In these cultures, nudity is only normal when a person is alone, for example, dressing or bathing. In other cultures, it is quite normal for people to be naked together, for example, when dressing or swimming. In still other cultures, particularly indigenous ones, people wear very few clothes, and complete nudity is normal.\nEven with people from the same culture, different people can have different feelings about nudity. Some people in Western culture (for example the United States) do not mind if a family member sees them naked in the bath. Other people from the same culture would be uncomfortable if anyone saw them naked in the bath. Some women in a Western culture are happy to wear a bikini. Other women feel naked in a bikini and always wear a one-piece swimsuit. Nudity is more acceptable in European countries.\nRules.\nMany societies have rules or laws about nudity, and where they allow it. For example, in some societies, the law allows nudity on a beach, but does not allow nudity in a public street. The same sort of laws can also allow people to be partly naked in some places but not in others, for example, women might be allowed to have naked breasts on the beach, but not in a shopping centre. When a woman uncovers her breasts on the beach, this is called toplessness (because her swimsuit is \"topless\"). This is allowed in many parts of Europe and Australia. In many other countries, it is not allowed.\nThe rules about dress and nudity may be set by a government, or by a church or some other organisation. For example, in some Christian churches, a woman must cover her shoulders and a man must not have bare legs. Another example is in many schools, a man must wear a jacket over his shirt, and a woman must wear a dress that has sleeves. Another example is that some hotels that are near beaches will not serve customers who are dressed only in swimsuits.\nSome countries have very strict laws about whether a person can be nude in public, like Spain, and what parts of the body can be shown. In many countries, if a person breaks these laws, they can be charged with indecency (which means that they have acted in a rude way that upsets people). For example, if a man took his trousers off near a school, so that the children would see him, he would be charged with indecency. The reason why a person is nude, affects whether the law says that their nudity is indecent.\nFunctional nudity.\n\"Functional nudity\" is when a person is nude for a reason. Even where nudity is generally not allowed, functional nudity often is.\nAn example of this is when a person at the beach changes from a wet swimsuit to their dry clothes. Often the person who is changing can use a towel so that other people do not see their nudity, and do not become embarrassed or angry.\nAnother type of functional nudity happens when a woman is breastfeeding in public. A woman who would not usually show her breasts because of modesty, might be quite happy to show her breast while she is feeding her baby.\nA very similar thing is called contextual nudity. That means nudity is considered normal in a particular situation or place. For example, people sometimes are nude so their doctor can check if they are healthy or not.\nSex segregation.\nIn some countries, \"functional nudity\" is usual for people of different genders in some places. An example is in a mixed-gender public sauna.\nIn many cultures, \"functional nudity\" is usual in front of people of the same sex. Places where functional nudity happens, such as public toilets or changing rooms are usually separated by gender. There is one for men, and another one for women. In many cultures it is usual for people of the same sex to undress or take a shower in a public change room. In some cultures, such as Japan, open showers and open urinals in men's toilets are not allowed.\nWestern culture.\nAmong people of Western culture around the world, there are several influences on the way societies feel about nudity. In European society, it is not usual for older children or adults to be completely nude in public. In most European societies, when people swim in public, they cover their genitals, and women also cover their breasts. In most European societies, change rooms and toilets are separated for men and women.\nCountries in Southern Europe, where the Catholic Church is very important, as well as English-speaking countries which have been affected by Puritanism usually have a lower tolerance towards nudity in public. Countries in Central Europe, and Scandinavia care less about public nudity.\nNaturism.\n\"Naturism\" (or \"nudism\") is a cultural and political movement. Followers of this movement think that nudity should get a higher value, both in the private as well as the public context. It is also a lifestyle based on personal, family and/or social nudity.\nNaturists reject current standards of modesty. These standards discourage people from being nude with others, they say. They want to create a social environment where people feel comfortable in the company of nude people. They want a society in which people do not fear being seen nude, even by the general public.\nScandal.\nThe singer Janet Jackson was the cause of a scandal during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004. While she was performing, her robe moved. Her left breast could be seen for a few seconds. Today, this is known as the \"Wardrobe Malfunction\" or \"Nipplegate\" by the media, the latter being a comparison to the Watergate scandal.\nThe Royal Academy of Arts runs some museums in London, and elsewhere. In 2008, they did an advertisement so that more people would visit their museums. In this advertisement, they showed a picture of a naked woman. This painting was done by Lucas Cranach the Elder in the 15th century. It is called \"Venus\" (shown above). The picture was printed on ads in the London Underground. It caused protests in London. Because of the protests, Transport for London refused to allow the ads to be used in the Underground. On December 7, 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation put the Wikipedia article on Virgin Killer, on their blacklist. This meant that most Internet users in Great Britain could no longer access the article. The foundation did this because they believed the original album cover could be child pornography. The cover is pictured on the Wikipedia article. It shows a naked ten-year-old girl in a sexual pose, with her breasts shown.\nAfrica.\nThere are different traditions about nudity in Africa. Some of Africa south of the Sahara (called \"sub-Saharan Africa\") is similar to how they were after colonialism. In certain Togolese tribal areas, it is common for big families to not wear any clothes at all for certain festivities. Others do not wear any clothes below the waist. This makes it possible for young men to see women and girls whom they may marry. Stick-fighting tournaments are very popular places to do this.\nOther people, like the Bantu do not like public nudity at all. A newspaper in Botswana once printed a photograph showing how a thief was punished. He was flogged on his bare buttocks. Many people did not like this. The problem was not the flogging, but the newspaper showing the picture.\nThe Ugandan Kavirondo tribes are a mix of Bantu and Nilotic immigrants. Traditionally, they went mostly naked. Over time, the men began wearing clothing similar to men in western culture.\nMuslim culture.\nAmong many Muslim people, a woman is thought to be not properly dressed unless her legs, arms and hair are completely covered. In some Arabic countries, women wear a garment called a burqa. The burqa fully covers the woman and has only a slit for her eyes to see. If a woman does not wear this garment when she goes out but shows her face, hair and arms, she is thought to be naked. Not wearing the burqa brings shame on herself and family.\nNudity in art.\nLevels of nudity.\nThere are different levels of nudity. Societies have different moral values for these levels. One such level in English is called \"full frontal nudity\". This usually is a pose where the nude person faces the viewer. In this pose, there are no things covering parts of the body. Many societies see this as very bad. The image below called \"Truth\" shows this pose.\nMost movies try not to show this type of nudity. This is often done by putting an object somewhere. This object will hide the pubic area of the naked actor or actress. This kind of nudity can also be seen in the picture \"Woman Bathing\".\nSince the very early ages, nudity has been a subject of the arts. One of the earliest works of art known is the Venus of Willendorf. It is a statuette (a small statue) of a nude woman. The face of the woman is not visible. The belly of the woman as well as her breasts are exaggerated. It is not known what the statuette meant to the people who made it, or what importance it had. From the Renaissance onward, nude figures were shown in works of art more often. Michelangelo is one of the Renaissance artists known for doing this.\nNudity in photography.\nSince the beginning of photography, people have taken photographs of nude people. Some people simply photographed nude people. Some of the photographs were made to sexually arouse people. These are generally called pornography. Some people also photographed nude people because they thought the human body was something beautiful to show. These photos are usually not sexual in nature, and are known as nude photography. The kind of photography that is in between is called erotic photography.\nNudity in different times.\nAncient Egypt.\nFashion was relatively constant in Ancient Egypt, and did not change much. In general, Egyptians did not wear much clothing. Men were often topless and bare-footed. They usually wore a tunic around the waist. Women wore loose clothes. People who were showing spectacles, usually did not wear any clothes. This applied to both men and women. In general, children did not wear any clothes, until they reached puberty, that is, until they were about twelve years old. Later cultures did not like these clothing rules.\nEuropeans also did not like these clothing rules. When Meyers Konversationslexikon (an encyclopedia) was published in the 1880s, the depiction of murals in the Tomb of Ti was changed to the image that can be seen on the right. Other publications were also changed in the same way.\nOld Testament and Judaism.\nThe creation story in the Old Testament of the Bible mentions nudity as a sign of innocence. Only after Adam and Eve have eaten from the tree of knowledge do they become aware of their nudity, and start to feel ashamed. Theologians see this feeling of shame as a consequence of the fall from grace. Because of this, they are later chased away from the Garden of Eden. The Bible does not make a distinction between shame as a consequence of not obeying a rule, and the shame resulting from nudity.\nThe Old Testament often sees nudity as a consequence of being poor or of being a social outcast. It is not seen as a result of breaking rules, and accepted. Later Orthodox Judaism sees nakedness as a bad thing.\nAncient Greece.\nIn Ancient Greece, especially Ancient Athens, people did not see a problem with nude men. Nude women were seen as bad, though, and women were forbidden from being nude in public. The Cynics taught that it was bad to have worldly goods. Feelings like shame were also seen as bad. There was nothing wrong with being naked.\nThe Gymnasion shows by its name alone that public nudity was not common in Ancient Greece. The name comes form \"gyn\u00f3s\", which means \"naked\". The gymnasion was used for sports. In Ancient Greece most sports were done totally naked. In most places in Ancient Greece, women were forbidden from doing sports, or from attending sports events.\nThe only place were women were allowed to do sports was Sparta. There, they also did sports, like the men, but separated from these. They were also naked while doing sports.\nAnother place where nakedness was tolerated was in the arts.\nAncient Rome.\nIn Ancient Rome, nudity was nothing special or unusual. It was seen more as a sign of not needing much. People did not attach sexual feelings to it. When the Romans had conquered Ancient Greece, they did not think it was necessary to discuss or forbid that the Olympic Games were done in the nude. Cato the Elder mentions that usually the virtuous Roman worked nude during the summer months.\nCelts, German tribes.\nThe Celtic and Germanic tribes bathed nude in rivers and lakes together and sometimes children grew up nude. Romans also tell us that some of them fought the Romans in the nude.\nJainism and Hinduism.\nBoth Jainism and Hinduism have special monks. In Jainism these are called Digambars (or Digambarras), in Hinduism they are called Sadhus. Both lead an ascetic lifestyle, and are well-respected in their community. Part of this lifestyle is that they wear little or no clothes.\nNudity and sexuality.\nMany cultures that expect some level of modesty associate nudity with sexuality. These cultures usually know striptease in some form. When the difference between the sexes is shown in the main stream media of these cultures this is often seen as sexually related. In Latin cultures the common definition of modesty does not generally allow genital nudity, but the definition of what is lewd has changed and women's breasts are now commonly exposed or depicted without scandal.\nNudity in front of a sexual partner is widely accepted, but there may be restrictions\u2014for example, only at the time and place of sex, or with subdued lighting, during bathing with the partner or afterwards, covered by a sheet or blanket, or while sleeping.\nPublic nudity.\nNudity for social bonding.\nThe Japanese idea of hadaka no tsukiai, or spending time together naked, means classmates, teammates, fellow employees, families or neighbors spend time together naked for social bonding. Usually, this is while bathing at a bathhouse or onsen.\nNudity in sports in history.\nIn Ancient Greece it was seen as normal that the athletes taking part in sporting events, like the Olympic Games were nude, for most events. At that time, women were not allowed to take part or in the games or watch them. Nudity with women was frowned upon.\nIn the 20th century, it was very common for boys to swim nude in the United States. Boys usually found rivers, ponds or lakes to swim in. If there were no girls or adults there, boys just took off their clothes to go swimming. In the United States, recreational (fun) nude swimming (but not school nude swimming) is often called skinny dipping. Boys didn't care if other boys saw them without clothing. Poor boys and farm boys did not even own a bathing suit. Some teenagers, usually boys, still go skinny dipping. It is most common outside of cities.\nUntil the mid-1960s boys were usually nude in swimming pools. From the 1890s until 1962, men and boys used to swim nude at the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association.) The YMCA is an organization with many swimming pools in the United States. After women were allowed to join the YMCA, the rule changed. Nobody could swim nude there.\nAt school swimming pools and public swimming pools there were different hours for boys and girls to swim. Sometimes the pool had bathing suits for girls to wear. Many families did not have money to buy bathing suits for children then.\nTeachers told boys to swim without a bathing suit at most high schools in the United States. It was normal for boys. Swimming nude at school was usually not allowed for girls. (A few schools had nude swimming for girls. At some schools, girls were not allowed to swim at all.) The boys had to swim nude in high schools in Houston, Texas from 1930 or earlier until the mid-1960s. In Chicago, Illinois schools, boys were required to swim nude until in the early 1970s.\nUntil the 1960s, nude swimming was the rule for men at many colleges and universities. Some colleges had only male students. Other colleges had only female students. At colleges with men and women, there were separate pools or different swimming times for men and women.\nIn the United States and Canada, there is not nude swimming at school now.\nNudity in sports today.\nThere are some places where people swim nude. People swim nude at special clothing optional beaches. Usually these are called nude beaches. It is not as common in the United States and Canada as in Europe. Sometimes a city or county owns the beach. Sometimes a state or province owns the beach. Sometimes the federal (national) government owns the beach. Optional means people can swim nude or with a bathing suit. Usually the government does not tell people they must be nude. Each person can choose what to wear.\nSome people have a pool in their house. Some people have an outdoor pool or a pond in their backyard. Some people swim nude in their own pool or pond. Sometimes neighbors complain. Some people swim nude in lakes or rivers when they go camping. Some public pools have special hours or special days for nude swimming. That is more common in indoor public pools.\nClubs for people who like to be nude usually have nude swimming. These are usually called naturist clubs or naturist retreats. A retreat is like a camp or park. It is usually away from the city. Many years ago they were usually called nudist clubs. The name nudist club is less common now. If there is enough space, the club may have other nude sports. They sometimes have nude volleyball or nude basketball. They sometimes have nude soccer (football) if they have a big space. Sometimes people use boats without clothes. People sometimes use a sailboat, rowboat or canoe nude. Sometimes a camp or retreat owned by a church has nude swimming or other sports.\nNudity only with people who are the same age.\nIf there is a swimming pool or pond at a house, sometimes teenagers are happy to swim nude with their teenaged friends or with their brothers or sisters. They might not want to be seen nude by their parents. They might not want to be seen nude by much younger brothers or sisters. Sometimes parents are happy to swim nude with other adults. They might be happy to swim nude with young children. But they might not want to be seen nude by teenagers.\nDifferent behavior at different places.\nSometimes people have different rules (sometimes called social norms) at different places. For example, people in a family might not be naked at home. They might always put a towel around themselves after a shower or bath. But if they go somewhere else, the rules might change. Families sometimes go camping or to a cabin (also called a lake house or beach house or cottage in some places) for a vacation (holiday). The people in that family might swim or lie in the sun nude there. They might eat breakfast together nude. Same people. Different place. What is normal, expected, or comfortable for them changes with the place or situation.\nSome families with an outdoor swimming pool at their house have a no nudity inside the house rule. They swim nude, lie in the sun nude, but they put clothes or a towel on when they come inside the house. The rule may be to show politeness or respect for others. A fancy expression for this is a matter of decorum. It is comparable to a rule like \"mobile devices (like phones) can be used at breakfast but not at the evening meal.\"\nCommon activities in the nude.\nAt least since the early 20th century there is a movement of people wanting to do some things together, while they were nude. Sometimes it was just seen functionally, like a common bath in a pond or lake. Some people do other activities together (in the nude), where being naked is usually not required. For instance, some people prefer nude sunbathing when otherwise a swimsuit could be worn. There are some nude bicycle tours. This movement is generally known as naturism or nudism. In 2009, Appenzell Innerrhoden, a small Swiss canton, voted to stop nude hiking. German tourists have been walking nude through the Alps wearing only boots, socks, and a back pack. The canton will fine nude hikers 200 Swiss francs.\nNudity and health.\nThe Naturism movement of the 20th century claims that being nude is healthy. Starting in 1853, reformer Arnold Rikli said that \"Sun- and air-bathing\" is a good thing, and that it can only give its full potential when done in the nude. Many of these views have been proved wrong today. Not smoking or drinking alcohol is good for health, regardless of whether clothing is worn or not. People suffering from being exposed too little to the sun will also be so if they are clothed. Wearing wet clothes can lead to cystitis (an infection of the urinary bladder).\nSome doctors recommend sleeping in comfortable clothes, or sleeping naked. At some points in time, fashion dictates very tight-fitting clothes. These can be bad for health.\nNudity and the law.\nIn many countries in Europe, being naked in public is not a punishable offense, as long as no one feels molested. Being naked near places where people change clothes is common, and legal in many jurisdictions. Nudity in a public space is often handled by special laws (made for police). In this case, what often happens is the police will fine the offenders, and tell them to go elsewhere. Certain places have started to pass laws, which forbid nudity in certain settings. A well-known case is that of the Canton of Appenzell Inner Rhodes passing a law against hiking naked.\nFor historical reasons, many English-speaking countries are less tolerant towards naked people. Exhibitionists get sexual pleasure from showing themselves naked or partly naked. In the context of the law, exhibitionism is often handled differently.\nSome Western countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, have no laws stopping nude swimming in public areas. In Canada there are many small lakes with few houses or people around. People sometimes swim nude in them. People often swim nude at night or very early in the morning.\nIn the United States there is no federal (national) law against nudity at national beaches. But sometimes there are local laws that say people cannot be nude. Sometimes local police arrest people on federal lands or beaches. Sometimes police use general laws, saying that nudity is disturbing the peace.\nNudity as a form of communication.\nNudity as a form of protest.\nSome people use the nudity as a form of protest, like a movement in the United States that wants equal treatment of bare-chested men, and women. This movement fights for the right of women to be topless. Often this is done with topless demonstrations.\nOne example that nudity was used as a form of protest, even in the Middle Ages is the story of Lady Godiva. She is said to have ridden through Coventry totally naked, only covered by her long hair. She did this to protest against the high taxes.\nUsing nudity for advertising.\nNudity is often used to draw the attention of customers to a given product. That way, nude people or people with very little clothing are often shown on covers of magazines, even if the content of the magazine has nothing to do with nudity. Naked people, sometimes in connection with body painting are used to distribute fliers at events.\nThis uses erotic stimuli, especially to people of the opposite sex. On the other hand, nudity seems to work all by itself in such contexts. Nudity in public places is rare, and people generally do not expect it. The more it is used however, the less it will act on people. At some point it will have become normal.\nNudity and children.\nMost children do not develop a feeling of shame until they are about five years old. For this reason there have been discussions. These discussions try to answer two basic questions:\nDifferent people have different opinions on the subject.\nNude children.\nWorks of art, such as paintings, statues, or photographs have shown nude children, or nude children with nude adults. In recent years, showing nude children has become more and more problematic, especially with photographs. In a few cases, photographs taken by parents showing their toddler or small child naked have been seen as child pornography by courts. In May 2008, police in Sydney, Australia, raided an exhibition by the photographer Bill Henson. This exhibition showed images of naked children. The raid was done on allegations of child pornography. Incidents such as this one sent a strong message to the community.\nChildren seeing their parents nude.\nPeople cannot agree if parents should appear naked in front of their children. Gordon and Schroeder say that there is a wide variation on parental nudity from family to family. According to them, \"there is nothing (..) wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them\". In their opinion, doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to give important information. They note that by ages five to six, children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards.\nBonner recommends against nudity in the home where children are showing sexual behaviour considered problematic.\nA study by Alfred Kinsey found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of them said that there was \"seldom\" nudity in the home, 3% said \"often\", and 17% said that it was \"usual\". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.\nIn a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect. Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.\nChildren seeing other people nude.\nDifferent cultures have different opinions on whether children should see people other than their parents, and other children naked. In general the opinions are also different, depending on how old the child is, and what context the nudity is placed in.\nMany countries have made laws that should protect children from seeing sex scenes on television by accident. That way, such scenes may usually not be shown during the day. British TV must not show such scenes between 5.30am and 9pm. The time when content not suitable for children may be shown is called \"watershed\". The Broadcasting Code requires that \"Nudity before the watershed must be justified by the context.\"\nStudents showering together.\nSometimes the nudity of children in front of other children has been an issue. In Europe, it is common that all students take a shower together after sports classes. Usually showering is segregated by sex.\nIn the United States and some of English-speaking Canada, students at tax funded schools have historically been required to shower with classmates of the same sex after physical education classes. In the United States, public objections and the threat of lawsuits have resulted in a number of school districts in recent years changing policy to make showers optional. Now showering together (sometimes called communal nude showering) after sports is not common anymore at schools in the United States or Canada. Many students wear shorts in the shower. At new schools there are separate (individual) shower stalls (closets) for each student to shower in. At many older schools the showers are never used. Students go to the next class sweaty and smelly. Communal nude showering is still common at colleges, public pools, universities and health clubs.\nAt some public swimming pools, men and women cannot use the same shower room as boys and girls respectively. (These rules are common in Canada and the United States.)\nA court case in the State of Colorado noted that students have a reduced expectation of personal privacy in regards to \"communal undress\" while showering after physical education classes. According to an interview with a middle school principal, most objections to school showers that he had heard were actually from the student's parents rather than from the student.\nThe change in thinking also involves issues of bullying, consideration for gay and other LGBTQ students, and body image (such as very big or very thin students feeling uncomfortable when people see them nude.)\nNudity as a punishment.\nMost people feel uneasy or ashamed when they are nude (outside a social context where this is acceptable). This fact has been used both as a means of torture and as a punishment. That way, during witch-hunts, the alleged witches were stripped to discover what was called the witches' mark. It was believed that the devil left this mark as part of the pact the witch had with him. When the mark was found, this was then used as evidence in the trials.\nNakedness can also be part of a punishment or a public humiliation. Torture manuals sometimes make a difference, as men and women react differently when they are disrobed.\nThe United States and its allies invaded Iraq in 2003. After they had done this, members of the United States Army Reserve abused prisoners. Photographs were circulated that showed that prisoners had to pose naked, were sometimes bound by ropes, and intimidated that way"}

Lutherans in Germany began using it. Swiss and French more often used \"Reformed\". The Anglicans use \"Catholic\", \"Reformed\" and \"Protestant\", however the Anglican Church is not always regarded as part of Protestantism because it kept most of the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church from which it separated.\nMartin Luther, a doctor of theology and a monk, said that the church should return to its roots, and give more weight to what is written in the Bible (Sola scriptura). Luther thought that the Church had gone too far away from the original teachings. He published 95 theses on the way the Catholic Church was then. Some say, he stuck them onto the door of the church of Wittenberg, but others say this is not true. The 95 theses were published in 1516 or 1517.

Mostly, it refers to either sucrose, lactose, or fructose. Sugar is contained in certain kinds of food, or it is added to give a sweet taste.\nRegular sugar extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet (the one commonly added to food) is called \"sucrose\". Fructose is the sugar that is in fruits. As chemicals, sucrose and fructose are both made by two smaller sugars. Glucose is the more common of these smaller sugars. The human body changes regular sugar into the smaller sugars.\nSugars are a kind of carbohydrate. This is because sugars are made from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Carbohydrates can be \"simple carbohydrates\" or \"complex carbohydrates\". Simple carbohydrates are made of only one or a few of the smallest sugars. Complex carbohydrates are made of \"many\" of the smallest sugars.\nStarch is a chemical found in foods such as bread, crackers, and potatoes. It is a \"complex carbohydrate\" that is made from many glucose molecules. When starch is eaten, the human body breaks it apart into smaller sugars. An enzyme is added in the mouth, but it only begins to work in the stomach. Pure starch is actually tasteless in the mouth.\nBrazil produces the most sugar per person and India's total consumption of sugar is the highest for a country.\nThere are other chemical substances that can be used to make a sweet taste, but that are not sugar. One of them, commonly called Stevia, is gained from a plant with the same name. Others, like aspartame, are completely synthetic. In general, these substances are known as artificial sweeteners, or sugar substitutes. People eat them to avoid health problems that sugar causes. \nSugar can be different colours.

It is India's smallest state. It has the second smallest number of people. The total area is 1,430 mi\u00b2 (3,702 km\u00b2), it is bigger than Samoa but smaller than the Georgian territory of South Ossetia. In traditional Indian geography it falls under the South Indian zone. It is on the west coast of India, in the region known as the Konkan. The state of Maharashtra is its neighbour to the north, and Karnataka to the east and south. The Arabian Sea makes up the state's west coast. Panjim is the state's capital, and Margao its largest town. \nPortuguese merchants first landed in Goa in the 16th century but soon after, colonised it. It was a part of the Portuguese empire for about 450 years. In 1961 India took control of Goa by sending its army and defeating Portuguese army.\nHistory.\nThe 1961 Indian annexation of Goa, was an action by India\u2019s armed forces that ended Portuguese rule in its Indian enclaves in 1961. The armed action, code named Operation Vijay by the Indian government, involved air, sea and land strikes for over 36 hours, and was a decisive victory for India, ending 451 years of Portuguese colonial rule in Goa. One of the problems vexing the Indian prime minister Jawarhalal Nehru in the 1950s was what to do about Goa. The situation began to come to a head in 1955 when a group of Goanese and Indian protesters staged a \u2018liberation march\u2019 in Goa and more than 20 of them were shot and killed.\nHe announced that Portuguese control of Goa could be tolerated no longer and instituted a blockade, which the Portuguese regime evaded by building an airport into which to fly supplies and by opening up trade with Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Portuguese dictator, Antonio Salazar tried to drum up international support from world leaders. President Kennedy wrote to Nehru advising him not to use force and the Portuguese ambassador in London reminded the British government that under the terms of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance of 1899 it was obliged to come to Portugal\u2019s assistance if any Portuguese colony was attacked.\nThere were more incidents and in November 1961 the Portuguese in Goa opened fire on Indian fishing boats. Nehru lost patience and mounted a military, naval and air attack on Goa using overwhelming force on December 17th. The Portuguese governor, who had at the most 3,000 men to oppose an Indian army of 30,000, blew up a few bridges to delay the invaders but his situation was plainly hopeless and he hoisted the white flag and surrendered. There had been almost no resistance and few casualties.\nTourism.\nBounded on one side by the foothills of the Sahyadri range and on the other by the Arabian Sea Goa is a green natural paradise and best tourist spots in India. It is very truly said that living in Goa is a 365-day vacation. Goa is one of the best beach destinations in India due to the picturesque sunsets, beaches, historic forts, and laid-back life. Goa serves travelers of varied tastes, whether it's witnessing the majestic 600m high Dudhsagar Falls or trying your luck at Casino Royale. From the famous Fort Aguada to the blue waters. It is from the beaches of Dona Paula and Sinquerim, there is no shortage of points of interest in Goa."}

{"id": "9680", "revid": "1011913", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9680", "title": "Ido", "text": "Ido is a constructed language, a so-called reformed Esperanto, which was developed in 1907. Ido was made by a group of people that thought Esperanto was too hard to be a world language. They did not like how Esperanto used letters with special diacritic marks over them, because that made it hard to type, and they thought that a world language should be easy to learn and write.\nIdo is not as popular as Esperanto, but still about 100-200 people in the world speak it. They have a conference every year where people come together and speak the language.\nSpecial points about Ido.\nIdo is easy to learn for many reasons:\nGrammar (how to use the language).\nEach word in Ido comes from a smaller word called a \"root word\". A root word has a root and an ending. The speaker can take the root and put it on another word to make a new one. For example, \"urbo\" means \"city\" and \"-estro\" means \"leader\". The root of \"urbo\" is \"urb-\", and if -estro is put on the end, it becomes \"urbestro\", which means mayor (leader of a city). Or the speaker can put something on before; chef- means chief or leader, and if the speaker puts that before the word it becomes \"chefurbo\", which means capital city.\nHere are some of the endings:\nPronouns.\nPronouns are the words in a language like I, thou, he, she, it, we, ye, they, and so on. Ido was made from Esperanto, and all of Esperanto's pronouns end in -i. The people that made Ido thought that they sounded too much the same and that it might be too difficult to hear sometimes. Also, most languages have two ways of saying \"you\" so they decided to have two ways of saying you. Lastly, they decided to make a pronoun that can mean \"he\" or \"she\". Some languages like the Finnish language and the Estonian language have something like this.\nHere is a chart of all the pronouns in English, Ido, and Esperanto.\nIdo and Esperanto.\nIdo is a language that came from Esperanto, so they look very similar. Since Esperanto has more speakers than Ido, most people that know Ido first learned Esperanto and then later learned that Ido is a language, too. Sometimes Idists (people who speak Ido) and Esperantists (people who speak Esperanto) do not agree with each other. Luckily they both agree that making a language that everybody can learn is a good idea. Most Idists and Esperantists can understand most of each other's language.\nSamples.\nHere are samples of the language Ido to show what the language looks like. On the right is a page from a magazine in Ido called \"Adavane!\" (forward), written by an Ido group in Spain every two months. This is a page from a diary by a girl named Anne Frank, a Jewish girl from the Netherlands that was killed in 1944 by the German government of Adolf Hitler.\nBelow is a small part of the book \"The Little Prince\" called \"La Princeto\" in Ido.\nLa Princeto.\nCHAPITRO XVII\nMea vido-cirklo (horizonto).\nThis was a song by a bard from Russia named Alexandr Sukhanov; he used words from the poetry of another Russian person named Yunna Mortis. This is the Ido version, sung with guitar.\nConventions.\nPeople who know Ido come together for a few days every year to meet each other and speak the language. Most Ido speakers live in Europe and so the conventions (a meeting of people) have taken place in Europe.\nInformation on Ido conferences (the section that says raporto is the report on the convention written in Ido)."}

That is its core meaning, though the word has a long history, and has been used in many ways. \nA fact is something that has really happened or is actually the case. The usual test for a statement of fact is whether it can be shown to be true. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by careful observation or measurement (by experiments or other means).\nFacts as statements.\nA fact is a statement (a claim) about something that is true. A fact can answer questions like, \"what color is it?\" or \"who made that?\"\nAn opinion is different from a fact. But you can say facts about a person's opinion. For example, someone can ask a question like \"What is Alice's opinion about the book?\" You can answer this question with a fact, for example \"Alice said she likes the book.\" Then it is a fact that Alice \"says\" she likes the book. But maybe Alice does not like the book. So it not a fact that Alice likes the book, but it is a fact that Alice \"says\" she likes the book.\nOne way to learn a fact is if a person can help you see it. For example, if you ask, \"do you have my book?\" To answer this question, a person can let you see your book. Then you can know it is a fact that this person has your book.\nExamples of fact statements.\nThese examples show that there are facts of different kinds.\nScientific theories.\nA scientific theory is knowledge of important facts about a natural thing. The facts in a scientific theory have evidence that shows that the fact is not false. \nA person who understands the scientific method can test to see if the facts of a scientific theory are correct. When statements have been tested and shown to be not false, they may be \"true\". The facts of each scientific theory have usually been questioned and tested by many people. Because of this, we know that the knowledge of a scientific theory is fact and not opinion. Examples of scientific theories include the theory of relativity and the theory of evolution. More simply, it is a fact that the Earth goes around the Sun (and not vice versa). This took so long to establish because a leading religious body had the reverse opinion (see articles on Galileo and Copernicus for the story). Now we can say that there is a difference between statements of fact, and opinions or claimed truths of religion. \"The difference is in the way disputes about the truth are decided\"."}

They are not allowed to throw it, but instead they push the ball out into the air. They \"put\" the ball by holding it at their neck and pushing it through the air. The shot put has been part of the Olympics since 1896. The weight of the ball can vary from 6 to 16 pounds (2.76 to 7.26\u00a0kg), depending on level age and gender of the participants. The main objective of the sport is to throw the ball as far as possible.\nThe Shot put is similar to the javelin. It is an official Olympic event and can be seen at the Olympic games. The athlete cannot wear gloves when they are participating. If wearing gloves, the athlete will be disqualified.\nThe shot put event was first seen in the Middle Ages, when they would throw cannonballs at their enemies.\nIt is an outdoor event and cannot be played inside. It is a track and field event.\nThrowing technique.\nThere are two types of putting styles: \"glide\" and \"spin\" (rotation). The glide was invented in the US in the year 1876. The spin was also developed in the US. It was invented by Parry O'Brian and made famous by Brian Oldfield.\nHistory.\nShot put was originally used in the Olympics to see who was the strongest athlete. Each athlete threw from a wooden square, and could only stand to throw. The shot put was a large stone ball. That is now a metal not softer than brass."}

{"id": "9700", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9700", "title": "Owl", "text": "Owls are animals in the order Strigiformes. There are 200 species, and they are all animals of prey. Most of them are solitary and nocturnal; in fact, they are the only large group of birds which hunt at night. Owls are specialists at night-time hunting animals. They feed on small mammals such as rodents, insects, and other birds, and a few species like to eat fish as well. \nAs a group, owls are very successful. They are found in all parts of the world except Antarctica, most of Greenland, and some small islands.\nOwl families.\nThere are two families of owls: the true owls and the barn owls:\nAppearance.\nAn owl has a big head, flat face, hooked beak, short tail, and sharp talons, The wings of an owl are long. Owls have brown, gray, or white plumage with streaks or spots.\nAdaptations.\nOwls have a suite of adaptations which help them to be successful.\nOwls have large eyes and holes for ears, a hawk-like beak, and a rather flat face. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the owl's eyes are facing forwards to help it see better in the dark. Their eyes are also fixed inside their sockets, so they have to turn their whole head to look at other things. Owls can rotate their heads and necks up to 270 degrees in both directions. \nOwls are good at looking at things far from its eyes, but it cannot see anything clearly within a few centimeters of their eyes. Owls use small feathers on the beak and the feet that help it feel the prey it catches.\nHunting.\nMost owls hunt at night, and in twilight (dawn and dusk). A few owls are also active during the day.\nThe owls' hunting depends on surprising its prey. Their most important adaptation is their almost silent flight. The feathers are soft, with fringes on the back edge, and the base of each is downy. This all muffles noise, and makes for silence. Also, they glide when coming in for the kill. \nThe dull colors of the owls' feathers make them less visible by camouflaging the owl. This helps them as they roost during the day. \nOwls have fantastic hearing. The shape of the head helps slight sounds reach the ears. The feathers of the facial disc are arranged in order to increase sound delivered to the ears. Their ears are asymmetrical allowing the owl to locate a sound. They can hear a mouse move in the grass. \nAn owl's sharp beak and powerful talons allow it to kill its prey before swallowing it whole, unless it is too big. Owls usually regurgitate the parts of their prey that they cannot digest. These parts include bones, scales, and fur. Scientists who study the things that owls eat can get clues by studying the parts that the owl spit back out, called \"owl pellets\". These \"owl pellets\" are often sold by companies to schools for use in the students' biology and ecology lessons.\nWinter larder.\nMany animals store food during times of plenty to prepare for leaner times. Owls may store dead mice for winter. \nSwivelling the head.\nOwls have special adaptations which help them swivel their heads 270 degrees. They have 14 neck vertebrae instead of our seven. Also, the big carotid arteries, instead of being on the side of the neck as in humans, are carried close to the centre of rotation just in front of the spine. So these arteries get much less twisting and stretching, and the potential for damage is greatly reduced. This arrangement is seen in other birds, but in owls the vertebral arteries \u2013 the vessels that travel through channels in the neck bones \u2013 are given extra space.\nOwls also have wide parts in their carotid arteries just under the base of the skull. Researchers found these could dilate and fill with a reservoir of blood. \"We believe this is kind of a new structure not really known before\", said a researcher. \"It's probably a way to pool blood and get some continuity of flow even if there is disruption below at the next level\".\nOwls in culture.\nMythology and stories that include owls are: "}

The slang term \"bootleg\" (from the use of boots to smuggle items) is often used to describe illegally copied material.\nSome people call illegally copying movies and music, \"piracy\" or \"theft\". Richard Stallman says people should not call copying and distribution \"piracy\", because piracy is robbery with attacking ships, killing and stealing people, and owners of copyright use the word to say that such copying is as evil as piracy. Some courts say that the word \"piracy\" may be used, but the word \"theft\" may not be used. When people use the word \"piracy\" for copyright infringement, it usually means \"selling of many copies without permission\", but sometimes any \"big copyright infringement\".\nMotivation.\nThere are a few reasons why people violate copyrights. Copyright infringed goods are usually cheaper than legal ones, because the people distributing them don't need to pay for the copyright. That can make them easier to sell. Normal goods might also not be as useful as copyright infringed ones because of legal limitations.\nInternet piracy.\nCopyright laws have tried to keep up with the development of technology, such as radio, television, and the internet. Now many people upload some articles to websites that allow people to read free articles on it without the permission of the author. In this way, people can read many articles easily, but it is illegal. As a result, many authors prosecute the website.\nThe normal behaviors of copy infringement.\nHere are the normal behaviors of copy infringement.\nThe harm of copyright infringement.\nPiracy goods are usually at low price because they don't need to pay for copyright and carry out research. So it is popular with the people who don't have awareness of copyright. On the surface, it will limit the monopoly of big company. But in fact, it is a means of unfair competition and damages the fair competition pattern. What's more, it will have a bad consequence on the competitiveness of middle or small sized companies.\nBenefits of copyright infringement.\nThere are some benefits to society of limiting copyright. One is to expand readership of newspapers and books to a wider section of the public. Newspapers were once relatively expensive, but copies were freely available in coffee houses throughout Europe. The invention of public libraries had the same effect for books. Many great people in the 18th and 19th century came from poor backgrounds. Such people as Michael Faraday (the son of a blacksmith) and Alfred Russel Wallace had no university education, but used libraries to get their knowledge up-to-date. The aim of copyright law is to have a balance between these two sides: the needs of authors and publishers, and the broader needs of society.\nExamples.\n1.Well-known writers vs. Baidu On March 15, 2011, HanHan and many other well-known writers prosecuted Baidu Library because it allowed people to read and download their articles for free. They asked Baidu to pay for it but Baidu rejected the compensation.\n2.Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services (1996)\nMichigan Document Services was involved in creating packages of study material for the students of the university. A professor supplied the course material and Michigan Document services, a photocopying organization, took photocopies of the material and converted it into a booklet for sale to students at the university.\nHere was a clause of \"Fair use\" in this case. The photocopying company could have paid a nominal fee to the university and then used the material. This was available to anyone who wished to use the material. However, the photocopying company paid for only the original and then started making photocopies of the study material. The court considered that it was not \"fair use\" and penalized the photocopying company.\n3.A &amp; M Records vs. Napster (2001)\nThis is one of the most famous cases of copyright infringement related to the music industry. As peer to peer file sharing increased, Napster started a website. This website offered downloads of songs of all genres \u2013 new and old. You may know someone who used it. A &amp; M Records brought in a joint copyright infringement case which accused Napster of stealing music and making it available to people worldwide. Before closing the site in 2002, Napster had to settle US$26 million to different recording companies and songwriters. It could have even more if Napster had not apologized and folded the site.Several websites still thrive on offering free music to people who can download it at no cost. As mentioned in our article on \"Internet Ethics and Copyright Laws\", the music industry faces most copyright infringement cases. The Napster case, though an example of the consequences, still does not act as a deterrent for other music websites that offer free music downloads.\nThe opinions of the public.\nAs opposed to the writers, many people think it's convenient and cheap to read books and other articles on the internet. They think free articles are good for them. On the other hand, some people think it is illegal to provide free articles download without authors permission. They think the best way to avoid this problem is to pay for reading on the Internet.\nCopyright test case.\nIn 2014 selfies taken by a crested black macaque seemed to establish a legal precedent, after the Wikimedia Foundation rejected a copyright claim.\nThe photos had been sold widely by David Slater, a professional nature photographer, whose camera was temporarily carried away by a group of macaques. After the photos were uploaded to Wikipedia, the organisation refused to delete them, claiming \"This file is in the public domain, because as the work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is vested."}

International Women's Day has been observed since 1909 in the United States. After a while the people of United States stopped celebrating this holiday. In the 1920s Soviet Union, and then some other Communist countries like China and Cuba, started celebrating this day as a holiday for women and world peace. Since then the holiday has become more and more popular around the world.\nIn many places, the day does not have a political aspect, and is simply a time for men to express their love for women. It is similar to a mixture of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day. Men present their mothers, wives, girlfriends, colleagues, etc. with flowers and small gifts. In some countries International Women's Day is observed like Mother's Day, where children give small gifts to their mothers and grandmothers. In some countries, women get a half day off work. Often, schools will have a celebration where students will honor their teachers.\nIn 1975, the United Nations also started to recognize this holiday for women's rights. The UN chooses a political or social theme for the holiday each year. For example, the 2011 theme was \"\"Equal access to education, training and science and technology: Pathway to decent work for women.\" and the 2012 theme is \"Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world\". In this way, the holiday is a time to look at the social and economic problems women have around the world.\nInternational Women's Day is now an official holiday in Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Georgia, Italy, Israel, Laos, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam."}

It has a long blade, and a handle called a hilt. Often there is some form of hand protection, such as a cross-guard or a basket. It can be used either for cutting, slashing or stabbing, depending on the type of sword.\nSwords were first created from bronze by blacksmiths in Ancient Egypt in 1150 BCE. Soon other cultures adopted them, and they began to spread quite quickly. Before guns were invented, swords were much more common as a weapon. After the invention of the gun, swords remained as \"sidearms\", as secondary weapons used in man-to-man fight once the battle lines had contacted after shooting. Since after the American Civil War, swords have not been used as much by armies, except as a ceremonial part of uniforms. Some guns, however, have bayonets to perform the same function.\nToday, Sport fencing, is an Olympic games sport which uses very light swords and a strict scoring system. Western Martial Arts use swords that are much closer to the original blades, such as longswords, rapiers and sabres. The blades used are blunt, but they are much heavier than a sport fencing sword, which means the fencers need much more armour. Likewise, the Japanese sport kendo is swordplay in armour with two-handed bamboo swords called shinai.\nTypes of swords.\nThere are many kinds of swords. One kind of sword is a \"sabre\" (or \"saber\"). A sabre is a curved, light sword, sharpened on one side and at the tip, and was generally used on horseback. A \"broadsword\" is a straight sword that is sharp on both sides and at the tip. A rapier is long and thin, with a basket protecting the hand. Another type of sword is a \"foil\", used in sport fencing, and is long and thin, with a button at the tip to protect the fencers from injury. Larger swords, such as Longswords or claymores are used with two hands. In Eastern martial Arts, swords like the Katana are used. A Katana has one sharp edge and a small guard near the handle. Some Katanas are used with one hand, while other larger versions are used with two hands.\nFamous swords.\nThe sword of King Arthur, Excalibur, is one of the most famous swords, although it is suspected it is legendary and does not exist.\nIn a Vietnamese legend, the Dragon King gives a sword called Heaven's Will to Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i so he can free Vietnam from the Chinese.\nThe Frisian freedom fighters Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama are known to have wielded swords of great size. Donias sword was a long as 210\u00a0cm (seven feet) and weighed 7\u00a0kg (15\u00a0lbs). The swords are kept in the Frisian Museum in Leeuwarden."}
{"id": "9714", "revid": "7889794", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9714", "title": "Moses", "text": "Moses (; in both the Septuagint and the New Testament; , \"\") is a person in Abrahamic religions. He was a religious leader, lawgiver, and prophet according to the Hebrew Bible. Generally, he is also seen as the author of the Torah. \nHe is often called \"Moshe Rabbenu\" in Hebrew (, Lit. \"Moses our Teacher/Rabbi\") and seen as the most important prophet in Judaism. Christianity, Islam, the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, and the Rastafari, also see him as an important prophet. Moses has also been an important symbol in American history, from the first settlers up until the present.\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people were increasing in number and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might help Egypt's enemies. Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed, and he ended up being adopted into the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slave-master, Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian where he tended the flocks of Jethro, a priest of Midian on the slopes of Mt. Horeb. After the Ten Plagues were unleashed on Egypt, Moses led the Hebrew people out of Egypt, across the Red Sea, where they based themselves at Horeb and compassed the borders of Edom. It was at this time that Moses received the Ten Commandments. Despite living to the age of 120, Moses died before reaching the Land of Israel.\nEarly life.\nMoses was born of the Levi tribe. The new Pharaoh, afraid of the ever-growing Israelite population, ordered every new-born Hebrew boy to be thrown into the Nile River, but let every girl live. Moses' mother Jochebed gave birth and kept him hidden for three months from Pharaoh's soldiers. When she could no longer keep him hidden, she fashioned a basket lined with tar and pitch, and placed him in the reeds along the riverbank, while his sister Miriam kept watch from a distance.\nA princess, one of pharaoh's daughters, went down to the Nile to bathe. There she discovered a crying baby and noticed he was a Hebrew child. Joining the attendants, Moses' sister offered to find a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for the princess, who agreed. Bringing Moses' real mother, the princess asked her to be the baby's wet nurse, for which she was paid. When the child grew older, she took him to pharaoh's daughter, who named him Moses, saying, \"I drew him out of the water.\"\nMoses grew up a privileged member of the court. He was well educated academically and physically. He was taught hand-to-hand combat tactics and leadership.\nUpon adulthood, he killed an Egyptian guard who was beating a Hebrew slave and had to leave Egypt because the Pharaoh tried to kill him.\nThe Burning Bush.\nMoses fled to Midian, where he married Jethro's daughter, Zipora. Zipora had two sons. The old Pharaoh died and the Israelites cried loudly. God heard him. One day Moses was tending his father-in-law, Jethro's, sheep and came to Mount Horeb. God's angel made a bush burn with fire, but it did not burn up. When he came nearer, God spoke to him and ordered him to remove his shoes as he was on holy land. God commanded him to be a leader for the Israelites and bring them out of Egypt. At first Moses did not want to do it and said that he was not good with words, but God commanded him and gave Aaron, his brother, to speak for him. Moses returned to Egypt and told the elders what happened.\nMoses and the Pharaoh.\nMoses then went to the Pharaoh and asked him to let the Israelites go. However the Pharaoh did not agree. Finally God inflicted ten plagues upon the Egyptians before Pharaoh agreed to release the Israelites. The last plague was the killing of all first-born, both human and animals. However, to save the Israelites, they were instructed to mark their doors with blood from a lamb, so that the avenging angel would see it and know to \"pass over\" that house.\nThe Pharaoh finally decided to let the Israelites go who then migrated in large numbers from Egypt. The Pharaoh later changed his mind and followed Moses and his people with an army to attack them. But Moses made the Red Sea to part and give way for Israelites to pass. The Israelites were safe but the Pharaoh's army was destroyed.\nJourney in the Wilderness.\nMoses led the Israelites through the wilderness, and God gave them manna and quails to eat, and water from rocks to drink. He also caused the Amalekites to lose in a battle. When Moses came to Mount Sinai, he went up to receive the Ten Commandments and other laws from God. The Ten Commandments were written by God on two tablets. God also told him the instructions of the priests' duties. Moses was up the mountain for forty days and forty nights.\nWhen the people waited for Moses and did not find him, they made Aaron, his brother, make a calf out of gold and worshiped it. God warned Moses about it, and when Moses came down and saw what they did, he was so angry that the tablets fell and they smashed into pieces. The people of Levi tribes are commanded to kill people who worshiped the calf.\nLater on Moses asked God to forgive the people. God wrote for Moses two more tablets, and put them in the Ark. Moses also asked craftsmen to make the Tabernacle as God wanted.\nTo some people, Moses is the founder of the philosophy of law as well as such modern legal doctrines as independent judiciary and separation of powers..\nLater life.\nWhile the Israelites were wandering around the wilderness, Moses was the one to whom God spoke. However, the people kept complaining about the hardships. God instructed Moses to send twelve spies to scout the land God is giving to them; however some of them became afraid because the people living there looked stronger and more powerful than they. They told the others not to go there. Only Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, reported the truth as God wanted. God decided because of this that the Israelites would wander forty years in the wilderness, and every one except Joshua and Caleb from that generation would die without seeing the promised land.\nGod gave many laws to the Israelites through Moses. Moses made Joshua take over him before he died.\nMoses died before he reached Canaan, the land God was leading his people to. He was 120 years old when he died.\nToday Jews around the world follow the laws of the Ten Commandments and the Torah that God gave to them through Moses. He is also believed to be a prophet by Muslims.\nThe Historical Moses.\nThe Bible, the Torah, and the Quran have references to a person called \"Moses\" in them. The name they give to the person, varies. Other people also have written about Moses. These include Tacitus and Strabo. It is not known how much these descriptions have taken from earlier sources, which may now have been lost.\nNo other written records from countries such as Egypt or Assyria have been found, that are from before about 850 BCE and that tell about the stories of the Bible or its main characters. There is no known physical evidence (such as pottery shards or stone tablets) to say that Moses' really existed. Pharaohs have ordered the destruction of records that put them into a bad light. Several cartouches from monuments have also been destroyed in different epochs of Ancient Egyptian history.\nIt looks like the story written about Moses in the Bible has two different sources. There were two groups of people who told the story. The two stories were passed on separately. Only later were they combined into the version that can now be found in the Bible. Passing on the stories from one generation to the next has perhaps also introduced inaccuracies. Some people added things to the story when they told it. They also omitted other things.\nCriticism.\nAccording to the Torah, Moses ordered the death penalty for many offences. He also had defeated enemies killed. Jews, Christians and Muslims consider him to be a holy figure. For this reason, criticism of these passages of the Hebrew Bible has been left to others.\nIn the late eighteenth century, for example, the deist Thomas Paine commented at length on Moses' Laws in \"The Age of Reason\". Paine also gave his view that \"the character of Moses, as stated in the Bible, is the most horrid that can be imagined\", giving the story at as an example. In the nineteenth century the agnostic Robert G. Ingersoll wrote \"...that all the ignorant, infamous, heartless, hideous things recorded in the 'inspired' Pentateuch are not the words of God, but simply 'Some Mistakes of Moses'\". In the 2000s, the atheist Richard Dawkins referring to the same passage like Paine, concluded, \"No, Moses was not a great role model for modern moralists.\""}

Israel split off from a kingdom called Judah, whose people were later called Jews. Israel was conquered by the Assyrians in 721 BCE. Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. Many Jews were taken away from Judah. When the Achaemenid Empire defeated the Babylonians they let the Jews return to rebuild the Second Temple in Jerusalem about 70 years later."}

It feeds by hunting. It lives in Asia, mainly India, Bhutan, China, Korea and Siberian Russia. Tigers are solitary animals.\nAppearance.\nTigers have orange fur with black stripes, and a white belly. The black stripes usually extend to the white underside. The stripes are used to keep them camouflaged while hunting. Usually, no two tigers have the same pattern of stripes.\nThere are tigers with different colors. There are sometimes white tigers that have white fur with black stripes, or that even have pure white fur. They have orange or red eyes. Most Bengal tigers have orange fur. The white coat only appears once in every 100\nbirths. The Bengal tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh and India.\nTigers vary in size depending on their subspecies. Siberian tigers are the largest. Males can grow to at least long (body length) and weigh about . Females are a bit smaller. Record weight for males is claimed as 890\u00a0lbs (318\u00a0kg), but this cannot be confirmed.\nWhere they live.\nTigers can live in a variety of habitats. Mostly they need to hide, to be near a water source, and have enough prey to eat. Tigers are solitary and they all control large amounts of territory, the size of which depends on the availability of food and prey. According to Tigers-World, a male tiger may live and hunt in an area of 60 to 100 square kilometers (23 to 39 square miles). A female tiger may have 20 square kilometers (8 square miles). According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a single tiger can live in a territory as small as 21 square kilometers (8 square miles) to as large as 995 square kilometers (385 square miles). Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests. These include the wet, evergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats.\nSubspecies.\nAs previously thought, the tiger had five living subspecies. In this context, 'recently' means in the last two centuries. Three tiger subspecies are extinct (\u2020). \nHowever, in 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger populations in continental Asia as \"P. t. tigris\", and those in the Sunda Islands as \"P. t. sondaica\".\nTigers and humans.\nChinese Tigers are becoming rare, because people hunt them for their silk coat skin and destroy the habitats they live in. The Bengal tiger has the largest population with 3,500 left in the wild. To help keep the tiger population, tigers are often placed in zoos. In order for tigers to survive into the next century, governments throughout the tigers\u2019 range must show greater determination and commitment to conserve tigers and their habitats.\nChinese tigers have been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. Body parts such as their whiskers and bones are used to treat things such as toothaches, malaria, and burns.\nDiet.\nTigers eat many types of prey, mostly other large mammals. Some examples are deer, monkeys, wild rabbits, wild pigs, tapirs, buffalo and other animals found in Asia. All are meat eaters. Some tigers may eat up to of meat a day. Tigers kill their prey by clamping down on the prey's throat and suffocating it."}

It lives in Africa and Asia.\nUnlike lions, it does not live in groups. The adult males live separately, and the females live only with their cubs. Leopards live in habitats where there are some trees. They climb trees well, and do so regularly. They can carry prey up a tree and keep it safe from hyaenas and lions. Trees are its main escape from attacks by lions or packs of dogs. It is an ambush predator, and operates best where it has some cover.\nThe most similar cat in its lifestyle is the jaguar, which lives in Central and South America.\nAppearance.\nLeopards generally have yellow fur with dark rosettes and spots, and a lighter colored underside. But there can be a lot of differences in the different leopard subspecies. There are also often leopards who are completely black, those are also called black panthers. Male leopards are about 30% larger than female leopards.\nHabitat.\nOriginally the leopard lived in all of Africa (but not in the Sahara) and southern Asia. But today many leopard subspecies, especially in Asia, are endangered. Leopards live in a lot of different environments: rainforests, forests, mountains and savannas.\nLife style.\nThe leopard is mostly active at night. It is basically an ambush hunter. It can climb very well, and it stays up in trees a lot of its time. Leopards usually live alone and try not to meet another leopard. They only come together to mate. Young leopards leave their mothers after 13 \u2013 18 months.\nHunting and diet.\nLeopards hunt at different times, and they also use different methods for hunting. Most often leopards will secretly move towards their prey and attack it when they are close, or hide and wait for it to come close.\nLeopards are versatile, opportunistic hunters, and have a very wide diet. Leopards are carnivores.Leopards are apex predators. They prey on antelope, zebras, warthogs, buffalo, wildebeest, wild boar and deer, but they also prey on rodents, hares, fish, birds, snakes, lizards, turtles, monkeys and even jackals. Leopards are the only natural predators of adult chimpanzees and gorillas, though probably not the large male silverback gorillas. Leopards do not usually eat humans, but sometimes leopards that are hurt or sick can eat people when they do not have enough to eat. A leopard in India is believed to have eaten more than 125 people.\nSubspecies.\nThere are nine subspecies of leopards recognized today, one in Africa and eight in Asia. They are:"}

It is also the largest and most powerful feline in the Western Hemisphere.\nBecause of its spots, jaguars look like leopards, though it is usually larger and stronger, and its behavior is more like that of a tiger. It likes to stay near water, and like the tiger, it is famous for being a big cat that enjoys swimming. It usually hunts alone.\nThe jaguar has a very powerful strong bite, even compared to other big cats. Because of its strong bite, jaguars can bite through armoured reptiles like caimans, crocodiles, turtles and tortoises. Jaguars kill their prey in an unusual way: they bite directly through the skull between the ears and into the brain.\nAppearance.\nJaguars have yellow or sometimes yellow-orange fur with brown and black rosettes and spots. They are big and heavy and also have very strong muscles which makes them really powerful.They cannot climb well, but they can swim.\nSometimes there are jaguars who are completely black, but if you look closely you can still see the spots. They are called \"black panther\" or just \"panther\".\nThis is a 'colour morph' of the same species, a kind of polymorphism.\nHabitat.\nJaguars live in South America and Central America. They mostly live in rainforests, but also in savannas, swamps, grasslands, forest, deserts and open areas.\nLife.\nJaguars are not specialized with their food, but eat almost anything they get: big and small mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and livestock. It is an ambush predator. When hunting, they usually try to secretly get very close to the prey, and then the jaguar suddenly jumps at it and throws it down. The jaguar bites the skull of its prey to kill it. It then takes the prey to a safe place and eats it.\nAfter a pregnancy of about 100 days the female gives birth to usually 1 - 4 babies. The young leave their family after 1\u20132 years, and they become mature at about 3 years. Jaguars can live up to 10\u201312 years old in freedom, but in captivity (such as in zoos) they can live to 20\u201322 years old."}
{"id": "9800", "revid": "1070632", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9800", "title": "Cheetah", "text": "A cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus\") is a medium large cat which lives in Africa. It is the fastest land animal and can run up to 112 kilometers per hour for a short time. Most cheetahs live in the savannas of Africa. There are a few in Asia. Cheetahs are active during the day, and hunt in the early morning or late evening.\nCharacteristics.\nThe cheetah compared to other big cats is light and slimly built. Its long thin legs and long spotted tail are necessary for fast running. Its lightly built, thin form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of other big cats. The head-and-body length ranges from . The cheetah stands 70 to 90\u00a0cm at the shoulder, and weighs .\nThe slightly curved claws are only weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the other big cats, which have fully retractable claws.\nDiet and Behavior.\nCheetahs are active during the day, and hunt in the early morning or late evening. Cheetahs are carnivores. They prey on antelope, wildebeest, zebras, warthogs, hares, birds, rodents, snakes, fish, lizards and even jackals.\nWhen the cheetah hunts, it slowly and secretly moves toward its prey. When it is close to the prey (about 10\u201330 meters), it runs after it very quickly. Cheetahs kill their prey by tripping it during the chase. To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it to death. A bite on the back of the neck or the snout is enough to kill smaller prey.\nThe cheetah cannot defend itself against lions or hyenas who would take the cheetah's prey away. The prey is taken to a shaded place. The cheetah, exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for some time. Once they recover, cheetahs eat quickly, and consume large quantities as soon as they can.\nReproduction.\nPregnant females give birth to about 3 to 5 cubs or kittens after three months pregnancy. It takes two years of full-time supervision by the mother before the cubs are ready to live independent lives. They need to learn how to catch prey, and that takes time. The young are vulnerable to larger predators: lions especially try to kill cheetahs.\nGenetics.\nThe cheetah has unusually low genetic variability and a very low sperm count. Their sperms also suffer from deformed flagellae, and so their movement is damaged. Apparently, cheetahs went through a great reduction in numbers during the last ice age. Inbreeding after the event further reduced the variation (genetic drift). \nCheetah as a pet.\nDue to the fact that cheetahs never attack and kill humans they were extremely popular as hunting pets since antiquity and especially in medieval times in the Near and Middle East.\nIn modern times, cheetahs probably are the most difficult wilds cats to have as pets, due to the necessity for wide open spaces for cheetah for them to run at full speed . It's very important to feed them properly, because cheetahs in captivity must eat only lean steamed meat so they don't get sick and perish.\nInteresting facts.\nThe cheetah is the fastest of the land dwellers.\nThe acceleration of a cheetah allows it to reach speeds of up to hundreds of kilometers per hour in three seconds (its maximum speed is 112 kilometers per hour). The speed that a cheetah can develop from the start in 3 seconds cannot be achieved by any sports racing car."}

Its crystal structure is a framework of SiO4 silicon\u2013oxygen tetrahedra. Each shares an oxygen atom with another tetrahedron, so the overall chemical formula is SiO2 or silica.\nThere are many different varieties of quartz, some of which are semi-precious gemstones. They have been used for a long time to make jewelry and hardstone carvings. Agate, amethyst, rose quartz are all forms of quartz.\nQuartz crystals are used in oscillators, for example in quartz clocks. People also extract the silicon to make semiconductors.\nThe majority of sand is small quartz bits. Quartz has a mineral hardness of 7. (mohs scale).\nThe word \"quartz\" comes from the German word \"quarz\".\n'Fused quartz' is glass made of silica in non-crystalline form. It does not contain other ingredients that are added to other glass to lower the melting point. Fused silica has high working and melting temperatures. For some purposes, fused quartz is better than other types of glass due to its purity. The glass is used in a number of high-tech products.\nShocked quartz.\nShocked quartz is a form of quartz that has a microscopic structure different from normal quartz. Under intense pressure (but limited temperature), the crystalline structure of quartz is deformed along planes inside the crystal. These planes show up as lines under a microscope.\nShocked quartz is found worldwide, especially in impact craters and in the thin Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary layer. This is at the contact between Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks. It is further evidence (in addition to iridium enrichment) that the transition between the two geologic periods was caused by a large impact. Eugene Shoemaker discovered it in building stones in the Bavarian town of N\u00f6rdlingen. The stones were from shocked metamorphic rocks, such as breccia, of a meteor crater."}

They performed for more than 30 years, and have sold more than 200 million (200,000,000) albums. They are famous for their live shows and deep music. Most of their albums are concept albums, which means every song is linked through a theme. Their first album was \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\", which was released in 1967. Their latest album is \"The Endless River\", which was released in November 2014. The band were named after the blues artists \"Pink Anderson\" and \"Floyd Council\" by Syd Barrett, one of the band's founder members. In 2005, they played at a concert called Live Aid after 24 years of not playing together. The line up was David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright. They have made some very popular albums including \"The Dark Side of the Moon,\" which was released in 1973 and \"The Wall,\" which was released in 1979. After Richard Wright died in 2008, David Gilmour has said that he does not want to reunite, despite Roger saying he might want to. It is now believed that David Gilmour and Roger Waters are friends after becoming enemies for a long time.\nEarly history.\nSyd Barrett started the group, and played guitar and sang in the band. He left soon after, at the start of 1968, because of a mental illness that was made worse by heavy drug use. The other people in the band were Roger Waters (bass guitar and vocals), David Gilmour (lead guitar and vocals), Richard Wright (keyboard and vocals), and Nick Mason (drums). David Gilmour joined the band in 1968. Roger Waters quit the band in 1985. \nDuring most of their career, they played a kind of rock music that some people call \"progressive rock\".\nLater history.\nThe original members of Pink Floyd met in an architectural college. The band started as a blues band. Later, under Syd Barrett's leadership, they played music that was psychedelic in style. After Barrett left the band, they started to play longer and more complicated songs, and to play at a lot of colleges and universities. Soon, they were famous as studio musicians who loved to experiment with music. On the album \"Atom Heart Mother\", from 1970, they used a brass band and a choir.\nThey used a lot of things to make their concerts interesting to watch. They had a round movie screen on the stage. They would show videos on the screen when they played. They also used lighting and lasers in a much fancier way than many bands do. They also had big balloon puppets. The most famous is in the shape of a pig, which first appeared on the cover for their album, \"Animals\". The pig has since become a symbol of Pink Floyd. Another symbol that reminds people of Pink Floyd is a prism with light shining through it. This was on the cover of \"Dark Side of the Moon\", one of their most popular albums. The album was released in 1973, and stayed on music charts for a very long time. Millions of people bought it.\nThe album \"The Wall\", recorded in 1979, was also famous. It was made into a movie, directed by Alan Parker, in 1982. That album is important to the history of the group. It talks about the distance they put between them and their fans. It was the last album they all worked on together before starting to split up. \nRoger Waters forced Richard Wright to leave the band in 1979, but Wright came back in 1987, after Waters quit. Waters tried to sue the other members so that they could not call themselves Pink Floyd without him, but he did not succeed. Because of this and other reasons, there was a lot of anger and bitterness between Waters and the other members of the band, especially Gilmour.\nPink Floyd without Roger Waters.\nThe last album of new songs that Pink Floyd released is called \"The Division Bell\". It was made in 1994, when Pink Floyd also played their last concert tour. The very last time that Pink Floyd played was in 2005, as part of the Live 8 concerts for charity. Waters sang with the band for the first time since leaving the band. It was a big surprise to many people who thought Pink Floyd would never play together again, especially not with Roger Waters.\nSyd Barrett died of pancreatic cancer in 2006. Richard Wright died of cancer in 2008.\nIn 2014, Pink Floyd released their first album in over 20 years: \"The Endless River\"."}

{"id": "9958", "revid": "7859252", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9958", "title": "Transgender", "text": "Transgender people are people who identify, or feel, different from their assigned sex at birth. It's been considered a gender modality in which gender identity differs from the assigned at birth.\nDefinitions.\nThe word \"transgender\" may describe many different people. People with different ideas about their genders may think of themselves as transgender. These people use different words to describe their gender. The term \"trans people\" is often used as a short version of \"transgender people\".\nSome common definitions of the words used in this article are listed here:\nThese definitions are important to help understand that what people look like outside (sex) is not always the same as how they feel inside (gender). Some people do not fit into the \"gender binary\".\nWho is transgender?\nThere are many subgroups of people who are included in the in the term transgender. It is important that not all transgender people fit into these groups. Some of the bigger groups are:\nThe following groups of people are \"not\" necessarily transgender:\nHistory.\nPeople like those who, in modern Western societies, are now identified as transgender or transsexual, have been documented in many cultures and for thousands of years. However, only in the last century have science and medicine developed ways to change the bodies of trans people who want this.\nPeople who have traits that are different from the sex they are born with, have been accepted in some societies, both historically and now. For example, some Native American tribes accepted \"two-spirit\" people. Similarly a Tongan person born with a male body who acts and dresses in a female way is known in the local dialect as a \"fakaleiti\".\nThe \"hijra\" in India are born physically male, but live as women, including dressing and socializing as female. In the past they used to castrate themselves and even remove the penis in order to urinate through a small hole. Now, with the arrival of western medicine, many hijari choose to take hormone therapies and sometimes have sex reassignment surgery. Many of these people still call themselves \"hijra\", but some now call themselves \"transsexuals\" or \"transgender women\". The role of hijari in society is complex and varied throughout all of India.\nIn Western Society, there have often been people who have chosen to act and dress in a way that was not gender specific, or was not that of the sex they were assigned at birth. This is not the same as being transgender. Cross dressing actors were very popular in the theatre of the late 19th century.\nAn example of a transgender person is the 19th century military surgeon who was known as James Barry. It is now believed that Barry was born female but disguised his sex all his adult life. Barry's work, which saved, and helped thousands of lives by improving treatment of wounds to stop amputations, would not have been possible, as a woman, because as a female he could never have attended medical school or entered the army.\nA 20th century example of a transgender person is Jan Morris, a geographer, explorer and journalist, who began life as James Morris. As \"James\", Morris married and had children, but felt female and eventually became Jan Morris.\nIssues.\nTrans - the \"T\" in LGBT.\nTransgender people are not accepted in every society. They suffer discrimination, violence, and even murder. Transgender people have fought for and have gained many rights and protections in some societies. In many places the fight for transgender rights is associated with the fight for gay and bisexual rights. Together these groups are sometimes described by the acronym \"LGBT\" for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender.\nHowever, some transgender people do not want to be a part of the LGB (lesbian, gay and bisexual) community, as they may see themselves as heterosexual and not feel like they belong with gay or queer people, and some LGB people do not want to be a part of the transgender community, as they may be transphobic, which means that they may have a fear or dislike of transgender people, or they may not want heterosexuals to see sexuality and gender identity as the same thing. However, gay and transgender people often have some of the same problems in society, so many gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people try to work together to solve all of their problems.\nMental health.\nMany transgender people have mental health problems. A 2012 study of British transgender people found that 84% had considered suicide. 55% had been diagnosed with depression. 33% had not been diagnosed with depression, but thought that they had it in the past or at the time of the survey. 53% had self-harmed. 38% of had been diagnosed with anxiety. 31% were using antidepressants and 44% had used them at some time.\nA study of 164 Irish transgender people found that 80% had considered suicide. 40% of those had attempted suicide at least once. 44% had self-harmed. The reason for these high numbers is often seen as a result of discrimination and social problems. Others believe that it is because transgender people are mentally ill.\nSome studies show that Transgender people have better mental health and commit suicide less often when they live as their preferred gender.\nMedical care.\nTransgender people who want to take medicine and have surgery to change their bodies face several problems. In order to change their bodies, they must have doctors who will help them make the changes. Sometimes, they can not do this because doctors will not help them. They may also not be able to do this because even if a doctor would treat them, they may not be able to afford the medicine or surgery. But the Declaration of Montreal says that such medical care should be given to them by public health insurance.\nDisease versus difference.\nSome people believe that being transgender is a disease, sometimes called gender identity disorder. Many transgender people do not like being labelled as having a disease, which they feel causes them to be seen and treated badly. Others believe that they should be labelled this way, because some governments and insurance companies will not pay for transgender people's medical treatment unless it is considered a disease. Also, In places that do not have laws that protect transgender people from discrimination, they may only be protected under laws that protect people with diseases or disabilities.\nDoctors do not agree on one way of viewing being transgender. Some doctors view it as a birth defect that can easily be fixed, others may not even think that being transgender is a medical condition. Since May 25th, 2019, the World Health Organization does not see being transgender as a disease or mental health problem, asking many countries to comply as well. One of the international human rights laws of the Yogyakarta Principles (Principal 18), disagrees with any use of a medical disease label.\nViolence.\nAbout 50% of transgender people have been sexually assaulted.\nLegal problems.\nTransgender people have problems with laws and regulations about sex. To be seen and treated as the sex they wish, transgender people usually have to change their first name. (Though some names are unisex, which means that they can be used by both men and women, transgender people with a unisex name may still want to change their name, though this is not always the case.) They also may want to change their identity documents to say the correct sex. For example, a transgender woman may wish to change her birth certificate or driving license to say her new female name and to say that she is a female.\nThese changes can protect transgender people from discrimination. For example, transgender people often have a hard time traveling because they may look like one sex but have another on their papers. These changes can also be needed for transgender people to be allowed to marry their spouses in places where it is illegal for people of the same sex to marry. These changes can even protect transgender people from a wide variety of violence. Some transgender people are only recognized when their documents reveal them. Being revealed as transgender can put people in danger because of transphobia (fear and/or hatred of transgender people).\nIn many places, it is hard or not possible for transgender people to change their legal sex, with or without having genital surgery, which is required in many places. This is against the Yogyakarta Principles. This is changing, however. The United Kingdom passed the Gender Recognition Act of 2004. This act allows people to have their change of sex officially recognized without surgery. Once changed, they legally become their new sex."}

It does not use a.m. or p.m. This system is also referred to (only in the US and the English speaking parts of Canada) as military time or (only in the United Kingdom and now very rarely) as continental time. In some parts of the world, it is called railway time. Also, the international standard notation of time (ISO 8601) is based on this format.\nA time in the 24-hour clock is written in the form hours:minutes (for example, 01:23), or hours:minutes:seconds (01:23:45). Numbers under 10 usually have a zero in front (called a leading zero); e.g. 09:07. Under the 24-hour clock system, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59 and ends at 24:00, which is identical to 00:00 of the following day. 12:00 can only be mid-day. Midnight is called 24:00 and is used to mean the end of the day and 00:00 is used to mean the beginning of the day. For example, you would say \"Tuesday at 24:00\" and \"Wednesday at 00:00\" to mean exactly the same time.\nHowever, the US military prefers not to say 24:00 - they do not like to have two names for the same thing, so they always say \"23:59\", which is one minute before midnight.\n24-hour clock time is used in computers, military, public safety, and transport. In many Asian, European and Latin American countries people use it to write the time. Many European people use it in speaking.\nMany digital wristwatches and clocks can display the time of day using the 24-hour clock.\nIn railway timetables 24:00 means the \"end\" of the day. For example, a train due to arrive at a station during the last minute of a day arrives at 24:00; but trains which depart during the first minute of the day go at 00:00.\nTo write shop opening hours until midnight use, for example, \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\".\nAdvantages over the 12-hour clock system:"}

The Ulster Volunteer Force was started as a Protestant/Unionist militia (citizen military force) in 1912 to oppose the Home Rule campaign for a separate Irish parliament. Many UVF members formed the 36th (Ulster) Division that fought with the British Army in World War I. The Progressive Unionist Party is the political wing of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando.

The war was fought in part because many people wanted Cuba, one of the last parts of the Spanish Empire, to become independent. Many Americans also wanted their country to get a colonial empire.\nSpain lost the sea war and so had to give up its colonies of Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and part of Guam. All of those colonies, except for Cuba, became US colonies after the war.\nCauses.\nFollowing reports of Spain abusing and killing Cubans, the US sent warships to Cuba. Spain was losing control of Cuba and had been putting Cubans into concentration camps. The US sent ships to Cuba to try to force Spain to give up Cuba. The USS \"Maine\" (ACR-1) exploded in Havana harbor, killing about 260 people on board. \"Remember the Maine\" became a common wartime saying. US newspapers blamed Spain for the explosion. Spain tried to avoid going to war, but pressure from US newspapers, called \"yellow journalism,\" and ordinary people, persuaded the US government to go to war. Some of them wanted Cuba to become independent, but others hoped that the US could build a colonial empire overseas, as many European countries had already done so.\nFighting.\nVolunteers throughout the country signed up for the war. Future US President Theodore Roosevelt raised troops and became famous in leading the Rough Riders during the Battle of San Juan Hill. \nIn a big naval battle in Manila Bay, an American fleet, commanded by George Dewey, destroyed the Spanish fleet. Ground battles took place in Cuba and Puerto Rico.\nThe US won the war and soon began to occupy and take control of the colonies after Spain surrendered. Almost 400 American soldiers died during fighting, but more than 4000 Americans died from diseases such as yellow fever, typhoid, and malaria.\nEnd of war.\nThe war stopped when the Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10, 1898 by the United States and Spain. The United States became the owners of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, Later, it got the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base."}

The disease is caused by the invading agents multiplying. As they multiply, they produce toxins and damage host tissues. Infectious disease, also known as 'transmissible disease' or 'communicable disease', is illness resulting from an infection.\nCommon infectious diseases.\nDiseases caused by many infectious agents.\nSome infections are caused by different infectious agents at different times. For example, some diarrhea is caused by bacteria. Some is caused by viruses.\nThis is a very short list. There are many more diseases from infection and other causes: common diseases.\nGetting infectious disease.\nSome diseases can be passed from one person to another easily. Other infectious diseases are harder to get. If a person kisses or touches another person who is infected with the flu, a cold, measles, or a sore throat, he or she may get their disease. They may also give the person their disease if they cough on them. Other medical conditions such as AIDS, herpes, and hepatitis B, are only passed by closer contact. Having sex with an infected person, blood transfusions, or touching their blood or urine can sometimes pass on these conditions or diseases.\nStopping infectious disease.\nPeople can stop disease by:\nTreating infectious disease.\nBacteria are usually treated with antibiotic medicines like Tetracycline and Penicillin. Viruses will not be killed by antibiotics. They must be treated with special medicines called antivirals. Medicines to treat HIV/AIDS like zidovudine are antivirals. Antifungals like miconazole and fluconazole treat infections from fungus. Anti-parasitic medicines like Praziquantel and mebendazole.\nSome infectious diseases have no treatments that work well. For example, there is no medicine that works well to cure West Nile Virus and Rabies. So it is important to avoid getting these diseases. Some infectious disease goes away on its own. These mild diseases do not need to be treated. For example, colds are caused by viruses and they do not need medicines.\nSome diseases can be prevented by immunizations. Immunizations try to make a person have an immune reaction to an infectious agent. This is usually done before the person gets the disease. Examples of diseases prevented by immunizations are: polio, tetanus, and pertussis. In some cases, if all of the disease can be removed from society, we can get rid of the disease completely. An example of this is smallpox. This virus used to kill people, cause blindness, and bad scars. Now there has not been a person who had smallpox in over thirty years."}

Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping.\nThe term fishing may be used for catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally used for catching farmed fish. With aquatic mammals, such as whales, the term whaling is better.\nAccording to FAO statistics, the total number of commercial fishermen and fish farmers is estimated to be 38 million. Fisheries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people in developing countries. In 2005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms, with 7.4 kilograms more got from fish farms. In addition to providing food, modern fishing is also a recreational sport.\nFishing for money.\nFishing for money is a very dangerous job, because people can die or be badly hurt.\u00a0Fishing gives a lot of food to many countries around the world, but those who take it as a job must often go far into the ocean under bad conditions. Commercial fishermen get many kinds of sea animals. This includes fish such as\u00a0tuna,\u00a0cod, and salmon, as well as invertebrates such as\u00a0shrimp,\u00a0lobster,\u00a0clams, and\u00a0squid. Alaskan king crab fishing is a famous example. Ways to fish for money have become very simple, using large nets and machines to catch the animals. Many countries have made rules limiting how much fish people can catch, because some kinds have become scarce.\nRaising fish in the forms of\u00a0aquaculture\u00a0and\u00a0mariculture\u00a0add to the free-range catch of fish.\nFishing for fun.\nSport fishing is normally done with a\u00a0fishing rod\u00a0and line with any number of hooks to get the fish. This method is called\u00a0\"angling\". There may be rules that say how many lines and hooks one fisherman can use and how many fish he can catch. Anglers in\u00a0fresh water\u00a0catch many\u00a0Black Bass\u00a0(Black Bass includes the entire range of Bass fish),\u00a0Pike,\u00a0Muskellunge,\u00a0Perch,\u00a0Carp,\u00a0Trout,\u00a0Salmon, and\u00a0Sunfish. Fish people get in saltwater include\u00a0Swordfish,\u00a0Marlin,\u00a0Tuna, and others. \nRules generally do not allow the use of nets and catching fish with hooks not in the mouth. However some kinds of fish can be taken with nets for bait and a few for food. Non-sport fish that are not said to be worth as much can sometimes be taken by many ways like\u00a0snagging,\u00a0bow and arrow, or even\u00a0gun, because they are seen as competing with more valuable fish.\nRecreational fishing laws also include other life that lives in water, such as\u00a0frogs\u00a0and\u00a0turtles.\nSport fishing\u00a0can be a contest where fishermen try to get more fish than other fishermen. This sport came from local fishing contests into a large contest in the U.S.A. where skilled fishermen can compete and be helped out by companies giving prize money, and other large contests around the world.\nCatch and release.\nCatch-and-release fishing is increasingly practiced especially by\u00a0fly fishermen, as well as spin and bait casting fishermen, to increase\u00a0conservation\u00a0and to protect rare fish such as marlin. The practice is however disputed as it by some is considered unethical to perform painful actions to the fish for fun and not for the reason of food production. Because of this, catch-and-release practice is illegal in\u00a0Norway.\nCollection of live fish.\nFish can also be collected in ways that do not injure them (such as in a\u00a0seine net), for observation and study or for keeping in\u00a0Aquarium. There is a substantial industry devoted to the collection, transport, export and farming of wild and domesticated live fish, usually freshwater or marine tropical fish.\nFishing with traps.\nFish can also be collected in ways that do not injure them (such as in a\u00a0seine net), for observation and study or for keeping in\u00a0Aquarium. There is a substantial industry devoted to the collection, transport, export and farming of wild and domesticated live fish, usually freshwater or marine tropical fish.\nToo much fishing.\nIn the past, fishing has been so good for getting money that people began\u00a0overfishing\u00a0(fishing too much) - a serious problem that does lots of damage (bad).\u00a0Overfishing does not always mean\u00a0extinction, but simply that a fish type has been harvested so that there cannot be as many of that kind of fish as before. As more boats are sent out to catch the fish, many\u00a0population\u00a0levels of a type of fish can drop.\u00a0Then, there are not enough of that kind of fish left to have new kinds of fish.\nMany times, fishing boats catch fish they do not mean to catch, called\u00a0\"bycatch\". All kinds of fish can become bycatch, and they are usually thrown back into the sea after they have died. Drift net fishing sometimes catches creatures like\u00a0seals,\u00a0dolphins,\u00a0whales, and\u00a0sea turtles. This kind of fishing made people complain. In the 1980s, it was guessed that 18 miles (30 km) of nets were lost every night, tangling up boats and animals.\nThere is now a floating pile of plastic in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles wide. Most of it is lost fishing nets, called ghost nets, and other fishing tools from large boats."}

It was established in 1861 by seven southern states in which slavery was legal, after Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the U.S., but before he took office. South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas declared their secession (independence) from the United States. After war began, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina joined them. The first capital of the Confederacy was Montgomery, Alabama, but for most of the war the capital was Richmond, Virginia.\nThe government of the Confederacy was much like the United States government. The Confederate States Constitution was similar to that of the United States; however, it emphasized states\u2019 rights and clearly protected the enslavement of black Americans. Jefferson Davis was chosen as president and Alexander Stephens as Vice-President. As in the United States, the CSA president had a cabinet of advisors.\nThe United States government (also known as the Union) did not agree that the states could leave and start a new government. Thus, the Union government refused to abandon all its forts in the states that wanted to secede. War began when the CSA attacked one of those forts, Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. This war is known as the American Civil War, and it lasted from 1861 to 1865. After some of the deadliest battles in U.S. history, Union forces gradually regained control of southern states. As Confederate forces surrendered, the Confederacy fell apart and the Civil War came to a close in 1865. Following the war, slavery was outlawed everywhere in the United States. The process of restoring the states of the CSA to the Union, called the Reconstruction of the United States, continued until 1877. \nIt is still undecided if the Confederate States of America was ever a country. The Union never said that the Confederacy was really a country. Although British and French companies sold ships and materials to the Confederacy, no nation officially recognized the CSA as an independent country.\nThe CSA was also called \"the South,\" \"the Confederacy,\" and \"Dixie.\""}

It is governed as a municipality and includes a large rural area. It is the biggest city in Vietnam. About 9 million people live in the city. \nThe city used to be called \"Saigon\", and this is still the most common name in everyday conversation. The name Saigon come from the Saigon River, which flows through the city. \nHistory.\nIt used to be a Khmer port city called Prey Nokor, or \u201cJungle City\u201d. The city was taken over by the Vietnamese and eventually took the name of\"(S\u00e0i G\u00f2n)\". It was invaded by the French in 1859. As (French) Saigon it was the capital of French Indochina and became an important city in French colonial trade. After independence(from France), in 1954 to 1975, Saigon became the capital of the Republic of Vietnam. After the end of the US campaign (1973) in the Vietnam War, Saigon was overtaken by the North Vietnamese army on 30 April 1975 and renamed after H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. The tradition of naming places in Vietnam after great people is very common. Many streets bear the names of epic heroes. Hai Ba Trung street is named after heroic sisters.\nDespite the name change, many people from other countries, and even among Vietnamese people, still call the city \"Saigon\" today. Interestingly enough, both the names of the Saigon River and the Saigon railway station have stayed unchanged.\nCity categorization.\nHo Chi Minh City (HCMC) has expanded with industrialization. It now includes all of the surrounding towns. The city center is old Saigon. Old Saigon has two main districts (One and Three). The new city districts used to be rice fields and fish farms. There are fish all over the city.\nGeography.\nHo Chi Minh City is as flat as the river plain it sits on. Nearly all roads are built flat. Bicycle riding around the Mekong delta is very easy in dry weather. Because of the flatness, roads and buildings sink into the draining soil. Lying water keeps pollution very close to city homes. The rising tides can flood many districts when the moon is fullest. \nBecause rainwater can't be kept in valleys or mountains, the city-water is dangerous to drink. Most people drink from large bottles of water - .\nWhen the streets flood (in rain or tides) the dirt from drains returns onto the city. This has caused a lot of problems for the health of the people living in the city. Escaping sewer water makes people very sick in the tropical countries. Older people may avoid drinking more than a few drinks a day.\nEnvironment.\nIt's very tropical in the city. The trees in streets are cut down to half every year - but they grow back. Fresh food markets are all over the city. The city has so much rain, that drains and rivers surround every district.\nThe southeast of the province has the . It's a 752 square kilometre mangrove area between Ho Chi Minh City and the sea.\nInside the wetlands there are birds, deer, fish, frogs, insects, lizards, monkeys, otters, and snakes. The centipedes all around the city are very dangerous (maybe deadly to tiny animals). People catch and consume the snakes.\nThe wetlands and ecosystem has been designated as a biosphere reserve. Ho Chi Minh people get education on how to look after their biosphere reserve and wetlands.\nPort.\nThe city is a river port on the Saigon River. Several larger terminals operate outside and inside of the city. Many small docks operate around the city. The river system leads out to sea at Vung Tau, or onto the Mekong delta.\nDelivery of materials for the city can be made by boat. Farm produce distributors can arrive by boat in many districts outside the city.\nEducation.\nThe use of English is rising in HCMC. Many HCMC people will travel around the world by using English as their international language. Many other languages are studied. French was previously the most popular. Chinese is also very well known to many people.\nInternational.\nThe city has international schools that teach foreign children. All classes (except for languages) are given in the chosen language. Many international schools have chosen English as the primary language. Some of the international schools are named by their country of origin. The schools named after a country use the national language of that country.\nNational.\nEnglish is a subject taught in all national schools.\nAfter-school and colleges.\nMany HCMC parents use to improve their children's English. HCMC adults attend colleges to learn English.\nGoing overseas.\nSome HCMC people will go overseas to get foreign education. It can be through staying with relatives, attending boarding schools, joining programs, or with family.\nUniversities.\nEnglish is taught at university in HCMC. It doesn't replace the national language at most universities. International universities might set a requirement for English or another language.\nPoverty.\nWealthy people live a fantastic life in the city. But, others are very poor. Poor does not always mean without food, clothing, shelter, or work in HCMC. The cost of living in Vietnam helps even the poorest people to survive. Many temples, churches, charities, and government organizations help people that are even more misfortunate than the poor. But still, some ultra-poor people struggle with homelessness, and the tropical weather - they get very dark skin compared to other people.\nEntertainment.\nThere is a lot of entertainment for the people in the city. Many discos, bars, and clubs operate all around the city. Food is also a source of entertainment for people in HCMC. Very strange restaurants sell very strange food: scorpions, bats, rats and more. Tourists are amazed by what is eaten in HCMC.\nNeighbors.\nThe Mekong River delta is accessible from HCMC. It has a many rice, coconut, fish, and prawn farms. The main city is Can Tho City.\nThe mountain range of Vietnam is accessed via Dalat City.\nThe beaches of Vietnam are accessed via Vung Tau City or Phan Thiet City when leaving HCMC.\nThe border to Cambodia is the closest international exit point for tourists. This exit border takes people to Phnom Penh City.\nBien Hoa City is another industrial city to the northeast. Around there, the province of Binh Duong is growing through strong financial investment."}

When most people say the word Torah they either mean the whole Jewish Bible, the Tanakh, the first five books of the Bible, or all of the Jewish teaching in general. These five books are the beginning of both the Jewish and Christian bibles. They are\nOther names for this set of books are the \"Five Books of Moses,\" or \"Pentateuch\".\nSome people may use the word Torah as a name for all the main Jewish teachings.\nEach of the books in the Torah are separated into parts called \"Parshiyot.\" \"Parsha\" is a Hebrew word meaning \"portion.\" Every Shabbat one \"parsha\" is read in the synagogue, but sometimes two are read. This is so that all the \"parshiyot\" are finished every year, on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah.\nIt is also known as the Five Book of Moses because Moses received these five books from God.\nPentateuch.\nPentateuch means the first five books of the Bible. These books are Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The word \"Pentateuch\" comes from two Greek words that mean \"five books\" or \"five scroll\"\nAccording to tradition, the books were written by the Israelite leader, Moses. The Pentateuch is often called the Five Books of Moses or the Torah.\nThe Pentateuch tells the story from the Creation of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelite's to enter the land of Canaan. The story is told in three parts. The first part (Genesis 1-11) is about the Creation and the beginning of human beings on earth. The second part (Genesis 12-50) are the stories of the ancestors of the Israelites, mainly Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The third part, beginning with the book of Exodus, describes how the Israelite's left Egypt and the early history of the people of Israel as a nation. It also has many laws about how the Israelite's must build their society. Deuteronomy is mostly Moses's final speech to his people and a summary of the Pentateuch."}

{"id": "10121", "revid": "212856", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10121", "title": "Rainforest", "text": "A rainforest is a forest that receives heavy rainfall. The most notable rainforests are in the tropics or subtropics, mostly in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The biggest rainforest is the Amazon rainforest, which is mostly in Brazil. Forests like this have extraordinary biodiversity. Biologists say over half of all plant and animal species live in the rainforest. Also more than 1/4 of all medicines come from here. Even though they only cover 6% of the Earth's land area they are still an important source of oxygen.\nThe rainforest gets an average of 50 to 250\u00a0inches (1.2-6.3m) of rain through the year. It is warm all year round, rarely getting above 34\u00b0C (94\u00a0\u00b0F) or getting below 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). It has an average humidity of 77 to 88%. Tropical rainforests occur in three major geographical areas around the world. These areas are:\nA less-used term is temperate rainforest. For temperate rain forests of North America, annual precipitation is over , and the mean annual temperature is between 4 and 12\u00a0\u00b0C (39 and 54\u00a0\u00b0F).\nHowever, definitions in other countries differ considerably. For example, Australian definitions are ecological-structural rather than climatic:\nThis definition would not suit the forests of western North America, and so the term \"temperate rainforest\" is not so widely agreed. The weather in a rainforest would be humid, which is wet but warm like a greenhouse. The bottom most layer receives 2% of the sunlight. Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. The understory layer lies between the canopy and forest floor. It is a home to a number of birds, snakes and lizards as well as predators such as jaguars and leopards. The leaves are much bigger at this level and insect life is abundant.\nCharacteristics.\nThe characteristics of the tropical rainforests are:\nThe five layers.\nTropical rainforests are typically dominated by different plants and animals at different levels. The top layer is the \"emergent\" layer. Then there is the \"canopy\" layer. Under the tall canopy is the \"understory\". The understory is made up of smaller trees, vines and shrubs. The next layer is called the shrub layer, and has mainly bushes. The bottom layer is the\" forest floor\". This is made up of the small plants on the ground.\nEmergent layer.\nThe emergent layer is the farthest from the ground. High in the trees eagles perch. Their keen eyes search constantly for small monkeys and other prey. Butterflies, parrots, toucans, and hundreds of other colourful birds constantly fly through the tops of the trees.\nCanopy layer.\nThe canopy is like a huge green roof over the forest. The trees grow up thin and straight, like pillars seeking the sun. They do not put out branches until they are very tall. Then, they spread out like an umbrella in the sunlight. The trees are so close together that very little light penetrates through to the lower layers. Many kinds of monkeys, birds, and insects live in the layer. The animals that call this layer home often never touch the ground throughout their entire lives. They find everything they need existing within the canopy. Water can be accessed from the boles of trees, if not, the leaves and epiphytes that grow in the canopy can supply that need. The animals eat the leaves and fruit of the trees, insects, or other animals. The tall canopy trees must be able to reach the sunlight high in the air and still get nutrients from the thin soil on the forest floor. Their roots do not go deep into the soil because there is nothing there for the plants to reach. Instead, the roots spread out in all directions along or just under the ground. That way they can quickly make use of the nutrients from the recycled plants and animals that have fallen to the floor.\nUnderstory layer.\nThe understory is usually a dark, humid place, under the canopy. There is very little light and no breeze because they are blocked out by the canopy. The plants under the canopy must be able to live with very little sunlight. Bushes, large green plants, and small trees make up this layer. Often they will only grow in open patches where a big tree has fallen down. Other plants, like vines, grow on the big trees.\nShrub Layer.\nThe shrub layer is mainly made out of bushes. It contains most of the rainforests orchids, because the orchids use water from the forest floor, vegetation from the understory and sunlight that is reflected from the canopy layer leaves. It is the smallest layer of the rainforest, yet contains over 84% of the rainforest's orchids. It is normally very dark in the shrub layer, apart from little spots of sunlight that comes through empty spaces of the emergent layer. Despite not having very much sunlight, the shrub layer is very humid [wet and warm]. Many insects live in the shrub layer such as scorpions, beetles and tarantulas. Many people categorize the rainforest into 4 layers not 5. They consider the shrub layer to be part of the understory.\nForest floor.\nThe ground level is called the forest floor. Snakes, Tapirs, Jaguars, Tamanduas, and Gorillas are just a few of the species that live here. It is dark on the rainforest floor. Insects, giant centipedes, spiders, ants, and beetles are also very abundant here. The floor of the rainforest is often very open and easy to walk across. That is because so little light reaches the floor that very few plants can grow there.\nPlants and animals.\nOne type of plant in the rainforest does not need soil. These plants are called \"epiphytes\", or air plants. Air plants live on the branches of trees in the canopy or understory, with their roots out in the air. In the humid rainforest, they collect water from the rain that falls on them.\nOne kind of air plant is a flower called an orchid. There are thousands of different kinds of orchids in the rainforest. Some air plants store water in pools in and around their roots. These pools can become homes for frogs and salamanders. Frogs usually need to lay their eggs in ponds, but some rainforest tree frogs lay their eggs in the pools in air plants. That way, the frogs never have to go down to the ground.Some plants are made for medicine for humans.\nMillions of kinds of insects live in the rainforest. It never gets cold enough to kill them. There are bees, butterflies, termites, beetles, and many kinds of flies. There are ants everywhere. One kind of ant is the army ant. Army ants do not have nests. They march out in a line every day to hunt for other insects, which they eat. At night they hook themselves together to form a living nest around their queen and larvae, or baby ants.\nSnakes live in the trees and on the forest floor. They eat frogs, eggs, birds, insects, and small animals. Some of the snakes, like the fer-de-lance of Latin America, are poisonous, but others are not. One large non-poisonous snake is the anaconda of South America. It is one of the largest snakes in the world. It kills its prey by wrapping itself around the animal and squeezing it until it cannot breathe.\nMonkeys are a very common animal in the rainforest. Most live their lives up in the canopy and the understory. They have long arms to swing from branch to branch, and some use their tails to hold onto the trees while they eat. They are fast and agile, jumping easily from tree to tree for food. Different monkeys eat different things. They can eat nuts, flowers, roots, and frogs. Their hoots and howls are heard throughout the rainforest, even when they cannot be seen among the trees.\nMany colorful birds also live among the canopy of the rain forest, and there are also animals that live on the forest floor. The tapir is a forest animal that looks like a large pig. It is actually related to the horse and the rhinoceros. They live in South American and Asian rain forests, eating leaves, twigs, and fruit. Tapirs are among the animals hunted by the big cats of the rain forest. Jaguars, leopards, and tigers are the largest predators of rain forests. These cats have beautiful fur coats that have been hunted for the fur trade for years. The spotted coats of the jaguar and leopards were especially popular for fur coats. Today most countries are trying to protect their big cats, but many are still hunted illegally.\nThese are only a few of the animals and plants in the rainforest. About half of all of the different kinds, or species, of plants and animals in the entire world live in rain forests. Many of the plants and animals, especially insects, do not even have scientific names, because they have never been classified by a biologist.\nPeople of the rainforest.\nThere are many tribes of people who have lived in the rainforests for thousands of years. These forest dwellers usually belong to one of two groups. They are usually hunter/gatherers or slash-and-burn farmers.\nHunter/gatherers.\nHunter/gatherers live as they do in every other region of the world. They kill animals and gather what the forest provides for part of their food. Unlike in the Arctic, tools are always available. Unlike in the desert, water is always available. The people do not need clothes to protect them from the weather. The forest even provides a way to make hunting easier. Many of the people hunt with poisoned arrows. The poisons come from the plants of the forest. That makes the animals easier to kill.\nSlash-and-burn farmers.\nMost of the forest people are slash-and-burn farmers. They raise crops in small clearings as well as hunting and gathering in the forest. This provides them with food year-round. They start by cutting (slashing) down the trees and the other plants in an area. They let the dead plants dry out, then they burn them. The ash from the burned plants goes into the soil and makes it fertile for a little while. This is called slash-and-burn farming.\nThe small clearings grow food crops for a few years, then the family or group moves on and clears a new field. The old field is left to be overgrown by the forest. In a few years, it once again looks like the rain forest that surrounds it.\nThis type of farming does not harm the rain forest when only a few people are doing it. The small clearings become rain forest again without any damage. The land is used and recycled for use again some other time. The rain forest easily regrows to fill in the clearings after the people leave. That is changing today. Today, the rain forests are getting smaller because too many people are burning them.\nRainforests in danger.\nThere are some serious problems concerning the rainforests that need to be fixed. Rainforests are being cut down too quickly. Every year an area about the size of West Virginia is being destroyed. This is a problem for everyone.\nRainforests are so large and thick that for many years very few people lived or went there. Today, however, that is changing. Millions of poor, often hungry, people live near the rainforests of the world. These people are desperate for a better life, and they think they can find it in the forests.\nSettlers can get into the rainforests because modern machines have opened roads deep into the jungle. The roads are usually built by businesses who want to cut down trees or dig up minerals in the forest. Governments build other roads for trade and to allow settlers into the forest. Poor people come into the forest by the thousands on the roads and take land to raise food. They burn off the trees and plants to make a field. Then they plant crops for food and to sell. All around them other farmers do the same, so there is no forest left to grow back.\nThe new farms can only grow crops for a few years in the poor soil. The farmers then sell the land to a cattle rancher or just leave and clear a new piece of land. The soil is so poor that it will not even grow grass to feed cattle for more than a few more years. By then, the ground is hard packed and grows only a few weeds. The rainforest is destroyed and nothing can be done with the land.\nIf this continues long enough, the forests will be destroyed and the farmers will have no place to move. Then those people will \n, because there will be no land left where they can grow food. Forcing them to stop cutting down the forest will not help, because they would just starve now instead of later. New ways need to be found for these people to live on the rainforest land without destroying it.\nAlso, no one knows how destroying the rainforests will change the earth. We know that less rain will fall once the trees are gone. That may cause some rivers, which supply water to cities around the rainforest, to dry up during part of the year. Also, burning trees puts carbon into the air. Carbon absorbs heat from the sun. Will the burning of so many trees change the air and make the climate on the earth warmer? Experts are arguing about it, but it might be happening.\nThe rainforests are also the source of many things that are useful to human beings. As many as one out of every four drugs bought at the store were discovered in rainforest. Coffee, chocolate, bananas, corn, tea, sweet potatoes, Brazil nuts, rubber, and tapioca all came from the rainforest. Very valuable wood is taken from the trees of the rainforest. Mahogany, teak, and balsa wood come from there. Those trees can not be grown without the thick, wet, warm rainforests. Thus, the loss of the rainforests would hurt other people besides those that must live there.\nTropical rainforests are located in a band around the equator (Zero degrees latitude), mostly in the area between the Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u00b0 N latitude) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5\u00b0 S latitude). This 3,000\u00a0mile (4800\u00a0km) wide band is called the \"tropics.\""}

In Welsh, it is known as \"Cymraeg\", or \"yr iaith Gymraeg\", which means \"the Welsh language\". \nWelsh is still spoken throughout the region: around 21% of the people of Wales (about 600,000 people), as well as some people outside Wales, including those in nearby England, can speak Welsh. Many people in Wales say they can understand some form of Welsh, such as spoken, written, or can read Welsh, even if they do not speak it all the time.\nEven though almost all Welsh people can understand and use the English language, the Welsh language is still an important part of Welsh culture and so children in all schools in Wales have to study it. There are some schools that have almost all of their classes in Welsh, but most schools teach mainly in English and Welsh is taught as a second language in these schools.\nLanguage mutations.\nWelsh has mutations. Mutations are when a sound (in speech) or a letter (in writing) changes at the start of a word. An example is the Welsh word \"gwneud\", which in English means \"to do\", and \"dod\", which means \"to come\" \"dewch i mewn\" which means \"come in\". Sometimes the word changes from \"\"gwneud\" to \"wneud\", and from \"dod\" to \"ddod\"\". These sounds (in speech) or letters (in writing) changes also occur within, and at the end, of words, although the simplified classification found in ordinary books does not mention this.\nFormal and informal Welsh.\nIn Welsh, there is formal and informal Welsh. Formal Welsh is used when writing, in formal documents, and when speaking to a group (because it also includes the plural), when speaking to someone older than yourself, speaking to someone you have just met, or someone you would like to show respect towards. Formal words and phrases use variations of \"chi\", meaning \"you.\" Sometimes, people will ask you to call them \"chi.\"\nInformal Welsh is used when sending e-mails or sending text messages to your friends or family, and when talking with people you have known for a long time. Informal words and phrases use variations of \"ti\", meaning \"you.\" Sometimes, people will ask you to call them \"ti.\"\nHow to say things in Welsh.\nThere are some sounds and letters that exist in Welsh but not in English, such as the letters (and sounds) ch and ll. The first sound is pronounced like the Scottish \"Loch Ness\", and an example Welsh word that uses the 'ch' is \"bach\", which means \"small.\" \"Ll\" is a voiceless 'l,' and is made by placing the tongue on the top of the top gum, and blowing. A Welsh word that uses the 'll' is \"llan\", which means \"church\" and appears a lot in place names, including one called \"Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\". Both 'ch' and 'll' are single letters in the Welsh alphabet, along with 'dd,' 'ff,' 'ng,' 'ph,' 'rh,' and 'th.'\nHere are some things to say in Welsh. How to say it is in brackets ().\nHere are a few other words;\nThe media.\nWelsh books and newspapers have been printed for hundreds of years. Some of these books have been translated into English, and some books in other languages have been translated into Welsh. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was translated into Welsh, with the translation of \"Harri Potter a Maen yr Athronydd\", which means the same as the English title.\nBBC Radio Cymru is a Welsh-language radio station that is available throughout Wales. Some local radio stations have some Welsh and English programs during the day.\nThe Welsh television channel, S4C, has been on air since 1982. It broadcasts shows such as the soap opera Pobol y Cwm, and children's programs such as Superted and Sam T\u00e2n (known as Fireman Sam in English).\nIn August 2009, the mobile phone maker Samsung (with provider Orange) unveiled a new Welsh language mobile phone would be available from September 2009. It includes Welsh language predictive text and menus.\nThe Welsh alphabet.\nThe Welsh alphabet has some extra letters that are not used in English, and does not have some others. Although certain letters do not exist in Welsh, they are used sometimes to make sounds that could not possibly be made otherwise. A good example is the word \"garej\" (meaning \"garage\"). The letter \"j\" does not exist in the Welsh language, and is a lend-word from English. The traditional word for \"garage\" in Welsh is \"modurdy\", which means, \"motor house\". Another lend-word is \"\"toiled\",\" which means \"toilet\" in English. There are now many lend-words in spoken Welsh. Here is the Welsh alphabet;\nA\"1\", B, C, CH\"2\", D, DD\"2\", E\"1\", F\"2\", FF\"2\", G, NG\"2\", H, I\"1\", L, LL\"2\", M, N, O\"1\", P, PH\"2\", R, RH\"2\", S, T, TH\"2\", U\"1\", W\"1\" \"2\", Y1.\n\"1\" These letters are vowels. The letter 'W' can be used either as a vowel (when it is said 'oo' like in the Welsh word 'cwm' (coom) meaning 'valley') or as a consonant (when it is said like it is in English, for example in the Welsh word 'gwyn' (gwin) meaning 'white'). This is the same with letter 'I' which can also be used as a consonant (when it is said like an English Y like in 'iogwrt' (yog-oort) meaning yoghurt. \n&lt;br&gt;\"2\" Letters that are not in the English alphabet, or have different sounds. CH sounds like the 'KH' in Ayatollah Khoumeini. DD is said like the TH in 'there'. F is said like the English 'V'. FF is said like the English 'F'. NG sounds like it would in English but it is tricky because it comes at the beginnings of words (for example 'fy ngardd' - my garden). One trick is to blend it in with the word before it. LL sounds like a cat hissing. PH sounds like the English 'F' too, but it is only used in mutations. RH sounds like an 'R' said very quickly before a 'H'. TH sounds like the 'TH' in 'THin'. W has been explained in the sentences before about vowels."}

The word Thai (\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22) comes from the ethnic group in the center of Thailand. \nThailand is a constitutional monarchy. It has a King as a head of state, who is Vajiralongkorn at the moment.\nMost people here (95%) follow the philosophy called Buddhism.

It is by the Hudson River in Hudson County, across from Manhattan. In 2010, 50,005 people lived there.\nGeography.\nHoboken is at 40\u00b044'41\" North, 74\u00b01'59\" West (40.744851, -74.032941).\nThe United States Census Bureau said the city has a total area of 5.1 km\u00b2 (2.0 mi\u00b2). 3.3\u00a0km\u00b2 (1.3\u00a0mi\u00b2) of it is land and 1.8\u00a0km\u00b2 (0.7\u00a0mi\u00b2) of it is water. The total area is 35.35% water.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nHoboken was originally an island. The Hudson River was to the east. To the west was a swamp near the Palisades Sill. The island was a campsite used by the Lenni Lenape. The name Hoboken comes from the original Lenape name for \"Hobocan Hackingh\" or \"land of the tobacco pipe.\" Europeans came in the 17th century.\nThe first European to find Hoboken was Henry Hudson. He stopped his ship near Weehawken Cove on October 2, 1609. Three Native Americans sold Hoboken to Michael Paauw, Director of the Dutch West India Company on July 12, 1630. The first European settlers of Hoboken were Dutch farmers. Hendrick Van Vorst of Jersey City leased the land to Aert Van Putten, who was Hoboken's first person. In 1643 Van Putten built a farm house and brew house north of Castle Point. The brew house was America's first.\nThe land was taken by William Bayard. Bayard liked the revolutionary cause but changed to a Loyalist Tory in 1776 when the Rebels lost the New York and New Jersey Campaign. At the end of the Revolutionary War, Bayard's land was taken by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey.\nThe nineteenth century.\nAfter the American war for independence, Hoboken was bought by Colonel John Stevens in 1784 for about $90,000. In the early 19th century, Stevens made the waterfront better for Manhattan people. He tested his inventions. Later in the century, Hoboken became better by being a shipping port and industrial center. Hoboken became a city in 1855, and Cornelius V. Clickener became the first Mayor. By the 19th century, shipping lines were using Hoboken as a port, and the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad (later the Erie Lackawanna Railroad) had became a railroad center at the waterfront. \nIn 1832, a cave called Sybil's Cave opened and was popular. At that time, Hoboken was not yet an industrial city, and Hoboken was a country spot. Sybil's Cave was used in one of Edgar Allan Poe's stories in 1841. The water in the cave was bad, so the cave closed in the 1880s. In the 1930s it was filled with stone but in 2005 it was reopened.\nHoboken grew. People got many jobs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, started by Colonel Stevens in 1838, created many streets, began housing, and created building sites. The housing was made up of masonry of three to five stories. Many buildings survive to the present day, and the street grid. It was also at this time that German immigrants became the main group in Hoboken. Along with the main industry of creating ships, well-known industries that created a big presence in Hoboken were Maxwell House, Lipton Tea, and Hostess, among others. In 1870, the Stevens Institute of Technology was created at Castle Point, the highest point in Hoboken.\n\"Heaven, Hell or Hoboken.\".\nWorld War I changed Hoboken. People against Germans started the city being placed under law, and many Germans had to move to Ellis Island in nearby New York Harbor. Or they left the city. During the war Hoboken became famous. In Hoboken terminal, American troops got onto ships that went to Europe. More than three million soldiers went through the terminal, and their word phrase was \"Heaven, Hell or Hoboken... by Christmas.\"\nInterwar years.\nAfter the war, Italians were the city's major group, with the Irish having been a big group.\nPost World War II.\nIn the 1960s, other people followed, including Puerto Ricans. High crime rates shortly followed, and many of Hoboken's original residents slowly moved out, including Irish and Italians. In the middle of the 20th century, industries looked for greener areas, port jobs went to larger places in Newark Bay, and the car, truck and airplane relpaced the railroad and ship as the way of moving in the United States. Most of the ports closed around 1975.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, and commuters who were going into Manhattan for work. Making Hoboken better was done in the same way as in the Manhattan. Making Hoboken better has continued, with many new places to live now being built on what used to be industrial sites on the waterfront and even more so in the western parts of Hoboken that were wost for the longest time. Although political control of the city is largely influenced by the city's long-term residents, the \"yuppies\" who have settled in Hoboken are now showing extensive interest. The City of Hoboken is controlled by the Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council).\nDemographics.\n\"Notice: This section of reading material may be too difficult to read.\"\nAs of the census of 2000, there are 38,577 people, 19,418 households, and 6,835 families residing in the city. The population density is 11,636.5/km\u00b2 (30,239.2/mi\u00b2). There are 19,915 housing units at an average density of 6,007.2/km\u00b2 (15,610.7/mi\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city is 80.82% White, 4.26% African American, 0.16% Native American, 4.31% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 7.63% from other races, and 2.78% from two or more races. 20.18% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere are 19,418 households out of which 11.4% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.8% are married couples living together, 9.0% have a female householder with no husband present, and 64.8% are non-families. 41.8% of all households are made up of individuals and 8.0% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 1.92 and the average family size is 2.73.\nIn the city the population is spread out with 10.5% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 51.7% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 30 years. For every 100 females there are 103.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 103.9 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city is $62,550, and the median income for a family is $67,500. Males have a median income of $54,870 versus $46,826 for females. The per capita income for the city is $43,195. 11.0% of the population and 10.0% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 23.6% of those under the age of 18 and 20.7% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.\nCharacter.\nWith containerization in the 20th century Hoboken lost business as a port town and became rundown. Paterson, Elizabeth, and Camden were other places in New Jersey with similar problems. In the late 1970s, it began to prosper again and many people wanted to live there. \nThe city today is known for its excellent views of Manhattan, its fine-grained street grid, its historic architecture, and its restaurants and bars. A car is more of a hindrance than a help in getting around, and people do a great amount of walking. On weekend nights the town swells with young partygoers from nearby New Jersey towns who practice a rowdier style of barhopping than is fashionable across the river in Manhattan. Sundays are quieter.\nHoboken's gentrification has become relatively advanced, though many native residents remain in the city and hold political power. The population of \"newcomers\" or \"yuppies\", as they are typically called in the local press, consists of college and post-graduate students, bi-nationals, older artists and, increasingly, well-to-do commuters to Manhattan. However, rising rents and other costs of living, particularly in rental units, has resulted in some of the \"bohemian\" population moving away.\nWaterfront.\nThe Hoboken waterfront is the western shore of the Hudson from Newark Street and the Holland Tunnel to the south, and the Stevens Institute of Technology and Lincoln Tunnel to the north. The waterfront defined Hoboken as a port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th century to the outbreak of World War I when the federal government took control for war purposes. Control of the waterfront was returned to the city in the early 1950s. \"On the Waterfront\", often listed among the five or ten best American films ever, was filmed here. It dramatized the lives of dockworkers, and the infiltration of unions by organized crime. Today the waterfront is a place to look at the Hudson River and Manhattan, with landscaped parks built on the foundations of former piers (Pier A, Pier C, Sinatra Park and Pier 14)."}

It can be harmful for both humans and animals if a large amount is consumed. If a person ate 10-13 grams of caffeine quickly, between 80-100 cups of coffee, it would kill them.\nSource.\nCaffeine is the main drug that is in coffee. Coffee comes from a tree. The seeds of the tree are roasted to make coffee.\nCaffeine comes from other plants as well. It is in guarana, yerba mat\u00e9, cacao, and some plants used to make tea. The plants use caffeine as a \"pesticide\". This is a chemical that kills insects if they eat the plant. It is the way the plant protects itself.\nCaffeine was first extracted from cocoa beans into its purest form which is a white powder and the word originated from the German word \u201ckaffee\u201d and the French word \u201ccaf\u00e9\u201d which both mean caffeine.\nIt is called guaranine when it comes from the guarana plant and theine when it comes from a tea plant. It is called mateine in the mate drink. This drink is an infusion made with Yerba mate.\nWhat caffeine is.\nCaffeine is a \"stimulant\" drug. A stimulant is a drug that increases body actions like heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. It makes a person more awake and alert.\nCaffeine also is a diuretic. This means it makes a person make more urine (the waste liquid a person makes).\nThe caffeine chemical is called a \"xanthine alkaloid\". This is a group of chemicals that are stimulants. Some xanthine alkaloids (like theophylline) are used to help asthma.\nWhat caffeine is used for.\nThe biggest use of caffeine is as a stimulant. People drink coffee and other drinks with caffeine to stay awake.\nDoctors sometimes use caffeine as a medicine. It is used for headaches (head pain). It is sometimes used to help premature (born \"very\" early) babies to breathe. The short-term risk of this treatment seems to be that the babies treated gain less weight than usual.\nCaffeine is sometimes given to people after a lumbar puncture. This is a test to see if someone has meningitis.\nIn the beginning caffeine was found to relieve hunger, so it was used for weight loss. That did not last because people were using too much. Caffeine can be a very dangerous drug when not used in the right way.\nCaffeine also has medicinal properties. It is used in many over the counter medicines, such as Excedrin, Midol and Anacin. When combined with other analgesics, caffeine can help to alleviate headaches and cramps.\nProblems with caffeine.\nThe largest problem with caffeine is addiction. This is when people get bad symptoms when they do not have the drug. When people have \"withdrawal\" (feel bad because they do not have the drug) they drink more. This makes them feel better. But if they cannot get more, they are likely to feel some of the symptoms listed below:\nCaffeine can also hurt people if they drink a lot at once. If someone takes too much of a drug at once it is called an \"overdose\". Caffeine overdose is a medical diagnosis. It is called: \"Caffeine-Induced Organic Mental Disorder\" or \"Caffeine Intoxication\". People with this can have these symptoms:\nCaffeine helps for.\nCaffeine also has some strong advantages:\nHow much caffeine is safe.\n250\u2013300\u00a0mg of caffeine a day is a \"moderate\" amount. That is as much caffeine that is in three cups of coffee (8oz each cup). More than 750\u20131000\u00a0mg a day is a significant amount, but is very unlikely to kill someone. The Lethal Dose 50 of caffeine is 192\u00a0mg per kilogram, in rats. In humans, it is between 150 and 200\u00a0mg per kilogram (70-90 per pound.)\nCaffeine is in many drinks and foods. This is \"approximate\" amounts of caffeine in some food and drink:\nOne ounce \u2013 abbreviated oz - is 30ml.\nA 'cup' is 8 oz (240ml.)"}

He was born in Virginia and grew up in Georgia. In 1917, after the U.S. had been neutral, it got involved with the First World War. Because of Wilson, the League of Nations was founded. Therefore, he received the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1919. Between 1890 and 1902, Wilson worked as professor for law at Princeton University.\nHe was one of the initiators of the League of Nations, the creation of which he strongly supported.\nLife.\nWoodrow Wilson, son of Joseph Ruggles Wilson and Janet \"Jessie\" Woodrow Wilson, was born in Staunton, Virginia, United States. Wilson's father was a Presbyterian minister. Wilson had one brother and two sisters. He studied from 1875 to 1879 at the University of Princeton in New Jersey. Between 1879 and 1883, Wilson studied law at the University of Virginia. In 1885, he did a doctorate at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. His dissertation was about the \"Congressional Government\". In the same year, Wilson was married to Ellen Louise Axson.\nWilson started to teach political science at Princeton University in 1886. He became the director of Princeton University in 1902. Wilson kept in this position until 1910. Wilson's goal was to change the pedagogical system, the social system and the style of the campus. \nPolitical career.\nHe was elected to be the Governor of New Jersey for the Democratic Party in 1911. On November 4, 1912, Wilson became the 28th President of the United States. He won with 42% against the incumbent president William Howard Taft. His time being president started in March 1913.\nWilson mostly handled domestic matters during his first term. He passed laws to prevent monopolies from forming, started a few business regulations, passed laws protecting workers, and created the Federal Reserve. During his second term, he also helped women gain the right to vote.\nIn 1914, his wife Ellen died of Bright's Disease. His doctor, Cary Grayson, introduced him to a girl named Edith Galt, whose husband was also dead. After two months they fell in love and got married. For a long time he focused on her instead of his job as President. But soon, he got back to work.\nIn 1917, Wilson entered the country in World War One. America was previously neutral, but German submarines kept sinking American ships sailing in British waters and even tried to encourage Mexico to invade the United States, which was the final straw for Wilson. World War One was a war between the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Allied Powers (England, France, and Italy). America was on the Allies' side. The Allies won the war a year later. \nWilson took a ship to Europe to talk with the leaders of the other Allies about what to do with Germany. They came up with the Treaty of Versailles. A part of the Treaty of Versailles said that there will be a group of countries called the League of Nations. A lot of people in America did not like the League of Nations because they thought that it was none of America's business to mess with other countries' problems. \nWilson's political enemy, Senator Henry Lodge from Massachusetts, made a different version of the Treaty of Versailles. Even though Wilson was very sick, he traveled around the country asking people to like the Treaty and the League. Wilson ended up having a stroke. It was the first time he had one. It was very bad and Wilson was not able to run the country as best he could. His thinking also was not great because of the stroke. But, he stayed President and told Congress not to vote for Henry Lodge's new treaty. Congress listened but also said no to Wilson's treaty.\nWilson received criticism for many of his decisions. Theodore Roosevelt criticized him for entering the war too late. \nWilson nationalized private industries such as the telegraph, telephone, railroad, and prices rose exponentially. As prices began to rise, a recession set in and racial riots began leading to 150 deaths. His inability to subside racial struggles and the creation of the federal reserve make him one of the most consequential presidents of all time."}

{"id": "10200", "revid": "827189", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10200", "title": "The Monkees", "text": "The Monkees were an American pop-rock band. The band was created originally for a comedy television series of the same name which aired on NBC, from 1966 to 1968. The members of the group were Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and Micky Dolenz. They had hits with \"Last Train to Clarksville\", \"I'm a Believer\", and \"Daydream Believer\". Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart were songwriters and producers who worked with the Monkees. Another writer/producer for the Monkees was Chip Douglas. Many of the songs recorded by the Monkees came from the Brill Building writers in New York City.\nThe members.\nFour actors with musical skills were chosen, out of 437 hopefuls who auditioned for the series. Britisher Davy Jones was under contract to Columbia Pictures, had issued records, and performed on British and American television. Columbia was looking for a project for Jones, and Screen Gems, who would produce the show, was their TV division. Nesmith was from Texas, played in country and rock bands, and had published his own songs. Dolenz was a grown-up from Los Angeles, California, who sang and played in cover bands. Tork had been a working folk musician in New York's Greenwich Village. Each had their own wit and personality, could entertain an audience, and could also sing.\nOther young men who auditioned for the show included Stephen Stills (who showed great talent, but looked too old for a role; he referred Tork, an old friend who looked a little like him), Danny Hutton (who later found fame with Three Dog Night), Harry Nilsson (who later met the Monkees, wrote for them, and recorded with them), and Paul Williams (who had lost a role in \"Circus Boy\" to Dolenz ten years earlier; the Monkees later recorded his song \"Someday Man\"). Charles Manson was later rumored to have auditioned, but he was imprisoned at the time.\nThe concept.\nBob Rafelson and Bert Schneider wanted to make movies, but had little experience in that. Schneider's father was president of Columbia Pictures, and offered them the chance to make a for a television series. If the series was sold to a network, they could produce and direct , and gain experience.\nRafelson had already wanted to produce something involving musicians, and their life. When the Beatles appeared in the movies \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help!\", people enjoyed watching them onscreen, both playing out their lives and performing comedy, along with playing music. Rafelson and Schneider adapted what they saw in the Beatles movies, and also in American movies and television. While the Beatles were always shown as a popular, well-known band, their show would be about an unknown band, looking for the chance to become famous.\nThe pilot episode was filmed in the fall of 1965. A first playing for a test audience did not score well, but a re-edited version scored very well, and the series was sold to NBC. To make sure there was enough music for the series, Don Kirshner was hired. His Brill Building songwriters were among the best young talent.\nActor James Frawley, the son of William Frawley (from \"I Love Lucy\" fame), wanted to become a movie director. He worked with Rafelson and Schneider, then with the Monkees as they were selected. Before the series began filming, Frawley spent six weeks working with the members, teaching them about in acting and comedy, and helping them learn to play characters.\nThe series.\n\"The Monkees\" appeared for two seasons on NBC television, with 58 episodes made in all. The show won two Emmy Awards in 1967, for Outstanding Comedy Series, and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy. The series gave promotion to the Monkees's records, while their music made people interested in watching the show. While the show's natural audience was children and teenagers, there were also jokes and other things that older viewers could enjoy. The band sometimes talked directly to the audience, and made fun of the fact that they were on a television show. Many episodes ended with short interviews with the Monkees, where they talked about their careers and things that were important to them. This made their fans feel like they knew the members of the band.\nEach episode featured two songs. One was normally a single side, and the other was a new song. The band lip-synched to recordings on camera, and also filmed unrelated scenes, in random places with whatever objects were there. These were edited together and called \"romps\". The romps looked much like music videos.\nThe music.\nA large problem the Monkees faced was that none of them could play a musical instrument, because the music on their first records was mostly made by studio musicians. Nesmith and Dolenz played guitar, and Dolenz took drum lessons, so he could play drums on camera. Tork played guitar, keyboards and banjo. Jones learned to play drums and guitar, and a custom bass guitar was made specially for him. He also played percussion instruments, like tambourine.\nThe band had little experience playing together though, and were not able to make the music needed to begin the show. The producers planned at first to use prerecorded music, and went ahead with that plan. Don Kirshner had good for knowing what would sell well, and took charge of the recordings, limiting the input the Monkees themselves had in making the music. For most of the first season's songs, the members only sang, and did not play on the records. Boyce and Hart also noticed that when all four Monkees were together in the studio, they would try to make each other laugh during takes, and things did not get done. They began bringing the band to record in ones and twos. Kirshner also okayed Nesmith to produce two of his own songs, for each Monkees album. Nesmith could choose musicians and sing, but could not play on the records himself.\nIn time, the band improved musically, and wanted another chance to play on their own recordings. They also began to perform live for audiences. Kirshner would not change his mind, issued a whole album without even telling the band, and planned to issue a new single. Nesmith argued with Kirshner and his attorney (putting his own fist through a wall to show his anger), and called a , telling the media about his unhappiness with how the music was made. Many people thought this proved the Monkees were , and did not deserve to be popular. To prove themselves, the Monkees recorded a new single, then a new album, with each member playing instruments. Their new records did not sell as well as their first ones, but they felt better knowing the music was really theirs, and they still had hit records.\nKirshner issued the single \"A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\" (written by Neil Diamond), without getting an OK first. This was reason enough to fire him from the Monkees production team. Kirshner's career was not harmed, and he went on to produce other music his way, including songs for The Archies. He later hosted a show, \"Don Kirshner's Rock Concert\", which featured bands in a live setting.\nEnd of the series.\nThe Monkees became tired of the same \"formula\" used in episode after episode of the series (Davy Jones would fall in love with a girl, and the rest of the band would help him get together with her), and wanted to try doing a variety show instead. NBC and the show's producers did not want to change the way the show was done. The two sides could not agree, and the show was cancelled, even though it was still popular.\nAfter the television series ended, the Monkees starred in a movie, \"Head\", and a TV special, \"33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee\". Neither was successful, and the band's later records were not hits. The Monkees kept performing for audiences, but fewer and fewer people went to their shows. The band members each quit one by one. Tork left at the end of 1968, saying he was . Nesmith left in 1970, to start his own band. Jones left during 1970, and went back to performing solo.\n\"The Monkees\" appeared in reruns on CBS from 1969 to 1972, first during lunchtimes and later alongside Saturday morning cartoons. ABC later aired the series, from 1972 to 1973.\nThe 1970s.\nEach former Monkee tried different things during the next decade. Tork worked as a musician, teacher and singing waiter. Nesmith pursued a country music career, then began to make videos. Jones and Dolenz both sang on records. Jones did more theater work, while Dolenz made cartoon .\nDolenz and Jones teamed up with Boyce and Hart in 1976, to tour and perform the Monkees' old hits. They also made a new album together. Later Jones and Dolenz went to England, to appear in a production of Harry Nilsson's \"The Point!\" Both stayed in England. Jones appeared in \"Godspell\" and other musical plays, and retrained as a jockey. Dolenz became a television director and producer. During these same years, Nesmith started his own company, to produce music and videos. Tork went back to performing and sometimes making records.\n\"The Monkees\" appeared in from 1975 on, usually playing on local television stations during afternoons. A compilation album, \"The Monkees Greatest Hits\", was issued, and their old hits still played on radio stations. A second \"Greatest Hits\" album appeared later.\nThe 1980s and later.\nIn 1986, Tork, Jones and Dolenz reunited, as part of an \"oldies show\" tour. MTV aired nearly every episode of their old series one Sunday, to promote the tour, and it became a surprise hit. Twenty years after they started, a new generation of young people were interested in the Monkees. The tour went from a small one to a major one, and the Monkees were back. MTV and the Monkees worked well together. Nickelodeon, a sister network to MTV, aired their series, and the band appeared on Nickelodeon and MTV during the late 1980s. Nesmith mostly did not join the reunion, because of his production career, but he did make a few rare appearances with them. The other members also kept their solo careers, between tours.\nDuring the 1990s, the reunited Monkees continued to tour, and appear as guests on television. Nesmith rejoined them for a new album, \"Justus\", a TV special, and he appeared with them onstage in England. He left when they began to tour the United States, though, and did not return. After 2000, they toured less often. Tork left again in 2001, and Jones and Dolenz last worked together in 2002.\nEvery episode of the TV series is for sale on DVD (as is their movie \"Head\"), and all their record releases are for sale on compact disc. Rhino Records bought the rights to all their works, and still oversees Monkees releases.\nDolenz, Tork and Jones toured the UK and USA throughout 2011.

The band members were: Mick Jagger (rhythm guitar and vocals), Keith Richards (lead and rhythm guitar and vocals), Brian Jones (lead guitar), Bill Wyman (bass guitar), and Charlie Watts (drums). The band were influenced by American blues and rock musicians like Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Muddy Waters. In the beginning they had their first hits with covers versions of songs of those artists. Along with the Beatles and the Kinks, they helped to lead the British Invasion of the early to mid 1960s.\nTheir fame rose quickly in 1965 with the song \"The Last Time.\" The song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" became a world-wide hit for the band. It was followed up by songs like \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" and \"Paint It Black\". In the 1967 they experimented with a psychedelic music style. But in 1968 they went back to a harder rock style with songs like \"Sympathy for the Devil\" and \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" and \"Honky Tonk Women.\"\nIn 1969, Brian Jones was fired from the band due to his growing drug addictions. A few weeks later Jones was found dead in his swimming pool. A highly respected young blues guitarist named Mick Taylor was named as his replacement. Taylor played on some of the band's most successful songs of the late 1960s and early 1970s including the hits \"Brown Sugar\", \"Tumbling Dice\", and \"It's Only Rock n' Roll.\" Taylor left the band in 1974. Ronnie Wood was hired as Taylor's replacement and he has been with the band ever since. Long time bassist Bill Wyman retired from the band in 1992.\nThe band remained active as a consistently successful recording and touring act throughout the 1980s and 1990s and into the 2000s. In total they have released 30 studio albums, 33 live albums 121 singles, 29 compilation albums, 32 box sets, 48 video albums and 77 music videos.\nIn 1989 The Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

{"id": "10264", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10264", "title": "Black Sabbath", "text": "Black Sabbath were an English heavy metal band. They are considered to be the inventors of heavy metal which they helped start the genre in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They have sold over one hundred million albums worldwide. The original line up was Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Tony Iommi (guitar), Terence \"Geezer\" Butler (bass) and Bill Ward (drums).\nHistory.\nBlack Sabbath formed in 1968. The band was originally named Earth and they played blues-rock music. In the band's early days Tony Iommi had a work accident that cut off the tips of his middle and ring finger on his right hand. He began tuning his guitar lower to slacken his strings to make playing easier on his wounded fingers. The result was a darker, deeper tone to his guitar sound which the band felt made their music sound dark and scary. The music also featured unusual key changes and time signatures (metre). They released their first album \"Black Sabbath\" in 1970. Their most successful single, titled \"Paranoid\", produced by Rodger Bain, came off their second album of the same name, also released in 1970.\nThe third album in 1971 was called 'Master of Reality' and sounded even more doomy than the previous two albums. After that album, the band members became addicted to cocaine, and wrote a song called 'Snowblind' to celebrate this. Their fourth album in 1972 was meant to be named after the song, but their label did not want to release an album named after an illegal drug, so they gave it the name 'Black Sabbath Vol. 4' instead. Their fifth album 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' came out in 1973 and was the first of their albums to get good reviews from critics, although their opinion of the first four albums also changed to become much more positive over time.\nIn 1975, Sabbath released 'Sabotage', which featured some longer more progressive songs, and had a less doomy feel. This change in direction continued with 1976's 'Technical Ecstasy' which received mixed reviews. Ozzy lost some interest in the band and left for a short time, but decided to rejoin in time for an eighth album, 'Never Say Die!' which received bad reviews.\nOzzy Osbourne was fired from the band in 1979 because of his drug and alcohol addiction. American vocalist Ronnie James Dio was hired to replace him. The band recorded two studio albums and one live album with him. The first studio album of the two, 'Heaven And Hell' was considered a return to success and musical form, with 'Mob Rules', recorded with drummer Vinny Appice after Bill Ward left, also getting a good reaction. Dio and Vinny parted with Black Sabbath in 1982 over different musical ideas. Bill rejoined and the band hired Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan for the critically unsuccessful 'Born Again'. \nOver the next few years after Bill left again along with Geezer, Iommi would hire several different singers to front the band, such as Glenn Hughes and Tony Martin, along with a variety of bassists (Dave Spitz, Neil Murray etc.) and drummers (Eric Singer, Cozy Powell etc.). Many of the albums released during this time were not meant to be released as Black Sabbath, with Tony Iommi wanting them to be his solo albums. \nIn 1991 Ronnie James James Dio and Vinny Appice rejoined the band again for one album and tour. After that, Tony Iommi once again hired Tony Martin alongside other different musicians. In 1997 the original line up reformed and continued to perform occasionally until 2006, when the band members were busy focusing on individual projects.\nIn 2005, Black Sabbath were inducted into the \"UK Music Hall of Fame\". In 2006 the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nIn 2011, the original line up announced they were getting back together to tour and record a new album. However, Tony Iommi was diagnosed with cancer, forcing the band to cancel most tour dates, and Bill Ward left after being unsatisfied with the contract. Tony Iommi has since been recovering, and Sabbath hired drummer Tommy Clufetos to tour with them. However, Brad Wilk is drumming on the new album, which is called '13' and was released in June 2013. The band later retired in 2017."}

It is named in honour of the physicist James Watt (1736\u20131819).\nDefinition.\nThe watt is a method of measuring the rate of energy transfer of an appliance. A one watt lightbulb, for example, will change one joule of electrical energy into light energy (and some heat/sound) every second, thus \"consuming\" it. It is a measure of an appliance's power (appetite for joules).\nThe watt is the rate a source of energy uses or produces one joule during one second, so the same quantity may be referred to as a joule per second, with the symbol J/s. It can also be written as kg\u00b7m2\u00b7s\u22123. The more watts, the more energy used per second. That is why a higher-watt electrical appliance works faster than a lower-watt appliance.\nIt is equivalent to one volt ampere (1 V\u00b7A) or 1/746 of a horsepower. The power of a light bulb is measured in watts. LEDs have much smaller consumption of power. Example small led can be used by what can be also written 15 milliwatts.\nWatt is a unit of power, joule is a unit of work and energy, and time is a unit of time. An equation for solving Power, Work and Time is Power = Work \u00f7 Time, Work = Power \u00d7 Time, or Time = Work \u00f7 Power.\nKilowatt.\n1000 watts is called a kilowatt, written as kW. It is also known as (103) watts. In many countries, electric bills are based on how many kilowatt-hours are being used.\nMegawatt.\n1000000 watts is called a megawatt, written as MW. It is also known as (106) watts. This is used to describe how much electricity is needed by a large town. \nGigawatt.\n1000000000 watts is called a gigawatt, written as GW. It is also known as (109) watts. his is used to describe how much electricity is needed for a power grid.\nExample.\nIf 1000kJ of energy was used to power one lightbulb of 100W, how long will the lightbulb last for using that energy?\nBecause Time is unknown, but you know the other two, the correct equation would be \"Time = Work \u00f7 Power\", then 1,000,000J \u00f7 100W = 10000 seconds. Then convert it into proper time and you'll get 2 hours, 46 minutes and 40 seconds."}

{"id": "10277", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10277", "title": "Suicide", "text": "Suicide is when a person chooses to kill themselves. When someone kills themselves, people say that they have \"committed suicide\" \"completed suicide\" or \"died by suicide\u201d. When a person seriously considers killing themselves, the person is described as suicidal.\nSuicide is one of the top three causes of death for young people aged 14\u201335 years-old. It is the second most common cause of death for college students. Every 3\u00a0seconds, a person somewhere in the world tries to kill themselves. Every 40\u00a0seconds, someone dies by suicide. For every suicide, at least six other people are seriously affected.(WHO 2000)\nWhen people start having thoughts about killing themselves, it may be a medical emergency. They should get a suicide risk assessment as soon as possible. They should not be left alone.\nThere are many reasons why a person might think about suicide. Most people who are suicidal have some type of mental disorder. They may have a chronic condition, which means it has been going on for a long time. But it may be an acute condition , which means the first symptoms of mental illness happened rather quickly.\nDepression is a mental illness during which may a person to have suicidal thoughts. Depression may also be a symptom of other mental or medical disorders. Another mental condition which may lead to self-harm or suicide is schizophrenia. The stress of life, and its events, like losing a job or getting sick are less likely to cause suicide. Other causes of suicidal thoughts are extreme cases of bullying and inceldom.\nAlthough depression is the main factor in suicide, it is also treatable and suicide is often preventable.\nRisk factors.\nThere are many risk factors for suicide. However, it is important to remember that risk factors are not the same as causes. Risk factors do not \"cause\" suicide or suicidal thoughts. They only make it more likely that some people with those risk factors \"may\" become suicidal. If a person has a risk factor, that does not mean they are going to become suicidal.\nMental disorders.\nMental illness is present at the time of suicide 27% to more than 90% of the time. Of those who have been hospitalized for suicidal behavior, the lifetime risk of completed suicide is 8.6%. Comparatively, non-suicidal people hospitalized for affective disorders have a 4% lifetime risk of suicide. Half of all people who die by suicide may have major depressive disorder; having this or one of the other mood disorders such as bipolar disorder increases the risk of suicide 20-fold. Other conditions implicated include schizophrenia (14%), personality disorders (8%), obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Those with autism spectrum disorders also attempt and consider suicide more frequently.\nAmong people who have a mental disorder, 25% also have alcohol abuse issues. People who abuse alcohol have a 50% greater risk of suicide compared to those who do not.\nWhile acts of self-harm are not considered suicide attempts, a person who self-harms may be more likely to die by suicide.\nSubstance abuse.\nSubstance abuse is the second most common reason for suicide and feeling suicidal. Only two serious mental illnesses - depression and bipolar disorder - cause more harm. A person is at greater risk for suicide whether they have been using drugs for a long time or just a short time. When a drug abuser is also sufffering from great sadness or grief, suicide is even more common.\nProblem gambling.\nProblem gamblers have more suicidal ideation and make more suicide attempts compared to the general population. (Problem gambling is gambling that causes major problems in a person's life.)\nIf a person becomes a problem gambler earlier in life, they have a higher risk of suicide for the rest of their life. Gambling-related suicide attempts are usually made by older people with gambling problems. Substance use and mental disorders increase the risk of suicide even more in people with problem gambling.\nMedical conditions.\nThere is a link between suicidality and medical conditions, including chronic pain, mild brain injury, (MBI) or traumatic brain injury (TBI). People with these conditions had a higher rate of suicide that was not caused by depression or alcohol abuse. People with more than one medical condition had an even higher risk of suicide.\nProblems with sleeping, such as insomnia and sleep apnea, may be risk factors for depression and suicide. In some people, the sleep problem itself, not depression, may be what increases their risk for depression.\nPeople being treated for mood disorders should be checked by a doctor. This should include a physical examination and blood tests. This can make sure the person's mood disorder is not caused by a medical problem. Many medical conditions can cause problems with mood and thinking. Seeing a doctor will also help make sure that it is safe to prescribe medications for the person's mood disorder.\nBiology.\nSome mental disorders that are risk factors for suicide may be partly caused by problems in the brain and body.\nEven if they have the same risk factors, some people are at a higher risk for suicide than others. This is partly because of genetic inheritance. Genetics causes about 30\u201350% of the difference in suicide risk among different people. For example, a person whose parent died by suicide is much more likely to try to kill themselves. Epigenetics may also affect suicide risk.\nMedia coverage.\nHow the media shows news stories of suicide may have a negative effect and trigger the possibility of copycat suicides (this is called the Werther effect). This risk is greater in teenagers and young adults.\nThe opposite of the Werther effect is the Papageno effect. This means that the media can help make suicide less likely if they cover good ways of dealing with stress and difficult things in life.\nOthers.\nA person is also more likely to die by suicide if:\nProtective factors.\nProtective factors make it less likely that a person will die by suicide. They help \"protect\" a person from the risk of suicide. They can also help protect a suicidal person from the effects of suicidal thinking.\nProtective factors can be \"internal\", such as a person's personal strengths and beliefs. For example:\nProtective factors can also be \"external,\" such as a person's relationships and life situation. These factors can include:\nProtective factors are as important to identify as risk factors. Just as risk factors can be reduced, protective factors can be increased. \nPrevention.\nSuicide prevention tries to decrease the number of suicides by using protective measures. Some prevention strategies make it harder for people to get the most common things used to commit suicide. This includes taking away guns, poisons, and drugs.\nStudies have shown that good treatment of depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse can decrease the number of suicides. So does follow-up contact with those who have made a suicide attempt.\nIn many countries, people who are at high risk of hurting themselves can check themselves into a hospital emergency department. In some countries or states, a doctor, judge, or police officer can force a person to go to the hospital if they seem suicidal, even if the person does not want to go. The person will be watched closely at the hospital to make sure they do not hurt themselves. A doctor or mental health professional will decide whether the person needs to go to a psychiatric hospital.\n\"SOS Signs of Suicide\" is a suicide prevention program used in secondary schools for students between 13 and 17 years old. The program educations students about suicide, and tests them for suicide risk. Students who have done this program make less suicide attempts than students who have not done the program.\nSuicide hotlines and crisis intervention centers help students who are at high risk. They help people who have suicidal thoughts.\nA suicide risk assessment looks at how likely a person is to attempt suicide. A good assessment can help prevent a suicide. It is also the first step in coming up with a treatment plan. Even though suicide risk assessments are very important, they are usually not done. Many mental health care workers have little or no training in how to do a suicide risk assessment.\nEpidemiology.\nWorldwide suicide rates have increased by 60% in the past 45 years, mainly in the developing countries. As of 2006:\nAccording to 2007 information, suicides happen twice as often as homicides in the United States. Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the country, ahead of liver disease and Parkinson's disease.\nSuicide rates vary a great deal across the world. Lithuania has the highest suicide rate.\n30% of deaths by suicide are by people who are intoxicated.(\nIn the United States, suicide has been increasing for African American teens. Native Americans and whites have the highest rate of suicide in the United States. More blacks than whites have committed suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic. White men are most likely to commit suicide. White males account for nearly 70% of suicide deaths. Middle-aged white men have the highest suicide rate.\nMethods.\nThe most common ways of death by suicide are not the same in every country. In different areas, they include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms.\nA 2008 report compared 56 countries, using information from the World Health Organization. It found that:\nOther people in the world die by suicide by:\nSometimes, suicidal people do something that will make another person kill them. For example, a suicidal person might point a gun at a police officer, so the police officer will shoot the person in self-defense. This is commonly called \"suicide by cop.\"\nViews of suicide.\nModern medicine treats suicide as a mental health issue. When a person starts having many thoughts about killing themselves, it is considered a medical emergency.\nThe Abrahamic religions (like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) think that life is sacred. They believe that when a person kills themselves, they are murdering what God has made. For this reason, many followers of Abrahamic religions thinks that when a person dies by suicide, they will go to Hell.\nThe Dharmic and Taoist religions (like Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto) believe that someone who does by suicide will be reincarnated in the next life with a less enlightened soul. However, many people of these religions are more likely to die by suicide because they believe that there will be a next life. They think that by dying by suicide, they may have a better chance in the next life.\nSuicide as a weapon.\nThere are several famous examples of suicide attacks in history. The Kamikazes were one example. They were Japanese fighter pilots during World War II, who would try to kill American soldiers by crashing their planes into American ships. By crashing their planes, they would kill themselves as well.\nThe September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States were also done by suicide attackers. They flew planes into the World Trade Center buildings and the Pentagon.\nOther websites.\nHelp for suicidal people.\nLearn more about suicide and how to get help for yourself or others\nHotlines"}

(Fiber is long and thin, like hair.) After, the cotton fiber is gathered from the plant, it can be spun into cotton thread. The cotton thread can then be made into cloth. The cloth can be used to make clothes for people and many other things. People often wear cotton clothing, especially in hot weather. Bandages are usually cotton. \nThere are different types of cotton plants. Some cotton plants grow wild in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. This is how cotton was discovered many years ago. Most of the cotton gathered to make cloth comes from crops grown on cotton plantations. Cotton is farmed in Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, and the Americas. Cotton soaks up to 24-27 of its own weight in water (very absorbent). All parts of cotton plants are useful.\nCotton is in the mallow family and produces delicate, lovely flowers. Other members of the mallow family include hollyhocks and hibiscus, used to brighten gardens all over the world. The cotton fiber forms around the seeds of the cotton plant. It helps carry the seeds long distances on the wind so the baby plant can grow up far away. Early humans realized that the soft, fluffy fibers might be suitable for textile use and began to breed the plant, selecting for fluffy, easily spun varieties.\nCotton is one of the oldest fibers under human cultivation, with traces of cotton over 7,000 years old recovered from archaeological sites. Cotton is also one of the most used natural fibers in existence today, with consumers everywhere wearing and using cotton for various purposes. Millions of acres globally are devoted to the production of cotton, whether it be new world cotton, with longer, smoother fibers, or the shorter and coarser old world varieties.\nAfter harvesting, cotton must be combed to remove the seeds. This was a laborious process until the industrial revolution and invention of the cotton gin, which quickly separates the seeds from the fiber and combs them for spinning. While a single cotton fiber is not terribly strong, when multiple curling fibers are straightened and twisted together, they form a strong, smooth thread that can be knitted or woven, as well as dyed."}

Microsoft had worked with Apple Computer to develop applications for Apple's January 1984 original Macintosh, the first mass-produced personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI) that enabled users to see user friendly icons on screen. Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Microsoft Windows line. It runs as a graphical, 16-bit multi-tasking shell on top of an existing MS-DOS installation. It provides an environment which can run graphical programs designed for Windows, as well as existing MS-DOS software. Its development was spearheaded by the company founder Bill Gates after he saw a demonstration of a similar software suite known as Visi On at COMDEX.\nDespite positive responses to its early presentations and support from a number of hardware and software makers, Windows 1.0 was received poorly by critics. Critics felt Windows 1.0 did not meet their expectations. In particular, they felt that Windows 1.0 put too much emphasis on mouse input at a time when mouse use was not yet widespread; not providing enough resources for new users; and for performance issues, especially on systems with lower computer hardware specifications. Despite these criticisms, Windows 1.0 was an important milestone for Microsoft, as it introduced the Microsoft Windows line. Windows 1.0 was declared obsolete and Microsoft stopped providing support and updates for the system on December 31, 2001.\nHistory.\nMicrosoft began developing a graphical user interface (GUI) in 1981. The development of Windows began after Microsoft founder Bill Gates saw a demonstration at COMDEX 1982 of VisiCorp's Visi On, a GUI software suite for IBM PC compatible computers. In 1983 Microsoft learned that Apple's own GUI software\u2014based in part on Xerox PARC technology\u2013was much more sophisticated, and decided that its own product would be different.\nMicrosoft first presented Windows to the public on November 10, 1983. Requiring two floppy disk drives and 192\u00a0KB of RAM, Microsoft described the software as a device driver for MS-DOS 2.0. By supporting cooperative multitasking in tiled windows when using well-behaved applications that only used DOS system calls, and permitting non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen, Windows differed from both Visi On and Apple Computer's Lisa by immediately offering many applications. Unlike Visi On, Windows developers did not need to use Unix to develop IBM PC applications; Microsoft planned to encourage other companies, including competitors, to develop programs for Windows by not requiring a Microsoft user interface in their applications.\nMany manufacturers of MS-DOS computers such as Compaq, Zenith, and DEC promised to provide support, as did software companies such as Ashton-Tate and Lotus. After previewing Windows, \"BYTE\" magazine stated in December 1983 that it \"seems to offer remarkable openness, reconfigurability, and transportability as well as modest hardware requirements and pricing \u2026 Barring a surprise product introduction from another company, Microsoft Windows will be the first large-scale test of the desktop metaphor in the hands of its intended users\".\nFrom early in Windows' history Gates viewed it as Microsoft's future. He told \"InfoWorld\" magazine in April 1984 that \"Our strategies and energies as a company are totally committed to Windows, in the same way that we're committed to operating-system kernels like MS-DOS and Xenix. We're also saying that only applications that take advantage of Windows will be competitive in the long run.\" IBM was notably absent from Microsoft's announcement, and by late 1984, the press reported a \"War of the Windows\" between Windows, IBM's TopView, and Digital Research's Graphics Environment Manager (GEM). Microsoft had promised in November 1983 to ship Windows by April 1984, but subsequently denied that it had announced a release date, and predicted that Windows would ship by June 1985. Deemphasizing multitasking, the company stated that Windows' purpose, unlike that of TopView, was to \"turn the computer into a graphics-rich environment\" while using less memory. After Microsoft persuaded IBM that the latter needed a GUI, in April 1987 the two companies announced the introduction of OS/2 and its graphical OS/2 Presentation Manager, which were supposed to ultimately replace both MS-DOS and Windows. In November 1987, Windows 1.0 was succeeded by Windows 2.0. Microsoft supported Windows 1.0 for 16 years, until December 31, 2001 \u2013 the longest out of all versions of Windows.\nWindows 1.01.\nVersion 1.01, released on November 20, 1985, was the first public release of Windows 1.0.\nWindows 1.02.\nVersion 1.02, released in May 1986, was an international release.\nWindows 1.03.\nVersion 1.03, released in August 1986, included enhancements that made it consistent with the international release like drivers for European keyboards and additional screen and printer drivers.\nWindows 1.04.\nVersion 1.04, released in April 1987, added support for the new IBM PS/2 computers, although no support for PS/2 mice or new VGA graphics modes was provided."}

{"id": "10291", "revid": "7885202", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10291", "title": "Eminem", "text": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), better known by his stage name Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He gained rapid popularity in 1999 with the release of the album \"The Slim Shady LP\", which won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album that year. His next work, \"The Marshall Mathers LP\", became the best-selling solo album in U.S. history. This made him known around the world, and helped publicize his record label, Shady Records, and his group, D12.\n\"The Marshall Mathers LP\" and his fourth album, \"The Eminem Show\", also won the Grammy Awards. This made him the first artist to win the Best Rap Album of the Year award three times in a row. In 2003, he won an Oscar for Best Original Song with \"Lose Yourself.\" That song was featured in his film called \"8 Mile\". \"Lose Yourself\" would become the single that for the longest time occupied the top spot of the hip-hop charts. In 2004, rumors about the end of his career were announced after the release of \"Encore.\" Those rumors were ended with the release of \"Relapse\" on May 15, 2009. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Eminem was the best selling artist of the 2000s in the United States and was the 30th best selling artist of all time in 2010, according to the ranking of the RIAA, with estimated sales of 220 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 2010, he released \"Recovery. Recovery\" was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. \"Recovery\" became the sixth album in-a-row by Eminem to start in the first position of the United States.\nEminem was voted #79 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list. On a similar list, he was ranked 82nd by Rolling Stone magazine. Including work with D12, Eminem piles up 9 albums at the top of the Billboard Top 200, 7 solo (6 studio, 1 compilation) and 2 solo with D12. He has 13 singles in the top position worldwide. Such a success made Eminem be recognized by the \"Billboard\" as the Artist of the Decade (2000-2009). According to the same \"Billboard\", the rapper had two of the five best-selling albums between 2000 and 2009. Eminem has also sold more than 17 million downloads of his songs in the United States alone. In 2009, Eminem was elected, in popular voting, the best rapper of all time by Vibe magazine, beating Tupac in the finals.\nEarly life.\nMarshall Mathers was born on October 17, 1972 in St. Joseph, Missouri. He is the only son of Deborah Nelson Mathers-Briggs and Marshall Bruce Mathers, Jr. His ancestry is diverse, including Scottish, Welsh, English, German, Swiss, Polish, and possibly Luxemburgish ancestors. His father abandoned his family when he was a year and a half old, and Marshall was raised only by his mother in poverty. At age twelve, he and his mother Deborah had moved several times and lived in several towns and cities in Missouri (including Saint Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City) before settling in Warren, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Eminem had a very troubled and unstable childhood. He frequently had his house robbed, attempted to commit suicide multiple times, and had a rocky relationship with his mother. He was frequently bullied at school for his short height. When he was 9, he was beaten up until he got unconcious and was hospitalized with a Cerebral hemorrhage.\nAfter getting a copy of the album \"Licensed to Ill\", from the Beastie Boys group as a teenager, Marshall became interested in hip-hop. He began to make raps at the age of 14 under the pseudonym \"M&amp;M\". Shortly after that, he joined the Bassmint Productions group, which released an EP titled \"Steppin' onto the Scene\". After the release of the EP, Marshall left the group and changed his stage name to \"Soul Intent\", and released his first single called \"Fuckin' Backstabber\" in 1995 under the independent record label Mashin' Duck Records. Despite being a student at Lincoln High School in Warren, he would sneak out and often participated in freestyle battles at Osborn High School in eastern Detroit. Even though most of the hip-hop members in his state were African-Americans, Marshall ended up being well accepted by the underground hip-hop public. After repeating the ninth grade three times for truancy and low grades, he dropped out of school at age 17. Although he dropped out of school, he eventually got his GED. In 1991, his uncle, Ronnie Polkingharn, committed suicide. Mathers was very close to him and was devastated by this fact. He has a tattoo remembering him on his left arm that says \"Ronnie RIP\".\nCareer.\n1992\u20131996: Early career and \"Infinite\".\nOne of Mathers' early mentors as a rapper was the local rapper Champtown, who gave Mathers his first time in a studio. Mathers also starred in his first song in Champtown's\u00a0\"Do-Da-Dipity\" from 1992. Mathers and Champtown later had relationship problems and their friendship ended in 1995. Champtown said Eminem falsely accused him of trying to get with his wife at the time, Kim. Before he began rapping, Mathers also had a few minimum wage jobs. Some of these were at a restaurant called Gilbert's Lodge and at Little Caesars.\nMathers was first signed to FBT Productions in 1992, run by brothers Jeff and Mark Bass. In 1996, his debut album \"Infinite\", which was recorded at Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released on the independent company Web Entertainment. Eminem recalls\u00a0\"Obviously, I was young and influenced by other artists, and I remember several comments saying that I looked like Nas and AZ. \"Infinite\" served me to try to figure out what my rap style was, how my voice would sound on the mic and live. It was a growth phase. I felt ' infinite ' as a demo album that ended up being pressed to become studio.\" Subjects covered in \"Infinite\" included his problems in raising his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Mathers, in a decent way while he had little money. Early in his career, Eminem formed a hip hop duo with another Detroit rapper, Royce da 5'9\", called Bad Meets Evil. After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal problems and abuse of drugs and alcohol were too much and he attempted suicide.\nJimmy Iovine, director of Interscope Records, asked for a demo from Eminem after he finished second in the 1997 Rap Olympics. Eminem had also won \"Wake Up show's Freestyle Performer of The Year\", which helped him to land a recording contract. Iovine played the demo for rap legend and producer Dr. Dre, the owner of Aftermath Entertainment. The two began recording songs for Eminem's upcoming album, \"The Slim Shady LP\" and Eminem had a cameo appearance on the album \"Devil Without a Cause\" by Kid Rock. Hip-Hop magazine \"The Source\" had Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" article in March 1998.\n1997\u20131999: \"The Slim Shady LP\".\nEminem signed for the record label Interscope Records in 1998. He released his first major studio album, \"The Slim Shady LP\", a year later in February 1999. It was based on productions by Dr. Dre. \"Billboard\" praised the album as \"light years ahead of the material he had written before\". It went on to be one of the most popular albums of 1999, and it achieved three times platinum in the United States before the end of the year. The album's popularity also brought controversy around much of the albums lyrics. In\u00a0'97 Bonnie and Clyde\" he describes a trip with his newborn daughter, Hailie, when he discards his wife's body, and in another song called \"Guilty Conscience\", it ends with persuading a man to kill his wife and his lover. \"Guilty Conscience\" marked the beginning of the friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The two would later collaborate on a lot of hit songs, including \"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What's the Difference\" from Dr. Dre's album \"2001\",\u00a0\"Bitch Please II\" from \"The Marshall Mathers LP\", \"Say What You Say\" from \"The Eminem Show\",\u00a0\"Old Time's Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from \"Relapse\" and\u00a0\"I Need a Doctor\" and \"Die Hard\" from Dr. Dre's \"Detox\". Dr. Dre would appear to have at least one guest appearance on all of Eminem's studio albums for Aftermath Entertainment. The album has now achieved 4x platinum in the US. With this release, Eminem was accused of imitating the style and word choice of underground rapper Cage.\n2000\u20132001: \"The Marshall Mathers LP\".\n\"The Marshall Mathers LP\" was released in May 2000. The album sold more than 1.78 million copies in the US in its first week, breaking both the record for the best-selling hip hop album, last held by Snoop Dogg's \"Doggystyle\", and the best-selling album in its first week in the U.S., last held by Britney Spears' \"...Baby One More Time\". The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a huge success, although it created a lot of controversy by insulting celebrities and making negative claims about them. Among other things, he claims that Christina Aguilera had oral sex with Fred Durst and Carson Daly. On the album's second single, \"The Way I Am\", he tells his fans about the pressure his record company puts on him to surpass the sale of \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodies rock musician Marilyn Manson in the song, the artists are openly friends. Manson starred in the music video for \"The Way I Am\" and he was also part of a remix of the song for a concert with Eminem. On the album's third and most successful single, \"Stan\", he samples Dido's song \"Thank You\". In the song, Eminem plays the personality of an psychopathic fan who ends up killing himself and his pregnant girlfriend, similar to the song \"'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde\" from \"The Slim Shady LP\". In the music video of \"Stan\", Eminem is shown writing with his left hand. This ended a debate between fans about his dominant hand. \"Q Magazine\" awarded Stan to be the third best selling rap song ever, while Top40-Charts.com placed the song to be the tenth best-selling rap song. The song has since been praised and the \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" ranked the song as #290 in their 500 Best Songs of All Time. In July 2000, Eminem became the first white person to come to the front page of \"The Source Magazine\". The album has received 10x platinum status from the RIAA.\nEminem appeared alongside Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in 2001. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), an organization that thought Eminem's lyrics were homophobic, didn't like the openly gay John's decision to perform with Eminem. \"Entertainment Weekly\" put the appearance on the matter with the words\u00a0\"It was the hug heard around the world. Eminem, under accusations of homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a homo icon for a performance of Stan that would have been unforgettable in any context.\" On February 21, the day of the ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center, the site where the distribution took place. He also participated in the Up In The Smoke Tour with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube. He also participated in the Family Values Tour with the band Limp Bizkit.\n2002\u20132003: \"The Eminem Show\".\nEminem's third-major album, \"The Eminem Show\", was released in the summer of 2002 and turned out to be another big hit for the rapper. The album peaked at the Billboard Hot 100, selling well over a million copies in its first week. The album's first single was the song \"Without Me\", in which Eminem made depressive comments about Limp Bizkit, Moby and Lynne Cheney, among others. Other singles from the album include \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" and \"Sing for the Moment\". The album has been certified eight times platinum by the RIAA. The album speaks on topics such as his way to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter, and his status in the hip-hop community. He also addresses his charge of assaulting a bouncer who kissed his wife in 2000. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that even though anger was present on several of the album's tracks, the album was not as provocative as \"The Marshall Mathers LP\". However, L. Brent Bozell III, who previously criticized \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" for being too tasteless and incoherent, noted that \"The Eminem Show\" used extensive obscene language and therefore gave Eminem the nickname \"Eminef\", for the \"clean version\" of the word \"motherfucker\", a word often used on the album. The album sold 10,600,000 copies, making it one of Eminem's two diamond-certified studio albums.\n2004\u20132005: \"Encore\".\nOn December 8, 2003, The Media Research Center (MRC) said that the United States Secret Service admitted that it was \"keeping an eye on Eminem\" for his allegations and threats with the President of the United States. The lyrics in question are:\nThe song, \"We as Americans\" ended up on a bonus CD accompanying the \"Encore\" album. \"Encore\" was released in 2004 and became another chart-topping leader, driven by the single \"Just Lose It\", which disrespects pop singer Michael Jackson. On October 12 of the same year, a week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson was invited to a radio show in Los Angeles where he expressed his displeasure with the music video because it parodies the trial for child abuse, plastic surgeries, and the incident in which Michael's hair caught fire during the filming of a Pepsi commercial in 1984. Many of Jackson's supporters and friends commented on the video, including Stevie Wonder, who said that the video \"is like kicking someone who is already on the ground\" and \"is idiocy\". Steve Harvey also stated, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\". He also said he was not pleased with the way he chose to show the black community. The music video also makes fun of Pee-Wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna.\nIn contrast, the comedian \"Weird Al\" Yankovic made a protest to Eminem in the song \"Couch Potato\", in which he parodies the international success of \"Lose Yourself\" of the movie \"8 Mile\". Yankovic said: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to stop the production of the parody video of \"Lose Yourself\" because he thought it would be detrimental to his image and his career. So the irony of the situation with Michael is not lost to me.\" Black Entertainment Television was the first channel to ask to stop displaying the video. However, MTV announced that it would continue to display \"Just Lose It.\" President Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott of the \"Source\" magazine, wanted not only the video to be removed, but also the song from the album, and a public apology from Eminem to Jackson, which did not occur. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought \"Famous Music LLC\" from Viacom. The acquisition thus gave them rights to the songs from Shakira, Beck and Eminem among others.\nDespite the comic issue of the first single, \"Encore\" had along with him serious subject tracks, such as the song \"Mosh\". On October 25, 2004, a week before the United States presidential election, Eminem released the music video for \"Mosh\" on the internet. The song highlights a strong anti-Bush message, with parts like \"Fuck Bush\" and \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call the president.\" The video shows Eminem gathering an army of people, including rapper Lloyd Banks, presented as victims of the Bush administration and were taken to the White House. However, at the moment the weapons break, it is revealed that people are there only to vote, and it ends with the words \"Vote Tuesday November 2!\" on the screen. After Bush was re-elected, Eminem modified the video, with demonstrators invading while the president was giving a lecture. In 2004 he also launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM radio, which was described by his manager as \"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren't playing.\"\n2005\u20132008: Retirement Rumors.\nIn 2005, many musical experts predicted that Eminem was thinking of ending his career after six years and albums with several certifications. This began in 2005, when a double album was about to be released under the name of \"The Funeral\". Subsequently, it was revealed that the album was a compilation of greatest hits, and was sold under the name \"\". The album was released by Aftermath Entertainment in December 2005, and sold almost 441,000 copies in the first week in the U.S. It was Eminem's fourth consecutive album to be number one on the Billboard Hot 100. He was certified as platinum twice by the RIAA.\nIn July 2005, the \"Detroit Free Press\" published that this would be the final stage of Eminem's career, and that he would be more interested in becoming a producer or executive of a record label. On the same day of the release of his compilation, Eminem denied that he would be retiring through the radio \"Mojo in the Morning\" of Detroit, but stated that he would give a break in his career:\nIn 2006, Eminem released a new compilation called \"\", to help the growth of the newly created Shady Records label. Eminem was the subject of the book \"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America\" by Bernard Goldberg, in which he was ranked in position 58. Goldberg quoted a column of Bob Herbert from \"The New York Times\", who said, \"In the world of Eminem, all women are whores and he is eager to rape them and then murder them\". Goldberg also cited the song \"No One's Iller\" from \"The Slim Shady EP\" as an example of misogyny. In the summer of 2005, Eminem announced a tour called Anger Management Tour, featuring artists 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and The Alchemist. In August, the European part of the tour was cancelled, as Eminem claimed that he had entered a drug rehab clinic for sleeping pill addiction treatment.\n2008\u20132010: \"Relapse\" and \"Recovery\".\nIn September 2007, Eminem spoke with 50 Cent at the Hot 97 radio station in New York City about his rumored retirement, and if he was going to release more content. In response he said, \"I'm always working. I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio... I went through some personal things. Now I'm coming out of those personal things and it feels good.\"\nEminem made his first appearance in a year in September 2008 at his radio station, the Shade 45, where he said: \"I'm concentrating on my own stuff right now\u2014just bangin' out tracks. The more I keep producing, the better it seems I get. I start knowing stuff, learning the boards like the back of my hands.\" In an interview with Billboard in December 2008, he revealed that the album would be released in the spring on 2009, be called \"Relapse,\" and most of the tracks would be produced by Dr. Dre.\nIn a statement on March 5, 2009, Eminem stated that he would release two albums that year. The first single, \"We Made You\", was released in April. \"Relapse\", the first of the announced Records, was officially released on May 19, but did not achieve the sale success as in the previous four albums. However, Eminem still received positive reviews for his return to hip hop. On November 19, he announced the release of \"\" on December 21. It was a relaunch of \"Relapse\" with the addition of seven bonus tracks, including \"Forever\" and \"Taking My Ball\".\nOn April 14, 2010, Eminem said there was no \"Relapse 2\". Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album, he had changed its title to \"Recovery.\" \u201cI had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year, but as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title.\"\n\"Recovery\" was released on June 18, 2010. It sold 741,000 copies during its first week in the US, topping the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The album also topped the charts in several other countries. \"Recovery\" remained atop the \"Billboard\" 200 chart for five weeks out of seven total.\nIts first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29, and its music video was released on June 4. \"Not Afraid\" was followed by \"Love the Way You Lie\". \"Recovery\" was the best-selling album worldwide in 2010, with over 3.4 million copies sold.\n2012\u20132014: \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\".\nOn May 24, 2012, Eminem announced that he was working on his eighth studio album, scheduled for release the following year. Some magazines such as \"XXL\" and \"Complex\" placed this album among the most anticipated of 2013 despite no name or release date being given. During the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced that the album would be named \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\" (following \"The Marshall Mathers LP\") and was going to be released on November 5. The album was released with 16 tracks. On November 3, Eminem was named the first YouTube Music Awards Artist of the Year. Eminem was the first artist to receive two digital diamond certifications for sales and streams of 10 million and above by the RIAA for \"Not Afraid\" and \"Love the Way You Lie\". At the 2015 Grammy Awards, he received Best Rap Album award for \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (with Rihanna) for \"The Monster\".\n2017-Present.\nIn February 2017, Eminem appeared on \"No Favors\", a track from Big Sean's album \"I Decided\".

She was born on Christmas Day 1995 in Detroit, Michigan from ex-wife Kimberly Anne Scott. Eminem married her in 1999 and they separated in 2001. In 2002, he told \"Rolling Stone\", \"I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again.\" He remarried Kim in January 2006 but divorced just three months later in April. He is the legal guardian of Alaina, the daughter of Kim's twin sister, and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship. He has rapped about his daughters in many of his songs.\nIn July 2012, he became the first artist to reach 60 million likes on Facebook.

The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra and hitting him with a gun when he saw him kissing his wife. He was charged with possession of a concealed weapon and assault.\nOn June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges that came from an argument with a Psychopathic Records employee.\nIn December 2003, the U.S. Secret Service reported that it was \"looking into\" accusations that Eminem threatened U.S. President George W. Bush in \"We As Americans\" when he said these lyrics: \"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents.\"\nHealth issues.\nEminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien, and Valium. In 2001, he said he believed to have been suffering from Tourette's syndrome. He revealed that he was taking up to 60 Valium and 30 Vicodin pills every day, and that doctors told him he was two hours away from dying at one point. In December 2007, Eminem overdosed on Methadone. He fell on his bathroom floor while urinating and had to be hospitalized. Due to this, he couldn't spend Christmas break with his kids. He was sent home a few days later, but was readmitted to the hospital again with a torn meniscus that required surgery. He got surgery in the following days and was released. A few days later, he was readmitted to the hospital again, this time with a seizure. Speaking about his addiction, he said, \"In seven months I was able to accomplish more than I could accomplish in three or four years of doing drugs.\" During his heavy drug use period, he revealed that he gained 80\u00a0pounds, and was going to McDonald's and Taco Bell every day. He said, \"I remember being somewhere and hearing these kids talking. One of them said, \u201cThat\u2019s Eminem,\u201d and the other said, \u201cNo it\u2019s not, man \u2013 Eminem ain\u2019t fat.\u201d I was like, Motherfucker. That\u2019s when I knew I was getting heavy.\" He also said that Elton John was the person who helped him the most with his recovery and that Elton John called him once a week to check on him."}

It is composed of pork or beef, and sometimes veal. \nWhere the word comes from.\n\"Bratwurst\" is a sausage in German cuisines, from Old High German \"br\u00e4twurst\", from \"br\u00e4t\" which is a derivative of the Old High German word \"brato\". \"Brato\" originally meant \"hacked meat\", \"intestine\"s. The other part of the word is \"wurst\" which means sausage.\nWhere the sausage comes from.\nThough originally Celtic in origin, the German \"Bratwurst\" comes from Franconia, specifically Wei\u00dfenburg-Treuchtlingen. \nMajor Types of German Bratwurst.\nThere are many different kinds of these sausages. All are special in their own way:\nA \"Bratwurst meal\" often is eaten with sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and roasted onions. Sometimes, it is also served with a potato sauce, or a potato salad.\nHow the sausage is prepared.\nToday, most kinds of Bratwurst are prepared by roasting them. Depending on the kind of Bratwurst, it may have been cooked beforehand. Sausages that use raw meat, and that are not roasted or cooked before they are eaten are usually not called Bratwurst. \nHow people eat the sausage.\nThe sausage is usually eaten with a hot or sweet German mustard or sliced and eaten as Currywurst. Sometimes, some hot French mustard is served as well. Bratwurst is almost always served with a hard German roll and usually accompanied by a beer. It is a popular snack in German-speaking countries, where it is sold at various fast food outlets and is often consumed while standing.\nBratwurst in the US.\nIn the United States, bratwurst are usually eaten with bread (a hot dog bun or a hardroll, for example) and topped with mustard and/or many of the other condiments often eaten with hot dogs, including onions (grilled and/or raw), relish, sauerkraut, etc. The bratwurst is occasionally eaten with a pair of brat links nestled in a buttered hardroll with these same toppings, which is called a 'double brat'.\nWithin the US, bratwurst is strongly identified with Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and other areas in a band stretching from the north side of Chicago up through Minnesota and scattered pockets elsewhere in the Midwest. \nThey are especially popular in areas of the US where German-Americans settled in large numbers, like Sheboygan, Wisconsin, which is informally known as the \"Bratwurst Capital of the World\" because of the city and county's very strong German roots and connections to bratwurst. Johnsonville Foods, the nation's largest bratwurst maker, is based in the nearby unincorporated village of Johnsonville. The city also celebrates Sheboygan Bratwurst Days, a community festival held on the first Thursday-Saturday of August each year that celebrates the bratwurst. Other traditional Wisconsin brat manufacturers include Klement's Sausage Company and Usinger's, both of which are based in Milwaukee.\nThe city of Madison, Wisconsin, holds an annual festival billed as the World's Largest Brat Fest. The four-day charity event sees tens of thousands of brats sold by \"celebrity\" cashiers, usually local television, radio, and government personalities. Brat Fest's self-proclaimed world record is 189,432 brats consumed during the 2004 event.\nAnother town with German-American roots associated with bratwurst is Bucyrus, Ohio, which is known for its unique recipe incorporating fennel. It holds a bratwurst festival annually in mid-August attracting over 100,000 visitors annually. \nBratwurst(s) is/are often simply called \"brat(s)\"."}

This city was destroyed by earthquakes. Finally, the capital was moved to what we know as Guatemala City.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The Aztecs built Tenochtitlan around 1325, right on a lake called Lake Texcoco.\nAs the Empire grew, so did Tenochtitlan. By the early 1500s, at least 200,000 people lived in the city. This made Tenochtitlan the largest city in the Americas before Christopher Columbus arrived.\nCenter of the Aztec Empire.\nTenochtitlan was the center of the Aztec government and religion. It was also a very big trading center. When the Spanish arrived in 1519, they guessed that 60,000 people came to the market in Tenochtitlan every day. People bought and sold many things there, including slaves (prisoners of war from states the Aztecs had taken over). The entire city was decorated with art, architecture, and stone sculptures.\nThe Great Temple.\nThe city had a huge pyramid called the Templo Mayor (Great Temple). At the top of the Temple, there were two small rooms. In these rooms, the Aztecs sacrificed people to two of their most important gods: \"Huitzilopochtli\", the god of war and the sun, and \"Tlaloc\", the rain god. The Aztecs believed that if they did not feed their gods blood, the gods would wither and die, causing the end of the world as they knew it.\nAgriculture.\nThe Aztecs had created canals all across the city. By bringing water to Aztec crops, these canals made it possible for the Aztecs to grow much more food than they normally could have. The Aztecs had also made levees to protect the city from flooding, and reservoirs for fresh water.\nThe Aztecs also built chinampas (small rectangular crops floating on lake beds) so that they could create more food to feed the thousands of people who lived around Tenochtitlan. In addition, they built waterways and dams so that they could receive fresh water, and block out the salty brackish water.\nFall of Tenochtitlan.\nIn 1519, Spanish conquistadores led by Hernan Cortes arrived in Tenochtitlan. Cortes was impressed with the city, but still decided to attack it. The Spanish and their Tlaxcalan allies invaded Tenochtitlan, and the city fell in 1521.\nMexico City was built over the ruins of Tenochtitlan."}

If malleable, a material may be flattened into thin sheets by hammering or rolling. Malleable materials can be flattened into metal leaf. One well-known type of metal leaf is gold leaf. Many metals with high malleability also have high ductility. Some do not; for example lead has low ductility but high malleability.\nMalleability is a physical property of matter, usually metals. The property usually applies to the family groups 1 to 12 on the modern periodic table of elements. It is the ability of a solid to bend or be hammered into other shapes without breaking. Examples of malleable metals are gold, iron, aluminum, copper, silver, and lead.\nGold and silver are highly malleable. When a piece of hot iron is hammered it takes the shape of a sheet. The property is not seen in non-metals. Non-malleable metals may break apart when struck by a hammer. Malleable metals usually bend and twist in various shapes.\nZinc is malleable at temperatures between 100 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C but is brittle at other temperatures."}

Today, the word usually means a person who is sexually attracted to people of the same sex and often that person can be also romantically interested in people of the same sex. A gay person can be a male who likes other males or a female who likes other females.\nThe word \"gay\" can mean any homosexual person, but sometimes it is used just for homosexual men. In that case, homosexual women are called \"lesbian\" instead. Sometimes, people use the word \"queer\" to mean the same thing as \"gay\" when talking about sexuality. \nIn the early 20th century and before, \"gay\" used to mean 'happy' or 'carefree', but now people use it to define sexuality. \nPeople who don't like gay people are called homophobes (or homophobic.) Some people are homophobes because of how they were brought up as a child. Some might belong to a religion and feel that means that homosexuality is not okay. Some homophobes are just very angry and hateful people. Homophobes often use the word \"gay\" to make fun of them(more below).\nSometimes people use the word \"gay\" as a way of saying that they think something is strange or weird.\n\"Gay\" as an insult.\nMost people use \"gay\" only when talking about someone's sexuality. Sometimes \"gay\" is used in an insulting way to mean that something is weak, stupid, or less important. For example, \"That is so gay!\" is used by bigots to say something looks or acts stupid. They may also use the word \"queer\" in the same way. This inappropriate way of using the words \"gay\" and \"queer\" is considered very offensive, as it can be an attack on someone's identity and can assume things about people they don't know."}

He was known as the creator, composer, producer, head writer, and host of the preschool television series \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" from 1968 until his retirement in 2001.\nRogers was not happy with the television shows that children were seeing. He began to write and perform local Pittsburgh-area shows for children. In 1968, Eastern Educational Television Network began nationwide distribution of Rogers's new show on WQED. For thirty years, Rogers became a television icon of children's entertainment and education.\nRogers supported many public causes. In the Betamax case, the U.S. Supreme Court used Rogers's testimony before a lower court in favor of fair-use television show recording. Rogers also testified before a U.S. Senate committee to support government funding of children's television.\nIn August 2001, Rogers retired from recording \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\". In October 2002, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and died from the disease a few months later on February 27, 2003, less than a month before his 75th birthday.\nRogers was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush, forty honorary degrees, and a Peabody Award. He was added into the Television Hall of Fame. He was listed number 35 of the \"TV Guide\"'s \"Fifty Greatest TV Stars of All Time\". The Smithsonian Institution has one of his sweaters as a \"Treasure of American History\".\nEarly life.\nRogers was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania to James Rogers and Nancy McFeely. His father was a businessman. His mother came from a rich Pittsburgh family and also was a hospital volunteer during and after World War II. His grandfather from his mother's side, Fred McFeely, was the president of McFeely Brick, one of Latrobe's largest businesses. Rogers grew up in a large brick mansion at 737 Weldon Street in Latrobe.\nHe had an adopted sister, Elaine. Rogers spent much of his free time with his grandfather McFeely, who loved music. Rogers began to play the piano when he was five and sang with his mother.\nWhen growing up, Rogers was shy and overweight. He was home schooled many times because of his asthma. Rogers had a hard time making friends and would be bullied many times as a little boy for his weight, often called \"Fat Freddy\".\nDuring his high school years in Latrobe, Rogers became more confident and popular. Rogers was president of the student council, a member of the National Honor Society and was editor-in-chief of the yearbook. He graduated in 1946. He studied at Dartmouth College from 1946 until 1948 and then went on at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida to earn a BA in music composition in 1951.\nWhile studying at Rollins, Rogers met Sara Joanne Byrd who was from Oakland, Florida. They were married on June 9, 1952. They had two sons: James, in 1959, and John, in 1961. Joanne Rogers died in January 2021, aged 92.\nRogers graduated from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and was ordained a minister of the United Presbyterian Church in 1963. Rogers returned to Pittsburgh in the 1960s.\nTelevision career.\nEarly career.\nRogers entered seminary after college but wanted to work with television. In an interview with CNN, Rogers said, \"I went into television because I hated it so, and I thought there's some way of using this fabulous instrument to nurture those who would watch and listen\". He applied for a job at NBC in New York City in 1951. He first worked as an assistant producer, and later as a network floor director on musical programs such as \"Your Hit Parade\", \"The Kate Smith Hour\", and \"The Voice of Firestone\". He also worked on Gabby Hayes's children's show.\nRogers left NBC because he did not approve of the agency using children for advertisement. He began working as a puppeteer on the local children's show \"The Children's Corner\" for Pittsburgh public television station WQED in 1954. The show won a Sylvania Award for best children's show and was broadcast nationally on NBC.\nRogers studied theology at the nearby Pittsburgh Theological Seminary during his lunch breaks. However, he did not want to go into preaching and was told to continue making children's television after his ordination. He worked with the University of Pittsburgh's child development and care program.\nIn 1963, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) hired Rogers to create the 15-minute children's program \"Misterogers.\" Rogers moved to Toronto and the series ran for three seasons. Three years later, Rogers moved back to the United States.\nIn 1966, Rogers got the rights to his program from the CBC and moved the show to WQED in Pittsburgh, where he had worked on \"The Children's Corner\".\n\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\".\n\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" began in 1968 and ran for 895 episodes. It aired on National Educational Television, which later became The Public Broadcasting Service. The last set of new episodes was taped in December 2000 and began airing in August 2001. By 1985, eight percent of people living in the United States watched the show.\nThe program always started with Rogers coming home, singing his theme song \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\". He would then change into sneakers and a zippered cardigan sweater. The sweaters were all knitted by his mother. In his show, Rogers would always go on trips, teach new things and show short movies on \"Picture, Picture\". Each episode included a trip to Rogers's \"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\" with a trolley, a castle, and the kingdom's citizens, including King Friday XIII.\nRogers always fed his aquarium fish during episodes. He would always say this to his audience he was feeding them because he received a letter from a young blind girl who wanted to know each time he did this. The program would end with Rogers winging \"It's Such a Good Feeling\".\nRogers believed not to act differently when he was being filmed to how he acted normally. He said that \"One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away\". Rogers wrote almost all of the music on the program. He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he talked about common childhood fears with comforting songs. He once took a trip to a children's hospital to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear.\nRogers would talk about social issues on his program including the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, racism and divorce. One famous episode, Rogers soaked his feet with Officer Clemmons (Fran\u00e7ois Clemmons), who was African-American, in a kiddie pool on a hot day. The scene was a message of inclusion during a time when racial segregation in the United States was common.\nRogers was also known for having children with disabilities on his show. In a 1981 episode, Rogers met a young quadriplegic boy, Jeff Erlanger, who showed how his electric wheelchair worked and explained why he needed it. Erlanger and Rogers both sang a duet of the song \"It's You I Like\". Before the taping, Erlanger had long been a fan of the program, and his parents wrote a letter to Rogers asking if they could meet.\nRogers would end each program by telling his viewers,\nRogers never talked about his religious beliefs on the show because he did not want any viewer to feel ignored from the show. During the Gulf War, he comforted his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for. Rogers asked parents to promise to take care of their children.\nIn 1990, members of the Ku Klux Klan in Missouri played racist versions of Rogers's songs and this caused Rogers to file a lawsuit against the White supremacy group. A district court judge in Missouri ordered the Ku Klux Klan to stop using Rogers's songs and to give any records they have to Rogers saying the group had committed copyright infringement.\nAfter the September 11 terrorist attacks, Rogers taped public service announcements for parents about how to discuss tragic world news events with their children. He told viewers to \"look for the helpers\". The quote continues to go viral following tragic news events. Rogers said in the public service announcement,\nPBS funding.\nIn 1969, Rogers appeared before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Communications. His goal was to ask the Senate to support funding for PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, because proposed budget cuts. In about six minutes of testimony, Rogers spoke of the need for social and emotional education that public television gave. He argued that other television programming like his \"Neighborhood\" helped encourage children to become happy citizens.\nThe chairman of the subcommittee, John O. Pastore, did not know Rogers or his work and was sometimes said to be impatient. However, after Rogers, Pastore said that the testimony had given him goosebumps, and said, \"I think it's wonderful. Looks like you just earned the $20\u00a0million\". The Senate would soon increase PBS funding from $9\u00a0million to $22\u00a0million.\nRole in \"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\".\nDuring the issues of households being able to record television programs with a VCR grew, Rogers was active in supporting VCR companies in court. His 1979 testimony, in the case \"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.\", Rogers said he was not against home recordings of his television programs because families could watch them together at a later time.\nWhen the case reached the Supreme Court in 1983, the majority decision thought about the testimony Rogers gave. The court found that the Betamax video recorder did not commit copyright violations. The court said that his views were an important piece of evidence \"that many [television] producers are willing to allow private time-shifting to continue\".\nOther works.\nIn 1978, while taking a break from taping new \"Neighborhood\" episodes, Rogers hosted an interview program for adults on PBS called \"Old Friends...New Friends\". On the show, Rogers interviewed \"actors, sports stars, politicians, and poets\". The show was lasted only 20 episodes. In 1988, he appeared on the Soviet children's television show \"Good Night, Little Ones!\" where he brought his puppet Daniel Striped Tiger with him.\nThe only time Rogers appeared on television as someone other than himself was in 1996 when he played a preacher on one episode of \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.\" Rogers voiced himself on the \"Arthur Meets Mister Rogers\" episode of the PBS Kids series \"Arthur\".\nPersonal life.\nRogers had an apartment in New York City and a summer home on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts. Rogers was red\u2013green color blind. He had a healthy lifestyle as he swam every morning and neither smoked nor drank. He was a vegetarian because he believed eating meat was wrong, saying \"I don't want to eat anything that has a mother\". Despite popular rumors, he never served in the military as a Navy SEAL during the Vietnam War and never had tattoos.\nIn 1991, the Pittsburgh Penguins named Rogers as their celebrity captain, as part of a celebration of the National Hockey League's 75th anniversary. Card No. 297 from the 1992 NHL Platinum collection celebrated the event, making Rogers one of only twelve celebrity captains to be chosen for a sports card.\nDuring his morning routine, Rogers would respond to every single fan mail and return them to the respective sender.\nIn 1992, he was awarded the Peabody Award. He was added into the Television Hall of Fame in 1999.\nIn an interview with Rogers' friend William Hirsch, Rogers said that if sexuality was measured on a scale, then: \"Well, you know, I must be right smack in the middle. Because I have found women attractive, and I have found men attractive,\" leading some readers to describe Rogers as bisexual.\nDeath.\nAfter Rogers' retirement in 2001, he remained busy working from studying religion and spirituality, making public appearances, traveling, and working on a children's media center named after him at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe with Archabbot Douglas Nowicki, chancellor of the college.\nBy the summer of 2002 his constant stomach pain had become painful enough for him to see a doctor about it, and in October 2002 he was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He had surgery on January 6, 2003, which was unsuccessful. A week earlier, he was grand marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade, with Art Linkletter and Bill Cosby.\nRogers died on the morning of February 27, 2003 after slipping into a coma, at his home in Pittsburgh. His wife was by his side when he died. He died less than a month before he would have turned 75.\nMore than 2,700 people went to his memorial service at Heinz Hall. Honorary guests included former \"Good Morning America\" host David Hartman, Teresa Heinz Kerry, philanthropist Elsie Hillman, PBS President Pat Mitchell, \"Arthur\" creator Marc Brown, and \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\" author-illustrator Eric Carle. Speakers remembered Rogers for his love of children, devotion to his religion, love for music, and humor. Teresa Heinz Kerry said of Rogers, \"He never condescended, just invited us into his conversation. He spoke to us as the people we were, not as the people others wished we were\". Rogers is buried at Unity Cemetery in Latrobe.\nLegacy and honors.\nPresident George W. Bush awarded Rogers the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002 for his works to children's education. He said that \"Fred Rogers has proven that television can soothe the soul and nurture the spirit and teach the very young\".\nIn 2003, the United States Senate passed Resolution 16 to celebrate the life of Rogers. Following Rogers' death, the U.S. House of Representatives in 2003 passed Resolution 111 honoring Rogers for \"his legendary service to the improvement of the lives of children, his steadfast commitment to demonstrating the power of compassion, and his dedication to spreading kindness through example\".\nOn New Year's Day 2004, Michael Keaton, who worked on stage on \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" before becoming an actor, hosted the PBS TV special \"Fred Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor\". His hometown of Latrobe and Pittsburgh host \"Won't You Wear a Sweater Day\" to honor Rogers. The event takes place annually on his birth date, March 20. In 2003, the asteroid 26858 Misterrogers was named after Rogers by the International Astronomical Union.\nOne of Rogers' famous sweaters was bought by the Smithsonian Institution, which has it shown on their \"Treasure of American History\" exhibit. The Fred Rogers Memorial Statue in Pittsburgh was dedicated in 2009.\nOn June 25, 2016, the Fred Rogers Historical Marker was placed near Latrobe, Pennsylvania in his memory.\nIn June 2018, the documentary \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" based on the life and legacy of Rogers, was released to positive reviews and became the highest money making biography-documentary (biodioc) of all time. Tom Hanks played Rogers in a movie based on his later life titled \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\" (2019) directed by Marielle Heller. Hanks would soon be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Rogers.\nRogers was honored on a special United States postage stamp in March 2018. On September 21, 2018, Google Doodle honored him with a stop-motion video of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\" On October 23, 2018, during the first game of the 2018 World Series, Rogers's first television commercial aired for Google's Pixel 3 smartphone. In the ad, Rogers sings \"Did You Know\" which is the first time his voice or images has been used in a commercial for a product on television.\nIn December 2019, it was announced that a statue of Rogers would be placed in at Nantucket Park in Nantucket, Massachusetts.\nAt the 2020 Academy Awards, Janelle Mon\u00e1e performed Rogers' \"Its a Beautiful Day in This Neighborhood\" during the opening ceremony while wearing a red cardigan sweater. During her acceptance speech for the Academy Award for Best Actress, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger listed Rogers as one of the heroes people should look for.\nAt the 2021 Grammy Awards, Rogers was posthumously awarded the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album for \"It's Such a Good Feeling: The Best of Mister Rogers\"."}

He was bisexual.\nCrowley also started a mystical philosophy known as Thelema, the \"Abbey of Thelema\", and revived the term magick.\nEarly life.\nEdward Alexander Crowley was born at 36 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England, between 11:00pm and 11:59\u00a0p.m. on 12 October 1875.\nIn 1895, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge after going to Malvern College and Tonbridge School. In his three years at Cambridge, his father died and left him a large sum of money.\nIn December 1896, Crowley took interest in occultism and by the next year, he began reading books on alchemy and mysticism.

{"id": "10339", "revid": "196884", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10339", "title": "Karlheinz Stockhausen", "text": "Karlheinz Stockhausen (22 August 1928-5 December 2007) was a German composer. He was an important German composer in the years after World War II. During this time composers were exploring many new ideas. Stockhausen used serialism in new ways, and he invented many ways of composing electronic music. His works include an opera cycle \"Licht\" which includes seven operas.\nLife.\nStockhausen was born near Cologne. His father was a village school teacher. His mother was put in a sanatarium in 1933 where she died in 1942. She was probably killed there because the Nazis thought people who were mentally ill should not be allowed to live.\nStockhausen was a young man during the war. He trained to be a teacher and was sent to work in a military hospital near where the army was. His father died fighting in the war. After the war, with no parents, he went to work on a farm. Then, in 1947, he went to study at the Cologne Musikhochschule. He played the piano in bars and clubs and he improvised at the piano when playing for a magician\u2019s magic shows. He was thinking of becoming a writer.\nAt this time many of Germany\u2019s important composers met every summer in Darmstadt. The course was called Darmstadt Holiday Course for New Music. Stockhausen went there in 1951. There he performed some modern music and met important people such as the music critic and philosopher Theodor Adorno. He heard the music of Messiaen and, soon after marrying, he went to Paris to study with Messiaen. In Paris he met Pierre Boulez and Pierre Schaeffer who was working on musique concr\u00e8te. He experimented with different sounds that percussion instruments can make, and he started composing electronic music. When he went back to Cologne he worked in a studio for electronic music where he studied communications theory. By this time Stockhausen, Boulez and Nono were the leading composers of avant garde or experimental music.\nStockhausen made Cologne an important centre for electronic music. He also helped to make the Darmstadt Summer Courses a famous centre for modern music. He did not invite John Cage to lecture there in 1958. This led to disagreements with Boulez and Nono. In California in 1967, Stockhausen married his second wife who was a painter. During the 1960s he bought land in the country near Cologne and had a house built there. Stockhausen did not design the house himself, because he was not an architect.\nStockhausen was by now world famous. He toured the United States and many other countries with a small group of musicians performing modern music. His music was not only listened to by fans of classical music but was also becoming part of popular youth culture. His picture was included on the front cover of the Beatles\u2019s record Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The record company Deutsche Grammophon sold more copies of his music than of any other modern composer except Stravinsky.\nDuring the 1970s Stockhausen became even more popular. This was partly because other music, like the other arts, had become political and very left-wing in the 1960s, which made people angry. It was also partly because audiences wanted a change from music that was very complicated, and Stockhausen's music had become much simpler. His most popular compositions are \"Tierkreis\" (1974\u201375) and \"In Freundschaft\" (1977). Stockhausen broke with his publisher and started to publish his music himself. From 1977 to 2003 Stockhausen composed \"Licht\" (\"Light\"), a set of seven operas named for the days of the week.\nStockhausen died of heart failure on 5 December 2007 in Kuerten.\nHis music.\nIn some student works Stockhausen used twelve tone composition. He became interested in Messiaen and his composition \"Kreuzspiel\" shows Messiaen\u2019s influence. In \"Kontra-Punkte\" (1953) the music starts with very small bits played by ten instruments. Gradually these little bits come together and at the end the music concentrates on the piano.\nFrom 1953 he worked seriously at electronic music. He thought that electronic music was going to be the music of the future. His \"Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge\" is a multi-track work, using 5 tracks (later reduced to 4). \"Gruppen\" (\"Groups\") is a work for three orchestras and three conductors. They sit in different parts of the concert hall and play at different speeds at the same time. His piano piece \"Klavierst\u00fcck XI\" (\"Piano Piece eleven\") shows no influence of John Cage at all. The music is written on a huge sheet of paper and the pianist decides as he plays which part of the music to go to next and how to play it. This means that each performance of the work is different. This is not \u201cchance\u201d music, but \"mobile\" music.\nHe continued to experiment with new ideas. \"Kontakte\" is a work for piano, percussion and electronic music (the tape has been prepared beforehand). He composed \u201clive electronic\u201d music beginning in the 1960s. This means using electronics to change the sound of normal instruments that are amplified. His operatic cycle \"Licht\" was started in 1977 and took him 26 years to complete. There are seven operas: one for each day of the week. Some of the music for this includes microtonal scales, in which the notes are tuned so that they are less than a semitone apart."}

He created many theories and ideas that are still used in psychology today. Psychology is the science of how people think and feel. His kind of psychology was called analytical psychology or \"Jungian Analysis\".\nJung worked for about seven years with Sigmund Freud early in his career, but they fell out over a theory and from 1913 went their separate ways. This was because they disagreed about what motivated people and how to understand psychology.\nJung is famous for many things that he did for psychology. The work he did was important for measuring what kind of personality people have. The test called the Myers Briggs Type Indicator is based on his ideas. He is also famous because of his ideas about the ancients - people from many years ago.\nJung spent his life learning from observation and read exceptionally widely subjects as different as philosophy, science, anthropology, religion, literature, art and historical books relating to alchemy and the occult. He thought he could learn important things about psychology from them. He investigated them to find out what symbols they contained and how ancient people tried to make sense of the world around them. Alchemy is considered a precursor of modern chemistry.\nHe wrote in academic German, for doctors, psychologists and many other educated people. Most people who study Jung start with the book \"Man and His Symbols\". It was written by colleagues of Jung so that people would be able understand him. Another useful introduction to his work is his Biography, \"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\", written mostly by his secretary, Mrs Aniela Jaffe, and to which he contributed three or four chapters.\nJung also created important terms called \"collective unconscious,\" archetypes, extraversion (outer world) and introversion (internal world). \nJung died a widower in his mid-eighties in Kusnacht, Canton of Zurich Switzerland.\nBiography.\nCarl Gustav Jung was born on 26 July 1875 in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau."}

David left the family under unknown circumstances whilst Poe was an infant. When Poe was two his mother died of tuberculosis, leaving Edgar an orphan. The wealthy John Allan took Edgar into his home in Richmond, Virginia. In 1815, the Allan family moved to England. Young Poe went to an English private school. After five years, the family moved back to Richmond, Virginia.\nAfter moving back to Virginia, Poe entered the University of Virginia in 1826. While there, he gambled, lost money, and went into debt. John Allan became angry, and cut off all contact with Poe. In 1827, Poe published his first work, a collection of poetry titled, \"Tamerlane and Other Poems\". Poe did not have his name published in the book; it was attributed to \"a Bostonian.\"\nMilitary life.\nPoe enlisted in the army. He used the name Edgar A. Perry and lied about his age. He was successful as a soldier and quickly became a sergeant major. While in the army his foster-mother Frances Allan died. Poe attempted to mend his relationship with John Allan. Poe soon left the army and enrolled at West Point in New York state.\nPoe did not enjoy his time at West Point and got very bored. He was expelled in March 1831. At this point, John Allan disowned him. Poe was well-liked by other cadets. They contributed money to pay for Poe to publish a book of his poems called \"Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems\". He soon moved to Baltimore, Maryland.\nBaltimore, Philadelphia, New York.\nIn Baltimore, Poe lived with his aunt, Maria Poe Clemm. She was the sister of Edgar's real father. Clemm also had a daughter named Virginia Clemm. Virginia admired Poe very much. In 1836, when Virginia was thirteen, she and Poe married.\nPoe was writing a lot by this time. He sold his first short story in 1832. His writing did not earn very much money. He also worked as an editor for various magazines over the years, becoming very well known for his literary criticism. Poe also was drinking off and on during these years.\nIn 1842, while Poe was living with Clemm and Virginia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Virginia became sick with tuberculosis. The family moved to the New York City area in 1843 before settling in The Bronx. On January 29, 1845, Poe published his most famous poem, \"The Raven\", making him very popular. Virginia died a few years later, on January 30, 1847.\nDeath.\nOn September 27, 1849, Poe left Richmond after a short visit. It is unknown what happened to him until October 3, when he was discovered outside of Gunner's Hall by a man named Joseph W. Walker in Baltimore. He was taken to Washington College Hospital. While in the hospital he became delirious and started seeing hallucinations. He died on October 7, 1849, in the hospital. Though it is not known what was his cause of death, there are several possible theories, including congestion of the brain, alcoholism withdrawal, tuberculosis, and rabies.\nPoe was buried in the grounds of the Westminster Church and Burying Ground after a small funeral with only a few people. On May 17, 1875, Poe was reburied at the front of the churchyard after a city-wide campaign to raise money to build a large monument. He is buried there alongside his wife Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm."}

It is similar to the original model, but it has a \"clamshell\" design, meaning that it can be folded to open and close which was later used in all the DS and 3DS models except the original 2DS. The Game Boy Advance SP has a rechargeable battery, and it does not run on two AA batteries.

Development of the Micro began in 2004. It is smaller than most handhelds and is designed to fit inside coin pockets. It retains a rechargeable battery and backlit screen from the Game Boy Advance SP. The Game Boy Micro removed backwards compatibility with original Game Boy and Game Boy Color games as it is not compatible with accessories made for the \"GBA\" and SP. It also is incompatible with the Nintendo e-Reader. The Game Boy Micro also has a removable face plate for alternative designs. The Micro did not sell well as it was overshadowed by its successor, the Nintendo DS, which also plays \"GBA\" games.\nThe Game Boy Micro has a switch on its right side to make the volume lower or higher. If the player presses the L shoulder button, it can be used to adjust the backlit screen between five different brightness levels."}

He has recorded 23 albums and more than 30 U.S. top ten hits,such as \"Superstition\", \"Sir Duke\" and \"I Just Called To Say Love You\" (which topped all the charts the board it faced). He has written and produced songs for many of his labelmates and other artists as well. His music, which concerns love, peace, care and knowledge about the outside world has won him 25 Grammy Awards(the most awarded to a male solo artist). Wonder plays the drums, guitar, synthesizers, congas, and most famously the piano, harmonica, and the keyboard. In 2009, United Nations dubbed him \"Messenger of Peace\".\nEarly life.\nHe was born on May 13, 1950 at St. Mary's of Michigan Medical Center in Saginaw, Michigan. His real name is Stevland Hardaway Judkins but he later dropped the name Morris and it has been his name for his life.\nHe has been blind since shortly after his birth. While in the hospital his incubator was left too warm, which caused his retina to detach and resulted in severe optical nerve damage.\nCareer.\nIn 1961, Wonder sang his own composition , \"Lonely Boy\" for Smokey Robinson of The Miracles. This earned wonder his contract with Motown and he was mentored by Clarence Paul.Wonder's first album, \"The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie\", was released by Motown Records in 1962 when Wonder was 12 years old. This album was to showcase Stevie's instrumental talents and contained to compositions that Wonder and Paul co-wrote - \"Session Number 112\" and \"Wondering\". He released his second album \"Tribute to Uncle Ray\" later that year, mostly covers of Ray Charles's songs including a fresh song, \"Sunset\". These two albums were released in reverse order of recording and failed to gain recognition.Clarence, feeling a song was coming on set \"Mother Thank You\" for release as a single, which was pulled and replaced with \"I Call It Pretty Music But The Old People Call It The Blues\". The song almost broke into the Billboard Hot 100, appearing at 101 before dropping out of sight. The followups \"Little Water Boy\" and \"Contract on Love\" had no success, despite the latter appearing on the Uptight album. His first live album \"Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius\" reached number one in the \"Billboard\" 200 and contained the live two part single \"Fingertips\", This made him the youngest musician ever to have a number one album in the United States and the youngest artist ever to top the chart.\nHis next few singles were not successful; his voice was changing as he got older and Motown was considering cancelling his contract. To save him, a fresh single \"Up-Tight\", co-written with Wonder was recorded in 1965 with reports saying it was based on a rhythm he had been humming and during recording the lyrics were sung back to Wonder as they were unavailable in Braille and that he \"never missed a beat\". The single charted at No.1 and an album was rushed into production the following year to back it success. This established Wonder as a genuine Motown hitmaker. Since then, he has used a Hohner clavinet.\nIn 1971, Wonder released the album \"Where I'm Coming From\", an album he expected to see what was going wrong with the world (featured the single \"If You Really Love Me\". Around the same time his label mate, Marvin Gaye released a similar album, \"What's Going On\", which spawned three singles. The albums have been compared with Marvin's seen as successful, whereas Wonder's seen as \"self-indulged, undistinguished, pretentious\" and overall lacking in unity and flow. Wanting to become a more independent artist, Wonder allowed his old Motown contract to expire.\nWonder moved to a new studio and was taught synthesiser engineering. He then met Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff who introduced him to an electric orchestra known as TONTO (The Original New Timbral Orchestra) Around the time of its release the previous year, it garnered a lot of attention. On March 3, 1972 Wonder released a new album by the name of \"Music of My Mind\", with all songs flowing together thematically. The album spawned the singles \"Superwoman\" and \"Keep On Running\". The album was a success with critics finding it representative of his artistic growth. Although he was separate from Motown, he would still submit his albums to his old record label, Tamla. Cecil and Margouleff helped him engineer the TONTO synthesiser and so were listed as associate producers. This began Wonder's classical period and marked a long collaboration with TONTO's Expanding Head Band.\nThe albums that followed were Talking Book and Innervisions, the latter winning album of the year in 1973. Wonder won his first four Grammy Awards in 1973. Two of the awards were for his single \"Superstition\" from \"Talking Book\". In 1974, Wonder's seventeenth album \"Fulfillingess' First Finale\" was released, also winning album of the year. It featured two number one singles, \"Boogie on Reggae Woman\", and \"You Haven't Done Nothin\", a hit which launched criticism against The Nixon Federation - funny enough, 2 days later, Richard Nixon resigned. Wonder won another four Grammys for the album that year. It was Wonder's second number one album. Wonder's next album \"Songs in the Key of Life\" also reached number one. This was Wonder's most critically acclaimed album and the Library of Congress called it \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". It spawned five singles , \"Sir Duke\", a song explaining the pleasures of music, \"I Wish\" wishing for childhood days to come back \"As\" a ballad of love which will last till The Impossible happens, \"Another Star\" a fast-paced Cuban style heartbreak ballad which featured on BBC's promotional video for the 2014 World Cup and \"Isn't She Lovely\" a song inspired by the birth Wonder's daughter, Aisha Morris.(Wonder would not release it as a single although instructed by a Motown executive to do so.) The former two songs reached No.1 on the Billboard charts.\nIn 1979, he released a soundtrack album, Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants for a documentary The Secret Life Of Plants. The album used a computer melodian virtually throughout. The album contain the No.1 ballad \"Send One Your Love\". The album had been called \"odd\" \"goofy\" \"nerdy\" and \"foolish\". Wonder blamed Motown for not promoting the album properly. In 1980, Wonder released Hotter Than July which included \"I Ain't Gonna stand For It\", a country-style song about a man whose property has been repeatedly trespassed, \"Master Blaster (Jammin')\", a reggae tune dedicated to Bob Marley, \"Lately\", a ballad and \"Happy Birthday\", a song in memory of Martin Luther King Jr used for Wonder's campaign to make Luther's birthday a national holiday. His next was a greatest hits album titled \"Original Musiquarium I\" featuring 4 new singles \"That Girl\", \"Do I Do\", \"Front Line\" and \"Ribbon in The Sky\". In 1983, Wonder contributed \"Stay Gold\" to the drama \"The Outsiders\". He then scheduled an album to be titled People Work, Human Play. The album never surfaced and instead 1984 saw the release of his next soundtrack album The Woman in Red.It spawned the hit single \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\" which reached number one in all the countries with charts at the time, therefore becoming his bestselling record. It was Wonder's only number one in the UK. It was number one there for six weeks. In 1985 Wonder released the digital album In Square Circle and featured on Dionne Warwick's single \"That's What Friends Are For\" with Elton John and Gladys Knight. It reached number one in the US. Wonder shared the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal. In 1987 Wonder released the album Characters which featured hit singles \"Skeletons\" and \"You Will Know\", but was subject to mixed reception. Michael Jackson's album \"Bad\" was released. Wonder featured on the album's fifth song \"Just Good Friends\". In December 1987 Wonder released a single called \"Get It\", a duet with MJ in turn for Just Good Friends.\nIn 1991, Wonder's 3rd soundtrack album, Jungle Fever was released a month before the drama film of the same name. The album helped Wonder climb back into the Top Ten in album charting.\nIn 1995 Wonder released \"Conversation Peace\". It was his first album that was not a soundtrack since 1987. One single, \"For Your Love\", was released from the album. It won 2 Grammy awards for Best R&amp;B Male Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Song.\nIn 2005 Wonder released his first album in ten years, \"A Time to Love\". Reviewers were upset with the fact it took ten years for him to release a new album with fresh material. On June 25, 2011, Wonder performed at the opening ceremony of the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece.\nWonder said in 2013 that he will release 2 new albums in 2014, and is making a third. The current working titles are Ten Billion Hearts, When The World Began and Gospel Inspired By Lula."}

He is also known as the religious symbol for God incarnate (in the flesh) among members of the Rastafari movement, who call themselves by his name before becoming Emperor - Ras Tafari.\nTafari was made into local governor of Sidamo in 1907, and Harar province in 1911. As governor of Harar, he had a huge following, but he agreed not to remove Lij Iyasu from power as regent, in exchange for Lij Iyasu not removing him as governor of Harer. However, Iyasu became a Muslim, and also he did try to remove Tafari as governor, breaking the agreement. Tafari said that now the agreement was broken, he did not have to keep it either, and so he did remove Iyasu as regent. \nBecause Iyasu had gone over to Islam, the nobles replaced him with Empress Zauditu on September 27, 1916 and made Tafari regent. From this time onward, he controlled Ethiopia. He was made \"negus\" (king) in 1928, and was crowned \"Haile Selassie I, King of Kings of Ethiopia, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Elect of God\" on November 2, 1930. His coronation was given widespread publicity throughout the world, especially through two TIME Magazine articles. This publicity created interest on the far-away island of Jamaica, where a belief in his divinity (Godliness) soon arose because of his titles, and because they saw him as a symbol of black liberation. \n1936 and after.\nIn 1936 he left Ethiopia after the invasion by Mussolini's Italy. He gave a speech at the League of Nations, asking the world to stop the Italians, but they failed to act. With the help of the British in World War Two, he was able to return to Ethiopia in 1941. In 1963, the Emperor did everything he could to help start the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) with its headquarters in Addis Ababa. In 1966, he visited Jamaica, where he met the Rastafarian community of Jamaica. \nOn September 12, 1974, he was overthrown by a Marxist coup. They said he died of natural causes the following August, but evidence later showed that they had murdered them. However, many Rastafarians claim he is still alive."}
{"id": "10484", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10484", "title": "Ethiopia", "text": "Ethiopia (, , , , Oromo: Itiyophiyaa, , Tigrinya: \u12a2\u1275\u12ee\u1335\u12eb) is a country in the Horn of Africa. It has one of the longest and most well known histories as a country in Africa and the world. Ethiopia was one of the few countries in Africa that escaped the Scramble for Africa. It avoided being colonized until 1935, when it was invaded by the Italians, who took over the country for a brief time. Ethiopia used to be called Abyssinia. The word \"Ethiopia\" is from the Greek word \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b1 (IPA: /\u02ccait\u02b0io\u02c8pia/) meaning sun light burned face. It is the most populous landlocked country in the world. It lost its Red Sea ports when Eritrea gained independence in 1993. \nHistory.\nThe conception of an Ethiopian nation is stated to have begun with the Aksumite Kingdom in the 4th century A.D. The Aksumite Kingdom was a predominantly Christian state that at the height of its power controlled what is now the Ethiopian Highlands, Eritrea, and the coastal regions of Southern Arabia. The Aksumite Kingdom was responsible for the development of the religious movement that became the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. However, the expansion of Islam in the 7th century caused the decline of the Aksumite Kingdom, and most of the lowland populations converted to Islam, while the highland people remained Christian. Since the Aksumite people became divided between Christian highlands and Islamic lowlands, religious and tribal tensions and rivalries between the people intensified. The Aksumite society changed into a loose confederation of city-states that maintained traditions and languages influenced by Aksum.\nAfter the fall of Aksum due to declining sea trade from fierce competition by Muslims and changing climate, the power base of the kingdom migrated south and shifted its capital to Kubar (near Agew). They moved southwards because, even though the Axumite Kingdom welcomed and protected the companions of Prophet Muhammad to Ethiopia, who came as refugees to escape the persecution of the ruling families of Mecca and earned the friendship and respect of the Prophet. Their friendship deteriorated when South-Arabians invaded the Dahlak islands through the port of Adulis and destroyed it, which was the economic backbone for the prosperous Aksumite Kingdom. After a second golden age in the early 6th century the Aksumite empire began to decline in the mid 6th century, eventually ceasing its production of coins in the early 7th century. Around this same time, the Aksumite population was forced to go farther inland to the highlands for protection, abandoning Aksum as the capital. Arab writers of the time continued to describe Ethiopia (no longer referred to as Aksum) as an extensive and powerful state, though they had lost control of most of the coast and their tributaries. While land was lost in the north, it was gained in the south; and, though Ethiopia was no longer an economic power, it still attracted Arab merchants. The capital was moved to a new location, currently unknown, though it may have been called Ku'bar or Jarmi.\nUnder the reign of Degna Djan, during the 10th century, the empire kept expanding south, and sent troops into the modern-day region of Kaffa, while at the same time undertaking missionary activity into Angot and Amhara.\nLocal history holds that, around 960, a Jewish Queen named Yodit (Judith) or \"Gudit\" defeated the empire and burned its churches and literature. While there is evidence of churches being burned and an invasion around this time, her existence has been questioned by some western authors. Another possibility is that the Aksumite power was ended by a southern pagan queen named Bani al-Hamwiyah, possibly of the tribe al-Damutah or Damoti of the Sidama people. It is clear from contemporary sources that a female usurper did indeed rule the country at this time, and that her reign ended some time before 1003. After a short Dark Age, the Aksumite Empire was succeeded by the Agaw Zagwe dynasty in the 11th or 12th century (most likely around 1137), although limited in size and scope. However, Yekuno Amlak, who killed the last Zagwe king and founded the modern Solomonic dynasty around 1270 traced his ancestry and his right to rule from the last emperor of Aksum, Dil Na'od. It should be mentioned that the end of the Aksumite Empire didn't mean the end of Aksumite culture and traditions; for example, the architecture of the Zagwe dynasty at Lalibela and Yemrehana Krestos Church shows heavy Aksumite influence.\nFearing of what recently occurred, Axum shifted its capital near Agew In the middle of the sixteenth century Adal Sultanate armies led by Harar leader Ahmed Gragn invaded the Ethiopian Highlands in what is known as the \"Conquest of Habasha\". Following Gragn invasions the southern part of the Empire was lost to Ethiopia and scattered several groups like the Gurage people were cut off from the rest of Abyssinia. In the late sixteenth century the nomadic Oromo people penetrated the Abyssinian plains occupying large territories during the Oromo migrations. Abyssinian warlords often competed with each other for dominance of the realm. The Amharas seemed to gain the upper hand with the accession of Yekuno Amlak of Ancient Bete Amhara in 1270, after defeating the Agaw lords of Lasta.\nThe Gondarian dynasty, which since the 16th century had become the centre of Royal pomp and ceremony of Abyssinia, finally lost its influence as a result of the emergence of powerful regional lords, following the murder of Iyasu I, also known as Iyasu the Great. The decline in the prestige of the dynasty led to the semi-anarchic era of Zemene Mesafint(\"Era of the Princes\"), in which rival warlords fought for power and the Yejju Oromo \"enderase\"s (\"regents\") had effective control. The emperors were considered to be figureheads. Until a young man named Kassa Haile Giorgis also known as Emperor Tewodros brought end to \"Zemene Mesafint\" by defeating all his rivals and took the throne in 1855. The Tigrayans made only a brief return to the throne in the person of Yohannes IV in 1872, whose death in 1889 resulted in the power base shifting back to the dominant Amharic-speaking elite prior to Yejju Oromo and Tigrayan rule. His successor Menelik II an Emperor of Amhara origin seized power. League of Nations in 1935 reported that after the invasion of Menelik's forces into non Abyssinian-proper lands of Somalis, Harari, Southern Oromo, Sidama, Shanqellaetc, the inhabitants were enslaved and heavily taxed by the gebbar-feudal system leading to depopulation.\nSome scholars consider the Amhara to have been Ethiopia's ruling elite for centuries, represented by the Solomonic line of Emperors ending in Haile Selassie I. Marcos Lemma and other scholars dispute the accuracy of such a statement, arguing that other ethnic groups have always been active in the country's politics. This confusion may largely stem from the mislabeling of all Amharic-speakers as \"Amhara\" even though they were from a different ethnic group, and the fact that many people from other ethnic groups have adopted Amharic names. Another is the claim that most Ethiopians can trace their ancestry to multiple ethnic groups, including the last self-proclaimed emperor Haile Selassie I and his Empress Itege Menen Asfaw of Ambassel of having both Amhara and Oromo linage.\nOromo migrations, occurred with the movement of a large pastoral population from the southeastern provinces of the Empire. A contemporary account was recorded by the monk Abba Bahrey, from the Gamo region. Subsequently, the empire organization changed progressively, with faraway provinces taking more independence. A remote province such as Bale is last recorded paying tribute to the imperial throne during Yaqob reign (1590-1607).\nBy 1607, Oromos were also major players in the imperial politics, when Susenyos I, raised by a clan through \"gudifacha\"(or adoption), took power. He was helped by fellow Luba age-group generals Mecha, Yilma and Densa, who were rewarded by \"Rist\" feudal lands, in the present-day Gojjam districts of the same name.\nThe reign of Iyasu I the Great (1682-1706) was a major period of consolidation. It also saw the dispatching of embassies to Louis XIV's France and to Dutch India. During the reign of Iyasu II (1730-1755), the Empire was strong enough to undertake a war on the Sennar Sultanate, where the emperor leading its army to Sennar itself, was afterwards forced to retreat upon defeat along the Setit river. Iyasu II also conferred the dignity of Kantibai of the Habab (northern Eritrea) after homage by a new dynasty.\nThe \"Wallo\" and \"Yejju\" clans of the Oromo people rise to power culminated in 1755, when Emperor Iyoas I ascended to the imperial throne in Gondar. They would be one of the major factions contending for imperial power during the ensuing Zemene Mesafint, starting from 1769, when Mikael Sehul, Ras of Tigray killed Iyoas I and replaced him with Yohannes II.\nThe establishment of modern Ethiopia was led by the Shawan people (which included both Amharas and Oromos), particularly Amhara emperors Tewodros II of Gondar, who governed from 1855 to 1868, Yohannis IV, who was from Tigray governed from 1869 to 1889 and managed to expand his authority into Eritrea, and Menelik II, who governed from 1889 to 1913 and repelled the Italian invasion of 1896.\nFrom 1874 to 1876, the Empire, under Yohannes IV, won the Ethiopian-Egyptian War, decisively beating the invading forces at the Battle of Gundet, in Hamasien province (in modern day Eritrea). In 1887 Menelik king of Shewa invaded the Emirate of Harar after his victory at the Battle of Chelenqo.\nBeginning in the 1890s, under the reign of the Emperor Menelik II, the empire's forces set off from the central province of Shoa to incorporate through conquest inhabited lands to the west, east and south of its realm. The territories that were annexed included those of the Western Oromo (non-Shawan Oromo), Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta, and Dizi. Among the imperial troops was Ras Gobena's Shewan Oromo militia. Many of the lands that they annexed had never been under the empire's rule, with the newly incorporated territories resulting in the modern borders of Ethiopia.\nEthiopia, unlike the rest of Africa, had never been colonized. Ethiopia was accepted as the first independent African-governed state at the League of Nations in 1922. Ethiopia was occupied by Italy after the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, but it was liberated by the Allies during World War II.\nAfter the war, Ethiopia annexed Eritrea. However, ethnic tensions surged between the Amhara and the various ethnic groups of Eritrea, as well as Oromo, Somali, and Tigray peoples, in Ethiopia proper, each of whom had formed separatist movements dedicated to leaving Ethiopia. After the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy by the Derg military junta, the country became aligned with the Soviet Union and Cuba after the United States failed to support it in its military struggle with Somali separatists in the Ogaden region. After the end of military government in Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea separated from Ethiopia.\nThe Kingdom of Aksum, the first known kingdom of great power to rise in Ethiopia, rose during the first century AD. The Persian religious figure Mani listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his time. It was in the early 4th century that a Syro-Greek castaway, Frumentius, was taken to the court and over time changed King Ezana to Christianity, making Christianity Ethiopia's religion. For this, he received the title \"Abba Selama\". At different times, including a time in the 6th century, Axum ruled most of modern-day Yemen just across the Red Sea.\nThe line of rulers of the actual Axumite kings ended around 950\u00a0AD when they were overthrown by the Jewish Queen Gudit; then it was followed by the Zagwe dynasty for around 300 years. Around 1270\u00a0AD, the Solomonid dynasty came to control Ethiopia, claiming that they were related to the kings of Axum (though their claim was unscientific, they were even southern Ethiopia people, like from Shewa and such). They called themselves \"Neguse Negest\" (\"King of Kings,\" or Emperor), basing their claims on their direct relation to king Solomon and the queen of Sheba.\nDuring the rule of Emperor Lebna Dengel, Ethiopia made its first good contact with a European country, Portugal in 1520. When the Empire was attacked by Somali General and Imam, Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, Portugal responded to Lebna Dengel's request for help with 400 musketeers, helping his son Gelawdewos beat al-Ghazi and remake his rule. However, Jesuit missionaries over time offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians, and in the mid-17th century Emperor Fasilidos got rid of these missionaries. At the same time, the Oromo people began to question the Ethiopian Christian authorities in the Abyssinian territories, and wanted to keep their own religion.\nAll of this led to Ethiopia's isolation during the 1700s. The Emperors became figureheads, controlled by warlords like Ras Mikael Sehul of Tigray. But Amharic is the national language of Ethiopia. Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that made friendship between the two nations; however, it was not until the reign of Tewodros II that Ethiopia began to take part in world matters once again.\nIn 1896 Italy was decisively defeated in the battle of Adwa by Emperor Menelik; an Amhara Emperor from the province of Shewa. This battle dispelled the notion that Europeans were superior and could not be defeated by a black army. It gave rise to the Pan African movement, and hope to other African countries who were conquered. This victory made Ethiopia the only African country to successfully repel a European power during the Scramble of Africa. In 1936 Italy again attacked, and succeeded in occupying Ethiopia until 1941. With British help the 5 year occupation ended and Emperor Haile Selassie regained the throne.\nRevolutionaries overthrew and killed the emperor in 1974. The resulting civil war lasted until 1991. Eritrea became independent and later fought the Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian War.\nEthiopians.\nEthiopians are the native inhabitants of Ethiopia, as well as the global diaspora of Ethiopia. Ethiopians constitute several component ethnic groups, many of which are closely related to ethnic groups in neighboring Eritrea and other parts of the Horn of Africa.\nEthiopia's population is highly diverse with different languages and ethnic groups. Most of its people speak a Semitic or Cushitic language which are both part of the Afroasiatic language family, while others speak Nilo-Saharan languages. The Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans make up more than three-quarters (75%) of the population, but there are more than 80 different ethnic groups within Ethiopia. Some of these have as few as 10,000 members.\nNational identity.\nEthiopian nationalism, also referred to as Ethiopianism, Ethiopianness, Pan-Ethiopian nationalism, Ethiopian national identity, and Civic Nationalism in Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Community, asserts that Ethiopians are a nation and promotes the equality of all component ethnic groups. Ethiopian people as a whole regardless of ethnicity constitute sovereignty as one polity. Ethiopian nationalism is a type of civic nationalism in that it is multi-ethnic in nature and promotes multiculturalism. The view espoused by Ethiopian nationalists is that Ethiopian civic nationalism is in contrast to and in opposition against ethno-nationalist supremacism fueled by ethnic federalist policies introduced by the EPRDF in which Ethiopian nationalists claim that regional subdivisions of the state were segregated according to ethnicity brought about by the partitioning and dissolution of traditionally multi-ethnic regions causing the internal displacement of people through internal population transfers. However, there has been opposition to multi-ethnic Ethiopian civic nationalism from ethnic nationalist and separatists groups as seen in the surge of ethnic tensions between various Ethiopian ethnic groups and political parties most notably among the most populous ethnic groups in the country such as the Amhara, Oromo, Somali, and Tigray peoples, most of whom who have separatist movements among their ranks, and conflict between Ethiopia and various ethnic groups that make up the Eritrean population with Eritrean Provincial Separatists vying for and later accomplishing the independence of Eritrea (who had already formed their own region specific Eritrean Nationalism and national identity of the Eritreans which has keen similarities to that of Ethiopian civic nationalism because of its multi-ethnic nature). In the aftermath of the Shewan Neftenya period that occurred, as a result of feudal lords from Shewa settling in the southern regions, other ethnic groups assimilated into the royal court culture by adopting the Amharic language, Orthodox Christianity, and other aristocratic cultural traits. The Amhara culture-influenced royal court culture dominated throughout the eras of military and monarchic rule. Both peasant Amhara culture and Ethiopian Empire royal court culture have heavily influenced each other; this Ethiopian royal court culture (that influenced and was influenced by Amhara culture) but is separate from traditional peasant Amhara culture, dominated throughout the eras of military and monarchic rule. The difference between the average Amhara people (generally those of the peasant class) and high status royal court class (which was multi-ethnic but adopted the Amharic language) are described by Siegfried Pausewang says that \"the term Amhara relates in contemporary Ethiopia to two different and distinct social groups. The ethnic group of the Amhara, mostly a peasant population, is different from a mixed group of urban people coming from different ethnic background, who have adopted Amharic as a common language and identify themselves as Ethiopians\". Due to language and certain cultural similarities, the multi-ethnic ruling class of the military and monarchic era has erroneously been described as an Amhara ruling class, in addition to the questionable existence of an ethnic group known as the Amhara people during the time periods in question, has erroneously made the terms interchangeable (even within this article). Aspects of Ethiopian nationalism have been described as a political principle centered at unification of Ethiopian identity. The ideology was promulgated throughout ancient history, from Ethiopian Empire and the Derg rule. For more than a century, Amhara ruling elite used this ideology to pursue an assimilation policy and consolidate power. The conflict started between Abyssinia, ruled by Amhara ethnic groups, and various subjugated ethnic groups such as Oromo, Sidama, and Tigray. In 1991 Eritrea achieved independence as the Derg collapsed and the TPLF assumed power and created an ethnic-federal state. The Amhara culture dominated throughout the eras of military and monarchic rule. Both the Haile Selassie and Derg governments relocated numerous Amharas into southern Ethiopia including the present-day Oromia Region, where they served in government administration, courts, church and even in schools, where Oromo texts were eliminated and replaced by Amharic. As a result of these steps, ethnic tensions surged against the Neftenya system where the Oromo, Somali, and Tigray peoples, each of whom had formed separatist movements such as the OLF, TPLF, ELF and ONLF struggled to leave the Ethiopian Empire, which led to the Ethiopian Civil War. Oromo ethnic nationalists and Ethiopian civic nationalists continue to have conflicting narratives over the status of Addis Ababa. Oromo ethnic nationalist claim that Addis Ababa should be ceded to Oromia Region and/or lead by Oromo people, while Ethiopian civic nationalists believe that it should stay as an independent city with leadership open to all people regardless of ethnicity. The Abyssinian elites perceived the Oromo identity and languages as hindrances to Ethiopian national identity expansion.\nRegions, zones, and districts.\nBefore 1996, Ethiopia was divided into 13 provinces. Ethiopia now has ethnically based regional countries, zones, districts, and neighborhoods.\nThere are nine regions, sixty-eight zones and two chartered cities. Ethiopia is further divided into 550 \"woredas\" and several \"special woredas\".\nThe nine regions and two chartered cities (in italics) are:\nEconomy.\nCoffee production is a longstanding tradition in Ethiopia."}

The capital and largest city is Salt Lake City. Utah became a state in the U.S. on January 4, 1896.\nGeography.\nUtah is bordered by Idaho and Wyoming in the north and Colorado in the east. It touches a single point of New Mexico to the southeast at Four Corners. Utah is bordered by Arizona in the south, and by Nevada in the west. It covers an area of 84,899 square miles (219,887 km\u00b2).\nUtah is mostly rocky with three distinct geological regions: the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau. Utah is a great geographical tourism place. Utah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts with sand dunes to thriving pine forests in mountain valleys.\nClimate.\nUtah has a dry, semi-arid to climate, although its many mountains have large, wide, differences of climates, with the highest points in the Uinta Mountains being above the . The dry weather from the state lying mostly in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada in California. The eastern half of the state is in the rain shadow of the Wasatch Mountains. The primary source of rain for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state normally lying in the path of large Pacific storms from mid-October through April, although northern Utah often sees these large storms earlier and later. In summer, the state, normally southern and eastern Utah, is in the path of monsoon from the Gulf of California. Most of the lowland areas get less than 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain a year. The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest area of the state, with less than 5\u00a0inches (125\u00a0mm). Snowfall is common in all but the far southern valleys. Although St. George only gets about 3\u00a0inches (7.5\u00a0cm) per year, Salt Lake City sees about 60\u00a0inches (150\u00a0cm), enhanced by the lake-effect snow from the Great Salt Lake, which increases snowfall totals to the south, southeast, and east of the lake. Some areas of the Wasatch Range in the path of the lake-effect get up to 700\u00a0inches (1,770\u00a0cm) per year. The dry, fluffy, snow led Utah's ski industry to get the slogan \"the Greatest Snow on Earth\" in the 1980s. In the winter, temperature are a phenomenon across Utah's low basins and valleys, leading to thick humidity and fog that can sometimes last for weeks at a time, normally in the Uintah Basin.\nPopulation.\nThe center of population of Utah is in Salt Lake County in the city of \"Salt Lake City\". As of July 1, 2008 the Census Bureau believes Utah has a population of 2,736,424. In 2008, the US Census Bureau determined Utah to be the fastest growing state in the country in terms of population growth.\nMuch of the population lives in cities and towns along the Wasatch Front, a region that runs north-south with the Wasatch Mountains rising on the eastern side. Growth outside the Wasatch Front is also increasing. The St. George metropolitan area is right now the second-fastest growing in the country after the Las Vegas metropolitan area, while the Heber metropolitan area is also the second-fastest growing in the country (right in front of Palm Coast, Florida).\nEconomy.\nThe University of Utah says that the gross state product of Utah in 2005 was $92 billion, or 0.74% of the total United States GDP of $12.4 trillion for the same year. The per capital personal income was $24,977 in 2005. Major companies of Utah are: mining, cattle ranching, salt production, and government services.\nIn eastern Utah petroleum making is a big industry. Near Salt Lake City, petroleum refining is done by a number of oil companies. In central Utah, coal mining accounts for much of the mining activity.\nAge and Gender.\nUtah has a high total birth rate, and the youngest population of any U.S. state. It is also one of the few non-Southern states that has more males than females.\nIn 2000, the gender percents of Utah were estimated as:\nReligion.\nMost of the state's people are members of \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\", commonly referred to as the Mormons or the LDS Church. As of 2007, 60.7 percent of everyone in the state are members of \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\". Mormons are not as common as they used to be in Salt Lake City. Usually, rural areas are almost all Mormon. Though the LDS Church does not support or oppose any political parties, the church's doctrine has a strong connection with politics. In the past, many of Utah's lawmakers have been church members; the effect has contributed to the state's towards alcohol (sales and content) and gambling. Another effect can be seen in Utah's high birth rate (25 percent higher than the national normal; the highest for a state in the U.S.). The Mormons in Utah normally have conservative views when it comes to most political . Most voter-age Utahns do not belong to a political party (60%), but vote mostly for Republicans. John McCain got 62.5% of the vote in the 2008 Presidential Election while 70.9% of people of Utah chose George W. Bush in 2004.\nPopular towns and cities.\nUtah's population is concentrated in two areas, the Wasatch Front in the North-Central part of the state, with a population of over 2 million; and southwestern Utah, locally known as \"Dixie\", with nearly 150,000 people who live there.\nAccording to the 2000 Census, Utah was the fourth fastest growing state (at 29.6 percent) in the United States between 1990 and 2000. St. George, in the southwest, is the second-fastest growing area in the United States, right behind Greeley, Colorado.\nThe state's two fastest growing counties are: \"Summit\" (at 91.6 percent; ranking it 8th in the country) and \"Washington\" (at 86.1 percent; ranking it 12th). The cities (defined as having at least 9,000 people living there in 2000) that saw the greatest increases between 1990 and 2000 were: \"Draper\" (248 percent), \"South Jordan\" (141 percent), \"Lehi\" (125 percent), \"Riverton\" (122 percent), and \"Syracuse\" (102 percent). Between 1990 and 2000 the five fastest-growing cities of any size were \"Cedar Hills\" (302 percent), \"Draper\" (248 percent), \"Woodland Hills\" (213 percent), \"Ivins\" (173 percent), and \"South Jordan\" (141 percent). The U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the five fastest-growing cities of any size between 2000 and 2008 were \"Saratoga Springs\" (1,501%), \"Herriman\" (1,061%), \"Eagle Mountain\" (934%), \"Cedar Hills\" (209%), and \"Lehi\" (146%)."}

They moved into the southern Bahamas from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century AD, having come there from South America. They came to be known as the Lucayan. About 30,000 Lucayan lived the Bahamas when Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. Columbus' first landfall in the New World was on an island named San Salvador, which some scholars believe to be present-day San Salvador Island.\nThe Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population to move to Hispaniola. They were used for forced labour. This and the exposure to foreign diseases led to most of the population of the Bahamas dying. Smallpox alone wiped out half of the population in what is now the Bahamas.\nIn 1670, King Charles II rented out the islands to the Carolinas, along with rights of trading, tax, and governing the country. During this time, the Bahamas became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard. To restore proper government, Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718. The first governor was Woodes Rogers.\nAfter the American War of Independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists and their slaves in the Bahamas from New York, Florida, and the Carolinas. The first group of loyalists left St. Augustine in East Florida in September 1783. These Loyalists established plantations on several islands.

They became well-known because they were the best crayons at that time. Later, the company made more products, including boxes of 48, 64, 96, 120 and 200 Crayons, colored pencils and markers."}

It is Norway's largest city, with a population of 647,676 people in 2015. The area near the city has a total population of 1,546,706. The city government of Oslo and the county are the same thing.\nOslo today.\nThe city is an economic and cultural epicenter. Many important institutions are in Oslo. Among these are the Norwegian government and parliament, the University of Oslo and Ullev\u00e5l Stadium, the stadium of Norway's soccer team. The city also has many museums, theaters and concert venues. Some good cultural places are Frognerparken, the Oslo Opera, the National Museum and the National Theatre. Travelling inside the city is easy with public transportation. Using tram, subway and bus is easy.\nOslo feels divided into to two parts. West end and East end, with the West traditionally being the upper/middle class area and the East end being a working class and poor area. This has faded in the last 50 years. Fewer people are manual workers and more people are employed in better paid middle-class jobs. Oslo is a very expensive city, with high prices in bars and restaurants, as well as high prices for houses and apartments.\nCurrently, the mayor of Oslo is Marianne Borgen from The Socialist Left Party.\nOslo has a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\" in the Koeppen climate classification).\nHistory.\nThe Saga of Norwegian Kings (written by Snorre Sturlason) says that king Harald III Sigurdsson founded Oslo around 1048. Recent archaeological research has found Christian graves from before 1000. Because of these two facts, Oslo celebrated its 900-year anniversary in 1950 and its 1000-year anniversary in 2000.\nOne of the more famous landmarks in Oslo is Akershus Fortress. It was first built around 1290. Oslo was destroyed in fire in 1624, and the fortress was rebuilt closer to Akershus Fortress by the order of King Christian IV of Norway. The king gave the new city the name Christiania, which later also written as Kristiania. In 1925 the name of the city was changed back to Oslo."}

{"id": "10520", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10520", "title": "Calvin and Hobbes", "text": "\"Calvin and Hobbes\" is a comic strip by Bill Watterson about a boy called Calvin and a tiger called Hobbes. When Calvin looks at Hobbes, he sees a real tiger. However, everyone else sees Hobbes as a toy. This comic began in 1985 and has been in over 2,400 newspapers. Readers bought almost 23 million Calvin and Hobbes books.\nIn the comic, Calvin spends a lot of time with Hobbes. In pictures with only Calvin and Hobbes in them, Hobbes looks like a cartoon tiger. He stands on two legs. In pictures with any other person, Hobbes looks like a stuffed animal. Calvin meets Hobbes in the first story. Calvin catches him with a string and a tuna fish sandwich as bait. Calvin and Hobbes have all sorts of trouble and adventures. The comic strip continued from November 18, 1985 until December 31, 1995.\nCharacters.\nCalvin.\nCalvin is a 6-year-old boy. He is named after a religious thinker, or theologian, John Calvin. His last name is never in the comic.\nCalvin often pretends, and he has a powerful imagination. He also does things without thinking. He is often very excited and is curious about everything. Sometimes he is selfish and rude. Calvin does not get good grades in school, but he knows very many complex words that usually only adults know. \"You know how Einstein got bad grades as a kid?\" he says. \"Well, mine are even worse!\"\nCalvin usually wears a shirt with red stripes on it. He has blond hair that stands up on his head. Watterson has described Calvin this way:\nHobbes.\nIn classic comic tradition of sidekicks, Hobbes is like Calvin's 'good side' because he is more mature and makes smarter decisions than Calvin does. When Calvin does something like throw a snowball at a girl, Hobbes will say \"You think she's cute, right?\"\nFrom most characters' point of view, Hobbes is Calvin's stuffed tiger. However, from Calvin's point of view, Hobbes is as alive and real just like other characters in the comic strip. He is named after 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who had what Watterson called \"a dim view of human nature.\" Hobbes is much more alert and aware of the bad things that can happen than Calvin is. But, he does not stop Calvin's trouble making. All that he really does is warn him. Calvin will be the one to get in trouble for doing something wrong, not Hobbes. Hobbes also likes to surprise Calvin. He approaches him quietly and then jumping on Calvin. Calvin hates this.\nFrom Calvin's point of view, Hobbes is a real, intelligent, loyal, and cunning tiger, much larger than Calvin and full of his own attitudes and ideas. But when the view changes to any other character, readers see merely a little stuffed tiger. Watterson explains it like this:\nAlthough the first strips clearly show Calvin capturing Hobbes by means of a trap (with tuna fish as the bait), a later comic (August 1, 1989) seems to imply that Hobbes is, in fact, older than Calvin, and has been around with him his whole life. Watterson decided that it was not important to explain how Calvin and Hobbes had first met.\nCalvin's family.\nCalvin's mom and dad are mostly American middle-class parents; like many other characters in the strip, their relatively realistic and sensible manners act as a contrast to Calvin's childish and selfish behavior. Both parents go through the entire strip without names. They are only called \"Mom\" and \"Dad\", or nicknames such as \"hon\" and \"dear.\" Watterson has never given Calvin's parents names \"because as far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad.\" This ended up being somewhat problematic when Calvin's Uncle Max was in the strip for a week and could not refer to the parents by name, and was one of the main reasons that Max never reappeared.\nSusie Derkins.\nSusie Derkins, the only character in the strip with both first and last names, is a classmate of Calvin who lives in his neighborhood. She first appeared early in the strip as a new student in Calvin's class. Unlike Calvin, she is polite and very smart and eager to improve in her studies and grades at school, and her imagination usually seems mild-mannered and calm, consisting of a standard young girls' games such as playing house or having tea parties with her stuffed animals. Her approach to these games is arguably more modern, however, some might say even skeptical. (In a game of \"house\" she usually casts herself as the traditional working wife while Calvin is the lousy and useless husband or some version similar to that.) \"Derkins\" was the nickname of Watterson's wife's family beagle, and he liked the name so much he named this character after it. As much as either of them hate to admit, Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common. (Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed rabbit known as \"Mr. Bun,\" and Calvin always has Hobbes.)\nWatterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a bit of a wild crush on each other (Said by Calvin, \"It's shameless the way we flirt.\"), and that Susie is inspired by the type of women Watterson himself finds attractive (which has led to speculation that Susie is based on Watterson's wife). Her relationship with Calvin, though, is frequently conflicted, and never really becomes sorted out, and the closest things are times when Calvin sends dead flowers and hate-mail as Valentine's Day gifts for his own enjoyment. (She feels he likes her enough to send her that gift, and he rejoices in her noticing.)\nSometimes Hobbes does something to attract Susie's romantic attention. He is often successful and this makes Calvin angry and jealous. Although on the surface these events take the form of Hobbes teasing Calvin and showing off his charms, they may be Calvin's way to disguise his own crush on Susie, by pretending that it is Hobbes' crush instead.\nMoe.\nMoe is a bully, \"a six-year-old who shaves\" who is always pushing Calvin against walls, forcing to give him to give away his lunch money, and calling him \"Twinky.\" Moe is the only regular character who speaks in an unusual font: his (frequently monosyllabic) dialogue is shown in rough, lower-case letters. Watterson describes Moe as \"every jerk I've ever known.\" And while Moe is not smart, he is, as Calvin puts it, streetwise. That means, as Calvin says, \"he knows what street he lives on\".\nMiss Wormwood.\nMiss Wormwood is Calvin's bored and depressed teacher, named after the apprentice devil in C.S. Lewis's \"The Screwtape Letters\". She continuously wears polka-dotted dresses, and serves like others as a foil to Calvin's rude behavior. Calvin's response to the boring studies of schoolwork is endless dreams of his imagination. She is eagerly waiting to retire, taking a large amount of medication, and is apparently a heavy smoker and alcohol drinker.\nAlthough time does change in the Calvin and Hobbes universe, which is mostly seen in the changing of the season, Calvin (and Susie) returns to Ms. Wormwood's first-grade class every fall.\nAs usual, for an adult entering Calvin's world, Miss Wormwood sees things differently from Calvin. For example, when she talks to Calvin about his missing homework, Calvin's Spaceman Spiff persona sees her as a large slimy threatening snarling alien. \"Slowly, carefully, Spiff draws his death-ray blaster\".\nRosalyn.\nRosalyn is a teenage high school senior student and the person who watches Calvin whenever Calvin's parents go on a night out together. She is the only babysitter able to put up with Calvin's bad behavior, which she uses to demand raises and advance payment from Calvin's desperate parents. She is also, according to Watterson, the only person Calvin truly fears\u2014 certainly she is his equal in sneakiness, and is willing to play as dirty as he does. Rosalyn has a habit of sending him to bed at 6:30, which he refuses to do, and only makes more trouble. Rosalyn's boyfriend, Charlie, never appears in the strip, but calls her on the telephone sometimes. Calvin often cuts short these calls. Originally, she was created as a nameless, one-time only character with no plans to appear again; however, Watterson decided he wanted to keep her unique ability to scare Calvin, which led to many more appearances.\nAt one time during the strip shown in the book collection \"The Revenge of the Babysat\", Calvin's parents prepare to go out on a night with a dinner and a movie while leaving Calvin with Rosalyn. When he finds out she is coming, Calvin runs up to Hobbes and explains the situation. Later when Rosalyn appears, Calvin and Hobbes hear that Rosalyn needs to study for a big science test. They decide to ruin her studying. After Calvin's parents leave, Calvin approaches Rosalyn, curious about what she's doing. After slyly talking her away from her science notes, he quickly grabs them, runs to the bathroom door with Hobbes, and locks the door while Rosalyn yells from he outside demanding her notes back. Once they \"flushed\" her notes (in which they only pretended to and flushed an empty toilet). Moments later when the wonder if Rosalyn has gone, Calvin opens the door only to find Rosalyn pounce upon him and throw him to bed at 7 o'clock which Hobbes notes that they went to bed 30 minutes later than usual. The ending shows Calvin's parents coming back home to find Rosalyn charge extra money for the job while Calvin's parents argue if there's another babysitter in town.\nCommon subjects.\nSnowballs and snowmen.\nDuring the winter, Calvin likes to make ugly or frightening snowmen when once Calvin created the \"Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons\". Also, his snowmen creations have had snowmen with missing or multiple heads, snowmen taking another's head for a bowling ball, and snowmen being \"knocked over\" by his family's car.\nAlso, Calvin frequently throws snowballs at Susie, most likely having himself being chased by Susie. Once Calvin (while in his \"Stupendous Man\" alter-ego) also made a gigantic snowball and dropped it at Susie while on top of a tree, as where Susie's mom described it as a \"the size of a bowling ball\".\nMonsters under the bed.\nThe monsters under the bed are described as scary, octopus-tentacled shaped creatures that lived under Calvin's bed every time he went to sleep. Often, they would try to bribe Calvin to come under the bed by giving him a new toy or by urging Hobbes to push Calvin over in return for a fresh piece of salmon. According to Calvin he'd usually describe them as \"all fangs and no brains\". They often lie to Calvin when he asks \"how many monsters are under my bed?, when they'd usually reply there's \"only one\" or \"none and go to sleep\". Although various monsters were known to exist under Calvin's bed, two named monsters \"Maurice\" and \"Winslow\" appeared and re-appeared during the strip's middle times.\nG.R.O.S.S..\nGet Rid Of Slimy Girls is Calvin's anti-girl club. The club's goal is to annoy and bother girls, and Calvin's main target is Susie Derkins. The club has only two members, Calvin and Hobbes. Calvin is \"supreme dictator-for-life\" and Hobbes is the \"first tiger\". They two usually make plans like throwing water balloons or snowballs at Susie. Often these plans have a bad ending. However, every time G.R.O.S.S finishes a mission or meeting, they always get awards such as medals, honors, and promotions. Of course, the word \"gross\" also means disgusting.\nSchool and homework.\nCalvin hates school and homework so much. He usually tries to avoid them. His Mom always makes him ride the school bus even though he does not want to, and sometimes tries to run home and not go to class. In one Sunday comic strip, Calvin's imagination became so wild and creative that he imagined getting in a F-15 Eagle airplane and blasting his elementary school to pieces with many missiles."}

This means a woman who is sexually attracted to other women, and not to men.\nThe word lesbian comes from Lesbos (), an island in Greece. An ancient poet, Sappho, lived on Lesbos. Sappho wrote mostly poems about love. Many of her love poems are written to women. So her name and the island where she lived make people think about women who love women. Sometimes lesbians are also called \"Sapphists\" from the name Sappho.\nLesbians and feminism.\nLesbians were involved in the early feminist (a movement of women who want to be treated equally to men) movement. Feminism is the political and social movements that promote women's equality and rights. However, there was conflict between lesbians and straight (heterosexual) women in the feminist movement. In the 1960s and 1970s some straight (women who like men) feminists wanted the lesbians out of the women's rights movement. They wanted feminism to be accepted by society. They believed lesbians were less accepted by society and might hurt the feminist movement.\nEventually, the women's rights movement accepted its lesbian members. Now many important feminist leaders are out (out means that they make it known that they are lesbians) lesbians.\nLesbians as parents.\nMany lesbian couples want to have children of their own. In order to raise children, they sometimes adopt. However some places do not allow homosexual couples to adopt children, so many of them want to be able to adopt children.\nSome lesbian couples also have their own biological children. To do this they may have artificial insemination. This is when sperm from a donor male is placed in a woman to make a pregnancy. Some lesbian women do this at home with a friend they choose to be the donor. However many may use \"sperm banks\". These are medical businesses that match couples who need donor sperm with men who will donate. Sometimes this is done \"anonymously\" which means the couple does not know the donor. Sometimes this is done with the donor known and even chosen by the couple.\nLaw and religion.\nUnlike gay sex between males, lesbian sex is not against the law in as many places. Some religions that condemn gay male sex say nothing about lesbian sex. Abrahamic religions usually see gay as well as lesbian relations as immoral. Saint Paul in Epistle to the Romans 1:26 describes lesbianism as 'unnatural' and 'shameful'. There are some religions, however, mostly new religious movements that accept lesbian relations.\nIn most parts of the world lesbian couples cannot marry. This means they do not have the legal benefits and protection of marriage. This can cause lesbians, and gay men, many problems. A lesbian relationship wherein one of the partners is underage is called \"korephilia\"."}

The capital is Augusta, although the city of Portland, farther south, is the largest in the state. Maine became the 23rd state, on March 15, 1820. It was previously a part of Massachusetts. Commercial Fishing, including lobster trapping, is a traditional and still vital part of the coastal economy. Tourism is a large industry in southern Maine because of its many beaches and picturesque coastal villages. Southern Maine is the part of the state that has the most people. Many other areas, to the North, are far more rural.\nGeography.\nTo the south and east is the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and northeast is New Brunswick, and the country of Canada. The Canadian province of Quebec is to the northwest. Maine is both the northernmost state in New England and the largest, accounting for nearly half the region's whole land area. Maine also has the distinction of being the only state to border just one other state (New Hampshire to the west). The municipalities of Eastport and Lubec are the easternmost city and town in the United States. Estcourt Station is Maine's northernmost point and also the northernmost point in the New England region of the United States.\nMaine's \"Moosehead Lake\" is the biggest lake that is completely in New England (Lake Champlain is located between Vermont and New York, which is not considered part of New England). A number of other Maine lakes, like as South Twin Lake, are said by Thoreau. Mount Katahdin is both the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, which to Springer Mountain, Georgia, and the southern of the new \"International Appalachian Trail\" which, when finished, will run to \"Belle Isle\", Newfoundland and Labrador.\nMaine is the only state that shares its borders with only one other American state since it only borders New Hampshire and Canada.\nClimate.\nMaine has a humid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb), with warm (although mostly not hot), humid summers. Winters are cold and snowy all over the state, and are mostly more severe in the northern parts of Maine. Coastal areas are moderated somewhat by the Atlantic Ocean. Daytime highs are mostly in the 75\u201380\u00a0\u00b0F (24\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C) range all over the state in July, with overnight lows in the high 50s\u00b0F (around 15\u00a0\u00b0C). January temperatures range from highs near 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0\u00a0\u00b0C) on the southern coast to overnight lows below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) in the far north.\nMaine is mostly safe from hurricanes and tropical storms. By the time they reach the state, many have become and few hurricanes have made landfall in Maine. Maine has fewer days of thunderstorms than any other state east of the Rockies, with most of the state with less than 20 days of thunderstorms a year. Tornadoes are rare in Maine, about two per year, mostly happening in the southern part of the state.\nIn January 2009, a new record low temperature for the state was set at \u221250\u00a0\u00b0F, tying the New England record. The state's record high temperature is 105\u00a0\u00b0F, set in July 1911.\nHistory.\nHumans have lived in Maine for many thousands of years. The Penobscot, Mi\u2019kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot Native American groups all lived there before Europeans found Maine.\nEarly during the colonial time, Maine was part of Massachusetts. It became its own state in 1820, the 23rd state in the United States of America. Its northern border with Canada was set in 1842.\nPopulation.\nAs of 2008, Maine has an estimated population of 1,321,504, which is an increase of 6,520, or 0.5%, from the past year and an increase of 46,582, or 3.7%, since the year of 2000. This has a natural increase since the last census of 6,413 people (that is 71,276 births minus 64,863 deaths) and an increase because of \"net migration\" of 41,808 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States made a net increase of 5,004 people, and migration within the country made a net increase of 36,804 people. The population density of the state is 41.3 people per square mile.\nEconomy.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Maine's total gross state product for 2007 was $48 billion. Its per capita personal income for 2007 was $33,991, 34th in the country.\nPeople in Maine produce agricultural goods like poultry, eggs, dairy products, cattle, wild blueberries (the state makes 25% of all blueberries in North America, making it the largest blueberry maker in the world), apples, maple syrup and maple sugar. Aroostook County is known for its potato crops. Commercial fishing, once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, mostly lobstering and groundfishing. Western Maine and springs are a big source of bottled water. Maine's company outputs make paper, lumber and wood products, electronic stuff, leather things, food products, textiles, and bio-technology. Naval shipbuilding and building remain key as well, with Bath Iron Works in Bath and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery. Naval Air Station Brunswick is also in Maine, and serves as a large support base for the U.S. Navy. However, the BRAC campaign recommended Brunswick's closing, despite a new government-funded effort to upgrade its facilities.\nReferences.\n\"Notes\""}

The main island of Upolu is home to nearly three-quarters of Samoa's people\nThe two large islands of Upolu and Savai'i are 99% of the total land area. There are eight small islets. These are the three islets in the Apolima Strait: Manono Island, Apolima and Nu'ulopa. There are four Aleipata Islands off the eastern end of Upolu. They are: Nu'utele, Nu'ulua, Namua, and Fanuatapu. And there is Nu'usafe'e.\nEast of Samoa is a group of islands called American Samoa. They are part of the United States, but they are similar to the country Samoa, because they also speak Samoan.\nSamoa used to be east of the international date line. In 2011, the line changed, so that Samoa would be to the west of the date line. This change took effect on the night of 29 December. Friday was skipped altogether and the following day was Saturday 31 December. \nDemographics.\nSamoa has 194,320 people. 92.6% are Samoans, 7% Euronesians (people of mixed, European and Polynesian ancestors) and 0.4% are Europeans.\nReligion in Samoa includes the following: Christian Congregational Church of Samoa 35.5%, Roman Catholic 19.6%, Methodist 15%, Latter-day Saints 12.7%, Samoan Assemblies of God 10.6%, Seventh-day Adventist 3.5%, Worship Centre 1.3%, unspecified 0.8%.There is also about 522 Jehovah's Witnessses in Samoa since 1931. Samoa has one of seven Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Houses of Worship in the world. It is in Tiapapata.\nMany people say that Samoan people are related to M\u0101ori people because lots of the language words are very similar to Maori language.\nAs with other Polynesian cultures (Hawai'ian, Tahitian and M\u0101ori), Samoans have two gender specific and culturally important tattoos. For males, it is called the Pe'a, It is intricate and geometrical patterns tattooed on areas from the knees up towards the ribs. A male who has such a tatau is called a soga'imiti. A Samoan girl or \"teine\" is given a malu. It covers the area from just below her knees to her upper thighs."}

He is called \"Swambhagwan\" in the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Vishnu is one of the three main gods in Hinduism and the Absolute Supreme being in the Vaishnava tradition. Vishnu is one of the members in the trimurti in Hinduism. Vishnu is the God of Preservation, which means he protects the universe from being destroyed. It is believed that Lord Vishnu cradles the Earth and all living organisms. According to the Hindu religion, he has come to earth in nine forms (called avatars) so far, with one incarnation yet to come that is Kalki at the end of Kali Yuga to destroy evil. His most famous incarnations are Rama, Krishna, Parashurama And Narasimha. Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth and Fortune. Lord Vishnu is usually shown with light blue skin and four arms. The Lord holds a lotus (Padma), the Indestructible Mace Of Lord Vishnu (Kaumodaki), a conch (Shankha) and the Unstoppable Disc Of Lord Vishnu (Sudarshana Chakra) in each of his four hands. He is known to take many guises, but the three main forms of Vishnu are Mahavishnu Karanodakshayi Vishnu (Mahavishnu), Garbhodaksayi Vishnu and Kshirodakashayi Vishnu. The latter two are the expansion of Karanodakshayi Vishnu.\nAvatars.\nThere are 10 Avatars of Vishnu (in the order they appeared):\nDifferent branches of Hindu tradition accept two different figures as the 9th avatar of Vishnu:\nIcons.\nLord Vishnu holds items in his four hands. The Lord holds a conch in the upper left hand, which represents victory. He holds the Sudarshan Chakra in the upper right hand, which represents spiritual energy.

The power to protect everything from anything is the reason why he is also called the Supreme protector of his devotes.\nAbsolute destruction: In the Vishnu purana, Vishnu is also described as the creator, destroyer, and preserver. As the destroyer, he can even destroy infinity or the omniverse.\nOmni-Creation Or Absolute Creation: As the creator in Vishnu purana, Vishnu has the power to create everything, even infinity and beyond. The power to have limitless power upon seeing the Supreme form of lord Vishnu arjuna describes him having infinite prowess or power.\nThe Lord has the power to do absolutely everything, even creating something that is bigger than infinity itself. In Chapter 11 Of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna/Vishnu shows Arjuna everything\u2014all of creation: time, space, past, present, future, omniverse, fictional and real human beings, and more. It is beyond human imagination to actually comprehend it.\nOmniscience: The power to have infinite wisdom experience and knowledge.\nOmnipresent: The power to be everywhere at every time including beyond the omniverse in both past present and future. When Lord Krishna/Vishnu shows his Supreme appearance, it is described being everywhere, yet people can't see it because they don't have the divine vision. Only Maharishis/sages, gods, Sanjaya, and arjuna are able to see this Vishvarupa.\nFormless: Vishnu's true form is described as formless, infinite, boundless, inapplicable, without shape and color, according to Vishnu Purana.\nAbsolute immortality: Chapter 1 of Vishnu purana describes Vishnu being boundlessly above the concept of death idea and life.\nAbsolute Transcendence/Being Above All Things: The Vishnu Purana also describes Vishnu being above all descriptions such as logic, time, space, etc. He is an infinite dimensional being according to Vishnu Sahasranamam."}

His father, Cronos, swallowed his children as soon as they were born for fear of a prophecy which foretold that one of them would overthrow him. When Zeus was born, Rhea hid him in a cave on Mount Ida in Crete, giving Cronos a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes to swallow instead. When Zeus was older he went to free his brothers and sisters; together with their allies, the Hekatonkheires and the Elder Cyclopes, Zeus and his siblings fought against the Titans in a ten-year war known as the Titanomachy. At the end of the war, Zeus took Kronos' scythe and cut him into pieces, throwing his remains into Tartarus. He then became the king of gods. \nThe supreme deity of the Greek pantheon, Zeus was universally respected and revered throughout Ancient Greece; the ancient Olympic Games were held at the site of Olympia every four years in honor of him. Highly temperamental, Zeus was armed with the mighty thunderbolt, said to be the most powerful weapon among the gods. Zeus was married to his sister, Hera, though he was infamous for his infidelity, taking on an almost innumerable amount of lovers and consorts, both mortal and divine including Karis and Hercules' mother. Zeus was known for throwing thunderbolts at people. \nThe god of honor and justice, Zeus was the one who both established and enforced law, and served as the standard for kings to follow, ensuring they did not abuse the power of their position. His symbols were the thunderbolt, a sceptre, an oak tree, and the eagle and bull were his sacred animals. His Roman equivalent is Jupiter. Zeus was the strongest Greek god, the ruler of all gods.

It works on common operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. With Firefox, browsing features can be added or removed and users can customize Firefox to fit their needs. This was done to make Firefox safe and simple to use.\nOn most operating systems, Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to load web pages, which uses up-to-date web standards. However, Firefox for iOS, which was released in late 2015, does not use Gecko due to Apple's restrictions which only allow third-party web browsers to use the WebKit-based layout engine that is built into iOS.\nFirefox was created in 2002, under the name \"Phoenix\" by the Mozilla community members who wanted a standalone browser rather than a bundle of different Mozilla applications. Even in its beta phase, Firefox proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft's then-popular Internet Explorer\u00a06. Firefox was released in November 2004 and was highly successful with 60 million downloads within nine months, marking the first time that Internet Explorer's popularity was being challenged. Firefox is considered the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator since the Mozilla community was created by Netscape in 1998.\nFirefox 3.0.\nFirefox 3.0, while it was being made, was given the name \"Gran Paradiso\". Like other Firefox development names, \"Gran Paradiso\" is an actual place; in this case, it is the second-highest mountain group in the Graian Alps.\nIn 2006, the development team asked people who used Firefox to submit ideas for features in Firefox 3.\nNetApplications says that the use of Firefox 3 had been going up quickly to a usage share of 23.75% in September 2009. They believe that this means that Firefox 3 is stable and that users are making it their main browser.\nGuinness World record.\nThe date for the launch of Firefox 3 was June 17, 2008, named \"Download Day 2008.\" Firefox was aiming to set the record for most Firefox downloads in 24 hours. As of June 18, 2008, more than 6.88 million people have downloaded Firefox 3.\nMany people tried going to the Mozilla website on June 17, making it unavailable for at least a few hours. The site was not updated for the download of Firefox 3 until 12:00 PDT. \"Download Day\" ended at 11:16 AM PDT June 18. Firefox 3 has been downloaded 28,340,281 different times.\nFeatures.\nFeatures include tabbed browsing, spell checking, incremental find, live bookmarking, Smart Bookmarks, a download manager, private browsing, location-aware browsing (also known as \"geolocation\") based on a Google service, and an integrated search system.\nAdd-ons.\nExtensions.\nExtensions let a user add new things to the browser or change how it does something. They are created by other users. Because extensions are able to access all parts of the computer that Firefox can, extensions that can harm a computer could be made. However,the extension can only change system settings if you have administrator privileges.\nThemes.\nFirefox also has themes or skinning which change the way the browser looks to the user. Some themes that can make Firefox look like other browsers, such as Internet Explorer and Netscape.\nTabs.\nTabbed browsing is a feature used in the browser where many webpages can be opened in one window, with labeled tabs on top to select the webpage. To make a new empty tab, type control-T.\nSearching.\nThere is a search box in Firefox that can be seen in the top right corner of the window. When someone using Mozilla Firefox types something in the search box and presses enter, the browser will search the Internet using a search engine like Google or Yahoo!.\nThere are \"search suggestions\" in Firefox 2. When words are typed in the search box, suggested words will appear. For example, if \"wiki\" is typed, the browser will suggest \"Wikipedia\".\nSpell checking.\nFirefox can use spell checking, if a word is typed badly into a text box, like the one where someone changes a Wikipedia page, the program will underline the word that is spelled wrong with a red line. If you scroll over that word and right click, Mozilla Firefox will list words which use the right spelling. For example: the wrong word \"chekc\" will have \"check\" as a suggestion.\nGlobal usage.\nFirefox's international usage grew to 32% by the end of 2009. After the release of Google Chrome, Firefox's popularity began to decline. , Firefox has between 9% and 16% of worldwide usage as a desktop browser, making it the second most-popular web browser. Firefox continues to be the most popular browser in Cuba, Eritrea, and Germany, with 85.93%, 79.39%, and 38.36% of the market share, respectively. According to Mozilla, there were 170 million Firefox users around the world in December 2017. With Internet Explorer declining, Firefox has reached second place in April 2018 as a desktop browser, behind Google Chrome.\nAwards.\nMozilla Firefox has been given a number of awards by many organizations.

For domesticated birds, birdboxes are often used for breeding.\nMost birdboxes feature a simple design with of six planks ordered in a cube, with a hole in a wall where birds can go in and out. Common additions include a small stick outside the hole on which birds can sit on, and a sloping roof to make rainwater run off. Some can however be highly detailed and decorated, depending on the maker's preferences. They can also be made from things like logs or gourds. They come in many sizes, depending on the size of the bird type the box is made for.

{"id": "10610", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10610", "title": "Accent", "text": "An accent is the way a person speaks. \nSome people pronounce words differently. A lot of the time, different countries that speak the same language pronounce the same words in a different way. Usually they can understand each-other, but they will notice that they sound a little different.\nSometimes, people will talk about someone's accent. They might say that the person has a German accent, or an Australian accent. An accent is the way you say the words. If you notice someone has (for example) a British accent, you can understand them (you know what they are saying), but also know they came from Britain.\nThe way a person says words usually comes from where the person was a child (where they \"grew up\", or their \"home town\") and the other people where the person lives. People learn how to say words and sentences and so they sound the same people near them when they speak.\nPeople speaking the same language can have different accents. Even people in the same country can have different accents. Sometimes people can tell what city someone lived in when they were a child by the way that person speaks. One example is a New York City accent. They might say \"bwoll\" () instead of ball (normally in America), like used in sports and games; or they might say \"hwot dwog\" () instead of hot dog (normally or in that country). It sounds different, but people still know they mean \"ball\" or \"hot dog\" when they're talking.\nWhen first trying to learn a new language, often a person will still have the old accent from their first language. That often allows other people to guess which country or place that person lived in before. \nIf someone can learn another language well enough, someone may not have the old accent anymore and may get a new accent in the new language. If someone studied German in Austria, for example, people in Germany may think that person was Austrian.\nSometimes it can be confusing for people learning a language if there are more than one common accents. If you're learning English but hear a mix of British, American, Canadian and Australian people and people from Singapore and India often, like in your school or on the Internet, it might confuse you when you hear them say the same sounds or words differently. Sometimes, people think it's better to learn the language with one accent so you can be less confused, and when you're good enough at the language, you can start to tell the different accents different people from different countries have."}

Braille is read by passing one's fingers over characters made up of an arrangement of one to six embossed points. It has been adapted to almost every known language.\nBraille was the child of a leather maker. He was the youngest of four children. He had three older siblings, two sisters and a brother. He became blind at the age of three. He accidentally stuck a stitching awl into one eye while he was in his father's workshop. There were no antibiotics and soon his injured eye was infected. It spread to his other eye and soon, he became blind in both eyes. He went to the Royal Institute of Blind Youth at the age of 10. Braille was a good student, especially when it came to science and music. Later he became a church organist. He was also a teacher at the Institute of Blind Youth. Braille died in Paris at the age of 43 of tuberculosis."}

This consists of the marsupials and their extinct ancestors. There are about 320 different species.\nReproduction.\nMarsupials give birth to living young. The young are called \"joeys\". The joeys feed on milk. They are born very small. \nMarsupials have a special pouch where they carry their joeys. After the birth the joey goes into its mother's pouch, where it can drink milk and is kept warm and safe. When the joeys are young they stay in the pouch all the time, but when they are older they can leave it for short times. When they are old enough and too big for the pouch they do not go into their mother's pouch anymore.\nBiogeography.\nMarsupials evolved before the southern supercontinent Gondwana broke off from Pangaea 100 million years ago. Early marsupial fossils have been found in Asia, from 125 million years ago. \nThey were outcompeted on Laurasia by placental mammals, but the placentals did not get into the Australasian part of Gondwana before it broke away into a separate supercontinent. That is why marsupials now found native only on the southern continents of Australasia and South and Central America, with the single exception of the \"Virginia opossum\". \nSome of the 100 living species of South American marsupials have migrated north: 13 species to Central America and one to North America. \nThere are 334 species of living Australasian marsupials. They are mostly in Australia and New Guinea, and some are on the smaller islands.\nIn more recent times the land bridge between the Americas, and reintroductions to Australia, have brought in placental mammals. They have caused the recent extinction of many marsupial species.\nList of Marsupials.\nAustralasia.\nThingodonta.\nThe extinct genus \"Yalkaparidon\" (Order Yalkaparidontia) is a bizarre fossil found in the Oligocene/Miocene deposits of Riversleigh, NE Australia.

Clapton is the son of a sixteen-year-old, Patricia Clapton, and Edward Fryer, a Canadian soldier stationed in England. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 2 on its list of \"Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2003.\nEarly years.\nEric Patrick Clapton was born in Ripley, Surrey, England on March 30, 1945. Clapton's father, who already had a wife, returned to Canada after World War II. His mother, was not able to bear the shame of raising an illegitimate child (a child of unmarried parents) in post-war Britain. She left Clapton with his grandparents Jack and Rose Clapp (Clapton by her first marriage) and moved to Germany where she married another Canadian soldier. Clapton was raised believing his mother was his sister. His grandmother did not tell him the truth until he was nine years old.\nA polite and well-behaved boy, the young Clapton was an above-average student, though in 1956 he failed the eleven-plus and went to St. Bedes Secondary Modern School. Two years later however, he passed the review and went to 13-plus on the strength of his art accomplishment and got a scholarship to a school in Tolworth, near Surbiton. He liked art very much. He wanted to learn to play the guitar after watching Jerry Lee Lewis on television. Clapton's obsession with playing blues music caused him to be expelled from Kingston College of Art because he was playing the guitar in class.\nWorking as a labourer to pay his way, Clapton spent most of his free time playing his electric guitar. Eventually he joined a local band, The Roosters. He later joined Casey Jones And The Engineers with fellow band member Tom McGuiness. In 1963, Clapton was asked to join The Yardbirds. It was in the Yardbirds that he earned his nickname of 'Slowhand'. The name came from his forceful string-bending that often caused broken guitar strings. He would replace the strings on stage while the crowd slowly clapped their hands.\nAfter about 18 months with the Yardbirds, musical differences led Clapton to move on to John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, where his talent grew even more. It was at this part in his career that Eric's fans started using the phrase Clapton is God.\nCream.\nIn mid-1966 he left the Bluesbreakers, whose members had grown to include Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. The band he formed with bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker would become Eric's best-known band, and rock's first-ever supergroup, Cream. Cream became the \"pre-eminent (best) rock trio of the Sixties\"; the name came from its members being among the top session musicians in England. They played both their own songs (\"Strange Brew\", \"Sunshine Of Your Love\", \"White Room\") and cover versions of other people's songs (\"I'm So Glad\"). Like his contemporary Jimi Hendrix, Clapton helped to pioneer the use of the wah-wah pedal. He played a famous guitar called The Fool. He also developed what he called the \"woman tone\" on his guitar and used it to great effect. For instance, at one point during the song \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\", he combines the woman tone with feedback (overdriven amplifier) to create a unique sound.\nClapton became friends with Beatle George Harrison, who asked him to play guitar on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", for 1968's \"White Album\". Clapton also played on John Lennon's \"Yer Blues\", in a filmed performance.\nWhile Cream were popular and had several hit records, problems between Baker and Bruce, and the increasing drug use of all three caused tensions that eventually broke the band up in 1969. George Harrison teamed with Clapton, to write and record \"Badge\" for Cream's final album.\nClapton played again with John Lennon and his new wife Yoko Ono, as a member of the Plastic Ono Band. He appeared with them onstage in Toronto that September, and played guitar on \"Cold Turkey\", Lennon's song about heroin addiction. At that time, the Beatles were getting ready to break up. Lennon thought about asking Clapton to join his and Ono's new band, but decided not to have a permanent lineup.\n1970's.\nClapton and Baker joined with Rick Grech and Steve Winwood to form Blind Faith. Blind Faith lasted only a few months, and released one album. After Blind Faith broke up, Clapton formed another band, called Derek and the Dominos. Their most popular song was \"Layla\". He performed a concert at the Rainbow Theatre in London on 13 January 1973, thanks to his friend Pete Townshend of The Who. He started work on a new album, \"461 Ocean Blvd\", which was released July 1974.\nThe inspiration for \"Layla\" was fashion model Pattie Boyd. She was married to Clapton's friend, George Harrison. Clapton was in love with Boyd. He was not happy because he could not be with her because she was married to his friend. In time, Boyd and Harrison grew apart, and Clapton and Boyd got together. They married in May 1979. All three remained friends, and Clapton and Harrison called themselves \"husbands-in-law\", though for some years afterwards, the friendship between them was understandably strained. Clapton and Boyd were divorced in 1989, after they also grew apart.\n1990's.\nFollowing the death of his four-year-old son Conor, who fell from a window of a 53rd-floor New York apartment owned by his mother's friend on March 20 1991, Clapton arrived at the apartment shortly after the accident. Clapton's grief was expressed in the song \"Tears in Heaven\", which was featured on his\u00a0\"Unplugged\"\u00a0album and for the 1991 \"Rush film soundtrack.\" The song was Clapton's best-selling single in the United States and reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It won three Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Tears in Heaven\" 362nd on the magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\nLater years.\nAlong with his drug problems, Clapton had trouble with alcohol, sometimes drinking a whole bottle or more of liquor in a day. In the 1990s, he was finally able to stop drinking alcohol. He also found out more about his father, who had died, and about a half-brother (by his mother) he had never met, who was mentally challenged and lived in a hospital.\nClapton is still making music and performing, sometimes with other musicians such as B.B. King.\nClapton also enjoys fishing at Eastlodge fishing."}

Johnson", "text": "Lyndon Baines Johnson (August 27, 1908 \u2013 January 22, 1973) was an American politician. He was the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. He became president when President Kennedy was killed in November 1963. He was then elected in the 1964 election. He was a Democrat. \nHis time as head of government had two chief parts, his policies inside the country which included civil rights and caring for the poor, and also his policies that were open to argument which resulted in the United States fighting the Vietnam War.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in Texas. His father was a politician who had worked for the Texas state government. As a young adult, he was a teacher. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1937, then to the Senate in 1948. He won the Senate election by just 87 votes.\nPolitical career.\nIn the Senate, Johnson very quickly became powerful and in 1955 became leader of the Senate and was the youngest to have ever held that position. He started great programs for the public. It helped that he knew the other Senators well and could often persuade them to support his ideas. In 1960, he ran for President, but during the contest to see who the Democrats would support, he lost to John F. Kennedy. Johnson was then selected by Kennedy as the candidate Vice President. Kennedy narrowly won the election and Johnson became Vice President. Like most vice presidents, Johnson did not like the job. It gave him too little power.\nLyndon B. Johnson was well known as someone who could persuade other lawmakers in Congress to pass laws. To gain more support for his ideas, he often arm-twisted other politicians (meaning he would threaten them if they didn't agree with him).\nPresidency, 1963\u201369.\nJohnson took over as President after Kennedy was assassinated. He finished Kennedy's term as president then in 1964 he ran for re-election and won easily against Barry Goldwater. Johnson won 61.1% of the vote. This is the highest percentage of the vote ever won by someone running for President since 1820.\nJohnson began a \"war on poverty\". He created the Great Society (a series of government programs intended to improve the living standards of the country). These programs include public broadcasting, protecting the environment, Medicare (health care for the elderly), Medicaid ([health care for the poor). He supported civil rights for African Americans and continued where Kennedy left off in giving them freedom. The Voting Rights Act in 1965 gave the government powers to stop them from being denied the right to vote. Compared to Kennedy's weak relationship with Congress, Johnson was able to convince politicians to support some of the same policies which they opposed under Kennedy. \nAt the same time, Johnson increased the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. Johnson increased the number of soldiers in Vietnam from 16,000 to 500,000 in order to stop the Viet Cong (the Communist rebels in South Vietnam). As the years passed, Johnson became more and more unpopular as the war kept on going without an end in sight. By 1968, almost 1000 American soldiers were being killed in Vietnam every month and the enemy still had not been defeated. In March Johnson said he would not run for re-election.\nPost-presidency, 1969\u201373.\nJohnson's time as president ended in January 1969. He went back to Texas to live on his ranch in Stonewall. He began smoking cigarettes again for the first time since 1955, and his health quickly declined. He began suffering heart attacks which later resulted in his death.\nDeath, funeral and legacy.\nJohnson died at his ranch on January 22, 1973, at age 64 after having a heart attack. Johnson had a state funeral, and the final services took place on January 25. The funeral took place at the National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C. Despite the disaster in Vietnam, Johnson is still thought of as being a good president by historians because of what he achieved with civil rights. In 1973 The Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center."}

{"id": "10754", "revid": "1046185", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10754", "title": "Catholic Church", "text": "The Catholic Church is the largest Christian church in the world. Over one billion people are members of the Catholic Church. It is the world's largest religious group. It is believed by its members to be the Church started by Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago. The headquarters of the Catholic Church is in the Vatican City.\nThe word \"catholic\" comes from the Greek word \"katholicos\", which means \"universal.\" It was first used in the Nicene Creed. Often, the word \"Roman\" is added because its headquarters is in Vatican City, a country that is inside the city of Rome, Italy. People who call themselves \"Catholics\" are members of the Catholic Church. \nAlmost half of all Catholics are in Latin America. The continent with the second-largest number of Catholics is Europe. Millions of Catholics live in other places all over the world. \nThe Catholic Church is led by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, who lives in Vatican City. According to Catholics, the Church is guided by the Holy Spirit who also guides the Pope. The Church teaches that when the Pope speaks officially on the subject of Catholic faith and morals, he cannot be wrong. The Popes have only used this infallibility very rarely, but have done so throughout history; some examples include the Tome of St. Leo, the declaration of the Immaculate Conception, and various anathemas (religious condemnations issued by the Popes against certain heresies).\nThe Catholic Church teaches that the first Pope was Saint Peter, who was a disciple of Jesus Christ. The current pope is Pope Francis.\nFaith and morals.\nLike other Christians, Catholics believe Jesus is a divine person, the Son of God. They believe that because of his love for all people, he died so that all people will live forever in heaven.\nThe Catholic Church also recognizes the Trinity; that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are together the only God.\nThe Pope.\nThe leader of the Roman Catholic Church is called the Pope, which literally means \"father\". Catholics say Jesus Christ established the Catholic Church, and appointed the first Pope, a disciple of his named Saint Peter, to lead all Christians.\nOver the last 2,000 years, different Popes have led the church. The current Pope is the 266th and is called Francis and he lives in the Vatican City, a very small country inside the city of Rome, Italy.\nFor centuries, Popes have not used their birth names, but instead use a regnal name. This custom started in the sixth century when a man named Mercury was elected Pope, it was seen as inappropriate to have a Pope named after a pagan god so he named himself John II, in honor of his predecessor, John I; it became customary in the tenth century. Since the death of Marcellus II 1555, every Pope has taken a Papal name. \nThe Catholic Church is made of 23 \"particular churches\", otherwise known as \"rites\". As well as being head of the Latin Rite of the church (which is the largest with over 1 billion members), the Pope is ultimately the leader of 22 Eastern Catholic Churches, these churches are of the Orthodox tradition of Christianity and it is often the case that they have broken away from their Orthodox mother church to come into communion with (join) the Pope and submit to his authority as successor of St. Peter. The Eastern Catholic Churches are based all over the world, from the United States to the Middle East to India.\nThe exercise of infallibility takes several forms (see \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", no. 890-891, citing \"Lumen Gentium\", 25). One form is exercised by the Pope when speaking \"ex cathedra\" (literally, \u201cfrom the chair\u201d of St. Peter, in his authority as pope) on matters of faith or morals, even if he does so without the support of the bishops. This is an exercise of the Extraordinary Magisterium of the Church. While the pope has always held the power to exercise the Extraordinary Magisterium by speaking \"ex cathedra\", the actual occurrence of an \"ex cathedra\" statement is quite rare. It is generally understood to have only occurred twice: Pope Pius IX\u2019s definition of the dogma of Mary\u2019s Immaculate Conception in 1854 and Pope Pius XII\u2019s definition of the dogma of Mary\u2019s Assumption in 1950. In both of these cases, the Pope was not teaching something new. Rather, he was confirming and clarifying something that the Church had already believed as part of God\u2019s revelation.\nWorship practices.\nSome of the traditional practices of Roman Catholics carried out each time they pray at home or at Church include making the sign of the cross, kneeling, and bowing.\nTheir main ceremony is the Mass. Catholics are normally required to go to amass on Sundays and on Holy Days of Obligation. In the United States, the Holy Days of Obligation are: Mary, Mother of God (January 1), The Assumption of Mary (August 15), The Immaculate Conception (of Mary) (December 8), The Ascension of Jesus (40 days after Easter), Christmas (December 25) and All Saints Day (November 1). The taking of the Eucharist is the height of the Mass.\nCatholics worship Jesus. They also venerate the Virgin Mary more than other Christians, calling her the \"Mother of God,\" based on Elizabeth's greeting, \"And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\" and also on the belief that all Christians hold that Jesus is fully man and fully God at the same time. Yet, Mary, who has nothing to do with the Divine, was chosen as the human vessel God would use to enter into the world. It is important to note that Catholics do not worship Mary. Instead, they honor her as one honors a Queen. This type of honor is called hyperdulia.\nAn important Catholic prayer is the Rosary. This prayer is done with Rosary beads used to count each prayer. The Rosary is made up of five decades, each decade being made up of 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, and 1 Glory Be, as well as saying the Sacred Mysteries. It is made up of passages taken from scripture. It is recommended by the clergy to continue the very old practice of praying the Rosary daily, as it has not only many powerful requests but is made up of words taken directly from scripture, like the Lord's Prayer (Our Father) and the Hail Mary. The Rosary is not complete unless one thinks about the passion of Christ while praying out loud. In addition, the clergy (bishops, priests, and deacons) must pray the Divine Office. \nSacraments.\nThe Catholic Church celebrates seven sacraments. A sacrament is \"an outward sign instituted (started) by Christ to give grace\" (a supernatural gift of God that someone did nothing to deserve).\nThe seven sacraments are: Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Holy Matrimony (marriage). The Holy Eucharist is the most important of the sacraments, because Catholics believe that Jesus Christ becomes truly present in the form of bread and wine. This happens through transubstantiation which takes place in the Mass.\nCatholics believe in the necessity of love, hope and faith in order to gain salvation, but that these all come from grace. This is different from the 16th century interpretation created by Luther.\nCatholics interpret the Bible (God-given book) according to Tradition. Tradition is the transmission of the early church's life and teaching, as especially recorded in the writings of the Fathers of the Church who lived in the first centuries. At that time the holy books where accepted in the Bible, which is the collection of the books considered revealed.\nA basic rule for Catholics is that \"Truth cannot contradict truth\". They translate the Bible with this in mind. No interpretation can be accepted if it contradicts another revealed truth.\nNicene Creed.\nCatholics, like many Christians, accept the Nicene Creed, a combination of the Council of Nicaea (AD 325) and the later Council of Constantinople (AD 382) as true. It is as follows:\n\"I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and our salvation He came down from heaven: and, by the Holy Spirit, was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake, He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered death and was buried and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures: He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and His kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, Who, with the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified, Who has spoken through the Prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.\"\nEastern Orthodox and Protestants believe many of the same things. They sometime disagree on the role of the Virgin Mary and other saints, on what a priest can do, and on how exactly God should be worshipped, among other things."}

She was the 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Clinton was the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election. She is a former U.S. Senator, First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas.\nFrom 2009 to 2013, she was the 67th Secretary of State, serving under President Barack Obama. Before that, she was the junior United States Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009. She is married to former President of the United States Bill Clinton in 1975. When her husband was president, she had the title of First Lady of the United States. She was a candidate in the 2008 election of a new President. She is a member of the Democratic Party.\nHillary Clinton was the first former First Lady to be elected to the U.S. Senate and to hold a federal cabinet-level position. She ran for re-election to the Senate in 2006, which she won, and was considered by many in the media and politics as having a good chance to win in the race for the Democratic Party's US presidential nomination in 2008, but she lost to Barack Obama.\nIn April 2015, Clinton announced that she would be running for president once again for the 2016 United States presidential election. During the Democratic presidential primaries, Clinton faced challenges from United States senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders. On June 6, 2016, Clinton reached the number of delegates to become the presumptive Democratic Party nominee. She lost the election to Donald Trump on November 8, 2016.\nEarly life and education.\nHillary Diane Rodham was born at Edgewater Medical Center in Chicago. She was raised in Park Ridge, a suburb located northwest of downtown Chicago. Her parents were Hugh E. Rodham and Dorothy Emma Howell Rodham. She is of Welsh, English, French and French Canadian ancestry. Hillary grew up with two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.\nShe studied at Maine East High School and Maine South High School. She finished high school in 1965, and enrolled at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.\nIn 1969, Rodham entered Yale Law School. She received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Yale in 1973. Then, she began a year of post-graduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.\nFirst Lady of the United States (1993-2001).\nWhen she was First Lady, she tried to change the health care system. Some people didn't like it when the planning meetings were kept secret away from the public. In the end, too many people did not want the changes that she wanted.\nAnother major event during the time she was First Lady was when the public found out in 1998 that Bill Clinton had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky in the mid 1990s. There was stress in the marriage partly because Bill had to go to trial (impeachment) because he was accused of lying to the court (during a deposition).\nSenate (2001-2009).\nWhen she decided that she wanted to be Senator, she chose New York even though she never lived there. Some accused her of \"carpetbagging\" because of this. She went on to win the election and won a second term in 2006.\nWhen the war between the United States-led coalition and Iraq was about to start, she voted in favor of the war, which, as of 2015, she had said she regrets doing.\n2008 presidential campaign.\nHillary Clinton had raised more money than anybody else in the 2008 Presidential campaign, but later had big money problems for her campaign by May 7, 2008. She lost the party nomination to Barack Obama, but she campaigned for Obama after this.\nUnited States Secretary of State (2009-2013).\nIn mid-November 2008, Obama and Clinton talked about whether she could be the next U.S. Secretary of State in his presidency. On November 21, there were reports that said Hillary Clinton had accepted his offer.\nDuring her term as Secretary of State, Clinton used her position to make women's rights and human rights a focus of U.S. initiatives. She became one of the most traveled secretaries of state in American history. She promoted the use of social media to convey the country's positions. She also led U.S. diplomatic efforts in responding to the Arab Spring and military intervention in Libya.\nClinton did not want to serve a second term as secretary. Once Barack Obama won his re-election, he announced that John Kerry would succeed Clinton as secretary. Clinton left office on February 1, 2013.\n2016 presidential campaign.\nIn 2016, Clinton became the first woman in the History of the United States to be a major party presidential candidate. Clinton did not want to run for president in 2016, but after much of a majority support from the Democratic party, on April 12, 2015, speculation ended as Clinton formally announced her candidacy via email and the release of a video saying, \"Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion.\" In the polls, Clinton maintained her lead for the nomination although she faced several challenges from Senator Bernie Sanders. A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted in May found Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in a tie. Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates in the poll's history. This made it difficult for her campaign.\nClinton became the presumptive nominee on June 6, 2016.\nClinton lost the general election to Donald Trump winning 227 of the electoral college to Trump's 304. Clinton won the popular vote however 48% to Trump's 46%.\nAfter the 2016 election.\nIn April 2017, Clinton said that she will not seek public office again.\nPersonal life.\nWhile working as a faculty member at the Law School of the University of Arkansas, she married Bill Clinton on October 11, 1975. He was also working as a faculty member at the same university. Both knew each other and were classmates at the Yale Law School. Their only child is daughter Chelsea Clinton, born on February 27, 1980."}

{"id": "10779", "revid": "731605", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10779", "title": "Telugu", "text": "Telugu is an Indian language spoken in the southern part of India. It is the official language of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India. Telugu is the second most spoken language in India and 15th largest spoken language in the world. As it is one of the oldest languages in the world, Government of India gave it the status of a Classical language.\nAitereya Brahmanyam which is a part of Rigveda (literature dates to 7000 years before CE) written thousands years before CE, has mentioned Telugu. Telugu also finds mention in Rajatarangini, written by Bilhana Kavi. As per Hindu mythology, one of the sons of Bali Chakravarthy (the one who was sent to Pathaala by Vamana) is Andhra or Andhrudu. Telugu region i.e. Andhra or AP was ruled by him, long before the times of Ramayana and Mahabharata (literature is proven to be of the period 3000 years before CE).\nTelugu is the only language other than Sanskrit which has the linguistic prakriya (literature game) called Avadhana, which disappeared in other languages with the passage of time. Languages also have become more and more simple and adopted simple pronunciations, the reason for some typical sounds of Telugu being missing in many other languages.\nSri Krishnadeva Raya has said \"Desa bhashalandu Telugu Lessa\" which means \"Among the nation's languages, Telugu is the best.\" Being a mellifluous language, British authors in the 19th century called Telugu, Italian of the East. It is believed that Italian explorer Niccol\u00f2 Da Conti, who visited Vijayanagara empire during the reign of Vira Vijaya Bukka Raya in the fifteenth century, coined the phrase. \nAccording to linguists, Proto-Dravidian gave rise to 21 Dravidian languages. They can be broadly classified into three groups: Northern group, Central group, and Southern group of Dravidian languages. The central group consists of ten languages, out of which only Telugu became a civilized language and the rest of the nine languages remained tribal languages. Telugu is the most widely spoken language of the Dravidian family which consists of 24 languages spanning all of South Asia, from Baluchistan to Sri Lanka.\nIn India the history of scripts has been almost independent of the history of languages. The current similarity in scripts between Telugu and Kannada, which falls under the southern group of Proto-Dravidian languages along with Tamil, Malayalam, Tulu and others, has a lot more to do with the rule of the Chalukyas than the similarity between the languages.\nGeographic distribution.\nTelugu is mainly spoken in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Yanam district of Puducherry as well as in the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, some parts of Jharkhand and West Bengal in India. It is also spoken in the United States, where the Telugu diaspora numbers more than a million, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain, Canada, Fiji, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius, Ireland, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and many western European countries, where there is also a considerable Telugu diaspora. Telugu speakers abroad are often some of the wealthiest ethnic groups in the countries they go to due to their high educational attainment and intelligence; in the US, the average Telugu family makes $115,000 a year. In Tamil Nadu, about 6.3% of the population speak Telugu, where it commonly known as Telungu. It is the largest spoken and most dominant language in South India.\nPhonology.\nWith 56 letters [16 vowels and 36 consonants, 4 removed], Telugu has more letters in its alphabet than any other language.

The controllers of the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 are the same, but the PlayStation 3 is used wirelessly and doesn't have an analog button. Some games are online e.g. \"Call of Duty World at War Final Fronts\" and a few connect with the PlayStation Portable (or PSP). The PS2 is very successful and games are still made for it. The PlayStation 2 is the world's best-selling console. It has sold around 159 million units since its launch in March 2000, and is fully compatible with PlayStation (PS1) games. It competed with the Nintendo GameCube and the Microsoft Xbox during its lifetime. Even with the release of the PS3, the PS2 remained popular at the time of the seventh generation until Sony announced that they had discontinued the PlayStation 2 in Japan on December 28, 2012 and worldwide on January 4, 2013. The last two games for the system were \"FIFA 14\" and \"Pro Evolution Soccer 2014\" (released only in Europe) in late 2013 (a week before the PlayStation 4's release date). Both these games also had PS3 and PS4 versions. Online functionalities had ended on March 31, 2016. Repair for the system had ended in Japan on September 7, 2018.\nPSX.\nThe PSX was released in 2003. It was a video recorder that allowed you to play PlayStation 2 games. It had a built-in hard drive (up to 250 GB). It did not sell well, because it cost too much money, so it was not released outside of Japan. \"\" became the most sold game, with over 27.5 million copies sold."}

Among its most popular products is the video game console PlayStation, which was followed by PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and now the PlayStation 4. They also sold the Walkman invented by Andreas Pavel - a small music audio cassette player that could fit in your pocket - they later made Walkman systems that could play CDs, MiniDiscs or MP3s instead of tapes, and they often could receive radio too.\nThe company also makes music players, televisions, headsets, mobile phones (Sony Ericsson) and computers (named Sony Vaio), and game players (PlayStation).\nIt owns the American movie studios, Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures, through Sony Pictures.\nHistory.\nSony began its activity from a department store in Tokyo. At that time, 1946, the store was damaged by bombs. One engineer and one physicist invested a capital of about $1,600 to create a company which would include 20 employees. The name of the engineer was Masaru Ibuka and the name of the physicist was Akio Morita. People working in their new company repaired electrical equipment. Later they started creating their own products.\nThe company achieved success in 1954, when it received license that allowed producing transistors. Although transistors were already created in United States, they were not used in production of radios. Sony produced its first transistor radio in May of 1954.\nFrom that period Sony started leading in the field of electronics. Its revolutionary devices included: Trinitron Color Television, created in 1968; color video cassette, produced in 1971 as well as the world's second home video system, created in 1975. Other revolutionary inventions of Sony include: 1979 \u2013 Walkman; 1981 \u2013 Electronic camera; 1982 \u2013 CD player; 1983 \u2013 Camcorder and the list continuous with many other devices. One of the most popular Sony products was Sony PlayStation, created in 1995. With its help Sony became the leader in videogames.\nIn 45 years Sony has grown from a small firm, employing 20 workers, to a multinational corporation, employing about 100,000 workers. The company created its American branch in 1960 and its UK branch in 1968. In recent years the company focused on leadership in software and hardware. Sony acquired, in 1988, CBS Records and formed Sony Music Entertainment. A year later the company bought Columbia Pictures to create Sony Pictures Entertainment.\nSony would later join forces with BMG to form \"Sony BMG.\" BMG Music Publishing was sold to Universal in 2007. Sony bought all of BMG's record labels in 2008, ending the \"BMG\" name."}

It was released on November 16, 2005, 1462 days after the original Xbox. The Xbox 360 competes against the Nintendo Wii and Sony PlayStation 3. All three are called next-generation or seventh generation consoles. The Xbox 360 was officially revealed on MTV on May 12, 2005. The successor to the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, was announced on May 21, 2013. Even though the Xbox One was released on November 22, 2013, the Xbox 360 continued to be sold until April 20, 2016. However, games are no longer being made for the system.\nDevelopment.\nBefore Microsoft revealed the console's real name, it was called the Xbox 2, Xenon, Xbox Next, NextBox, and other names. During the development, Microsoft, said it would launch the High-Definition era for video game consoles, promising visuals looks that would look better and much more real. The Xbox 360 uses standard DVD's to play games and other media.\nRelease.\nThe Xbox 360 was released in the United States and Canada on November 22, 2005 in Europe on December 2, 2005, and in Japan on December 10, 2005. It was later launched in Malaysia, Mexico, Colombia, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, India, Brazil, Poland, Czech Republic, and Russia. When the console was first released in North America, demand was more than the supplies and the console sold out at many stores. Many people sold the console on eBay for higher prices, and it was not until early 2006 that the Xbox 360 became more available in stores again.\nAccessories.\nA number of accessories can be purchased for the Xbox 360. These include both wired and wireless controllers, custom faceplates that cover the front of the console, headsets for chatting while online,a webcam, a steering wheel for driving games and various other accessories.\nKinect is a major accessory that Microsoft is planning for the Xbox 360. It is a new way to control games without a controller. Kinect is being developed, and may be in stores in late 2010. It has already won many awards. When it was first being made, it was called Project Natal.\nSoftware.\nThe Xbox 360 is a multimedia console. It can play music and videos streamed or downloaded from a computer. It can also play DVDs and HD-DVDs if a HD-DVD Drive is connected. The Xbox 360 plays games on either a disc or on its hard drive. There are many games for Xbox 360.\nUpdates.\nThe NXE (New Xbox Experience) update had many new features. One new feature is an avatar system. You can make the avatar look like you. The avatar is used in games and more. The menus were changed too. The NXE shows your friends and what they are doing. Another new feature is the ability to add people to an Xbox Live Party. People can talk online in a party. It does not matter if you are on the dashboard or playing another game, up to seven of your friends or anyone else can join a party. Another option is to add friends to the party and game, which will invite them to both your game and party.\nXbox Live now has Facebook, Twitter, and Last.fm. You can use them on Xbox Live, but some features are different. 1080p High definition movies are also on Xbox Live. You can pay to download them.\nThe most recent update on the 360 was allowing users to input a USB memory device, allowing USB drives with memory over 1 GB to be used for storing data such as avatar items, or game saves, up to a maximum of 16 GB of data.\nRed Ring of Death.\nThe Xbox 360 Red Ring of death issue is very common on older consoles. When this happens, what is known as the Red Ring of Death (RRoD) appears: three of the four warning lights surrounding the power button on the console flash in red. The Red Ring of Death shows that there is a hardware problem, which usually means that the console no longer works. The white Arcade console breaks down a lot. On later models for example, the Xbox 360 S, these three lights show that there is an over-heating problem."}

They are prokaryotic microorganisms. Bacterial cells do not have a nucleus, and most have no organelles with membranes around them. Most have a cell wall. They do have DNA, and their biochemistry is basically the same as other living things. They are amongst the simplest and the oldest organisms. They function as independent organisms. \nAlmost all bacteria are so tiny they can only be seen through a microscope. Bacteria are made up of one cell, so they are a kind of \"unicellular organism\". They are among the simplest single-celled organisms on Earth, and were one of the earliest forms of life. They include a number of extremophiles which live in extreme habitats.\nThere are probably more individual bacteria than any other sort of organism on the planet. Most bacteria live in the ground or in water, but many live inside or on the skin of other organisms, including humans. There are about 1:1 bacterial cells as human cells in each of our bodies. Some bacteria can cause diseases, but others help us in everyday activities like digesting food (gut flora). Some even work for us in factories, producing cheese and yogurt.\nThe founder of bacteriology was a German biologist called Ferdinand Cohn (18281898). He published the first biological classification of bacteria, based on their appearance.\nReproduction and gene transfer.\nA bacterium reproduces (creates more bacteria) by dividing in half and creating two \"daughter\" cells. Each daughter is identical in shape to the parent, but is smaller.\nBacteria do not have sexes, but they do transmit DNA by several kinds of horizontal gene transfer. This is how they share resistance to antibiotics from one strain to another. The complete DNA sequence is known for many bacterial strains.\nEach bacterium has only one chromosome.\nShape.\nBacteria vary widely in size and shape, but in general they are at least ten times larger than viruses. A typical bacterium is about 1\u00a0\u00b5m (one micrometer) in diameter, so a thousand bacteria lined up would be one millimeter long. There are about five nonillion (5\u00d71030) bacteria on Earth.\nBacteria are identified and grouped by their shapes. Bacilli are rod-shaped, cocci are ball-shaped, spirilla are spiral-shaped, and vibrio are shaped like a comma or a boomerang.\nPathogens.\nPathogenic bacteria, the harmful kind, enter the human body from the air, water or food. Once inside, these bacteria attach themselves to or invade specific cells in our respiratory system, digestive tract or in any open wound. There they begin to reproduce and spread while using your body's food and nutrients to give them energy to help them reproduce.\nExtremophiles.\nSome bacteria are extremophiles. Some microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 meters below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometers of ocean off the Pacific Northwest of the United States. According to one of the researchers, \"You can find microbes everywhere \u2014 they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.\" \nHistory of their classification.\nAll modern ideas start with the sequence analysis of DNA and RNA. In 1987, Carl Woese, the forerunner of the molecular phylogeny revolution, divided bacteria into 11 divisions based on 16S ribosomal RNA (SSU) sequences:"}

{"id": "10896", "revid": "1055293", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10896", "title": "Poker", "text": "Poker is a game which people play with a normal set (or \"deck\") of 52 cards. Poker is a gambling game which involves some luck, but also some skill. In poker, players make bets against each other depending on the value of their poker hand. Bets are usually made with plastic or ceramic discs called \"chips\". Bets may also be made with real money, but chips are more often used because they are easier to handle and count. At the end of the game, players either swap their chips for money, or the chips are counted to determine the order of winners.\nThere are many different kinds of poker. In draw poker, each player is dealt five cards. A player can decide to throw away a number of these cards and then take (\"draw\") new cards to replace them.\nIn stud poker (for example, seven-card stud), some of each player's cards are laid (\"face-up\") on the table so that the other players can see them. In community card poker (for example, Texas hold 'em), players share some of their cards in the center of the table.\nHistory.\nThe history of poker is a matter of some debate. The name of the game likely descended from the French \"poque\", which descended from the German \"pochen\" ('to knock'), but it is not clear whether the origins of poker itself lie with the games bearing those names. It closely resembles the Persian game of \"as nas\", and may have been taught to French settlers in New Orleans by Persian sailors. It is commonly regarded as sharing ancestry with the Renaissance game of \"primero\" and the French \"brelan\". The English game \"brag\" (earlier bragg) clearly descended from \"brelan\" and incorporated bluffing (though the concept was known in other games by that time). It is quite possible that all of these earlier games influenced the development of poker as it exists now.\nEnglish actor Joseph Crowell reported that the game was played in New Orleans in 1829, with a deck of 20 cards, four players betting on which player's hand was the most valuable. Jonathan H. Green's book, \"An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling\" (G. B. Zieber, Philadelphia, 1843), described the spread of the game from there to the rest of the country by Mississippi riverboats, on which gambling was a common pastime.\nSoon after this spread, the full 52-card English deck was used, and the flush was introduced. During the American Civil War, many additions were made, including draw poker, stud poker (the five-card variant), and the straight. Further American developments followed, such as the wild card (around 1875), lowball and split-pot poker (around 1900), and community card poker games (around 1925). Spread of the game to other countries, particularly in Asia, is often attributed to the U.S. military.\nThe game and jargon of poker have become important parts of American culture and English culture. Such phrases as \"ace in the hole\", \"beats me\", \"blue chip\", \"call the bluff\", \"cash in\", \"pass the buck\", \"poker face\", \"stack up\", \"up the ante\", \"when the chips are down\", \"wild card\", and others are used in everyday conversation even by those unaware of their origins at the poker table.\nModern tournament play became popular in American casinos after the World Series of Poker began in 1970. It was also during that decade that the first serious strategy books appeared, notably \"The Theory of Poker\" by David Sklansky (), \"Super System\" by Doyle Brunson (), and \"The Book of Tells\" by Mike Caro ().\nPoker\u2019s popularity has experienced an unprecedented spike in recent years, largely due to the introduction of online poker and the invention of the hole-card camera which finally turned the game into a spectator sport. Viewers can now follow the action and drama of the game, and broadcasts of poker tournaments such as the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour have brought in huge audiences for cable and satellite TV distributors.\nGame play.\nThe game of poker is played in hundreds of variations, but the following overview of game play applies to most of them.\nDepending on the game rules, one or more players may be required to place an initial amount of money into the pot before the cards are dealt. These are called forced bets and come in three forms: antes, blinds, and bring-ins.\nLike most card games, the dealer shuffles the deck of cards. The deck is then cut, and the appropriate number of cards are dealt face-down to the players. In a casino a \"house\" dealer handles the cards for each hand, but a \"button\" (any small item used as a marker, also called a \"buck\") is rotated among the players to determine the order of dealing and betting in certain games. In a home game, the right to deal the cards typically rotates among the players clockwise, but a \"button\" may still be used.\nAfter the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands \"develop\" in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. During a round of betting, there will always be a \"current bet amount\", which is the total amount of money bet in this round by the player who bet last in this round. To keep better track of this, it is conventional for players to not place their bets directly into the pot (called \"splashing\" the pot), but rather place them in front of themselves toward the pot, until the betting round is over. When the round is over, the bets are then gathered into the pot.\nAfter the first betting round is completed (every participating player having called an equal amount), there may be more rounds in which more cards are dealt in various ways, followed by further rounds of betting (into the same central pot). At any time during the first or subsequent betting rounds, if one player makes a bet and all other players fold, the deal ends immediately, the single remaining player is awarded the pot, no cards are shown, no more rounds are dealt, and the next deal begins. This is what makes it possible to bluff.\nAt the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot.\nHands.\nThe following are poker hands, from best to worst:\nPoker Chips.\nPoker chips are small disks. They made by various materials including molded plastic, colored metal \u00a0molded clays. They are used in table games as play money. Modern poker traces its roots towards the 1800s, and in those days, players used what you could to help keep a tally. Coins, gold dust and nuggets were used until they considered replacing with something which would indicate them. Thus, the casino chips happen to be introduced within the gambling business.\nPoker rooms started using casino chips to simply manage the cash and then collect charges. In those days, casino chips were created of ivory, bone, paper \u00a0wood. However, the most generally used chips were created of composite clay. One problem made an appearance due to the developing casino chips which was cheating. Some players considered sneaking some chips in their hands.

The country's capital and largest city is San Salvador. Other important cities are: Santa Ana and Sonsonate. El Salvador borders the Pacific Ocean on the south, and the countries of Guatemala to the west and Honduras to the north and east.\nBackground.\nIn 2010 El Salvador ranked in the top 10 Latin American countries in terms of Human Development Index. It was in the top 3 in Central America (behind Costa Rica and Panama). Also, tropical forests and overall forests have expanded by nearly 20% from the year 1992 to 2010, making it one of the few countries experiencing reforestation.\nIn El Salvador there are only two seasons. The dry season starts in mid-October and it lasts until mid May. During the dry season, it hardly ever rains. The wet season starts in mid-May and ends in mid-October. In this season it rains every day. The dry season is called summer and the rainy season is called winter.\nMost of the population is mestizo, a mixture of European and American people.\nIn June 2021, it became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin a legal tender. Three months later, the country began accepting Bitcoin as an official currency, making it the first country to do so.\nHistory.\nThe civilization of El Salvador began around 1500 B.C., leaving an evidence that would be the Tazumal Ruins and Chalchuapa Ruins. The first habitants were Pocomanes, Lencas and Pipiles; they stayed in the middle and east zone of El Salvador until about the eleventh century. The Spaniard Andr\u00e9s Ni\u00f1o led an expedition from Central America and arrived in Meanguera Island in the Gulf of Fonseca on May 31, 1522. That was the first Salvadoran territory visited by Spaniard men.\nIn June of 1524, Pedro de Alvarado began a war of conquest against Cuzcatl\u00e1n (Land of beautiful things) that was populated by native tribes of the country. During 17 days of bloody battles many natives and Spaniard men died, including the native Atlacatl. Pedro de Alvarado, deterred and injured, left the battle and set off to Guatemala, leaving his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the conquest of Cuzcatlan. After this, their cousin, Diego de Alvardo established the San Salvador Ville on April 1525 in a site named La Bermuda, near Suchitoto City. In 1546, Carlos I from Spain named San Salvador a city.\nDuring the following years, the country grew under Spaniard control. In 1810 a feeling of freedom formed between the countries of Central America. On the morning of November 5th, 1811, the priest Jos\u00e9 Mat\u00edas Delgado rang the bells of La Merced Church in San Salvador, calling for an uprising. After many internal conflicts, the Declaration of Independence of Central Am\u00e9rica was signed in Guatemala on September 15th, 1821. That day is the Independence day all around Central America.\nGeography.\nEl Salvador has a total area of . As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is sometimes called \"Pulgarcito de America\" (the \"Tom Thumb of the Americas\"). The highest point in El Salvador is Cerro El Pital, at , on the border with Honduras.\nEl Salvador has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes. Two of them, San Miguel and Izalco, have been active in recent years.\nEl Salvador has over 300 rivers. The most important is the Rio Lempa. Important lakes are Lake Ilopango (70\u00a0km\u00b2) and Lake Coatepeque (26\u00a0km\u00b2).\nFlora and Fauna.\nThere are eight species of sea turtles in the world. Of these six nest on the coasts of Central America, and four make their home on the Salvadoran coast: the leatherback turtle, the hawksbill, the Galapagos green turtle and the olive ridley sea turtle.\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\nThere are 4 national parks in El Salvador: El Imposible, Los Volcanes, Montecristo, and San Diego y San Felipe Las Barras.\nDepartments.\nEl Salvador is divided into 14 departments (\"departamentos\"). These are divided into 262 municipalities (\"municipios\").\nDepartment names and abbreviations for the 14 Salvadoran Departments:"}

In Europe, people usually grew the woodland strawberry. Dutch people learned how to eat them through most of the year by planting their seeds at different times, letting them harvest for 9 months out of 12. The Alpine strawberry became popular around the 1650s because it was a little bigger and could grow in places with less strong sunlight, like the British islands in the late fall. Today's bigger \"garden\" strawberry was first made around Brest in Brittany (northwest France) in the 1750s. It was made by joining the Virginia strawberry from eastern North America to the European Hautbois and the Chilean strawberry from western South America.\nKinds.\nThe species of the genus \" are:\nFruit.\nThe real fruit of the strawberries are the achenes, which people usually think of as the little seeds around the outside of the larger red \"fruit\".

Someone who has a job looking after forests is called a forester.\nForests are very important for the world today. Much of the water cycle and carbon cycle goes through forests.

Foresters also make sure the forest is in good condition for people to use. They makes sure that forests are not destroyed by wildfires before they are ready to use for timber production (cutting down trees to use the wood). \nForests are important for recreation (letting people enjoy them). They are very important today because humans produce a lot of carbon dioxide and the trees in forests help to turn this back into oxygen, which we breathe to live. Foresters also help the government figure out what to do about artificial forestry. Many universities offer forestry courses. Forestry students also study zoology, botany and ecology."}

The first, the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), was founded in 2001, but folded due to large debts after the 2003 season. The second, Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), was effectively a successor to WUSA, although it did not begin until 2009. Like WUSA before it, WPS played three seasons, but also lost large amounts of money; it first decided not to play its planned 2012 season, and then completely folded in May of that year.\nAfter WPS folded, the effective top level of women's soccer in the U.S. was WPSL Elite, a \"semi-pro\" league that had both professional and amateur teams. WPSL Elite was created by the Women's Premier Soccer League, one of two second-division women's leagues, as an outlet for former WPS teams, as well as WPSL teams that wanted to play professionally.

Salem is the capital (where most of the state government works), and Portland is the city with the most people. Oregon was the 33rd state to join the United States, in 1859.\nGeography.\nThe state of Washington is to the north of Oregon. California and Nevada are to the south. Idaho is to the east. The Pacific Ocean is to the west.\nThe Columbia River flows along most of the border with Washington. The Snake River flows along much of the border with Idaho. The highest mountain is Mount Hood ( high), part of the Cascade Range of mountains. Another famous Cascade Mountain in Oregon is Mount Mazama, better known as Crater Lake.\nHistory.\nOregon was a long way from the United States of America, which was east of the Mississippi river in the 1830s and 1840s. To get to Oregon, settlers had to cross the Great Plains, which were empty except for a few forts and groups of Native Americans. Most people thought that it was impossible to farm there. They called it the \"Great American Desert\", because crossing it was long and dangerous; however, thousands did anyway.\nMountain men (people who knew a lot about living in mountainous places) had found a passway over the Rocky Mountains, and they named it the South Pass. This path helped many wagons to reach the west coast. In 1836 a missionary named Marcus Whitman crossed through the pass with his wife to Oregon. This proved that it was possible for others with women and families to go too, and because of this, Oregon suddenly became the place pioneers wanted to make a trip to.\nMost of the settlers that came by the Oregon Trail had a very difficult trip. The Trail began in Missouri, and they went in covered wagons pulled by animals like bulls. They could only travel 100 miles in one week, and so the whole trip would take half a year. But still, lots of pioneers traveled so much that it is still possible to see the wagon ruts in some places today.\nLife on the trail was very hard for the pioneers. Every day, they would break up and camp, travel all day, and set up camp again. Food was usually beans and coffee, for every single day of the trip. The travelers always searched for water, wood for fires, and something to catch and eat fresh. But these were hard to find, and so sometimes they got mad at each other and fought with fists and guns.\nThe Trail was also dangerous. Rivers could flood, washing away people and other things. Native Americans could attack, oxen or horses could die, and diseases and injuries could strike.\nBy 1840, due to all the hard work of the pioneers, there were thousands of Americans in Oregon. Towns and farms had been set up. The area was part of British North America at the time. But the British, however, only had a few hundred settlers in Oregon. Because of this, the Americans began to plan to take over the whole land.\nMany Americans wanted this as well. They made up the slogan, \"Fifty-four Forty or Fight!\" and wanted all of Oregon up to latitude 54 or they would go to war with Britain to get it. They were so eager to have Oregon all for themselves, they supported James Polk as president because he claimed to have similar thoughts with them as well.\nHowever, after President Polk was elected, he began to be more sensible. He did not want to wage war with Britain, if it could be avoided. The British also realized that the Americans would soon have enough settlers in Oregon to easily drive out the British defenders. In 1846 the British offered to divide Oregon by giving most of the border land between the USA and what is now Canada. President Polk accepted this, and so now the Americans had power over Oregon as well as the other states.\nEducation.\nThere are a number of colleges and universities in Oregon. The four-year universities with the most students are Portland State University, Oregon State University, and the University of Oregon."}

Its capital and largest city is Little Rock. It has been estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015 that around 2,978,204 people live in Arkansas.\nHistory.\nArkansas became the 25th state to enter the Union in 1836. During the American Civil War, Arkansas was one of the Confederate states, however, it was the second state to be put back in to the U.S. in the Reconstruction. Native Americans first settled in the state before the arrival of Europeans. African American slaves were imported to Arkansas for slavery.\nGeography.\nArkansas borders Louisiana to the south, Texas to the southwest, Oklahoma to the west, Missouri to the north, and Tennessee and Mississippi on the east. The United States Census Bureau classifies Arkansas as a southern state. The Mississippi River forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in Clay and Greene counties. There the St. Francis River forms the western boundary of the Missouri Bootheel.\nArkansas has many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Arkansas has few natural lakes but many reservoirs such as Bull Shoals Lake, Lake Ouachita, Greers Ferry Lake, Millwood Lake, Beaver Lake, Norfork Lake, DeGray Lake, and Lake Conway.\nArkansas is home to many caves, such as Blanchard Springs Caverns. More than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool making sites have been catalogued by the State Archeologist. Arkansas is currently the only U.S. state in which diamonds are mined. This is done by members of the public with primitive digging tools for a small daily fee, not by commercial interests.\nArkansas is home to a bunch of Wilderness Areas totaling around . These areas are set aside for outdoor recreation and are open to hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping. No vehicles are allowed in these areas.\nReligion.\nArkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the Bible Belt. It is mostly Protestant. The largest denominations by number of followers in 2000 were the Southern Baptist Convention with 665,307; the United Methodist Church with 179,383; the Roman Catholic Church with 115,967; and the American Baptist Association with 115,916.\nEducation.\nEducation in Arkansas has been an issue. Part of the problem has been low teacher salaries and small budgets for spending on students. Other problems have been not wanting to integrate, and poor school facilities.\nArkansas has two university systems: Arkansas State University System and University of Arkansas System. Some other public institutions are Arkansas Tech University, Henderson State University, Southern Arkansas University, and University of Central Arkansas. It is also home to 11 private colleges and universities. One of them being Hendrix College, one of the nation's top 100 liberal arts colleges, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.\nCulture.\nArkansas is notable for its bauxite mines. Arkansas was also the first U.S. state where diamonds were found. Notable Arkansans include Bill Clinton, who was governor of Arkansas before he became the President of the United States, Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, Johnny Cash, a famous guitarist known as \"The Man In Black\", and Rodger Bumpass, Who voices Squidward Tentacles on the Nickelodeon show SpongeBob SquarePants.\nAttractions.\nArkansas is home to many areas protected by the National Park System.

He was part of the Capetian dynasty and the first king of the Bourbon family in France.\nLife.\nHenry IV was born in Pau. He was the son of Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne of Navarre. He was baptised in a Catholic ceremony, but as he grew up, his mother led him to become a Protestant. On 18 August 1572, Henry married Margaret of Valois. She was the sister of Charles IX. He became the King of Navarre in the same year.\nSince 1562, there had been a a series of wars in France which were mostly fought between Catholics and Protestants, and sometimes with more than one groups of Catholics fighting each other. In 1584, Henry became the heir to the throne of France. Most people in France were Catholics, and many of them did not want a Protestant king. This led to the War of the Three Henrys between Henry of Navarre, the existing Catholic king Henry III and Catholic League leader Henry, Duke of Guise. Although both Henry III and Guise were Catholics, they did not get on with each other. Guise was murdered in 1588 and Henry III was murdered the following year.\nHenry of Navarre could now be crowned King of France, but he still faced opposition from the Catholic League. After four years of fighting, he decided to convert to being Catholic. He supposedly said \"Paris is well worth a Mass.\" After this, the opposition to Henry died down. In 1598, Henry made the Edict of Nantes. This law allowed people in France to be Protestant, even though most people were Catholic. In Europe at the time, a policy like this was unusual. Most countries forced people to be either Catholic or Protestant. However, the Edict did not make the Protestants fully equal.\nHenry's children were Louis XIII and Henrietta Maria of France, who married Charles I and became the Queen of England. He was a friend of Michel of Montaigne.\nDuring his reign, he built the Grande Galerie onto the Louvre. Two landmarks in Paris were started during his reign: the Pont Neuf and the Place des Vosges.\nHenry was murdered by a Catholic fanatic on a street in Paris on 14 May 1610.\nReputation.\nAt first, many people in France did not want Henry to be king, because he was a Protestant. Although this mostly ended once he joined the Catholic Church, some Catholics called him a liar, while some Protestants called him a traitor. It was only after his death that he became known as \"Good King Henry\" (in French, \"le bon roi Henri\") and one of France's most popular kings. During the early years of the French Revolution, Henry IV was celebrated as an example of what a king should be. He was also celebrated during the Bourbon Restoration.\nHenry IV is remembered for being the king who ended the French Wars of Religion, and for his policy of allowing more than one church in his country, which was unusual in those days. He was also known for trying to make sure that poor people had enough to eat. He once said he wished that there could be \"a chicken in every pot on a Sunday.\"\nIn 2010 scientists found part of his embalmed head and used forensic tests to prove that it was his. It had been stolen from the tombs of the French kings and queens in Saint Denis in 1793 at the time of the French Revolution."}

She was the oldest daughter of Henry VIII, and the only child of Catherine of Aragon who survived childhood. \nMary succeeded her short-lived half-brother, Edward VI, to the English throne. She was the fourth crowned monarch of the Tudor dynasty. Mary is remembered for briefly re-making England a Roman Catholic country. \nMary had almost 300 disagreeing religious people burned at the stake, which are recorded in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Due to this, many called her \"Bloody Mary\". Her half sister on her fathers side, Elizabeth I, came to the throne after Mary's death. Elizabeth made England Protestant again and didn't kill as many people.\nLife.\nMary Tudor was born on 18 February 1516, in the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich. Unlike the other children of Catherine, she lived to be an adult. Her godfather was the famous Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.\nAlthough she was not the heir Henry VIII was looking forward to, she was loved by her parents. When she was about 11, Henry decided to divorce Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon, so he could marry Anne Boleyn.\nAfter Anne Boleyn had a daughter, Henry VlII distrusted Mary and thought that her behavior came from her mother. So he purposefully separated Mary and Catherine of Aragon. He also banished them both from court and he removed Mary from the line of succession. Mary had to become one of her servants. After Anne Boleyn was killed by the King, Mary's half-sister also became a servant. A month later, Henry VIII married Jane Seymour. Queen Jane gave birth to Edward, Prince of Wales. 12 days later, Queen Jane died. \nMary lost a faithful friend and also her pride. She had acknowledged her parents' marriage as invalid and herself an illegitimate daughter. The rest of Mary's life with Henry VIII gave her a quick succession of stepmothers. Henry VIII died soon after marrying his last wife, Catherine Parr. \nHenry had decided that the young prince was to succeed him. If he had no heirs then his older half-sister, Mary, was to be Queen. \nIf Mary did not produce a child, then Mary's half-sister, Elizabeth, was to be Queen. After Elizabeth and her heirs, would come Henry's sister Mary Tudor's side of the family.\nEdward succeeded to the throne as King of England and Ireland. Edward began to show signs of a coughing disease.\nEdward did not want Mary to succeed him. Edward went ahead with a plan to let his Protestant cousin Lady Jane Grey become Queen after he died. Lady Jane Grey was only queen of England for nine days. Mary executed Jane Grey and married Philip II of Spain. \nMary had two phantom pregnancies, but had no child. The phantom pregnancies were cancer in her liver. After Mary died Elizabeth succeeded to the throne, becoming the new Queen Elizabeth I of England."}

His mother died 12 days after his birth. He became king at the age of 9 when his father died. Although he had two older sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, Edward was the next in line for the throne because he was male. Because he was such a young king, the country was governed by nobles. He had two advisors (or regents). The first was his uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, who became Lord Protector. For the first two-and-a-half years of Edward's reign, Lord Somerset advised and guided the young king. Somerset was then replaced by John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland.\nEdward was the first Protestant king of England. Although his father, Henry VIII, had broken the Church of England away from the Roman Catholic Church, he had not changed much else. Most of the major changes to the Church of England happened during Edward's reign. They were led by Somerset, Northumberland and Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. Also during his reign, England tried to take over Scotland. After a good start, it ended in defeat. His reign also saw economic problems and unrest.\nHe died when he was 15 and a half years old, probably from tuberculosis. Before he died, Edward named his cousin, Lady Jane Grey, as his heir and excluded his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. He was trying to prevent Mary, a Catholic, from returning the country to Catholicism. However, Mary overthrew Jane less than two weeks later and became the queen. Mary undid the reforms of Edward's reign, but Elizabeth restored them in 1559.\nReligious changes.\nLaws were passed to make churches more plain. Catholic churches were rich in decorations and colour. Now under Edward, stained glass windows and icons were removed from churches; the furniture within churches became very basic and plain.\nThe actual services became more plain and the common person could now understand what was being said at services \u2013 now called Holy Communion \u2013 were in English rather than Latin. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer wrote the Book of Common Prayer also in English. Priests did not have to dress in the bright clothing associated with the Catholic Church and under Edward. They were also allowed to marry. The king remained as Head of the Church.\nAll of these changes were a major break from the traditions of the Catholic Church. In parts of Germany and Switzerland, religious groups had also broken away in protest against the wealth and corruption of the Catholic Church. They became known as Protestant, and England under Edward, became a Protestant country with an independent Church of England.\nEdward had never been a healthy boy and his health failed in 1553. After the nine-day reign of Lady Jane Grey, his Catholic half-sister Mary became queen of England and the country went through another period of religious changes."}

He is sometimes called Richard the Lionheart. Richard was the son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. As the third son and not expected to inherit the throne, he was a replacement child. In 1168 he became Duke of Aquitaine.\nRichard was one of the leaders of the Third Crusade against Saladin, which never actually succeeded. During his journey, he conquered Sicily and Cyprus. He fought in the Battle of Acre and the Battle of Arsuf. In the end, as he was unable to win back Jerusalem from the Muslims, he decided to return home to England. On his way back from the Crusade, Richard was captured by the Austrian Duke, Leopold I. The English people had to pay a huge ransom to set him free. He was considered a very brave and noble king, but he did not spend a lot of time in England - only six months of his eleven-year reign were spent in his country.\nHe died after being shot with a crossbow while besieging a castle in Limousin. His remains were buried at different places. His body was buried at Fontevraud Abbey near Saumur in France, as are his father and mother. His internal organs were buried at Ch\u00e2lus, (at \"The Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol\"), near Limoges in central France. His heart was buried in the Notre Dame Cathedral at Rouen. It was found in 1838 and was examined by scientists in 2012. They did tests for poisons, as one medieval story claimed Richard had died from a poisoned arrow. There is no evidence to support this idea, and he probably died from gangrene or septicaemia from the arrow wound.\nRichard was succeeded by his younger brother, John.\nLegacy.\nKing Richard I of England left an indelible imprint on the imagination extending to the present, in large part because of his military exploits and his popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence. Contemporaries considered Richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess, this was apparently the first instance of such a combination. He was known as a valiant, competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous. Victorian England admired King Richard I as a crusader and a man of God, erecting a heroic statue of him outside the Westminster Palace. \nKing Richard I of England was seen as a pious hero by his subjects, he remains one of the few kings of England remembered by his epithet, rather than regnal number and he is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France."}

She was the mother of Edward VI of England, who died at the age of 15. Edward was the only male child of King Henry VIII to survive infancy.\nBiography.\nJane Seymour was the child of John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth. She was not educated as much as King Henry's wives before her, for example, Catherine of Aragon or Anne Boleyn. She could read and write a little, but was much better at needlework and managing the house. These were considered much more necessary for women. Jane's needlework was said to be beautiful and complex. Some of her work was kept till 1652, where it is recorded to have been given to the Seymour family. After her death, it was noted that Henry was an \"enthusiastic embroiderer\". \nShe was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII. When Henry divorced his first wife and married Anne Boleyn, Jane continued to be a lady-in-waiting. Henry VIII noticed Jane at court and had already fallen in love with her by the time Anne Boleyn was executed. He became engaged to Jane on the day after the execution, and they were married ten days later, on May 30, 1536. When Jane became queen, she ran the royal court in a strict and formal way, and her only close friends were Anne Stanhope and Elizabeth Seymour. \nIn early 1537, Jane became pregnant and developed a craving for quail. In October 1537, she gave birth to the son that Henry VIII wanted so much. They named him Edward, and he was later to be King Edward VI of England. Soon, Jane became very ill with fever, and she died on October 24, 1537. Jane never had a coronation, and was married to Henry for only a year and a half before she died (May 30, 1536-October 24, 1537). Henry had loved Jane the most of all his wives, because she was the one who gave him a son. Even though he was married another three times after Jane's death, he always grieved for her. Before Henry died, he asked to be buried next to Jane."}

Catherine was the wife of Arthur, Prince of Wales and later married his brother, Henry VIII.\nEarly life.\nWhen Catherine was three years old, it was decided that she would marry Arthur, Prince of Wales. Catherine and Arthur were married on 14 November 1501. They were sent to Ludlow Castle in Shropshire, to take control of the Council of Wales. Months later, Catherine and Arthur became ill, possibly from a sickness which was sweeping the area at the time. Prince Arthur died on 2 April 1502, leaving after Catherine a widow at the age of 16.\nHenry VIII married Catherine in 1509, shortly after he became king. She was extremely popular with the people of England. In 1513, when Henry VIII invaded France, she ruled as his regent.\nAnnulment: end of marriage.\nDespite Catherine's popularity, she did not produce a surviving son. Her only surviving child was a daughter, Mary I of England. Henry's need for a son caused him to try and divorce his wife.\nAt first, Henry tried to convince Anne Boleyn to be his mistress in 1527. Anne refused, so Henry decided to marry her. Divorce was not allowed in the Catholic faith. Henry claimed that, as Catherine had been married to his elder brother Arthur, his was an invalid marriage. He quoted a verse in Leviticus which states that \"a man may not marry his brother's wife and such a union would be without the blessing of God and fruitless\", and used this as his case. It became referred to as the kings \"Great Matter\" and a special court was held with Cardinal Wolsey leading it.\nAn official from Rome was brought over and a trial was held. The official stated that he could not come to a conclusion and the case would have to be referred to Rome for the Pope to make a decision. The matter dragged on for quite some time, as the Pope would not agree to an annulment.\nLater years.\nIn 1532, Anne Boleyn became pregnant with the king's child. She was married to Henry on 25 January 1533 so that the baby could be a legitimate heir. Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon was finally annulled in the following May by Archbishop Cranmer, thus ending the first of Henry's 6 marriages. The divorce went against the Roman Catholic belief system, so Henry created his own church, the Church of England. This was the beginnings of protestantism in England, with the King as the head of the church instead of the Pope.\nUntil the end of Catherine's life, Catherine believed that she was the true wife of Henry VIII. Her servants called her their queen, but Henry called her the \"Dowager Princess of Wales\".\nIn 1535, Catherine was transferred to Kimbolton Castle and was not allowed to see her daughter Mary. Henry VIII told her that until they declared Anne their queen, they would be able to see each other. They never did.\nCatherine died, most likely of heart cancer, in January of 1536, just five months before the execution of Anne Boleyn."}

Its capital and largest city is Denver. Other large cities are Colorado Springs and Aurora. Colorado became the 38th state admitted to the union on August 1, 1876.\nHistory.\nNative Americans first settled in Colorado. The prominent Colorado Native Americans are the Navajo, Ute, and Cheyenne-Arapahoe Indians. The state was named after the Colorado River by Spanish explorers. US Army officer and amateur explorer Zebulon Pike was recruited by the United States government in 1806 to find the source of the Mississippi River and to check out Spanish settlements in New Mexico. Even though his recorded location for the source of the Mississippi was extremely inaccurate and allegedly got lost in his expedition, he did explore much of what would become the American Southwest. When he reached what is now Colorado Springs, he named a mountain after himself, Pikes Peak, which remains a symbol for the city as well as the state to this day. Colorado has a long history of mining and digging for gold. It is the place where the Pike's Peak Gold Rush took place. When gold in California was becoming harder and harder to find, people came to Colorado in large numbers when gold was discovered there in 1859, ten years after the California Gold Rush began. Many mining camps set up in Colorado would later become cities, such as Denver City and Boulder City. The motto for the gold rush was \"Pike's Peak or Bust\". In 1971, the Libertarian Party was formed in the state.\nGeography.\nThe State of Colorado is shaped like a rectangle. The borders are latitude and longitude lines. The four borders are at 37\u00b0N, 41\u00b0N, 102\u00b003'W, and 109\u00b003'W. (The east and west borders are 25\u00b0W and 32\u00b0W from the Washington Meridian.) Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah are the only three U.S. states that have only lines of latitude and longitude for boundaries and that have no natural borders. When government surveyors made the border markers for the \"Territory of Colorado\", minor surveying mistakes made many small kinks along the borders, most seen along the border with the \"Territory of Utah.\"\nThe tip of Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,401\u00a0m) elevation in Lake County is the state's highest point and the highest point in the entire Rocky Mountains. Colorado has more than 100 mountain peaks that reach over 4,000 meters (13,123\u00a0ft) in height. Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies entirely above 1,000\u00a0meters (3,281\u00a0ft) in height. Colorado has the highest average elevation of any state at 6,800\u00a0ft. It borders New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming.\nThe land area of Colorado is roughly the same size as New Zealand.\nClimate.\nThe weather and temperatures in Colorado are quite different compared to most of the United States. In most other states, the southern part is warmer than the northern part, southern Colorado is not noticeably warmer than northern Colorado. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate. As a normal rule, with an increase in height comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in rain. There exists a phenomenally severe change in climate in Colorado between the Rocky Mountains on the west and the Great Plains on the east, both of which are separated by a lesser range known to Colorado citizens and primarily Boulderites as \"the Foothills\".\nPopulation.\nThe state's largest city, and capital, is Denver. The \"Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area\", is home to 2,927,911 people, it has more than two-thirds of the state's population.\nAs of 2005, Colorado has an estimated population of 4,665,177, which is an increase of 63,356, or 1.4%, from the last year and an increase of 363,162, or 8.4%, since the year 2000. This has a natural increase since the last census of 205,321 people (that is 353,091 births minus 147,770 deaths) and an increase because of migration of 159,957 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States makes a net increase of 112,217 people, and migration within the country made a net increase of 47,740 people.\nReligion.\nColorado's most common religion is Christianity, and its most common denomination is Catholicism. Colorado, and mostly the city of Colorado Springs, serves as the headquarters of many Christian groups, many of them Evangelical. \"Focus on the Family\" is a big conservative Christian organization headquartered in Colorado Springs.\nMajor religious affiliations of the people of Colorado are:\nEconomy.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the total state product in 2007 was $236 billion. Per capita personal income in 2007 was $41,192, ranking Colorado eleventh in the United States. Early companies were based on the extraction and getting minerals and agricultural things. Today's agricultural things are cattle, wheat, dairy products, corn, and hay. On January 1 2014 Colorado became the first state to make marijuana legal. In the first week of this $5 million of marijuana was sold. The marijuana industry is expected to make Colorado's economy $359 million by the end of 2014."}

Some might think that at absolute zero particles lose all energy and stop moving. This is not correct. In quantum physics there is something called zero point energy, which means that even after all the energy from particles has been removed, the particles still have some energy. This is due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which states that the more that is known about a particle's position, the less that can be known about its momentum, and vice versa. Therefore, a particle cannot be completely stopped because then its exact position and momentum would be known. \nSome people have created temperatures very close to absolute zero: the record temperature was 100 pK (one hundred picokelvin, equal to 10\u221210 kelvin) above absolute zero. Even getting close to absolute zero is difficult because anything that touches an object being cooled near absolute zero would give heat to the objects. Scientists use lasers to slow atoms when cooling objects to very low temperatures.\nThe kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvin (K) or 0 degrees Rankine (\u00b0R). The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is \u2212273.15\u00a0\u00b0C or \u2212459.67\u00a0\u00b0F.\nAt this stage the pressure of the particles is zero. If we plot a graph to it, we can see that the temperature of the particles is zero. The temperature cannot go down any further. Also, the particles cannot move in \"reverse\" either because as the movement of particles is vibration, vibrating in reverse would be nothing but simply vibrating again. The closer the temperature of an object gets to absolute zero, the less resistive the material is to electricity therefore it will conduct electricity almost perfectly, with no measurable resistance.\nThe Third Law of Thermodynamics says that nothing can ever have a temperature of absolute zero.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics says that all engines that are powered by heat (like car engines and steam train engines) must release waste heat and can not be 100% efficient. This is because the efficiency (percent of energy the engine uses up that is actually used to do the engine's job) is 100%\u00d7(1-Toutside/Tinside), which only is 100% if the outside temperature is absolute zero which it cannot be. So, an engine cannot be 100% efficient, but you can make its efficiency closer to 100% by making the inside temperature hotter and/or the outside temperature colder."}

The shape can be thought of as a circular prism. Both the surface and the solid shape created inside can be called a \"cylinder\". The surface area and the volume of a cylinder have been known since ancient times.\nIn differential geometry, a cylinder is defined more broadly as a ruled surface which is spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines. A cylinder whose cross section is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder, parabolic cylinder, or hyperbolic cylinder respectively.\nCommon use.\nIn common use a \"cylinder\" is taken to mean a finite section of a right circular cylinder, i.e., the cylinder with the generating lines perpendicular to the bases, with its ends closed to form two circular surfaces, as in the figure (right). If the cylinder has a radius and length (height) \"h\", then its volume is given by:\nand its surface area is:\nTherefore, without the top or bottom (lateral area), the surface area is:\nWith the top and bottom, the surface area is:\nFor a given volume, the cylinder with the smallest surface area has .

For a right circular cylinder, there are four possibilities. A plane tangent to the cylinder, meets the cylinder in a single straight line. Moved while parallel to itself, the plane either does not intersect the cylinder or intersects it in two parallel lines. All other planes intersect the cylinder in an ellipse or, when they are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, in a circle.\nOther types of cylinders.\nAn elliptic cylinder, or cylindroid, is a quadric surface, with the following equation in Cartesian coordinates:\nThis equation is for an elliptic cylinder, a generalization of the ordinary, circular cylinder (). Even more general is the generalized cylinder: the cross-section can be any curve.\nThe cylinder is a \"degenerate quadric\" because at least one of the coordinates (in this case ) does not appear in the equation.\nAn oblique cylinder has the top and bottom surfaces displaced from one another.\nThere are other more unusual types of cylinders.

She was the tenth child of Lord Edmund Howard and Joyce Culpepper. Her father was the second son of the Duke of Norfolk. She was a cousin to Anne Boleyn, who was the second wife of Henry VIII.\nCatherine's family was poor so they sent her to live with her step-grandmother, Agnes Tilney. Agnes Tilney, the Duchess of Norfolk, had a large household, but it was not very strict. Catherine could read and write, but she was the least-educated of Henry VIII's wives.\nArrival at court.\nCatherine became a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne of Cleves in 1539 or 1540, when she was about 18 years old. Anne of Cleves was the fourth wife of Henry VIII. The king did not like Anne, and said she was not as pretty as he had hoped for and also called her a Flanders mare (horse). He soon fell in love with Catherine.\nIn July 1540, after Henry had annulled his marriage with Anne of Cleves, Henry and Catherine got married at Oatlands Palace, which is in Surrey.\nMarriage.\nHenry VIII loved his young bride and gave her lots of rich presents, such as jewels and expensive clothes. He called her his 'rose without a thorn' and the 'very jewel of womanhood'. Her motto was \"Non autre volont\u00e9 que la sienne\" (French) or \"No other wish but his\". However, Catherine was not happy in her marriage. Her husband was very fat (he was about at the time), much older than she was, and had an ulcer on his legs. She started becoming acquainted with a man named Thomas Culpepper.\nDownfall.\nRumors that Catherine was unfaithful began to be repeated at court. Then Francis Dereham told\npeople about the affair which he had had with Catherine, and officials started to ask questions about what she was doing in private. Many of Catherine's ladies-in-waiting, who had also lived with her in Lambeth, were brought forward to bring evidence against Catherine. Soon, her past was uncovered, and more scandal was brought to her name; enough to have her charged with treason. Catherine then, in 1541, was arrested and charged with high treason. Henry was heartbroken and very upset. He drew his sword and threatened to kill Katherine himself. At last, he made up his mind that Catherine was to be executed, just like her cousin, Anne Boleyn.\nDeath.\nIn February of 1542, Catherine was told that she was to die. She was being kept a prisoner at Syon Abbey. She was so fearful she grew filled with hysteria, crying as if she was a madwoman. She asked to see the executioner's block so she might know how to put her head on it. She practiced laying her head on the block all night long before her death.\nThere is a popular story that before Catherine died, she said, \"I die a Queen, but I would rather have died the wife of Culpepper.\" This story is not true. Instead, she cried out \"God have mercy on my soul. Good people, I beg of you, pray for me.\"\nThe executioner chopped her head off with one blow. She was buried in St. Peter Ad Vincula, the parish church of the Tower of London."}

She was born in D\u00fcsseldorf on 22 September 1515.\nShe was betrothed to Francis, the Duke of Lorraine, but she ended up marrying Henry VIII in January of 1540. When the couple met for the first time, they did not like each other.\nHenry VIII got married six times. Except for Anne of Cleves, Henry knew all of his wives for a long time before marrying them. Henry decided to marry Anne so England and the Protestant League would be allies. It was a political marriage. Henry also knew that having more than one son would be good, in case his and Jane Seymour's son, Edward, died. So he also married Anne so he could have more children.\nHans Holbein painted a beautiful picture of Anne of Cleves and showed it to Henry. One of the reasons Henry decided to marry Anne (instead of her sister Amelia) was because she looked so beautiful in her portrait. When Anne's ship landed in England, Henry decided to sneak out to meet her early. He brought a few of his friends and servants with him. Henry dressed in the exact same clothes as the servants, and they all came into the room where Anne was waiting with her women. Henry was acting out a story from the tradition of courtly love in which a man goes to see a woman while he is disguised as a servant, and she recognizes him because of the magic of true love. Almost everyone in the courts of England and France knew this story. But Anne grew up in a strict German court. She did not know that the man dressed as a servant was King Henry, playing a game. She spoke to him him like a real servant. Henry was very embarrassed.\nHenry started complaining that Anne was not pretty. He said that he could not have sexual intercourse with her because she had \"bad breath\" and smelled. Anne's previous engagement to the Duke of Lorraine was used as an excuse for a divorce, and Anne agreed to it. In July 1540 Henry divorced Anne and married Catherine Howard, who was younger and prettier.\nAfter the divorce.\nAfter the divorce, Henry made Anne his \"sister\" and gave her money and land for the rest of her life. As part of her divorce agreement, Henry gave Anne Hever Castle to live in. Anne invited Henry's daughters Mary and Elizabeth to visit her at Hever Castle. King Henry visited her too. In 1541, there were rumors that King Henry had gotten his ex-wife Anne pregnant, but historians do not think this is true.\nAfter Henry died, Anne did not have enough money. His son, Edward VI, did not give her the same generous sums.\nAnne of Cleves died on July 16, 1557 when she was 41 years old.

She was princess of England, and was Queen of France for three months. After being Queen of France, she married someone else, and became Duchess of Suffolk until her death.\nBiography.\nMary Tudor was born on 18 March 1496 in Richmond Palace. Her older brothers were Arthur, Prince of Wales, and Prince Henry, and her older sister was Princess Margaret. Henry and Mary were close as children. Later in life, when Henry became King Henry VIII of England, he even named his ship, the Mary Rose, after her. His first daughter, Mary (later known as Queen Mary I of England), was probably also named after her.\nMary's father was anxious for all his children to make good marriages, and many of the other kings and queens of Europe wanted Mary as a wife for one of their sons. She was first betrothed to Charles of Castile, later the Holy Roman Emperor. This betrothal was broken later, and she did not get married until after her brother Henry became king. When Mary was 18 she married King Louis XII of France, who was 52 years old. She was married in Abbeville, France, on 9 October 1514. Mary did not want to marry King Louis, but agreed when her brother said that she could marry anyone she wanted after Louis died. Louis died on 1 January 1515, and Mary soon married Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. \nMary did not have any children while married to Louis, but she did when she was married to Charles. Her children's names were Henry, Frances and Eleanor. Frances went on to be the mother of Lady Jane Grey, who was the Queen of England for only nine days.\nAfter suffering failing health for some years, Mary Tudor died on 25 June, 1533 at the age of thirty eight at Westhorpe Hall, Westhorpe, Suffolk, possibly of cancer. Her husband then married Catherine Willoughby."}

At the time, Louis was not expected to become King of France. The King, Charles VIII, was a young man and could still have had children, but Charles had an accident and died suddenly. Charles was Jeanne's brother. Louis was Charles's cousin and next in line to the throne. When he became king, he had to end his marriage to Jeanne, partly because she was disabled and could not have children. \nLouis's second wife was Anne of Brittany, who was the daughter of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Anne had been married to King Charles VIII until his death, but all of their children had died. As a result of her marriage to Charles, the dukedom of Brittany had become part of the kingdom of France. Louis wanted to keep Brittany, but in order to do so he had to marry Anne. After her marriage to Louis, Anne had two daughters, who were called Claude and Renee. \nIn France, women were not allowed to rule the country, so Louis still wanted a son to become king after him. After Anne died, Louis married for a third time. His last wife was Mary Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII of England. She was many years younger than he was. Louis only lived for three months after their marriage. Because Louis had no sons, the throne went to Francis, the husband of his daughter Claude."}

There is no defined difference between a muppet and a puppet other than the link to Jim Henson. Many of Jim Henson's muppets have large eyes, round noses, and large mouths that go from one end of the face to the other (almost ear to ear). Muppets are often made out of foam with felt on top. Puppeteers usually control the muppet with one hand in the head and the other hand controls the muppets arms. Sometimes the arms have a stick that is used to move the hand and arm - this is called the \"arm rod.\" Puppeteers hold the arm rod at one end and the other end touches the muppet hand. Some muppets have hands that are gloves. Puppeteers put their hands in the gloves of these muppets so the muppet can move its fingers.

{"id": "11055", "revid": "836587", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11055", "title": "John of England", "text": "King John (24 December 1166 \u2013 19 October 1216) was the son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was King of England from 6 April 1199, until his death. He became King of England after the death of his brother Richard I (Richard the Lionheart).\nHis reign was marked by disputes between John and his barons and bishops. Because of this the nobles forced him to agree to the Magna Carta, which limited his power. The Magna Carta was a significant legal document in English history, as well as one of the first English \u201cbills of rights\u201d. It introduced the idea that monarchs had limited rights and had to follow certain laws, and it gave the nobles more say in the government. It affected English government and inspired those of other countries.\nFamily history.\nAs a young man, John already had a reputation for treachery. He conspired sometimes with and sometimes against his elder brothers, Henry, Richard and Geoffrey. In 1184, John and Richard both claimed that they were the rightful heir to Aquitaine, one of many unfriendly encounters between the two.\nRichard's absence.\nRichard, now King Richard I of England was absent on the Third Crusade from 1190 to 1194. John attempted to overthrow William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was Richard's designated 'chief justiciar' (like a Regent or Prime Minister). This was one of the events which led later writers to cast John as the villain in the legend of Robin Hood.\nJohn was more popular than Longchamp in London. In October 1191 the leading citizens of the city opened the gates to John while Longchamp was confined in the tower. John promised the city the right to govern itself as a commune in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive.\nAs he returned from the Crusade, Richard was captured by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, and handed over to Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor, who held him for ransom. Meanwhile, John had joined forces with Philip Augustus, King of France. They sent a letter to Henry asking him to keep Richard away from England for as long as possible, offering payment to keep Richard imprisoned. Henry declined their offer, and got his ransom from Eleanor of Aquitaine (who had to pawn the Crown Jewels). Richard was set free. John then begged forgiveness from Richard, who granted it and named him heir presumptive.\nReign.\nDispute with Arthur.\nOn Richard's death (6 April 1199) John was accepted in Normandy and England. He was crowned king at Westminster on 27 May, Ascension Day.\nHowever, Anjou, Maine, and Brittany declared for Arthur of Brittany, son of his elder brother Geoffrey. Arthur fought his uncle for the throne, with the support of Philip II of France. The conflict between Arthur and John had serious consequences for both. Finally, Philip recognised John over Arthur. The price paid was John's agreement to be Philip's vassal in Normandy and Angevin.\nNevertheless, conflicts continued until in 1202 Philip declared all John's French lands and territories, except Gascony in the southwest, and immediately occupied them. Philip gave Arthur all the land he had taken from John, except for Normandy, and betrothed him to his daughter Marie.\nJohn now needed to fight to get back 'his' land in France. In 1203 John ordered all shipyards in England to provide at least one ship, with the newly-built Portsmouth Naval Base to provide several. He made Portsmouth the new home of the navy. By the end of 1204, John had 45 large ships available to him, and from then on an average of four new ones every year. He also created an Admiralty of four admirals, responsible for various parts of the new navy. During John's reign, major improvements were made in ship design. He also created the first big transport ships. John is sometimes credited with the founding of the modern Royal Navy.\nAs part of the war, Arthur attempted to kidnap his own grandmother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, at Mirebeau, but was defeated and captured by John's forces. Arthur was imprisoned first at Falaise and then at Rouen. After this, Arthur's fate remains unknown, but it is believed that he was murdered by John. Assuming that he was murdered, Brittany, and later Normandy, rebelled against John. John also imprisoned his niece, Eleanor. Through deeds such as these, John acquired a reputation for ruthlessness.\nDealings with Bordeaux.\nIn 1203, John exempted the citizens and merchants of Bordeaux from the \"Grande Coutume\", which was the principal tax on their exports. In exchange, the regions of Bordeaux, Bayonne and Dax pledged support against the French Crown. The unblocked ports gave Gascon merchants open access to the English wine market for the first time. The following year, John granted the same exemptions to La Rochelle and Poitou.\nLost lands and disputes.\nNormandy seized by the French.\nIn June 1204, the fall of Rouen allowed Phillip to annex Normandy and also take parts of Anjou and Poitou.\nJohn needed money for his army, but the loss of the French territories, especially Normandy, greatly reduced the state income. A huge tax would be needed to reclaim these territories. He imposed the first income tax, raising the (then) huge sum of \u00a370,000.\nDispute with the Pope.\nWhen Archbishop of Canterbury Hubert Walter died on 13 July 1205, John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III. The Canterbury Cathedral Chapter claimed the sole right to elect Hubert's successor, and favoured Reginald, a candidate out of their midst. However, both the English bishops and the King wanted someone else to have this powerful office. The king wanted John de Gray, one of his own men. When their dispute could not be settled, the Chapter secretly elected one of their members as Archbishop. A second election imposed by John resulted in another nominee. When they both appeared in the Vatican, Innocent disavowed (rejected) both elections, and his candidate, Stephen Langton, was elected despite the objections of John's observers. John was supported in his position by the English barons and many of the English bishops, and refused to accept Langton.\nJohn expelled (dismissed) the Canterbury Chapter in July 1207, to which the Pope reacted by placing an interdict on the kingdom which meant that no one could receive religious blessings. John retaliated by closing down the churches. He confiscated (on paper) all church possessions, but individual churches were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. After his excommunication, John tightened these measures and he got plenty from the income of vacant sees and abbeys. For example, the church lost an estimated 100,000 marks to the Crown in 1213. The Pope gave permission for some churches to hold Mass behind closed doors in 1209. In 1212, they allowed last rites to the dying. While the interdict was a burden to many, it did not result in rebellion against John.\nExcommunication and papal supremacy.\nIn November 1209 John was excommunicated, and in February 1213, Innocent threatened stronger measures unless John submitted. The papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulph in May 1213 (according to Matthew Paris, at the Knights Templar Church at Dover); in addition, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to God and the Saints Peter and Paul for a feudal service of 1,000 marks annually, 700 for England and 300 for Ireland. With this submission, written in a document, John gained the support of his papal overlord in his new dispute with the English barons.\nAfter settling his dispute with the papacy, John turned his attentions back to France. The European wars ended in defeat at the Battle of Bouvines in July 1214, which forced the king to accept an unfavourable peace with France.\nRebellion.\nMagna Carta.\nThe heavy scutage levy for the failed campaign was the last straw, and when John attempted to raise more in September 1214, many barons refused to pay. The barons no longer believed that John was capable of regaining his lost lands.\nIn May 1215, Robert Fitz Walter led forty barons to renounce homage to the king at Northampton. The so-called 'Army of God' marched on London, taking the capital as well as taking Lincoln and Exeter.\nJohn met their leaders and with their French and Scots allies at Runnymede, near London, on 15 June 1215. There, they sealed the Great Charter, called in Latin \"Magna Carta\". It established a council of 25 barons to see John kept to the clauses like protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, parliamentary assent for taxation, and scutage limitations.\nBecause he was forced to seal the charter, John sought approval to break it, from his overlord the Pope. Denouncing it as \"not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust\", the Pope agreed, which provoked the First Barons' War. The barons invited a French invasion by Prince Louis VIII of France, who accepted the offer of the crown of England as a reward for his support.\nWar with barons.\nJohn travelled around the country to oppose the rebel forces, and directed a two-month siege of the rebel-held Rochester Castle. While a small force arrived in rebel-held London in November, the Scots under their king, Alexander II, invaded northern England. By the end of December, John was leading a murderous expedition in the north, culminating with the sacking of Berwick-upon-Tweed.\nThe French retook Rochester and much of the south, although the royalists held on to Windsor and Dover.\nWith the momentum swinging from John, some of his generals, including his half-brother William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, went to the rebel side. By the end of the summer, Louis held a third of the country and had the support of two-third of the barons. In September, Alexander II travelled down to pay homage to Louis at Dover, where the French pretender had being laying siege to Dover Castle.\nDeath.\nRetreating from the French invasion, John took a safe route around the marshy area of The Wash to avoid the rebel held area of East Anglia. His slow baggage train (including the Crown Jewels), took a direct route across it and was lost to the incoming tide. This dealt John a terrible blow, which affected his health and state of mind. Succumbing to dysentery and moving from place to place, he died at Newark Castle. He was buried at Worcester Cathedral, in the West Midlands.\nWhen King John died on 18 October, 1216 his nine-year-old son, Henry was too young to rule the kingdom. William Marshal was appointed as Regent to Henry III to make decisions on Henry\u2019s behalf until he came of age. The barons switched their allegiance to the new king, forcing Louis to give up his claim and sign the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217.\nLegacy.\nKing John's reign began with military defeats \u2013 he lost Normandy to Philip II of France in his first five years on the throne. His reign ended with England torn by civil war and himself on the verge of being forced out of power. In 1213, he made England a papal fief to resolve a conflict with the Catholic Church, and his rebellious barons forced him to seal Magna Carta in 1215, the act for which he is best remembered.\nJohn is responsible for the creation of another English cultural icon, the historic, medieval London Bridge. To finance the construction of a large bridge across the Thames, King John allowed houses, shops, and a church to be built on top of the bridge.\nJohn was an efficient ruler, but he lost approval of the barons by taxing them in ways outside those traditionally allowed by feudal overlords. The tax known as scutage became particularly unpopular. John was a fair-minded and well informed king, however. He often sat as a judge in the Royal Courts, and his justice was much sought after. Also, John's employment of an able Chancellor and clerks resulted in the first proper set of records.\nWinston Churchill summarised the legacy of John's reign: \"When the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns\". Medieval historian C. Warren Hollister called John an \"enigmatic figure\":\nMarriage and children.\nIn 1189, John was married to Isabel of Gloucester. They had no children. John had their marriage annulled, and she was never acknowledged as queen. John remarried, on 24 August 1200, , who was twenty years his junior. John had kidnapped her from her fianc\u00e9, Hugh X of Lusignan.\nIsabella bore five children:\nJohn had many illegitimate children. Matthew Paris accuses him of seducing the more attractive daughters and sisters of his barons and relatives. John had these illegitimate children:\nThe surname \"Fitzroy\" is Norman-French for 'son of the king'.\nKing John in Legend.\nJohn is also famous for his part in the Robin Hood stories where he plays one of Robin's enemies.

It learned from other languages through political and trade connections during the times of the Hanse, and from various waves of immigration.

Its capital is Hartford, and its largest city is Bridgeport.\nGeography-Climate.\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain in Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York meet (42\u00b0 3' N; 73\u00b0 29' W), on the southern slope of Mount Frissell, whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.\nThe Connecticut River cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound, Connecticut's outlet to the Atlantic Ocean. Further information: List of Connecticut rivers\nThe state, although small, has regional variations in its landscape and culture from the wealthy estates of Fairfield County's \"Gold Coast\" to the rolling mountains and horse-farms of the Litchfield Hills of northwestern Connecticut. Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New Haven, then northwards to Hartford, as well as further up the coast near New London. Many towns center around a small park, known as a \"green,\" (such as the New Haven Green). Near the green may stand a small white church, a town meeting hall, a tavern, and several colonial houses. Forests, rivers, lakes, waterfalls and a sandy shore add to the state's beauty.\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the distinctive Southwick Jog/Granby Notch, an approximately 2.5\u00a0mile (4.0\u00a0km) square detour into Connecticut slightly west of the center of the border. Somewhat surprisingly, the origin of this anomaly is uncertain, with stories ranging from surveyors who were drunk, attempting to avoid hostile Native Americans, or taking a shortcut up the Connecticut River; Massachusetts residents attempting to avoid Massachusetts' high taxes for the low taxes of Connecticut; Massachusetts' interest in the resources represented by the Congamond Lakes which lie on the border of the jog; and the need to compensate Massachusetts for an amount of land given to Connecticut due to inaccurate survey work. Perhaps the only suggested reason which can be safely ruled out is that the jog is necessary to prevent Massachusetts from sliding out into the Atlantic Ocean! In any event, the dispute over the border retarded the development of the region, since neither state would invest in even such basic amenities as schools for the area until the dispute had been settled.\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut, where it abuts New York State, is marked by a panhandle in Fairfield County, containing Greenwich, Stamford, Fairfield, Westport, Wilton, and Darien, housing some of the wealthiest residents in the world. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of territorial disputes in the late 1600s, culminating with New York giving up its claim to this area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from Ridgefield, Connecticut to the Massachusetts border as well as undisputed claim to Rye, New York.\nAreas maintained by the National Park Service include Appalachian National Scenic Trail; Quinebaug &amp; Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor; and Weir Farm National Historic Site.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Connecticut\" comes from the Mohegan Indian word \"Quinnehtukqut\". It means \"Long River Place\" or \"Beside the Long Tidal River.\" The first explorer from Europe to come to Connecticut was Adriaen Block, from the Netherlands. After he explored this region in 1614, Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River (Named Versche Rivier by the Dutch) and built a fort near present-day Hartford, which they called \"House of Hope\" (Dutch: Huys de Hoop).\nThe first English settlers came in 1633. They were Puritans from Massachusetts, who were led by the Reverend Thomas Hooker. They founded the Connecticut Colony. Colonies were also established at Old Saybrook and New Haven, which later became part of Connecticut. Historically important colonial settlements included: Windsor (1633), Wethersfield (1634), Saybrook (1635), Hartford (1636), New Haven (1638), and New London (1646).\nBecause the Dutch were outnumbered by the English settlers, they left their fort in 1654. Connecticut's first constitution, the \"Fundamental Orders,\" was adopted on January 14, 1639, while its current constitution, the third for Connecticut, was adopted in 1965. Connecticut is the fifth of the original thirteen states.\nThe western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. According to a 1650 agreement with the Dutch, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from the west side of Greenwich Bay \"provided the said line come not within 10\u00a0miles [16 km] of Hudson River.\" On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the \"South Sea,\" i.e. the Pacific Ocean. This probably added confusion to the early forefathers because the Pacific Ocean is located on the west coast of the United States. Agreements with New York, the \"Pennamite Wars\" with Pennsylvania over Westmoreland County, followed by Congressional intervention, and the relinquishment and sale of the Western Reserve lands brought the state to its present boundaries.\nReferences.\nNotes"}

Despite this, the population of Idaho was estimated at only 1,787,065 by the United States Census Bureau in 2019, making it ranked the 39th largest state by population. \nIdaho is bordered by Washington and Oregon on the west, Montana and Wyoming on the east, Utah and Nevada on the south and the country of Canada (British Columbia) on the north side. Idaho is known for its vast mountainous landscapes, and it is literally covered from north to south by the Rocky Mountains. Idaho is also home to the massive Snake River, which comes from the Grand Tetons in Wyoming and eventually flows to meld with the Columbia River in Washington state. This river dissects Hell's Canyon, the deepest gorge in America, which lies the state's Oregon border, and flows through south central Idaho. This river provides a fertile plain which is the base for most of the state's agricultural industries, and the production of the potatoes for which Idaho is known. Idaho's state nickname is the \"Gem State\", despite also being known as the \"Spud State\", because of a man named George M. Willing who claimed it was derived from a Shoshone term. \nIdaho's most prominent universities are Boise State University in its capital, Idaho State University in Pocatello, and the University of Idaho in Moscow.\nIdaho's state motto is \"Esto perpetua\", which is Latin for \"Let it be forever\".\nCities and towns.\nPopulation &gt; 100,000 (city area)\nPopulation &gt; 50,000 (city area)\nPopulation &gt; 30,000 (city area)\nPopulation &gt; 10,000 (city area)\nSmaller Towns and Cities\nHistory of Idaho.\nIdaho was formerly Idaho Territory, until July 27, 1890, when it became the 43rd state.

It was first published on September 21, 1937. Tolkien wrote it in the 1930s for his children as a bedtime story. The story takes place before \"The Lord of the Rings\".\nThe plot is about the hobbit (a small race of people invented by Tolkien) Bilbo Baggins who goes on an adventurous quest with a group of dwarves and the wizard Gandalf, in order to fight the dragon Smaug, which has stolen the treasures and home of the dwarves.\nAlthough Tolkien borrowed (for example names and background) from his own Middle-earth storyline, \"The Hobbit\" was at first not intended to be part of it. Only later, when Tolkien wrote \"The Lord of the Rings\", did he integrate the story of both \"Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" into his Middle-earth world.\nCharacters.\nBilbo Baggins is a hobbit, who lives a quiet life in the Shire, who goes on an unexpected adventure during the book. He is visited by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, who enlists him to travel with a group of 13 dwarves, as a burglar.\nThorin Oakenshield is the leader of the group of dwarves, and true King under the Mountain of the old Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain. The dwarves are on an adventure to get their old kingdom back from the dragon Smaug, who conquered the Lonely Mountain and made the dwarves flee years before. The other dwarves are and Thorin's young nephews F\u00edli and K\u00edli, Thorin's cousins Balin and Dwalin, \u00d3in and Gl\u00f3in, Dori, Nori, Ori, and the dwarves Bifur, Bofur and Bombur.\nAlong their travels they met many people and creatures: Elrond, a wise elf in Rivendell; goblins; Gollum, a creature with a magic ring; speaking Great Eagles; Beorn the bear shapeshifter; the Elvenking of Mirkwood; Bard the Bowman, and many more.\nPlot.\nThe hobbit Bilbo Baggins lives a quiet and peaceful life. One day the wizard Gandalf comes to him, and with him thirteen dwarves: Thorin Oakenshield, F\u00edli and K\u00edli, Balin, Dwalin, \u00d3in, Gl\u00f3in, Dori, Nori, Ori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur.\nThe dwarves tell their story: A long time ago they lived in the Lonely Mountain. Thorin's father was their king, the \"King under the Mountain\". But one day the dragon Smaug came to the Lonely Mountain and killed all of the dwarves he found. The dragon took their treasure and now lives in the Lonely Mountain. But some of the dwarves could flee.\nNow the dwarves want to go back the Lonely Mountain, and get back their home and treasures from the dragon. Gandalf wants Bilbo to come with them, and work as a master thief. At first Bilbo does not want to, but later he goes with them.\nGandalf, the dwarves, and Bilbo start to go east on their journey to the Lonely Mountain. After Gandalf saves the group from three trolls, they find the trolls' cave. Among the trolls' things there is some gold and swords. Gandalf, Thorin, and Bilbo each get a sword. The group continues on to the elven city Rivendell. Its master, Elrond, gives them helpful information.\nAs the group travels east over the Misty Mountains, they are attacked by Goblins (Orcs). The Goblins take the dwarves and Bilbo into their caves. Gandalf saves them and the group flees. During their flight Bilbo gets lost, and tries to find a way out by himself. In the tunnels Bilbo finds a ring, which he puts in his pocket. By an underground lake, Bilbo meets the creature Gollum. Gollum and Bilbo play a game of riddles. If Bilbo wins the game, Gollum will show him the way out; if Gollum wins, he will eat Bilbo. When Bilbo does not know another riddle to ask Gollum, he finds the ring in his pocket and asks himself: \"What have I got in my pocket?\" Gollum thinks this is a riddle, but cannot answer it, and so Bilbo wins the game. Gollum is angry and does not want to help Bilbo. Gollum then goes away to get something he owns: a magical ring, which turns the wearer invisible. Gollum cannot find his ring, and realizes that Bilbo has it. Gollum goes back, but Bilbo is afraid and runs away. While running, the ring slips on Bilbo's finger and he becomes invisible. Gollum runs past Bilbo, towards the way out of the caves. Bilbo realizes that the ring makes him invisible. With the help of the ring he can follow Gollum and get out of the caves. Outside, Bilbo again meets Gandalf and the dwarves.\nThe group is attacked by Goblins and Wargs, but saved by the Great Eagles. The group comes to the home of Beorn, a big man that can become a bear. After staying at Beorn's house, they continue to the forest Mirkwood. At the border of Mirkwood, Gandalf leaves the group. Bilbo and the dwarves have go through Mirkwood without him. The dwarves are attacked and captured by giant spiders. With the help of his ring and his sword, Bilbo saves them. Bilbo names his sword \"Sting\". The Wood-Elves capture the dwarves. Bilbo again uses the ring and saves the dwarves. He frees them and puts them into barrels, which he lets swim down a river out of Mirkwood. The group comes to Lake-town, a human city near the Lonely Mountain.\nThe dwarves and Bilbo travel to the Lonely Mountain. They can find the secret door into the mountain, and open it. Bilbo goes in two times and meets the dragon Smaug. Bilbo steals a golden cup, and finds out that Smaug has a weak place on his left chest. Bilbo tells this to the dwarves, but a thrush (a bird) also hears it. Smaug is angry and goes out to destroy Lake-town. But in Laketown the thrush tells the archer Bard of the dragon's weak point, and Bard shoots the dragon. A big part of Laketown is destroyed, but Smaug is killed.\nThe dwarves are happy to be back in their old home, and to have their old treasures back. Thorin sends a message to the dwarves of his people, and tells them to come. But soon the people from Laketown and the Mirkwood-Elves arrive. Both peoples want a part of the treasure, but the dwarves do not want to give them anything. The humans and elves start a siege of the Lonely Mountain. After a while the other dwarves of Thorin's people come: D\u00e1in II Ironfoot and an army of dwarves.\nThe three armies almost start to fight each other, but then the wizard Gandalf appears. Gandalf tells them that an army of Goblins is coming to the Lonely Mountain, and because of that the humans, elves, and dwarves have to fight the Goblins together. The \"Battle of Five Armies\" is long and hard, but is finally won with the help of the Great Eagles and Beorn. Thorin's nephews F\u00edli and K\u00edli are killed in the battle. Thorin is wounded and dies afterwards. D\u00e1in becomes \"King under the Mountain\". Everyone gets a part of the dwarves' treasure. In the end Bilbo returns home, and lives happily everafter.\nAdaptations.\n\"The Hobbit\" has been adapted many times."}
