Brazil was\noriginally a colony of the Portuguese Empire but became its center when the Prince Regent Jo\u00e3o VI fled the French invasion of Portugal in 1808. When Jo\u00e3o returned to Portugal he left his son Pedro as regent of the autonomous Kingdom of Brazil.\nOn 7 September 1822, Pedro declared Brazil to be an independent Empire and was acclaimed by the people as emperor. However, in 1831 he was able to return to Portugal. He abdicated the Brazilian throne and left his young son Pedro II as emperor. His reign saw three international wars and decades of economic prosperity and political stability.\nPedro I, Pedro II and the imperial family of Brazil wanted the abolition of slavery, and on 13 May 1888 the imperial princess regent, Isabel de Bragan\u00e7a and Bourbon signed the \"Golden Law\" on behalf of her father, ending slavery in Brazil. By that time, Brazil had become the last major nation to have slavery. Former plantation owners, dissatisfied with the abolition of slavery, joined the republican movement led by Deodoro da Fonseca, an elderly Marshal, to carry out a Coup d'etat and install a republic which became Brazil's first dictatorship on November 15, 1889. The imperial family was exiled, and the Republican government persecuted, tortured and killed all those who opposed the regime."}

It is the 24th largest city in the state of California. The city has annexed unincorporated areas, which has made the population higher. Santa Clarita is about 35\u00a0miles (56\u00a0km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. It takes up most of Santa Clarita Valley. It is a good example of a U.S. edge city or boomburb. Santa Clarita was ranked by \"Money\" magazine in 2006 as 18th of the top 100 places to live. There are four smaller communities in Santa Clarita. They are called Valencia, Saugus, Newhall, and Canyon Country. Santa Clarita is well known for the amusement park Six Flags Magic Mountain as well as the TV program Santa Clarita Diet.\nHistory.\nSanta Clarita became a city in December 1987, but its history stretches back many hundreds of years. In the year 450, a group of Native Americans called the Tataviam arrived in the valley, and as many as 2,000 lived there at their height.\nIn 1842, Francisco Lopez found gold in the area. It was the first recorded gold in the state. It is marked in an area called Placerita Canyon, which was also the original \"back lot\" area for Hollywood movie makers.\nThe town of Newhall is named after Henry Mayo Newhall, a businessman who became rich during the California Gold Rush. At first, he founded H.M. Newhall &amp; Company, an auction house in San Francisco. Then, he got into the railroad business. He put money into companies that would join San Francisco to other cities and was in charge of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad. He sold the business to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1870, and was one of the people in charge of it.\nAfter railroads, Newhall started focusing on real estate and ranching. He bought 143,000\u00a0acres of land between Los Angeles and Monterey counties. The largest piece of land was the 46,460\u00a0acres of land in northern Los Angeles County which was called the Rancho San Francisco, later called Newhall Ranch. He sold some of his property to the Southern Pacific Railroad which built a train line through the present-day Newhall Pass. They also built a town and named it after Newhall. The first station North on the new line was named Saugus by Newhall, after his hometown of Saugus, Massachusetts. His children created the Newhall Land and Farming Company that helped build the rest of Santa Clarita.\nOn September 5, 1876, Charles Crocker and joined their railroads together in Canyon Country, linking Los Angeles with the rest of the country for the first time.\nA couple of weeks later, on September 26, Charles Alexander Mentry built California's first useful oil well in Mentryville, helping kickstart the Southern California oil industry. The oil was cleaned in Newhall, in what is now the oldest existing oil cleaner in the world. It was open between 1874 and 1888.\nThe Saugus Cafe on Railroad Avenue in Saugus was opened in 1887. It is far and away the oldest open restaurant in Los Angeles County and the 16th oldest open restaurant in the state.\nFilming in Santa Clarita began at the turn of the century and featured actors including William S. Hart and John Wayne. Hart and actor Harry Carey both have parks named after them in the county.\nThe Santa Clarita Valley was the scene of the second most deadly disaster in Californian history, behind the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. It was known as the \"worst civil engineering failure of the 20th century\". Before midnight on March 12, 1928, the St. Francis Dam collapsed. It caused a flood to rush all the way West to the Pacific Ocean near Ventura. An estimated 431 people were killed, and the site of the present-day Westfield Valencia Town Center was buried in muck. The disaster resulted in the end of the career of engineer William Mulholland.\nAfter many attempts to form a city or a county, the four communities of Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus, and Valencia finally joined to become the City of Santa Clarita at 4:30\u00a0PM on December 15, 1987.\nGeography.\nSanta Clarita is located in the Santa Clarita Valley, a valley in northern Los Angeles County, just north of the San Fernando Valley and southwest of the Antelope Valley. The Santa Clara River runs east\u2013west through the valley. Freeways Interstate 5 and State Route 14 also run across the valley. Six Flags Magic Mountain is located just west of Interstate 5, in Stevenson Ranch. Smaller hills also cross the valley. Hiking trails are common in the hills, including Central Park, Quigley Canyon, East Canyon, Rice Canyon, and Towsley Canyon.\nClimate.\nSanta Clarita has a Mediterranean climate with warm and dry days throughout the year. This, along with the Chaparral ecosystem in the area, makes wildfires common in the summer."}

In rural parts of the country, local villagers take the law into their own hands and punish people.\nHomosexual practices with boys.\nEven though both society and law try to stop homosexual activities, there is a form of bisexuality (sexual attraction to both sexes) within mainstream Afghan culture. This happens when boys are kidnapped to act as sexual slaves for adult men. This often happens in a military where there is no access to women. It also happens when an adult man gives money or gifts to young boys in return for sexual activity. These acts are accepted because they are not seen as being an act of LGBT identity, but rather an act of male power and dominance. The boys in these acts are forced to be the \"female\" partner in the relationship.\nMilitary members generally do not have access to women, and often boys are kidnapped to be humiliated and raped by adult men. Other boys become prostitutes for adult men, regardless of their sexual orientation (one's tendencies of sexual attractions)\nThe boys involved are called \"Bacha bazi\" in Persian and there are a large number of them in the big cities of Afghanistan. A law has been passed to stop Afghan male soldiers from having the boys they sexually abuse to live with them.\nIn 2007, reports stated that the practice of \"bacha bareesh\" (beardless boys) is still prevalent in parts of northern Afghanistan. This practice involves teenage boys being dressed in women's clothing and made to participate in dance competitions and engage in sexual acts.\nBecause of this, homosexuality is often associated with both sexual abuse (forcing people to unwillingly commit any sexual act or any sexual assault) and prostitution (having sex with people for money), a popular misconception that affects the laws made in the country."}

In 2004, the band release their first EP, called \"Ready to Rock\". Their first studio album was released in 2007 and is called \"Runnin' Wild\". This album have three singles: \"Runnin' Wild\", \"Too Much, Too Young, Too Fast\" and \"Diamond in the Rough\". In 2010, the band released their second studio album, called \"No Guts. No Glory\". The third studio album is called \"Black Dog Barking\" and was released in 2013.\nHistory.\nFormation and \"Ready to Rock\" (2003\u20132006).\nAirbourne formed as a hard rock band in late 2003 in the Victorian country town of Warrnambool by Joel O'Keeffe (born c. 1985) and his younger brother Ryan (born c. 1986). Joel had played guitar since the age of 11 and Ryan got his first drum kit four years later also at the age of 11. Joel met David Roads (born c. 1983) when the two worked at the Hotel Warrnambool. The pair brought their guitars to work and, after their shifts, jammed on song ideas, Roads was asked to join the O\u2019Keeffe brothers on rhythm guitar for rehearsals at their house. By late 2003, Adam Jacobson had joined on bass guitar, the group was named Airbourne and played regular gigs at the local Criterion Hotel.\nIn March 2004 the four-piece won a statewide band competition, Push-On, in Melbourne. Their early material was influenced by Australian rock bands AC/DC, The Angels, Billy Thorpe and Rose Tattoo. They recorded an eight-track extended play, \"Ready to Rock\", which appeared in July 2004 as an independent self-funded release. By that time Jacobson was replaced by Justin Street (born c. 1986) on bass guitar \u2013 Ryan had met Street while stumbling home drunk from a party one night. In early 2005, the band relocated to Melbourne and in August, they signed a five album record deal with Capitol Records. According to Joel, while the band were living in a shared house they threw a party, and during listening to aKrokus CD, \"Rock the Block\", a blown fuse resulted in a fire burning the back part of the house. The group have supported M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Mot\u00f6rhead, Iron Maiden and The Rolling Stones, as well as performing at summer music festivals.\n\"Runnin' Wild\" (2006\u20132009).\nIn 2006 Airbourne travelled to the United States to begin work on their first studio album, \"Runnin' Wild\", with producer Bob Marlette (Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper).\"Runnin' Wild\" was released in Australia on 23 June 2007. Three singles were issued from the album, \"Runnin' Wild\" (May), \"Too Much, Too Young, Too Fast\" (June), a playable track on \"Guitar Hero World Tour\"; and \"Diamond in the Rough\". In February, Capitol Records had cancelled their contract with Airbourne, but the album was still issued in Australia through EMI. In June, the band signed with Roadrunner Records for international distribution.\nThe album peaked in the top\u00a030 on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia, top\u00a040 on New Zealand's RIANZ Albums Chart and appeared on charts in Austria, Switzerland and France. During late 2007, the group toured the United States supporting Kid Rock and Korn. \"Runnin' Wild\" was issued in North America, Europe and Japan in January 2008, after which they relocated permanently to the US. The album reached the Top\u00a0100 on the UK Albums Chart and appeared on the \"Billboard\" 200. In September 2007, they issued a five-track live extended play, \"Live at the Playroom\".\nIn a September 2008 interview with MetalSucks, Joel discussed comparisons with AC/DC, \"whoever you are when you come out, especially if you\u2019re from Australia and you sound like we do, you\u2019re going to get compared to anyone who is out there. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, you are going to get compared to somebody. To be compared to the best rock and roll band in the business, who are still going today and are about to release another album, there is no higher compliment...\" In November at the Astoria in London, Dan Hawkins (Stone Gods/The Darkness) joined Airbourne on stage to play the AC/DC song, \"Whole Lotta Rosie\". Hawkins played Joel's guitar (white Gibson Explorer) while Joel sang without any guitar.\n\"No Guts. No Glory.\" (2009\u20132011).\nRoads confirmed that in January 2009, Airbourne would enter the studio to begin recording their second album, \"No Guts.

Unst is the most northerly inhabited island in the United Kingdom. The village lies halfway along the island's east coast on a sheltered bay called Balta Sound.\nBaltasound was formerly the most important herring port in Shetland, in 1902 its catch exceeded that of the Shetland capital Lerwick. The herring trade declined rapidly after 1905 but the physical remains of the herring boom remained long after.\nBaltasound was the home of the noted Victorian botanist Thomas Edmondston, who was born at Buness House where his uncle, also called Thomas was the laird. A memorial stone erected outside the house by the elder Thomas Edmondston commemorates scientific studies undertaken there by the French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot.\nBaltasound can also lay claim to the most northerly \"wood\" in the British Isles, although it is not very substantial.\nClimate.\nBaltasound is home to the most Northerly Met Office weather station in the United Kingdom. Despite its northerly location, Baltasound experiences a maritime climate, as with the rest of the British Isles, albeit a very pronounced one, with mild winters and particularly cool summers. It is generally cool and clammy throughout the year.\nBaltasound holds the record for the highest temperature recorded in the Shetland Islands: on 2 July 1958. On the same day, the highest humidex for Baltasound of 34 was recorded. It also possibly holds the record for the lowest Shetland temperature: on 5 February 2001.\nSunshine hours are not available for this station, so the sunshine values provided are for the whole of Northern Scotland. The extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months, December averages less than 45 minutes of bright sunshine daily.\nBaltasound is the snowiest low-lying area of the British isles, with an average of 64.7 days of snow falling per year."}

The genre evolved out of UK garage and is influenced by drum and bass, dancehall, ragga, and hip hop. Grime music is generally produced around 137-143 beats per minute, with its aggressive, jagged electronic sound. Rapping is also an important part of grime. \nPirate radios (illegal radio stations) were important in the early days of grime, as they were the only places that would play the genre before it was able to gain mainstream attention in the UK during the mid-2000s. Early important musicians would be Dizzee Rascal, Kano, Lethal Bizzle, and Wiley. Other important musicians include; P Money, Ghetts, Jme, Skepta, Stormzy and grime groups such as Boy Better Know, Newham Generals, Roll Deep, and Ruff Sqwad. In the mid-2010s, grime started to gain attention in Australia. The genre has been described as the \"most significant musical development within the UK for decades\".\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nGrime began in the early 2000s in London. Early pirate radio stations (illegal radio stations) helped spread grime, such as Rinse FM, Deja Vu FM, Major FM, Freeze 92.7 and Raw Mission. The illegal radio stations were the first to play and promote grime music. At the time, grime did not have a standard name, with many different names being used instead, such as 8-bar, nu shape, sublow, and eskibeat. These names were used to describe a new sound that was developing out of UK garage, drifting away from its house music influences and instead drifting towards darker themes and sounds.\nAmong the first songs to be called \"grime\" were \"Eskimo\", \"Ice Rink\", and \"Igloo\" by Wiley, \"Pulse X\" by Musical Mob, and \"Creeper\" by Danny Weed.\n\"Grime\" was named by journalists who originally defined the genre as \"grimy\", due to its gritty and dark sound, which subsequently became \"grime\".\nDevelopment.\nDizzee Rascal, Wiley, Kano, and Lethal Bizzle were among the first grime musicians to gain mainstream media attention in 2003-2004. Their albums \"Boy in da Corner\", \"Treddin' on Thin Ice\", \"Home Sweet Home\", and \"Against All Oddz\" were the first to gain popularity. Dizzee Rascal gained a lot of acclaim and commercial success with his album \"Boy in da Corner.\" In 2003, Dizzee Rascal was able to win the Mercury Music Prize because of the album. However, many other grime musicians were not able to gain mainstream popularity. To help advertise lesser-known musicians, Jammer (from the group Boy Better Know) created \"Lord of the Mics\" in 2004. \"Lord of the MIcs\" was a yearly DVD series, which provided a platform for lesser-known musicians to promote themselves. The musicians on \"Lord of the Mics\" showcased their talents by competing in battle raps (also called \"clashing\"). The DVD also contained interviews with grime musicians. The DVD was at first sold by Jammer himself, but he was later able to sell it via ukrecordshop.com which helped the DVD rise in popularity. The DVD helped many lesser-known grime artists gain popularity, and also helped grime gain a fanbase on the internet. Before the DVD, many grime artists only gained fans by performing live in pirate radio (illegal radio stations).\nInternational growth.\nThe 2005 release of 679 Recordings' \"Run the Road\" compilation, showcased some of the most popular grime releases to that point, increasing the popularity and fame of grime and grime artists internationally. A particularly notable grime artist who has had success overseas is Lady Sovereign, who reached #1 on MTV's TRL, appeared on \"Late Show with David Letterman\", and is now signed to Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records."}

The term can also mean the physical area of photographic film that contains the synchronized recorded sound.\nHistory.\nIn 1896 when people saw the first motion picture someone played music to go along with it. This was the era of the silent movie meaning only that the actors did not speak. A musician played different music to show drama, the character types and the storyline. There was music to introduce war, indians, cowboys and other types to the scenes. There was special music to introduce the hero. Even the villain had his own musical pieces to identify him. Finally, in 1927 moviemakers figured out how to include a soundtrack on the film. The movie \"The Jazz Singer\" was the first musical where the audience could hear Al Jolson perform.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

They came about naturally with deaf people and their relatives. But sign languages have existed among hearing peoples also. They were used by hunters to silently communicate around game animals. Native American peoples had a sign language that could be understood by Native Americans speaking as many as 40 different languages. Christian monks used sign language while living under code of silence. Factory workers and others in extremely noisy places use sign languages. \nCharles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e is considered the father of sign language. In 1771 he started the first free school for the deaf in Paris. He took in deaf students from many different places. Some came from Martha's Vineyard in the United States. There was a good deal of hereditary deafness there and the residents adopted their own sign language. Many came who used a local sign language.

Gay people cannot get married in Northern Ireland because the Northern Ireland assembly voted against legalising it.\nSex between two men was illegal in the UK until 1967, but no law was ever made regarding lesbian sexual activity. In 1967, sex between men was partially decriminalized in England and Wales. It was made legal for men over 21 years' old in 1967, with some very serious restrictions, legal for men over 18 in 1994, and equalized with the heterosexual age of consent in 2002. The bill in 2000 also introduced a lesbian age of consent for the first time too. In Scotland it was legalised in 1981 and in Northern Ireland it was legalized in 1982. However, the UK Parliament legislated for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, which is expected to come into force on or before 13 January 2020."}

They do this on areas called \"leks\". As the males dance they make a popping sound. This is done by inflating and deflating their two yellow throat sacs. They display their pointed tail feathers while they strut. As many as a dozen males may dance at the same time. Sometimes two males will fight with their wings. The hens will watch for several days before picking out a mate. They make their nests in the sagebrush. The males do not help with nesting or with raising chicks.\nOther websites.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

These times of year are usually best for the survival of the young. Factors include ambient temperature, food and water availability, and even changes in the predation behaviors of other species. The sexual interest and mating behavior goes on only during this period. \nBreeding seasons.\nFemale seasonal breeders will have one or more oestrous cycles only when she is \"in season\" or fertile At this time she is naturally ready to mate. At other times of the year they are not sexually interested. Male seasonal breeders may have changes in testosterone levels, testes weight, and fertility depending on the time of year. For example, male greater sage-grouse actually gain weight as their bodies get ready for the spring breeding season. Seasonal breeders are different than opportunistic breeders. These are species which mate whenever conditions allow it. They are also different from continuous breeders like humans that mate year-round.\nCommunal breeding.\nMany species breed in colonies or large communities which is known as communal breeding. It is common to see large groups of these species during their breeding seasons. These breeding colonies and their location are generally protected by wildlife conservation laws. This is to keep the species from going extinct. Some species have evolved to communal breeding in large breeding colonies. They cannot breed in smaller numbers or pairs alone. These species can be threatened by extinction if they are hunted on their breeding grounds or if their breeding colonies are destroyed. The Passenger pigeon is a famous example. They were probably the most numerous land bird on the American continent which had evolved for communal breeding. They became extinct due to large scale hunting in its communal breeding grounds. They were not able to breed in smaller numbers."}

The dark shell of the turtle is often scattered with yellow specks. The Blanding\u2019s turtle is commonly referred to as a semi-box turtle due to its bottom shell, known as the plastron, which is hinged across the front third. The hinge going across the shell allows the turtle to pull the front of the plastron strongly against the top half of the shell helping it to hide when threatened.\nHabitat.\nThe Blanding\u2019s turtle lives in wetland areas with shallow waters-such as rivers and streams- that are near sandy uplands. These wetland areas support the turtles with their rich, aquatic vegetation. \nBlanding\u2019s turtles are known to live in the Upper Midwest, New England, and Southeastern Canada regions. \nLife cycle.\nBlanding\u2019s turtles tend to spend the winter months in the muddy areas of deep marshes, backwater pools, ponds and streams. But in early spring they come out and move to temporary wetlands that allow for mating and breeding habitats. Mating will typically occur around early evening, but can go on until late night. They become sexually mature around the age of 12 years. When breeding, they breed only once a year and they typically have an egg clutch of about 10-26 eggs.\nEggs are laid far from water in preferably sandy areas. The hatchlings leave the nest starting around mid-August to early October. Blanding\u2019s turtles have a life expectancy of over 70 years. "}

She soon comes to her senses and regrets her decision to kill her children, so she drowns herself in a river in Latin America. She then becomes stuck between the physical and spiritual world on an eternal search for her children, not permitted to enter heaven without them. Her incessant weeping throughout the night gives her the title \"La Llorona\" (The Weeping Woman). \nParents often use this story to prevent their children from wandering out at night.

It is mainly in the southern half of Missouri. The MTNF was established on September 11, 1939. It is named for author Mark Twain, a Missouri native. The MTNF covers , of which are wilderness, and National Wild and Scenic River area. MTNF spans 29 counties. It represents 11% of all forested land in Missouri. MTNF is divided into six distinct ranger districts: \"Ava-Cassville-Willow Springs\", \"Eleven Point\", \"Houston-Rolla-Cedar Creek\", \"Poplar Bluff\", \"Potosi-Fredericktown\", and the \"Salem. The six ranger districts actually cover nine overall unique tracts of forests. The headquarters of the MTNF are in Rolla, Missouri.\nSome unique features of the Mark Twain include Greer Spring. It is the largest spring on National Forest land. It is part of the Eleven Point National Scenic River. The spring pumps an average of 214 million gallons of water per day into the river. The public can also visit the Glade Top Trail National Scenic Byway, which offers views of over to the Boston Mountains in Arkansas. Part of the Ozark Trail system winds through the National Forest.\nHistory.\nThe Mark Twain National Forest was created on February 17, 1976. The present day MTNF was once two different national forests, the \"Clark National Forest\" and the \"Mark Twain National Forest\". Both were proclaimed on September 11, 1939. In June 1973 the Clark and Mark Twain NF were brought under one headquarters. This was in Rolla and became known as the \"National forests in Missouri\". On Feb. 17, 1976, the forests were combined and renamed the Mark Twain National Forest.\nIn the 1870s logging of the state's native oak, hickory, and pine forests began. Sawmills were common, but by the 1920s they had disappeared. By then so had much of the state's native forests. In 1939 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the MTNF into existence. In March 1933, he also created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). In the area that would later become Mark Twain National Forest, hundreds of young men at over fifty CCC sites worked at building roads and planting hundreds of acres of pine trees. Many of their contributions can still be visited and enjoyed today.\nFeatures.\nThe Mark Twain is Missouri\u2019s only national forest. It includes roughly 1.5 million acres, mostly within the Ozark Highlands. Located across southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, the Ozark Highlands are an ancient landscape. They have large permanent springs. The area has over 5,000 caves. It is made up of old volcanic mountains with many nationally recognized streams. Parts of the Ozarks were never under oceans or glaciers. There are over 750 miles of hiking trails. About 200 miles out of a planned 500 mile Ozark trail have been completed. When finished it will connect St. Louis to the border of Arkansas. There it will connect with the Ozark Highlands Trail in northwest Arkansas. When completed the trail will be over 1,000 miles long. It will run from St. Louis, Missouri to Lake Fort Smith State Park, near Fort Smith, Arkansas.\nCounties.\nAlthough it is far from being the largest National Forest in acreage, Mark Twain National Forest is located in more counties than any other. As of September 30, 2007, its 1,490,862 acres (2,329.47 sq mi, or 6,033.3\u00a0km\u00b2) were spread over parts of 29 counties in southern and central Missouri."}

{"id": "513006", "revid": "7879371", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513006", "title": "Rus' (people)", "text": "The Rus () were an early medieval group or people who gave their name to the lands of Russia, Ruthenia, and Belarus. In the mid-800s they were centered around Novgorod. They dominated the area for over a hundred years. Many of the leaders of the Rus had Scandinavian names, later both Scandinavian and Slavic names. The Varangian Ruses of Novgorod, intermingled (mixed) with the Slavs of Kiev and it became known Kievan Rus'. \nWho were they?\nMost western scholars believe them to be a group of Varangians, specifically from Pomerania. According to the \"Povest vremennykh let\" or Russian Primary Chronicle of Rus', compiled in about 1113 AD, the Rus' had relocated from Pomerania. Their leader was named Rurik. Later, Rurik's relative Oleg captured Kiev, founding Kievan Rus'. The descendants of Rurik were the ruling dynasty of Rus' (after 862). In the controversy, this is called the \"Normanist\" view. There are also those who believe the Rus came from Sweden or Rothi or Roslagen as it is known today. \nThe \"anti-Normanist\" view is that the Rus' were Slavic people from south of Kiev. In support of this theory it has been pointed out that several rivers have similar names. Once example is the Ros river which is a tributary of the Dnieper river. This may have been where the Rus' took their name. The official Soviet Union history did not include the \"anti-norman\" viewpoint giving the reason: \"The Normanist theory is politically harmful, because it denies the ability of the Slavic nations to form an independent state by their own efforts.\" \nThe invitation.\nThe story from the Russian Primary Chronicle is that the Slavs of Kiev were fighting among themselves. To restore order they invited the legendary Varangian Rus Rurik to be their leader. This is another area of controversy. One school of thought accepts the Russian Primary Chronicle account with the Norman origin of the Rus' people. The opposing view says the Scandinavians played a small part in the creation of the Kievan Rus. The Scandinavians were simply hired by the Slavs to protect them. Since the 1990s there has been a further controversy over who, Russia or Ukraine, had a better claim to be descended from the Kievan Rus princes. Since the breakup of the USSR Russian historians are not forced to accept the anti-Norman theory. \nByzantines.\nAnother version is possible in this comment by scholars on \"De Administrando Imperio\", by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII (913-959):\nCommon threads.\nIt was at this point in history the area of Kiev grew and expanded. The Kievan state lasted about a hundred years, until about 972. Between 839 and 1043 the Balto Slavs combined with the South Slavic peoples to form a new society.

Typically a transfer case is used to engage (and disengage) the four-wheel drive function. When disengaged, most four-wheel drive systems operate in two wheel drive (engaging just the rear axle and wheels). For that reason two-wheel drive vehicles do not need a transfer case. \nThe transfer case transfers the power from the transmission to the front and rear axles by means of drive shafts. The transfer case synchronizes the rotation of the front and rear wheels so they turn at exactly the same speed. It usually contains two or more sets of gears. It has a 1:1 ratio drive (usually called high range) for normal city and highway use. Then it contains a low range gear for off-road use. A common low range gear ratios is 2.72:1. That means for every 2.72 rotations of the transmission output shaft, the transfer case will turn both driveshafts 1 rotation. The Jeep Wrangler Rubicon model uses a 4:1 low range gearing.\nDrive types.\nThere are two different types of internal power-transfer mechanism found in most transfer cases. \nGear-driven.\nGear-driven transfer cases use sets of gears to transmit power to the front and rear driveshafts. These are generally strong, heavy units that are used in large trucks. There are currently gear drive cases in production for light trucks and SUVs.\nChain-driven.\nChain-driven transfer cases use a chain to transmit power to the axles. Chain-driven transfer cases are quieter, lighter and less expensive to manufacture than gear-driven units. They are used in vehicles such as compact trucks, full size trucks, Jeeps and SUVs. Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven transfer casesto gain the extra strength they provide."}

It was created by Brannon Braga and Adam Simon. The first episode was made public on April 20, 2014. \"Salem\" is WGN America's first scripted series. Janet Montgomery and Shane West are the main actors/actresses of the show. \"Salem\" is influenced by the Salem Witch Trials in the 17th century.\nOverview.\n\"Salem\" is a fictional story that is based on the real Salem Witch Trials in colonial Massachusetts. The Massachusetts government at the time was dominated by conservative Puritan leaders. Unlike today there was little difference between church and state.\nIn 1692 the Puritan colony was affected by young girls \"crying out\" accusations of devil worship against other members of the congregation. A mix of fear and superstition caused a hysteria among the Puritans that devil-worshiping witches were among them. A mob mentality caused people to torture and execute others women (and a few men) for no reason other than hysteria over the possibility of them being witches. Over 150 people were accused of being witches and placed on trial.\nSalem, the WGN America series, reworks this history into a fictional story full of magic, witches as actual beings, and sexy characters. In the TV series the main characters, John Alden (Shane West) and Mary Sibley (Janet Montgomery), find themselves in love even though the whole town is in a frenzy over witch hunts. The New York Times review called it \"perversely entertaining.\"\nCast.\nMost of the characters are based on the names of real people.\nReviews.\nSalem scored 49 out of 100, based on 16 critic reviews on Metacritic. On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season scored 54%, with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10 based on 26 critic reviews. The show was also nominated for two awards."}

Drivetrain loss is the power lost, measured in horsepower, between what the engine generates and what is available at the wheels. As power is transmitted through the drivetrain, forces including inertia, drag and friction cause some power to be wasted. The more component parts power is transmitted through, the more power is lost. However each combination of drivetrain parts is different as to how much is lost. The automatic transmission wastes the most power of any drivetrain component."}

This is usually due to friction, though the use of shear force of the surface is also commonly used.\nTraction can also mean the maximum tractive force between a body and a surface, as limited by available friction. When this is the case, traction is often expressed as the ratio of the maximum tractive force to the normal force and is termed the \"coefficient of traction\" (similar to coefficient of friction).\nMotor vehicles.\nTraction is an important force to motor vehicles. Tires, usually made of rubber, depend on traction to move a vehicle forward. In manual transmission cars and trucks, a clutch is a friction device that connects the engine to the drivetrain of the vehicle. To work properly, the clutch must have traction."}

Most of the action took place in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming.\nThere was a heated rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). They used bribery, theft, and destruction of bones. Each scientist attacked the other in scientific publications, seeking to ruin his credibility and have his funding cut off.\nTheir search for fossils led them west to rich \"bone beds\" in the western United States. From 1877 to 1892, both paleontologists used their wealth and influence. They paid for their own expeditions, and the services and dinosaur bones from fossil hunters. By the end of the Bone Wars, both men had exhausted their funds in this way.\nCope and Marsh were financially and socially ruined by their attempts to disgrace each other. Their contributions to paleontology were massive and provided plenty of material for later work: both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. 142 new species of dinosaurs were discovered and described by them, though today only 32 of their names are valid.\nThe products of the Bone Wars increased our knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs. This led to more fossil excavation in North America in the decades that followed. Several historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.\nBetween them, they discovered some of the most famous fossil sites in North America, such as the Morrison Formation at Como Bluff, Wyoming. The Morrison Formation extends into 13 states, and is still being searched wherever it outcrops onto the surface."}

King and Prowse met each other in 2000 while they were attending the University of Victoria in Victoria. They started going to live shows together regularly in Victoria and Vancouver after they found out that they had a mutual interest in music. In 2003, Prowse moved to Vancouver and transferred to Simon Fraser University. After King graduated in 2005, he moved to Vancouver to form the band with Prowse. The band was influenced by The Sonics and they started writing music in 2006. The band got their name from a combination of two other band name ideas: Japanese Scream and Pleasure Droids.\nThe band self-released two EPs: \"All Lies\" in 2007 and \"Lullaby Death Jams\" in 2008. The EPs were only limited to 500 copies each but were re-released as a compilation titled \"No Singles\" in 2010.\nTheir first studio album titled \"Post-Nothing\" was released on April 28, 2009 through Unfamiliar Records and re-released on August 4, 2009 on Polyvinyl Record Co. In March 2009, the website Pitchfork Media named the song \"Young Hearts Spark Fire\" as a 'Best New Track'. This helped the band gain more recognition outside of Canada.\nThe band's second studio album \"Celebration Rock\" was released on June 5, 2012. The album's first single \"The House That Heaven Built\" was released on May 15, 2012.\nThe album received positive reviews. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork said, \"Japandroids have gone from having almost none at all [lyrics] to packing their songs with an astonishing command of legend and literalism that all but dares you to feel \"something\".\" Spin named Japandroids 2012's \"Band of the Year\" and rated the album a 9 out of 10. Rolling Stone rated it a 4 out of 5 and listed the album as #10 on their \"The 10 Coolest Summer Albums of All Time\" list."}

It uses perfectly cut, completely regular square stone blocks of equal height, and sometimes of the same length.\nIn classical antiquity this technique was perfected and widely used, especially for public buildings (temples, theaters, amphitheaters etc.). One of the most well-known examples is the Parthenon.\nVitruvius briefly described this technique in his De Architectura, 2nd book, 8th chapter as following: \"A wall is called \u201cisodomum\u201c when all the courses are of equal height\".\nVitruvius further states that the stone blocks of opus isodomum are bound together by mortar, but more often they are not connected with mortar but with metal ties such as iron cramps, fixed in stone blocks with molten lead.\nCompletely regular isodomum is relatively rare, especially in the provinces. More frequent is isodomum made of stone blocks of the same height but not of the same length. In order to strengthen this type of wall, builders always take good care that the ends of stone blocks in alternating courses of the wall do not match.\nOpus pseudoisodomum is a version of opus isodomum mentioned by Vitruvius, describing that it is a kind of stonemasonery in which \"the rows of courses do not match but run unequally\", referring to the height and length of the blocks, which are nevertheless still perfectly cut.\nVitruvius considered both types of wall construction as Greek, emphasizing that \"both kinds are strong\"."}

He was elected Leader of the Labour Party in 2015. Corbyn calls himself a democratic socialist.\nCorbyn was born in Chippenham in Wiltshire. Before becoming a politician, he worked as a representative for many trade unions. He was elected to Haringey Council in 1974. He was later secretary of the Islington Constituency Labour Party (CLP). He entered the House of Commons as an MP.\nCorbyn won many awards for his work as an international human rights activist.

It passed by 172 votes to 40 following the resignation of around two-thirds of Corbyn's Shadow cabinet. He then faced a second leadership contest, against Angela Eagle and Owen Smith. However, in July 2016, Eagle dropped out of the race leaving Smith and Corbyn as the only candidates. On 24 September 2016, Corbyn won the leadership contest against Smith with an increased majority of 61.8%.\nAfter the 2017 general election was announced, Corbyn said he was ready to offer a \"real alternative\" to the Conservative government. In the election, the Labour Party gained 32 seats, but the Conservatives remained the largest Party.\nIn 2019, Corbyn created a plan to prevent a no-deal Brexit, which involved creating a temporary caretaker government and then campaigning for a \"public vote on the terms of leaving the European Union, including an option to Remain\". He has publicly criticized antisemitism within the Labour Party, however many believe than Corbyn is responsible for some antisemitic attacks within the party. In the 2019 general election, Labour suffered its worst defeat since 1935, lowering its seats held to just over 200. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, causing a leadership contest, where Sir Keir Starmer won the contest and replaced Corbyn on 4 April 2020.\nCorbyn was suspended from the Labour Party on 29 October 2020 after he said that he would not accept what the Equality and Human Rights Commission found about antisemitism. He was given party membership again a month later, however his party whip remains suspended until February 2021.\nEarly life.\nCorbyn was born at Chippenham Cottage Hospital in Chippenham, Wiltshire. He was raised in Kington St Michael in Wiltshire. The youngest of four sons, he is the brother of Piers Corbyn. His mother, Naomi Josling, was a math teacher. His father, David Benjamin Corbyn was an electrical engineer. His parents were peace activists. When Corbyn was seven, the family moved to Pave Lane in Shropshire, where his father bought Yew Tree Manor (renamed Yew Tree Guesthouse), turning it into a family home.\nCorbyn studied at the Castle House Preparatory School near Newport, Shropshire. He then went to Adams' Grammar School. In school, Corbyn said that he received bad grades and his teacher told him that he was never going to make anything of himself. Corbyn worked as a reporter for a short time for local newspaper, the \"Newport and Market Drayton Advertiser\". He went to the University of North London for a year before dropping out without an educational degree.\nEarly career.\nAt around the age of 19, Corbyn spent two years volunteering in Jamaica as a geography teacher.\nCorbyn worked as an union official of the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers. He became a member of a district health authority in the early years of the 1970s. In 1974, he was elected to Haringey Council, representing Harringay as councillor until 1983. Corbyn worked on Tony Benn's deputy leadership campaign in 1981.\nParliamentary career, 1983\u2013present.\nCorbyn was chosen as the Labour Party candidate for his local seat in Islington North in 1982. Around this time, he became involved with \"London Labour Briefing\", where he was a contributor and member of the editorial board during the 1980s. It has been reported that he served as its general secretary for some time.\nIn 1983, he was elected Member of Parliament for Islington North. After winning, he joined the Socialist Campaign Group. He sat on the Parliamentary London Regional Select Committee from 1983 to 1987. He sat on the Social Security Select Committee from 1992 to 1997, the London Regional Select Committee for a second time from 2009 to 2010, and the Justice Select Committee from 2010 to 2015.\nCorbyn has won re-elections as Member of Parliament for Islington North seven times. In the 2015 election, when he won 60.24% of the votes cast and a majority of 21,194. During his career, he voted against the whip 428 times while Labour was in power.\nIn 1990, Corbyn almost went to jail for not paying his taxes as protest to a new tax system in Scotland.\nIn October 2001, Corbyn was elected to the steering committee of the Stop the War Coalition, which was formed to oppose the Afghanistan War which started later that year. He helped organise the February anti-Iraq War protest which was claimed to be the largest such protest in British political history. In 2006, Corbyn was one of 12 Labour MPs to support Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party's call for a parliamentary inquiry into the Iraq War. He was elected chair of the coalition in succession to Andrew Murray in September 2011, but resigned in September 2015.\nCorbyn has always opposed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and is a long-time supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). He was criticised for inviting Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn F\u00e9in to the Palace of Westminster in 1984, weeks after the Brighton hotel bombing by the PIRA.\nCorbyn was chair of the All-party parliamentary group (APPG) on the Chagos Islands, chair of the APPG on Mexico, Vice-Chair of the APPG on Latin America and vice-chair of the APPG on human rights. He has supported the rights for the Chagossians. He is known for his Venezuelan solidarity activism.\nLeadership of the Labour Party, 2015\u20132020.\nLeadership election.\nFollowing the Labour Party's defeat at the general election on 7 May 2015, Ed Miliband resigned as its party leader. His resignation caused the party to have a leadership election.\nOn 2 June, it was reported in media sources that Corbyn was thinking of applying to be a candidate. The next day, Corbyn announced to his local newspaper, \"The Islington Tribune\", that he would become a candidate in the election. Before he could become a candidate he had to secure at least 35 nominations from MPs. In the end he got 36. Some of the MPs who nominated him didn't think he would win and only nominated him to have a 'broader debate'.\nSome, including former foreign secretary Margaret Becket, told journalists they regretted the decision. When he was accepted as a candidate Corbyn said: \"This decision is in response to an overwhelming call by Labour Party members who want to see a broader range of candidates and a thorough debate about the future of the party. I am standing to give Labour Party members a voice in this debate\". He would run against candidates Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham and Liz Kendall.\nCorbyn was elected party leader in a landslide victory on 12 September 2015 with 59.5% of first-preference votes in the first round of voting. It has been said that Corbyn would have won in the first round with 51% of votes. Corbyn's 40.5% majority was larger than that won by Tony Blair in 1994.\nLeader of the Opposition.\nAfter being elected leader on 12 September 2015, Corbyn became Leader of the Official Opposition. On 14 September 2015, his seat in the Privy Council was announced. During his time as leader, Corbyn wanted to stop the \"theatrical\" nature of the House of Commons. His first months as leader was called as \"a good start\" and a \"long overdue\" change by \"The Guardian\". He made his first annual address as leader on 29 September 2015. As Leader of the Opposition, he was made a member of the Privy Council on 11 November 2015. The phrase, \"Corbynmania\", is used for the large amount of support given by his supporters.\nOn 16 June 2016, MP Jo Cox was assassinated after being stabbed multiple times by far-right supporter Thomas Mair. In the aftermath of the assassination, Corbyn described Cox as someone who was \"dedicated to getting us to live up to our promises to support the developing world and strengthen human rights\".\nIn June 2017, Corbyn made an appearance at the 2017 Glastonbury Festival, where he addressed the crowd. The crowd chanted \"Oh, Jeremy Corbyn\" and sang to the tune of \"Seven Nation Army\", a song by The White Stripes. Corbyn talked about the importance of young people going out and vote.\nMilitary intervention in Syria.\nAfter members of ISIS carried out terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Corbyn said that the only way to deal with the threat by ISIS would be to reach a political settlement and ending the Syrian Civil War. Corbyn voted against military power and airstrikes on ISIS.\nEU referendum results and cabinet resignations.\nIn June 2016, Corbyn said he supported the United Kingdom staying in the European Union. After the United Kingdom voted on leaving the European Union, many Labour leaders wanted Corbyn to resign.\nAfter the referendum, many members of Corbyn's Shadow cabinet resigned because they did not like Corbyn's leadership. Hilary Benn called Corbyn to tell him that he had \"lost confidence\" in his leadership. Corbyn later asked for his resignation from the Shadow Cabinet on 26 June. Heidi Alexander resigned from the Shadow Cabinet hours later, followed by Gloria de Piero, Ian Murray, Lilian Greenwood, Lucy Powell, Kerry McCarthy, Seema Malhotra, Vernon Coaker, Charlie Falconer, and Chris Bryant. Other Shadow Cabinet Ministers, including John McDonnell, Andy Burnham, Diane Abbott, Jon Trickett, Angela Smith, Emily Thornberry and Lord Bassam of Brighton have either supported Corbyn's leadership directly or have said that it was not a good time for a \"rebellion\". By mid-afternoon 27 June 2016, 23 of the 31 shadow cabinet members had resigned their roles as did seven parliamentary private secretaries.\nLeadership crisis.\nOn 28 June 2016, he lost the vote of confidence by Labour Party MPs by 172\u201340. He said with a statement that the motion had no \"constitutional legitimacy\" and that he intended to continue as the elected leader.\nA YouGov poll of Labour party members found that about 50% expected to support Corbyn if a leadership ballot was called. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who did not take a side in the dispute, said \"When Labour splits, when we're divided, we lose elections\". The division between Corbyn and the Labour parliamentary party continued.\nOn 11 July 2016, Angela Eagle announced her candidacy to run against Corbyn in the upcoming 2016 Labour Party leadership election. On 13 July former shadow minister Owen Smith also announced his leadership challenge. On the 19 July, Eagle quit the race after Smith got 90 nominations to her 70. Eagle said she resigned 'in the best interests of the party.' This was because having two anti Corbyn candidates in the race could split the vote and give him a better chance of winning.\nOn 24 September 2016, following the leadership contest, Corbyn was re-elected as the leader of the party again with an increased majority of 61.8%.\nResponse to the Chilcot report.\nThe Chilcot report of the Iraq Inquiry was issued on 6 July 2016. It criticised the former Labour PM Tony Blair for joining the United States in the war against Iraq. Corbyn was against the war in Iraq. In response, Corbyn apologised to the people of Iraq, families of British soldiers who died and to the British people.\nDonald Trump.\nAfter the election of Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential elections, Corbyn said that he believes that Trump is not solving problems, but dividing the United States. Corbyn also said he supports the idea for Trump to be banned from visiting the United Kingdom over his executive order on banning visitors from certain majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.\nIn June 2019, Corbyn refused an invitation to attend a state banquet for Donald Trump, hosted by Queen Elizabeth II during the president's June visit to the United Kingdom. Corbyn then attended a London protest outside Trump and May's joint press conference and requested a meeting with Trump to talk about issues such as the \"climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis\". Trump rejected the request, saying that Corbyn was a \"negative force\".\nArticle 50.\nIn January 2017, Corbyn announced that he would support a three-line plan to force Labour MPs in support of triggering Article 50, which would start the removal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In response, many Labour members said they would vote against the bill. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow minister for early years, and Jo Stevens, the Shadow Welsh Secretary resigned in protest. On 1 February, forty seven Labour MPs went against Corbyn's plan on the second reading of the bill.\nMay 2017 local elections.\nAt the 2017 local elections in May, Labour under Corbyn lost almost 400 councillors and control of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire county council. The BBC's Projected National Vote Share was 38% for the\u00a0Conservatives, 27% for\u00a0Labour, 18% for the\u00a0Liberal Democrats\u00a0and 5% for\u00a0UKIP, with others on around 12%.\n2017 general election.\nCorbyn said he supported Prime Minister Theresa May's idea for an early general election while awaiting parliamentary approval. He said he would urge his party to support the government's move in the parliamentary vote announced for on 19 April. A majority of MPs is necessary for a general election to be called before 2020.\nMany people supported Corbyn to become Prime Minister such as United States senator Bernie Sanders, who Corbyn supported when Sanders ran for President of the United States.\nIn the snap general election, Labour under Corbyn gained 32 seats and increased its share of the popular vote to 40%, though the Conservative Party remained in government.\nAfter the 2017 general election.\nAfter the 2017 election, a poll put Labour on 45% with the Conservatives on 39%, the first poll to show Labour ahead with Corbyn as leader. 4% more voters approve of Corbyn than disapprove. Corbyn announced that the party was being placed on \"permanent campaign mode\", hoping for another general election to be called as soon as fall 2017. He began a number of rallies in important seats, including Hastings and Rye, Southampton Itchen and Bournemouth West.\nAfter Theresa May's Brexit proposal failed in the House of Commons on 15 January 2019, Corbyn filled a motion of no confidence towards the May ministry. The motion failed in a 325 to 306 vote.\nIn March 2019, Corbyn was assaulted by a Brexit supporter outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London. His attacker was sentenced to 28 days in jail. In March 2019, Corbyn said that he could vote leave in a second referendum, depending on the Brexit deal on offer.\nAt the end of Theresa May's time as Prime Minister, she had a small lead over Corbyn in the best Prime Minister polling question. However, following the appointment of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister in July 2019, he gained double-digit leads over Corbyn on this question, although he was seen to be \"more in touch\" with ordinary people than Johnson.\nJune 2017 Shadow Cabinet.\nA year after most of his Shadow Cabinet resigned, Corbyn removed three Shadow Cabinet members and a fourth resigned. This was after they went against the Labour Party's orders to not vote on the motion aimed at keeping the United Kingdom in the European Union single market.\nAntisemitism accusations.\nIn March 2018, it was revealed that Labour Party members, including Corbyn, some of his office staff and MPs belonged to a secret Facebook group where antisemitic comments were freely made. He left the group after becoming Labour leader in 2015.\nAccording to the \"Huffington Post\" he was enrolled by someone else in 2014 and had only made a small number of posts.\nLater in March 2018, a spokesman for the Labour leader admitted Corbyn had posted a comment on Facebook in 2012 questioning the removal of an allegedly antisemitic mural in London. This became controversial with Corbyn releasing a statement that said: \u201cI sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and antisemitic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of antisemitism in any form. That is a view I\u2019ve always held.\u201d.\nIn February 2019, seven MPs resigned from the Labour Party to form an Independent group because of Corbyn's handling of Brexit and of allegations of antisemitism.\n2019 general election and resignation.\nOn 29 October 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the next general election would be held on 12 December 2019. The reason was so that Conservatives could win a majority in parliament to pass a Brexit bill. Labour were left with just over 200 seats, their worst result since 1935. However, the party's share of the vote was higher than in 2015 and 2010. Conservatives won seats in England and Wales that were traditionally Labour seats, in a move the British media called: \"a realignment of UK politics\".\nAfter the Labour Party's had massive losses in the election, Corbyn stated that he plans to step down following a period of reflection causing a leadership contest. Corbyn said that he had \"pride in the manifesto\" that Labour put forward for the election and blamed the defeat on Brexit. \nOn 3 April 2020, in a final message to Labour Party members while leader of the party, Corbyn said, \"I can assure you my voice will not be stilled. I\u2019ll be out there campaigning for socialism, peace and justice, and I feel sure we\u2019ll be doing that together.\" He also claimed that Labour in the last five years under his leadership had \"changed the agenda on austerity and how the economy is run\".\nOn 4 April 2020, Sir Keir Starmer replaced Corbyn as Opposition Leader and Labour Party Leader.\nAfter a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Labour Party suspended Corbyn in October 2020. They did this because he said that he would not accept what the report had found. On 17 November 2020, Corbyn was given a formal warning and was given party membership again. Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has not yet give Corbyn party-related responsibilites again. On 26 November, Corbyn's lawyers pushed for legal action against the Labour Party for suspending Corbyn's party whip. Corbyn's claim is that he and Starmer had agreed to a deal to readmit him to the party. His party duties will be suspended at least until February 2021 until an investigation into Corbyn's anti-Semitism accusations can finish.\nPost-leadership activities.\nOn 13 December 2020, Corbyn announced that he would be creating the Project for Peace and Justice the following month. It would focus on environmentalism, international peace, poverty, social inequality and corporation power. Corbyn launched the Project on 17 January 2021.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1974, Corbyn married Jane Chapman. They divorced in 1979. In 1987, Corbyn married Chilean-born Claudia Bracchitta. They had three sons. They divorced in 1999. Corbyn said in June 2015 that he continues to \"get on very well\" with his former wife. In 2013, Corbyn married Laura \u00c1lvarez. He lives in Finsbury Park in London.\nIn an interview by \"The Huffington Post\" in December 2015, Corbyn did not want to say what his religion was, saying that it is a \"private thing\", while saying that he was not an atheist.\nCultural impact.\nIn January 2016 it was announced that a satirical musical based on Corbyn's life would be staged at the Waterloo East Theatre in London later in the year. BBC News suggested that \"Corbyn the Musical: The Motorcycle Diaries\" \"may be the first stage show written about a leader of the opposition\".\nPolitical views.\nCorbyn has been against Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and supported a higher rate of income tax for the richest in society. He wants to stop tax evasion by adding \u00a31 billion in HM Revenue and Customs.\nCorbyn has said that the National Health Service (NHS) should be \"completely publicly run and publicly accountable\". He is a supporter of the NHS Reinstatement Bill 2015. Corbyn does not support the Private Finance Initiative.\nCorbyn did not support sending British troops to retake the Falkland Islands. He called it a \"nauseating waste of lives and money\".\nCorbyn has supported same-sex marriage and LGBT rights. Corbyn voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, that allowed same-sex marriage in England and Wales. He has been a longtime environmentalist and does not support hydraulic fracturing. Corbyn is a supporter of animal rights. He also supports re-nationalisation of the UK's train system, meaning they will be owned and run by the government and not by businesses."}

{"id": "513935", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513935", "title": "Ancient Egyptian royal titles", "text": "The Ancient Egyptian royal titles were a standard way of naming the pharaohs, the kings of Ancient Egypt. These names and titles showed the king's worldly and religious powers. The names could provide a sort of mission statement for the king. Names and titles sometimes changed during the reign.\nBy the Middle Kingdom the pharaohs used a set of five titles. The full set of titles, the titulary, using the five names, became the standard and were still in use as late as the Roman Empire.\nHorus name.\nG5-O33\nThe Horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh's name. It began in the Predynastic Period. Many of the oldest-known Egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title.\nThe Horus name was usually written inside a serekh. This was a symbol of a palace fa\u00e7ade. The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside the serekh. Usually there would be an image of the falcon God Horus on top or beside it.\nOne Egyptian ruler, the 2nd dynasty Seth-Peribsen, used an image of the god Seth instead of Horus. Perhaps this was showing there had been some kind of religious division within the country. He was succeeded by Khasekhemwy, who placed the symbols of both Set and Horus above his name. Later kings always had the image of Horus beside their name.\nBy the time of the New Kingdom the Horus name was often written without the enclosing serekh.\nNebty (\"two ladies\") name.\nG16\nThe Nebty name, meaning \"two ladies\", was linked with the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt:\nThe name is first definitively used by the First Dynasty pharaoh Semerkhet. It became an independent title by the Twelfth Dynasty.\nThe Nebty name was not usually framed by a cartouche or serekh. It always begins with the hieroglyphs of a vulture and cobra resting upon two baskets, the dual noun \"nebty\".\nHorus of Gold.\nG8\nThis was also known as the \"Golden Horus Name\". The pharaoh's name featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold.\nThe meaning of this title has been disputed. It could show the triumph of Horus over his uncle Seth, the symbol for gold meaning that Horus was \"superior to his foes\". Gold also was linked with ideas of eternity, so name may show the pharaoh's eternal Horus name.\nLike the Nebty name, this name was not framed by a cartouche or serekh.\nThrone name (\"prenomen\").\nM23:t-L2:t\nThe pharaoh's throne name, the first of the two names written inside a cartouche, with the title \"nsw-bity\" (\"nesu-bity, nesw-bit, nswt-bjtj\").\nIt means \"S/He of the Sedge and Bee\". This is often translated as \"King of Upper and of Lower Egypt\", as the sedge and bee were symbols for Upper and Lower Egypt.\nThe term \"nsw-bity\" may be from the Berber word for \"strong man; ruler\".(Schneider 1993)\nThe epithet \"neb tawy\", \"Lord of the Two Lands\", meaning the valley and delta regions of Egypt was also often used.\nPersonal name (\"nomen\").\nG39-N5:.-\nThis was the name given to the pharaoh at birth. The name itself was preceded by the title \"Son of Ra\". This was written with the hieroglyph of a duck (\"za\"), a homonym for the word meaning \"son\" (\"za\"), next to an image of the sun, a hieroglyph god Ra. It was first introduced to the set of royal titles in the Fourth Dynasty and emphasizes the king's role as a representative of the solar god Ra. When the pharaoh was woman, the preceding title was interpreted as \"daughter\".\nModern historians usually use this name for the ancient kings of Egypt, adding ordinals (e.g. \"II\", \"III\") for different individuals with the same name.\nExamples of the full titulary.\nSenusret I.\nIn the Middle Kingdom, the full titulary was sometimes written in a single cartouche. This example is from Senusret I, from Beni Hasan.\nHatshepsut.\nThe full titulary of Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Hatshepsut. This has a guide to pronunciation and the meanings, and shows the differences when the pharaoh is a woman:\nThutmose III.\nThe full titulary of Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Thutmose III, with a guide to pronunciation and meaning:"}

Low rainfall is a feature of deserts such as the Arabian, central Australia and the Sahara. It is a feature of continental interiors, the western sides of continents, and the leeward side of tall mountain ranges. Parts of the Arctic and Antarctic have arid climates even though they are cold. \nDefining a desert.\nA \"true desert\" is one where plant cover is very sparse and rainfall is rare or infrequent. Because desert air is dry there is little moisture to hold onto the heat of the day. Desert nights are usually very cold. This wide temperature variation can make a desert climate difficult to live in.\nSome deserts get more than 250mm of rainfall yearly but are still arid areas. For example, the Kalahari Desert gets up to a year. It has great sand dunes like the Sahara, but they do not shift in the winds. They have plants that anchor the sand and help to keep their shape. Other areas can also have more than 250mm of precipitation but lose more water via evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation. Tuscon and Alice Springs are good examples of this. Tucson gets an average of of rainfall a year. Alice Springs receives about yearly. Some scientists do not consider these as true deserts. \nTypes.\nThere are three types of desert climates in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification: a hot desert climate (BWh), a cold desert climate (BWk) and a mild desert climate (BWh/BWn). Hot deserts have very hot summers that have temperatures that can even reach 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F). Temperatures can even be very warm during winter. Cold deserts can have hot summers as well, but the winters are usually very cold. They are usually at high altitudes and can be drier than hot deserts.\nAdaptations.\nDesert plants and animals have adapted to living in desert climates. Some animals can get by on less water. Some plants are able to store water. Some animals, like snakes, lizards and scorpions use poisonous venoms to kill for food. This saves valuable energy: they do not need to chase, fight or catch their prey. Many animals are nocturnal. They sleep in cool caves or burrows during the day and hunt at night. Plants likewise have adapted to saving water. Some have waterproof coverings that prevent the plant or seeds from drying out. Some, like the giant Saguaro cactus, store water. They have adapted so well that they can live for more than 150\u00a0years and can average over 40\u00a0ft tall. Many types have thorns and protective spines that keep animals from getting at their stores of water."}

Upward graduated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1925 with a degree in English. He became a teacher which also allowed him time to write. \nWriting career.\nIn 1931 he became interested in the Communist Party. He joined the party in 1934. He wrote for several Left-wing journals. These included \"New Country\", \"The Left Review\" and \"New Writing\". Upward's first novel was \"Journey to the Border\", published in 1938. At that time Upward was better known for a 1937 essay called \"Sketch for a Marxist Interpretation of Literature\". He wrote a trilogy called \"The Spiral Ascent\". The second part had trouble getting published. By the time the third part was published, it had to be underwritten by the Action Council. The council only agreed after pressure from Upward's friends. The three were titled \"In the Thirties\" (1962), \"The Rotten Elements\" (1969), and \"No Home But the Struggle\" (1977). The last two were almost completely ignored at the time. \nHe enjoyed a resurgence in his nineties with the publication of several of his short stories. These were \"The Mortmere Stories\" (co-written with Christopher Isherwood during their time at Cambridge in the 1920s), \"An Unmentionable Man\" (1994), \"The Scenic Railway\" (1997), \"The Coming Day\" (2000), and \"A Renegade in Springtime\" (2003), the last to celebrate his 100th birthday. \nHe died on 13 February 2009, aged 105, in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, England.\nOther websites.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It is also called vengeance, vendetta, payback, retribution or retaliation. It can also be doing something to get even for an insult, real or perceived. Vengeance is as old as people are. it is a natural urge that has been examined by psychologists, philosophers, legal scholars, poets, playwrights and others. Anthropologists have discovered chimpanzees will try to get revenge on thieves who steal their food.\nThe psychology of revenge.\nIn a 2004 issue of Science, Swiss researchers scanned the brains of several subjects who had been intentionally \"wronged\" in an experiment. They were then given a chance to get even with the person they thought wronged them. As they thought about how they could get revenge, their brain activity showed a rush of rush of activity in the caudate nucleus. This is the part of the brain that processes rewards. This gives some psychological confirmation to the saying \"Revenge is sweet\".\nPitfalls of revenge.\nThe ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius said: \"\"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.\" \"Payback's a bitch!\" is the more modern version. The person seeking revenge is often hurt as badly as his victim. Often, the one seeking revenge has to take on the very qualities he or she hated in the first place.\nIt becomes a case of \"you hurt me, I'll hurt you back\". Taking revenge on someone may cause them to retaliate and take revenge on you. This process keeps going back and forth until it becomes a blood feud involving families, tribes, even nations. On a world level, feuds have been going on for centuries. A desire for revenge comes from a shared human desire for justice. But revenge twists justice into what is needed at the moment.\nGrowing evidence shows abused children often inflict revenge on themselves and those around them. By not experiencing a healthy development they do not have a healthy sense of justice. By not having developed a healthy understanding of interpersonal relationships, it can lead to criminal behavior. Studies of Juvenile delinquents and inmates shows a strong connection between criminal behavior and a history of being abused as a child. As teens, many engage in revenge fantasies.\nRelated terms.\nSometimes revenge or acts of revenge are actually other feelings disguised as revenge. "}

It was grown in Cornwall in England, to become the 'Cornish pepperleaf' (associated with Cornish cuisine). It has large, peppery berries which are also high in antioxidants. But due to the presence of safrole, safrole-free strains of mountain pepper are selected for the spice trade. \nDorrigo pepper (\"Tasmannia stipitata\") was the original pepper bush present in specialty foods restaurants in the 1980s.

It lies between the Chukchi Sea and East Siberian Sea. Wrangel Island lies across the 180\u00b0 meridian. The International Date Line is displaced eastwards at this latitude to avoid the island and the Chukchi Peninsula on the Russian mainland. It is roughly (about the size of the US state of Delaware). The closest land to Wrangel Island is tiny and rocky Herald Island located to the east. The distance to the closest point on the Siberian mainland is . Wrangel Island may have been the last place on earth where Woolly Mammoth survived. It is home to many arctic animals including polar bears. Since 1976 it has been a nature reserve.\nHistory.\nBaron Ferdinand von Wrangel (1796\u20131870) was a German explorer and seaman in the service of the Russian Empire. He noticed birds flying north near the Kolyma river. From this he correctly deduced there was an island in the Arctic ocean. He searched for the island in the 1820s but never found it. \nIn 1881 an American steamship, the \"Thomas L. Corwin\", searching for a lost expedition found themselves off Wrangel island. They searched the island for survivors but found none. They raised an American flag on the and claimed it for the United States. They named it \"New Columbia\", but the name never stuck. Nothing was done about the discovery for the next 30 years.\nIn 1913, Vilhjalmur Stefansson led a large expedition to discover a lost continent he believed was under the Arctic ice cap. They sailed from Victoria, British Columbia on June 17, 1913. Six weeks later their ship was caught in the ice. Stefansson and several companions left the expedition and returned to safety. When the ship was crushed, the crew set up camp on the ice. In March of 1914, Captain Bartlett led what was left of his crew 80 miles across the ice to Wrangel Island. Twelve survivors were picked up by a small whaling schooner in September of 1914. \nIn 1921, Stefansson claimed Wrangel island for Canada. An expedition from Canada to colonize the island failed. By 1926 Russia re-established their claim to the island by setting up a colony there. Eventually the colonists returned to the mainland leaving the island deserted.\nIn 1976 the Soviet Union declared the island a \"zapovednika\", a federally protected nature reserve. In English it is called the Wrangel Island Nature Reserve. It protects large colonies of snow geese, polar bears, and walrus that live here. Only official Russian government personnel and invited guests can visit the reserve.\nGal\u00e1pagos of the far north.\nWrangel island was never covered by glaciers during the last ice ages and it was never covered by water when the ice retreated. The soil and plants on Wrangel have been undisturbed by time. The interior valleys are mainly ancient Pleistocene tundra. They boast over 400 unique plant species.\nWildlife.\nEven though it is a very harsh climate Wrangel island has a large and diverse wildlife population. It is the world's largest Polar Bear denning ground. There are about 400 female bears who raise their young here. It has the world's largest population of Pacific Walrus. The island has large populations of Snow Geese, Snowy Owls, seals, Arctic wolves, Arctic fox and lemmings. One thing the island seems to be missing is mosquitoes.\nWoolly Mammoths.\nWrangel island may have been the last place Woolly Mammoths (\"Mammuthus primigenius\") existed before becoming extinct. The island is littered with mammoth tusks. A population of mammoths existed here some 6,000 years after they went extinct on the mainland. They lasted until about 1650 BCE, when the Great Pyramids of Giza were already 1000 years old. Archaeological evidence on the island shows them to be a smaller variety, \"Mammuth primigenius wrangelensis\"."}

The study of honey bees is known as 'melittology'.\nThe first \"Apis\" bees appear in the European fossil record at the Eocene\u2013Oligocene boundary (34 million years ago). This shows that the bees were present in Europe by that time. Few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin.\nNo \"Apis\" species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of \"A. mellifera\" by Europeans. Only one fossil species is known, a single 14-million-year-old specimen from Nevada.\nThe close relatives of modern honey bees\u00a0\u2013 bumblebees and stingless bees\u00a0\u2013 are also social, but with smaller numbers in their families.\nAll honey bees (and perhaps all bees) use scent as a way to co-ordinate their activities.

It is about long. The St. Croix flows in the U.S. states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. The lower of the river forms the border between Wisconsin and Minnesota. The river is a National Scenic Riverway under the protection of the National Park Service. A hydroelectric plant at St. Croix Falls supplies electricity to the Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul metropolitan area.\nNaming.\nFather Louis Hennepin wrote in 1683, from information probably provided by Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut: \"There is another River which falls ... into the Meschasipi ... We named it \"The River of the Grave\", or \"Mausoleum\", because the Savages buried there one of their Men ... who was bitten by a Rattlesnake.\" Father Hennepin called it in French \"Rivi\u00e8re du Tombeaux\".\nThere are several possible explanations for the origin of the present name. An early map dated to 1688 recorded a \"Fort St. Croix\" on the upper part of the river. Near the mouth of the river was a French Voyageur's grave marked with a cross. The most likely explanation was that it was named for a French trader named Sainte-Croix.\nThe name \"Rivi\u00e8re de Sainte-Croix\" was applied to the river sometime in 1688 or 1689.\nOn \"Map of the Territories of Michigan and Ouisconsin\" (1830) by John Farmer, the St. Croix River is shown as the \"Chippewa River\". However, by 1843, Joseph Nicollet's \"Hydrographical Basin of the Upper Mississippi River\" reinforced the name provided by Franquelin's 1688 map.\nHistory.\nThe river valley and the surrounding area was originally occupied by the Ojibwe, Dakota and nine other American Indian tribes. The Indians mainly lived on wild rice, fish, and game. By the eighteenth century, the Ojibwe and Dakota were the two main tribes that inhabited the area. This lasted until around 1745, when the Dakota were driven from the St. Croix Valley as a result of the Battle of Kathio. It is worth noting that many Dakota and Ojibwe people still occupy this area to this day, as it is particularly considered a part of Dakota homeland. \nFur trade.\nThe first Europeans to arrive in the area were Sieur du Lhut and his men in the fall and winter of 1679-1680. For the next eighty years the area was mainly under French influence. The fur trade grew throughout the first half of the eighteenth century. Beaver pelts were one of the main products. French trade in the upper valley was dominated by the Ojibwe. They were tied to Lake Superior traders. In the lower valley the Dakota assisted in trading with merchants based out of St. Louis. After the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, British traders entered the area. They grew in numbers and influence with the help of the powerful North West Company.\nLogging.\nThe 1837 Treaty of St. Peters with the Ojibwe gave the United States government a large tract of land in what today is north central Wisconsin and east central Minnesota. This opened the region to logging. The river was important to float the logs downstream to the sawmills that processed it. During the 1840s, important sawmills were located at St. Croix Falls and Marine on St. Croix. In the 1850s Stillwater became the primary lumber destination. During this time the population of Stillwater grew rapidly. New sawmills were opened, and the town saw an influx of capital, primarily from lumber companies based in St. Louis. In 1856 construction began on a boom site two miles north of Stillwater. It was used to hold and sort the logs floating downstream. The boom was in operation for over fifty years. The St. Croix Boom Site is now a wayside rest and National Historic Landmark along Minnesota State Highway 95.\nThere were vast white pine forests in the upper St. Croix river valley. They provided the forest products that built the towns along Lake St. Croix, Minneapolis and St. Paul. The St. Croix along with the forests in Red Cedar, Chippewa, and Rum valleys provided supplies for the building of Winona, Minnesota, Davenport, Iowa, Rock Island, Illinois, and St. Louis.\nThe lumber industry continued to grow throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, with larger log drives in the spring caused dangers to navigation on the river above Stillwater. Logs were frequently caught in log jams at the narrow parts of the St. Croix River near St. Croix Falls. In 1883 the blockade was so severe it took almost two months before the flow of logs was re-established. At its peak in 1890, logging in the St. Croix River valley produced of lumber and logs. The lumber industry continued until the last major log drive in 1912 marked the end of the rich white pine forests of the area.\nIt was along the banks of the St. Croix, in the milltown of Stillwater, that the state of Minnesota was first proposed in 1848.\nGeography and hydrography.\nThe St. Croix River starts in the northwestern corner of Wisconsin. It flows out of Upper St. Croix Lake in Douglas County. The lake is near Solon Springs, approximately south of Lake Superior. The St. Croix flows south into Gordon, then southwest. It is joined by the Namekagon River in northern Burnett County. A few miles downstream the St. Croix meets the boundary between Minnesota and Wisconsin. It marks that boundary for another until its confluence with the Mississippi River.\nConservation efforts.\nThe St. Croix River was one of the original eight rivers to be protected by the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. The upper parts of the river for the first and the Namekagon River are protected as the \"St. Croix National Scenic Riverway\". The only interruption is a hydroelectric dam operated by the Northern States Power Company at St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. The lower , including both sides of the river along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border, were protected as part of the \"Lower St. Croix National Scenic Riverway\". "}

They allowed settlement in the St. Croix River Valley. The town was founded by settlers drawn by the area's then-abundant lumber and river traffic. It is one of Minnesota's oldest towns, preceding Minneapolis by several years. Stillwater was officially incorporated as a city on March 4, 1854 (the same day as St. Paul). The city was named for the calm waters of the St. Croix River.\n \nTerritorial convention.\nStillwater is often called the birthplace of Minnesota. In 1848, a territorial convention that began the process of establishing Minnesota as a state was held in Stillwater. The convention selected three leading Minnesota cities as locations for three important public institutions. Minneapolis got the University of Minnesota, Saint Paul became the capital, and Stillwater was chosen as the site of the territory's first prison. The Minnesota Territorial Prison was opened in 1853.\nLumbering era.\nLumbering was the main industry in the St. Croix River Valley in the second half of the nineteenth century. For many years logs were sent down the St. Croix river, collected at the St. Croix Boom Site two miles upstream of Stillwater, and processed in Stillwater's many sawmills. Steamboats were used most widely from 1860 to 1890, and a few are still used for entertainment today. \nCivil war.\nStillwater sent men of the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Company B and the 8th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment Company C to fight during the American Civil War.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

As of the 2010 United States census, its population was 12,719. It is part of the Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Hudson is bordered on the north by the village of North Hudson and the Willow River. On the North and East is the township of Hudson. To the south is the township of Troy. It is bounded on the west by the St. Croix River.\nHistory.\nHudson was settled in the summer of 1840 by Louis Massey and his brother in-law, Peter Bouchea. William Steets arrived at about the same time. Later that same year, Joseph Sauperson (commonly known as Joe LaGrue) moved there. These four are considered Hudson's original inhabitants. Massey and Bouchea settled at the mouth of the Willow River, near the present-day First and St. Croix Streets. They had been part of the group who lived for some time along the river below Fort Snelling. This appears on some old maps as \"Massey's Landing\". The 1840s saw a few settlers arriving here \u2014 Captain John Page, the Nobles brothers, Dr. Philip Aldrich, Ammah Andrews, Moses Perrin, Colonel James Hughes, Daniel Anderson, and others.\nHudson was originally called \"Willow River\". It was later named \"Buena Vista\" by Judge Joel Foster, founder of River Falls. This was after he returned from the Mexican\u2013American War where he fought in the Battle of Buena Vista. In 1852, Alfred D. Gray, Hudson's first mayor, petitioned to change the name of the city to \"Hudson\", because the bluffs along the St. Croix River reminded him of the Hudson River in his native New York.\nA large number of settlers arrived in the 1850s and 1860s. Many of were the ancestors of today's residents. The lumber industry was the prime attraction of the area. Over time sawmills were started throughout the St. Croix Valley.\nOn August 30, 1917 a violent mob of 1,000 held a night rally in front of the armory. They were protesting the attempt by the pacifist People's Council of America to hold a conference in Hudson's prizefighting arena. The crowd then went after the four wiktorganizers in the lobby of their hotel and threatened to hang them. Only after the pleadings of county attorney N. O. Varnum were the four allowed to leave town.\nU.S. Highway 12 once crossed the St. Croix River on a toll bridge between Wisconsin and Minnesota, which provided revenue for the town. With the construction of Interstate 94, the toll bridge was removed. The long causeway extending to the former bridge location is now open to the public as a pedestrian walkway.\nHudson has grown as a tourist destination in recent years. There are shops and restaurants on the St. Croix river in its historic downtown, along with hotels and other businesses that serve traffic on Interstate Highway 94."}

He was born in San Antonio, Texas. He was a child prodigy in country music. He later became best known in roots rock, tejano music, Americana and other genres. \nHe was the lead singer of a popular 1960s rock and roll band, the Sir Douglas Quintet. He later formed a Tex Mex band with Augie Meyers, Freddy Fender and Flaco Jimenez. \nEarly life.\nSahm started his musical career singing and playing steel guitar, mandolin and violin. He first sang on the radio at age five. He recorded his first song, \"A\nReal American Joe\", at age eleven. On December 19, 1952, when he was eleven, he played on stage with Hank Williams Sr. at the Skyline Club in Austin, Texas. It was Hank Williams's last time playing. He died on New Year's Day of 1953. He died of heart failure while on the road to his next show in Canton, Ohio. \nWhen he was thirteen, Sahm was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry, but his mother wanted him to finish junior high school. When he was a teenager, he started sneaking into San Antonio rhythm and blues bars to play music.\nSir Douglas Quintet.\nIn 1965, Sahm formed the band, Sir Douglas Quintet, with a childhood friend, Augie Meyers. A record producer picked the band's name so they would seem British. At the time, music from Britain was so popular in the United States, it had a name: \"British invasion\". The British name only helped a little. Sahm had a Texas accent and two band members were Hispanic. Some early photographs of the band tried to hide this from music fans.\nThe band had a Top Twenty US hit with \"She's About a Mover\". It also made the Top Twenty in the UK Singles Chart. \nBob Dylan liked the group's sound and said: \"Look, for me right now there are three groups: Butterfield Blues Band, The Byrds and the Sir Douglas Quintet.\"\nThe band broke up after an arrest for having marijuana, in Corpus Christi, Texas. \n1970s.\nAfter the breakup, Sahm moved to San Francisco to begin a blues band. Later, he and Augie Meyers got back together as Sir Douglas Quintet, with new members. They recorded a successful album and single, both named \"Mendocino\". \nIn 1973, Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records produced Sahm's first solo album, \"Doug Sahm and Band\". Bob Dylan, Dr. John and Flaco Jim\u00e9nez also played on the album. Wexler said: \"Then in October 1972, Dylan was in the studio with Doug Sahm... Dylan having been friendly with Sahm since the mid-sixties and having expressed enthusiasm for the Sir Douglas Quintet on more than one occasion\".\nSahm also played on recordings by other artists during this time, including The Grateful Dead and Willie Nelson.\nTexas Tornados.\nIn 1989, Sahm started the Tex-Mex supergroup, the Texas Tornados, with Freddy Fender, Augie Meyers, and Flaco Jimenez. They recorded seven albums. These included two live ones, and a \"Best of\" collection. Their first album won a Grammy for Best Mexican-American Performance for their song \"Soy de San Luis\", in 1991. \nSahm played on the 1993 Uncle Tupelo album \"Anodyne\", on the song \"Give Back the Key to my Heart\". He also recorded a Grammy-winning solo album, \"The Last Real Texas Blues Band\", in 1994.\nDeath and tributes.\nSahm died of a myocardial infarction while asleep in a motel room in Taos, New Mexico, on November 18, 1999. He is buried in Sunset Memorial Park in San Antonio.\nA posthumous album, \"The Return of Wayne Douglas\", was released in 2000. Sahm's son, Shawn, leads his own Tex Mex band. They were on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1968, as father and son. Doug Sahm's other son, Shandon Sahm, is the drummer for the Meat Puppets as of 2010.\nSahm has been named into in the South Texas Music Walk of Fame. In 2008, he was inducted into the Austin Music Memorial, in the first group.\nHe also was given the Americana Music Association (AMA)'s Presidents Award in 2002.\nIn 2008, Austin, Texas approved the naming of Doug Sahm Hill, in a park near Lady Bird Lake, to honor him.\nIn October 2012, Steve Earle played a tribute to Sahm at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in Golden Gate Park.

This means it is a \"high quality\" trout water that has populations of wild trout. Also, these streams do not need stocking with hatchery trout.\nRecreation.\nThe main recreational activity on the upper part of the Kinnickinnic River is trout fishing. Nearer to River Falls downtown, walking, hiking, running, mountain biking along the trails are popular activities. The City is also a Bird City and attracts a number of birders along the river. Kayaking along the lower parts of the river has become popular."}

His political and cultural ambitions, based in Sicily and stretching through Italy to Germany, and even to Jerusalem, were enormous. However, his enemies, especially the popes, prevailed, and his dynasty collapsed soon after his death. Historians have searched for superlatives to describe him, as in the case of Professor Donald Detwiler, who wrote: \nViewing himself as a direct successor to the Roman Emperors of Antiquity, he was Emperor of the Romans from his papal coronation in 1220 until his death; he was also a claimant to the title of King of the Romans from 1212 and unopposed holder of that monarchy from 1215. As such, he was King of Germany, of Italy, and of Burgundy. At the age of three, he was crowned King of Sicily as a co-ruler with his mother, Constance of Hauteville, the daughter of Roger II of Sicily. His other royal title was King of Jerusalem by virtue of marriage and his connection with the Sixth Crusade.\nHe was frequently at war with the Papacy, hemmed in between Frederick's lands in northern Italy and his Kingdom of Sicily (the \"Regno\") to the south, and thus he was excommunicated four times and often vilified in pro-papal chronicles of the time and since. Pope Gregory IX went so far as to call him an Antichrist.\nSpeaking six languages (Latin, Sicilian, German, French, Greek and Arabic), Frederick was an avid patron of science and the arts. He played a major role in promoting literature through the Sicilian School of poetry. His Sicilian royal court in Palermo, from around 1220 to his death, saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo-Romance language, Sicilian. The poetry that emanated from the school had a significant influence on literature and on what was to become the modern Italian language. The school and its poetry were saluted by Dante and his peers and predate by at least a century the use of the Tuscan idiom as the elite literary language of Italy.\nHe was also the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered \"irrational\".\nAfter his death, his line quickly died out and the House of Hohenstaufen came to an end."}

Each shareholder owns company stock in proportion to the number of their shares (certificates of ownership). Some shareholders may own a larger proportion of a company's share than others. Shareholders are able to transfer their shares to others without any effects on the continued existence of the company.\nIncorporation, a legal process, gives a company a legal personality separate from shareholders, and limited liability. This means the shareholders are only liable for the company's debts to the value of the money they invested in the company. So, joint-stock companies are commonly known as corporations or limited companies.\nHistory.\nFinding the earliest joint-stock company is a matter of definition. Around 1250 in France at Toulouse, 96 shares of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Moulins du Bazacle\" (Bazacle Milling Company) were traded at a value that depended on the profitability of the Society's mills. This was probably the first company of its kind in history.\nThe much more famous, wealthy and powerful English (later British) East India Company was granted an English Royal Charter by Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600. The Royal Charter gave the newly created \"Honourable East India Company\" a 15-year monopoly on all trade in the East Indies. The Company transformed from a commercial trading venture to one which ruled India.\nIn 1602, the Dutch East India Company issued shares that were made tradable on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. This invention helped joint-stock companies to attract capital from investors as they could now easily trade their shares. In 1612 it became the first 'corporation' in intercontinental trade with 'locked in' capital and limited liability.\nClosely held \"vs\" publicly traded corporations.\nThe type of company most often referred to by the word \"corporation\" is a publicly traded corporation. In this type of company the shares are traded on a public stock exchange. For example, shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq in the United States. This is where shares of stock of corporations are bought and sold by and to the general public. Most of the largest businesses in the world are publicly traded corporations. However, the majority of corporations are said to be closely held, privately held or close corporations. This means that no ready market exists for the trading of shares. Many such corporations are owned and managed by a small group of businesspeople or companies. They can also be as vast as the largest public corporations.\nClosely held corporations have some advantages over publicly traded corporations. A small, closely held company can often make decisions much more rapidly than a publicly traded company, because there will generally be fewer voting shareholders or the shareholders would have common interests. A publicly traded company is also at the mercy of the market. It can have capital flow in and out based on what the company is doing and also what the competitors are doing. Publicly traded companies also have advantages over their closely held counterparts. Publicly traded companies often have more working capital. They can also delegate debt throughout all shareholders. This means shareholders of publicly traded company will each take a much smaller hit to their returns as opposed to those involved with a closely held corporation. Publicly traded companies though suffer from this exact advantage. A closely held corporation can often stand a hit to profit with little or no long-term effect. A publicly traded company though often comes under extreme scrutiny if profit and growth are not evident to stock holders. If profits go down stock holders may sell, further damaging the company. Often this blow is enough to make a small public company fail."}

Any girl who wants a child can call a Gabriel or some John.\" (3) \"Religion, capitalism, and government are all damned humbugs, liars, and thieves. Those three classes combine into one organization. (4) \"All religions are a deception of the people.\" (5) \"A young man came to Mary during the night, and, coming near her with a flower in his hand, took her by the hand and said: 'Sh; sh.' Look how the priests teach you, the falsifiers, thieves. It is not possible that he could be of the Holy Ghost, there must be a man. A young Jew was the father of the Christ. No woman can have a child without a man; that never happened and never can happen.\" (6) \"You see the Trinity (pointing to a picture of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which he had caused to be thrown upon a screen), God the Father, Ghost, and Son, a young Jew, but that old man never was and never can be; if he was God from the Ghost, then where did that belly button come from which is sprouted like a button? Bear in mind that the black army is a trinity, clergy, capitalism, and government; they govern the world together.\" (7) \"There is no truth in the Bible; it is only monkey business. Religion, capitalism, and government are a black army and only profiteer from the poor people. You see here (pointing to a picture of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which he had caused to be thrown upon a screen) scarecrows. Here is God the Father, Son, and Ghost, a whole Trinity, just as the priest, capitalists, and government. How can the Holy Ghost be God when she is afraid a cat will kill her? And do you believe in these scarecrows?\" (8) \"You see this fool (pointing to a picture of Jesus Christ upon the cross, with the private parts of his body covered with a cloth, which he had caused to be thrown upon a screen) and you believe in Him. The women were sorry for the holy thing and covered the holy thing, while the rest of the body was left uncovered.\"\nMockus was arrested under Maine's blasphemy law which reads: \"Blasphemy may be committed either by using profanely insolent and reproachful language against God, or by contumeliously reproaching Him, His creation, government, final judgment of the world, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Scriptures as contained in the canonical books of the Old and New Testament, or by exposing any of these enumerated Beings or Scriptures to contempt and ridicule, and it is not necessary for the state to prove the doing of all of them.\"\nMockus was found guilty by a jury trial in 1917 for his eight statements. His appeal went before the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine on March 25, 1921 as State v. Mockus and his conviction was upheld."}

In one of them, the eyes move rapidly. This is called REM-sleep (from rapid eye movement). Most dreams take place in this phase. REM-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night. The periods of REM-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night. REM-sleep was first discovered in 195253. The function of REM sleep is not well understood.\nNathaniel Kleitman and his student Eugene Aserinsky defined rapid eye movement and linked it to dreams in 1953. REM sleep was further described by researchers including William Dement and Michel Jouvet.\nThe other category, where this movement of the eyes does not happen, is called NREM-sleep (Non-REM sleep). Usually, dreams do not occur during this time. There are three or four stages of NREM-sleep. Stage I is just barely sleeping, or dozing. Stage II is also light sleep. Normally, in adult humans, about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep. Stages III and IV are called deep sleep. Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing. It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep. Sometimes stages III and IV are combined and called stage III.\nAdult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each. The night's sleep can be four or fine of these cycles. Each cycle includes, in this order: stage I, stage II, stage III (IV), stage II and REM.\nThe fact that birds and mammals both show REM and NREM sleep suggests that the trait evolved before the two groups diverged in their evolution. That suggests that the REM/NREM feature is both early and important in the evolution of land vertebrates.\nREM and dreams.\nRapid eye movement sleep is associated with dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common way to get dream reports. 80% of typical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances. Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing. They estimate the duration of their dreams as longer.\nLucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep. The mental events which occur during REM usually have dream 'hallmarks' including narrative structure, convincingness (like waking life), and instinctual themes.\nRapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder (more specifically a parasomnia) in which people act out their dreams.\nApart from its present distribution, nothing is known about the evolution of this brain feature, and its function is not exactly known. Experiments on humans suggests they need rem sleep or they get obvious mental deterioration."}

This amendment establishes a number of legal rights that apply to both civil and criminal proceedings. It contains several clauses: It guarantees the right to a grand jury. It forbids double jeopardy (being tried again for the same crime after an acquittal). It protects a person against self-incrimination (being a witness against himself). This is often called \"Pleading the Fifth\". The Fifth Amendment requires due process in any case where a citizen may be deprived of \"life, liberty, or property\". Any time the government takes private property for public use, the owner must be compensated. \nText.\nThe language of the Fifth Amendment is:\nClauses.\nGrand Juries.\nThe Fifth Amendment requires the use of grand juries by the federal legal system for all capital and \"infamous crimes\" (cases involving treason, certain felonies or gross moral turpitude). Grand juries trace their roots back to the Assize of Clarendon, an enactment by Henry II of England in 1166. The United States is one of the few remaining countries that uses the grand jury.\nDouble Jeopardy.\nThe Double Jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment forbids a defendant from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges in the same case following a legitimate acquittal or conviction. In common law countries, a defendant may enter a peremptory plea of \"autrefois acquit\" or \"autrefois convict\" (\"autrefois\" means \"in the past\" in French). It means if the defendant has been acquitted or convicted of the same offence and cannot be retried under the principle of double jeopardy. The original intent of the clause is to prevent an individual to go through a number of prosecutions for the same act until the prosecutor gets a conviction.\nSelf-Incrimination.\nIn a criminal prosecution, under the Fifth Amendment, a person has the right to refuse to incriminate himself (or herself). No person is required to give information that could be used against him. This is also called \"taking the Fifth\" or more commonly \"pleading the Fifth.\" The intent of this clause is to prevent the government from making a person confess under oath. A person may not refuse to answer any relevant question under oath unless the answer would incriminate him. If the answer to a question on the witness stand could be used to convict that person of a crime, he can assert his Fifth Amendment rights. \nThe authors of the Fifth Amendment intended the provisions in it apply only to the federal government. Since 1925, under the incorporation doctrine, most provisions of the Bill of Rights now also apply to the state and local governments. Since the landmark decision Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), when they arrest someone, police are required to include the \"right to remain silent\" as part of the legal Miranda warning (the wording may vary).\nDue process.\nThe due process clause guarantees every person a fair, just and orderly legal proceeding. The Fifth Amendment applies to the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, among other provisions, forbids states from denying anyone their life, their liberty or their property without due process of law So the Fourteenth Amendment expands the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment to apply to the states. Due process means the government must follow the law and not violate any parts of it. An example of violating due process is when a judge shows bias against the defendant in a trial. Another example is when the prosecution fails to disclose information to the defense that would show the defendant is not guilty of the crime. \nTakings.\nThe Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment states \"private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" The Fifth Amendment restricts only the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment extended this clause to include actions taken by State and local governments. Whenever the government wants to buy property for public use, they make an offer to the owner. If the owner does not want to sell the property, the government can take them to court and exercise a power called eminent domain. The name comes from the Latin term \"dominium eminens\" (meaning supreme lordship). The court then condemns the property (meaning say it can no longer be occupied by people). This allows the government to take over the property, but must pay \"just compensation\" to the owner. In other words, the government body must pay what the property is worth. \nA case heard before the U.S. Supreme Court, Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005), was decided in favor of allowing the use of eminent domain to transfer land from one private owner to another private owner. The court upheld the city of New London, Connecticut's proposed use of the petitioner's private property qualifies as a \"public use\" fell within the meaning of the Takings Clause. The city felt the property was in poor condition and the new owner would improve it. This extension of the Takings Clause has been very controversal."}

They are from\u00a0Seattle. Their members are\u00a0Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight. The group was created in 2012 before Mills and Knight graduated from Western Washington University. Their first album, \"Summer's Gone\", was released in 2012. There was a lot of excitement about this album in the underground electronic music community.\u00a0After\u00a0\"Summer's Gone, ODESZA released\"\u00a0their first EP, \"My Friends Never Die\", in 2013. They released their second LP, \"In Return\", in 2014. The duo released \"In Return (Deluxe Edition)\" on September 18, 2015 through Counter Records. This extended version of the original album had three new live recordings all featuring a horn section, instrumental music, and a new song \u201cLight (feat. Little Dragon)\u201d.\nHistory.\nHarrison Mills and Clayton Knight met each other during their first year at Western Washington University. The two did not study the same things. Knight studied physics and math while Mills studied graphic design. They did not begin creating music together until their senior year in 2012. As a child, Knight was taught how to play piano. \u00a0Later, he learned guitar. The duo quickly released their first Long Play, \"Summer's Gone\", on September 5 the same year. On November 9, 2012, ODESZA performed their first show. They performed first for Teen Daze and Beat Connection in Bellingham, WA. They soon hit 1 million Soundcloud plays. Their debut EP, \"My Friends Never Die\", was released a year later. ODESZA was booked to perform first for Pretty Lights on his tour called the Analog Future Tour in the fall of 2013. Their first big tour started on March 12, 2014. ODESZA had 30 million Soundcloud plays on October 1, 2014. On October 17, 2014, ODESZA's \"In Return\" North American tour sold out 28 shows. Twenty-four ODESZA tracks have hit #1 on the website\u00a0Hype Machine.

Upcoming festival appearances include Mad Decent Block Party, Sun City Music Festival, Backwoods Music Festival, Fun Fun Fun Fest, and Holy Ship!.\nName.\nOdesza is the Hungarian spelling for the city of Odessa, Ukraine. The band's name comes from the name from Mills' uncle's ship, which sank. Only his uncle and one other crew mate survived. Since the spelling \"Odessa\" was already being used by a Scottish synth band, they instead used the Hungarian spelling, replacing the \"ss\" with \"sz\".\nIndividually, Mills is known as Catacombkid. Knight is known as Beaches Beaches. When asked\u00a0how Mills got his nickname he says, \"I got into Aesop Rock and he has a song called 'Catacomb Kids.'

Galanes took her stage name \"Cecilia\" from the Simon and Garfunkel song of the same name. She was known for her singles: \"Un ramito de violetas\", \"Mi querida Espa\u00f1a\" and \"Dama, dama\". All of them were hit records during the 1970s.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nCecilia was born in El Pardo (Madrid's district and municipality) in 1948. Her father, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sobredo, was a military officer and diplomat. During her childhood she lived in other countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Portugal, Algeria and Jordan. She learned to speak English in addition to her native Spanish language. Her first few works were in English, but the rest were in Spanish. She studied music at a convent school in the United States. A nun taught her to play the guitar. When she returned to Spain she attended law school, but left her studies in order to work in the music industry.\nCareer.\nIn 1966 she began her career, but did not release her first album until 1970. It was titled \"Expresi\u00f3n\". The album included songs in English such as \"Try Catch the Sun\" and \"Have You Ever Had a Blue Day\". She released the albums \"Cecilia\" (1972), \"Cecilia 2\" (1973),\"Un ramito de violetas\" (1975) and \"Amor de medianoche\" (1975).\nCensorship.\nLike many other artists in Spain, Cecilia had to deal with the censorship of General Franco\u00b4s government. Some lyrics and photographs from the albums had to be changed or even removed before they were approved. Any mention of feminism or to the Spanish Civil War were controversial. The song \"Un mill\u00f3n de muertos\" (\"A million dead\") even after being changed to \"Un mill\u00f3n de sue\u00f1os\" (\"A million dreams\") was not approved to be played on the radio in Spain. \"Cecilia 2\" was the name that replaced \"Me quedar\u00e9 soltera\" (\"I will remain single\") as the album name due to the feminism behind that statement. The front cover of the record, originally showing a pregnant Cecilia, was promptly removed by the record company. The super-hit \"Mi querida Espa\u00f1a\" had some words deleted on the final version to minimize references to the Civil War and the end of the dictatorship. However, the original lyrics made it into print and came out in the inner side of the gatefold cover of the album.\nDeath.\nOn 2 August 1976, Cecilia was returning from a concert in Vigo, Galicia. She was in a car accident on the C-620 highway (currently N-525) near Colinas de Trasmonte. The accident happened at 05:40 (local time). She died at the scene after being hit by a cattle truck.\nCecilia was buried in La Almudena's cemetery in Madrid."}

The song was released in April 1970 as the third single from the group's fifth studio album, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" (1970). The song was written by Paul Simon. the song's origins lie in a late-night party. They got the rhythm when the duo and friends began slapping their thighs and drumming on a piano bench. They recorded the sound with a tape recorder, employing reverb and matching the rhythm created by the machine. Simon later wrote the song's guitar line and lyrics on the subject of an untrustworthy lover. Simon didn't remember what inspired him but he remembered Cecilia was the goddess of music.\nReception.\nThe song was a hit single in the United States, peaking at number four on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. On the \"Cash Box\" Top 100, it reached number one.\n\"Cecilia\" also did well in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, where it reached number two, and also in Switzerland and Belgium, where it peaked at number three. The song has been the subject of numerous cover versions, most notably by the singer Suggs, whose version featured the ragga duo, Louchie Lou &amp; Michie One and reached number four in the United Kingdom in 1996. In Malawi the song is banned. The president of the country thought the song was offensive to his official hostess, Cecilia Tamanda Kadzamira. \nLyrics.\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart&lt;br&gt;\nYou're shaking my confidence daily&lt;br&gt;\nOh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees&lt;br&gt;\nI'm begging you please to come home&lt;br&gt;\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart&lt;br&gt;\nYou're shaking my confidence daily&lt;br&gt;\nOh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees&lt;br&gt;\nI'm begging you please to come home&lt;br&gt;\nCome on home&lt;br&gt;\nMaking love in the afternoon with Cecilia&lt;br&gt;\nUp in my bedroom (making love)&lt;br&gt;\nI got up to wash my face&lt;br&gt;\nWhen I come back to bed someone's taken my place&lt;br&gt;\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart&lt;br&gt;\nYou're shaking my confidence daily&lt;br&gt;\nOh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees&lt;br&gt;\nI'm begging you please to come home&lt;br&gt;\nCome on home&lt;br&gt;\nBa-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba"}

He is best known for his unusual loyalty. He remained a faithful pet for many years after his owner died.\nLife.\nThe dog was born on a farm near the city of \u014cdate in Akita Prefecture.\nIn 1924, Hidesabur\u014d Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the University of Tokyo, took Hachik\u014d, a golden brown Akita as a pet. During his owner's life, Hachik\u014d greeted him at the end of each day at the nearby Shibuya Station. The two kept their daily routine until May 1925, when Professor Ueno did not come back to the train station. The professor had died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Each day for the next nine years, nine months and fifteen days, Hachik\u014d waited for Ueno's return. He showed up at the exact time the train was due at the station.\nOther travellers begin to notice Hachik\u014d still showing up. Many of the people had seen Hachik\u014d and Professor Ueno meet each afternoon. At first, people who worked at the station were not very friendly to the dog. But after a story was written about him in \"Asahi Shinbun\", people started to bring Hachik\u014d treats and food for him to eat while he waited.\nAkitas in Japan.\nIn 1932 one of Ueno's students Hirokichi Saito (who had learned much about the Akita breed) saw the dog at the station. He followed him to the home of the former gardener of Professor Ueno\u2014Kikuzaboro Kobayashi, where he learned the history of Hachik\u014d's life. Shortly after this meeting, the former student published a census of all the Akitas in Japan. His research found only 30 purebred Akitas still alive, including Hachik\u014d from Shibuya Station.\nJapanese culture.\nSaito went back many times to visit Hachik\u014d. Over the years he wrote several news stories about the dog's remarkable loyalty. In 1932 one of these stories, published in the Tokyo \"Asahi Shinbun\", made Hachik\u014d a national sensation.\nHis faithfulness to his master's memory meant a spirit of family loyalty for all Japanese people to achieve. Teachers and parents used Hachik\u014d's devotional watching for his master as an example for children to follow. A well-known Japanese artist made a sculpture of the dog, and in Japan a new awareness of the Akita breed grew.\nAt last, Hachik\u014d's legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty to the Emperor of Japan himself.\nDeath.\nHachik\u014d died on March 8, 1935, and was found on a street in Shibuya."}

It is energy that is stored in chemicals. One example of how this plays a part in real life is through plants. The plants make energy with chemical potential energy by the process of photosynthesis. Other organisms eat the plants to get energy and so on. Energy is passed from one organism to another. This is how chemical potential energy works in the environment. Another common example is the energy stored in gasoline. When the car is turned on, the chemical energy in the gas is converted into mechanical energy to move the car.

He asks to make a telephone call (after Gillian's aunt put a spell on his phone and broke it). Gillian learns Shep is about to marry an old college enemy of hers, Merle Kittridge. Gil and Pyewacket take revenge by casting a spell on Shep, so he has to fall in love with her. She eventually falls in love with him too. She must make a choice, because witches who fall in love lose their supernatural powers. When she decides to love Shep, Gillian's cat and animal spirit, Pyewacket, becomes angry and leaves.\nSidney Redlitch, the author of a best-selling book \"Magic in Mexico,\" suddenly appears in Shep's office (thanks to a little magic trick that just takes him there). Gilliam and Pyewacket have him arrive when she finds out Shep wants to meet with him about writing a book together. Redlitch is befuddled and confused but soon catches on. Redlitch is doing research for a book on witches in New York. He gats an \"inside\" helper when Gillian's warlock brother Nicky offers to help in exchange for a share of the profits.\nGillian later confesses to Shep that she is a witch and has bewitched him. Shep becomes angry, believing she cast a spell on him just to get even with Merle, and the two argue. Gillian tries to cast various spells on Merle, such as making her fall in love with the first man who walks into her apartment. She finds out, however, that she has lost her powers because she loves Shep.\nMeanwhile, Shep finds he really cannot leave Gillian, because of the spell. To escape, he turns to another witch, Bianca De Pass who breaks the spell with a horrible cooked brew that he must drink. Shep again fights with Gillian and leaves her heartbroken.\nShep is not able to get back together with Merle. She does not believe the witch story is true. Months later, Shep returns and finds out Gillian has lost her magic powers because of her love for him. Even Pyewacket has left her because she is not still magical. When he realizes her love is true, the two make up.\nSuccess.\n\"Bell Book and Candle\" was said to be a \"blockbuster\" by Columbia Pictures. Before it was released, the movie got heavy promotion.\nNovak appeared with Pyewacket, the cat, on the November 25 cover of \"Life magazine\" \"(LIFE)\", along with an article. There were also favorable write-ups in other major magazines.\nA production number on \"The Steve Allen Show\" (a televvision variety show) played the theme music.\nAwards.\n\"Bell, Book and Candle\" received Academy Award nominations in two categories: Best Art Direction for Cary Odell and Louis Diage; and Best Costume Design for Jean Louis.\nIt also received a Golden Globes nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.\nMusic.\nThe music heard in the movie was written by George Duning, a Columbia veteran composer. The music uses bongo drums and violins to bring out the magical mood of the plot. Heard during the opening credits, a few lines of \"Jingle Bells\" music are used to set the time of the story as Christmas.\nEach witch, including Pyewacket the cat, has an individual musical tune heard every time they are seen. Duning recorded sounds and replayed them at higher speeds to make the music sound spooky and odd. The soundtrack was released in January 1959."}

It was proposed by the American archaeologist Hallam L. Movius in 1948 to show a technological difference between the early prehistoric tool technologies of the east and the west of the Old World.\nMovius noticed that the palaeolithic stone tools from sites east of northern India never contained handaxes. They had less formal implements known as chopping tools. These were sometimes as extensively worked as the Acheulean tools from further west, but could not be described as true handaxes. Movius then drew a line on a map of India to show where the difference occurred, dividing the tools of Africa, Europe and Western and Southern Asia from those of Eastern and South-eastern Asia.\nFossil evidence also suggests a difference in the evolutionary development of the people who made the two different tool types across the Movius Line. The line is still in use as a distinction between the two traditions. The existence of the line, in terms of stone tool technology and human evolution, is still not explained."}

Basically in its simplest use it can mean just children's rights, like for example talking about child labor problems. But when this phrase is used in the middle of an argument, it can be used to try to make people feel emotional when thinking about the needs of children, and then to try and fool people into doing what they want because they might be scared that they do not want to harm children.\nThe 2002 book \"Art, Argument, and Advocacy\" (2002) said that using this phrase replaced emotion instead of reason in the middle of an argument with someone. Ethicist Jack Marshall wrote in 2005 that the phrase is so popular because it can stop people from behaving rationally especially when they are talking about morals. \"Think of the children\" was used by censorship supporters to try to defend children from things they thought were dangerous to these young people. The book \"Community, Space and Online Censorship\" (2009) wrote that calling children just babies in need of protection was a form of focusing too much on the concept of purity. A 2011 article in the \"Journal for Cultural Research\" wrote that \"Think of the children\" was caused by people thinking too hard about telling everyone what to do and the difference between right-and-wrong.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Think of the children\" as a phrase was used in the 1964 Walt Disney Pictures film \"Mary Poppins\"; where Mrs. Banks pleaded with her departing nanny not to quit and to asked her to \"Think of the children!\". Its use was popularized through satire on the television program \"The Simpsons\", beginning in 1996. Character Helen Lovejoy pleaded: \"Won't somebody please think of the children!\" during loud arguments in the town of Springfield on the TV show.\nLaw professor Charles J. Ten Brink in the 2012 \"Georgia State University Law Review\" wrote that \"The Simpsons\" character Helen Lovejoy's use of \"Think of the children\" was a good form of parody. The phrase's use was made fun of a lot when people used it in politics. After it became popular on \"The Simpsons\", use of the phrase was called \"Lovejoy's Law\", the \"Helen Lovejoy defence\", the \"Helen Lovejoy Syndrome\", and \"think-of-the-children-ism\"."}

Little is known about the origin of the music known as the blues. No year can be cited as the origin, because the style evolved over a long period. Ethnomusicologist Gerhard Kubik traces the roots of many of its elements back to the African continent, the \"cradle of the blues\".\nOne early mention comes from 1901, when an archaeologist in Mississippi described the songs of black workers which had lyrical themes and technical elements in common with the blues.\nThere are few characteristics common to all blues. The genre takes its shape from the peculiarities of each individual performance. Some characteristics are common to most styles of African American music. The earliest blues-like music was a \"functional expression, rendered in a call-and-response style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure\". This pre-blues music was adapted from the field shouts and hollers performed during slave times, expanded into \"simple solo songs laden with emotional content\".\nMany of these blues elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the music of Africa. When African slaves went to work in North America, they took musical traditions with them. Early forms of music include spirituals and work songs. Spirituals were religious songs and work songs were sung to the rhythm of working. Work songs included a vocal call and response, or where the lead drummer makes a beat and then the others respond to it.\nThe majority of blues songs have four beats in a bar, and are built on the 12 bar blues form which uses three phrases, each four bars long. They can also use the blue scale."}

Both mean that a participant in a competition is not required to compete while most of the other participants are. Its main use is in tournament competitions. In single-elimination tournaments, when there are an odd number of participants, a bye allows one or more to play in a later round. Other types of eliminator tournaments may also include a bye for others reasons. An example would be as a reward for the best ranked team(s).\nIn round-robin tournaments where there are an odd number of competitors, usually one gets a bye in each round. However, over the whole tournament, each team plays the same number of games.\nSimilar to the round-robin context, in leagues where most teams play on the same days during regular-season play, a team that does not play on a given day is said to be on bye. In sports that are played weekly, especially gridiron football, a team that does not play at all during a given week is said to be on its bye week. For example, during the regular football Season in the NFL, each team gets a week off (bye week) during the regular season."}

Their rule lasted for 275 years, from 305 BC to 30 BC. They were the last dynasty of ancient Egypt.\nPtolemy, was one of Alexander the Great's generals and deputies. He was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander's death in 323 BC. In 305\u00a0BC, he declared himself King Ptolemy I, later known as \"Soter\" (savior). The Egyptians soon accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt. Unlike their previous rulers under the Achaemenid Empire, they usually lived in Egypt. Ptolemy's family ruled Egypt until the Roman conquest of 30 BC.\nAll the male rulers of the dynasty took the name Ptolemy. Ptolemaic queens, some of whom were the sisters of their husbands, were usually called Cleopatra, Arsinoe or Berenice. The most famous, was the last queen, Cleopatra VII. She was involved in the Roman political battles between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and later between Octavian and Mark Antony. Her death marked the end of Ptolemaic rule in Egypt.\nPtolemaic rulers and consorts.\nDates in brackets represent the ruling dates of the Ptolemaic pharaohs. They often ruled jointly with their wives, who were often also their sisters. Several queens exercised royal authority, but the most famous and successful was Cleopatra VII (51\u201330 BC), with her two brothers and her son as successive nominal co-rulers. Several systems exist for numbering the later rulers; the one used here is the one most widely used by modern scholars.\nMedical analysis.\nMembers of the Ptolemaic dynasty were described as extremely obese. Their sculptures and coins show prominent eyes and swollen necks. Graves' disease within the family could explain the swollen necks and eye prominence (exophthalmos), although this is unlikely if they were simply obese.\nMembers of this dynasty likely suffered from a multi-organ fibrotic condition such as Erdheim\u2013Chester disease or a familial multifocal fibrosclerosis. With this condition, then thyroiditis, obesity and ocular proptosis can all occur at the same time."}

The crown was white and after Lower and Upper Egypt joined together, it was combined with the Deshret, the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. This Double Crown was called the Pschent. The symbol sometimes used for the Hedjet was the vulture goddess Nekhbet. This would be shown next to the head of the cobra goddess Wadjet, the Uraeus on the Pschent.\nHistory.\nThe white crown has a long history, going back into the Predynastic Period. This shows that kingship had been the base of Egyptian society for some time. The earliest image of the Hedjet was thought to have been in the Qustul in Nubia. New discoveries, particularly the excavation of Cemetery U and the tome U-j, dating to Naqada IIIA have shown that it appears earlier in Egypt.\nNekhbet, the protective goddess of Nekhebet (modern el Kab) near Hierakonpolis, was shown as a woman, sometimes with the head of a vulture, wearing the White Crown. The falcon god Horus of Hierakonpolis (Egyptian: Nekhen) was generally shown wearing a White Crown. The White Crown is on the Narmer Palette found at Hierakonpolis. It shows the king of the South wearing the \"hedjet\", triumphing over his northern enemies. The kings of the united Egypt saw themselves as successors of Horus. Vases from the reign of Khasekhemwy show the king as Horus wearing the White Crown.\nAs with the Deshret (Red Crown), no example of the White Crown has survived. It is unknown how it was made or what materials were used. It is possible it was made from felt or leather. The fact that no crown has ever been found, might suggest that the crown was passed from one ruler to the next, much as in present day monarchies."}

He was born in the city of Limerick, Ireland. He went to school in D\u00fan Laoghaire (then called Kingstown) in County Dublin. Deane studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, graduating in 1909. He played rugby for Ireland in one match, against England in February 1909. However, his rugby career was cut short after he broke his leg soon after in a game against Oxford University.\nDeane became a surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital, Dublin. He was then commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1911. In 1913, he was posted to India and served in Burma. He was sent to Meerut at the start of the First World War. He went to France with the Garhwal Brigade of the Indian Expeditionary Force. They d in Marseilles in September 1914. He was then sent immediately to the Western Front. There he served first with the 20th Field Ambulance. Then he served as a medical officer of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Leicestershire Regiment. His unit saw much active service. On 22 August 1915, he was awarded the Military Cross after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four men who had been wounded by artillery fire. A month later, his regiment participated in the Battle of Loos, and was almost entirely destroyed. He was shot dead after going to help some injured soldiers. His action earned him a mention in dispatches."}

It started in the 1940s. Doo-wop achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&amp;B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (1914\u20131978) is often called the \"Godfather of Doo-wop\". He introduced the \"top and bottom\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics.\nThe first record to use the syllables \"doo-wop\" was the 1955 hit \"When You Dance\" by the Turbans. The term \"doo-wop\" first appeared in print in 1961. During the late 1950s many Italian-American groups added to the doo-wop scene. The peak of doo-wop was in 1961. Doo-wop's influence continued in soul, pop, and rock groups of the 1960s. At various times in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the genre has seen revivals. Doo-wop was a precursor to many of the afro-American musical styles seen today. An evolution of jazz and blues, doo-wop also influenced many of the major Rock and Roll groups that defined the later decades of the 20th century. Doo-wop is iconic for it\u2019s swing-like beats and using the off-beat to keep time. Doo-wop laid the foundation for many musical innovations, for example, R&amp;B.\nIt has had a revival recently as Meghan Trainor usually makes songs with in the genre."}

The practice has been different in different countries, and at different times.\nMost primary schools have been co-educational for a long time. There is no reason to educate females separately before the age of puberty. Also, the curriculum in primary schools is not controversial. It emphasize reading, writing and arithmetic, with some elementary knowledge of geography and history. In some countries it includes some religious as well as cultural education.\nHowever, before the mid-19th century, girls were often educated at home, or were not educated at all. On this point, there were great differences in different parts of the world. In England and Wales, universal primary education was set up by the Elementary Education Act of 1870, and attendance from the ages of 5 to 10 was compulsory. This was extended in another Act of 1880. Since then. almost all primary education in the United Kingdom has been co-educational, and so it is in many other countries.\nWith secondary education, children go through the process of puberty, and there is no general agreement as to whether the two genders should be educated together. There are arguments for and against. At one extreme is the United States, where both sexes are educated together at all stages. At the other extreme are certain traditional societies where girls do not get a secondary education at all. The tendency has been for more countries to move to co-education as the standard at every level of education."}

He is known for writing the universal history \"Bibliotheca historica\", much of which survives, between 60 and 30 BC. It is arranged in three parts. The first part covers mythic history up to the destruction of Troy. It is arranged geographically, describing regions around the world including Egypt, India, Arabia, Greece and Europe. The second part covers the Trojan War to the death of Alexander the Great. The third part covers the period to about 60 BC. The title Bibliotheca, meaning 'library', shows that he was using the work of many other authors.\nLife.\nDiodorus wrote that he was born at Agyrium in Sicily (now called Agira). There is only two other references to Diodorus. One is by Jerome, in his \"Chronicon\" from 49 BC, who wrote that \"Diodorus of Sicily, a writer of Greek history, became illustrious\". There is also a Greek inscription in the collection of the Agyrium (Inscriptiones Graecae XIV, 588) about the tombstone of one \"Diodorus, the son of Apollonius\". (This may be a different person).\nWork.\nDiodorus' book, which he called \"Bibliotheca historica\" meaning \"Historical Library\", consisted of 40 books. Books 1\u20135 and 11\u201320 survive. Small sections of the lost books are preserved in Photius and the excerpts of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.\nIt was divided into three sections. The first six books treated the mythic history of the non-Hellenic and Hellenic tribes to the destruction of Troy and are geographical in theme, and describe the history and culture of Ancient Egypt (book I), of Mesopotamia, India, Scythia, and Arabia (II), of North Africa (III), and of Greece and Europe (IV\u2013VI).\nIn the next section (books VII\u2013XVII), he tells the history of the world from the Trojan War down to the death of Alexander the Great. The last section (books XVII to the end) concerns the historical events from the successors of Alexander down to either 60 BC or the beginning of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars. As the last books have been lost, it is not known if Diodorus reached the beginning of the Gallic War as he promised at the beginning of his work or, as evidence suggests, old and tired from his labours he stopped at 60 BC.) He used the name \"Bibliotheca\" to show that he was writing a work from many sources. Identified authors on whose works he drew include Hecataeus of Abdera, Ctesias of Cnidus, Ephorus, Theopompus, Hieronymus of Cardia, Duris of Samos, Diyllus, Philistus, Timaeus, Polybius, and Posidonius.\nHis writing of gold mining in Nubia in eastern Egypt is one of the earliest texts on the topic, and describes in vivid detail the use of slave labour in terrible working conditions.\nHe also described the Celts:\n\"Physically the Celts are terrifying in appearance with deep-sounding and very harsh voices. In conversation they use few words and speak in riddles, for the most part hinting at things and leaving a great deal to be understood. They frequently exaggerate with the aim of extolling themselves and diminishing the status of others. They are boasters and threateners, and given to bombastic self-dramatization, and yet they are quick of mind and with good natural ability for learning.\" (Book 5)"}

It was marked by the reign of Amenhotep IV, who changed his name to Akhenaten (1353\u20131336 BC). This was to underline the dramatic change of Egypt's polytheistic religion into one where the sun disc Aten was worshipped over all other gods. Aten was not solely worshipped (the religion was not monotheistic), but other gods were worshipped to a significantly lesser degree. The Egyptian pantheon of the equality of all gods and goddesses was restored under Akhenaten's successor.\nDuring Akhenaten's reign, royal portraiture changed. Sculptures of Akhenaten are different from those of earlier pharaohs. Akhenaten is shown in an androgynous (less manly) and stylized manner, with large thighs, a slim torso, drooping belly, full lips, and a long neck and nose. Some believe that the break with convention was due to \"the presence at Amarna of new people or groups of artists whose background and training were different from those of the Karnak sculptors\".\nThe events following Akhenaten's death are unclear and the identity and policies of his co-regent and immediate successor Smenkhkare are unclear.\nTutankhamun and the Amarna succession.\nTutankhamun died before he was twenty years old, and the dynasty's final years clearly were shaky. The royal line of the dynasty died out with Tutankhamun. Two fetuses found buried in his tomb may have been his twin daughters who would have continued the royal lineage, according to a 2008 investigation.\nThe last two members of the eighteenth dynasty \u2013 Ay and Horemheb \u2013 became rulers from the ranks of officials in the royal court. Ay may have married the widow of Tutankhamun in order to get power and she did not live long afterward. Ay's reign was short. His successor was Horemheb, a general in the Egyptian army, who had been a diplomat in the administration of Tutankhamun. He may have been named as a successor by the childless Tutankhamun. Horemheb may have taken the throne away from Ay in a coup. He also died childless and appointed his successor, Paramessu who, under the name Ramesses I, ascended the throne in 1292 BC. He was the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth dynasty."}

He published fiction, non-fiction, biographies, a commentary on war, and a history of the early days of movies. In 1904, in an essay about him, \"Book News Biographies\" said \"for the past ten years Mr. Van Zile has been known to the reading public through many short stories, novelettes and a few novels\".\nBiography.\nHe was born on May 2, 1863 in Troy, New York to Oscar Edward Van Zile and Sarah Melinda Perry. He was a descendant of Hollanders who came to America in the 17th century. As a boy he read everything he could on every subject. He graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut in 1884. In 1904 the college gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters. In addition to several books and articles, he wrote a libretto for a musical comedy.\nIn 1887 he married Mary Bulkeley. They had a daughter, Winifred Van Zile (1902-1902). He died on May 29, 1931 of a stroke at his home at 439 East Fifty-first Street in Manhattan, New York City. He was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.\nA timely invention.\nBy 1876, baseball scores were telegraphed, inning by inning, to newspaper offices. Fans who did not want to wait for the newspaper coverage of away games waited at newspaper offices. Some newspapers put up blackboards trying to show the progress of a game as they received the telegraphs.\nIn 1888, Van Zile was working as an editorial writer at the New York World. He found himself doodling an idea on a notepad. He was, subconsciously he later said, working out a diagram of a baseball diamond. On it he showed pegs indicating the positions of players and other information. Edwin Grozier, at the time Private Secretary to Joseph Pulitzer, looking over his shoulder said \"Van Zile, you get that idea patented, and I'll give you $250 for your interest in it.\" He had come up with what he called a \"Bulletin Board and Base Ball Indicator.\" He filed for a patent in 1888 and it was issued in 1889. It was a major breakthrough in showing the progress of baseball games. The World newspaper placed a large version of it outside their offices for that year\u2019s baseball championship series. It was a tremendous hit. Crowds of up to 6,000 watched to get a play-by-play view of the games."}

However, at least the first three kings were buried at Saqqara. This could mean the center of power had moved to Memphis. Beyond this, little can be said about the events during this period. The annual records on the Palermo Stone only survive for the end of the reign of Nebra and for parts of Nynetjer's. One important event possibly happened during the reign of Khasekhemwy: many Egyptologists read his name (\"the Two Powers arise\") as commemorating the union of the Upper and Lower Egypts."}

He was United States Postmaster General from 1921\u201322. He is best known for the Hays Code for censorship of American movies. He was born in Sullivan, Indiana.\nHe was the manager of Warren G. Harding's successful campaign for the Presidency of the United States in 1920. He was then named Postmaster General. While serving in the Harding Administration, he became somewhat involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. This was because of some illegal donations.\nCareer change.\nHays gave up his cabinet position on January 14, 1922. He become President of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), when it first began. This group now handles the well-known voluntary film rating system. He began his new job, at a $35,360 () annual salary, on March 6 of that year. There was talk that he would be paid between $100,000 and $150,000 a year.\nScandal and outcry.\nThe goal of the group was to rescue the image of the movie industry because of a scandal at that time. An actress, Virginia Rappe, had been raped and murdered. A well-known movie star, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle was accused. Religious groups were angry and demanded federal censorship of the movies. Hiring Hays to \"clean up the moving pictures\" was a public relations tactic. Much was said about his conservative ways. These included his being a Presbyterian deacon and the past chairman of the Republican Party.\nIn his new role in Hollywood, Hays' main task was to stop American state censor boards from banning movies that were too dirty to be shown. He also had to keep costs down for the movie studios for changes made to give a movie an acceptable rating. At that time, the movie studios were required by state laws to pay the censor boards for each foot of movie that was cut out. Studios also had the expense of making different versions of each censored movie for each state's different ruling.\nHays tried to reduce studio costs by telling studios how to make movies that would be safe enough not to have to be cut or changed. Each board kept its \"standards\" secret. Hays had to try to guess what would or would not be allowed by each board. He made a set of guidelines he called \"The Don'ts and Be Carefuls\". In general he was not successful in quieting demands for federal censorship.\nHays Code.\nCatholic bishops and non-church people were suspicious of federal censorship. They preferred the Hays approach of self-censorship. For several months in 1929, a group of Catholic leaders tried to come up with a new stricter code of behavior for the movies. A church Father wrote the legal code. This later became known as \"The Hays Code\". It was shown to Will Hays in 1930. He said, \"My eyes nearly popped out when I read it. This was the very thing I had been looking for\".\nFrom 1930 to 1934, the Production Code was only somewhat helpful in fighting off calls for federal censorship. Things came to a head in 1934, with widespread threats of Catholic boycotts of immoral movies. The studios gave the MPAA full authority to enforce the Production Code on all studios. These strict rules of self-censorship lasted for decades. (The Code was finally set aside in the 1960s when the MPAA adopted the age-based rating system now in force.)\nAlso in 1934, Hays made a list of 117 names of actors and actresses whose personal lives he thought made them unfit to appear in movies.\nMany European nations had quotas to make more of their own movies instead of Hollywood imports. A big success of Hays was his ability to work with the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Commerce, to keep Hollywood on top of overseas movie markets.\nDeath.\nAfter his retirement, Will H. Hays returned to Sullivan, Indiana, where he died on March 7, 1954. His widow died in 1960."}

{"id": "517640", "revid": "135008", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517640", "title": "Hotepsekhemwy", "text": "Hotepsekhemwy was an early Egyptian king, the first ruler of the Second Dynasty. It is not known how long he ruled. The Turin King List has him ruling for 95 years. The Ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reports that the reign of \"Bo\u00ebth\u00f4s\" lasted for 38 years. Egyptologists now believe Hotepsekhemwy ruled for either 25 or 29 years.\nName sources.\nHotepsekhemwy's name has been found at Saqqara, Giza, Badari and Abydos, on clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention Hotepsekhemwy along with the name of his successor Raneb.\nThe Horus name of Hotepsekhemwy may give clues to the politics of the time. The Egyptian word \"Hotep\" means \"peaceful\", \"to be pleased\", and also \"conciliation\" or \"to be reconciled\". So Hotepsekhemwy's full name may be read as \"the two powers are reconciled\" or \"pleasing in powers\". This suggests a significant political meaning. \"The two powers\" could be Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt as well as to the major deities Horus and Seth.\nFrom the reign of Hotepsekhemwy onward it became a tradition to write the Horus name and the nebty name in the same way. The Horus name has a clearly defined, symbolic meaning in its translation. Horus- and nebty names being the same might also show, that the Horus name was used when becoming king.\nFamily.\nThe name of Hotepsekhemwy's wife is unknown. There could be a son, Perneb, who had the titles \u201cson of the king\u201d and \u201cpriest of Sopdu\u201d. The clay seals with Perneb's name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which belonged to two kings equally, Hotepsekhemwy and his successor, Raneb. It is not possible to know which was his father.\nIdentity.\nHotepsekhemwy is known from lists made at the time of Ramesses II. The name \"Bedjau\" is found on the Abydos king list, \"Bedjatau\" from Giza, \"Netjer-Bau\" from the Sakkara king list and the name \"Bau-hetepju\" is on the Turin King List. A similar name, \"Bedjatau\", is on a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. \"Bedjatau\" means \"the foundryman\". This is thought to be a misreading of the name \"Hotepsekhemwy\". The hieroglyphic signs used to write \"Hotep\" are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in hieratic writings. The signs of two \"Sekhem\"sceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. This kind of misreading may have happened in the case of King Khasekhemwy, where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg-symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list copies this Old Kingdom name form of \u201cBedjatau\u201d. The names \"Netjerbau\" and \"Bau-hetepju\" are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them.\nReign.\nLittle is known about Hotepsekhemwy's reign. Evidence shows he may have gained the throne after a period of political strife. During this time there were several kings who only ruled for a very short time, such as Horus \"Bird\" and Sneferka. Sneferka could be a name used by king Qaa for a short time. The tomb of king Qaa was robbed at the end of First dynasty, and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. The robbing of the cemetery and the conciliatory meaning of the name Hotepsekhemwy may be clues of a dynastic struggle. The kings Sneferka and Horus \u201cBird\u201d were left out of later king lists, perhaps because their struggles for the Egyptian throne led to the collapse of the first dynasty.\nA new royal residence called \"Horus the shining star\" built for Hotepsekhemwy. He also built a temple near Buto for the god \"Netjer-Achty\" and founded the \"Chapel of the White Crown\". The white crown, the hedjet, is a symbol of Upper Egypt. This is a clue to the origin of Hotepsekhemwy's dynasty, and shows a likely source of political power. There is no mention of a Sed festival,which shows that Hotepsekhemwy cannot have ruled longer than 30 years. The Sed festival was celebrated as the anniversary for a reign of 30 years.\nThe ancient Egyptian historian Manetho reported that during his reign, \"a chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished\". Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC \u2013 over two thousand years later \u2013 the story may be based on fact, as the region near Bubastis is known to be seismically active.\nTomb.\nThe location of Hotepsekhemwy's tomb is unknown. Some Egyptologists believe it could be the giant underground \"Gallery Tomb B\" beneath the funeral passage of the Unas-necropolis at Saqqara. Many seal impressions of king Hotepsekhemwy have been found in these galleries. Others think that \"Gallery Tomb B\" is the burial site of king Raneb. Several seal impressions of this ruler were also found there."}

Strictly speaking, the name \"Bullet cluster\" refers to the smaller subcluster, moving away from the larger one. It is at a co-moving radial distance of 1.141 x 109 parsecs (3.7 billion light-years).\nGravitational lensing studies of the Bullet cluster are claimed to provide the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter. However, this interpretation of the gravitational lensing results is disputed. Observations of other galaxy cluster collisions, such as MACS J0025.4-1222, are similarly claimed to support the existence of dark matter.\nMordehai Milgrom, the original proposer of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), has posted on-line a rebuttal of claims that the Bullet Cluster proves the existence of dark matter. Milgrom claims that MOND correctly accounts for the dynamics of galaxies outside of galaxy clusters, and even in clusters such as the Bullet Cluster it removes the need for most dark matter, leaving only a factor of two which Milgrom expects to be simply unseen ordinary matter (non-luminous baryonic matter) rather than cold dark matter. Without MOND, or some similar theory, the matter discrepancy in galaxy clusters is a factor of 10, i.e. MOND reduces this discrepancy five-fold to a factor of 2."}

The whole area is part of the necropolis, a very big, underground cemetery used during the Second Temple period in Jerusalem. There are a few reasons why this area in Jerusalem has so many burial caves. First, the area was used for stone quarrying - taking huge pieces of stone out of the ground to use them to build things. This left large caves. Also, at the time, rich people in Jerusalem liked the idea of burial caves. This made the idea of a necropolis easier and popular. "}

It was special because it included Jim Henson's Muppets. Before he worked on \"Sesame Street\", Henson had made his puppet characters for a more adult audience, including his show \"Sam and Friends\". His characters were regular appearances on the late-night-comedy television shows including \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". After \"Sesame Street\", Henson was afraid that he would only be able to get work in the future on children's television series. His friend and advisor Bernie Brillstein, who also represented Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi, helped him move over from his prior work to \"Saturday Night Live\". \nThe idea behind \"The Land of Gorch\" was that it had Muppet characters in a far-away place, who were members of a royal family. They behaved rudely, with many references to drug abuse, sex, and drinking alcohol. Characters included King Ploobis and Queen Peutra and children, and servants Scred and Vazh. These characters often spoke to their wise prophet Mighty Favog for advice.\nThe staff of \"Saturday Night Live\" disagreed with Henson's ideas. Writers Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches involving \"The Land of Gorch\". Henson felt they were trying to write for situational comedy and were not keeping true to his own ideas. Frank Oz agreed in the end that the match was not perfect between \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Land of Gorch\", and was thankful that by the end of the year he and Henson were able to move on to \"The Muppet Show\".\nInfluence and reviews.\n\"The Land of Gorch\" influenced many later creations by Jim Henson. His feature film \"The Dark Crystal\" used both puppetry techniques and story ideas from the sketches. The Jim Henson Company television show \"Dinosaurs\" later contained similar story ideas previously seen in \"The Land of Gorch\", including a plot-line about environmentalism. \nCommentators talking about \"The Land of Gorch\" agreed that the reception was bad \u2014 \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that it became an open joke between the staff that no one wanted to continue having the sketches on \"Saturday Night Live\". \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called the characters the opposite of Kermit the Frog, and compared them to trolls. \"DVD Talk\" called the feature the worst mistake made in the first season of the \"Saturday Night Live\". \"Vogue\" described the characters as early versions of Muppets and the world they inhabited as quite dark. Academic Michael J. Bernsten wrote in his essay \"The Muppetry of Nightmares\" that the idea failed because the characters were not funny and did not have strong values."}

In the UK they are called 'plant growth substances'. The best known plant hormone is auxin.\nPlant hormones are signal molecules produced within the plant. They occur in extremely low concentrations. Hormones regulate cellular processes in targeted cells. Hormones also govern the formation of flowers, stems, leaves, the shedding of leaves, and the development and ripening of fruit.\nPlants, unlike animals, lack glands that produce and secrete hormones. Individual cells can produce hormones. They affect which tissues grow upward and which grow downward, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, plant longevity, and even plant death. Hormones are vital to plant growth, and, lacking them, plants would be mostly a mass of undifferentiated cells. So they are also known as growth factors or growth hormones.\nPhytohormones are found not only in higher plants, but in algae too, with similar functions. They also occur in fungi and bacteria, where they may be used to induce beneficial reactions in host plants."}

It is a broad term covering the many different forms music can be released in. Music can be released as singles, extended plays or as albums. A popular medium for releases is the Compact Disc (CD).\nMusical performers often self-release (self-publish) their recordings without the involvement of an established record label. Some artists or groups who enjoy local or small scale popularity have started their own labels in order to release their music. Others simply sell the music directly to customers. One example is when it is sold at their live concerts. With the growth of the Internet, many musical acts have sold their recordings over the Internet without a record label. Unlike self-publishing a novel, which usually means that publishers did not want to publish it, even well-known musicians will choose to self-release recordings. Music managers are increasingly getting involved in music releases.\nThe word can also mean the event at which an album or single is first offered for sale. A release is sometimes called an album launch, or single launch. "}

Typefaces have names, such as \"Times New Roman\", \"Garamond\", \"Baskerville\".\nEvery font of a typeface has specific details (such as size and weight) and is used in a particular way. The reason for having different fonts is to give the designer or printer choices which suit various needs. The most basic of all needs is to have the text legible and readable.\nThere are many versions of typefaces which are out of copyright. \"ITC Garamond\" is a different typeface from \"Adobe Garamond\" or \"Monotype Garamond\". These are all versions of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.\nThere are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly.\nThe art and craft of designing typefaces is called \"type design\". In digital typography, type designers are sometimes also called \"font developers\" or \"font designers\".\nEvery typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as map-making or astrology and mathematics.\nA very widely used typeface is \"Times New Roman\". This is a serif typeface commissioned by the British newspaper \"The Times\" in 1931. This typeface was later adapted for use in book printing, and again for use as a computer face.

They were thrown in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber.

If reasonable doubt remains, the accused is to be ted. Under Justinian Codes and English Common law, the accused is presumed innocent in criminal proceedings.

All three songs, in order of their former popularity, re-entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, after Houston's death, debuting the same week at numbers 7, 35 and 41, respectively, giving Houston three posthumous chart hits.\nWhitney Houston version.\nClive Davis, founder of Houston's label Arista Records, was initially against Houston recording the song for her debut studio album, \"Whitney Houston\", but he eventually gave in after persuasion from Houston and Masser. It was released as the B-side to the single \"You Give Good Love\", a previous Top 5 hit by Houston. The song was eventually released as a single in its own right. The song, released on March 18, 1986, was the seventh release from Houston's debut album, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in May of that year.\nHouston's album version features a piano intro, while the single version begins with a keyboard intro. After the single became a success, it replaced the original album version on subsequent pressings of the album. However, the original version was restored for the 2010 Deluxe Anniversary Edition reissue of the album."}

A defendant is not required to prove his or her innocence. The standard the prosecution must reach is proof of their version of the facts beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil trial the burden of proof is on the one bringing the case to court, called the plaintiff. In a civil trial the burden of proof is on the plaintiff. The standard that must be met is that the \"preponderance of the evidence\" (weight of the evidence) is enough to prove their case. \nAffirmative defense.\nIf a defendant in a civil or criminal case wants to provide an alternative set of facts to those provided by the prosecution or the plaintiff, this is called an \"affirmative defense\". This shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to prove his or her version of the facts. The defendant would seek to excuse or justify his or her actions that brought the lawsuit. Common affirmative defenses include entrapment, Self-defense, unclean hands, insanity, and the statute of limitations.\nPreponderance of the evidence.\nPreponderance of the evidence, also known as the \"balance of probabilities\" is the standard required in most civil cases. It is also used in family court for determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act.\nThe standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. The standard is satisfied if there is greater than fifty percent chance that the proposition is true. Lord Denning, in \"Miller v. Minister of Pensions\", described it simply as \"more probable than not.\" Until 1970, this was also the standard used in juvenile court in the United States. This is a far lower burden than \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the threshold a prosecutor must meet in criminal trials.\nBeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThis is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in common law countries. It usually only applies in criminal proceedings. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence (or lack of evidence) in a case, then the level of proof has not been met. If the jury, or judge in a bench trial, has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant is guilty."}

Section 10 says: 'No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law. . .'\nIn civil law.\n\"Ex post facto\" laws relate only to criminal laws passed by legislations.

Alaska's Megan's Law was applied to sex offenders before the law went into effect. It required offenders to register with the local police. It also required public notification via the Internet.

This event is called the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Cort\u00e9s helped old enemies of the Aztecs defeat them in one of the most important events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas.\nThe Spanish conquest was devastating to the Aztec people. By 1680, 94% of the Aztec population had died. \nEnd of the Empire.\nIn 1515, two of the states in the Aztec Empire rebelled. This was nothing new for the Aztecs. However, this time, the Tlaxcala and Huexotzingo rebels beat the Aztec military.\nThen, in April 1519, Spanish conquistadors, led by Cort\u00e9s, arrived on the coast of Mexico. In August they marched to Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. At first, Montezuma II, the Aztecs' ruler, invited the Spanish into Tenochtitlan, and things were friendly. Even when the Spanish made Montezuma II a prisoner, the Aztecs stayed friendly.\nHowever, soon, while Cort\u00e9s was away, Spanish soldiers attacked and killed many Aztecs during a festival. When Cort\u00e9s got back, he got Montezuma II to tell the Aztecs to stop fighting the conquistadors. By this time, though, the Aztecs had made Montezuma II's brother, Cuauthemoc, the king. Nobody did what Montezuma II said. They kept fighting the conquistadors, and they killed two out of every three Spanish soldiers. In July 1520 the Spanish survivors fled to Tlaxcala, where enemies of the Aztecs protected them.\nTen months later, Cort\u00e9s came back to Tenochtitlan with more Spanish soldiers but mostly Tlaxcaltecas and other indigenous enemies of the Aztecs. They started a siege of Tenochtitlan, so that no food or supplies could get in. After 91 days, without any food, and with disease throughout the city, Cuauhtemoc finally surrendered to the Spanish on August 13, 1521. The Spanish destroyed Tenochtitlan. They started a Spanish colony that they named New Spain. The Aztec Empire had ended.\nWeapons.\nThere were many different reasons why the Spanish were able to take over the Aztec Empire.\nDifferent wepons were used through the battle to help Cortes overrule the aztecs.\nFirst, their weapons and armor were better than the Aztecs'. Aztec warriors had only cotton armour and shields made of wood or reeds to protect them. The Spanish had metal armor and shields.\nFor weapons, Aztec warriors had a few choices:\nNone of these weapons could compare to the conquistadors' guns and steel swords. Their horses and war dogs gave them even more of an advantage against the Aztecs.\nReligion.\nAs early as 1528, reports have said that Montezuma II thought Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. Aztec legends said that Quetzalcoatl would return as a man, and Cort\u00e9s had arrived on Quetzalcoatl's birthday. Aztec writings from the time say that when Montezuma II greeted Cort\u00e9s, he gave an abdication speech, giving up the Aztec throne to \"Quetzalcoatl-Cort\u00e9s\":\nAs historian David Carrasco explains: Motecuhzoma II is welcoming \"Quetzalcoatl-Cortes ... back to his city in order to reoccupy the throne which has been guarded by Montezuma and the other [kings] ... The ancient prophecy has been fulfilled and the returning lord is invited to occupy his throne and visit the palace. There could hardly be a clearer statement of returning the sovereignty to the original king.\"\nOther causes.\nSome historians say that the Spanish conquistadors were not the only reason the Aztec Empire fell apart. By 1519, the Empire had other problems that made it easier for Spain to take it over. For example:\nCortes wanted to conquer the aztecs for gold glory and god. \nBecause of these things, many people in the Aztec Empire were unhappy. Some of them helped the Spanish conquistadors take over the Empire. Some historians, like Brian Fagan and Nadia Durrani, say that the Empire would have fallen apart even if the Spanish had never come. However, because so many people had died of smallpox, there were also not enough people left to fight against the conquistadors when they did come.\nAfter the Empire.\nUnder Spanish control, the Aztec Empire did not exist any more. The Spanish tried to change the Aztecs into Catholics and make them act like Spanish people. They made it easier to change from Aztec rule to Spanish rule by letting many Aztec nobles become Spanish nobles.\nThe conquistadors rewarded people who had helped them defeat the Aztecs. Many received an Encomienda, a village full of Aztecs who were forced to work for them. This was not much different from what many serfs had done during the Aztec Empire. However, workers were badly abused, and many died. Because of this, a Spanish bishop named Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas suggested using African slaves to work in New Spain instead. Later, when he saw how much worse African slaves were treated, las Casas changed his mind about this.\nBy 1680, 94% of the Aztec population had died. This happened for a few reasons:\nAfter taking over the Aztec Empire, the Spanish conquistadors moved on to take over other parts of Mesoamerica. During the same 160 years from 1520 to 1680 between 85% and 95% of Mesoamerica's native population died."}

In 2010, an error in the code led the virus to spread outside the test labs and infect computers around the world.\nBoth the United States and Israel have been accused of developing and releasing Stuxnet. In 2012 the US confirmed that it developed Stuxnet with Israel.\nStuxnet targets PLCs. They control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Stuxnet works by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks. It then looks for Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.\nStuxnet is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected USB flash drive. The worm then spreads across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling a PLC. If it doesn't find a target, Stuxnet becomes dormant inside the computer.\nStuxnet is special for different reasons:\nEven though it targeted PLCs only very few were infected. The software is written to infect a specific set of PLC, with well-defined modules. In the case of a personal computer, it will infect any computer running the right software."}

It went down near the Normandy coast off Barfleur, on 25 November 1120. Only two of those aboard survived. Those who drowned included William Adelin, the only surviving legitimate son and heir of King Henry I of England. William Adelin's death led to a succession crisis and a chain of events that changed the history of England. \nShipwreck.\nThe \"White Ship\" was a new ship captained by Thomas FitzStephen. His father Stephen FitzAirard had been captain of the ship \"Mora\" for William the Conqueror when he invaded England in 1066. FitzStephen offered his ship to Henry I of England to use it to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy. Henry had already made other plans, but allowed many members of his royal court to take the \"White Ship.\" This included his only son, William Adelin. It also included his illegitimate son Richard of Lincoln, his illegitimate daughter Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche and many other nobles. According to the chronicler Orderic Vitalis, the crew asked William Adelin for wine and he supplied it to them in great abundance. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board although some had left before the ship sailed due to the excessive drinking going on.\nThe ship's captain, Thomas FitzStephen, was ordered by the revelers to catch up to and pass the king's ship which had already sailed. The \"White Ship\" was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials. This made the captain and crew certain they could reach England first. But when the ship left in the dark, its port side struck a submerged rock called \"Quilleb\u0153uf\" and the ship quickly sank. William Adelin got into a small boat and could have survived but he turned back to try to save his half-sister, Matilda (Countess of Perche), when he heard her cries for help. His boat filled with water when others tried to get in to save themselves, and William drowned along with them. According to Orderic Vitalis only two survived by clinging to the rock all night. One was a butcher from Rouen, the second was Geoffrey de l'Aigle. The chronicler further claimed that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived, he let himself drown rather than face the King.\nOne legend says that the ship was doomed because priests were not allowed to board it in the customary manner.\nDescent into anarchy.\nA direct result of William Adelin's death was the period known as the Anarchy. The \"White Ship\" disaster had left Henry I with only one legitimate child, a second daughter named Matilda. Although Henry I had forced his barons to swear an oath to support Matilda as his heir on several occasions, a woman had never ruled in England in her own right. Matilda was also unpopular because she was married to Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou. He was a traditional enemy of England's Norman nobles. Upon Henry's death in 1135, the English barons were not sure they wanted Matilda as queen Regnant. \nOne of Henry I's male relatives, Stephen of Blois, the king's nephew by his sister Adela, usurped Matilda as well as his older brothers William and Theobald to become king. Stephen had allegedly planned to travel on the \"White Ship\" but had left just before it sailed; Orderic Vitalis attributes this to a sudden bout of diarrhoea.\nAfter Henry I's death, Matilda and her husband Geoffrey of Anjou, the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, started a long and devastating war against Stephen and his allies for control of the English throne. The period called the Anarchy lasted from 1135 to 1153 with devastating effect, especially in southern England.\nA historian who lived about that time William of Malmesbury wrote: "}

When looking towards the bow (while on the boat), the left-hand side of the boat is the port side. Starboard is the corresponding word for the right side of a boat.\nParts of a Boat: Boating Terminology.\nPort and starboard are nautical terms for left and right, respectively. Port is the left-hand side of or direction from a vessel, facing forward. Starboard is the right-hand side, facing forward. Since port and starboard never change, they are clear references that do not depend on which way the observer is facing.\nHistory.\nThe term \"starboard\" comes from the Old English \"steorbord\", meaning the side on which the ship is steered. Before ships had rudders on their center-lines, they were steered with a steering oar at the stern of the ship. Because more people are right-handed it was placed on the right-hand side. The term is similar to the Old Norse \"st\u00fdri\" (rudder) and \"bor\u00f0\" (side of a ship). Since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat, it would tie up at wharf on the other side. For this reason the left side was called \"port\". \nFormerly \"larboard\" was used instead of \"port\". This is from Middle English \"ladebord\" and the term \"lade\" is related to the modern \"load\". \"Larboard\" sounded very similar to \"starboard\" and in 1844 the Royal Navy ordered that \"port\" be used instead. \"Larboard\" continued to be used well into the 1850s by whalers. In Old English the word was \"b\u00e6cbord\", which is used in other European languages, for example as the German \"backbord\" and the French term \"b\u00e2bord\" (derived in turn from Middle Dutch).\nNavigational lights.\nAt night, the port side of a boat or aircraft is indicated by a red navigation light at the bow. The opposite side of the bow has a green one to help avoid collisions. The \"International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea\" state that a ship on the left must give way to a ship on its right. If the courses of two boats are intersecting, the helmsman usually gives way to a red light by going around the stern of the stand-on vessel (the vessel that does not need to change course). A saying for this is:\n\"If to starboard red appear,&lt;br&gt; \n'tis your duty to keep clear...&lt;br&gt; \nGreen to green, red to red&lt;br&gt; \nperfect safety, go ahead.\""}

Generally, the prosecutor has the burden of proof and is required to prove their case to this standard. This means that the version of events being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no \"reasonable doubt\" in the mind of a \"reasonable person\" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would \"not\" affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty. Beyond \"the shadow of a doubt\" is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt. But this term extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard. The term \"reasonable doubt\" is most commonly used.\nIf doubt \"does\" affect a \"reasonable person's\" belief that the defendant is guilty, then the jury is not satisfied beyond \"reasonable doubt\". The precise meaning of words such as \"reasonable\" and \"doubt\" are usually defined within jurisprudence of the applicable country. A related idea is William Blackstone's formulation: \"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer\"."}

This is where a judge or group of judges opens an official inquiry and decides the case.\nThe adversarial system is the two-part system under which criminal law courts operate. On one side is the prosecution who usually represents the government. The other side is the defense who represents the defendant. Each party may call witnesses and ask questions. Each party may present evidence based on legal ethics and that is approved by the court. For example, legal ethics prevent a lawyer from calling a witness they know will lie on the witness stand. Justice is served when the most effective adversary is able to convince the jury or judge that his or her case is the correct one."}

In civil law systems, similar provisions are typically part of their civil or criminal codes and known collectively as \"periods of prescription\". When the period of time specified in a statute of limitations passes, the statute of limitations provides an absolute defense to the legal claim.\nThe intention of these laws is to make sure legal cases are brought to trial in a reasonable length of time.\nA statute of limitations restricts when a case may be filed, but is not a deadline for the completion of a case. If a case is filed during the period specified in the statute of limitations, the case may be heard and decided by the court even after that period expires.\nCivil lawsuits.\nThe statute of limitations is determined by the cause of action, and different causes of action may have different limitations period even within the same state or country. The limitations period may be extended to ensure fairness to the parties, for example, if the person making the claim was a minor at the time the legal claim arose, or if the defendant committed a wrongful act to conceal the legal claim from the injured plaintiff.\nTypically the statute of limitations must be raised by the defense after a lawsuit is filed. If the defense does not claim that the legal action is barred by the statute of limitations, a court may find that the defense has been waived and allow a late-filed lawsuit to continue.\nCriminal prosecution.\nWhen a statute of limitations expires (runs out) in a criminal case, if the defendant or judge raises a statute of limitations defense, the person can no longer be placed on trial for that cause. In many cases the statute of limitations is jurisdictional, so that a defendant can get a dismissal of a charge even if the defense is not raised, but in some cases the defendant risks waiving the statute of limitations defense if it is not raised before conviction."}

It means literally the cause or reason why a party can make a legal case under the law. The term also refers to the legal theory upon which a plaintiff brings a lawsuit (such as breach of contract, battery, or false imprisonment). The legal document which carries a claim is often called a Statement of Claim in English law, or a Complaint in U.S. federal practice and in many U.S. states. A complaint identifies the court's jurisdiction, the alleged facts and the relief the plaintiff wants. It can be any communication notifying the party to whom it is addressed of an alleged fault which resulted in damages. This is often expressed in amount of money the receiving party should pay or reimburse.\nFiling.\nTo pursue a cause of action, a plaintiff pleads or alleges facts in a complaint, the pleading that starts a lawsuit. A cause of action generally includes both the legal theory (the legal wrong the plaintiff claims to have suffered) and the remedy (the relief a court is asked to grant). Often the facts or circumstances that allow a person to seek judicial relief may create multiple causes of action. Although it is fairly easy to file a Statement of Claim in most jurisdictions. If it is not done properly, then the filing party may lose his case due to simple technicalities.\nThere are a number of specific causes of action, including: contract-based actions, statutory causes of action, torts such as assault, battery, invasion of privacy and fraud. The points a plaintiff must prove to win a given type of case are called the \"elements\" of that cause of action. For example, for a claim of negligence, the elements are: the (existence of a) duty, breach (of that duty), proximate cause (legal cause), and damages. If a complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support every element of a claim, the court, upon motion by the opposing party, may dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted.\nResponding.\nThe defendant to a cause of action must file an \"Answer\" to the complaint in which the \"claims\" can be admitted or denied. The answer may also contain counterclaims in which the \"Counterclaim Plaintiff\" states its own causes of action. Finally, the answer may contain affirmative defenses. Most defenses must be raised at the first possible opportunity. Either in the answer or by motion or are considered to be waived. "}

People who have been determined to be insane have been exempt from full criminal punishment since the Code of Hammurabi. There are different definitions of legal insanity in different jurisdictions. A finding of insanity usually results in the defendant being confined in a mental health facility instead of a prison. The first to use this defense was Daniel Sickles when he killed his wife's lover Francis Barton Key (son of Francis Scott Key) in 1859.\nApplication.\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States, use of the insanity defense is rare. However, insanity pleas have steadily increased in the UK. Mitigating factors, including things not eligible for the insanity defense like intoxication (or, more frequently, diminished capacity), may lead to reduced charges or reduced sentences. \nThe question of who bears the burden of proof is an issue in the United States. Before the John Hinckley, Jr. trial the burden of proof rested with the government in most states. Afterwards many of these states required the defense to prove the defendant was legally insane. Where the state still bears the burden of proof, the standard for the prosecution is beyond a reasonable doubt. Where the defense bears the burden, the standard is preponderance of the evidence (a lower standard).\nExpert testimony.\nThe insanity defense is based on evaluations by forensic mental health professionals with the appropriate test according to the jurisdiction. Their testimony guides the jury (or judge in a bench trial). But they may not testify to the defendant's criminal responsibility. This is for the jury or judge to decide. Mental health experts may testify as to whether at the time of the crime the defendant understood what he did was wrong. If the defendant were acting under a delusion at the time and could still determine right from wrong, he is not insane and may be punished. "}

The decision is the result of a majority vote.\nArbitration (hearing).\nArbitration includes an agreement in advance by both parties to comply with the decision of the arbitrator(s). The process includes a hearing in which both parties may be heard. The arbitrator(s) reviews the evidence in the case and makes a decision. One that is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts.\nMediation.\nAnother form of alternative dispute resolution is mediation. Mediation and arbitration both use neutral third parties. For that reason they are sometimes confused. One difference is that a mediator does not make any decisions. Instead the mediator works towards getting both parties to agree. Unlike Arbitration, there is usually only one mediator. Another difference is that mediation is usually non-binding. Mediation is used more often in smaller disputes or when the matter is kept confidential. In some jurisdictions, mediation is required before a case can come to court. "}

It is to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury. The rules for damages can and frequently do vary based on the type of claim which is presented (e.g., breach of contract versus a tort claim) and the jurisdiction. Damages are not the same as court costs which includes the costs to bring a legal case to court. The losing party may also have to pay court costs.\nCategories.\nIn common law countries, damages are usually categorized into compensatory (or actual) damages, and punitive damages. Compensatory damages are further categorized into special damages and general damages. Special damages include economic losses such as loss of earnings, property damage and medical expenses. General damages are noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress. Statutory damages are those required by statute.\nCompensatory damages.\nCompensatory damages are paid to compensate the claimant for loss, injury, or harm suffered as a result of another's negligence (tort law). Expectation damages are used in contract law. In civil law countries, these are called \"ordinary damages\" and may be limited to actual loss.\nPunitive damages.\nGenerally, punitive damages, which are also termed \"exemplary damages\" in the United Kingdom, are not awarded in order to compensate the plaintiff, but in order to reform or deter the defendant. They are also to intended to be an example to others not to do the same thing. Punitive damages are awarded when it is determined that compensatory damages are not enough. Punitive damages are awarded over and above the amount of compensatory damages, such as in the event of malice or intent. Great judicial restraint is expected to be exercised in their use. In the United States punitive damages awards are subject to the limitations imposed by the due process of law clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nPunitive damages in most civil law countries are not awarded. \nStatutory damages.\nStatutory damages are an amount stated within the statute rather than calculated based on the degree of harm to the plaintiff. Lawmakers will provide for statutory damages for acts in which it is difficult to determine the value of the harm to the victim. Someone breaking the law can entitle the victim to a statutory award. This is even if no actual injury happened. \nFor example, United States Civil Code 18 USC \u00a7\u00a72520 provides for statutory damages to victims of various wiretapping offenses."}

It is what is often what is considered fair and right under natural law. It is used when the laws themselves do not address an issue or are inadequate in some way. Examples of equity decisions include imposing a lien, correcting a property line or ordering someone to do something to prevent damage.\nHistory.\nCommon law in England can be traced back to the Norman conquest. The laws, such as they were then, did not address every concern. At first, a subject (of the king) had to petition the king to ask to be heard in his court. One of the first instances of this was in 1070 when Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury had a case against Odo, Earl of Kent, the king's brother. The archbishop petitioned that lands taken by Odo be restored. Rules of equity began when it became apparent that the common law courts could not solve all legal problems. The king set up courts of chancery (equity). By the 1800s the equity courts were becoming obsolete. In 1875 Parliament did away with the chancery courts altogether.\nStates in New England followed the English tradition of maintaining separate courts for law and equity. Others, however, combined their courts with both types of jurisdiction. This is what Congress did with respect to the US federal courts. United States bankruptcy courts are the one example of US federal courts which operate as courts of equity."}

In a system of social classes they are those without title or rank. Since the 20th century, the term \"common people\" has been used in its place. It refers to typical members of society in contrast to highly privileged (in either wealth or influence).\nHistory.\nIn Europe, a concept of common people started in the classical antiquity of ancient Rome around the 6th century BC. The Roman social division was into patricians (nobles) and plebeians (commoners). The division may have been instituted by Servius Tullius, as an alternative to the previous clan based divisions that had been responsible for internecine conflict. The ancient Greeks generally had no concept of class and their leading social divisions were simply non-Greeks, free-Greeks and slaves. With the growth of Christianity in the 4th century AD, a new world view arose in European thinking about social division. This continued until at least early modern times. Saint Augustine stated that social division was a result of the Fall of Man. The three leading divisions were considered to be the priesthood (clergy), the nobility, and the common people. Sometimes this would be expressed as \"those who prayed\", \"those who fought\" and \"those who worked\". The Latin terms for the three classes \u2013 \"oratores\", \"bellatores\" and \"laboratores\" \u2013 are often found even in modern textbooks, and have been used in sources since the 9th century."}

They have lost their gene expression in the cell or their ability to code protein.

Although not protein-coding, the DNA of pseudogenes may be functional. It may be similar to other kinds of non-coding DNA which have a regulatory role.\nMost have some gene-like features. They lack protein-coding ability resulting from a variety of disabling mutations, or their inability to encode RNA (such as with rRNA pseudogenes). \nPseudogenes are generally thought of as the last stop for genomic material that is to be removed from the genome, so they are often labeled as junk DNA. Pseudogenes contain fascinating biological and evolutionary histories in their sequences. This is due to a pseudogene's shared ancestry with a functional gene. In the same way that Darwin thought of two species as having a shared common ancestry followed by millions of years of evolutionary divergence (see speciation), a pseudogene and its associated functional gene also share a common ancestor and have diverged as separate genetic entities over millions of years."}

It is a delaying tactic intended to slow down the advance of an enemy, instead of stopping it. The tactic buys time by yielding to the enemy slowly and usually causes additional casualties. A defense in depth can slow down an advancing army and cause it to lose momentum.\nExamples.\nHannibal used the tactic at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC. Facing a much larger Roman army, he placed his less experienced soldiers in the center. On either side were his most experienced fighters. When the Romans advanced, his center gradually moved back while the troops on the wings began to surround the Romans. That was the largest slaughter of Roman soldiers in the history of the republic.\nThe classic example is medieval hill forts and castles with rings of defenses (usually walls). The inner circles of defenders support the outer circles with missiles fire. The attacker has to breach each line of defense exhausting himself in the process.\nThe German Army used the tactic in 1917, during World War I. The Germans used it to great effect against both the French and the British Armies until July 1918. The arrival of the US Army, which joined the French and the British, ended that German tactic.\nStrategy.\nA properly-planned defense in depth can be used to reduce or eliminate any advantage an attacking force might have,such as superior numbers. The defender places the object of his attack behind several layers of defense. The defender then lets the attacker wear down his forces while they slowly give ground and then he moves back to the next layer of defense.\nCarl von Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and the martial art of Bud\u014d all agreed that the preferred form of war was defense. Clausewitz stated that defense provided the defenders with additional . A defense in depth can prevent an enemy from surrounding a position and provides an excellent opportunity to counterattack. A defense in space is not being there when an enemy attacks. A defense in time means slowing down or blocking an enemy when it attacks.\nDelaying action.\nA similar tactic is called a delaying action. The object is for a smaller force to harass a larger force and to delay its advance while inflicting as much damage as possible to the larger force without directly engaging it. This allows the defending army's main force to disengage an enemy while maintaining good order. The main force is given the time necessary to set up a new defensive position. The small force protecting the larger force is called a rearguard.\nA famous rearguard example was given in the \"Song of Roland\". The nephew of Charlemagne, Roland, commanded the rearguard at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. He and his men protected the rear of the Frankish army while it retreated back to France. In his delaying action, Roland and all of his men were killed in an ambush."}

These two gene clusters are thought to have arisen from a precursor gene being duplicated, about 500 million years ago. \nThe biggest gene family is said to be the olfaction genes. The homeobox genes are another important group. \nGenes for the immune system include several gene families. They code for the major histocompatibility complex, and the immunoglobulins. The toll-like receptors are the main sensors of infection in mammals."}

Evidence is used to show something is either true or false. Evidence has to follow rules in most jurisdictions. In the United States, for example, evidence was based on legal precedent until 1975. In that year Congress created the Federal Rules of Evidence. They became the official rules that all forms of evidence must follow in federal courts. Most states in the US use rules based on the federal rules. China, while a civil law country, has followed much of the US Federal Rules of Evidence in their \" Uniform Provisions of Evidence\".\nA subpoena can be used to require a person or organization to provide documents used for evidence.\nAdmissibility of evidence.\nIn most jurisdictions there are exclusionary rules that automatically suppress certain kinds of evidence.

It is important for tribunals, judges, juries and arbitrators to be impartial. It is equally important for the legal systems themselves to be impartial.\nJudges and tribunals.\nJudges cannot favor one party over another or give more weight to one side's claims than the other. Judges learn about the law from outside the courtroom and before a trial begins. Because of this a judge may have an opinion regarding the law. When a judge expresses these views he or she is not being impartial.\nJuries.\nIn the US legal system, juries are screened and individuals selected by a process called \"voir dire\". Both the prosecution and the defense question jury candidates before a judge. This is to see if they can remain impartial. Any person having a personal interest in the outcome of the trial or who is obviously biased may be removed. This is called \"striking\" a juror. It is rare to have more than 10% of potential jurors struck from a trial. Trial by jury began in the United Kingdom. Except for cases where there is a provision by the law, it is the right of every person accused of a crime to have an impartial jury trial. More and more criminal trials are held without a jury. The less severe crimes are tried by magistrates. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right to a fair trial. In Canada juries are made up of 12 ordinary persons, male or female, who are expected to be impartial triers of fact. They decide whether the Crown (the prosecution) has made its case. Judges have the option of increasing the jury to 13 or 14 jurors, but only 12 may vote on the guilt or innocence of the accused. \nJuries in Scotland have 15 jurors. In many European civil law countries and Japan, juries can be made up of laypersons and judges. Also the opposing council may not be able to strike jurors as in the United States. \nMany believe the Magna Carta first guaranteed a right to trial by one's peers. The Latin \"judicium parium\" does not mean a trial by jury. The word \"judicium\" in the language of the day meant a judge. The term \"liber homo\", usually translated as \"freeman\", at that time were a limited class in England. So it did not mean every person."}

They then investigate to learn all the facts. Finally they make a decision. Under civil law, judiciary decisions are not a critical part of forming civil laws. Under Dutch civil law for example, there are so many civil laws that it becomes difficult for lawyers and judges to know if they have found all the laws that apply to a case. Even with all the laws, not every situation is covered. The civil court will research everything it can on the subject, then make a decision. For this reason those who start a legal case never know for certain what the decision will be."}

A lien is usually a public record. The owner of the property is called the \"lienee\". The creditor or person holding the lien is called the \"lienor\" or \"lien holder\".\nIn the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of legal interests. It includes other forms of mortgage or charge. In the USA, a lien is a \"non-possessory\" security interests meaning the lien holder does not usually possess the property.\nIn other common law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest. The holder of a lien right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the USA, in other countries it refers to a purely \"possessory\" form of security interest. When possession of the property is lost, the lien is released. "}
