{"id": "101481", "revid": "890988", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101481", "title": "Book of Revelation", "text": "The Book of Revelation, which is sometimes called Revelation to John, Apocalypse of John, or Revelation of Jesus Christ is the last book of the New Testament in the Bible.\nTitle.\nThe last book of the New Testament is usually called the \"Book of Revelation\" or simply \"Revelation\". Some of the earliest manuscripts have the title of \"The Revelation of John\" (). Later manuscripts usually have the title of \"The Revelation of the Theologian\" (). This is why the Authorized King James Version calls Revelation the \"Revelation of Saint John the Divine\" (\"divine\" was a seventeenth century word for \"theologian\".)\nIn Greek, the word \"apocalypse\" means \"revealing\" or \"unveiling\".\nIntroduction.\nSome people consider Revelation to be the most difficult book in the Bible. Over the course of the book the author has two visions. There are many different ways to interpret these visions, and there have been many arguments over which way is right. \nAuthorship.\nThere is some disagreement over whether the John who wrote the letters of John, the John who wrote The Gospel of John, and the John who wrote the Book of Revelation are the same person. The person writing Revelation called himself \"John\". He also wrote that he was on Patmos, an island in the Aegean Sea, when he saw his first vision.\nContent.\nThe book begins by introducing John as the author and has letters to seven churches of that day. Some think that these churches also represent periods of history. Various visions follow which are highly symbolic which allows many different interpretations. They have been understood by various groups to represent past and future events. Some believe that many of these prophecies have already been fulfilled. Others think they will be fulfilled at the end of time. Others think they tell about the victory of Christ over all enemies, but do not refer to specific events. Parts of the book seem to have used symbols and codes in order to hide their meaning from outsiders. This includes the mysterious \"number of the beast\" or 666. The book ends with a vision of the faithful souls in the next life rejoicing around the throne of God. \nSome of the things that Christians talk about come from the book of Revelation. These include the Millennium which is a 1000 year period when Christ will rule the earth. The Battle of Armageddon tells about a final war between good and evil. The word Armegeddon is sometimes used for any very huge war which ends the world. Both of these events are thought to be literal and future by some, and figurative by others. Virtually all Christians agree that there will be a Second Coming of Christ. This is found in many places in the Bible. Christians do not all agree on the details of how it will happen. Many verses in the Book of Revelation are about those details.\nThe book has been important to Christians in many places and times when they were suffering persecution. At those times, the persecuted persons found parts of the book that could have been referring to them. Since some verses refer to the afterlife, they have traditionally been used at funerals."}

At the age of sixteen he became apprentice in a pharmacy and then a pharmacist himself (like his father). In 1839, at the age of 20, wrote his first work (\"Heinrichs IV. erste Liebe\", now lost). His first published work, the novella \"Geschwisterliebe\" (or \"Sibling Love\"), appeared in the \"Berlin Figaro\" in December 1839.\nHis first job as apothecary was in Dresden after which he returned to his father's shop, now in the provincial town of Letschin in the Oderbruch region. In this time Fontane published articles in the Leipzig newspaper \"Die Eisenbahn\" (railway) and translated Shakespeare. In 1843, he joined a literary club called Tunnel \u00fcber der Spree (i.e. Tunnel over the river Spree) in Berlin where he came into contact with many of the most important German writers such as Theodor Storm, Joseph von Eichendorff and Gottfried Keller.\nNewspaper writer and critic.\nIn 1844 Fontane enrolled in the Prussian army and set out on the first of many journeys to England. There he learned about old English ballads. Soon afterwards he wrote ballads himself. At that time he became engaged to his future wife, Emilie Rouanet-Kummer, whom he had first met when still at school.\nHe was - very short - enganged in the revolutionary events of the revolution of 1848. In 1849 he quit his job as an apothecary and became a full-time journalist and writer. In order to support his family he took a job as a writer for the Prussian intelligence agency \"Centralstelle f\u00fcr Pre\u00dfangelegenheiten\" which was meant to influence the press towards a German national cause. Again he specialised in British affairs, and the agency sent him as correspondent to London for a couple of years. His wife and two sons followed him there. While still in London he quit his government job and, on his return to Berlin, became editor of the conservative \"Kreuzzeitung\" (newspaper).\nLondon.\nHis books about Britain include \"Ein Sommer in London\" (1854); \"Aus England, Studien und Briefe\" (1860) and \"Jenseits des Tweed, Bilder und Briefe aus Schottland\" (1860). At the period, and following the fashion of Walter Scott, traditional British stories were still \"en vogue\" on the continent. His \"Gedichte\" (1851) and ballads \"M\u00e4nner und Helden\" (1860) tell of Britain's glories in days gone by.\nBack in Germany, Fontane became particularly interested in the Mark Brandenburg region. He was especially proud of its past achievements and delighted in the growth of its capital city, Berlin. His fascination with the countryside surrounding Berlin may be seen in his delightfully picturesque \"Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg\" (1862-1882, 5 vols.).\nPrussian War.\nIn 1870, he quit his job at the \"Kreuzzeitung\" and became theater critic for the liberal \"Vossische Zeitung\" (newspaper). This job he kept until retirement. He had already written about Prussia's war against Denmark and the Austro-Prussian War. Then he went to write about the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and was taken prisoner. He remained in French captivity for three months. His experiences there are set down in \"Kriegsgefangen Erlebtes 1870 (1871)\"; subsequently he published his observations on the campaign in \"Der Krieg gegen Frankreich 1870-71\" (1874-1876).\nLater years.\nAt the ripe age of 57 Fontane finally took to what he would be remembered for, the novel. His fine historical novel \"Vor dem Sturm\" (1878) was followed by a series of novels of modern life, notably \"L'Adultera\" (1882), a book about adultery which was considered so risqu\u00e9 that it took Fontane two years to find a publisher. In his novels \"Frau Jenny Treibel\", \"Irrungen, Wirrungen\", and \"Effi Briest\" (1894), he found his very own tone, he wrote about insights into the lives of the nobility as well as the \"common man\"; his achievement there was later described as poetic realism. In \"Der Stechlin\" (1899), his last finished novel, Fontane adapted the realistic methods and social criticism of contemporary French fiction to the conditions of Prussian life.\nReferences.\nSee Thomas Mann's 1910 essay, \"The Old Fontane,\" in \"Essays of Three Decades\" (Knopf, 1947). Very fine."}

About 30% of the force will be Roman Catholics by 2011. \nUniform and symbols.\nThe colour of the PSNI uniform is green. The PSNI badge has Saint Patrick's saltire on it and six other symbols. They are the scales of justice, the harp, the torch, the olive branch, the shamrock and a crown.\nThe flag of the PSNI is the badge in the centre of a dark green field."}

They give small loans (known as microcredit or \"grameencredit\" ) to poor people without asking for money before the loan is given. The word \"Grameen\", is made of the word \"gram\" or \"village\", and means \"of the village\". The system of this bank is based on the idea that the poor have skills but have no chance to use their skills without some money. The bank also controls some businesses, such as fabric, telephone and energy companies. Most of the banks loans go to women.\nThe Grameen Bank was started 1976 when Professor Muhammad Yunus, a Fulbright scholar and Professor at University of Chittagong, researched how to provide banking for the rural poor. In October 1983, the Grameen Bank Project was made into an independent bank by the government. The group and its first member, Muhammad Yunus, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.\nSome people have said the banks prices are too expensive and put people in a debt-trap. Some have also said that the bank would not work if people did not give donations. At the same time, it is often seen as a success story in microfinance and as the guide for other groups around the world.\nHistory.\nMuhammad Yunus, the banks first member, earned a Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States. During the Bangladesh famine of 1974 he gave a small loan of USD\u00a027 to a group of 42 families so that they could make small items and sell them without owing too much money. Yunus believed that a lot less people would be poor around Bangladesh if they could find small loans.\nThe Grameen Bank (\"Bank of the Villages\", in the Bengali language) is the product of Yunus' ideas. The bank began as a research project by Yunus and the Rural Economics Project at Bangladesh's University of Chittagong. They gave out some small loans and waited to know what would happen. In 1976, the village of Jobra and other villages surrounding the University of Chittagong became the first places where Grameen Bank loaned money to people. The Bank was very successful and with support from the main Bangladesh Bank, gave loans for the Tangail District (to the north of the capital, Dhaka). The bank's success continued and it soon gave loans in many areas of Bangladesh. On 2 October 1983, the project was made into an independent bank, by the Bangladeshi government. Bankers from ShoreBank, a community development bank in Chicago, helped Yunus by making Grameen Bank a part of Shorebank with money from the Ford Foundation. After the 1998 flood of Bangladesh, many people could not pay their debts to Grameen for a few years. By the beginning of 2005, the bank had loaned over USD\u00a04.7 billion to poor people.\nGrameen Bank now loans money to poor people all over India. By 2006, India had over 2,100 Grameen Bank branches. Its success has inspired similar projects in more than 40 countries around the world and has made World Bank to take an initiative to finance Grameen-type schemes.\nThe bank gets help with money. In the mid-1990s, the bank started getting most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has been borrowing money. The Government of Bangladesh guarantees that money borrowed by the Grameen Bank will be repaid.\nHow the bank works.\nGrameen Bank is best known for solidarity lending. The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the \"Sixteen Decisions\". At every branch of Grameen Bank the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them.\nThere is solidarity lending in over 43 countries. Each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group does not need to give a guarantee for a loan. The loan is made to only one person but the whole group is to make sure that the money is repaid. Each member has to pay for their own loan but if they have problems the group may help them pay because the group would not get any more loans from Grameen if all the groups loans were not paid.\nGrameen Bank does not take people to court if they cannot pay, the system works on trust only. Solidarity groups agree with Grameen to save enough for extra payments in case they cannot pay every time.\nNot many women in India can have loans from big banks so 97% of Grameens loans go to women. Women get treated very badly in some countries, and groups, such as the World Bank are researching to know if small loans are helping women around the world. \nOver 98 percent of Grameens loans have been paid back but the Wall Street Journal says that 20% of the loans took more than a year longer than the time agreed to pay the loan back. Grameen says that more than half of its borrowers in Bangladesh (close to 50 million) now: have all children of school age in school, all household members eating three meals a day, a clean toilet, a rainproof house, clean drinking water and can pay 300 taka-a-week (around 4 USD) towards their loans.\nVillage Phone Program.\nOne of the things Grameen Bank does for poor people is the Village Phone program. Women entrepreneurs can start a business providing a payphone service in rural areas of Bangladesh. The Village Phone Program was awarded the 2004 Petersburg Prize of EUR 100,000 for Technology to Development. The Development Gateway Foundation said:\n...Grameen has created a new class of women entrepreneurs who have raised themselves from poverty. Moreover, it has improved the livelihoods of farmers and others who are provided access to critical market information and lifeline communications previously unattainable in some 28,000 villages of Bangladesh. More than 55,000 phones are currently in operation, with more than 80 million people benefiting from access to market information, news from relatives, and more.\nStruggling members program.\nIn 2003, Grameen Bank started a new loan program, different from the Solidarity Group, to help the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is made to give small loans to beggars. The loans cost only the amount of the loan and the repayment take a long time, for example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US $1.50) can pay only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week and only repays 100 taka.\nThe bank does not force the beggars to give up begging but tries to get them selling low-priced items. The Global Microcredit Summit in 2006 by one of the banks managers says that by May 2006, around 73,000 beggars have taken loans of about 58.32 million taka (approx. USD\u00a0833,150) and repaid 34.78 million taka (about USD\u00a0496,900).\nStatistics.\nGrameen Bank is owned by the people who borrow the money, mostly women. The borrowers own 94% of the bank, and the other 6% is owned by the Government of Bangladesh.\nIn October 2007, the bank had 7.34 million borrowers, and 97% of those were women. \nThe number of borrowers had more than doubled since 2003, when the bank had only 3.12 million members. In October 2007, the Bank had a staff of over 24,703 employees and 2,468 branches covering 80,257 villages. There were 43,681 villages covered in the year 2003.\nSince its start, the bank has loaned 347.75 billion taka (USD\u00a06.55 billion). 313.11 billion taka (USD\u00a05.87 billion) has been repaid. The bank says 98.35% of loans are repaid. In 1998, 95% of loans were repaid. However, many critics doubt this recovery rate and the definition that Grameen uses to come up with this rate.\nNobel Peace Prize.\nGrameen Bank received awards such as, the Bangladesh Independence Day Award, in 1994. The bank got its best known award on 13 October 2006, when the Nobel Committee awarded Grameen Bank and its first member, Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\" The Nobel Foundation says: \nFrom modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty. Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of micro-credit that have sprung up around the world.\nMosammat Taslima Begum, used her first loan of 16-euro (20-dollar) from the bank in 1992 to buy a goat and subsequently became a successful entrepreneur and one of the elected board members of the bank. She collected the Nobel Prize for Grameen Bank on 10 December 2006, at the prize awarding ceremony in Oslo City Hall.\nGrameen Bank is the only business to have won a Nobel Prize. In a speech given at the presentation ceremony, Professor Ole Danbolt Mj\u00f8s, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said that, by giving the prize to Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to make more contact with the Muslim world, to help women, and on to fight against poverty.\nThe people in Bangladesh were very happy with the Nobel Prize. Some critics asserted that the award affirms neoliberalism.\nRelated groups.\nThe Grameen Bank has grown into over two dozen groups called the Grameen Family of Enterprises. These groups include Grameen Trust, Grameen Fund, Grameen Communications, Grameen Shakti (Grameen Energy), Grameen Telecom, Grameen Shikkha (Grameen Education), Grameen Motsho (Grameen Fisheries), Grameen Baybosa Bikash (Grameen Business Development), Grameen Phone, Grameen Software Limited, Grameen CyberNet Limited, Grameen Knitwear Limited, and Grameen Uddog (owner of the brand Grameen Check).\nOn 11 July 2005 the Grameen Mutual Fund One (GMFO), was listed as an Initial Public Offering. One of the first mutual funds of its kind, GMFO will allow the over four million Grameen bank members, as well as non-members, to buy into Bangladesh's capital markets. The Grameen group is worth over USD\u00a07.4 billion.\nThe Grameen Foundation was based on the work of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and they want to share the Grameen ideas and hurry microfinance to the worlds poorest people. Grameen Foundation USA, which has an A- rating from Charity Watch, supports microfinance institutions worldwide with loan guarantees, training, and technology transfer. As of 2006, Grameen Foundation supports microfinance institutions in the following regions:\nSome people do not agree with Grameen.\nSudhirendar Sharma, a development analyst, says that the Grameen Bank has \"landed poor communities in a perpetual debt-trap\", and that its ultimate benefit goes to the corporations that sell capital goods and infrastructure to the borrowers. Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, who said, \"There is no difference between usurers [Yunus] and corrupt people.\" Hasina also says the bank wants too much in return for the loans. Loans from Grameen Bank cost more than bigger banks, around 20% interest. The Mises Institute's Jeffrey Tucker says that Grameen Bank is not good enough for Indias economy and is a way of giving money to people who are not working."}

It is the first secondary title of WWE. It has been the exclusive secondary championship of WWE's weekly TV show \"Raw\" since April 2017 when the champion at the time Dean Ambrose was moved to the show from \"SmackDown\" in the 2017 Superstar Shake-Up.\nHistory.\nThe WWE Intercontinental Championship was first known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) Intercontinental Championship, until the WWE/WWF 2002 Lawsuit. Following the title's introduction in 1979, Pat Patterson became the inaugural champion on September 15. The title's creation came as a result of Patterson defeating Ted DiBiase to win the WWF North American Championship and defending the title in a fictional tournament held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to be unified with a South American Championship.\nIn March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation bought World Championship Wrestling. Soon after, \"The Invasion\" took place in which the WCW/ECW Alliance was ultimately dismantled. At Survivor Series 2001, the title was unified with the WCW United States Championship. The United States Champion, Edge, won against the Intercontinental Champion, Test, and became the new Intercontinental Champion while the United States Championship became inactive. \nAfter the WWF/WWE name change in 2002, the championship became known as the WWE Intercontinental Championship. It was then unified with the European Championship in a ladder match on July 22, and later the Hardcore Championship on August 26. The Intercontinental Champion, Rob Van Dam, won against the European Champion, Jeff Hardy, and the Hardcore Champion, Tommy Dreamer. As a result, Rob Van Dam was named the last European and Hardcore Champion. Then at No Mercy 2002, it was unified with the World Heavyweight Championship. The World Heavyweight Champion, Triple H, won against the Intercontinental Champion, Kane, and continued to be the World Heavyweight Champion while the Intercontinental Championship became inactive. In May 2003, after fan protests of the retirement of the Intercontinental Title, the title was reactivated by \"Raw\" Co-General Manager, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and was recommissioned to be the secondary championship for the \"Raw\" brand. Shortly after, the WCW United States Championship was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship by the \"SmackDown\"! brand, making the Intercontinental Championship its equal counterpart for the \"Raw\" brand. During the 2009 WWE Draft the two title swapped brands, making the Intercontinental Championship \"SmackDown\" property and the US Title \"Raw\" property. On August 29, 2011, all WWE programming became \"Supershows\" that feature wrestlers from both brands, ending the brand extension. All WWE titles can now be defended at any WWE event. \nAt WrestleMania 32, the title was won by Zack Ryder in a seven-man ladder match, losing it the next night to The Miz on \"Raw\". The brand split was brought back in July of 2016, with the Miz being drafted to \"SmackDown Live\", bringing the Intercontinental title to that show. After a long feud with Dolph Ziggler over the title, the Miz lost the belt to Dean Ambrose on an episode of \"SmackDown Live\" on January 3, 2017. Ambrose was drafted to \"Raw\" in the 2017 Superstar Shake-Up, bringing the Intercontinental title to that show.\nCurrent Champion.\nSami Zayn won the title from Braun Strowman in a 3-on-1 handicap match with Cesaro and Shinsuke Nakamura. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, he could not defend his title. So a tournament was held for the Intercontinental Championship. In finals between Daniel Bryan and Aj Styles, Aj styles won the championship for first time."}

It can be translated as \"many marriages\". It refers to any form of marriage where a person has \"more than one spouse\". There is also a concept called group marriage. In group marriage, all the (adult) members of the group are responsible for all the children.\nA man being married to more than one woman at the same time is called polygyny. A woman being married to more than one man at the same time is called polyandry. \nBoth forms have occurred in humans. Polygyny is much more common, and is practised by millions of people, mostly in Muslim and African countries. According to Muslim \nSharia law, a man can have up to four wives at the same time. In many African Pagan religions, polygamy is a common custom, and there is often no limit to the number of women a man can marry. In most non-Muslim and non-African countries, polygamy is illegal, and a person who has more than one spouse can be prosecuted for bigamy. Some countries, including India, only permit Muslims to be polygamous.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nPolygamy is one of the beliefs of Mormon Fundamentalists. These are Mormons (members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) who strictly follow the teachings of Joseph Smith. Smith felt it was his job to restore plural marriage to the earth. He was married to 33 women. In 1890 the Mormon church officially stopped \"celestial marriages\" (polygamy). Church members who continue to practice plural marriage are excommunicated from the church.\nSethepu/Isithembu.\nIsithembu (Sethepu) is the African practice of a man being able to have more than one wife at the same time. A man may marry again if his current wife or wives cannot have children. He keeps his current wife or wives as divorce is not allowed. A man may marry again if his current wife or wives have not produced male children. He can marry again if a wife does not want children. In some places, if a man dies, his wife or wives are married to his brother. This way his family is cared for. The Swazi culture says a man should have many wives. Polygamy (Isithembu) is normal for men. Woman should have children, which is normal for them."}

{"id": "101609", "revid": "7542954", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101609", "title": "Neal Cassady", "text": "Neal Cassady (February 8, 1926 - February 4, 1968) was an American writer. He was a member of the Beat Generation circle of writers and poets, of the 1950s and 1960s. He was a close friend of Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and was the main inspiration behind Kerouac's breakthrough novel \"On the Road\". Later he was the bus driver of Ken Kesey's \"Merry Pranksters\", during the hippie era.\nEarly life.\nCassady was born in Salt Lake City, literally \"on the road\", as his mother gave birth to him while his parents rode in a car. They later separated, with his father raising young Cassady in Denver, Colorado. He got into trouble often as a boy, and spent part of his teen years in a juvenile facility. While locked up, he began to write letters back and forth with Hal Chase, another member of the (then-future) Beat Generation. Chase told his friends Kerouac and Ginsberg about Cassady, who wanted to meet him. \nAfter he was released, Cassady traveled to New York, marrying sixteen-year-old LuAnne Henderson on the way. He met Ginsberg, and began a homosexual relationship with him (despite Cassady's marriage), and a friendship with Kerouac, recently divorced, who began to teach Cassady about writing. Kerouac's mother, whom he lived with, did not like Cassady, sensing he was just a con artist. \nKerouac knew this was at least partly true, but he did not mind, since he enjoyed Cassady's company. They looked a little like each other, and strangers who met them often guessed the two were brothers. They became very close personally, and felt that they really were brothers, though they came from different parents.\nCassady was a restless person, and his wife got tired of him not giving their marriage the attention it needed. She left him, and returned to her family. Cassady soon forgot about her, and started relationships with other women, and also with men. (He and LuAnne got back together later, but their reconciliation did not last.) Before long, he decided he wanted to travel. Cassady was an expert driver, and had no trouble driving cars at over 100 miles per hour, over long stretches of highway. Kerouac left his mother behind, and joined Cassady on many road trips, across the United States and even into Mexico. When Kerouac got sick in Mexico City, Cassady could not wait for him to get better, and left Kerouac behind at a hospital. Kerouac had to find his own way home, and was angry at Cassady, while Kerouac's mother thought it just proved her suspicions about him. Cassady turned up later, asking Kerouac's forgiveness, which he gave him. Good or bad, Kerouac's experiences with Cassady were what he needed to finish a novel about cross-country travel, which he had wanted to write for years.\nKerouac was married again to Joan Haverty, and in trying to explain his friendship with Cassady to his new wife, he typed a long narrative, using a roll of teletype paper so he did not have to stop to change pages. He spent three weeks working on the narrative almost non-stop. It became the manuscript for his new novel, which he called \"On the Road\".\nHis wife was bothered by the fact that he spent more time working on the manuscript than with her, and separated from him not long after it was finished. Kerouac spent the next six years making changes and improvements to the manuscript, until a publisher agreed to print it as a book. Cassady's name was changed to \"Dean Moriarty\", to make the book appear more fictional than it really was. Kerouac delivered one of the first printed copies of \"On the Road\" in person to Cassady, who did not give Kerouac the reaction he expected. Instead of being happy and proud, Cassady seemed disturbed and scared, by knowing that part of his life was now in print, and his character documented for the public to see.\nWorks.\n\"On the Road\" was published in 1957, and it made both Kerouac and Cassady famous. It did not do much to help their personal lives, however. Both men suffered from public overexposure, as the book became a best-seller. A mistake on the book's jacket made readers think that both men were much younger than they were. Their adventures in the book had happened years earlier, but many people thought they were recent. Some readers wanted to travel with them, or invite them to wild parties, or have sexual intercourse with them. Cassady enjoyed the attention for awhile, but it took its toll on him personally. Fame did not help his second marriage, to Carolyn Robinson, or the family they had together. Kerouac himself hated all the attention he got, and spent most of his time at home with his mother, working on new books, or drinking alcohol. In time, he became an alcoholic, and it ruined his health.\nCassady also partly inspired Allen Ginsberg's \"Howl\", and was mentioned in the poem as \"N.C.\", the \"secret hero\" of Ginsberg's latest writings. \"Howl\" became a landmark work of the 1950s, and added to Ginsberg's and Cassady's fame. Ginsberg handled fame more easily than either Cassady or Kerouac, and had a long public career.\nCassady himself wanted to become a writer, or a jazz musician, but he was not a success at either. He tried to take saxophone lessons, but did not stay with them very long. He mostly worked as a laborer or a brakeman on railroads, before and after \"On the Road\" was published. Some of what he did write was published as a memoir, titled \"The First Third\", but it was his only book. He was more successful at writing letters to friends. One was about his seductions of different women during a train trip. He recorded long talks with Kerouac and Carolyn, about their lives and thoughts, and parts of these went into a later book by Kerouac, titled \"Visions of Cody\". (\"Cody Pomeray\" became Cassady's new fictional name, as Kerouac changed publishers.)\nCassady also sold marijuana to help pay his bills. One customer turned out to be an undercover policeman, who arrested Cassady. He spent a long time in jail. Carolyn had to both work, and try to raise their children alone.\nLater life.\nFreed from jail, Cassady began to travel again. During the 1960s, he joined Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, who traveled back and forth across the United States in a bus, holding \"acid tests\", a name for LSD parties. Cassady drove the bus. He acted as merrily as anyone, and as full of energy as a young man, when the Pranksters were around. In private, though, he was not enjoying his life, and old friends noticed he looked very tired.\nCassady had tried to commit suicide a few times when he was younger, and was unhappy. Once he tried to freeze himself to death, waiting outside in cold temperatures during a car trip, but it took too long, and he got back in the car. Early in 1968, while revisiting Mexico, he was found lying alongside a railroad track, where he had been for a long time. Exposure to harsh weather caused his death, just days short of his 42nd birthday. Nobody knew if he was trying to kill himself or not, this time. A few people who knew him felt that he wanted to die, and had for awhile as he got older, and that Cassady finally got his wish.\nLegacy.\nCassady left an indelible mark on the world of the 1950s and 1960s, through his documented adventures in the works of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and their friends. He also turned up in Kesey's writings about the Merry Pranksters. He inspired later bohemian characters, like Jim Morrison of The Doors. People today still read about his life and times, and wish they were able to meet Cassady, or make friends with him. The people who knew Cassady remembered him fondly later, even if he let them down personally, because he was such a unique (special) person. People loved watching Cassady live his life to the fullest, while he encouraged them to do the same with theirs.\nOther websites.\nNeal Cassady: Behind the Myth (official site)"}

Transformers are an important part of electrical systems. \nTransformers are made in many different sizes, from a very small coupling transformer inside a stage microphone to big units that carry hundreds of MVA used in power grids.\nThe main reason to use a transformer is to make power of one voltage level into power of another voltage level. High voltage is easier to send a long distance, but less voltage is easier and safer to use in the office or home.\nTransformers are used to increase or decrease alternating current (AC) voltage in circuits. The transformer is usually built with two coils around the same core. The primary coil or input coil is connected to supply side while secondary coil supplies power to load. The second one is called the output coil. Energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary by electromagnetism. In power grids many transformers are used. These are networks for delivering electricity from the generator and to the user. \nThe transformers in your neighborhood, on electricity poles, or the ones connected to underground wires, usually transform high voltage of 7,200 volts to 220-240 volts of electricity to power lights and appliances such as refrigerators in homes and businesses. Some countries, such as America use different voltages in homes, such as 120 volts. Transformers cannot increase power, so if the voltage is raised, the current is proportionally lowered. If the voltage is lowered, the current is proportionally increased.\nTransformers inside electronics equipment provide the kinds of electricity the various parts need. \nThere are several basic types of transformers:"}

The capital was Privas alternating with Annonay, Aubenas, Le Bourg(-Saint-And\u00e9ol) and Tournon. In August of that year, the number of districts was reduced to three: M\u00e9zenc, Aubenas and Tanargue. In September, Privas became the only capital of the department.\nIn 1800, with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in France, the three districts were changed into three \"arrondissements\": Privas, L'Argenti\u00e8re and Tournon.\nOn 18 March 1988, Tournon changed its name to Tournon-sur-Rh\u00f4ne.\nGeography.\nThe Ard\u00e8che is part of the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region.

He was a professor of economics and is famous for his work in microcredit. Microcredit is a name for giving small loans. These loans are given to people with very little money. Most banks do not give microcredit. Yunus started the Grameen Bank. In 2006, Yunus and the bank together, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\" Yunus himself has received several other national and international awards. He published a book called \"Banker to the Poor\" and helped start the Grameen Foundation. In 2007 Yunus planned to start a political group called Nagorik Shakti (\"Citizen Power\") in Bangladesh, but he has chosen not to start this group. He is one of the founding members of Global Elders.\nYunus was one of 20 Nobel Laureates such as Peter Agre, Nadine Gordimer, Yuan T. Lee, Elinor Ostrom, Werner Arber, David Gross, James Mirrlees, Carlo Rubbia, Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina, Amartya Sen, Peter Doherty (scientist), Walter Kohn, Douglass North, John Sulston, Murray Gell-Mann, Harold Kroto, Douglas Osheroff who signed the \"Stockholm memorandum\" at the 3rd Nobel Laureate Symposium on Global Sustainability in Stockholm, Sweden on 18 May 2011.\nEarly life.\nMuhammad Yunus born on 28 June 1940. He was the third child born to a Muslim family in the village of Bathua near the Boxirhat Road in Hathazari, Bangladesh (Bangladesh was called British India at that time). Six more children were born in Muhammad's family making nine altogether.\nHis father was Hazi Dula Mia Shoudagar, and worked as a jeweller. His mother was Sofia Khatun. His early childhood years were spent in his village. In 1944, his family moved to the city of Chittagong, and he went to Lamabazar Primary School. By 1949, his mother had a mental illness. Muhammad went to Chittagong Collegiate School and became the 16th best student out of 39,000 in East Pakistan. During his school years, he was a Boy Scout, and travelled to West Pakistan and India in 1952, and to Canada in 1955 to attend Jamborees. When Yunus was studying at Chittagong College, he won awards for drama acting. In 1957, he started studying at the department of economics of Dhaka University. Chittagong College awarded him with a BA in 1960, and a MA in 1961.\nAfter his MA studies, Yunus became part of the Bureau of Economics as a research assistant for Professor Nurul Islam and Rehman Sobhan. In 1961 he was given work as a lecturer in economics in Chittagong College. During that time he started a packaging factory. He was given a Fulbright scholarship in 1965, to study in the United States. He was awarded his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States, in 1969. From 1969 to 1972, Yunus was an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.\nDuring the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, Yunus and other people from Bangladesh living in the United States started a citizens committee and controlled the Bangladesh Information Center to find help for the war. He published the \"Bangladesh Newsletter\" from his home in Nashville. After the War, Yunus returned to Bangladesh and was given a job with the governments' Planning Commission which was controlled by Nurul Islam. He thought the job was boring so he took a job at Chittagong University as Head of the Economics department. He worked with poverty reduction after he saw the Bangladesh famine of 1974, and started a research project to help people who lived in the countryside. In 1975, he started a Nabajug Tebhaga Khamar (new era three share farm) which the government called the Packaged Input Programme. Yunus and his friends started the \"Gram Sarkar\" (the village government) programme to make the farm project better.\nZiaur Rahman,(the president of Bangladesh in the late 1970s), was in control of starting 40,392 village governments (gram sarkar) in 2003. On 2 August 2005, after a petition by the Bangladesh Legal Aids and Services Trust (BLAST) the High Court had declared Gram Sarkar illegal and unconstitutional.\nGrameen Bank.\nIn 1976, Yunus visited the poorest households in the village of Jobra near Chittagong University. He discovered that very small loans could be a lot of help to a poor person. Some Jobra women were making bamboo furniture and had to take loans for buying bamboo but all their profits were being paid towards the loans. The first loan Muhammad Yunus gave was USD 27.00 from his pocket. This $27 was loaned to 42 women in the village, who made a profit of $00.02 each from the loan\nIn December 1976 the government bank Janata Bank gave Yunus a loan that he could use to make lots of small loans to very poor people. His group got more loans from other banks and by 1982, 28,000 people had jobs with Grameen. On 1 October 1983, Grameen was made a full bank and renamed the Grameen Bank (\"Village Bank\") to give loans to poor Bangladeshis. Yunus and his workers were threatened and women were told they would not have a Muslim burial if they borrowed money from the Grameen Bank, but they have given many, many loans to poor people. As of July 2007, Grameen Bank has loaned US$6.38 billion to 7.4 million people. The bank loans money to \"solidarity groups\". These small groups are given loans together and if one person can not pay, the rest of the group pays for them.\nThe Grameen Bank started other groups in the 1980s to do things such as keeping fishing ponds clean and building irrigation pumps. In 1989, these groups started to get their own names. The fisheries project became Grameen Motsho (Grameen Fisheries Foundation) and the irrigation project became Grameen Krishi (Grameen Agriculture Foundation).\nThe Grameen group has grown into many groups of profitable and non-profit, such as the Grameen Trust, the Grameen Fund, Grameen Software Limited, Grameen CyberNet Limited, Grameen Knitwear Limited, Grameen Telecom, and Grameenphone (GP) (Grameenphone is the biggest private sector phone company in Bangladesh). The Village Phone (Polli Phone) project of Grameenphone has made it possible for 260,000 poor people in over 50,000 villages to own mobile phones since March 1997.\nThe Grameen ideas have been used in many countries throughout the world, such as the United States. More than 94% of Grameen loans have been given to women, who have less money and give more to their families. For his work with the Grameen Bank, Yunus was named an Global Academy Member in 2001.\nAwards.\nMuhammad Yunus was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Grameen Bank, for their efforts to create economic and social developments. The Norwegian Nobel Committee said:\nMuhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh, but also in many other countries. Loans to poor people without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty.\nMuhammad Yunus was the first Bangladeshi and third Bengali to ever get a Nobel Prize. After being told of the important award, Yunus said that he would use part of his share of the $1.4 million award money to create a company that makes good food that the poor can afford and the rest would go toward starting an eye hospital for the poor in Bangladesh.\nFormer U.S. president Bill Clinton was one of the people who said the Nobel Prize should go to Muhammed Yunus. He said this in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine and in his autobiography: \"My Life.\" In a speech given at University of California, Berkeley in 2002, President Clinton said Dr. Yunus was \"a man who long ago should have won the Nobel Prize [and] I\u2019ll keep saying that until they finally give it to him.\"\nHe has won many other awards, such as the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the World Food Prize the Sydney Peace Prize, the Four Freedoms Award in the category \"Freemdom from want\" in 2006, and the Ecuadorian Peace Prize in December 2007. Dr. Yunus has been awarded 26 honorary doctorate degrees, and 15 special awards. The Bangladesh government made a postage stamp to honour his Nobel Award. In January 2008, Houston, Texas declared 14 January as \"Muhammad Yunus Day\".\nPolitics.\nIn 2006 Doctor Yunus and other important people, such as Professor Rehman Sobhan, Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman, Doctor Kamal Hossain, Matiur Rahman, Mahfuz Anam and Debapriya Bhattchariya, tried to find good people to be elected for government. Yunus thought about joining government himself that year. On 11 February 2007, Yunus wrote a letter, published in the Bangladeshi newspaper \"Daily Star\", and he asked what people thought of creating a good government. The letter asked everyone to give ideas for this and to offer him help Dr. Yunus started a political group called Citizens' Power (\"Nagorik Shakti\") on 18 February 2007. There was speculation that the army supported a move by Yunus into politics. but on 3 May, Yunus stopped the group after a meeting with Fakhruddin Ahmed (government politician).\nOn 18 July 2007 in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Gra\u00e7a Machel, and Desmond Tutu began a group of world leaders to help the world. Nelson Mandela announced this new group, The Global Elders, in a speech he on his 89th birthday. Archbishop Tutu is to serve as the Chair of The Elders. Yunus is one of the first members of this group. Other members include Machel, Kofi Annan, Ela Bhatt, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter, Li Zhaoxing, and Mary Robinson. The Elders are to be funded by some of its first members, such as Richard Branson, Peter Gabriel, Ray Chambers, Michael Chambers, Bridgeway Foundation, Pam Omidyar, Humanity United, Amy Robbins, Shashi Ruia, Dick Tarlow, and The United Nations Foundation.\nProfessor Yunus Family.\nIn 1967 Yunus studied at Vanderbilt University. He met Vera Forostenko, a student of Russian literature there. Vera is the daughter of Russian immigrants to Trenton, New Jersey in the United States. They were married in 1970. Yunus marriage with Vera ended a few months after the birth of their baby girl, Monica Yunus (b. 1979 Chittagong). Vera returned to New Jersey and said that Bangladesh was not a good place to raise a baby. After some time, Yunus married Afrozi Yunus, who was a researcher in physics at Manchester University. She was appointed as a professor of physics at Jahangirnagar University. Their daughter Deena Afroz Yunus was born in 1986.\nProfessor Yunus brother Muhammad Ibrahim is a professor of physics at Dhaka University and the founder of The Center for Mass Education in Science (CMES). They teach science to girls in villages. His younger brother Muhammad Jahangir is a popular television presenter. Yunus oldest daughter, Monica, is an soprano singer in New York City."}

He is often ranked as one of the five most important poets of the Romantic movement in English literature; the other four are William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Though Keats was the youngest of these poets, he also died before the others: he suffered from tuberculosis and died in Rome at the age of 25.\nKeats was the son of an inn-keeper Thomas Keats, who died when Keats was nine years old and Frances Keats; and his mother died of tuberculosis in 1810. The young Keats began studying to be a surgeon, though his interest in literature grew stronger than his interest in medicine. He became a friend and follower of the poet and editor James Henry Leigh Hunt, and made his first attempts to write his own poetry. Keats's active writing life lasted only about six years, from the spring of 1814 through 1819. \nHis short life meant that he wrote less than many other poets. His longest poems, \"Endymion\" and \"Hyperion\", tell stories from ancient Greek mythology. Many of his shorter poems are among the best known in English literature, including the ballad \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" and his sonnets and odes.\nKeats was an active letter-writer throughout his life, like many people of his time. Hundreds of his letters to friends and relatives have survived, and Keats is often called one of the great letter writers in the English language."}

It is his longest poem. Keats wrote the poem in 1817, and it was printed in a book in 1818. The poem's opening line is one of the most famous lines of poetry in English literature:\nKeats called the poem \"A Poetical Romance.\" He wrote in four sections or \"Books,\" and each section is about a thousand lines long. The poem is written in a form called rhymed couplets, which means that every two lines rhyme together. The story is based on the tale of Endymion from Greek mythology.\n\"Endymion\" was criticized harshly when it was first published. Some of Keats's friends and admirers, like the poet Shelley, believed that the stress of this hostile reaction had a bad effect on Keats's mind, and partly caused his early death from tuberculosis at the age of 25. But most modern critics and scholars of English literature do not think this is true."}

He finished the first two sections or \"Books,\" each between 350 and 400 lines long, and he also wrote 135 lines of Book III. But he was not satisfied with what he had written; he re-wrote it bit by bit until April 1819, when he gave up for a while. Some critics and scholars think that Keats set out to write the kind of long poem he had already done in his \"Endymion\" in 1817 \u2013 but his outlook on poetry had changed, to a point where he was no longer happy writing the kind of mythological epic that many other poets of his time tried to write.\nKeats tried to re-do the poem in a new form that he called \"The Fall of Hyperion\". He worked on this second version during the last six months of 1819, and though he wrote more than 500 lines, he gave up this second attempt too. He was never able to complete either version of the poem in a way that satisfied him.\nKeats wrote the poem in blank verse, without rhyme. Though neither version was ever finished, some critics think that they contain some of Keats's best verse, as in the gloomy and powerful opening lines of the first \"Hyperion\":\n[\"vale\" = valley; \"morn\" = morning; \"eve\" = evening]"}

His most famous song is Alice's Restaurant, which was also the title of his first album.\nEarly life.\nGuthrie learned music from his father, who wrote songs for him like \"Goodnight Little Arlo\". When the young Guthrie became thirteen years old, his father gave him a Bar Mitzvah, and invited many folk musicians. It was called \"the first hootenanny bar mitzvah in history.\"\nGuthrie met Bob Dylan when Dylan came from Minnesota to meet his father Woody. Dylan taught Guthrie a new way to play the harmonica. Guthrie started college after high school, but dropped out.\n\"Alice's Restaurant\".\nDuring 1965, Guthrie visited his friends Alice and Ray Brock in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, who lived in an old church, and owned a restaurant. He recorded a musical commercial for the restaurant. When Thanksgiving came that year, they invited many people, and afterwards there was a lot of garbage to be picked up and thrown away. Guthrie and another friend tried to take the garbage to a dump, but it was closed. They found a large trash pile not far away, and unwisely decided to throw their garbage onto the same pile. (Dumping trash where it does not belong is called 'littering' and is a crime in most places.)\nWhen local police found out, they arrested Guthrie and his friend. Since the young men had long hair and looked like hippies, the police wanted to prosecute them and make an example of them to other young people. They prepared a big court case against Guthrie and his friend, with many photographs of the litter pile. It turned out the local judge was blind, could not look at the photographs, and was not interested in the case. He fined Guthrie and his friend fifty dollars, and ordered them to clean up the pile.\nNot long after, Guthrie received a draft notice. The United States Army wanted him to become a soldier. Guthrie went for a physical examination by a doctor, and had to fill out a questionnaire giving information about himself. When asked if he had ever been arrested, he talked about the littering incident. He soon found himself sitting on a bench together with criminals, some of which were violent or dangerous. He could not believe the way he was treated by the Army. He began to complain and protest his treatment. The Army officers decided he would not make a good soldier, but might become a threat to the American government. They fingerprinted Guthrie, and let him go.\nGuthrie decided later the two incidents would make a good protest song and he built one around the jingle he had written. He called the song \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree\", and recorded it in front of a live audience. He did not want other young men to be drafted, and suggested in the song that they might get out of the draft by doing like he had.\nThe recording became half of his first album, and the rest was filled out with other music, like \"The Motorcycle Song\". The album became a hit record.\nLater career.\nGuthrie later recorded other albums and songs. His cover of the Steve Goodman song, \"The City of New Orleans\", about a famous train named after the city, became another hit. He bought a farm with the money he earned from his music, and lived there between recording sessions and performing tours.\nIn time, he became interested in charity work. He noticed people of different religious beliefs did not always work well together for the same causes, because their beliefs kept them apart. He tried to work around the differences, and help people find ways to work together to solve the same problems. He started the Guthrie Center, as a place for people to work together. He later bought the old church where his friends had lived, and made it the headquarters for the Guthrie Center."}

It is 14 lines long and is written in rhyme. \nThe sonnet first appeared in Italy during the Middle Ages and was widely used during the Renaissance. The first poet known for his sonnets is Giacomo da Lentini who lived in the 13th century. After him many poets started writing sonnets. Two notable ones are Dante Alighieri and Guido Cavalcanti. The Italian poet Petrarch was famous for his sonnets. He was very popular and many poets imitated his poems. Francisco de S\u00e1 de Miranda introduced the form into Portuguese literature. So did Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in England. Even in distant Poland sonnets were written by Jan Kochanowski, Miko\u0142aj S\u0119p Szarzy\u0144ski and Sebastian Grabowiecki. It became common for poets to write sonnets in connected series, called \"sonnet sequences,\" to tell a story, often one about a love affair. Michelangelo, a famous sculptor and painter wrote sonnets, too. He exchanged them with Vittoria Colonna. Poets in other countries quickly adopted the sonnet and sonnet sequence. William Shakespeare wrote the most famous sonnets in English literature, though other poets of his time, such as Ben Jonson, Edmund Spenser, Michael Drayton, and Samuel Daniel, wrote sonnet sequences also.\nLater English poets like John Donne, John Milton, William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats wrote sonnets that are still admired and studied today. In United States Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Emma Lazarus wrote sonnets. \nThe rigid rhyme scheme of the sonnet went out of fashion during the twentieth century, but a few modern poets still write them sometimes. Edna St. Vincent Millay was one modern poet writing in English who often worked in the sonnet form. Modern poets have often changed the traditional rhythms and rhyme patterns of the sonnet, sometimes radically.\nIn a traditional \"English\" or \"Shakespearean\" sonnet, the first twelve lines are divided into three groups (\"stanzas\") of four lines each, called \"quatrains\". The last two lines usually rhyme, and make up a \"rhymed couplet\" that concludes the poem by summing up the story told in the previous quatrains. In the traditional \"Italian\" or \"Petrarchan\" sonnet, the poem divides into a group of eight lines (\"octave\") followed by a group of six lines (\"sestet\").\nThe letters of the alphabet are used to show the pattern of rhyme, or \"rhyme scheme,\" in the 14 lines in a sonnet. The rhyme scheme \nis the typical pattern of an \"English\" sonnet. The rhyme scheme\nis typical of an \"Italian\" sonnet. However, the rhymes of the sestet in an Italian sonnet can vary widely: cdcdcd, cddcdd, etc. The scheme abba abba cde edc is very rarely, but its ending sequence cde edc was probably the source for Robert Browning's stanza abccba. It was used in the poem \"Meeting at night\". Another pattern is Spenserian sonnet, invented by Edmund Spenser. It runs a-b-a-b, b-c-b-c, c-d-c-d, e-e.\nSonnets can be linked together into a crown of sonnets. In such a sequence, the last line of the first sonnet repeats as the first line of the second one, and sometimes these lines make up another sonnet. Slovenian poet France Pre\u0161eren is best remembered for his \"Wreath of Sonnets\", an example of a crown of sonnets."}

Their ratio is \"a\"/\"b\". Another ratio is found by adding the two numbers together and dividing this by the larger number \"a\". The new ratio is (\"a\"+\"b\")/\"a\". If these two ratios are equal to the same number, then that number is called the golden ratio. The Greek letter formula_1 (phi) is usually used as the name for the golden ratio.\nFor example, if \"b\" = 1 and \"a\"/\"b\" = formula_1, then \"a\" = formula_1. The second ratio (\"a\"+\"b\")/\"a\" is then formula_4. Because these two ratios are equal, this is true:\nformula_5\nOne way to write this number is\nformula_6\nformula_7 is a number which, when multiplied by itself, makes 5: formula_8.\nThe golden ratio is an irrational number. That means that if a person tries to write it, it will never stop and never make a pattern, but it will start like this: 1.6180339887... An important thing about this number is that if you subtract 1 from it or divide 1 by it, you'll get the same number.\nGolden rectangle.\nIf the length of a rectangle divided by its width is equal to the golden ratio, then the rectangle is a \"golden rectangle\". If a square is cut off from one end of a golden rectangle, then the other end is a new golden rectangle. In the picture, the big rectangle (blue and pink together) is a golden rectangle because formula_10. The blue part (B) is a square, and the pink part by itself (A) is another golden rectangle because formula_11. The big rectangle and the pink rectangle have the same form, but the pink rectangle is smaller and is turned.\nFibonacci numbers.\nThe Fibonacci numbers are a list of numbers. A person can find the next number in the list by adding the last two numbers together.

The database matches data by using identical information that is found within the data set. The resulting groups of data are organized and are much easier for many people to understand.\nFor example, a database has all information about real-estate sales in a town. This information can be grouped by year, or by sale price, or by buyer's last name and so on. Such a grouping uses the relational model (a technical term for this is schema). Hence, such a database is called a \"relational database.\"\nThe software used to do this grouping is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). The term \"relational database\" often refers to this type of software.\nRelational databases are currently the main way in which companies store information like financial records, medical records, personal information and manufacturing and logistical data.\nThe term \"relational database\" was originally defined by and is attributed to Edgar Codd at IBM Almaden Research Center in 1970.\nReferences.\nRDBMS(Relational Database Management System):- RDBMS is a software package used to store and retrieve data is organized in the form of tables. In other words RDBMS store information in rows and columns and conducts searches by using data in specified columns and rows of one tables as well as to find additional data in another related table.\nTwo dimensional table is a natural way to represent data to a user. A table must be set up in a way that no information about the relations among data elements is lost."}

{"id": "101931", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101931", "title": "Relation (mathematics)", "text": "In mathematics, an \"n-ary relation\" on \"n\" sets, is any subset of Cartesian product of the \"n\" sets (i.e., a collection of n-tuples), with the most common one being a binary relation, a collection of order pairs from two sets containing an object from each set. The relation is \"homogeneous\" when it is formed with one set.\nFor example, any curve in the Cartesian plane is a subset of the Cartesian product of real numbers, \"RxR\".\nThe homogeneous binary relations are studied for properties like reflexiveness, symmetry, and transitivity, which determine different kinds of orderings on the set. Heterogeneous \"n-ary\" relations are used in the semantics of predicate calculus, and in relational databases.\nIn relational databases jargon, the relations are called tables.\nThere is a relational algebra consisting in the operations on sets, because relations are sets, extended with operators like projection, which forms a new relation selecting a subset of the columns (tuple entries) in a table, the selection operator, which selects just the rows (tuples),according to some condition, and join which works like a composition operator.\nThe use of the term \"relation\" is often used as shorthand to refer to binary relations, where the set of all the starting points is called the \"domain\" and the set of the ending points is the \"codomain\".\nDifferent types of relationship.\nAn example for such a relation might be a function. Functions associate each key with one value. The set of all functions is a subset of the set of all relations - a function is a relation where the first value of every tuple is unique through the set.\nOther well-known relations are the equivalence relation and the order relation. That way, sets of things can be ordered: Take the first element of a set, it is either equal to the element looked for, or there is an order relation that can be used to classify it. That way, the whole set can be classified (i.e., compared to some arbitrarily chosen element).\nRelations can be transitive.One example of a transitive relation is the \"smaller-than\" relation. If X \"is smaller than\" Y,and Y is \"smaller than\" Z,then X \"is smaller than\" Z. In general, a transitive relation is a relation such that if relations (a,b) and (b,c) both belong to R, then (a,c) must also belongs to R. \nRelations can be symmetric. One example of a symmetric relation is the relation \"is equal to\". If X \"is equal to\" Y, then Y \"is equal to\" X. In general, a symmetric relation is a relation such that if (a,b) belongs to R, then (b,a) must belong to R as well.\nRelations can be asymmetric, such as the relation \" is smaller than\". In general, a relation is asymmetric if whether (a,b) belongs to R, (b,a) does not belong to R.\nRelations can be reflexive. One example of a reflexive relation is the relation \"is equal to\" (e.g., for all X, X \"is equal to\" X). In general, a reflexive relation is a relation such that for all a in A, (a,a) belongs to R.\nBy definition, every subset of AxB is a relation from A to B.\nIn category theory, relations play an important role in the Cartesian closed categories, which transform morphisms from tuples to morphisms of single elements. That corresponds to Currying in the Lambda calculus.\nDatabases and Relations.\nIn the relational database theory, a database is a set of relations.\nTo model a real world, the relations should be in a canonical form called normalized form in the data base argot.\nThat transformation ensure no loss of information, nor the insertion of spurious tuples with no corresponding meaning in the world represented in the database. The normalization process takes into account properties of relations like functional dependencies among their entries, keys and foreign keys, transitive and join dependencies."}

The 1907 Dominican Constitution change its status to province. It was part of the old province of Santo Domingo and of the El Seibo province before being elevated to the category of province with the municipalities of Macor\u00eds (later, San Pedro de Macor\u00eds), Ram\u00f3n Santana and San Jos\u00e9 de Los Llanos.\nConsuelo was made a municipality in 1996, Quisqueya in 1998 and Guayacanes in 1992.

He was the quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals. After playing in college at Northern Iowa, he was signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent. He was not able to play there, so he went to the Arena Football League, and then later the NFL Europa.\nIn 1998, Warner was signed by the St. Louis Rams. After the Rams\u2019 main quarterback Trent Green went out with an injury, Warner became the main quarterback. He later went on to win NFL MVP awards in 1999 and 2001, as well as the Super Bowl MVP award in 2000.\nIn 1990, Kurt graduated from Regis High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. While there, he played quarterback of the school's Class 3A football team. He announced his retirement from football on January 29, 2010.\nCollege days and marriage.\nAfter Warner graduated from high school, he went to the University of Northern Iowa (UNI). At UNI, Warner was third on the Panthers' depth chart until his senior year. In his final year there, he was able to start and was named the Gateway Conference's Offensive Player of the Year.\nWhile at college, he met future wife, the former Brenda Carney Meoni. They got married on October 11, 1997. Before this, Brenda had served in the Marines. She was divorced with two children when they met each other. Warner adopted Brenda's two children, son Zachary and daughter Jesse, after their marriage. Zachary is blind from the head injuries he got when he was accidentally dropped by his birth-father as a baby. Warner agreed to help Brenda raise the children. The Warners now also have five children of their own: sons Elijah and Kade, daughter Jada, and twin girls Sierra Rose and Sienna Rae.\nAfter being let go from the Green Bay Packers training camp in 1994, he got a job working the night shift at a local Fareway grocery store. He was also assistant-coaching at Northern Iowa. Warner still wanted to play in the NFL, but with that not seeming it was going to happen, and the long hours at the Fareway for minimum wage creating financial trouble for him, Warner began playing in the Arena Football League. In 1996 and almost a year before Kurt and Brenda's marriage, Brenda's parents, Larry and Jenny Carney, were killed when their Arkansas home was destroyed by a tornado.\nChristianity.\nBoth Kurt and his wife are active born again Christians.\nEmbryonic stem cell advertisement.\nOn October 24, 2006, Warner was in a political advertisement against a proposed law in Missouri. That new law would allow embryonic stem cell research to be done in Missouri. Warner was in the advertisement with James Caviezel, Patricia Heaton, Jeff Suppan, and Mike Sweeney. The advertisement, which was played during Game 4 of the 2006 World Series, falsely alleged that Amendment 2 would allow human cloning. The advertisement came after a pro-embryonic research advertisement that had Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, in it.\nArena Football and NFL Europe.\nWarner went to the Green Bay Packers training camp in 1994, but was released before the regular season began. He returned to Northern Iowa and worked as a graduate assistant coach with the football team but he still wanted to get a tryout with an NFL team. When no NFL team would give him a tryout, Warner began playing for the Arena Football League. In 1995, he signed with the Iowa Barnstormers. Warner was named to the AFL's All-Arena first team in both 1996 and 1997. He led the Barnstormers to the Arena Bowl in both 1996 and 1997. Some people consider Warner one of the greatest Arena Football player of all-time.\nIn 1997, Warner was offered an NFL tryout by the Chicago Bears, but he could not attend the tryout. In 1998, he was signed by the St. Louis Rams, but he only played for NFL Europe's Amsterdam Admirals.\nNational Football League career.\nSt. Louis Rams.\n1999 season.\nWarner was the backup quarterback for the St. Louis Rams during the 1998 regular season and the 1999 preseason. When their main quarterback Trent Green was injured in a preseason game, Warner became the starter. He had one of the best seasons by a quarterback in NFL history by throwing for 4,353 yards with 41 touchdown passes and a completion rate of 65.1%. The Rams' very good offense was nicknamed \"The Greatest Show on Turf.\" In the first three games that he was the main quarterback who plays, he threw three touchdown passes in each game. He is the only NFL quarterback in history to do that, and only the second, behind Dan Marino, to do it in his first two NFL starts.\nBecause not many people knew who Warner was, \"Sports Illustrated\" put him on their October 18, 1999 cover with the caption \"Who IS this guy?\" He was named the 1999 NFL MVP at the end of the season. In the NFL playoffs, he led the Rams to a Super Bowl XXXIV win against the Tennessee Titans. He threw for two touchdowns and a Super Bowl record 414 passing yards. He also set a Super Bowl record by throwing 45 passes without an interception.\nRight after the Rams' Super Bowl win, an interviewer asked Warner, \"Kurt, first things first--tell me about the final touchdown pass to Isaac.\" He responded, \"Well, first things first, I've got to thank my Lord and Savior up above--thank You, Jesus!\" He was awarded the Super Bowl MVP. That made him one of only six players to win both the league MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards in the same year. The others are Bart Starr in 1966, Terry Bradshaw in 1978, Joe Montana in 1989, Emmitt Smith in 1993, and Steve Young in 1994.\n2000 season.\nWarner also played well in the 2000 season. Warner and Trent Green both played quarterback that season, and they both played well. But the Rams lost in the wild card round of the playoffs to the New Orleans Saints, mostly because their defense was not very good, even though Warner and the rest of their offense was still very good. Nine of the Rams' eleven defensive starters were cut in the offseason, and Green was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n2001 season.\nWarner played very well in the 2001 season. He had a league-high 36 touchdown passes and 4,830 passing yards with a career-high completion rate of 68.7% of his passes. He led the Rams to an NFL-best 14\u20132 record and they went to the Super Bowl XXXVI, but they lost to the New England Patriots. He was named the NFL MVP for the second time at the end of the season.\n2002 and 2003 seasons.\nWarner began the season 0\u20133 as a starter, throwing seven interceptions with only one touchdown. In their fourth game against the Dallas Cowboys, he broke a finger on his throwing hand. Even thought he tried to come back later in the season, his injury caused him to be able to play two more games, and he lost them both. In contrast to his 103.4 career passer rating before that season, he had only 67.4 rating in 2002. He was replaced as the Rams' main quarterback after he fumbled six times in the opener of the 2003 season against the New York Giants. His replacement as the Rams quarterback, Marc Bulger, has been named to two Pro Bowls.\nNew York Giants.\nThe Rams released Warner on June 1, 2004. Just two days later, he signed a two-year deal with the New York Giants. He began the 2004 season as the main quarterback. He won five of his first seven games, but after not playing well in a two-game losing streak, rookie quarterback Eli Manning was made the main quarterback. Giants coach Tom Coughlin later said that he never should have made Warner play, and should have played Manning from the beginning to give Manning the experience he needs to build his confidence. The Giants had a 5\u20134 win-loss record at the time that Manning began playing, and they finished at 6\u201310 overall (going only 1\u20136 under Manning).\nArizona Cardinals.\n2005 season.\nIn early 2005, Warner signed a one-year, $4-million contract with the Arizona Cardinals. He was soon named the main quarterback by coach Dennis Green. He played bad in three games before injuring his groin. He was then replaced by former starter Josh McCown. McCown played well enough in two games during Warner's injury to get coach Green named McCown the starter for the rest of the season.\nAs Warner was the backup quarterback, many people thought that he was never to be the main quarterback again. But because McCown played bad in two straight games, coach Green made Warner the main quarterback. He played well in the next three weeks, but his season ended in Week 15 when he partly tore his MCL.\n2006 season.\nWarner signed a new three-year deal with the Cardinals on February 14, 2006. The deal had a base salary of $18 million, but if he played well, he could get as much as $22 million in the three years.\nIn Week 3 of the 2006 season, Warner passed the 20,000-yards passing milestone in his 76th game. That was one game more than record holder Dan Marino, but Warner did it in his 9th year while Marino did it in his 5th. After Matt Leinart played poorly in the three games of Weeks 2-4, Warner replaced the rookie Leinart in the fourth quarter of Week 4. In Week 16, Leinart had a shoulder injury against the San Francisco 49ers, so Warner was able to play for the first time since Week 4. He did well that game, and the Cardinals won the game.\n2007 season.\nIn the third game of the 2007 season against the Baltimore Ravens, Warner came off the bench because Leinart was again not playing well. He led a comeback, completing 15 passes out of 20 attempts for 258 yards and 2 touchdowns. This brought them to a tie game (23\u201323), but after the Ravens made a last second field goal, Arizona lost the game 26\u201323. On September 30, 2007, during the Week 4 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he went in for Leinart because he was not playing well again. Leinart was later placed on Injured reserve, so Warner was named the starter for the rest of the 2007 season.\nWarner got 27 passing touchdowns in the 2007 season, just one short of the Cardinals franchise record. Because he played well, he was given a $1 million bonus for the year. His 3,417 passing yards, 27 touchdown passes, and 89.8 passer rating were all his best since the 2001 season.\n2008 season/playoffs.\nMatt Leinart was named the Cardinals starter going in to the off-season for 2008, but Ken Whisenhunt said that it may happen that Warner become the Cardinals' starter before the season begins. Warner was named the starter on August 30, 2008. That season, Warner had a very good season, and on December 16, 2008, was named the starting quarterback for the NFC team in the 2009 Pro Bowl. Warner and the Cardinals won all three of their playoff games, but lost in the Super Bowl to the Pittsburgh Steelers. That makes Warner's Super Bowl record 1\u20132. James Dobson, starter of Focus on the Family, has been supportive of Warner, and even replayed a radio clip of Warner and his wife on January 30, 2009."}

Frank Baum", "text": "Lyman Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 \u2013 May 6, 1919) was an American writer of children's books during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is best known for his most famous and popular book, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" (1900), and other \"Oz\" books that followed it.\nEarly life.\nBaum was born in a small town in Chittenango, New York. He was a member of a large family. He started writing as a child. When his father bought his children a simple printing press, Baum and a younger brother wrote and printed a small local newspaper. As a young man, Baum wrote and staged plays. Sometimes he wrote songs for his plays and starred in them himself. He also tried many other careers. He was a travelling salesman and a storekeeper for a time. He started a newspaper while he lived in a town in South Dakota. He married in 1882. He and his wife, Maud Gage Baum, raised four sons. Baum had a very good imagination. He liked creating stories for his young sons and their friends.\nWriting career.\nWhen he became 40 years old and was living in Chicago, Baum started writing children's books. These books were often based on the stories he had told to children over many years. After several successes in the late 1890s, Baum published what he called an \"American fairy tale,\" \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", in 1900. The book had pictures drawn by the American artist W. W. Denslow. Baum had to pay for the first \"Oz\" book himself. No Chicago publisher wanted to publish \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". One man even told Baum that if people had wanted to read this kind of book, it would already have been written. \nBut the first \"Oz\" book was a big success. Baum was able to give up other business ideas and make enough money to live on by writing children's books. The children who read his books often wrote to Baum, and asked him to write more about \"Oz\". This caused Baum to begin a series of books set in the fantasy land of Oz. In time, Baum grew tired of the series. He tried to end it but his child readers kept demanding that he continue. Baum met their demands through the rest of his life. He wrote 14 \"Oz\" books in all. The last two were printed after his death in 1919.\nBaum also wrote a large number of books other than the \"Oz\" series. He was proudest of his fantasies for children, but he also wrote many other kinds of popular works. He used many pen names for these works.\nBaum's children's books were illustrated with pictures by different artists. After the first \"Oz\" book, all the rest in the series had pictures by John R. Neill.\nLater life.\nBaum made a good income from his books. He spent time travelling around the world with his wife. They settled in Hollywood, California, and Baum made movie versions of some of his \"Oz\" books. He also produced stage versions of them. But his businesses were not always successful. In time, Baum had to declare bankruptcy. He was smart enough to put his house in his wife's name, so that they did not lose their home in the bankruptcy."}

The book tells the story of the Prophet Jonah, who was called by God to go to the heathen city of Nineveh, which God would soon destroy if they did not repent. Nineveh was the main city of the Assyrians who were the enemies of Jonah's country of Israel. So instead, Jonah ran away from God and went in a ship towards the west. God sent a great storm and the ship was about to sink. God showed the sailors that Jonah was to blame, and although they didn't want to, they threw him out of the ship and the storm stopped. Jonah was swallowed by a great fish (probably a whale). He repented of his sin of running away from God. Then he prayed for three days and nights. God made the great fish spit Jonah onto the dry land. Then he obeyed God and went to tell the people of their sins to God.\nJonah then went all through the city telling everyone that God was going to punish them. Their hearts were changed and they saw their evildoing. They prayed for God to deliver them from the upcoming destruction to their city. God saw their change and had mercy on them, but Jonah still did not believe it. He went to wait upon a high up rock and see God's anger against the city. God was not pleased with that so he first made a plant grow, and then sent a small worm to bite down the small gourd plant, which was Jonah's only shade from the heat of the sun. Jonah was very angry and said it was better for him to die than live. God, in turn, said that Jonah cared more about the little plant than all the people of Nineveh! "}

The book is made up of four chapters and a total of fifty-five verses. The word Malachi means \"my messenger\". It is unknown if this is a name or if it describes the work of the writer. There are very few historical details in the Book of Malachi. The best clue as to its dating may be the Persian term for governor (peh\u00e2) is used in Chapter 1 verse 8. This could mean that it was written after the time when the Jews were in Persia. in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515 BC. The author of Ecclesiasticus early in the 2nd century BC used some of the themes in the book of Malachi, so most scholars assign it to a position after Haggai and Zechariah, close to the time of Ezra and when Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445 BC. Since the book talks about things that are common in religion, it could have been given at most any time. This leaves some doubt about the date.\nThe Book Of Malachi uses a method of \"question and answer\". God says something and the people ask how that can be true. Then God gives the reason for what He has said. Then the next statement, question and answer follow. The questions include:\n\"Does God love us\"? and \"Why is God angry with us\"? God gives a list of wrong things they have done. They have made offerings of second rate things in the temple. Priests have not done their work properly. Men have married women who were not followers of God. They have not been faithful to the wives they have married. They have questioned God's justice and they have not given the tithe to the temple.\nThe book ends by telling everyone to obey the laws given by Moses and by saying that Elijah will return before the end of time.\nQuotes from the Book of Malachi:\nChapter 3, verses 1-3 form part of the text of Handel's Messiah, a famous musical work.\nChapter 3, verse 1 is quoted by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew Chapter 11, verse 10, and said to be about John the Baptist.\nChapter 4, verse 6 is included in a promise given to the father of John the Baptist in the Gospel of Luke Chapter 1 verse 17\nChapter 3, verse 8 has been quoted by many famous preachers to tell people that they should have given money to God and to help other people."}

Although it was eventually released in theatres in 25 countries, in the United States and some other countries it was a direct-to-video release (released on February 7, 2006). Taking place in the middle of \"Bambi\" during the title character\u2019s adolescence, it shows the Great Prince of the Forest struggling to raise the motherless Bambi, and Bambi's doubts about his father's love.\nThe Story.\nPicking up shortly after his mother's death, Bambi follows his father, the Great Prince, into the forest. With the help of Thumper and Flower, Bambi must win his father's approval, but the Great Prince finds that his high-spirited son may have a lesson or two to teach him as well.\nProduction.\nMany of the backgrounds used in the movie are exactly the same that were used in the original 1942 movie. The old backgrounds were put through the computer to create a clearer image.\nRelease.\nThe movie was released on home video at differing dates, due to it being a theatrical release in some countries. While the movie was a direct-to-video release in countries like the United States, Japan, Canada, mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, it was a theatrical release in some countries like the United Kingdom, France, Austria, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Australia and some other European countries. It broke the world record for the longest amount of time between two related movies made in a series, being released 63 and a half years after the first movie. As major studios continue to phase out VHS, this was the last Disney animated movie released on VHS. Following its moratorium strategy, in which releases are made available for a limited time only, Disney gave the DVD a 70-day window for its US release. The movie sold 2.6 million DVDs in its first week in the United States.\nReception.\nThe movie generally received a positive rating from professional critics. It holds a score of 60% \"Fresh\" in Rotten Tomatoes and has a rating of 6.3 stars out of 10 in IMDb. It was praised for its animation - regarded as some of the best among the Disney direct-to-video sequels - but the story was thought to be lacking and easy to make. Movie fans were much more positive, according to ratings on Amazon.com.\nSoundtrack.\n\"Bambi II\"'s musical score includes instrumental pieces by Bruce Broughton, and new vocal songs by several noted artists, including Alison Krauss, Martina McBride, and Anthony Callea. Coinciding the with film's DVD release, the soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records in the United States on February 7, 2006. Produced by Matt Walker, the CD included 9 songs from the movie, as well as three tracks from the original movie.\nTime period changes.\nIn the original book on which \"Bambi\" was based, Ronno was already a stag when Bambi was born, instead of being mere weeks-to-months older than he was as in the movie. An additional twist is that in the book, Ronno was quite respectable (though a bit of a whiner as he is portrayed in the movie), and there was nothing at all personal about his rivalry with Bambi over Faline. Ronno's character is never named in the original movie. However, documentation from Disney clearly indicates that the Ronno in Bambi II is the same deer which Bambi fought in the original, right down to the same moves each deer makes during their fight in the sequel. The age of the Great Prince changes as compared to the original movie. In the original, the Great Prince is said to be twice as old as the oldest deer. In this movie, the Great Prince is said to have been the same age as Bambi's mother.\nDouble-Takes.\nThere are several scenes in \"Bambi II\" which are noticeably similar to scenes from the first movie, \"Bambi\". For example:\nThird sequel.\nIn 2007, Pimental expressed interest of making a third movie, which was supposed to continue were the original left off. The movie was originally meant to be released direct-to-DVD in the U.S and in European theaters in late 2011. However, since DisneyToon Studios was shut down."}

In humans, the jaws are two bones in the mouth, the mandible (lower jaw) and maxilla (upper jaw), that let the teeth move up and down in order to chew. The mandible is joined to the skull.\nHowever, in insects, the jaws may open left and right instead, and they are usually outside the mouth instead of inside it. Sea urchins have five jaws with one tooth each. Some animals, even some vertebrates, do not have jaws.\nA body part is called a jaw based on what it does, not what it is made of or how it grows. In different animals, it can be made of different kinds of cells and tissue. In the embryos of different animals, it may come from different original places. Even within arthropods, the group that contains insects and lobsters and trilobites and spiders, the jaws of different animals may grow from different original tissues, even though they end up looking similar in adult animals. A pair of appendages that become jaws in one species may become antennae in a different species or legs in another. Moray eels and some other fish have two sets of jaws. The outer jaws in their faces grow from the same tissues as the jaws of other fish, and the inner jaws, called pharyngeal jaws, can come from the same tissue that becomes gills or muscles in other fish.\nMarsupials and monotremes are born before their jaws have grown enough for them to drink their mothers' milk the way other baby mammals do. Scientists from Kings' College London found that opossums and other marsupials use tissue from their inner ear to make a temporary jaw so they can feed and grow. They found that baby echidnas also form a temporary jaw using the bones of their inner ear so they can feed and grow."}

Walker was an American soldier who believed slavery was good. He told the people of Nicaragua that he wanted to help the country. What he really wanted was to conquer the five free nations of Central America. The president of Costa Rica, Juan Rafael Mora Porras thought that Walker wanted to conquer them.

At four o\u2019clock, the Costa Rican battalions began the attack against the invaders. After fourteen minutes, the Costa Rican forces won the battle.

Picado may have been the first to have learned about penicillin.\nEarly life and education.\nPicado was born in San Marcos, Nicaragua but moved, with his parents, to Costa Rica in 1890. In 1908, Picado won a scholarship of the Costa Rican Congress to study in Paris, France.\nIn 1913, he finished his university studies in La Sorbonne, where he earned his BSc in zoology and botany, as well as a doctorate degree. In the same year, he came back to Costa Rica to run the laboratory of San Juan de Dios Hospital. At the same time, he was teaching sciences at San Luis G\u00f3nzaga School in Cartago city.\nDiscoveries.\nSir Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist, is commonly said to be the person who learned about the antibacterial attacks of a fungus known as \"Penicillium notatum\" in 1928. But in March 2000, Costa Rican doctors showed some notebooks with research belonging to Picado. In these notebooks, he explained his experiments between 1915 and 1927. These experiments had been developed to explain that Penicillium decreased bacterial activity.\nPicado had reported his work to the Paris Academy of Sciences in France, but this academy did not patent it, even though Picado had studied the fungus years before Fleming.\nPicado studied the creation of various anti-venom serums. This led to the create of the Instituto Clodomiro Picado in 1970. It is a research unit of the University of Costa Rica The unit is works on research in Toxicology, Herpetology and Immunology. It also deals with the production of anti-venom. It was named for him in honor of his life\u2019s work."}

This book is thought to have been written by the Apostle Paul to the people of Ephesus while he was imprisoned in Rome, around 62 A.D. However, the words \"in Ephesus\" do not appear in the best and earliest hand copies of the letter, leading most textual critics, like Bart Ehrman, to regard the words \"in Ephesus\" as a later addition. Copies of the letter may have been sent to other churches also, since it contains no personal references to people at Ephesus.\nThe Church at Ephesus.\nPaul's first short visit of three months to Ephesus is recorded in Acts Chapter 18, verses 19\u201321. The work he began then was continued by Apollos (Acts Chapter 18 verses 24\u201326) and Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit early in the next year, he stayed at Ephesus \"three years\", and from there visited the western parts of Asia Minor. From Ephesus the gospel spread abroad \"almost throughout all Asia Minor.\"\nOn his last journey to Jerusalem, the apostle landed at Miletus and, called together the leaders of the church from Ephesus, and said \"good bye\" to them expecting to see them no more. (Acts Chapter 20, verses 18\u201335)\nContent of the letter.\nFrank Charles Thompson, says that the main theme of Ephesians is to tell the newly converted Jews not to separate themselves from their Gentile fellow Christians. The unity of the church, especially between Jew and Gentile believers, is the main thing in the book. The purpose of the epistle, and to whom it was written, are matters of much speculation. It was regarded by C.H. Dodd as the \"crown of Paulinism.\" meaning the most important part of Paul's teachings.\nThe author strongly tells the church again and again to have a certain view of salvation, which he then explains. Chapter 2, verse 6, states \"By grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works so that no one should boast\"\nIn Chapter 6 Paul tells about how families should treat each other. He says that children should love their parents, fathers should not make their children angry, servants should serve their masters, and masters should not threaten their servants, since God does not favor any group above another.\nThe ending of the letter mentions truth, peace, salvation and prayer as \"armor of God\". that will enable the Christians to stand firm."}

Together with his friend William Wordsworth, Coleridge is often said to have started the Romantic movement in English literature. He was also a literary critic, philosopher and theologian. \nColeridge was born in Ottery St Mary, Devon. He was the son of a minister, and the youngest of ten children. He attended the University of Cambridge, Jesus College, though he never earned his degree. He met Wordsworth, another young poet, in 1795. They became close friends, and in 1798 they published their poems in a book called \"Lyrical Ballads\", which many critics consider a key event in English Romanticism. Most of the poems in the book were written by Wordsworth, though it also contained Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", which many people call his masterpiece and one of the great poems in English. (In it, Coleridge used old-fashioned spellings, like \"rime\" for \"rhyme,\" to give the poem an antique feeling.)\nIn 1796, Coleridge wrote his poem \"Kubla Khan\" \u2014 along with the \"Ancient Mariner\", it is his best-known work. At about the same time, in the later 1790s, Coleridge became addicted to opium. At that time the drug was legal, and was widely used as a painkiller. Coleridge's addiction to opium marked the rest of his life. His health suffered, and he had trouble supporting his wife and children. He also had a hard time finishing the writing projects he started.\nColeridge had a reputation as a great talker, and people often invited him to their dinner parties to hear him speak. He was a successful lecturer at times in his later life. He gained a reputation as a thinker and philosopher as well as a poet. He died in Highgate, Middlesex.\nScholars and critics of English literature have regarded Coleridge as a major figure. In his 1927 book \"The Road to Xanadu\", John Livingston Lowes used Coleridge's poetry, especially \"Kubla Khan\", to study the working of the human imagination. Critics have argued about the role that opium addiction played in the poet's life and work. In his 1971 book \"Coleridge, the Damaged Archangel\", Norman Furman showed that Coleridge was guilty of plagiarism in many of his later works. His opium addiction may have left Coleridge unable to tell when he was repeating the work of other writers that he had read."}

It is also the movie's title song, and the name of its soundtrack recording.\nShow.\nPaul McCartney had the original idea for \"Magical Mystery Tour\", coming back from the Monterey Pop Festival in California, during the summer of 1967. He drew a clock face on a paper plate, and filled it with parts of the show he imagined. McCartney based the idea on Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, who travelled the United States in a bus, and also \"\", which were low-budget weekend vacation trips taken in England.\nThe other Beatles liked the idea for the show, and made plans to produce and direct it themselves. After they stopped giving concerts in 1966, they had started making their own promotional films (called \"promos\"), much like today's music videos. They had success with promos, and wanted to try making a whole programme, to appear on television during the Christmas holidays.\nBeatles manager Brian Epstein helped set up the production, and the Beatles asked friends, members of their staff, and some professional actors to ride with them in a rented bus over a holiday weekend, and film whatever happened, with magical elements to be added later. Making the movie was one of the first jobs of the Beatles's new company, Apple Corps.\nEpstein unfortunately died before filming began. Without him to look over business details, things ran into trouble. By the time things were set up, John Lennon and George Harrison had changed their minds about performing, and spent much of the bus trip asleep. There also was not much for scenery along the roads, or entertainment among the passengers.\nWhat turned into a bigger event than filming \"Magical Mystery Tour\" was the that began to surround the bus, wondering what the \"tour\" was all about. People followed the bus for miles, and caused . People who saw the bus go by expected a \"happening\" of some kind, but none had been planned. In trying to be , nobody had worked out a for the bus, or the trip. Most of the commotion ended after Lennon personally removed the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR lettering from the sides of the bus. Later a Beatles assistant said the traffic jams should have also been filmed.\nSpots for songs and performances were included in \"Magical Mystery Tour\", and so was a explaining what the trip was about. The songs featured in the show included \"The Fool on the Hill\", \"I Am The Walrus\", \"Blue Jay Way\", an instrumental song, \"Flying\", and \"Your Mother Should Know\", with a choreographed dance sequence. Another band, the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, played live during a striptease performance.\n\"Magical Mystery Tour\" appeared on British television on Boxing Day in 1967, and was a surprising flop. Part of the reason for its failure was because it was shown in black-and-white, while colour was an important feature. Another part was because most of the viewers did not understand what was supposed to be happening. Another part was that not much had happened on camera, for long parts of the programme, and it showed.\nRingo Starr made a personal appeal to the BBC to show \"Magical Mystery Tour\" again, in full colour. The BBC gave it a second broadcast, but it did not change opinions. ABC in the United States cancelled plans to show \"Magical Mystery Tour\" in America. (It later appeared as a \"midnight movie\", shown in small cinemas and on college campuses.)\nSoundtrack.\nEven though \"Magical Mystery Tour\" was not a television success, its soundtrack still sold well. The show's songs were released as a double EP in England, with a storybook and pictures from the show. In America, Capitol Records added songs from recent Beatles singles to the show songs, and released a whole album. The American version outsold the EP in England, and in 1977 Parlophone Records released a British version of the album.\nSongs.\n+ \"appeared in the show Magical Mystery Tour \"\nAll songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, except \"Flying\" (by Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr) and \"Blue Jay Way\" (by George Harrison)."}

It is used for castles in the Languedoc-Roussillon, usually built by the enemies of the Cathars during the Albigensian Crusade. \nThe true Cathar castles.\nThe Cathars built fortified homesteads, but not castles. The legend of Cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth. The cathar church did not build anything. For this reason, the only ones which can claim the description \"Cathar\" are the small castles, often totally unknown to the public. Their unspectacular ruins are often far-away from tourist routes.\nThe royal citadels.\nBecause Raimond II was unable to recapture Carcassone in 1240, the city walls were strengthened by the French King. He also destroyed small \"castra\" in the Corbi\u00e8res region and built citadels to protect the border with the kingdom of Aragon.\nThese five castles are often called the \"cinq fils de Carcassonne\" (five sons of Carcassonne):\nThese five fortresses resisted various assaults led by the Aragonese army.\nThe abandonment of the citadels.\nIn 1659, Louis XIV and the Philip IV of Spain signed the Treaty of the Pyrenees. The French king also married the Infanta Marie Therese. The treaty changed the borders. It gave Rousillon to France and moved the frontier south to the crest of the Pyrenees, where it is now. The fortresses therefore lost their importance. Some maintained a garrison for a while, a few until the French Revolution, but they slowly fell into decay, often becoming sherpherds' shelters or bandits hideouts."}

It was started in 1907 by Robert Baden-Powell as a movement for boys. \nBaden-Powell took many ideas from the experiences he made with the Mafeking Cadet Corps. This corps was a paramilitary group made of boys. It was formed during a siege in the Second Boer War. The boys mainly carried messages. This was so the soldiers could focus on defending the city.\nOriginally, the Scout movement was for boys only. A similar movement for girls, called \"Girl Guides\" was started in 1910. In most countries there are associations for Scouts and for Girl Guides. Today the Scouts often accept girls, too.\nIn the Scout movement, people learn to work together to achieve a goal. They also train their character to become better adults.\nUsually Scouts give a promise to live by certain rules, and to help others when they can.\nScouts spend their time outdoors, whenever possible.\nHow many Scouts there are.\nIn 2005, there were more than 28 million Boy Scouts and over 10 million Girl Guides. They came from 216 different countries. There were only six countries with no Scout movement in 2006. They were Andorra, People's Republic of China, Cuba, Laos, Myanmar and North Korea.\nIn Cuba, there was a Scout organisation, but the Communist government replaced it by the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Pioneer Organization, which is similar to Scouts, but without the international brotherhood and the peace mission.\nScouting organisations have been banned in People's Republic of China. They have been replaced by Young Pioneers of China and Communist Youth League of China. These organisations are a bit similar to Scouts, but without the international brotherhood and the peace mission. There is a Scout Association in Hong Kong and one in Macau. Hong Kong and Macau are Special Autonomous Regions of the People's Republic of China, so the Scout associations there are still allowed to exist. In the Republic of China (Taiwan) Scouting was never banned.\nThere are no Scouting organisations in Myanmar, but there are a few Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts (headed by the US Scout movement) in Yangon.\nHow it started.\nRobert Baden-Powell was a military officer. He was stationed in India and Africa in the 1880s and 1890s. Since his youth, he was fond of woodcraft and military scouting. He therefore showed his men how to survive in the wilderness. He noticed that if he taught the soldiers to develop independence, they would no longer follow the orders given by their officers blindly.\nIn 1896, during the Second Matabele War, Baden-Powell first met and became friends with the American-born British Army Chief of Scouts Frederick Russell Burnham. From Burnham he learned the ways of cowboy and Indian scouts of the Western United States, he started to wear a scout hat like the one worn by Burnham and he discussed with Burnham a scout training programme for boys. Three years later during the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell was besieged in the small town of Mafeking by a much larger Boer army (the Siege of Mafeking). The Mafeking Cadet Corps was a group of youths that supported the troops. The cadets carried messages. This freed the men for military duties. It also kept the boys occupied during the long siege. The Cadet Corps performed well, helping in the defence of the town (1899\u20131900). This experience was one of the many factors that inspired Baden-Powell to form the Scouting movement. Each member received a badge that showed a combined compass point and spearhead. The badge's logo was similar to the fleur-de-lis that Scouting later adopted as its international symbol.\nIn the United Kingdom the public followed his struggle to hold Mafeking through newspapers. After the siege, Baden-Powell had become a national hero. This pushed the sales of a small instruction book he had written about military scouting, \"Aids to Scouting\".\nOn his return to England he noticed the large interest of boys in this book, which was also used by teachers and youth organisations. Several people suggested to him to rewrite this book for boys, especially during an inspection of the Boys' Brigade. This brigade was a large youth movement, drilled with military precision. Baden-Powell thought this would not be attractive and suggested that it could grow much larger when scouting would be used. He studied other schemes, parts of which he used for Scouting.\nThe promise of 1907.\nIn his original book on boy scouting, General Baden-Powell introduced the Scout promise, as follows:\nOther Scout-like organisations.\nSince the Scouts were formed, other people have tried to form scout-like movements. These movements are a bit like the Scouts but they put more weight on different things. There are for example Scout-like movements that focus more on the fact that the young people should get a good education in religious matters. The movements that have been formed in countries such as Cuba or China are much like Scouts; they leave out some elements though, that the national governments thought would harm the country."}

There have been found fossilised remains of about one million years ago.\nAustronesian people, who form the majority of the modern population, came to South East Asia from Taiwan. They arrived in Indonesia around 2000\u00a0BC. The native Melanesian peoples went to the far eastern regions. The agricultural conditions were very good. When wet-field rice cultivation was developed as early as the eighth century BC,\nvillages and towns developed, and small kingdoms began to flourish by the first century CE. Indonesia's sea-lane position helped with management of international trade, where trade with both Indian kingdoms and China already occured for several centuries BCE. Therefore, trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history.\nFrom the seventh century CE, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade. Hinduism and Buddhism were imported with it. In the late 13th century, the Hindu kingdom was founded in eastern Java and under Gajah Mada, its influence stretched over much of Indonesia; this period is often referred to as a \"Golden Age\" in Indonesian history.\nDuring the 13th century Islam spread to the in northern Sumatra. More and more Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam. By the end of the 16th century it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra. But it mixed with existing cultural and religious influences. \nThe first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serr\u00e3o, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb pepper in Maluku. Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power. But Dutch control stretched not very far. Only in the early 20th century it extended to borders of today.\nDuring the Second World War the Dutch lost control and in August 1945, Sukarno, an influential nationalist leader, declared independence and was appointed president. After some fights the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesian independence in December 1949 (with the exception of The Dutch territory of West New Guinea).\nSukarno moved from democracy towards dictatorship. But Sukarno lost power to the head of the military, General Suharto who was formally appointed president in March 1968. He was supported by the US government, and encouraged foreign direct investment in Indonesia, which helped economic growth during the following thirty years. But his rule went along with corruption and suppression of political opposition.\nIn 1997 and 1998, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the . This increased popular discontent with the New Order and led to popular protests. Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998. In 1999, East Timor voted to leave the state of Indonesia, after a twenty-five-year military occupation. After Suharto's resignation democracy improved. A regional autonomy program was introduced, and the first direct presidential election took place in 2004. But some political and economic instability has remained. A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005."}

In Hebrew it is known as Wayiqra' (\u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05e7\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0), meaning 'And He will declare.' It was written by the Old Testament Patriarch Moses. Leviticus was written to the Hebrew people of Israel. The book has several main topics, some of which are the Jewish laws of sacrificing to God, and the work of the priests. These priests are sometimes known as Levites (what this book is named after).\nWhen was it written.\nIt was likely developed over a long period of time, reaching its present form during the Persian empire (Yehud Madinata) between 538-332 BCE. Tradition says this book was written around 1300 B.C. by Moses. \nSummary.\nGod gives more instructions to Moses. God asks Moses to repeat what He said to Moses' people, the Israelites. \nContinuing from Exodus the Israelites are escaping Egypt. They reach the Biblical Mount Sinai. In Exodus, Moses learned from God how to build the holy tabernacle (a tent for praying and worshiping). In Leviticus God teaches Moses and the Levites how to make sacrifices and how to behave in a good way.\nThe first few chapters show God's laws for offering sacrifices for various reasons, such as for the forgiveness of sins.\nThen Moses makes Aaron a priest of God. Details about how the priests are to make sacrifices to God are given. This is sometimes called the \"ceremonial law\". Two sons of Aaron were destroyed for doing the work of the priest in the wrong way. \nThen God teaches the people how to eat right and be clean. Examples of food that are forbidden are pork and shrimp. Meat is also not to be eaten with milk at the same time. Beyond that, eaten meat is to be taken from animals that were slaughtered in a specific way. The meat must not contain blood either, as this is seen as representing life in the face of the animal having died. Regarding staying clean, laws are given about menstruation (the monthly period), sexual relations, skin disease, and how dead bodies are to be disposed of. \nThe rest of the book describes how priests, the Levites, should be ordained, should dress, carry out rituals, and act (for example on the Day of Atonement, and other important Holy Days)."}

It is not clear who wrote the book, although most of the Jewish tradition believe it was Joshua, son of Nun. It is the first of the books of the Tanakh (Old Testament) covering the history of Israel from the arrival in the Promised Land to the Babylonian captivity.\nIt is not known when the Book was written, but it cannot have been written before roughly 1200 BC, as the events described in the book occur then. Some scholars believe it was written much later, perhaps in 550 BC, at the time of the Babylonian exile, when there was a desire to remember and retell their own history.\nSummary.\nAfter the death of Moses, God put Joshua in charge of the people. Joshua sent two spies to spy on the city of Jericho. A woman prostitute called Rahab hid these two men and told the enemies they had already left. She hid them on top of her roof, underneath stalks of flax. The spies later promised that they would keep the oath that Joshua made with them.\nJericho fell when the people of Israel, instructed by God, circled around the wall of Jericho seven times and blew their ram's horns, and on the seventh time, they all shouted with a great shout, causing the wall to fall.\nJoshua told the spies to go to Rahab's house and bring out her family and belongings. The spies did as they were told, as they kept the oath. Joshua saved Rahab's life, and she went to live in Israel.\nLater, God told Joshua to invade the city of Ai. After they did this, the people of Gibeon tricked Joshua into a treaty.\nHowever, three days later, the people of Israel realized that they really made a treaty with Gibeon's neighbors, the Hivites. The Hivities became cursed, but the people of Gibeon promised that they would do whatever the Israelites say.\nAfter making peace with the Hivites, they went to lay siege to Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua saying he needs to save the people of Gibeon. So, God killed many of the Amorites by making large hailstones. Then Joshua made the sun stay over Gibeon, and the moon over Ajalon. Joshua later got very old and died.\nQuotes.\nNo one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so too I will be with you; I will not fail you nor forsake you.

The reason for this form of education is usually the guardian is not happy with the nearby schools, or sometimes for religious or moral purposes. Many people also want to protect children from bullying and violence. In recent years, it became popular in many countries.\nBefore starting homeschooling, it can be a good idea to deschool first. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, any homeschool arrangement must by law satisfy inspectors that the children's education is sound. This is because, under the Education Act of 1944, parents or guardians are legally obliged to send children to school. The possibility of other methods has been added as a possibility, subject to certain checks.\nA common situation is for several families to come together to provide the skills needed. This serves two purposes. First, the range of knowledge and skills is wider, and the schooling has a more social angle, which itself is good for the development of children.\nIn most countries, homeschooling is a legal alternative to going to a school.\nUnschooling is a very free type of homeschooling.\nHistory and publications.\nThe idea of home schools came to life in the 1960s, when the effectiveness of classroom education was challenged. There were a number of critical publications:\nAlternatives and dangers.\nSome private schools try to achieve similar objectives by other means. Summerhill attempts to make a school more flexible and responsive to the needs of individual children.\nDangers of home education include the possibility of it being used for religious and political propaganda, and the vulnerability of children to unsupervised adults. Education may be uneven, leaving children with a patchy grasp of many subjects. The children would also get to know fewer other children than they would ordinarily. Also, it is obvious that some parents are better placed to organise home education than others.\nIn theory, visits by the inspectors of schools might be able to identify problems. However, at least in the United Kingdom, schools are not inspected every year. If we cannot inspect all schools annually, how can we expect to monitor individual families?"}

Even today, San Pedro de Macor\u00eds is called sometimes \"Mosquitisol\" after those two old and small towns.\nSince 1852, there was a military post in this place: the Military Post of Macor\u00eds, part of the Hato Mayor del Rey municipality in the El Seibo Province.\nIn 1856, the priest Pedro Carrasco built a Catholic church with the name \"San Pedro Ap\u00f3stol\"; the church was between the two towns of Mosquito and Sol. Both towns grew in direction of the church, forming one town called San Pedro de Macor\u00eds.\nWhen the country was again a Spanish colony, San Pedro de Macor\u00eds was made a \"Comandancia de Armas\" (an Spanish military category). When the country was free again, in 1865, every town with the category of \"Comandancia de Armas\" became a municipality. But San Pedro de Macor\u00eds was still a very small town of the El Seibo Province.\nAfter 1868, with the sugarcane plantations and the sugar factories, San Pedro de Macor\u00eds began to grow and it became one of the most important city in the Dominican Republic. Many people from Cuba and Puerto Rico came to live here during the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century. Later came people from Spain and the Middle East (Lebanon, Syria) to work in businesses.\nTo work in the sugarcane fields and factories, people from Haiti and the British West Indies came to San Pedro de Macor\u00eds and other regions of the country.\nPopulation.\nThe city had, in , a total population of 195,307: 94,562 men and 100,745 women.

The book was written to the people of Galatia, a part of modern day Turkey, with whom Paul had earlier preached and founded the congregation in their area.\nIt is not known for sure, but most believe that the book was written around 57 A.D. One of the curious verses in the letter is where Paul says \"See with what large letters I am writing this in my own hand\". (Chapter 6, verse 11). This is understood to mean that normally Paul used a secretary to write down as he spoke his letters. However he wanted the Galatians to be sure it was he himself that was the author of the letter they would receive so he wrote a few lines himself. Some believe he had poor eyesight and so had to write with \"large letters\".\nContent.\nPaul's letter is to settle an important question of that day. It is if the gentile Christians must first join the Jewish religion and keep the Law of Moses. Paul says that the gentile Galatians do not need to keep the old Laws such as the need for circumcision, which is the removal of some skin around the male sex organ, done by Jews and Muslims as an act of religious obedience to God. Paul says that this is no longer important since Jesus has come. Paul says it is not good that the community has turned from the gospel (Chapter 1, verses 6\u201310) He says there is only one gospel and one way of being saved through faith in Christ and that adding to that makes it another gospel. He talks about his early life as a Jew, (Chapter 1, verses 13\u201314), how he met Christ, often called the conversion of Paul, (Chapter 1, verses 15\u201316), and his early work (Chapter 1 verses 17\u201324). He tells about meeting with the other Christian leaders in Jerusalem as reported in Acts chapter 15, verses 2:1\u201310. He says that they agreed with him that the gentiles did not need to be become practicing Jews first. In Chapter 2 he tells about a meeting with Peter where he told Peter that he was not acting properly towards the gentile Christians by not eating with them. Then he says that Jews, like Gentiles, are not made right with God by keeping the old Law but by trusting in what Jesus did for them when He died on the cross. Later in the book he tells that the Law was given to show us how sinful we are so that we would see the need for forgiveness. He says that when we love others we have fulfilled the true meaning of the Law. He writes that when we have faith, God sends the Holy Spirit who helps us live a good life and keep from bad things. He gives a list of those bad and good actions. (Chapter 5)\nImportance.\nThe Epistle to the Galatians has been very important in the history of Christianity, the development of Christian theology, and the study of the apostle Paul.\nThe book contains some of the most known Bible teachings, such as that all have need of salvation (Galatians 3:28-29), and the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)."}

Its scientific name is \"Homo neanderthalensis\" or \"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis\".\nNeanderthal fossils were only found in Europe, Asia Minor and up to central Asia. The first fossil was found in a limestone quarry near D\u00fcsseldorf: One of the workers found part of a skeleton, in a valley called Neanderthal. Experts Johann Carl Fuhlrott and Hermann Schaaffhausen said the bones belonged to an older form of modern humans. These bones are known as Neanderthal 1 today.\nRecent research suggests Neanderthals became extinct about 40,000 years ago. Earlier research had suggested a later date; the problem is the dating of the archaeological sites where their remains have been found.\nNeanderthals perhaps evolved from \"Homo heidelbergensis\" and split off (last common ancestor) from modern humans between 700,000 and 300,000 years ago.\nNeanderthals used to be classified as a subspecies of modern humans (\"Homo sapiens neanderthalensis\"). Now, they are usually classified as a separate human species (\"Homo neanderthalensis\").\nNeanderthal remains have been found in most of Europe south of land covered by ice including the south coast of Great Britain. Finds have also been made outside of Europe in the Zagros Mountains and in the Levant.\nMental capacity.\nThe size of the Neanderthal brain shows that Neanderthals were probably intelligent. On average, they had larger brains than modern humans. Large brains are something of a physical weakness. That is because they consume lots of energy, make the skull more likely to be damaged, and cause difficulties during birth. These disadvantages may be less than the advantages, for example, better problem-solving, better social co-operation, language and tool-making.\nNeanderthal flint tools (for example, hand axes) were more finely made than those of early man. They were much less varied and finely made than the neolithic tools of modern man. Known Neaderthal art is much less complex than contemporary art from H. \"sapiens.\"\nThe Divje Babe flute.\nThe oldest flute ever discovered may be the so-called Divje Babe flute, found in the Slovenian cave Divje Babe I in 1995. It is about 43,100 years old. It is from a juvenile cave bear femur at the Divje Babe site, near a Mousterian hearth. Archaeologists ask two key questions:\nIs it a flute? This has been discussed at length. The best summary is that it is certainly possible for it to be a flute, but it is unproved (not certain).\nIf it is a flute, was it made by Neanderthals? Again, this is not decided. It is on public display as a flute in the National Museum of Slovenia (Narodni Muzej Slovenije) in Ljubljana. The museum's visitor leaflet says that manufacture by Neanderthals \"is reliably proven\". This is not a general view, and again it is best to describe the idea as \"not proven\".\nCapacity for speech.\nFor a long time, people have wondered whether Neanderthals could talk. Many people believe they could, because the large brain size would be hard to understand if they could not. When an undamaged Neanderthal hyoid bone was discovered, it made people think Neanderthals could talk. That is because, in humans, the hyoid is a support for the voice box. Computer analysis has shown that the Neanderthal hyoid was very similar to human hyoids. Researchers say \"our findings are consistent with a capacity for speech in the Neanderthals\".\nHistory of discoveries.\nIn August 1856 the specimen that was to become known as Neanderthal 1 was discovered in the Neander Valley, Germany. The material was found in a limestone quarry near D\u00fcsseldorf. A skull cap was first discovered, followed by two femurs, five arm bones, part of the left pelvis, and fragments of a shoulder blade and ribs.\nActually, some remains had been found earlier, but not recognised as a separate species from us. The Engis child from Belgium was the first Neanderthal discovered, in 1829. The second discovered was the Forbes Quarry find from Gibralter in 1848.\nAnatomy.\nNeanderthal men were about 164\u2013168\u00a0cm (5.3\u00a0ft) tall and averaged 77.6\u00a0kg (171\u00a0lbs) in weight. Neanderthal women stood about 154\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft) tall and averaged 66.4\u00a0kg (146\u00a0lbs) in weight.\nNeanderthals had stronger (more robust) build and distinctive morphological features, especially of the skull. They were much stronger than modern humans; especially in the upper body.\nNeanderthal long bones and joints are thicker than ours, and some long bones have a slight curve. Both the thickness and the curve suggest the need for more strength than our species.\nYoung Neanderthals.\nSince 2007, tooth age can be directly calculated using the noninvasive imaging of growth patterns in tooth enamel by means of x-ray synchrotron microtomography.\nThis research suggests much more rapid physical development in Neanderthals than in modern human children. The x-ray synchrotron microtomography study of early \"H. sapiens\" argues that this difference existed between the two species as far back as 160,000 years before present.\nFractures.\nNeanderthals seemed to suffer a high frequency of fractures. These fractures are often healed and show little or no sign of infection, suggesting that injured individuals were cared for during times of incapacitation.\nNeanderthals showed a frequency of such injuries comparable to that of modern rodeo professionals, showing frequent contact with large, combative mammals. The fractures suggest they may have hunted by leaping onto their prey and stabbing or even wrestling it to the ground.\nLife style.\nThey lived in Eurasia during the ice ages of the Pleistocene, and hunted large mammals, such as bison, auroch (an ancestor of living cattle), deer, reindeer, musk ox and mammoth.\nThe skulls are slightly larger than \"Homo sapiens\", and this implies intelligence and probably the use of language. The skeleton, on the other hand, suggests they tended to solve their problems (such as hunting) more by force than we do.\nNeanderthal stone tools are called Mousterian, and are an advance on the Acheulean tools made by earlier species of Man. \"Homo sapiens\" stone tools are far more varied still, and suggest that our species relied more on tools than the Neanderthals.\nNeanderthals were almost exclusively meat eaters although their diet did include cooked vegetables. They made good tools and lived in complex social groups. Research on their remains has shown that it is possible that they had a spoken language but the nature of any such language is unknown.\nThere are a number of theories that try to explain why the Neanderthals died out. It has been suggested that they may have been unable to adapt to the changing climate. Alternatively it has been suggested that they were unable to successfully compete with the ancestors of modern humans."}

Fossil remains were found in Java (1890s) and in China (1921). Nearly all of them were lost during World War II, but there are casts that are considered to be reliable evidence.\nEarly in the 20th century it was believed that the first modern humans lived in Asia. But during the 1950s and 1970s, many fossil finds from East Africa (Kenya) showed that the oldest hominins came from there.\nSome characteristics.\n\"H. erectus\" had a cranial capacity (brain size) greater than that the earlier \"Homo habilis\". The earliest \"H. erectus\" remains have a cranial capacity of 850\u00a0cm\u00b3, while the latest Javan specimens measure up to 1100\u00a0cm\u00b3. This overlaps that of \"H. sapiens\": the frontal bone is less sloped and the dental arcade smaller than in australopithecines. The face is more vertical (less protrusive) than either the australopithecines or \"H. habilis\", with large brow-ridges and less prominent cheekbones.\nThese early hominins stood about , Only 17 percent of modern male humans are taller. They were slender, with long arms and legs.\nThe sexual dimorphism between males and females was slightly greater than modern man, with males being about 25% larger than females. The discovery of the skeleton KNM-WT 15000, \"Turkana boy\" (\"Homo ergaster\"), made near Lake Turkana, Kenya by Richard Leakey and Kamoya Kimeu in 1984, is one of the most complete hominid-skeletons discovered, and has contributed greatly to the interpretation of human physiological evolution.\nTools.\nThe most distinctive tool of erectus was the Acheulean hand axe, first invented 1.8 million years ago (mya). This hand axe was made by chipping a suitable stone with a hammer stone. Later, the neanderthals used a soft hammer made of deer antler bone to make better tools. The Acheulean hand axe lasted for over a million years as the main tool. Its main use was for butchering meat. This we know because different uses leave different micro-wear on the hand axe surfaces.\nDescendants and subspecies.\n\"Homo erectus\" remains one of the most successful and long-lived species of the \"Homo\" genus. It is generally considered to have given rise to a number of descendant species and subspecies. The oldest known specimen of the ancient human was found in southern Africa.\n\"Homo ergaster\",\n\"Homo erectus pekinensis\",\n\"Homo antecessor\",\n\"Homo cepranensis\",\n\"Homo floresiensis\",\n\"Homo georgicus\"\n\"Homo heidelbergensis\",\n\"Homo neanderthalensis\",\n\"Homo rhodesiensis\",\n\"Homo sapiens\",\nIndividual fossils.\nSome of the major \"Homo erectus\" fossils:\nRecent research.\nFossil \"H. erectus\" skulls found in Java in the 1930s have recently been redated. There are 12 skullcaps (top part of skull) and two lower leg bones. The recent research shows that on Java, \"H. erectus\" survived to about 100,000 years ago. The research gives a definitive age of between 117,000 and 108,000 years ago. That is much a much longer survival than in any other part of the world, so far as is known. This means, says the report, that \"H. erectus\" was still around when our own species was [elsewhere] walking the Earth. Java is an island, and presumably it had not yet been discovered by Neanderthals or our own species. Remains suggest that our own species did not reach Java until about 39,000 years ago."}

{"id": "102318", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102318", "title": "Palaeolithic", "text": "The Palaeolithic, (or Paleolithic), refers to the prehistoric period when stone tools were made by humans. They are found in the Great Rift Valley of Africa from about 3.3 million years ago. They were probably made by Australopithecines. They are found in Europe somewhat later, from about 1 mya (0.7mya for Britain). The Palaeolithic is by far the longest period of humanity's time, about 99% of human history. The geological period which corresponds to the Palaeolithic is the Pleistocene.\nStone tools were not only made by our own species, \"Homo sapiens\". They were made by all previous members of the genus, starting with relatively crude tools made by \"Homo habilis\" and \"Homo erectus\". In Europe, the large-brained Neanderthal Man (\"Homo neanderthalensis\") made tools of high quality, and was in turn outshone by the many tools made by our own species. These tools are the first cultural products which have survived.\nThe Palaeolithic dates from about 2.6 million years ago and ended around 15,000 with the Mesolithic in Western Europe, and with the Epipaleolithic in warmer climates such as Africa. The Palaeolithic age began when hominids (early humans) started to use stones as tools for bashing, cutting and scraping. The age ended when humans began to make small, fine tools (Mesolithic) and finally when humans began to plant crops and have other types of agriculture (Neolithic). In some areas, such as Western Europe, the way that people lived was affected by the Ice age. The move towards agriculture started in the Middle East.\nDuring the Palaeolithic Age humans grouped together in small bands. They lived by gathering plants and hunting wild animals. As well as using stone tools, they used tools of wood and bone. They probably also used leather and vegetable fibers but these have not lasted from that time.\nCultures.\nOldowan.\nThe Oldowan is the archaeological term used to refer to the stone tool industry that was used by hominids during the earliest Palaeolithic period. For a long time it was thought that the Oldowan was the earliest stone tool industry in prehistory, from 2.6 million years ago up until 1.7 million years ago. It was followed by the more sophisticated Acheulean industry. Oldowan tools were therefore the earliest tools in human history, and mark the beginning of the archaeological record. The term \"Oldowan\" is taken from the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where the first Oldowan tools were discovered by the archaeologist Louis Leakey in the 1930s. Now it is realised that stone tools were used much earlier (3.3 million years ago) and that was definitely before the genus \"Homo\" had evolved.\nIt is not known for sure which species actually created and used Oldowan tools. It reached its peak with early species of \"Homo\" such as \"H. habilis\" and \"H. ergaster\". Early \"Homo erectus\" appears to inherit Oldowan technology and refines it into the Acheulean industry beginning 1.7 million years ago. Oldowan tools are sometimes called \"pebble tools\", so named because the blanks chosen for their production already resemble, in pebble form, the final product. Oldowan tools are sometimes subdivided into types, such as chopper, scrapers and pounders, as these seem to be their main uses.\nAcheulean.\nAcheulean is the industry of stone tool manufacture by early humans of the Lower Palaeolithic era in Africa and much of West Asia and Europe. Acheulean tools are typically found with \"Homo erectus\" remains. They are first developed out of the more primitive Oldowan technology some 1.8 million years ago, by \"Homo habilis\".\nIt was the dominant technology for most of human history. More than a million years ago Acheulean tool users left Africa to colonize Eurasia. Their oval and pear-shaped hand axes have been found over a wide area. Some examples were finely made. Although it developed in Africa, the industry is named after the type site of Saint-Acheul, now a suburb of Amiens in northern France where some of the first examples were found in the 19th century.\nJohn Frere was the first to suggest in writing a very ancient date for Acheulean hand-axes. In 1797 he sent two examples to the Royal Academy in London from Hoxne in Suffolk. He had found them in prehistoric lake deposits along with the bones of extinct animals and concluded that they were made by people \"who had not the use of metals\" and that they belonged to a \"very ancient period indeed, even beyond the present world\". His ideas were ignored by his contemporaries however, who held a pre-Darwinian view of human evolution.\nDating the Acheulean.\nRadiometric dating, often potassium-argon dating, of deposits containing Acheulean material is able to broadly place Acheulean techniques from around 1.65 million years ago to about 100,000 years ago. The earliest accepted examples of the type, at 1.65 m years old, come from the West Turkana region of Kenya. Some think their origin might be as early as 1.8 million years ago.\nIn individual regions, this dating can be considerably refined; in Europe for example, Acheulean methods did not reach the continent until around 400 thousand years ago and in smaller study areas, the date ranges can be much shorter. Numerical dates can be misleading however, and it is common to associate examples of this early human tool industry with one or more glacial or interglacial periods or with a particular early species of human. The earliest user of Acheulean tools was \"Homo ergaster\" who first appeared about 1.8 million years ago. Some researchers prefer to call these users \"early Homo erectus\". Later forms of early humans also used Acheulean techniques and are described below.\nThere is considerable time overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries. In some regions Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian. Then, later, Acheulean tools occur at the same time as the more sophisticated Mousterian. The Acheulean was not a neatly defined period, but a tool-making technique which flourished especially well in early prehistory. Acheulean was a basic method for making stone tools which was shared across much of the Old World.\nClactonian.\nThe Clactonian is an industry of European flint tool manufacture that dates to the early part of the interglacial period 400,000 years ago. Clactonian tools were made by \"Homo erectus\" rather than modern humans. Early, crude flint tools from other regions using similar methods are called either Clactonian or \"core &amp; flake\" technology.\nThe Clactonian is named after finds made at Clacton-on-Sea in the English county of Essex in 1911. The artefacts found there included flint chopping tools, flint flakes and the tip of a worked wooden shaft along with the remains of a giant elephant and hippopotamus. Further examples of the tools have been found at sites in Swanscombe, Kent, and Barnham in Suffolk; similar industries have been identified across Northern Europe.\nThe Clactonian industry involved striking thick, irregular flakes from a core of flint, which was then employed as a chopper. The flakes would have been used as crude knives or scrapers. Unlike the Oldowan tools from which Clactonian ones derived, some were notched implying that they were attached to a handle or shaft.\nThe Clactonian industry may have co-existed with the Acheulean industry (which used handaxes). However, in 2004 there was an excavation of a butchered Pleistocene elephant near Dartford, Kent. Archaeologists recovered numerous Clactonian flint tools, but no handaxes. Since handaxes would be more useful than choppers to dismember an elephant carcass, this is evidence of the Clactonian being a separate industry. Flint of sufficient quality was available in the area, so probably the people who carved up the elephant did not have the knowledge to make handaxes.\nMousterian.\nThe Mousterian is an industry of stone tools associated with Neanderthal Man, \"Homo neanderthalensis\". It dates from about 300,000 years to about 30,000 years ago. There are up to thirty types of tools in the Mousterian as contrasted with about six in the Acheulean.\nThe Mousterian was named after the type site of Le Moustier, a rock shelter in the Dordogne region of France. Similar flintwork has been found all over unglaciated Europe and also the Near East and North Africa. Handaxes, long blades\nand points typify the industry. Overall, the items are more perfectly finished than any previous work. The method used to get the blades and flakes is called the Levallois technique. It is a prepared-core technique: the core is worked on so that a long, fine blade can be struck off. For this quality of work, a 'soft' hammer made of something like deer antler is necessary, rather than a stone hammer. The extra brain size of the Neanderthals is probably relevant to these advances.\nThe cultures which follow the Mousterian are all cultures of modern humans, \"Homo sapiens\". It is characteristic of our species to produce many more tools, all specialised for particular tasks. There are at least 100 types of tools in the Upper Palaeolithic compared to a maximum of 30 tools in the Mousterian.\nChronology of Palaeolithic and following periods.\nThe Palaeolithic is sometimes divided into three (somewhat overlapping) periods which mark technological and cultural advances in different human communities:\nAfter the Palaeolithic follows the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras, which marks the end of Stone Age. The Bronze Age and the Iron Age come right after the Stone Age.\nOverview of the main features of these periods.\nVenus figurines.\nPossibly among the earliest traces of art are Venus figurines. These are \"figurines\" (very small statues) of women, mostly pregnant with visible breasts. The figurines were found in areas of Western Europe to Siberia. Most are between 20,000 and 30,000 years old. Two figurines have been found that are much older: the Venus of Tan-Tan, dated to 300,000 to 500,000 years ago was found in Morocco. The Venus of Berekhat Ram was found on the Golan Heights. It has been dated to 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. It may be the one of the earliest things that show the human form.\nDifferent kinds of stone, bones and ivory were used to make the figurines. Some are also made of clay which was then burned in a fire. This is one of the earliest known traces of the use of ceramics.\nToday it is not known what the figurines meant to the people who made them. There are two basic theories:\nScientists have excluded that these figurines were linked to the fertility of fields, because agriculture had not been discovered at the time the figurines were made.\nThe two figurines that are older may have mostly formed by natural processes. The Venus of Tan-Tan was covered with a substance that could have been some kind of paint. The substance contained traces of iron and manganese. The figurine of Berekhat Ram shows traces that someone worked on it with a tool. A study done in 1997 states that these traces could not have been left by nature alone.\nCave paintings.\nCave paintings are paintings that were made on the walls or roofs of caves. Many cave paintings belong to the Palaeolothic Age, and date from about 15,000 to 30,000 years ago. Among the most famous are those in the caves of Altamira in Spain and Lascaux in France.p545 There are about 350 caves in Europe where cave paintings have been found. Usually, animals have been painted, like aurochs, bisons or horses. Why these paintings were done is not known. They are not simply decorations of places where people lived. The caves they were found in usually do not show signs that someone lived in them.\nOne of the oldest caves is that of Chauvet in France. Paintings in the cave fall into two groups. One has been dated to around 30,000 to 33,000 years ago, the other to 26,000 or 27,000 years ago.p546 The oldest known cave paintings, based on radiocarbon dating of \"black from drawings, from torch marks and from the floors\". As of 1999, the dates of 31 samples from the cave have been reported. The oldest paintings have been dated from 32,900\u00b1490 years ago.\nSome archaeologists have questioned the dating. Z\u00fcchner believe the two groups date from 23,000\u201324,000, and 10,000\u201318,000 years ago. Pettitt and Bahn believe the dating is inconsistent. They say the people at that periods of time painted things differently. They also do not know where the charcoal used to paint some things is from, and how big the painted area is.\nPeople from the Palaeolithic era drew well. They knew about perspective, and they knew of different ways to draw things. They also were able to observe the behaviour of animals they painted. Some of the paintings show how the painted animals behaved. The paintings may have been important for rituals.\nDiet and nutrition.\nIn general.\nPaleolithic hunting and gathering people ate leafy vegetables, fruit, nuts and insects, meat, fish, and shellfish. As there is little direct evidence, it is almost impossible to determine the relative proportions of plant and animal foods. There is a modern diet called paleolithic diet, but it has few things in common with the paleolitic diet of the time. Even the claim that most humans of a given period shared the same diet is problematic. The Paleolithic was an extended period of time. During that time, there were many technological advances, many of which had impact on human dietary structure. For example, humans probably did not possess the control of fire until the Middle Paleolithic, or tools necessary to engage in extensive fishing. On the other hand, both these technologies are generally agreed to have been widely available to humans by the end of the Paleolithic (consequently, allowing humans in some regions of the planet to rely heavily on fishing and hunting). In addition, the Paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations. During the Lower Paleolithic, ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to Africa east of the Great Rift Valley. During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, humans greatly expanded their area of settlement, reaching ecosystems as diverse as New Guinea and Alaska. The also needed to adapt their diets to the local resources that were available.\nAnthropologists have different opinions about the proportions of plant and animal foods consumed. Just as with still existing hunters and gatherers, there were many varied \"diets\" - in different groups -of fruit and vegetables. The relative proportions of plant and animal foods in the diets of Paleolithic people often varied between regions; in colder regions, more meat was necessary. These regions were not populated by anatomically modern humans until 30,000-50,000 BP. It is generally agreed that many modern hunting and fishing tools, such as fish hooks, nets, bows, and poisons, were not introduced until the Upper Palaeolithic and possibly even Neolithic. The only hunting tools widely available to humans during any significant part of the Paleolithic period were hand-held spears and harpoons. There's evidence of Paleolithic people killing and eating seals and elands as far as 100,000 years BP. On the other hand, buffalo bones found in African caves from the same period are typically of very young or very old individuals, and there's no evidence that pigs, elephants or rhinos were hunted by humans at the time.\nDevelopments.\nAnother view is that until the Upper Paleolithic, humans were frugivores (fruit eaters) who supplemented their meals with carrion, eggs, and small prey such as baby birds and mussels. Only on rare occasions did they manage to kill and consume big game such as antelopes. This view is supported by studies of higher apes, particularly chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are the closest to humans genetically. They share more than 96% of their DNA code with humans, and their digestive tract is functionally very similar. Chimpanzees are primarily frugivores, but they could and would consume and digest animal flesh, given the opportunity. In general, their actual diet in the wild is about 95% plant-based, with the remaining 5% filled with insects, eggs, and baby animals. In some ecosystems, however, chimpanzees are predatory, forming parties to hunt monkeys. Some comparative studies of human and higher primate digestive tracts do suggest that humans have evolved to obtain greater amounts of calories from sources such as animal foods, allowing them to shrink the size of the gastrointestinal tract relative to body mass and to increase the brain mass instead.\nPaleolithic peoples suffered less famine and malnutrition than the Neolithic farming tribes that followed them. This was partly because Paleolithic hunter-gatherers accessed to a wider variety natural foods, which allowed them a more nutritious diet and a decreased risk of famine. Many of the famines experienced by Neolithic (and some modern) farmers were caused or amplified by their dependence on a small number of crops. It is thought that wild foods can have a significantly different nutritional profile than cultivated foods. The greater amount of meat obtained by hunting big game animals in Paleolithic diets than Neolithic diets may have also allowed Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to enjoy a more nutritious diet than Neolithic agriculturalists. It has been argued that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted in an increasing focus on a limited variety of foods, with meat likely taking a back seat to plants. It is also unlikely that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers were affected by modern diseases of affluence such as Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, because they ate mostly lean meats and plants and frequently engaged in intense physical activity, and because the average lifespan was shorter than the age of common-onset of these conditions.\nLarge-seeded legumes were part of the human diet long before the Neolithic agricultural revolution, as evident from archaeobotanical finds from the Mousterian layers of Kebara Cave, in Israel.&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.jas.2004.11.006\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence suggesting that Paleolithic societies were gathering wild cereals for food use at least as early as 30,000 years ago. However, seeds, such as grains and beans, were rarely eaten and never in large quantities on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=\"doi:10.1080/11026480510032043\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Recent archeological evidence also indicates that winemaking may have originated in the Paleolithic, when early humans drank the juice of naturally fermented wild grapes from animal-skin pouches. Paleolithic humans consumed animal organ meats, including the livers, kidneys and brains. Upper Paleolithic cultures appear to have had significant knowledge about plants and herbs and may have, albeit very rarely, practiced rudimentary forms of horticulture. In particular, bananas and tubers may have been cultivated as early as 25,000 BP in southeast Asia. Late Upper Paleolithic societies also appear to have occasionally practiced pastoralism and animal husbandry, presumably for dietary reasons. For instance, some European late Upper Paleolithic cultures domesticated and raised reindeer, presumably for their meat or milk, as early as 14,000 BP. Humans also probably consumed hallucinogenic plants during the Paleolithic period. The Australian Aborigines have been consuming a variety of native animal and plant foods, called bushfood, for an estimated 60,000 years, since the Middle Paleolithic.\nPeople during the Middle Paleolithic, such as the Neanderthals and Middle Paleolithic Homo sapiens in Africa, began to catch shellfish for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neanderthal sites in Italy about 110,000 years ago and Middle Paleolithic \"Homo sapiens\" sites at Pinnacle Point, in Africa around 164,000 BP.&lt;ref name=\"NYTIMES/10/08/07\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although fishing only became common during the Upper Paleolithic, fish have been part of human diets long before the dawn of the Upper Paleolithic and have certainly been consumed by humans since at least the Middle Paleolithic. For example, the Middle Paleolithic \"Homo sapiens\" in the region now occupied by the Democratic Republic of the Congo hunted large -long catfish with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90,000 years ago. The invention of fishing allowed some Upper Paleolithic and later hunter-gatherer societies to become sedentary or semi-nomadic, which altered their social structures. Example societies are the Lepenski Vir as well as some contemporary hunter-gatherers such as the Tlingit. In some instances (at least the Tlingit) they developed social stratification, slavery and complex social structures such as chiefdoms.\nAnthropologists such as Tim White suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, based on the large amount of \u201cbutchered human\" bones found in Neanderthal and other Lower/Middle Paleolithic sites. Cannibalism in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages. However, it may have been for religious reasons, and would coincide with the development of religious practices thought to have occurred during the Upper Paleolithic. Nonetheless, it remains possible that Paleolithic societies never practiced cannibalism, and that the damage to recovered human bones was either the result of ritual post-mortem bone cleaning or predation by carnivores such as saber tooth cats, lions and hyenas."}

This is usually above 8,000 metres (26,247 feet). Fourteen mountains have peaks that are in the death zone; Those mountains are in Asia, and they are part of the Himalaya and Karakoram.\n\"People are advised not to stay in the death zone for more than 16 to 20 hours\", media said; Shorter stays can also be deadly.\nMost of the 200+ climbers who have died on Mount Everest have died in the death zone. Due to the inverse relationship of atmospheric pressure to altitude, at the top of Mount Everest the average person takes in about 30% of the oxygen in the air that they would take in at sea level; a normal human person used to breathing air at sea level could only be there for a few minutes before they became unconscious. Most climbers have to carry oxygen bottles to be able to reach the top. Visitors become weak and have inability to think clearly and make decisions, especially under stress. Since helicopters also perform poorly in thin air, many bodies of dead visitors are left on the mountain.\nExamples of staying in the death zone for more than one night.\nIn 2008, Pemba Gyalje stayed in K2's Death Zone for 90 hours.\nBefore that, in 2006, climber Lincoln Hall, who was left for dead on Everest on May 25, 2006, managed to survive. Lack of oxygen in his blood made it easier for him to get frostbite. He also had headaches, nausea, vomiting and hallucinations. He said later this was caused by cerebral edema \u2013 or swelling of the brain. This is caused at high altitude when blood leaks into the brain itself and that can kill a person if the brain becomes too compressed. Hall was left for dead when his breathing and heartbeat stopped. He was found the next morning by a team of four led by U.S. climber Daniel Mazur. Hall was sitting cross-legged near a ten-thousand foot cliff's edge, without his gloves, hat, or oxygen, with his climbing suit unzipped. Mazur later reported that Hall seemed lucid, and his first words were, \"I imagine you're surprised to see me here.\" A massive rescue operation was assembled, and Hall was rescued. He survived for an additional seven years, speaking and writing books about his experiences on Everest, before his death in 2012 from mesothelioma."}

Smoot", "text": "George Fitzgerald Smoot III (born February 20, 1945) is an American professor of astrophysics and cosmology. In 2006 he won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on COBE with John C. Mather. That work made it possible to measure black holes and cosmic radiation much more exactly than was possible before.\nThis work gave new evidence for the big-bang idea that the universe was once a big explosion. This work was completed using the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite (COBE). The Nobel Prize committee said: \"the COBE-project can also be regarded as the starting point for cosmology as a precision science.\"\nProfessor Smoot works for the University of California, Berkeley Department of Physics. In 2003 he was awarded the Einstein Medal.\nEarly life.\nEducation.\nProfessor Smoot was born in Yukon, Florida. He went to Upper Arlington High School in Upper Arlington, Ohio until 1962. He studied mathematics for some time before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he was awarded two bachelor's degrees for mathematics and physics in 1966, and a Ph.D. in particle physics in 1970.\nSmoots cousin, Oliver R. Smoot, also studied at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and was made famous for the Smoot measurement of the Harvard Bridge between Cambridge and Boston. The \"Smoot\" length was marked in paint over 360 times on the bridge and is repainted there every year. Oliver later worked as the Chairman of the American National Standards Institute.\nEarly research.\nProfessor Smoot began to study cosmology, and went to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where he worked with Luis Walter Alvarez on the experiment HAPPE, a high up weather balloon for detecting antimatter in the upper atmosphere.\nHe then took up an interest in the microwaves in cosmic radiation which had been discovered by Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in 1964. This work gave new evidence of what the universe is made of. Some researchers thought that the universe was rotating, which would mean that temperature of microwaves would seem different when measured from different angles. With the help of Alvarez and Richard A. Muller, Professor Smoot developed a radiometer to measure the difference in temperature from two angles 60 degrees apart. The radiometer was put on top of a Lockheed U-2 plane, but the measurements seemed to show that the universe was not rotating. It did, however, detect another difference in the microwave temperature on one side of the sky. They called this a dipole pattern and a Doppler effect of the Earth's motion. A doppler effect happens because the Sun, and the Milky Way are moving at nearly 600 km/s. They think this is caused by gravity from the Great Attractor.\nCOBE.\nThe measurements from the radiometer showed that one side of the sky was different to the other but this was surprising because it was expected that many differences would be found all over the sky. Smoot was working on finding these smaller differences in the late 1970s when he gave NASA an idea to make a satellite with a detector that was similar to the one mounted on the Lockheed aeroplane. This detector would be much more powerful and it would not be affected by the atmosphere. NASA spent US$160\u00a0 million on the satellite and named it the COBE. The COBE satellite was delayed after the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed, but was launched successfully on November 18, 1989. After more than two years, on 21 April 1992, the COBE research team claimed that the satellite had detected the small differences they were looking for. This was very important in the study of the early universe. The study was \"evidence for the birth of the universe\". Professor Smoot said: \"If you're religious, it's like looking at God.\"\nMore than 1,000 researchers, engineers and other workers helped to make the COBE. John Mather was in control of the whole project and the experiments that made the COBE possible. George Smoot was in control of measuring the small differences in the temperature of the radiation.\nSmoot worked with the \"San Francisco Chronicle\"s journalist, Keay Davidson, to write a book called \"Wrinkles in Time\", all about the team's work. In the book \"The Very First Light\", John Mather and John Boslough write more of the COBE story. Mathers book says that Professor Smoot was giving news of COBE to the press before NASA did. This made problems between Smoot and Mather in the past.\nRecent work.\nAfter COBE, Smoot helped with another experiment with a stratospheric balloon called the MAXIMA experiment. This ballon took some better measurements than the COBE. Smoot has continued studying cosmic radiatin and now works on the third generation COBE satellite Planck. He is also working on the design of a Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP), a satellite which is to measure dark energy. He has also assisted in analyzing data from the Spitzer Space Telescope in connection with measuring far infrared background radiation."}

They began in Seattle, Washington, in 1984.\nSoundgarden helped create the sound of grunge music. This is a genre of alternative rock that first became popular in Seattle. They were first signed to a local record label Sub Pop. Later, they were the first grunge band to sign to a major label, A&amp;M Records, in 1988.\nSoundgarden became well-known with the 1994 album \"Superunknown\". It debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" charts. Two singles won Grammy Awards; \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Spoonman\". VH1 has ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".\nIn 1997, the band broke up because they could no longer agree on the sound of their musical future. The members worked on other projects for more than ten years. Soundgarden got back together in 2010. Two years later, they released their sixth studio album, \"King Animal\".\nOn May 17, 2017, frontman Chris Cornell was found dead in his Detroit hotel room, the night after a concert at the city's Fox Theatre. Police are treating it as suspected suicide. Soundgarden will almost certainly not continue.\nEarly band history.\nSoundgarden began in 1984. They first had three members: singer and drummer Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. The band named themselves after a wind-channeling pipe sculpture, \"A Sound Garden\". The art work is in Magnuson Park, in Seattle.\nAt first, Cornell played drums while singing, but in 1985 the band hired Scott Sundquist so that Cornell could just sing. The band's first recordings were three songs on a compilation album for C/Z Records named \"Deep Six\". Also appearing on the album were early grunge artists Green River, Skin Yard, Malfunkshun, The U-Men and the Melvins. In 1986, Sundquist left the band. He was replaced by Matt Cameron, who had been the drummer for Skin Yard.\nA Seattle radio staion DJ, Jonathan Poneman, liked Soundgarden after seeing them perform. He later said, \"I saw this band that was everything rock music should be\". Poneman offered to pay for a record to be made by the band. Teaming up with Bruce Pavitt, Poneman also contributed $20,000 to the financially struggling Sub Pop. This helped turn Sup Pop into a popular, successful record label that attracted more success with grunge bands. Sub Pop then released Soundgarden's \"Screaming Life\" EP in 1987, and the \"Fopp\" EP in 1988. A combination of the two was issued as \"Screaming Life/Fopp\" in 1990.\nThough major labels were asking Soundgarden to sign with them, in 1988 the band chose a small independent label, SST Records. SST released their debut album, \"Ultramega OK\". The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1990.\nThe band's first music video, \"Flower\", became popular; airing regularly on MTV's \"120 Minutes\". In 1989, Soundgarden promoted \"Ultramega OK\" with a tour of the United States and then went to Europe. This was their first overseas tour.\nMajor labels.\nIn 1989, Soundgarden released their first album for a major label, A&amp;M Records. \"Louder Than Love\" became the band's first to chart on the \"Billboard\" 200. It reached number 108 on the chart in 1990. The band supported the album with tours of North America and Europe.\nA month before touring for \"Louder Than Love\" began, bassist Hiro Yamamoto left to go back to college. Yamamoto was unhappy because he felt he was not important enough to the band. Former Nirvana bassist Jason Everman took his place for the tour. Everman was fired immediately after Soundgarden got back from Europe in mid-1990. An EP \"Loudest Love\" and the video compilation \"Louder Than Live\", were both released in 1990. The video shows five live tracks made during the \"Louder Than Love\" tour.\nBadmotorfinger: 1990\u20131993.\nBassist Ben Shepherd joined Soundgarden in 1990. Their next album, \"Badmotorfinger\" was released in 1991. It had some success, reaching number 39 on the album charts. But it got less attention because of the surprise success of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\", released the same month as Badmotorfinger. Two singles got popular airplay on alternative radio stations and MTV.\nThe first single from \"Badmotorfinger\", \"Jesus Christ Pose\", got negative attention when MTV banned its music video in 1991. Many listeners were outraged by the song and its video, calling it anti-Christian. The band received death threats while on tour in the United Kingdom in support of the album. \"Badmotorfinger\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992.\nAfter a tour of North America in 1991, the band opened for Guns N' Roses in North America on the band's \"Use Your Illusion Tour\". After several tours to promote the album, they rejoined Guns N' Roses in the summer of 1992 in Europe as part of the Use Your Illusion Tour with another opening act, Faith No More. The band took part in the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and Ministry.\nThe band later released a video compilation \"Motorvision\". It was made in 1992 at the Paramount Theatre. Also that year, they appeared in the movie \"Singles\". They were show performing \"Birth Ritual\". The song appeared on the soundtrack, as did a Chris Cornell solo song, \"Seasons\".\nSuperunknown: 1994\u20131995.\nSoundgarden released \"Superunknown\" in 1994. It became the band's best-selling album, partly because of the popular singles \"Black Hole Sun\", \"Spoonman\", \"My Wave\", and \"Fell on Black Days\". Upon its release in March 1994, \"Superunknown\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart.\nThe lyrics of the songs were dark and sad; much of them seem to be talking about substance abuse, suicide, and depression. Reviewer J.D. Considine of \"Rolling Stone\" said \"Superunknown\" \"demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career.\" He also stated, \"At its best, \"Superunknown\" offers a more harrowing depiction of alienation and despair than anything on \"In Utero\".\"\nThe music video for \"Black Hole Sun\" received the MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Rock Video|Best Metal/Hard Rock Video\" award in 1994. Soundgarden won two Grammy Awards in 1995; \"Black Hole Sun\" received the award for Best Hard Rock Performance and \"Spoonman\" received the award for Best Metal Performance.\nDown on the Upside: 1996\u20131997.\nAfter a worldwide tour to promote \"Superunknown\", the band members began working on what would become their last studio album for more than 15 years. It was released in 1996. Four singles were released from the album: \"Pretty Noose\", \"Blow Up the Outside World\", \"Burden in My Hand\", and \"Ty Cobb\".\nThe music was less heavy metal and grunge sounding than the group's previous albums. The band members said that they wanted to experiment with other sounds. In a review, David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said, \"Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric.\" However, the writing and recording of the album was stressful for the group. Thayil and Cornell seemed to not agree on a change from the heavy guitar riffs that had become the band's trademark. The album got favorable reviews, but did not sell as well as \"Superunknown\".\nThe band played on the 1996 Lollapalooza tour with Metallica, who had asked for them to appear. After Lollapalooza, the band left for a world tour. Tensions continued to increase during the tour. When asked if the band hated touring, Cornell said, \"We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring.\" At the tour's final stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass guitar into the air in frustration after his equipment failed. He then stormed off the stage. The band then also left the stage, but Cornell returned to play a solo as an encore.\nBreakup and reunion.\nOn April 9, 1997, the band announced they were breaking up. Thayil said, \"It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude over the course of the previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction.\" A best-of album named \"A-Sides\", was released in November 1997 through A&amp;M Records.\nAfter almost 13 years, on January 1, 2010, Chris Cornell wrote on his Twitter, \"The 12-year break is over and school is back in session. Sign up now. Knights of the Soundtable ride again!\" The message linked to a website for fans to enter their e-mail addresses to get updates on the reunion."}

While not kings, these men were respected and they sometimes decided cases. That is why they were called Judges. One of the Judges was Samson who was a very strong man. He fought against the Philistines. After his girl friend, Delilah, tricked him by cutting his hair, he was made a slave. At his death, he destroyed many enemies by pulling down a building on them. Gideon was another famous judge. He defeated an army of Midianites with only 300 men. Another famous judge was Deborah, possible the most powerful woman in the Bible. She was a military, civil and religious leader. \nIn the book, there is a pattern which repeats. The people turn from God, and he allows their enemies to harm them. Then they pray to God. He sends them a new judge. This judge helps the people and defeats their enemies. The people are happy for a time, but soon they again turn from God. The cycle repeats itself. "}

The meaning of the word is mainly used for people of Sub-Saharan African descent, but also includes certain groups in Oceania and Southeast Asia.\nBlack people in the Americas.\nUnited States.\nBlack people in the United States are called \"African Americans\". Before 1860, many Africans were brought to the United States in the European slave trade by white people. Later, other Africans came out of their free will. Discrimination against African Americans is a big problem. Black Lives Matter is a movement fighting against racism.\nIn 2010, the cities with the largest numbers of African Americans were Detroit (670,000 black inhabitants) and Memphis (607,000 black inhabitants). \nIn 2008, Barack Obama became the first African American president of the United States. In 2021, Kamala Harris became the first African American to be the Vice President of the United States.\nSome blacks in the United States are Hispanic, Caribbean or African because of immigration. Most recent African immigrants are refugees from East Africa such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia etc. or high-skilled immigrants from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa.\nMost non-Hispanic blacks in the United States live in the South. States with a large black population are Texas, Georgia, Florida, New York, North Carolina, California, Maryland, Illinois, Virginia and Louisiana.\nLatin America.\nWhite men who were Spanish colonizers shipped African slaves to Latin American countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Cuba, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic because of the decline of Native Americans from smallpox and disease. Native Americans were initially slaves but white Europeans turned to Africans because of the mass decline of the Native American population. Many Mestizos and Hispanics have African DNA from the slave trade because of the race mixing with white people, African slaves and Native Americans. Many African ex-slaves in Latin America are mixed race and have Native American and Spanish ancestry. Racial whitening was a policy in Brazil to turn African slaves white in the future and to improve the uncivilized, undesirable African race. \"Mestizaje\" in Latin America by the Spanish was similar to the racial whitening that happened in Brazil.\nCaribbean.\nBlack slaves were shipped to various Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, Haiti, The Bahamas, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Europeans, mostly the British, the Dutch and the French brought Africans to the Caribbean to work on crops like coffee, sugar, cocoa, cotton and indigo.\nCanada.\nThere were 1.2 million black people living in Canada in 2016.\nBlack people in other countries.\nGermany.\nThere were about 1 million black people living in Germany in 2020.\nIndia and Pakistan.\nIn India and Pakistan there are Siddi people. Their ancestors came from East Africa.\nSouth Africa.\nDuring apartheid people in South Africa were classified into four main races: Black, White, Asian (mostly Indian) and Coloured. Under apartheid black people were treated the most badly. Coloured people were treated slightly less badly. In South Africa, Chinese people who lived there during apartheid are classed as black. About 80% of people in South Africa are Black African. The income of the average white South African household is six times as much as that of the average Black South African household.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBlack people in the United Kingdom are defined by terms used by the Office for National Statistics. They make up 3.3% of the people in the UK. Of course, these terms may or may not be used in everyday life."}

It is one of the shortest books in both the Jewish and Christian holy books, consisting of only four chapters. It is unknown who wrote the book. Some think that it was written by Samuel, but there is no evidence for that. \nAccording to many scholars, this book was originally part of the Book of Judges, and was later taken from that book and made independent. It was probably written around 900 BC.\nStory of Ruth.\nThe book tells the story of the family of Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and their sons Mahlon and Chilion. Because of a famine, they were forced to leave Bethlehem and go to the land of Moab. Once there, Elimelech died, and his sons married two Moabite women. Mahlon married Ruth, and Chilion married Orpah. After some time there, Mahlon and Chilion both died.\nNaomi was forced to return home because her husband and sons were dead. She then told Ruth and Orpah to return home to their families and find new husbands. Orpah returned home but Ruth promised she would follow Naomi wherever she went. Ruth's pledge to Naomi is found in chapter 1 verses 16 and 17. \" But Ruth said, \"Do not press me to leave you or to turn back from following you! Where you go, I will go; where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die, I will die\u2014 there will I be buried. May the Lord do thus and so to me, and more as well, if even death parts me from you!\"\" Although originally made by a daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law, a form of this pledge is sometimes included in wedding services. \nThey returned to their home and Ruth decided she would go into the fields to pick up grain the wealthy people would drop on the ground (a common practice in that time). A kind man named Boaz, who was the owner of the field, noticed her and her beauty. He also learned that she had chosen to follow the God of Israel and that she was caring for her widowed mother-in-law. He told his workers to drop extra grain for her. When she went home to tell her mother-in-law how much she received, they found out that Boaz was a close relative of theirs. Under Jewish law, this gave Ruth the right to marry Boaz, if Boaz bought the land formerly owned by Ruth's husband.\nAfter an even closer relative said he would not buy the land and marry her, Boaz and Ruth were happily married. She would bear him a son named Obed, who was the father of Jesse, who was the father of David, who was, according to the New Testament, the ancestor of Jesus."}
{"id": "102424", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102424", "title": "Mesolithic", "text": "The Mesolithic was a period in the development of human technology between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods of the Stone Age.\nIn the Palaeolithic, people were pure hunter-gatherers. In the Neolithic they were farmers in settlements with domesticated animals and wheat, with over 100 kinds of tools and with pottery. The Mesolithic was a transitional period between the two. It happened at different times in different places. Mesolithic tools are small tools produced by chipping, and are hunter-gatherer tools, often arrowheads and points. Neolithic tools are often polished and far more varied. They are tools of more settled societies with some agriculture.\nThe term 'Mesolithic' was introduced by Hodder Westrop in 1877, though the idea had been used earlier. It was not much used until V. Gordon Childe popularized it in his book \"The dawn of Europe\" (1947). There is another term, 'Epipalaeolithic', which is sometimes used instead.\nDistinctive features.\nThe type of tool is the diagnostic factor. The Mesolithic featured devices made with small chipped stone tools. The Neolithic mainly abandoned this mode in favor of polished, not chipped, stone tools.\nThe Mesolithic culture can be set apart from that of the Palaeolithic in these ways:\nThe Fertile Crescent.\nThe Fertile Crescent was the first part of the world to move out of the Palaeolithic.\nIn some areas, such as the Near East, agriculture was already underway by the end of the Pleistocene, and there the Mesolithic is short. In areas with limited influence of ice age, the term \"Epipaleolithic\" is sometimes preferred.\nRegions that experienced greater environmental effects as the last ice age ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era. This lasted millennia. In Northern Europe, societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the marshlands. Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours which are preserved in characteristic finds. These conditions also delayed the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 BC (6,000 before present) in northern Europe.\nMesolithic men in Europe.\nGenetic research has been done on the skeleton of a 7,000-year-old man from north-west Spain. It shows he had blue eyes and a dark skin. The analysis showed that he had ancestral alleles in several skin pigmentation genes. This means he had dark hair and brown skin.\nResearchers were surprised because they thought that European populations evolved light skin quite quickly. In lower latitudes dark skin protects from UV rays in sunlight. In northern latitudes this is not such a problem, but the supply of vitamin D is a problem. Vitamin D is synthesised by the action of sunlight on skin. Therefore, it is an advantage in much of Europe to have a light skin.\nEarlier research was done on data using 2,196 samples from 185 diverse populations. It showed that at least three ancestral groups contributed to present-day Europeans."}

It was a gradual change from nomadic hunting and gathering communities to agriculture and settlement. It changed the way of life of the communities which made the change. It occurred in different prehistoric human societies at different times. Many societies changed 9\u20137 thousand years ago\nThe term refers to the general time period over which these developments took place. It also applies to the changes which took place: the adoption of early agriculture techniques, crop cultivation, and the domestication of animals.\nThe Neolithic revolution is important for developments in social organization and technology.\nThe Neolithic revolution led to people living in permanent or semi-permanent settlements. Because of this fewer people led a nomadic lifestyle. To be able to know who the crops grown belonged to, the concept of land ownership was developed. The natural environment was changed, population sizes grew, and people ate more vegetable and cereal foods in their diet. Hierarchies developed in society. Grain was stored, and could be traded. Surplus production from good crop yields helped societies survive bad years.\nGeneral process.\nWith domesticated animals such as dogs, goats, sheep, and cattle, and crops, human society changed. Now, having crops and livestock, they no longer needed to move around. They could build better settlements. Their diet also changed. It included more oats and vegetables. People also started to keep and manage food: it was not advisable to eat all grain seeds, because then there would be no seeds left to plant the next year. Also, there were surplus in some years and that could be traded for other goods with other peoples.\nThese changes happened independently in several parts of the world. They did not happen in the same order. The earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery. It is still unclear to what extent plants were domesticated in Britain, or if permanently settled communities existed at all. Early Japanese societies used pottery \"before\" developing agriculture.\nIn the Paleolithic there were more than one human species, but only the modern human reached the Mesolithic and Neolithic.\nVere Gordon Childe gave the name \"Neolithic Revolution\" to this process in the 1920s. He thought that it was as important as the Industrial Revolution (which happened in the 18th and 19th century).\nTheories about the Neolithic revolution.\nThere are different theories why this transition could have happened:\nReasons why it happened.\nAccording to Harland, there are three main reasons why the Neolithic revolution happened:"}

It began with \"Super Mario Kart\" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. To date, there are four \"Mario Kart\" games on home consoles, three portable games, and three Namco co-developed arcade games, making a total of twelve. The latest game for the series is.\nGameplay.\nIn the \"Mario Kart\" series, players compete in go-kart races, controlling one of a selection of characters from the \"Mario\" franchise. Up to eight participants can compete in each race, with the exception of \"Mario Kart Wii\", which holds twelve. One of the features of the series is the use of various power-up items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include mushrooms to give players a speed boost, Koopa Shells to be thrown at opponents, and banana peels that can be laid on the track as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is random and often influenced by the player's position in the race. For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items while the leader will only receive small defensive items. This gameplay mechanic\u2013called \"rubber banding\"\u2013 allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player no matter how far ahead they are. As the series has progresses, each new title has introduced new elements in order to keep the gameplay fresh. Changes typically include new items, new stages, and new methods of obtaining speed boosts, but most games have also featured a new play mechanic as well. Changes new titles have brought to the series include: \"Mario Kart 64\" introducing 4-player racing and bringing the series into the third dimension, \"'s\" introducing a partner system and the Double Dash!!, \"Mario Kart Wii's\" use of motorbikes and twelve participants per race, and the newest entry into the franchise, \"Mario Kart 7\", featuring hang gliders, submarines and a new first-person perspective as well as customizing karts.\nCourses.\nMany course themes are repeated throughout the series. For example, most games have featured a circuit course, a desert course, a city or highway course with traffic, some form of a beach course, a stadium course, a jungle course, an ice or snow course, Bowser's Castle and Rainbow Road. Each game in the series includes 16 original courses, with the exception of \"Super Mario Kart\" and \"Super Circuit\", which holds 20. Most races have three laps, while some games have more or less. There are also three to six original battle arenas in each game, designed exclusively for Battle mode. So far, there are 120 original courses and 30 original arenas spread throughout these seven games. Additionally, there are 48 Retro courses and 10 Retro arenas. These consist of older material recreated for newer games.\nModes of play.\nEach \"Mario Kart\" game features a variety of different modes. The following modes recur most often in the series:\nOther appearances.\nSeveral \"Mario Kart\"-related items appear in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, with \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" in particular featuring a stage based on one of \"Mario Kart DS\"'s courses. Certain courses from the series have also appeared in \"F-Zero X\", \"Itadaki Street DS\", \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\", \"Fortune Street\" and \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\". Various items from the series can also be seen in games such as \"Nintendogs\" and \"Animal Crossing\".\nMerchandise.\n\"Mario Kart\" has had a range of merchandise released. This includes a Scalextric style \"Mario Kart DS\" Figure-8-Circuit. It comes with Mario and Donkey Kong figures, while a Wario and a Luigi are available separately. It also includes CD soundtracks. A line of remote-controlled karts are available in stores. Each kart has a Game Boy Advance-shaped controller. It features forward driving and rotates when put in reverse, instead of steering. The current line-up of karts is Mario, Donkey Kong and Yoshi. There are three large karts that depict the same trio. These karts are controlled by a GameCube controller shape.

He was born in Winnipeg. He helped to re-{popularize magic shows, during his heyday (most popular and successful period) in the 1970s.\nHenning's approach to magic and performing was different from earlier magicians. While magicians usually performed in black formal wear, Henning wore colorful clothes. He also studied psychology in college, to know how the human mind works.\nHenning is credited by many for the resurgence of the public's interest in magic, thanks to his breakthroug Broadway show, \"The Magic Show,\" which opened in 1974 and ran for almost five years. This was followed by eight television specials on NBC (the first of which remains the most watched magic television special in history, with over fifty million viewers). In 1982, he appeared in another Broadway show, \"Merlin\", which ran for seven months. Though the magic in Merlin was met with accolades, critics trounced the show's book and music.\nHenning was a spokesperson for Polaroid, TWA, Minolta and Chrysler.\nHe was a student of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and used transcendental meditation to help him focus and to relax. He tried to help the Maharishi open a theme park, called Vedaland. Henning also ran for public office in Canada, but lost the election. \nHenning died in 2000 of liver cancer in Los Angeles. Instead of normal medical treatments, he tried to cure himself through natural remedies and diet, but this did not work. After his death, Henning's widow kept the Vedaland campaign going.\nThe first and only written biography of Doug Henning, \"Spellbound: The Wonder-filled Life of Doug Henning\" was published in 2009 (John Harrison, BoxOffice Books, New York.)"}

Following Operation Ivy's breakup, Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman decided to form a new band, and started a hardcore punk group called Generator, which quickly broke up. They also started two other ska influenced bands, Downfall and Dance Hall Crashers, but moved on quickly from both. In 1991, after Armstrong and Freeman recruited drummer Brett Reed, Rancid officially became Rancid.\nRancid's first official recorded release was a 1992 self-titled EP, which is currently out of print, for Operation Ivy's old label Lookout! Records. Also during 1992, shortly after releasing this, Rancid were signed to Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz's label, Epitaph Records, and finally released their first album in 1993, which is also self-titled. Prior to its release, the band was looking for a second guitarist and Armstrong asked former UK Subs guitarist Lars Frederiksen to be Rancid's second guitarist, but he immediately turned down the request. However, after Billie Joe Armstrong (who was in Green Day at the time) declined, Frederiksen changed his mind and decided to join Rancid.\nFrederiksen was present on Rancid's second album, \"Let's Go\", which was released in 1994 and spawned the radio hit \"Salvation\". That year their label-mates, The Offspring, experienced a huge success with their album \"Smash\". The Offspring took Rancid on tour with them, and helped \"Let's Go\" make it to #97 on Billboard's Heatseekers and Billboard 200 charts, respectively. With the success of the album Rancid were pursued by several major labels, including Madonna's Maverick Records, but the band eventually turned down the idea of signing to a different label and decided to just stay on Epitaph.\nRancid's popularity grew in 1995 with their third album, \"...And Out Come the Wolves\", which quickly surpassed \"Let's Go\" in terms of success. The critically-acclaimed album, also the band's most successful, produced three singles, \"Roots Radicals\", \"Time Bomb\", and \"Ruby Soho\", which all charted on the North American Billboard Modern Rock Tracks, and the band performed two of these songs on \"Saturday Night Live\". \"...And Out Come the Wolves\" was certified gold by the RIAA on January 22, 1996. It was also certified platinum on September 23, 2004.\nSince the release of \"...And Out Come the Wolves\", Rancid would became one of the most important punk bands of the 1990s, along with ALL, Bad Religion, Face to Face, Green Day, Guttermouth, Lagwagon, NOFX, The Offspring, Pennywise, Social Distortion (the latter of which Freeman would eventually join and later leave), The Vandals, and many others."}

It says that as speed of the fluid increases, pressure decreases. The photo on the right shows this happening. The air in the wide part of the tube has a higher static pressure than the thin part. For a steady flow, the amount of fluid entering the pipe must equal the amount leaving the pipe, so the fluid speed in the thin part must increase. \nWhen a force acts over an area, it is called \"pressure\". A higher pressure pushes (accelerates) fluid toward lower pressure. So any change in a fluid's speed must be matched by a change in pressure (force). Bernoulli saw that while the fluid moved more quickly in the smaller part of the tube, the pressure became less. Please note that this refers to changes in speed and pressure along a single path of flow and does not apply to two different flows at different speeds.\nThe full version of Bernoulli's principle includes both the work by the pressure and by the changes in potential energy from changes in height. In this form, the principle says the total of the pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy is a constant. (Bernoulli does not consider viscosity or compressibility.)"}

The book contains some important teaching and instructions in each of these respective Religions. While some verses teach duty to God, many can be seen as good advice. Even nonreligious persons may find this advice to be useful. \nAuthor.\nMost scholars believe that Solomon was the writer of at least part of the book. Other authors are mentioned as well, but these references are missing in the Greek Septuagint. The Septuagint sees King Solomon as the author of the whole Book of Proverbs. In the Middle Ages, scholars thought the Vulgate was a more faithful rendering of 30:1 and 31:1. In their eyes the words \"Agur\" and \"Lamuel\" were only other names for Solomon.\nWhen it was Written.\nDates for the writing of the book are unclear. Because of suggested authorship of Solomon, and the workings of Hezekiah's men, there are some dates that can be worked with. However, there are not enough to give specific timing to the completion of the book, though it could have been as late as third century BC\nContent.\nThe first part of the book (Chapters 1-10) is mainly praise for Wisdom. Wisdom is personified as a woman. This does not mean that an actual person is spoken of. Christians believe that Jesus is the person who most shows the wisdom of God. (Colossians 2:3). Some of the attributes of Jesus are said to be found in the \"Wisdom\" of the Book of Proverbs. This first section also advises young men not to go to prostitutes. \nThe center part of the book (Chapters 10-29) contains many \"stand alone\" verses. These are in the form of Hebrew Poetry. Each verse has two parts. The second part may give the opposite side of some advice, such as \"Hard workers get rich, lazy people become poor\". In other cases the two halves repeat the same idea again, but in different words. \nThe final chapter is a famous poem of praise to \"a virtuous woman\". This chapter was from \"King Lemuel\", but was taught him by his mother. It is one of the few parts of the Bible which has a female author. "}

When writing about plays from James's reign, scholars and critics sometimes use the term Jacobean drama; plays from Charles I's reign are called Caroline drama. (These names come from the Latin forms of the two kings' names, \"Jacobus\" for James and \"Carolus\" for Charles.) But for the subject as a whole, terms like English Renaissance drama or theatre are more accurate.\nThe year 1576 was a key date in this subject, since that is when the first permanent theatre building was built in London. It was called simply The Theatre, because it was the only place of its kind in England at the time. Before 1576, plays were acted in public halls and large houses, and in inns and public squares and courtyards and other open spaces, by troops of actors that mostly travelled around the countryside between cities and towns. Once the actors had a permanent place to act plays, they could develop their art without the constant need to travel. The Theatre was followed by other theatres in the London area; there were the Curtain, The Rose, the Swan, the Globe, and others too. More plays were written by more playwrights to fill these theatres.\nPlaywrights worked in both the classic types of drama, tragedy and comedy. They also began their own type of history play, mainly about earlier English kings and the events of their reigns. Shakespeare's \"Richard III\" and Marlowe's \"Edward II\" are two examples of this type of English history play. Plays were often written in poetry; early plays were mainly in rhymed verse, though as time passed playwrights came to prefer unrhymed blank verse. Prose was also used in some plays, mostly for comedy.\nEnglish Renaissance drama grew and developed until 1642, when it suddenly stopped. In the early years of the English Civil War, the Puritans who were fighting King Charles gained control of London and the region around it. The Puritans were against play-acting; they thought it was sinful and immoral. On September 2, 1642, the Puritans forced the London theatres to close, and to stay closed for most of the time until 1660. Then the English Restoration brought a new king, Charles II, who let the theatres re-open. In the 18-year gap between 1642 and 1660, English society had changed a good deal, and a new style of drama rose up in the Restoration era; it is usually called Restoration drama or Restoration theatre."}

An example from William Wordsworth's poem \"Michael\" shows the lack of rhyme and the strict meter in blank verse \u2013 each line sticks fairly closely to the pattern of iambic pentameter:\nMany critics judge blank verse to be better than rhyme for serious subjects, and many poets have used blank verse for their most important works. Shakespeare used rhyme in his early plays, but in his more mature works like \"Hamlet\" he preferred blank verse. John Milton wrote \"Paradise Lost\" in blank verse, including a note at the beginning of the poem saying that rhyming poetry was used to disguise badly written poems, Lord Tennyson used it for \"Idylles of the King\", and Wordsworth used it for \"The Prelude\" and \"The Excursion\". John Keats used rhyme in his \"Endymion\", his first try at a major poem; for his second attempt, \"Hyperion\", he switched to blank verse. The longest poems in English literature are written in blank verse, for example \"The Fall of Nineveh\" by Edwin Atherstone or \"King Alfred\" by John Fitchett. This last is about 130 000 lines long.\nMany 20th century poets gave up both rhyme and the strict meter of blank verse to write free verse.\nBibliography.\nJoseph Berg Esenwein, Mary Eleanor Roberts, \"Art of Versification\".

Males were black with a pale stripe down the spine, while females and calves were reddish (these colours are still found in a few domesticated cattle breeds, such as Jersey cattle).

General Stoneman's plan was to destroy anything that might benefit the Southern war effort and was approved by his commanding officers on December 6, 1864.\nThe Confederates managed to hold the key positions on the battlefield against numerous Union charges. Eventually, the Confederates ran short of ammunition and were forced to withdraw. The total casualties for this battle were 274, relatively low for a battle during the Civil War.\nAfter the battle, the Union expedition set out to destroy the salt mines, lead works, and anything else in the area that could be of benefit to the Confederates.\nLocation.\nThe town of Marion is in southwest Virginia on the Middle Fork of the Holston River in Smyth County, Virginia. It was about half way between the salt works at Saltville and the lead mines near Wytheville. Since it is near the Mason\u2013Dixon line, many of the town's families were divided and fought on opposing sides. Until the winter of 1864, the town of Marion had been protected from fighting by the mountains and geographic location.\nBackground.\nUnion army.\nProposition.\nMajor General George Stoneman, commander of the Union Army in Kentucky and Tennessee, proposed another expedition into southwest Virginia to destroy all facilities and supplies of benefit to the Confederate war effort. This gained the approval of Major General John Schofield on December 6, 1864.\nPreparations.\nStoneman would use troops under General Alvan Gillem and those commanded by General Stephen Burbridge\u2014including the 5th and the 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry who had participated in the failed previous attempt to destroy the salt works at the first Battle of Saltville. Stoneman ordered Burbridge to bring his army of 4,200 men through the Cumberland Gap to join Stoneman and General Gillem at Knoxville, Tennessee where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1,500 men. Stoneman did not reveal the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates until three days after it had departed Knoxville on December 10. On December 12, Stoneman's force flanked and forced back Confederate General Basil Duke's cavalry at Rogersville, Tennessee. The Federals defeated and scattered the Confederates the next day at Kingsport, Tennessee. There General Gillem captured 84 prisoners, including Col. Richard C. Morgan and the brigade's supply train.\nOn the 14th, the Union army began to push Duke's cavalry back toward Abingdon, Virginia. The next day, Stoneman and his cavalry went into camp at Glade Spring, Virginia, which was about west of Marion. On December 16, Stoneman's cavalry rode toward Marion, destroying infrastructure and public buildings along their path.\nConfederate army.\nThe opposing force of General Stoneman was the army of Major General John C. Breckinridge, who was the commander of the Department of Southwest Virginia. Breckinridge's command consisted of approximately 1,000 regular troops with another 500 militia reserves. Most of the army had been transferred to the Army of Northern Virginia to help in the defense of Richmond.\nPreparations.\nBreckinridge's army consisted of Colonel Henry Giltner's brigade, (which was formed from the soldiers of the 4th Kentucky Cavalry and the 10th Kentucky Cavalry); the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles (later renamed to the 13th Kentucky Cavalry), and the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry. Breckinridge's army also included General Basil Duke's cavalry, General George Cosby's cavalry and Colonel Vincent Witcher and his 34th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry.\nOn the night of December 16, General Breckinridge and his troops moved out of Saltville, Virginia in an effort to stop Stoneman. Taking the regular troops with him, Breckinridge left Colonel Robert Preston in charge of the 500 militia men to defend the salt works. General Breckinridge sent Witcher and his men of the 34th on ahead of his main force and ordered them to harass the Union army.\nAt about 3\u00a0a.m. (Local Time), Breckinridge and his small army began to travel across Walkers Mountain. In the last few days before the march, 4\" of rain fell, making travel difficult across the muddy roads. At 4:00\u00a0a.m. (Local Time), they reached the main road near Seven Mile Ford, Virginia where Breckinridge waited for daylight before continuing.\nBattle.\nAdvance.\nAround noon of December 17, 1864, Breckinridge's men mounted their horses rode toward Marion. Meanwhile, General Stoneman sent some of his Tennessee regiments to Wytheville, Virginia to destroy anything that looked valuable. Stoneman also sent two regiments of cavalry to destroy the lead mines and smelting facilities that were about ten miles (16\u00a0km) from Wytheville.\nStoneman and Burbridge continued on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men. Burbridge's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher's small regiment, who stopped just so they could fire a volley into the Union cavalry. They then continued to retreat toward Marion. Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they were coming to join them at Marion.\nFirst day.\nGeneral Breckinridge's front regiment was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles, under the command of Colonel Benjamin Caudill. Caudill's men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry, causing several casualties. As the rest of Breckinridge's troops began to arrive on the scene, General Stoneman's men secured the high hill overlooking the river. Breckinridge observed that these hills were the best defensive positions in the area; following which he ordered the men of the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles to charge up the hill and drive out the Union army. The rest of Giltner's Brigade also joined in the charge, routing the Union soldiers. The result of the charge ended in Confederate favor, and the Confederates gained control of the hill.\nBurbridge then began to form his men up in columns to counterattack the Rebel defenses. As soon as the men were in position, he ordered all columns to charge in unison. After the signal, the Union Army surged forward. The first Confederate volley of shots depleted the Union forces considerably. Even after the volley, the Rebel forces were still vastly outnumbered. Confederate Artillery commander Major Richard Page and his battery of four 10-pounder Parrott rifles began to fire, attempting to slow the charge. The overwhelming fire forced the Union soldiers to fall back with many casualties.\nThe Union officers then reorganized their men and with a yell of their own, charged again. Like the previous charge, this charge also was repelled. One more charge occurred that day. Courageously, the men formed and prepared to face the withering fire that they knew would come from the breast works in their front. For the final time that day, the Union army charged into Confederate fire with the same results as the previous charges. The Rebels had held on to their position during the first day of battle.\nBreckinridge ordered his men to move forward and build new breastworks. These new defensive positions placed the two armies less than one hundred fifty yards apart. During the night, one Union officer was ordered to take positions at the covered bridge near the river. He and 75 men took up positions in and around the covered bridge. This was the only advance of that night by the Union army.\nSecond day.\nThe Union army that was positioned at the covered bridge fired the first few volleys at the rebels to harass their front positions. General Burbridge attacked just as the fog lifted. To entertain themselves, soldiers from both armies began to hurl insults across the fields between them. About midmorning Burbridge decided that the light rain probably would not stop falling any time soon and had his officers prepare to commence the battle.\nBoth armies yet again raised their battle cries. Columns of Union men charged across the fields into the same fire they had received the day before. A combination of the colored and the white troops managed to push the 4th Kentucky Infantry and General Cosby's positions back. Cosby rallied his men and counterattacked, retaking their breastworks. The Union soldiers that had taken positions at the covered bridge the night before began to take pressure from the 4th Kentucky in their front. They realized their location was not safe one and some began to try to run back to the Union lines. As these men would attempt to retreat from their positions at the bridge, the rebels of the would pick most of them off. The remaining Union soldiers at the bridge decided to wait out the battle. Later in the day General Burbridge ordered one of his regiments to charge across the bridge on horseback to relieve the pressure on the trapped men. The regiment solely received a few casualties and then retreated.\nOn the far right, General Duke was being pressed hard by the heavy columns of attacking soldiers. Seeing this, Colonel Giltner sent his regiment to reinforce Duke. Before the 2nd arrived, Duke and his men counterattacked the Union line and routed it. Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union's extreme left flank. This Union colored regiment was also completely routed.\nBurbridge and his men then went into a disorderly retreat. The confederate rail breastworks had held, but the holding of the line had resulted in the use of a huge amount of ammunition. Each Rebel defender had shot at least seventy-five rounds, and some having fired as many as a hundred shots. The Union army then ordered another charge with a large cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate army had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.\nAftermath.\nBreckinridge ordered his field officers to make an inspection of the troops and to report back with the condition of his army. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his army to the point that he could judged that he could no longer hold back the Union army at the front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also running low; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's army at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in time.\nBreckinridge then ordered his men to retreat from the battlefield. Though the men faced miserable conditions, they were confident they could hold the field the next day. Angrily they obeyed orders and silently began to move out with Colonel Ben Caudill and his Mounted Rifles leading the way.\nOutcome.\nThe battle at Marion was a Union victory. The vastly outnumbered Rebels had inflicted moderate casualties and slowed the advance on Saltville, but were unable to stop it. Finding their own path to Saltville's defenses blocked, Breckinridge and his men retreated further south, while the Union raiders advanced. Saltville would fall to a night attack on December 20 - December 21 and the salt works would be destroyed by the Union army.\nThe damage to the leadmines near Wytheville would keep them out of production for three months, and then only partial production would be possible. Salt production would not be resumed for over a month. All railroad locomotives, cars, depots and bridges in the vicinity had been destroyed by the raid. General Stoneman claimed to have captured 34 officers and 845 enlisted men during the raid."}

Somewhere between 750,000 and 1.2 million soldiers served the Confederacy in one form or another. The exact numbers are not known because of incomplete and destroyed records. Although it won many battles the Confederate Army lost the war. It could not overcome the Union army's larger numbers and better resources. On April 9, 1865, General Robert E. Lee surrendered what was left of the Army of Northern Virginia to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. While his army was only a part of the total Confederate army, his surrender marked the end of the Confederacy. On June 23, 1865, Georgia's Stand Watie became the last Confederate general to surrender.\nMakeup.\nMuch of the design of the Confederate States Army was based on the structure and customs of the U.S. Army. Both armies were mainly infantry, cavalry and artillery units. While the structure of the two armies was very similar, the number of men in each unit could be different. Many Confederate officers were graduates of West Point just like Union officers. Regiments were usually numbered and named for the state where they were first organized and where most of the soldiers came from. Brigades were usually named after their commanders (past or present). For example, the Stonewall Brigade was named for its commanding general, Stonewall Jackson.\nThe Confederate Army had three parts; the Army of the Confederate States of America (ACSA, smallest but intended to be the permanent, regular army), the Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS, or \"volunteer\" Army, to be disbanded after the war), and the various Southern state militias. The Confederate Constitution called for the President, Jefferson Davis to be Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy. It did not call for a commanding general of the army but several generals were advisors to President Davis.\nStructure.\nArmies.\nThe Confederate States Army included the following armies:\nConfederate officers.\nBefore the Civil War, many Confederate officers were in the United States Army. When war started, 313 army officers resigned and became officers in the Confederate army. Robert E. Lee was one of those who found it difficult to leave. Abraham Lincoln had offered to make him commander-in-chief of the Union Army. But he could not fight against his native Virginia. He became commander of the Virginia militia and when Virginia Seceded, a General of the Confederacy. \nMany militias elected their officers including field officers. When these units joined the Confederate army, their officers were commissioned. There were also a number of professional officers who came from Germany or Britain (just as there were in the Union army). But at the start of the war, few Southern officers had any real experience. Wealthy planters who owned 20 or more slaves were not required to serve in the army and many stayed home during the war. Some served in the Enlisted rank but many thought it was unfair to serve under officers so poor they could not afford a single slave. Many Confederate officers kept a slave as a personal servant throughout the war.\nConfederate soldiers.\nConfederate officers often did not maintain discipline among their men. Many of their soldiers were illiterate and some did not know which was their left foot and which was their right. At the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, even Lee complained about the lack of discipline in his army. Visiting foreign officials were shocked at lack of discipline and were amazed they could fight.\nAlmost all Confederate soldiers where white\nThe average Confederate soldier was in his early 20s. He was usually gaunt, unkempt and beards were common. It often did not fit, especially if taken off a dead soldier. Most wore a white shirt under their wool jacket. Replacement uniforms were hard to get. They would often stain homespun (clothing made at home) with a dye made from walnuts. This gave their uniforms a yellowish-brown appearance they called \"butternut\". Many did not have shoes or shoes that fit. Those who did nailed horseshoes to the bottom to keep them from wearing through the sole. At first he carried a musket or flintlock rifle. Later in the war many carried the better Enfield rifles taken from dead Union soldiers. Any boots, uniforms or supplies Union soldiers left behind or were captured were used by the Confederate soldiers. In camp, most of the tents were marked \"U.S.\" Most of the Southern Artillery was also captured Union cannons."}

{"id": "102748", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102748", "title": "Chauvet Cave", "text": "The Chauvet Cave or Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave is near Vallon-Pont-d'Arc, in the Ard\u00e8che d\u00e9partement, in southern France. It became famous in 1994 when Paleolithic artwork was found on the walls. There were remains of many animals, some which are now extinct. Also some footprints of animals and humans were found. The cave is one of the most significant prehistoric art sites, like Lascaux, Altamira, and Cosquer.\nFeatures.\nThe gorges of the Ard\u00e8che region have many caves. Many have geological or archaeological importance. The Chauvet Cave is unusually large. Its artwork is well preserved and of good quality. It was occupied by humans at two different times: the \"Aurignacian\" and the \"Gravettian\". Most of the artwork dates to the earlier Aurignacian era (30,000 to 32,000 years ago).\nThe only traces left of the later occupation during the Gravettian include a child's footprints, the charred remains of ancient hearths and carbon smoke stains from torches that lit the caves. It seems nobody had been in it after the child, until it was discovered in 1994. The footprints are some of the oldest human footprints in existence: they are between 20,000 and 30,000 years old.\nThe floor of the cave is of a soft material, almost like clay. There are paw prints of cave bears. There are also large rounded depressions in the floor. These are believed to be the \"nests\" where the bears slept. There are many fossilized bones, including the skulls of cave bears and the horned skull of an ibex.\nThere are hundreds of animal paintings there. At least 13 different species, including those which have rarely or never been found in other ice age paintings are represented. In addition to commonly hunted animals: horses, cattle, reindeer, etc.. The walls of the Chauvet Cave are covered with predatory animals: lions, panthers, bears, owls, rhinos and hyenas. Typical of most cave art, there are no paintings of complete human figures, although there is one possible, partial \"Venus\" figure that may represent the legs and genitals of a woman. A peculiar figure appears to have the lower body of a woman with the upper body of a bison. There are a few panels of red ochre hand prints and hand stencils made by spitting pigment over hands pressed against the cave surface. Abstract markings\u2014lines and dots\u2014are throughout the cave. There are also two unidentifiable images that have a vaguely butterfly shape to them. This combination of subjects has led experts in pre-historic art and cultures to believe that there was likely a ritualistic, shamanistic, or magical aspect to these paintings.\nThe artists who produced these unique paintings used techniques not often observed in other cave art. Many of the paintings appear to have been made only after the walls were scraped clear of debris and concretions. This left a smoother and noticeably lighter area upon which the artists worked. Similarly, a three dimensional quality is achieved by incising or etching about the outlines of certain figures. This visually emphasizes some of the animals and allows torch light to cast shadows about the edges.\nDating.\nThe cave contains the oldest known cave paintings, based on radiocarbon dating of \"black from drawings, from torch marks and from the floors.\" Clottes concludes that the \"dates fall into two groups, one around 27,000-26,000 BP and the other around 32,000-30,000 BP.\" As of 1999, the dates of 31 samples from the cave had been reported, with the earliest being 32,900\u00b1490 BP.\nHowever, some archaeologists have questioned these dates.\nHistory.\nThe cave was named after Jean-Marie Chauvet, who discovered it on 18 December 1994, together with Christian Hillaire and Eliette Brunel-Deschamps. The researchers found that the cave had been untouched for 20,000-30,000 years."}

These societies existed through much of Western Europe, until the Roman government took over and, later, Christianity arrived. Druids were part of the cultures of the tribal peoples who were called \"Keltoi\" (\"\u039a\u03ad\u03bb\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\") or \"Keltai\" (\"\u039a\u03ad\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\") and \"Galatai\" (\"\u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\") by the Greeks and \"Celtae\" and \"Galli\" by the Romans. In the communities they served, druids combined the duties of priest, arbitrator, healer, scholar, and magistrate. Both men and women served as druids, although there is no early proof for female druids, or druidesses.\nHistory.\nFrom what little we know of late druidic practices, it appears deeply traditional and conservative, in the sense that druids were conserving the old culture and lore for their communities. It is impossible now to judge whether this continuity had deep historical roots and originated in the social transformations of the late La T\u00e8ne culture, or whether there had been a discontinuity and then a religious innovation.\nGreek and Roman writers on the Celts commonly made at least passing reference to druids, though before Julius Caesar's report merely as \"barbarian philosophers\"; They were not concerned with ethnology or comparative religion and consequently our historical knowledge of druids is very limited. Druidic lore consisted of a large number of verses learned by heart, and Caesar remarked that twenty years were required to complete the course of study.\nDruidic culture are believed to be practicers of rituals and such magic, Druids were believed to be a neutral people they were known as Druid(ae) similar to priests and scholars believed to have studied rituals of Human sacrifice and Familiars (Known currently as a form of a pet from a practicer; Witch, Druidae, Warlock). The Druidic culture was believed to have some form of religious complication.\nDruids are known to have practiced such as reincarnation as animals of worship (Bird, Lion, Tiger, Cat, Monkey), but such cannot be proved as what we know so far.\nThey were said to have lived in Roman times in Great Britain and Ireland it is said that they have some form of connection to stonehenge and other monuments."}

It allows the holder to use Trains, Trams and Buses, in two zones (Zone 1 and Zone 2). Zone 1 covers areas close to the CBD, and Zone 2 covers the rest of the city. There used to be a Zone 3 , but that has been merged with Zone 2. The ticket is about the size of a credit card, and contains a magnitic strip that tells a computer what type of ticket it is.\nHistory.\nMetcard replaced a identical yet simpler system of scratchies used on the Melbourne public transport network. Scratchies were easy to cheat and the system was eventually abandoned in 2002, but not before tickets for many years of use were printed.\nMoves towards automated ticketing were first made by the then state Liberal Government in 1992. Tenders were called for the design, supply, installation and on-going maintenance of such a system, with the 'OneLink Transit Consortium' announced as the preferred people to do it in September 1993. The contract was signed in May 1994, with the major technology supplier being the ERG Group.\nTesting of prototypes commenced in December 1993, and the roll-out of the system was carried out from August 1996 to April 1998, and acceptance occurred in November 1997. Public field trials were carried out on buses from August 20 1996, and on rail services from September 18 1996. The system commenced full revenue service from May 1998 at a cost of $330 million. Contractual issues between OneLink and the Victorian Government were not settled until May 2002 with the payment of up to $65 million in a staged settlement.\nControversy surrounded Metcard at its introduction, due to it costing to much, the abolition of tram conductors and the unreliability of ticket purchasing and validation machines. The machines were attacked by vandals frequently (often by pouring liquids into the coin slot), and have seen several revisions to their design since.\nConsistent with the privatisation ethos of the government of the day, Metcard's operation was entirely outsourced, with the transport operators (at that time government-owned) having nothing to do with the system. Metcard even had its own website and branding which became stronger than the anonymous and constantly renaming government then privatised operators.\nAn study released by the State Government in 2001 showed over 1 in 4 (27.2%) of the machines at train stations did not work, and 11.9% of mobile equipment in buses and trams was non-operational. The State Government renegotiated with ticketing network contract operator \"OneLink Transit Systems\" to improve the service to commuters. Following these improvements, a 2002 audit showed an increase in availability of machines to 92.1% at train stations, and 98.3% on buses and trams. Usability was also improved, with tram machines able to sell daily tickets. Furthermore, vandalism across the network dropped by 62% between 2001 and 2002.\nV/Line tickets were aligned with the Metcard system in April 2006, with each V/Line ticket to stations in the Metcard area having the relevant zones printed on them. In March 2007 the Nightrider bus service was also brought under the Metcard system. Zone 3 was removed from the Metcard system (and merged into zone 2) on March 4 2007, due to a State Election promise made by Opposition Leader Ted Ballieu and matched by then Premier Steve Bracks.\nThe original Metcard contract with OneLink was to last nine years, expiring in March 2007. In 2005 the contract was changed to permit the system to be extended and changed as work on the replacement myki project keeps going, with the contract being able to be cancelled on six months notice.\nTypes of Metcards.\nMost Metcards can be purchased in Zone 1; Zone 2 and Zone 1 + Zone 2 types, with them being valid within their respective zones. All Metcards, except for the City Saver Metcard, are valid for muplitle trips on Trains, Trams and Buses."}

They are not directly linked to reproduction. \nMale birds usually have much more colourful feathers (plumage), the females are usually better able to hide, because their plumage is camouflaged.\nWell-known secondary sex characteristics in humans are the deeper voice, facial hair (mustache and beard) and more muscular build in men. In women, those characteristics usually cited are more prominent breasts, lips, eyes, long/fast growing hair, no facial hair, wider hips, more fat, and generally a higher voice. Faces, generally, make a big impact. It is the part other people interact with.\nHowever, the wider hips are needed to give birth. Babies are born through the space between the three bones of a woman's pelvis. So is doubtful to call this a \"secondary\" characteristic, except so far as the width helps attract mates. Breasts are also essential, but in humans they are much larger in proportion to other mammals, and they do serve to attract males. \nEvolutionary ideas.\nCharles Darwin thought that sexual selection, or competition within a species for mates explains many of the differences between sexes. Behaviour, such as male-to-male combat and female choice of males is a kind of secondary sex characteristic. Many 'ornaments' such brighter plumage, colouration, and other features have no immediate function except to improve the male's chances of being selected by females for breeding. Weapons such as antlers may serve both as defence against predators, and as status symbols advertising health and fitness."}

It begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia and possibly Oceania during the height of an Ice age. These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the \"Old World\" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th and 15th centuries.\nThe ancestors of today's Native Americans were hunter-gatherers who migrated into North America. The most popular theory says that migrants came to the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge, Beringia, the land mass covered by the cold ocean waters in the Bering Strait. Small Paleo-Indian groups probably followed the mammoth and other prey animals. It is possible that groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.\nCultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as Iroquois on North America and Quechuas of South America. These cultures later developed into civilizations. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered advanced or civilized include: Zapotec, Toltecs, Olmec, Maya, Aztecs, and the Inca.\nNorth America.\nPueblo people.\nThe Puebloan peoples of what is now the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, living conditions were that of large stone apartment like adobe structures. They live in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and possibly surrounding areas.\nChichimeca.\nChichimeca was the name that the Mexica (Aztecs) applied to a wide range of semi-nomadic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day Mexico, and had the same sense as the European term \"barbarian\". The name was adopted with a negative tone by the Spaniards when they spoke of the semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples of northern Mexico.\nZapotec.\nThe Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city Monte Alban.\nOlmec.\nThe Olmec civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in Mesoamerica and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.\nMaya.\nMaya history spans 3,000 years. The Maya may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.\nToltec.\nThe Toltec were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.\nTeotihuacan.\nTeotihuacan (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.\nAztec.\nThe Aztec having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.\nSouth America.\nNorte Chico.\nThe oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the Norte Chico region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The Quipu, a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico.\nChav\u00edn.\nThe Chav\u00edn established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chav\u00edn in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chav\u00edn civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.\nInca.\nHolding their capital at the great city of Cusco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.\nKnown as \"\", or \"the land of the four regions,\" in Quechua, the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precisely matched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful brain surgery in Inca civilization.\nPresent situation.\nThe number of Native Americans is increasing now in the U.S. by actual population growth, changing enrollment laws, and from the immigration from Spanish America, especially from Mexico, though the definition being applied to them is Hispanic.\nEffects of slavery.\nSlavery has had a significant role in the economic development the New World after the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans. Slaves helped build the roads upon which they were transported. The cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane harvested by slaves became important exports for the United States and the Caribbean countries. "}

In many ways the Sassanid period saw the highest achievement of Persian civilization, and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the Muslim conquest and adoption of Islam.\nPersia influenced Roman civilization considerably during the Sassanids' times,p109 and the Romans reserved for the Sassanid Persians alone the status of equals. The Roman Emperor wrote letters to the Persian Shahanshah, which were addressed to \"my brother\". Their cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe, Africa, China and India, and played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art.\nThis influence carried forward to the early Islamic world. The dynasty's unique, aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest of Iran into a Persian renaissance. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing and other skills were borrowed mainly from the Sassanid Persians and propagated throughout the broader Muslim world.\nDecline.\nIn the spring of 632, a grandson of Khosrau I, Yazdegerd III who had lived in hiding, ascended the throne. In that same year, the first raiders from the Arab tribes made their raids into Persian territory. They were united by Islam. Years of warfare had exhausted both the Byzantines and the Persians. The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation, religious unrest, rigid social stratification, the increasing power of the provincial landholders, and a rapid turnover of rulers. These factors made the Islamic conquest of Persia easier than it would have been in earlier times.\nThe Sassanids never mounted a truly effective resistance to the pressure applied by the Muslim conquests.\nSassanid Empire chronology.\n226\u2013241: Reign of Ardashir I:\n241\u2013271: Reign of Shapur I:\n271\u2013301: A period of dynastic struggles.\n283: War with Rome.

The diesel engine may drive the locomotive's wheels directly via a gearbox, shaft or chain (called mechanical transmission); by generating electricity which is in turn used to power the wheels (called diesel-electric); or by using a hydraulic transmission system (diesel-hydraulic). Diesel locomotives are extremely popular worldwide, due to their ease of use and reliability. They can be more powerful than steam locomotives and do not need an expensive power grid like electric locomotives.\nSteam locomotive.\nA steam locomotive uses wood, coal or oil (but mostly coal) as fuel to heat water in a boiler, which turns into steam which pushes pistons to power the train. Steam locomotives were invented in the early 19th century. They are not widely used any more due to their operational costs, especially the fuel costs; steam locomotives are now mostly only used on tourist railroads.\nElectric locomotive.\nAn electric locomotive runs on electricity as the name suggests. Electric locomotives cost the least to buy and operate. However, the railway electrification system is very expensive, so only tracks used by many trains per day are usually electrified.

Today, the name is trademarked.\nThe meditation technique is practiced while sitting down with the eyes closed and is practiced twice a day.\nReviews of studies on the effects of the Transcendental Meditation technique show some results are not definite while some reviews of studies show patterns of positive effects.\nProcedure.\nThe Transcendental Meditation technique is learned in seven steps. There are two lectures and a personal interview. This is followed by a session in which the student learns how to meditate. In three more sessions the meditation is checked to make sure the technique is being done correctly.\nGoal.\nThe goal of the Transcendental Meditation technique is said to be that the meditator continue to feel the deep rest, and the comfort of the meditation while living everyday life.\nOrigin.\nIn 1955, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (born Mahesh Prasad Varma) began teaching a meditation technique he says was based on the Vedas. He gave this method for meditation the name, Transcendental Meditation.\nBefore this, Maharishi had studied with his teacher Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, and was also his secretary from 1941 until Brahmananda Saraswati's death in 1953. In 1957, Maharishi began the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in Madras, India, on the last day of a festival held in memory of his teacher. In 1958, he began the first of a number of worldwide tours in which he began to teach the TM technique to people around the world.\nIn the early 1970s, Maharishi began to establish one Transcendental Meditation teaching center for each million of the people in the world, which at that time would have meant 3,600 Transcendental Meditation centers throughout the world. In 1990, Maharishi moved to the town of Vlodrop, in the Netherlands, where he began an organization he called The Global Country of World Peace that takes care of all of the teaching of the Transcendental Meditation technique around the world. The Global Country of World Peace says there are more than 6 million people worldwide who have learned the Transcendental Meditation technique.\nEffects on the Body.\nTranscendental Meditation has been researched since 1970. The earliest study, done in 1970, showed that with the Transcendental Meditation technique the body rests deeply, but is not asleep, and is alert. This study also showed that with the Transcendental Meditation technique stress became less.\nAccording to one study Transcendental Meditation has been found to not have any advantages over health education in improving a persons health.\nThe Transcendental Meditation technique, religion, and cults.\nTranscendental Meditation websites say the Transcendental Meditation technique does not interfere with a person's religion.\nIn 2013, Monsignor Raffaello Martinelli, servicing Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, having worked for over 23 years with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), said that for his Meditation, a Christian can learn from other religious traditions (zen, yoga, controlled respiration, Mantra):\" \"As long as the Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions, we should not despise these indications since non-Christian. Instead, we can collect from them what is useful, provided you never lose sight of the Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements, since it is within this that all these fragments must be reformulated and assumed.../...\u00bb\". In 1984, Cardinal Sin, an Archbishop in the Catholic Church stated that the Transcendental Meditation technique interferes with Christian religions. And other clergy believe the technique does not interfere with religious belief and practices.\nExperts on cults say those who use the Transcendental Meditation technique may show cult-like actions, while David Orme-Johnson, a psychologist and researcher who was once a professor at Maharishi University of Management, says studies show that those who use the Transcendental Meditation technique act in ways that are adult and self \u2013 sufficient, and do not act in the way people in cults are said to act."}

Despite this he was a relatively successful physician. The first description of Typhoid fever is attributed to him. \nToday he is mainly known as a mathematician. He made some discoveries in algebra. He proposed ways to solve cubic and quartic equations. Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia told him about the solution of one particular cubic equation, \"formula_1\". This caused a long fight. His student Lodovico Ferrari solved the quartic equations. Cardano also speaks about imaginary numbers in the same book, \"Ars Magna\".\nCardano was often short of money, and gambled compulsively. A book of his, \"Liber de ludo aleae\" (\"Book on Games of Chance\" in the English), contains the first systematic treatment of probability, as well as a section on cheating. He wrote it \"c.\" 1564, but it was first published posthumously, in 1663.\nHe invented various things, including the and the . He also believed that perpetual motion was impossible, except for stars."}

It means care of people who travel from one country to another, and knowledge of diseases foreign to the traveler. It also means people from one country trying to improve health in another.\nGroups.\nThere are different kinds of groups that are involved in international health. They engage in international health for different reasons and with different ethics and rules.\nGovernments of rich, \"developed\" countries are often interested in the health of other countries. They are especially interested in the health of neighbor countries. The reasons for this are many: if they have extra resources, they may want to share them with their neighbors; but also they may want to stop spread of diseases from their neighbor country across the border. For example, the United States is a richer country than Mexico and has little problem with measles (in children) or rabies (in mammals) in the interior, but along the border with Mexico these diseases are more common.\nThe Western Hemisphere's countries have formed PAHO, the Pan American Health Organization, to deal with these kinds of problems in an organized way. PAHO knows that people and goods flow across borders in both directions, and a problem in one country will soon be a problem in its partner countries. PAHO is an example of an international organization.\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) are associations organized outside of the government by volunteers and others, and which serve a particular interest. Often, NGOs interested in health perform important functions in international health, both in direct care and in development."}

Heihachi\u2019s goal was to make a new life form by splicing Ogre\u2019s genome with his own. However, the research was unsuccessful.\nAfter long experimentation, Heihachi\u2019s bioengineers came to the conclusion that an extra gene - the \"Devil Gene\" - was needed in order to successfully splice Ogre\u2019s genetic code into another living organism. Heihachi learned that his own genome did not have the Devil Gene, but he knew someone who had it, Jin Kazama.\nJin, who defeated Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, was shot and wounded by Heihachi. As his life slipped away, Jin transformed into a Devil. Upon his transformation, he struck down Heihachi and took flight. Jin\u2019s whereabouts were unknown after the Tournament.\nHeihachi searched for Jin to no avail. However, Heihachi found a photograph during his search that made him curious. The 20-year-old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with laceration wounds. Heihachi paid much attention to the corpse\u2019s back, which had what looked like deformed, protruding wing-like limbs.\nThinking that the picture was of Kazuya, his own son whom he threw into a volcano 20 years ago, Heihachi diverted all his resources into a search for the body. This search led Heihachi to G Corporation, a modern biotech firm making unprecedented advances in the field of biogenetics research.\nHeihachi found out that the G Corporation found the corpse and got its genetic data. In fact, Heihachi learned that the company was in the middle of creating a new life form by using the data. Heihachi also determined that Kazuya\u2019s remains and research data were secured at G Corporation\u2019s Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories, respectively.\nFriday, 25 December. The Tekken Force raided G Corporation\u2019s maximum security research laboratory in Nepal. The bottom floors of the building were destroyed, and the remaining data storage facility containing file servers was taken away by a group of heavy-duty helicopters.\nAt the same time, a separate unit led by Heihachi infiltrated the underground research facility in Nebraska, where Kazuya\u2019s remains were preserved. As Heihachi looked from his helicopter, he soon realized that unlike the Nepal facility, the operations in Nebraska were not going according to plan. The tactical status monitor screens showed the first wave of the Tekken Force troops being blown out from the storage room where Kazuya\u2019s remains were supposedly kept.\nA silhouette of a large figure slowly emerged from the room... When Heihachi could see clearly enough, he instantly recognized the large figure as Kazuya.\nKazuya was brought back to life in G Corporation\u2019s research facility. After his resurrection, Kazuya offered his body as research material to determine the true nature of the Devil that resided within him. Kazuya\u2019s goal was to combine his two selves into one. Kazuya theorized that if he unified his body with the Devil, he would be able to truly get its powers. He could then finally take revenge against Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu (Financial Empire).\nEnraged that Heihachi thwarted his plans, Kazuya obliterated the heavily armed Tekken Force and vanished into the flames of the lab\u2019s wreckage. Heihachi was infuriated by Kazuya\u2019s escape and took out his anger on his hapless subordinates who reported the escape.\nDr. Abel, Heihachi\u2019s lead scientific advisor, urged the enraged Heihachi to quickly find a way to capture Kazuya. Once his anger subsided, Heihachi focused his mind and decided on a plan. An evil smile crept upon his lips.\nTwo years had passed since The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3. The Mishima Zaibatsu announced The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and placed the massive financial empire as the top prize. The champion who manages to defeat Heihachi at the end of the Tournament would inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu.\nWell aware that the tournament is just a trap designed to lure him out, Kazuya nevertheless enters - it is his chance to defeat Heihachi\nCharacters.\nIt marked the first game of the Tekken series to have character conversations (aside from Julia's Tekken 3 ending, in which she speaks to Michelle). Some may speak in other languages (in part of Hwoarang's ending, Jin Kazama speaks in English). It is also the first game having each characters to speak in the beginning for Story Mode. In the background, sketches are seen that follow the characters story. Some may appear in the epilogue of a characters ending."}

Jin quickly beats his father. The oldest Mishima, Heihachi, enters the Honmaru to find his son defeated and asleep. Heihachi and Jin begin to fight. During the fight, Jin begins to show the Devil he got from his father, Kazuya. Just as it appears that Jin will kill Heihachi, Jin suddenly gains control of his body and flies away.\nSuddenly, a bunch of \"Jack\" robots interrupt the battle. Both Kazuya and Heihachi are surprised at the attack, and begin fighting as a team against the Jack robots. During the battle however, Kazuya goes against his father, throws him into the Jack robots and runs away. Raven, watching on top of the cliff, speaks into a headphone and says: \"Heihachi Mishima...is dead.\"\nAfter hearing of Heihachi's death, people though that it would bring the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu. However, an unknown person had taken control, and a month later Mishima Zaibatsu announced the opening of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5.\nTekken: Dark Resurrection Story.\nFollowing the end of the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, Heihachi Mishima defeated Kazuya Mishima and led him to Honmaru Temple, planning to let both his son Kazuya and his grandson, Jin Kazama, battle and steal their \"Devil Genes\". Jin defeats both his father and his grandfather and flies away, leaving the latter two asleep. Shortly after, a group Jack-4 robots invade the Honmaru. The robots were made to take Heihachi's life. At the start, Kazuya and Heihachi fight the Jack-4's as a team, but eventually Kazuya throws Heihachi across the room as soon as he notices that Heihachi is getting tired. Then, Kazuya turns into Devil Kazuya and escapes, leaving Heihachi to deal with the Jack-4's by himself. They quickly explode, leaving Heihach. The explosion brings Heihachi's father Jinpachi Mishima back to life from his 50 year sleep beneath the Temple, and goes to and become head of the Mishima Zaibatsu. A few months later, the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 is announced. It turns out that Heihachi survived the explosion, and now promises to find out and \"break the neck of the one who started this ridiculous tournament!\"\nGameplay.\nTekken 5 kept many features from the older games, as well as new features, such as the new \"Crush System\" and the chance to dress up all chaaracters differently (except for Mokujin). It was also the first Tekken game to have a mini-game that hade a story of its own. It also had stages with no walls like the stages in all the older Tekken games (except for Tekken 4). The stages did not also have all the slopes and uneven ground, like they did in Tekken 4.\nTekken 5.1.\nTekken 5.1 was a small upgrade of the original Tekken 5 that was not released on consoles and instead, was only on arcades. It contained different balance changes to characters of the original game. It also fixed the damage done when using fground moves, instead of ground moves doing 100% damage, they now only did 70% damage. The character health bars for this game is a different colour to the health bars on the original Tekken 5.\nTekken: Dark Resurrection.\nTekken: Dark Resurrection (DR for short) is an upgraded version of Tekken 5. It added two new characters, Emily \"Lili\" Rochefort and Sergei Dragunov, and it also added a returning older character, Armor King. Eddy Gordo also got his own character box, rather than just sharing a character box with Christie Monteiro. Plus, the game had new moves for the characters, as well as some changes to some older moves, in order to balance out the characters more, new customization items to use to dres up the characters, new stages, and new before fight and win animations, as well as some camera angle changes to some older ones. The game also recolored the main outfits of most of the characters, and the game's final boss, Jinpachi Mishima, got a new design, giving him a flame-like appearance, with a horn coming out of his head.\nAbout Tekken: Dark Resurrection.\nTekken 5 was re-released on the PlayStation Portable as Tekken: Dark Resurrection (known as Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection in arcades and on PlayStation 3) with new stages, two new characters, one extra returning character, an online mode, new costumes and more. The character select screen is also different and there are new modes such as the \"Tekken Dojo\" mode, where the player has to enter a tournament, defeating ghosts (not actual ghosts you see at Halloween). Later on, after the release of Tekken: Dark Resurrection on the PSP, Namco decided to release the arcade version of Tekken: Dark Resurrection (called Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection) on the PlayStation Store. The PS3 version was a bit different from the PSP version. It was very much like the arcade version, but not exactly. The only things missing are Story mode, Ghost downloads, Tekken Dojo and a Customizing mode (although you can dress your characters up after you select them and before you fight with them). On the PS3 version, Jinpachi Mishima is also a playble character, unlike in Tekken 5 and Tekken: Dark Resurrection where he is non-playable, unless a cheat device such as GameShark or an Action Replay was used (CWCheat and custom firmware 3.40 for PSP)."}

Both games have been liked by fans. Katsuhiro Hirada, game director for Tekken 6 and previous Tekken games, said that the stages will be bigger and will have more movement and interactivity,[9] such as walls or floors that can be broken so you can fight in new fighting areas. The character customization feature has been changed and become better, and will be more involved with the gameplay.\nA new \"rage\" system has been added, which allows characters to do more damage per hit when their health is low. In re mode, a reddish energy aura appears around the character and their health bar starts to flicker red. The rage aura can be changed into different colors and effects to appear like fire, electricity, ice and others. Another new feature added is the \"bound\" feature. Every character has some moves that, when used on the enemy that is currently midair in a juggle combo, will cause the opponent to be smashed hard into the ground, bouncing them off the floor, stunned and letting the attacker to perform another combo or attack.\nThe console versions will have an extra mode called \"Scenario Campaign\" which is similar to the \"Tekken Force\" and \"Devil Within\" modes from previous games. This mode is playable only by one player offline, but in the future the mode will be playable co-operatively online with two players. In this mode players can pick up weapons such as poles and gatling guns. Players can move almost any way they wantt to between fights, but when fighting enemies, the gameplay switches to the traditional Tekken style.\nBoth the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game will include an online versus multiplayer mode over PlayStation Network and Xbox Live respectively.\nTekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion.\nTekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion was supposed to be released on consoles instead of Tekken 6. It was supposed to be an upgrade of Tekken 6, having new fighting arenas, characters and more. In the end, Namco decided to release the original Tekken 6 on consoles with the updates and more things that can only be played on the console version."}

The province's territory was part of the El Seibo province.\nLocation.\nHato Mayor is bordered to the northwest by the province of Saman\u00e1, to the east by the El Seibo province, to the west by the Monte Plata province and to the south by the San Pedro de Macor\u00eds province. The Saman\u00e1 Bay is to the north of the province.\nHistory.\nSome native groups lived close to the coast, in caves in Los Haitises region. There were other groups, mainly Ta\u00ednos, living inland but, in general, the population was low.\nWhen the Spanish people came to this region, they found that there were many savannas with good grasses for food for cattle (cows), horses and sheep. And they made nine \"hatos\". \"Hato\" is a word from southern Spain that means a large farm for raising cattle (a ranch); it is a common word in the Dominican Republic. One of those \"hatos\" was Hato Mayor del Rey, made in the name of King Charles I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) but given as a \"Mayorazgo\" (a family property) to Francisco D\u00e1vila as the manager and the property was called sometimes \"Hato Mayor de D\u00e1vila\".\nBecause there were many French people and from other countries trying to live in the Saman\u00e1 region, the colonial government founded the city of Sabana de la Mar in 1760 and brought people from the Canary Islands to live here.\nThe area of Hato Mayor was part of the El Seibo province until the new province began in 1984 with three municipalities: Hato Mayor del Rey, its capital, and Sabana de la Mar and El Valle.\nThe municipal districts of the province were created in:\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Hato Mayor province, and 63,012 () living in towns and cities.

Although Ibbenb\u00fcren is already much older and a document of the year 1348 already occupies the establishment of a church in the year 799, the year 1146 is officially considered as the year of the foundation of Ibbenb\u00fcren.\nIn the years 1219 and/or 1234 it appears as church village. In this transition of the High Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages the noble gentlemen of Ibbenb\u00fcren, that is the abbot of Herford and the counts of Tecklenburg, possessed basic rule in the place. To this time Ibbenb\u00fcren belonged to the Diocese of Osnabr\u00fcck. During this time the castle of Ibbenb\u00fcren was built by the noble gentlemen of Ibbenb\u00fcren starting from 1150. Last remainder of this castle are the remnants of the heath tower in the proximity of the Aasee.\nAfter the noble gentleman of Ibbenb\u00fcren died out, Ibbenb\u00fcren came under the exclusive rule of the counts of Tecklenburg. This rule lasted until the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th century, when Ibbenb\u00fcren finally fell into possession Charles' V. in 1548 by awkward and luckless tactics used by the counts of Tecklenburg. Karl donated it to his sister Mary of Habsburg, governor of the Netherlands. Ibbenb\u00fcren was assigned to the office Lingen. Into this period also the falls the beginning of coal mining.\nAfter Ibbenb\u00fcren repeatedly fell under control of the Netherlands and Spain in the Dutch Revolt, it was assigned to the House of Orange-Nassau after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. In this time falls the beginning of iron ore mining in and around Ibbenb\u00fcren, which ended in the first half of the 19th century. By succession it came under Prussian rule in 1702. On February 1, 1724 Ibbenb\u00fcren attained municipal rights, which stood among other things in connection with the introduction excise duty. In the year 1743 the first magistrate and mayor appointed.\nDuring the rule of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte at the beginning of the 19th century, Ibbenb\u00fcren belonged to the first French Empire, until it was freed by Prussian and Russian troops in 1815. It came back under Prussian rule on January 1, 1816, resulting to be assigned to the district of Tecklenburg. After the end of World War II the city Ibbenb\u00fcren and the municipality Ibbenb\u00fcren Land formed by December 31, 1974 the department federation Ibbenb\u00fcren, resulting in today's city of Ibbenb\u00fcren. With the simultaneous dissolution of the district of Tecklenburg and fusion with the old district of Burgsteinfurt, Ibbenb\u00fcren was assigned to the new district of Steinfurt.\nCoat of arms.\nCoat of arms has a golden anchor on blue reason.

The signals produced by the interacting electrons contain useful information such as the shape, atomic structure and conductivity.\nIntroduction.\nWhen an electron hits the surface, it may be reflected (\"backscattered\"), absorbed, or conducted away. Electrons that are absorbed can cause the atom that they hit to become unstable, forcing it to give off another electron (a secondary electron), or to give off light in order to stabilize. Different detectors, for the different types of reactions, may be fitted to an electron microscope, depending on what is being looked for.\nThe magnification that can be achieved in a scanning electron microscope depends on how narrow the beam of electrons that strikes the surface can be, and can reach 1 nanometer, about the size of 3 to 5 atoms. The control of the beam is achieved using magnetic fields, with other magnetic fields being used to shape the beam, and to move it across the sample. The range of magnification may range from 30x to as high as 500,000x.\nSample.\nThe electron beam is affected by air and water molecules, so the sample must be placed in a vacuum. The sample must also be conductive to allow the electrons not reflected or absorbed to be conducted away. This gives some limits on the type of sample that can be used. In the case of samples from plants or animals, it often means that they must first be coated in gold before they can be placed in the microscope. This is done in order to preserve the sample and keep it from changing or decaying throughout the scanning process.\nComponents.\nThe scanning electron microscope is made up of several components:\n1. The electron gun is located at the very top or bottom of an SEM and is used to fire a beam of electrons at the object that we are looking at under SEM.\n2. The lenses are used to focus electron beams so that we can get clear and detailed images of the examined object. They are not made of glass, but they are made of magnets that change the path of electrons created from the electron gun.\n3. The sample chamber is the area where the specimen of interest is examined under SEM. As the technique is very sensitive, the chamber must be very sturdy and have no vibrations happen. This is to allow for the specimen to be kept very still in order for the SEM to produce good images.\n4. The detector is the \"eyes\" of the microscope. It is able to produce the most detailed images of a specimen's surface. Many different detectors can be used depending upon the information wanted from the sample used.\n5. The vacuum chamber is used to keep the electron beam from constant interference from air. The air particles are bad for electron beams in that the electrons would be knocked out of the air and onto the specimen, which will produce bad distorted surfaces of the specimen."}

It is a Hound, and it has short legs and long, soft ears. Beagles are mostly developed for hunting and finding hare, rabbit, and other kinds of game. They can do this because they can smell well and have very quick instincts. They are also popular as pets because of their good size, sweet temper, and health. This kind of character also makes them be used very much for animal testing. \nBeagles can have coats of different colors. Some variations can be tri-colored, orange, red, or lemon, although they are widely known for sporting the tri-colored look (Black, brown, and white). They usually have brown eyes.\nAlthough beagle-type dogs have existed for over 2,000 years, the modern kind came from Great Britain around the 1830s.\nBeagles have been included in popular culture since the times when Queen Elizabeth began to rule, in literature and paintings, and more recently in movie, television and comic books. Snoopy of the comic strip \"Peanuts\" has been picked as \"the world's most famous beagle\". \nHistory.\nEarly beagles.\nDogs that look almost the same as the modern Beagle can be traced in Ancient Greece\nback to around the 5th century BC. In the \"Treatise on Hunting\" or \"Cynegeticus\", written by Xenophon, who said there was a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed by foot. Small hounds were mentioned in the Forest Laws. If these laws were true, it would be enough proof that beagle-type dogs lived in England before 1016, but it is likely that the laws were written in the Middle Ages for tradition. \nIn the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a white, slow hound. Once, English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to make them faster in running. They are extinct now, but once they had made the Southern Hound more popular, which helped the Southern Hound descend to the Beagle.\nFrom medieval times, \"beagle\" was used as a general description for small hounds, even though they are actually very different from the modern breed. Small breeds of beagle-type dogs were living even from the times of Edward II and Henry VII. Edward and Henry both had packs of Glove Beagles, who were named because of their small size. Also, Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood at the shoulder. It was named so because it could fit in a \"pocket\" or saddlebag, when they rode along on the hunt. Elizabeth I called the dogs her \"singing beagles\" and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. Ever since then, it is possible that the name was used to refer to the same kind of small hounds. In George Jesse's \"Researches into the History of the British Dog\" from 1866, Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the Beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the:"}

The nephews used to live with their uncle, Donald Duck. They were left with Scrooge when Donald went off to join the Navy.\nScrooge is the richest duck in the world. He has no want for anything. This does not stop him from finding ways to try to get more money. Other common plots deal with him protecting his wealth from villains. In general, there were several different plotlines that were used many time in many of the episodes. Some of these plotlines included:\nSelected episodes.\nBack Out in the Outback.\nSomebody is sabotaging Scrooge's ranch when McDuck and his nephews go by plane to Australia. Scrooge, the Manager and MacQuack go by airplane to explore but they are attacked by light swords. Meanwhile, Webby loses herself in the jungle and sleeps on the woods.\nThe next day, Webby and some animals find an opal mine and discover that the Manager is responsible. The manager wants to buy Scrooge's ranch and become a rich man. Fortunately, Webby and the animals show who is the Manager and Scrooge preserves his ranch. Scrooge asked Webby when, how she made up to captured the bandit, she said \"group work\".\nMaster of the Djinni.\nScrooge McDuck and Huey, Dewey and Louie go to the Sahara desert to find Aladdin's lamp. Flintheart Glomgold follows them. The ducks find the lamp's vault but Scrooge and Glomgold rub it at the same time. The djinni comes out and because he can't tell who rubbed the lamp first, he decides to have a race between Scrooge and Glomgold. By Scrooge's suggestion, the djinni decides live in Manor McDuck during the race. Once the djinni and the nephews go to the mansion, Scrooge fights Glomgold's tramps (like the villain trying to kill him with a rock avalanche). Scrooge decides to win the race to Glomgold leave his nephews without a dime.\nAt McDuck's mansion, the djinni starts to like the luxuries of Scrooge's house (because he can eat burgers, swim in the pool and watch TV). He likes it so much that he decides to send Scrooge and Glomgold to back in time so he can live free forever. Because the two billionaires do not know about the time voyage, they continue running when they find a palace. The Sultan, thinking that they are spies of Hemir, decides to give them to crocodiles. But Schewebazade, the Sultan's young wife, saves them and they escape from the palace. The guards follow them and Glomgold go for his count. Meanwhile, the nephews and Webby, who witnessed the evil act of the djinni, put the djinni back in the lamp and let him leave only when he agrees to bring Scrooge back from the past.\nAt this moment, Scrooge and Glomgold come back to the present-day. Unfortunately, Glomgold finds and explores and make over win the race. Obviously, Scrooge can make over come to Duckburg only to discover that Glomgold won the race. Glomgold's first wish is to send Scrooge to a desert island. Glomgold uses his second wish by mistake to go to the desert island with Scrooge (he said he wishes he could see the look on Scrooge's face face when he gets there). At the island, Glomgold wishes that the lamp was never found in the first place. This puts everything back in time to when the ducks open the vault entrance. The explosion made the lamp fall and despite the ducks can back to Duckburg alive, the lamp stays in the vault as never found.\nSweet Duck of Youth.\nOne night, Scrooge McDuck and Launchpad go back to Manor McDuck. When Scrooge enters the mansion, he discovers that it is his birthday (which is weird because the show depicts it as a summer night whereas Scrooge's real birthday is in the winter or very late fall) and his family prepared a surprise party. Scrooge is unhappy because he is old. When Mrs. Beakley mentions the fountain of youth, Scrooge runs to the library. There he finds a book that talks about \"Ponce de Loon\", a Spanish explorer who said he found the fountain of youth in Florida.\nThe next day, in Florida, the ducks are in a tropical forest when they meet an old man who is also trying to find the fountain of youth.

There is a small Muslim minority.\nThe American botanist Joseph Rock saw the fighting between the Hui Muslim warlord Ma Qi and the Tibetan Buddhist of Labrang monastery. Even more brutal fighting broke out when war between Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian clique happened against the Guominjun warlord Feng Yuxiang in 1925, autumn. The position of Gansu governor was taken by Feng Yuxiang. Only Muslim warlords were left after many of the non-Muslim warlords were expelled by Liu Yufen's Guominjun army of 15,000 soldiers as acting governor under Feng Yuxiang. A huge amount of taxes were squeezed for Feng by Liu Yufen after an earthquake and famine brought about by drought. The in Hezhou a revolt against Liu Yufen was led in Liangzhou by Hui Muslim warlord Ma Tingxing (son of Ma Anliang) in 1928, Spring.

Oceans are very big and they join smaller seas together. Oceans (or marine biomes) cover 72% of Earth. There are five main oceans together. They are:\n1. Pacific Ocean\n2. Atlantic Ocean\n3. Indian Ocean \n4. Southern Ocean \n5. Arctic Ocean\nThe largest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. The smallest ocean is the Arctic Ocean. Many types of animals live in oceans, such as carp, crabs, starfish, sharks, and whales.\nDifferent water movements separate the Southern Ocean from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Southern Ocean is also called the Antarctic Ocean, because it covers the area around Antarctica.\nThe deepest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. The deep ocean is characterised by cold temperatures, high pressure, and complete darkness. Some very unusual organisms live in this part of the ocean. They do not require energy from the sun to survive, because they use chemicals from deep inside the Earth.\nColor.\nAlthough many people believe that the oceans are blue because the water reflects the blue sky, this is actually not true. Water has a very slight blue color that can only be seen when there is a lot of water. However, the main cause of the blue or blue/green color of the oceans is that water absorbs the red part of the incoming light, and reflects the green and blue part of the light. We then see the reflected light as the color of water.\nPlants and animals.\nMany organisms live in oceans. Organisms that live in oceans can live in salt water. They are affected by sunlight, temperature, water pressure, and water movement. Different ocean organisms live near the surface, in shallow waters, and in deep waters. Small plant organisms that live near the surface and use sunlight to produce food are called phytoplankton. Almost all animals in the ocean depend directly or indirectly on these plants. In shallow water, you may find lobsters and crabs. In deeper water, marine animals of many different shapes and sizes swim through the ocean. These include many types of fish, such as tuna, swordfish and marine mammals like dolphins and whales. The skies above the open ocean are home to large sea birds, such as the albatross.\nHarvesting the ocean.\nNations like Russia and Japan have lots of huge ships that go to some of the world's best fishing areas for many months. These large ships have libraries, hospitals, schools, repair (fixing) shops and other things that are needed for fishermen and their families.\nMany people look at the sea as a source of food, minerals and energy.\nFishing.\nAccording to the \"FishBase.org\" website, there are 33,200 known species of fish, and many of them live in the oceans. Many of these fish are a fine source of protein, so many people eat them. Fishing industries are very important because they make jobs and give food to millions of people. Today, usually through ocean fishing, the ocean supplies about 2% of the calories needed by people. Tuna, anchovies, and herring are harvested close to the surface of the ocean. Pollock, flounder and cod are caught near the ocean floor. More than a million tons of herring are caught every year in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, and almost eight fish out of ten fish are eaten as food for humans. The other fish are used as fertilizer, glue, and pet and other animal food.\nOcean temperatures.\nThere are many different ocean temperatures in the open ocean, both vertically (from top to bottom) and . Icebergs are made over very cold waters at either pole, while waters at the equator are pretty warm. Water cools and warms more slowly than land does, so land influenced by the ocean has later and milder seasons than land that is farther away from the ocean.\nThe surface part of the ocean, also called the \"mixed layer\", is not much colder even when we go deeper down. Below this surface zone is a layer of sudden temperature difference, called a \"thermocline\". This is a middle layer hat is from the surface zone down to about 2,600 feet (800 m). Thermoclines may happen only at seasons or permanently, and may change depending on where and how deep it is. As evaporation happens, it begins cooling, and if the water evaporates very quickly, the water becomes saltier. The salty, cold water is denser, so it sinks. This is why warm and cold waters do not easily mix. Most animals and plants live in the warm upper layer. Below the thermocline, temperature in the deep zone is so cold it is just above freezing - between ."}

The story of the movie was written by Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas. Set in 1957, this fourth movie in the Indiana Jones movie series is based around an older and wiser Indiana Jones (played by Harrison Ford) against agents of the Soviet Union\u2013led by Spalko (Cate Blanchett)\u2013for the crystal skull. Indy is helped by his former lover Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen), Mutt (played by Shia LaBeouf) and friend Mac (played by Ray Winstone). John Hurt, Jim Broadbent, and Ian McDiarmid also play fellow academics.\nThe movie was in \"development hell\" since the 1989 release of \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", because Spielberg and Ford did not agree over Lucas's choice of the skull as the center plot device. Screenwriters Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, M. Night Shyamalan, Frank Darabont and Jeff Nathanson wrote early versions, before David Koepp's script was chosen by all three men. Shooting finally started on June 18, 2007, and took place in New Mexico, New Haven, Connecticut, Hawaii, Fresno, California, and at soundstages in Los Angeles. This movie uses more stunts than CGI (computer generated images) so that the movie looks like the rest in the series. The music was created once again by John Williams.\nPlot.\nAt the beginning of the movie, the U.S Army is doing weapons testing in Nevada in 1957. It is then revealed that the Soviets have taken control of some of the army and shoot some security people dead. A group of Soviet men and agent Irina Spalko then pull Indiana Jones out of the car and make him get an object that he found ten years ago. He finds the box and tries to escape, but his friend Mac turns on him. After escaping, he finds himself in a fake town. The U.S Army then explodes an atomic bomb. Jones gets into a refrigerator and barely survives.\nBecause Jones was Mac's friend for a long time, the U.S government thinks that Jones might be a Communist. At Marshall College the next day (where Jones teaches), the head dean informs him that he is on a \"leave of absence\" and that the dean resigned in order to protect Jones. Jones packs his bags and leaves New York. Before he can leave, though, a young man named Mutt Williams comes to him and shows him a letter. Williams says that Harold Oxley, one of Jones's old friends, has been kidnapped. Later, these people kidnapped Williams' mother Mary and will kill them both if the crystal skull cannot be found.\nJones reads the letter and the puzzle and says that Oxley was referring to Cuzco, Peru. Jones and Williams fly down there, where Jones learns that Oxley was put in a jail a couple of months ago. In the prison, Oxley scratched out some drawings. Jones and Williams head to a grave site where they believe Francisco de Orellana lies buried; legend tells that he found the crystal skull but was never found. They find the skull and come up only to find Mac and some Soviets pointing weapons at them.\nAll of them fly to a new camp in the jungle. Spalko tells Jones that she believes that the skull was made by aliens and that it holds great power. There, Jones finds that \"Mary Williams\" is actually Marion Ravenwood, his old lover. He also finds Oxley, who is out of his mind, rambling and unable to speak a full sentence. Jones finds out what Oxley is saying. As the Soviets and Jones figure out where to go, Williams starts a fire and tries to get them to escape. Jones and Ravenwood fall in quicksand and start sinking. As they sink, Ravenwood tells Jones that Williams' real name is Henry Jones III and that he is Jones's son. Williams uses a snake to get them out of the sandpit. They are recaptured.\nThe next day, the Soviets begin destroying the forest as they seek to reach the Temple of Aktor, the area Oxley pointed out. Jones gets his ropes loose and takes over one of the cars, starting a long jungle chase. In the end, they find the area, the location where the crystal skull should be returned. Mac rejoins the group as a good guy, but in reality he was still not good, and left little blinking red lights as a trail so the slower Soviets can find where Jones and his party were.\nIn a chamber tomb, Jones and his party find that 13 crystal skeletons, with one missing a skull. Spalko takes the skull away from Oxley and puts it back. The temple begins to crumble. Spalko wants to know everything in the world but she soon knows too much and explodes. Jones and his party start to escape. Jones stops to try to get Mac, but Mac says it is okay and lets himself be taken away. After Jones exits the temple, he sees the temple collapse and reveal itself to be a flying saucer. Back home, Jones becomes the associate dean of Marshall College. He and Ravenwood get married."}

With just a few simple American Sign Language signs, babies and toddlers \u2014 some as young as nine months old \u2014 can show people their needs before they can speak, which may make them have fewer tantrums.

Fourteen months after she was born, Rachel and her husband, Aaron, found out that Leah was deaf since she was born. After that, the couple started to teach Leah sign language, first with Signing Exact English (SEE), then with American Sign Language (ASL),so that they could learn to communicate, becoming good signers. Rachel was surprised to see that after six months, Leah's sign language vocabulary had more words the vocabulary of hearing children her same age. Rachel's sister Emilie Brown and her husband Derek were teaching Leah's baby cousin, Alex, how to sign, and he learned it quickly also.\nA few years later, Rachel had a second daughter. Lucy was born 8 weeks premature, with spina bifida (this means there is a hole in your back when you are born and your spinal cord is sticking out) and cerebral palsy (your brain has trouble controlling your muscles). Doctors worried that, because of her cerebral palsy, Lucy would never be able to speak or use sign language to communicate with her deaf sister, but after the first volume was made, Lucy started to sign, and later, to speak. Rachel then thought that signing could be beneficial to all children.\nRachel and Emilie decided to make a video for hearing children so that American Sign Language could be made accessible to all children, and made Two Little Hands Productions, their producing company, together.\nHow the show works.\nRachel hosts the show herself, with her daughter Leah and nephew Alex also starring to help teach signs. In My First Signs, Rachel was not going to be in the videos, but she was added to show the signs because Alex and Leah (who were 3 and 4 then) could not sign clearly enough all the time to teach viewers the signs. In the earlier episodes, Rachel did not want to sing and sign at the same time since it causes some problems for those who want true American Sign Language, but customers responded, wanting more songs and wanting to learn signs from them. So, already being a musician, Rachel wrote more songs. Rachel sings a lot of songs during each episode, signing the words at the same time. During the episode, Rachel shows many signs from a certain topic (schools, daytime activities, etc.) and then has Leah and Alex sign\u2014they sign first now\u2014alongside with many other children of different backgrounds. After that, the words are emphasized with song.\nThe second season has a new layout that includes new signs and more original music. Each program teaches signs from one theme, marked by a theme song, which is taught verse by verse. This lets children develop a comforting knowing of the melody line of each song, helping to give them a sense of mastery and a feeling like they are actually \u201cwith\u201d the characters as they sing and sign along. Also, new parts \u201cABC Time,\u201d \u201cCounting Time,\u201d \u201cGame Time,\u201d \u201cStory Time,\u201d and \u201cHopping/Moving Time\u201d look into the episode theme or other skills in a playful way. These segments use teaching methods such as mnemonics (a way to make your memory better), songs, stories, and games, which are good for many different learning styles and abilities by promoting interaction through signing, singing, speaking and dancing.\nActors/Characters.\nRachel de Azevedo Coleman (\u201cRachel\u201d).\nRachel is the host of the Signing Time! series. She has spent much of her adult life working in entertainment. While performing with her band We the Living, Rachel foun out that her 14-month old daughter, Leah, was deaf. Rachel\u2019s second daughter, Lucy, had fetal surgery (surgery before she was born) for spina bifida and was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. In spite of such limitations, Lucy now communicates with both speech and sign language. After years of musical silence, Rachel has picked up that guitar again, writing and performing all of the songs for Signing Time!. She used to sing for her band. Now, she sings for Lucy, Leah, and children everywhere. In addition to starring in Signing Time!, Rachel is also a popular singer, performer, and speaker, and has performed for hundreds of thousands of children all across the country.\nLeah Coleman (\u201cLeah\u201d).\nLeah Coleman is the person that made her mother want to make Signing Time! Diagnosed as profoundly deaf at 14 months old, she began learning American Sign Language (ASL) as fast as her parents could learn it and teach it to her. Leah could sign full sentences long before her \u2018hearing\u2019 peers could even speak, and because of that, her parents say she never threw a tantrum. Leah is now in fifth grade and loves reading, skating on her \u201cHeelys\u201d and playing with her little sister Lucy. She recently won first place in her very first horse show and got national attention for winning first place in her school Spelling Bee, despite being deaf. Her favorite food is sushi and she loves the color purple. She loves being in \"Signing Time!\" with her cousin Alex, and teaching ASL to other children.\nAlex Brown (\u201cAlex\u201d).\nAlex Brown was in the very first episode of Signing Time! before his third birthday. He learned to sign as a baby so that he could communicate with his deaf cousin, Leah. He is now in fifth grade and loves to ride his bike, rollerblade, make comic books, draw mazes and play with his little brother Zachary. His favorite food is shrimp with shell pasta and his favorite color is green. He is a budding singer and pianist, but he enjoys \"playing\" the piano more than he enjoys practicing. A native of Salt Lake City, Utah, Alex has also lived in Virginia and California. He enjoys filming \"Signing Time!\" particularly when he gets to swing on the tire swing or have pillow fights on the set with Leah.\nHopkins.\nOriginally developed as a gecko named \u2018Twerp\u2019 (a play on the nickname \u2018Terp, for interpreter), \u201cHopkins\u201d the frog was supposed to be Leah\u2019s \u2018voice\u2019 and appear as a gift from Grandma and Grandpa. Alas, since Leah\u2019s speech is developing on her own, Hopkins is now very happy being a little green animated sidekick who loves to swim, paint, lift large pieces of fruit and eat unsuspecting flies. He is proudly named after Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, who in 1817 established the first free American school for the deaf and hearing-impaired.\nList of Episodes.\nAll numbers are Signing Time! volume numbers from the official website.\nSigning Time! Products.\nTwo Little Hands productions offers a wide variety of fun and educational American Sign Language (ASL) products.\nOther items include printed materials including board books and flash cards, \"Signing Time!\" clothing, and \"Signing Time!\" music CDs."}

He reformed The Pacemakers in 1972 with prominent Liverpool musicians Jose McLaughlin, Billy Kinsley and Pete Clarke. Gerry wrote a book about his life, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", which was published in 1993. Original band member, Freddie Marsden, died on December 9, 2006, at 66 years of age."}

{"id": "103981", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103981", "title": "Obsidian", "text": "Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass found as a kind of igneous rock. It is produced when lava high in silica (SiO2) cools rapidly, and solidifies without time for crystal growth. Because there is no crystal structure, obsidian blade edges can reach almost molecular thinness, leading to its ancient use as arrowheads, and its modern use as surgical scalpel blades.\nOrigin and properties.\nObsidian is mineral-like, but not crystalline. It is dark in color like basalt. It consists mainly of SiO2 (silicon dioxide), usually 70% or more.\nObsidian does not last forever. It is metastable: it changes very slowly. Over time, the glass becomes fine-grained crystals. So, no obsidian is older than Cretaceous age. It breaks down faster when water is present. Obsidian has little water, but takes it in if it sits in groundwater.\nUsually dark, the color varies on the presence of different materials. Iron and magnesium typically give the obsidian a dark green to brown to black color. A few samples are nearly colorless. In some stones, small crystals produce a snowflake pattern (\"snowflake obsidian\"). It may contain patterns of gas which produce effects such as a golden sheen (\"sheen obsidian\") or a rainbow sheen (\"rainbow obsidian\").\nHistorical use.\nObsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because, like flint, it could be chipped to produce hand axes, sharp blades or arrowheads.\nPre-Columbian Mesoamericans' used obsidian often. It was worked for tools and decorative objects. It was also polished to create early mirrors. Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Called a macuahuitl, the weapon could cause terrible injuries, because it combined the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated edge.\nNative American people traded obsidian throughout North America. Each volcano and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian. So archaeologists can trace the origins of a particular artifact. Obsidian can be identified in Greece as coming from different islands in the Aegean Sea. Obsidian cores (unworked lumps) and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast.\nModern archaeologists have developed a dating system to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts depending from the content of water in the object.\nOccurrence.\nObsidian can be found where high silicate eruptions have happened. There are solid obsidian flows in the calderas of Newberry Volcano and Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range of western North America, and at Inyo Craters east of the Sierra Nevada, California. Yellowstone National Park has a mountainside containing obsidian between Mammoth Hot Springs and the Norris Geyser Basin. Deposits can be found in many other western US states including Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Utah, Oregon and Idaho. Obsidian can also be found in Armenia, Turkey, Italy, Mexico, Iceland, Greece and Scotland.\nCurrent use.\nObsidian is used in heart surgery, as well-crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, with the edge of the blade being only about 3\u00a0nm wide. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope. When examined under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian produced narrower scars, fewer inflammatory cells, and less granulation tissue in a group of rats.\nObsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a gemstone. It possesses the property of presenting a different appearance according to the manner in which it is cut. When cut in one direction it is a beautiful jet black; when cut across another direction it is glistening gray."}

Just over 5,000 people live there.\nArran shares with the Hebrides cultural and physical similarities. Arran is mountainous and has been described as a \"geologist's paradise\".p11/17\nPeople have lived there since the early Neolithic period, from which time on there are numerous prehistoric remains.\nFrom the 6th century on peoples from Ireland colonised the island and it became a centre of religious activity. During the troubled Viking Age, Arran became the property of the Norwegian crown before becoming formally absorbed by the Kingdom of Scotland in the thirteenth century.\nThe 19th century \"clearances\" led to significant reductions in population and the end of the Gaelic language and way of life.\nThe economy and population have recovered in recent years, the main industry being tourism. There is diversity of wildlife, including three species of tree endemic to the area. There are regular field trips in the summer by geology and biology students.\nGeology.\nThe island is sometimes referred to as \"Scotland in miniature\", as it is divided into \"Highland\" and \"Lowland\" areas by the Highland Boundary Fault which runs northeast to southwest across Scotland.p297/301\nThe island is a popular destination for geologists, who come to see intrusive igneous landforms such as sills and dykes as well as sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Mesozoic.\nMost of the interior of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial volcanic activity around 60 million years ago in the Tertiary period. There is an older outer ring of coarse granites and an inner core of finer grained material.\nSedimentary rocks dominate the southern half of the island, especially Old and New Red Sandstone. Sand dunes are preserved in Permian sandstones near Brodick, there are localised outcrops of Triassic rocks,p143/4/9 and even some Cretaceous chalk.\nVisiting in 1787, the geologist James Hutton found his first example of an unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza. It showed evidence for his Plutonist theories of uniformitarianism, and about the age of the Earth. This spot is one of the most famous places in the study of geology.\nThe Pleistocene glaciations almost entirely covered Scotland in ice. After the last retreat of the ice at the close of the Pleistocene epoch sea levels were up to lower than at present and it is likely that circa 14,000 years ago the island was connected to mainland Scotland.p68/69\nSea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting coastlines a complex task, but the island is clearly ringed by post glacial raised beaches.p28\nWhat this means is that the huge weight of ice pressed down the Earth's crust here, and so the beaches were much higher up than now. Gradually, long after the ice melted, the island came back up.\nKing's Cave on the south west coast is an example of such a raised beach. This cave, which is over long and up to high, lies well above the present day sea level.\nThere are tall sea cliffs to the north east including large rock slides under the heights of Torr Reamhar and at Scriden (\"An Scriodan\") at the far north end of the island. The Scriden rocks fell \"some two hundred years ago, with a concussion that shook the earth and was heard in Bute and Argyllshire\".p19"}

There are Wild Asian Water Buffaloes and domestic buffaloes or domestic Asian water buffalo. They are bred in Asia, South America and in Southern Europe. They were bred from the Wild Asian Water Buffalo, which is now an endangered species.\nToday, these buffaloes are used for their milk, which has more fat than that of cows. The milk is processed to make Mozzarella, and curd. Feral populations are sometimes used to manage uncontrolled growth of vegetation around wetlands. They will simply graze it off. This keeps such bodies of water usable by birds and other wildlife.\nFemales normally give birth to calves every other year. Young bulls usually stay with herds of mothers, which have about 30 buffalo, for three years after birth. They then go on to form small all-male herds.\nWater buffalo have been kept by humans for more than 5,000 years. They have helped humans with their meat, horns, hides, milk, butterfat, and power, plowing and transporting people and crops.\nWild water buffalo are endangered. They live only in a small number of protected areas in countries like India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Thailand."}

China calls this the June Fourth Incident, but to most of the world it is the Tiananmen Square massacre.\nOverview.\nThe Tiananmen Square protests were student-led demonstrations calling for democracy, free speech and a free press in China. There were other protests on Tiananmen square in 1919 and 1976. The protests of 1989 were organised by groups of students, intellectuals and labour activists. There was no common cause or leadership in the protests. However, most protesters did not like the way the Communist party of China ran the economy. Some people also wanted a change towards more democracy. Most people protested on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, but some also did in other cities, like Shanghai. The protests in cities other than Beijing stayed peaceful.\nOn June 4, 1989, the government used force to end the protests. This left many people injured or dead. The exact number is not known today. The Chinese government speaks about 200 - 300 victims, the \"New York Times\" says there were between 300 and 800, and the Chinese Red Cross talks about 2,000 - 3,000.\nThe official Chinese position on the events was that the protests needed to be dispersed in order not to harm the stability of the country.\nMany of the scenes were shown around the world over western media (the most famous image is that showing a man standing in front of a file of tanks in the middle of the square).\nThe protests had various causes. The corruption of the Communist Party was a main issue. The control of the economy was working badly. The country was poor, and city dwellers got the worst of it.\nIronically, this all happened under the rule of Deng Xiaoping. He was Mao Zedong's successor in 1978 and launched the economic reforms. These reforms helped life for farmers and people who lived in the countryside, but was bad for city dwellers. Intellectuals, students, and industrial workers, feared unemployment rising and social problems. They felt disenfranchised. This means people felt they could do nothing about these problems.\nWhen reformer Hu Yaobang suddenly died of a heart attack on (15 April 1989), students reacted strongly. Hu's death provided the reason for students to gather in large numbers. In university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for a revival of Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.\nIt is said this was one of the largest specific-purposed, overcrowded demonstrations there has been in all of modern history.\nMemorials.\nAfter 1989, memorials have traditionally been held every year to honor the June 4, 1989 student-led pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. \nIn 2019, there were months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which is a partly independent Chinese territory. The 2019 protests led Beijing to approve a national security law in Hong Kong in 2020. Under the law, anyone believed to be involved in terrorism or the weakening of state power could be tried and face life in prison.\nIn 2020, China banned the annual ceremony for the first time in 30 years. Police said the ban was needed for public health reasons related to COVID-19, but critics say the ban is part of ongoing measures to stop political dissent. More than 12 activists first attended the June 4 ceremony despite the ban and thousands came later. The crowds broke through barriers set up around Victoria Park to light candles and sing songs. Police later arrested over 20 activists, including leaders of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, the group that organizes the yearly ceremony."}

The purpose of most \"evangelism\" is to help others receive eternal (forever) salvation to people who have not heard of, or have denied God. \"Evangelism\" is done in obedience to the Great Commission, a command from Jesus to his disciples to convert others, as recorded in the New Testament. \nChristians who are superior at \"evangelism\" are known as evangelists, whether in their areas or to far away places. Some Christian traditions consider \"evangelists\" to be in a leadership position, and they may be found preaching to large meetings. \nNotable evangelists.\nCharles Finney was an evangelist in the 19th century. He was a leader in the Second Great Awakening, a time when many in America came to the Christian faith. Dwight L. Moody preached in the last half of the 19th century and also started a Christian school, the Moody Bible Institute. Aimee Semple McPherson preached in the 1920s and 1930s. In the middle years of the 20th century Festo Kivengere, an Anglican Bishop preached in Africa with great results. A prominent evangelist in the 20th century was Billy Graham. His son Franklin Graham followed him, preaching in the 21st century. Reinhard Bonnke (1940-2019) was an evangelist, largely in Africa. He preached to as many as 100,000 persons at a time. Many missionaries are evangelists, although missionaries also have done other work to promote their faith.\nTypes of Evangelism.\nAlthough most Christian denominations perform some sort of evangelism, Evangelical and Pentecostal denominations are very focused on this issue."}

It is a major center for tourism, show business and commerce. The square is at the meeting point of Broadway, 7th Avenue and 42nd street. One of the biggest stations in the New York City Subway system is under Times Square. The well-known city street area is probably most famous for its New Year's Eve ball drop that happens every year. It is one of the most famous sights of New York.\nEarly history.\nWhen Dutch people first came to Manhattan, there were three small streams. They came together near what is now 10th Avenue and 40th Street. These three streams were part of a big stream called the \"Great Kill\" (Dutch: \"Grote Kill\"). From there the Great Kill went through the low-lying Reed Valley, known for fish and other water animals. Its end was a deep bay in the Hudson River at present-day 42nd Street. People lived in a small area named Great Kill, where carriages were made. The higher land to the south and east was called Longacre.\nWhen the American Revolution was happening, John Morin Scott owned the land. Scott was in the army, which was led by George Washington. During the early 1800s, John Jacob Astor bought the land, then built houses and hotels for the rich on the land. By 1872, carriages were mainly made in Longacre. The city government named the area Longacre Square after Long Acre, a place in London where carriages were also made. Soon after, Broadway theaters were created around Longacre Square.\nIn 1904, \"New York Times\" moved to a new building on 42nd Street at Longacre Square. Under there, a New York City Subway station was built. The area has been called \"Times Square\" since April 8, 1904. The square took its name from the newspaper. In 1913, the \"Times\" moved again. The old Times Building, One Times Square, is best known for the Times Square Ball drop that happens every December 31.\nSince 1913, the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States, has ended in Times Square. During the early 20th century, theatres, music halls, and very fancy hotels were built here. People called the area \"The Tenderloin\" because many people wanted to come to Times Square. Still, there were some gangsters in Times Square.\nBy the 1930s, Times Square was becoming a bad place to visit.\nLater history.\nBy the 1960s, \"The New York Times\" said that 42nd Street in Times Square was \"the 'worst' [block] in town\", By 1984, 2,300 crimes happened in Times Square; 460 were very bad crimes like murders. The NYPD did not help to get rid of the crime in Times Square. People moved out of Times Square, and it became empty.\nIn the 1980s through the mid-1990s, Rudolph Giuliani cleaned up the area. People did not want to go to Times Square in the 1970s. Giuliani got rid of prostitutes and drug dealers, and put in Disney stores and other places that tourists wanted to go.\nThere are many big signs on buildings in Times Square. There are as many big signs in Times Square than in Las Vegas.\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, more than seven thousand police officers came to Times Square. Before, there were only 3,500 officers.\nOn March 6, 2008, a bomb went off in Times Square. No one was hurt. On May 1, 2010, another bomb was found in Times Square, and everyone was asked to leave. The bomb did not go off.\nOn February 26, 2009, Mayor Michael Bloomberg closed Broadway to cars for a year. On February 11, 2010, Bloomberg said that Broadway in Times Square would be closed to cars forever.\nStarting in February 2011, New York City stopped people from smoking in Times Square.\nNumber of visitors.\nTimes Square is the most visited place in the world. 360,000 people come here in a day, and 131 million visit Times Square in a year.\nEven if people who live here are not counted, Times Square is the second most visited place in the world, behind the Las Vegas Strip. Because of the high number of visitors, Times Square gets $1 Dollar per year from stores, hotels, and attractions."}

This was in northern Sudan of today. We know about it through the Egyptians who moved south around 2500 BC. When the Middle Kingdom of Egypt ended an independent kingdom of Kush developed. About 1500 BC Egyptians moved southwards again, but this time met organized resistance. Historians are not sure whether this resistance came from many city states or a single unified empire. The Egyptians won, and the region became a colony of Egypt under the control of Thutmose I. The region supplied Egypt with resources.\nIn the eleventh century BC internal disputes in Egypt caused colonial rule to collapse and an independent kingdom arose based at Napata in Nubia. This kingdom was ruled by locals who overthrew the colonial regime. But Kush had many beliefs and gods in common with Egypt.\nIn the Bible.\nThe name given to this civilization comes from the Old Testament where Cush (Hebrew: \u05db\u05d5\u05e9) was one of the sons of Ham (Son of Noah) who settled in Northeast Africa. The Bible refers to Cush on a number of occasions. Moses wife, Tzipporah, is described as a Kushite in the book of Numbers."}

{"id": "104290", "revid": "7598618", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=104290", "title": "Control theory", "text": "Control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics. It deals with the behavior of systems. The desired output of a system is called the \"reference\". In that context, a system can be influenced by certain input values. Depending on the input values, the system may change its state or its behavior. Common questions control theory asks: \nOne of the first modern people to talk about control theory was James Clerk Maxwell. In his work On Governors, of 1868, he looked at the dynamic properties of centrifugal governors, as they were used by steam engines. Such governors were already used to regulate the speed of windmills.\nMathematical model.\nA system is a model used to describe the behaviour of something in the real world that takes inputs and produces outputs. For example, a car is a system in that the driver chooses how hard to press on the gas pedal (the input) and the car drives along the road at a certain speed (the output). In the case of a car, the input to the gas pedal does not fully determine the speed of the car. The weight in the car, the incline of the road, the traction of the tires, the current speed of the car, and other factors can all change the output received for a particular input. Control theory attempts to determine what inputs will result in a desired output, or reference. This is accomplished using differential equations, linear algebra, and other branches of math. Control theory relies heavily on computational models and software. \nControl system.\nIn a control system a controller manipulates the inputs to a system. In the control systems one or more output variables of a system need to follow a certain reference over time. By manipulating the input, the controller wants to obtain the desired effect on the output of the system. If we were to take a system without a controller it would simply have an input and an output. As there is no way to track the output relative to the input then the system is practically useless. If we add a controller, by feeding the output through the controller back to the input the output can be manipulated to meet the desired criteria. For example, if a kettle did not have a controller and it were switched on it would continue to boil the water indefinitely. By adding a controller, the boiling water (reference) is fed back to the input through the controller. The controller then tells the input to turn off the power as the water is already boiling. The system without the controller is called the open-loop system. When you add a controller in a feedback loop you create a closed-loop system. Open-loop systems are rarely ever considered stable as they cannot be controlled based on their output. Closed-loop systems incorporate a controller or series of controllers which, depending on the current output, configure the input such that the output will have the desired response."}

Blackletter in writing or print was used in Western Europe from about 1150 to the 17th century. It was used for printing in Germany until the 20th century.\nLetter shapes in printing were copied from letter shapes in a style of handwriting. So, the Gothic script of northern Europe and the Latin script used in Italy were both copied into print typography.\nThe name \"Gothic\" script.\nSome people call blackletter Old English. This is not right, because Old English is a language, not a script, and many centuries older. Also \"Gothic\" script has nothing to do with the Goths. They lived in central Europe from the 3rd to 6th century and wrote in runes. Blackletter must not be confused either with the ancient Gothic alphabet or with the sans-serif typefaces that are also sometimes called \"Gothic\".\nThe term \"Gothic\" was first used to describe this script in fifteenth century Italy, in the midst of the Renaissance. Scholars thought it was a barbaric script: \"Gothic\" was a synonym for \"barbaric\". \nNot only were blackletter forms called \"Gothic script\", but any other seemingly barbarian script was also labeled \"Gothic\". In contrast, the humanists preferred the Carolingian minuscule, a highly legible script. They called it \"littera antiqua\", \"the ancient letter\", believing that it was the script used by the Romans. But actually it was invented in the reign of Charlemagne.\nOrigins.\nCarolingian minuscule was the direct and linear ancestor of blackletter. Blackletter came from Carolingian when Europe in the twelfth century needed new books in many different subjects when more and more people learned to read. New universities were founded, each writing books for business, law, grammar, history, and other topics, not only religious books, where earlier scripts were used.\nThese books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand. Carolingian, though legible, was time-consuming and labour-intensive to produce. It was large and wide and took up a lot of space on a manuscript in a time when writing materials were very costly. As early as the eleventh century, different forms of Carolingian were already being used, and by the mid-twelfth century, a clearly distinguishable form, able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books, was being used in north-eastern France and the Low Countries."}

It was sold in Japan on January 21, 1999, in North America on April 26, 1999, and in Europe on November 19, 1999. \"Super Smash Bros.\" is the first game in the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series. The second game in the series is \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" for Nintendo GameCube and was sold in 2001. \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" is the third game in the series and was made for Wii. \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" are be the fourth games to be release for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. \"Super Smash Bros.\" was in the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 20, 2009, ten years after it was made for Nintendo 64. \"Super Smash Bros Ultimate\" was released for Nintendo Switch.\nIn the game, the players can control every characters from the video game series, including \"Mario\", \"Pok\u00e9mon\", \"The Legend of Zelda\" and many others. The games are very different compared to other fighting games. Other characters include Ike, Marth, Zelda/Sheik, Kirby, Ganondorf, Sonic the Hedgehog, Solid Snake, and Jigglypuff among others.\nCharacters.\nSecret Characters.\nSuper Smash Bros. has 12 characters. 8 starters and 4 unlockables. Pit, King Dedede, Mewtwo, Meowth, Bowser, and Princess Peach were going to be in \"Super Smash Bros.\", but were removed. They all made it in either \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" or \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". Meowth does appear in \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" but only as a Pok\u00e9ball Pok\u00e9mon. Master Hand is a character that you will always fight last.\nGameplay.\nThe point of the game is to beat the character(s) that you are fighting. To beat them you must hit them again until they are very hurt. Once they are very hurt, you have to knock them off of the stage in some way.\nOne player mode.\nIn 1P mode, you have to fight all of the characters in the game (including the one you are using) and Master Hand. You also play some mini-games along the way. In this mode, you can unlock characters and stages by doing certain things. It does not work like that with Master Hand, though. With Master Hand, you have to hit him again and again until he dies. You do not have to knock him off the stage. It's impossible to knock him off the stage.\nMultiplayer mode.\nIn multiplayer mode, up to 4 people can play against each other non-stop. If there are fighters that have died at the same time, they will fight in a sudden death battle. In that battle, they are badly hurt and they have to fight other fighters who made it into the sudden death battle as well.\nMini-games.\nThe two mini-games are \"Break The Targets\" and \"Board The Platforms\". In Break The Targets, you have to break 10 targets. It's very hard to get all 10 of the targets. The same goes for Board The Platforms except you have to just simply land on all of the platforms. Board The Platforms is a little bit harder than Break The Targets. Characters can be unlocked in these mini-games.\nDevelopment.\n\"Super Smash Bros.\" was made by HAL Laboratory in 1998. It was first called , and it did not have all those characters from different Nintendo games. Later, Sakurai had an idea of having characters from different Nintendo games to make it very fun. Lots of people liked it so he began making the game with some people. At first, it was only sold in Japan. Sakurai saw how many people bought the game and liked it so the game was sold in other countries as well.\nReception.\n\"Super Smash Bros.\" became very popular, and quickly became a Player's Choice game (which means it's very good). In Japan, 1.97\u00a0million \"Super Smash Bros.\" CDs were sold, and 2.93\u00a0million \"Super Smash Bros.\" CDs have been sold in the United States."}

This species probably fed on penguins, seals and vegetation.\nIt is unclear how they got to the Falkland Islands. The most common theory was that the warrah descended from domestic dogs brought to the Falkland Islands by the Yaghan of Tierra del Fuego. This explained the lack of their fear of humans. \nHowever, this theory was seen as implausible because the Falkland Islands are far from mainland South America and the sea between the mainland and the islands is very windy, making it impossible to cross in simple canoes.

The Postal Service is for the service of Americans, so it is generally left out of politics between political parties.\nLaws Affecting The Postal Service.\nU.S. Constitution.\nThe Constitution gives Congress the ability to \"establish post offices and post roads.\" Congress used this power to originally create the Post Office as well as give it power.\nU.S. Code Title 39.\nThis code outlines the duties and powers of the Postal Service, making its mission of service clear.\nPostal Reorganization Act.\nThis law, signed in 1970 by President Richard Nixon, separated the Postal Service from the rest of the Executive Branch, allowing them to act independently without approval from Congress.\nPostal Accountability and Enhancement Act.\nThis law, signed in 2006, requires the Postal Service to put money into their Retiree Health Benefit Program ahead of time. This would allow them to save money for the future. Since this law, however, the Postal Service has often been losing money due to high operating costs."}

The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spine. When a person gets Parkinson's disease, the cells that make dopamine in a part of the brain die. Dopamine cells send information to other cells which makes us do the actions we do. Because of this, Parkinson's disease mainly affects the body's motor system.\nParkinson's disease is a disease that gets worse over time. People normally get Parkinson's disease when they are over 50 years old. It is sometimes very hard for doctors to detect.\nCauses.\nDoctors are studying the exact causes of Parkinson's. It is said that Parkinson's develops through a combination of genetic errors and several possible influences, but not much is known. Doctors have discovered some clues about the cause(s). It is caused by the destruction of specialised ganglions in the brain. The production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, reduces. Parkinson's can also be genetic. But research shows that genetic Parkinson's is not normal, and is uncommon. Parkinson's disease is more frequent among those who work with pesticides or have had a history of head injuries.\nResearch suggests that people are slightly less likely to get Parkinson's disease if they smoke cigarettes.\nSymptoms.\nParkinson's disease can cause the brain to not respond. The patient may become paralyzed. The disease can give the patient slow reaction time and poor coordination between the hand and the brain.\nIt hurts the patient's movement skills and their speech. It can also affect mood, behavior and thinking. A common symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease is tremors. Tremors cause people's hands, legs, and arms to shake. Some symptoms include skin problems, depression, and difficulty swallowing.\nThe symptoms of Parkinson's disease include stiff muscles and trouble with movement. This disease gives patients slow reaction time. It makes it hard for them to do simple things like walking and talking. It also causes depression and other emotional changes.\nTreatments.\nParkinson's disease cannot be completely cured yet. Still, people have tried to cure it with drugs. One treatment is to put back the lost dopamine. A group of drugs called dopamine receptor agonists acts similarly to dopamine when put in the brain. There are four different drugs included in that group. Many patients take one of those with another drug. That other drug is called L-dopa. Unlike the dopamine, the L-dopa can enter the brain. The dopamine cannot enter the brain. This is why many patients take L-dopa and dopamine together. In the beginning, L-dopa helps a lot. But as the disease develops, the L-dopa doesn't work as well. Two other drugs used are anticholinergics and selegiline. They both help lessen symptoms. Anticholinergics help the patient stop shaking. Selegiline is meant to protect the nerves in the central nervous system. Selegiline is not often used. This is because there is no real proof that it helps.\nDeep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgery that is used some people who suffer from Parkinson's disease."}

These species became extinct during the Pleistocene (16,100\u00b1100 - 50,000 years before present), but exact dates for their extinction have only been discovered recently.\nSome mythological creatures from the Aboriginal dreamtime look a bit like animals from the prehistoric Australian megafauna.\nExtinction.\nScientists have been unable to agree on the reasons the megafauna became extinct. It is possible when humans came to Australia (around 48,000-60,000 years ago), and began hunting and using fire, they may have caused the extinction of the megafauna. Climate change, which made the country much drier during an Ice Age about 18,000 years ago, may have also have led to the extinction of the megafauna. Some scientists say that climate change alone caused the extinction of the megafauna. This argument does not allow for the fact that the megafaunal species had lived through two million years of climate changes. They had lived through a number of dry times before their sudden extinction.\nNew evidence.\nScientists have got new evidence, based on new and better ways of finding dates, using optically stimulated luminescence and Uranium-thorium dating of megafaunal bones. This suggests that humans were the main cause of the extinction of megafauna in Australia. The dates show that the last of the megafauna became extinct around the same time, about 47,000 years ago. This was the time in which humans first arrived in Australia. The dates suggest the main reason for extinction was human burning of the land. Many plants were not able to survive regular fires, and so the types of plants changed. Scientists have studied oxygen and carbon isotopes from teeth of megafauna. These show sudden, dramatic, non-climate-related changes in plants, and in the diet of surviving marsupial animals, as well as the loss of megafaunal species. Further study of the teeth of megafauna shows the climate was dry at the time of extinction, similar to the dry climate of today, and that the megafauna were able to live in dry climates.\nExtinct Australian megafauna: pre-1788.\nThe following is a list of some of the Australian megafauna.

Pickering said that he had found a tenth moon of the planet Saturn. Pickering named the moon Themis. No other astronomer has ever seen the moon that Pickering said he saw. Because of this, astronomers do not count Themis as an official moon of Saturn.\nPickering tried to figure out an orbit for Themis. He thought that Themis had an inclination of 39.1\u00b0 to the ecliptic, with 0.23 eccentricity (0.23) and a semi-major axis distance of 1,457,000\u00a0km. This meant that Themis had an orbit like the moons Titan and Hyperion. Pickering believed that it took Themis 20.85 days to orbit Saturn, in a prograde motion.\nPickering thought that the diameter of Themis was about 38 miles (61\u00a0km). Pickering had also discovered the moon Phoebe, but modern astronomers know that Pickering made a mistake when he gave 42 miles (68\u00a0km) as the diameter of Phoebe. Because astronomers know how Pickering made his mistake, they can say that if Themis existed, it would have a diameter of 200\u00a0km.\nIn April 1861, Hermann Goldschmidt also thought he discovered a new satellite of Saturn between Titan and Hyperion. Goldschmidt called this moon Chiron. The moon Chiron also does not exist, but the name was used much later for the comet/asteroid 2060 Chiron.\nIn 1906, the French Academy of Sciences gave Pickering the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his \"discovery of the ninth and tenth satellites of Saturn\".\nThe actual tenth satellite of Saturn (in order of discovery) was Janus, which was discovered in 1966 and confirmed in 1980. Its orbit is far from the supposed orbit of Themis.\nThere is also an asteroid named 24 Themis."}

During this period it grew to become one of the largest cities in the world.\nHistory.\nThe site of the city, on what is now known as Tokyo Bay, had been settled for several centuries, but first became historically significant with the building of Edo Castle in 1457 by order of \u014cta D\u014dkan. Kyoto was the site of the Japanese emperor's residence and the capital of Japan for many centuries, until the Tokugawa shogunate was established in 1603 and Edo became its seat of government. From that point Kyoto remained merely the formal capital of the country, while the \"de facto\" capital was now Edo, the center of real political power. Edo consequently rapidly grew from what had been a small, virtually unknown fishing village in 1457 to a big city of 1,000,000 residents by 1721, the largest city in the world at the time.\nIn 1868, when the shogunate came to an end, the city was renamed \"Tokyo\", meaning \"eastern capital\", and the emperor moved his residence to Tokyo, making the city the formal capital of Japan."}

It has developed through many environmental, political, and cultural changes. There are special rules for eating meals in Korea.\nKorean food is mostly made up of rice, noodles, vegetables, and meats. Most Korean meals have many side dishes (called \"banchan\") along with their steam-cooked rice. Kimchi is usually eaten at every meal. Sesame oil, \"doenjang\", soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, pepper and \"gochujang\" are ingredients that are often used in the food.\nIn different provinces of Korea, its ingredients and dishes are different, too. The Korean royal court cuisine used to serve all the best dishes from each province for the royal family. People follow special rules when they eat meals in Korea.\nSweets.\nTraditional rice cakes like \"tteok\" are eaten as treats during holidays and festivals. \"Tteok\" means all rice cakes made from pounded rice (\uba54\ub5a1, \"metteok\"), pounded glutinous rice (\ucc30\ub5a1, \"chaltteok\"), or glutinous rice that has not been pounded. It is usually filled or covered with sweet mung bean paste, red bean paste, raisins, or a sweet, creamy filling made with sesame seeds, pumpkin, beans, pine nuts, and honey. \"Tteok\" is usually eaten for dessert or as a snack.\nDining manners.\nThe oldest people are usually served first, and it is thought rude to pick up chopsticks or eat before the oldest people do so. In Korea, unlike in China and Japan, the rice bowl is not lifted up from the table. Spoons should not hit bowls while eating. You must not talk about dirty things. Some rules are now not important. For instance, talking used to be discouraged, but today people usually talk together at meals. Also, men usually ate at a different table than women, but now they eat all together. In Korea, they have both spoons and chopsticks, and together they are called \"sujeou\" (pronounced soo-juh - \uc218\uc800). Usually, before they eat, people say, \"Jalmukgessemnidah (\uc798 \uba39\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4)\", and after they are finished, they say, \"Jalmuggussemnidah (\uc798 \uba39\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4).\" Soups and stews must be set on the right side of the person who is eating.\nList of Korean dishes.\nGrain dishes.\nThese dishes are usually made with rice.\nSnacks or simple foods.\nThese simple foods can be bought at shops on the street and are usually thought of as snacks rather than meals."}

Typically, this involves finding a secret key. In non-technical language, this is the practice of codebreaking or cracking the code, although \"break\" can also mean just a part of a complete solution.\nPeople have been making and breaking codes for many centuries. In the 1930s specialized machines were invented to do the calculations. Code-breaking machines such as the Colossus computer were important during World War II. Computers were the main tool of cryptanalysis in the Cold War and later."}

When the country was again a Spanish colony, S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez was made the governor of the colony.\nHistory.\nThe territory of the province was part of the La Vega Province from the Dominican independence (in 1844) until 1945 when most of the territory was made part of the Duarte Province.\nOn 3 March 1952, the province was created with the territory of Cotu\u00ed, part at that moment of the Duarte Province, and the southeastern part of La Vega province. When it was created, it had only two municipalities: Cotu\u00ed, the provincial capital, and Cevicos. In 1961, Fantino became the third municipality of the province; in 2002, Villa La Mata became the fourth municipality.\nIn 1979, La Cueva became a municipal district; La Bija and Angelina in 2001; Quita Sue\u00f1o and Platanal in 2005; Hernando Alonzo, Caballero and Comedero Arriba in 2006; and Zambrana Abajo in 2010.\nLocation.\nThe S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez province is in the centre of the country, in the southeast limit of the Cibao Valley (part of the region called \"Eastern Cibao\"). It is bordered to the north by the Duarte province, to the east and south by the Monte Plata province, to the southwest and west by the Monse\u00f1or Nouel province and to the northwest by the La Vega province.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez province, and 85,207 () living in towns and cities.

It has of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 21st (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.\nThere are two regions in the province:\nThe altitude of Cotu\u00ed, provincial capital, is above sea level.\nThe most important river is the Yuna river, that flows from west to east; the other rivers are all tributaries of this river. Other rivers are Cevicos, Chacuey and Maguaca; they flow from the Sierra de Yamas\u00e1 into the River Yuna.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are 4 municipalities and 8 municipal districts (M.D.) in the province.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activities in the province are farming and mining. Close to the town of Las Lagunas, in the Sierra de Yamas\u00e1, are the gold mines.\nThe main products of farming in the Sierra de Yamas\u00e1 are cacao, oranges and tobacco. In the Yuna valley, rice is the most important product but pineapple and orange are also produced.\nCattle are also important in the province, mainly in the northwestern part of it."}

It had a distinct civilization (for example very fine and original ceramics have been found).\nThe site of Kerma includes both an extensive town and a cemetery consisting of large tumuli. Because one can find there much examples of Nubian culture and burial practices at the site, scholars think that the Egyptian statues and other Egyptian objects found at Kerma arrived through trade.\nIn 2003, a Swiss archaeological team working in northern Sudan uncovered one of the most remarkable Egyptological finds in recent years. At the site known as Kerma, near the third cataract of the Nile, archaeologist Charles Bonnet and his team discovered a ditch within a temple from the ancient city of Pnoubs, which contained seven monumental black granite statues. Magnificently sculpted, and in an excellent state of preservation, they portrayed five pharaonic rulers, including Taharqa and Tanoutamon, the last two pharaohs of the 'Nubian' Dynasty, when Egypt was ruled by kings from the lands of modern-day Sudan. For over half a century, the Nubian pharaohs governed a combined kingdom of Egypt and Nubia, with an empire stretching from the Delta to the upper reaches of the Nile."}

Cooper (also known as Dan Cooper) is an alias (false name) for a man who hijacked an airplane in November 24, 1971. At that time, airline passengers were not searched before boarding their planes. He carried a bomb onto a flight between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. He received the ransom payment of $200,000. He jumped from the airplane, which was a Boeing 727. When he jumped, the airplane was in the Pacific Northwest, perhaps over Woodland, Washington. Hundreds of suspects have been named through the years, but no conclusive evidence has surfaced regarding who Cooper was, or where he lived. The FBI believes he did not survive the jump. Several people have tried to explain what happened after the jump. Some of these explanations contradict each other.\nBecause no one expected he would jump and because little is known of what happened afterwards, people are still interested in the case. The Cooper case (code-named \"Norjak\" by the FBI) remains an unsolved mystery.\nThe case is famous for its lack of evidence. A few important clues have arisen, nevertheless. In late 1978, a placard, which had instructions on how to lower the rear stairs of a 727 was found just a few flying minutes north of Cooper's projected drop zone. It is believed that this is from the rear stairway of the plane from which Cooper jumped. In February 1980, eight-year-old Brian Ingram found $5,880 in decaying $20 bills on the banks of the Columbia River.\nIn October 2007, the FBI announced it was able to get a partial DNA profile of Cooper from the tie he left on the hijacked plane. The FBI warehouse had lost other material with his DNA. On December 31, 2007, the FBI revived the unclosed case: They published never before seen composite sketches and fact sheets online. They did this because some people might remember them, and help identify Cooper. In a press release, the FBI said that it still does not believe Cooper survived the jump, but wanted to know who Cooper was. In March 2008, the FBI announced that another possible clue was being investigated after a torn, tangled parachute was found within the bounds of Cooper's probable jump site near the town of Amboy, Washington. However, the FBI announced on April 1, 2008 that the parachute in question was not D. B. Cooper's. The man responsible for packing the four parachutes said that the recently discovered parachute was not Cooper's, as his was nylon, and the newly discovered parachute was silk, dating from the 1940s.\nNormally, the criminal laws cannot work against people years after their crimes (statute of limitations). In 1976, to prevent D. B. Cooper from escaping punishment, a Portland grand jury charged D. B. Cooper with crimes.\nSince 1999, Ariel, Washington holds an annual D. B. Cooper celebration on the anniversary of his jump.\nHe is said to be a \"disabled veteran\"."}

It affects red blood cells. It changes the cells from flexible disks into rigid crescents. When many red cells take this shape veins get blocked. This can cause damage to many organs. The organ damage increases with time and leads to an early death.\nThe disease.\nThis is a lifelong disease which starts in childhood. The red blood cells take up an abnormal, rigid, sickle shape. The cells also become sticky. This causes difficult blood flow when cells flow through long narrow capillaries. Low oxygen increases the problem. As they pass through low oxygen areas most cells take up this shape. The cells then stick to the inner wall of blood vessels, especially the branching point of veins. This leads to a blockade of blood flow in many organs. Severe complications may result.\nThe classic example of a sickle cell crisis is \"acute chest syndrome\"(ACS). This is unique to sicklers, and can cause death in a day or two unless treated. Historically, acute chest syndrome was considered different from infection (pneumonia). But in treatment there is not much point making that distinction.\nACS is a clinical diagnosis helped by at least one chest X-ray. In all other organs low oxygen causes widening of blood vessels. But the lung is a unique organ where blood vessels become narrower when oxygen is low. This unique problem makes the lung a major target of the disease. Fever is the most common symptom of ACS in children because infection is more common. In the adults circulating clots and broken pieces of bone marrow can also add to the blockage of vessels in the lung and lead to ACS. ACS can be partially treated by blood transfusion to dilute the sickled cells with some normal red blood cells. An even better treatment is a procedure called red blood cell exchange. Automated apheresis machines can do RBC exchange.\nA milder and more frequent problem is 'painful crisis'. Painful crisis involves flank, back and thigh pains that can be relieved by treatment. A painful crisis may evolve into worse problems such as acute chest and other organ failures e.g. strokes, heart attacks. Both strokes and heart attacks are general problems which may happen in older people. But in sickle patients these can happen even in the young.\nThe spleen is involved differently in different ethnic groups with this disease. Spleen is the organ which filters old RBCs and destroys them. Old RBCs are stiff and cannot pass through some very narrow slits in the spleen. But in sickle patients all cells very quickly become stiff and thus keep clogging up the spleen. Starting from a very young age segments of the spleen die because of this problem. In the pure form of this disease the whole spleen is dead and shrunken before the patient become adult. Normal spleen keeps a large store of B cells which make antibodies and protect us from bacteria. Loss of a working spleen leads to loss of protection from such bacteria.\nIn many Asian populations beta thalassaemia occurs together with sickle cell disease. Thalassemia itself is another form of anaemia. But the nature of the two disease are opposite. Thalassemia increases red cell flexibility. However, thalassemia itself can be a serious disease.\nPopulation genetics.\nThe sickling occurs because of a single point mutation in the gene for the beta chain of haemoglobin. Sickle-cell disease occurs more commonly in people (or their descendants) from parts of tropical and sub-tropical regions where malaria is or was common. One quarter of all people of Sub-Saharan African origin carry the gene.\nWe all inherit two copies (alleles) of the hemoglobin beta gene. One comes each parent. Some people are heterozygous: they have the sickle mutation in one copy and the other copy is normal. Such people are called sickle trait or a carrier. People with sickle trait are more resistant to malaria than normal people.\nWhen both alleles of a gene are similar (homozygous) a person has copies mutated or both normal. If both alleles have the mutation, it causes the full disease. In malaria prone areas, normal people die frequently of malaria often before they had children. Those with both copies with sickle mutation die of sickle disease before they can reproduce. But the heterozygotes have a better survival (and have more children) than both homozygous groups. Thus, the inheritance of the disease is an example of 'heterozygous advantage'.\nIn the full (homozygous) disease life expectancy is shortened, in fact it is near-fatal in pre-modern societies. Sir Cyril Clarke said (referring to East Africa in the 1960s) \"Almost all the children (with sickle-cell disease) will die in infancy\".p25. Studies in the modern U.S.A. report an average life expectancy of 42 years for males and 48 years for females."}

Every one of the world's major religions has sacred sites. Some religions, such as Islam, think of the sacred sites as being very important to their faith. In other religions such as Protestant Christianity, sacred sites are not so important.\nThe idea that a place is sacred often comes from something that has happened at the place, or a religious story about that place. Mount Sinai is a sacred site for Jews and Christians because it was on Mount Sinai that Moses received the Ten Commandments of God.\nThe \"sacred site\" might be a natural site, or it might be a building of some sort. One of the most famous natural sites that is also a sacred site is Uluru (also called Ayre's Rock) in Central Australia. It is believed to have been sacred to the aboriginal people for about 40,000 years. Other famous natural sites are the sacred trees of India, Japan and South East Asia.\nVery often, buildings have been made on natural sites that were already thought of as sacred. For example, a spring of water coming from the ground might be said to have healing powers. A special well-house might be built around the spring to protect it, and as a place where people might leave offerings (gifts to a god).\nOther sites are thought of as sacred because a holy person or saint lived there, or died there, or their body is kept there. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem is one of the most sacred sites to Christianity because it is believed that Jesus' body was placed in a tomb there. The city of Mecca is sacred to all Muslim people as the birthplace of the prophet Muhammad.\nPilgrimage.\nMany people make a special visit to a sacred site. This is called a pilgrimage. A person who travels on pilgrimage is called a \"pilgrim\". Pilgrimage is very important in Islam, because every Muslim person is expected to make a pilgrimage to the city of Mecca once in their lifetime, if they can possibly do so.\nMany Christians also make pilgrimages to sacred sites. Pilgrimage became very important in the Middle Ages when thousands of people travelled to many sacred sites, particularly to Jerusalem, to the famous Christian basilicas of Rome, to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain and Canterbury Cathedral in England. In modern times, sacred sites of Christian pilgrimage include Assisi in Italy, Lourdes in France, Fatima in Portugal and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City.\nIn Buddhism, the sacred sites are four places in India where Buddha lived and preached. These are Kapilavastu, Bodh Gaya, Benares and Kusinagara."}

He lived most of his life in the Electorate of Hanover, one of the many German countries that was part of the Holy Roman Empire. This area is today part of Germany. He married his cousin Sophia Dorothea (the daughter of his father's brother George William) in 1682.\nOn 10 November 1683, their first child and only son, George Augustus, was born. When George Louis was King of Great Britain, George Augustus was the Prince of Wales. When the father died, the son became king, as George II.\nOn 16 March 1687, their second child and only daughter was born. She was called Sophia Dorothea, after her mother. She later married and became the Queen in Prussia. Because she was married, she did not live in Britain with her father, but in Prussia with her husband.\nGeorge and his wife drifted apart, because he preferred his mistress Melusine, with whom he had three daughters, Anna, Melusine and Margaret. Meanwhile, his wife was having an affair with Count Philip Christopher of K\u00f6nigsmarck, who was found dead in a river, rumoured to have been murdered on George's orders.\nThe marriage was ended in 1694, on the grounds that Sophia Dorothea had effectively abandoned George. Sophia Dorothea's father, George William, and George Louis, had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden Castle in Celle, where she was unable to see her father, former husband, or children.\nIn 1698, his father died and George became the ruler (\"Prince-elector\") of Hanover.\nKing of Great Britain.\nWhen Queen Anne of Great Britain died in 1714, an act of parliament said the next ruler must be a Protestant. George was not the closest relative, but was the closest Protestant one. All the closer relatives were Roman Catholic, so George became King of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 August 1714. He was the first ruler of Great Britain from his family, the House of Hanover.\nMany of the British people did not like the new king. It is often said that he could not actually speak English. This may have been true at first, but he sometimes wrote in English later in his reign. George spent less time running the country than previous monarchs and allowed Parliament to have a bigger role. Later on, he left Robert Walpole in charge of running the country. Walpole became the first British prime minister, although the word \"prime minister\" was not used at the time.\nHe died while travelling from England to Hanover on 11 June 1727."}

Normally the immune system of the body is able to fight the germs and overcome the infection, but in sepsis something goes wrong. The pathogen was at some point able to get into the blood or tissues. The term sepsis is frequently used to refer to septicemia (blood poisoning). Septicemia is only one type of sepsis. Bacteremia specifically refers to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream (viremia and fungemia are the terms used for viruses and fungi). A sepsis is a medical emergency, as it can put the life in danger, if it is not acted on.\nSymptoms.\nCommon symptoms of sepsis are inflammations all over the body. This is often combined with high fever. Today, people believe, these symptoms are caused by the immune system trying to fight the disease. Because of the strong reactions, organs can be damaged in the process. In a sense, the immune system over-reacts the germs and goes awry, causing damage to the organs.\nCause of death.\nIn the United States, sepsis is the leading cause of death for ICU patients which do not have heart problems. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows it is the tenth most common cause of death overall. Older people, those with a weak immune system and those with a strong illness suffer from sepis more often. It is also more dangerous to them. It occurs in 1%-2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization. It is a major cause of death in intensive care units worldwide, with mortality rates that range from 20% for sepsis to 40% for \"severe sepsis\" to over 60% for \"septic shock\".\nMore severe forms.\nSevere sepsis and septic shock are more severe forms of sepsis. With severe sepsis, one or more organs fail to work. Septic shock is when sepsis is combined with very low blood pressure.\nTreatment.\nToday, the bacterial forms of sepsis can be treated with antibiotics. In addition, the fluids (blood) containing the germs have to be replaced. It might also be necessary to functionally replace the organs that failed. It is important to begin to treat the sepsis as quickly as possible, as each hour it is left untreated will raise the chances of death by 5% to 10%.\nAbout half the people affected and untreated die from the condition. Rapid access to treatment will increase the chances of survival in most cases."}

In 2018, she was elected as Commonwealth Chair-in-Office.\nOn 12 December 2018, 48 Conservative MPs had submitted letters of no confidence to the Chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady, triggering a vote of no confidence. Despite this, May won the confidence vote after 200 MPs vowed support to her leadership. On 15 January 2019 after her Brexit proposal failed in the House of Commons by a 432 to 202 vote, Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn filled a motion of no confidence in her ministry, which failed in a 325 to 306 vote.\nIn March 2019, May said she would resign as Prime Minister if Parliament passed her Brexit deal, to make way for a new leader in the second phase of Brexit.\nOn 24 May 2019, she announced that her resignation as party leader would take effect on 7 June and she would leave her position as Prime Minister when her replacement is selected. She was replaced by Boris Johnson.\nEarly life.\nMay was born on 1 October 1956 at Maternity Home in 9 Upperton Road in Eastbourne, Sussex. May is the only child of Zaidee Mary (n\u00e9e Barnes; 1928\u20131982) and Hubert Brasier (1917\u20131981). Her father was a Church of England clergyman. May was educated at Oxfordshire primary and grammar schools in the State sector, and graduated the University of Oxford in 1977.\nEarly career.\nFrom 1977 and 1983 May worked at the Bank of England, and from 1985 to 1997 as a financial consultant and senior advisor in International Affairs at the Association for Payment Clearing Services. May's parents died during this period, her father in a car accident in 1981 and her mother of multiple sclerosis a year later. May served as a councillor for the London Borough of Merton from 1986 to 1994, where she was Chairman of Education (1988\u201390) and Deputy Group Leader and Housing Spokesman (1992\u201394).\nEarly political work.\nShe first became a Conservative Party MP at the 1997 general election and was promoted to the shadow cabinet in 1999. She held several positions in the shadow cabinet, including Chairman of the Conservative Party (July 2002-November 2003) and Shadow Leader of the House of Commons (December 2005-January 2009).\nHome Secretary (2010-2016).\nShe became the Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equality on 12 May 2010.\nIn December 2010, May declared that deployment of water cannon by police forces in mainland Britain was an operational decision which had been \"resisted until now by senior police officers.\" She rejected their use following the widespread rioting in Summer 2011. In 2010, May promised to bring the level of net migration down to less than 100,000. In February 2015, \"The Independent\" reported, \"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014\u2014up from 210,000 in the previous year.\"\nAt the Conservative Party Conference on 4 October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, \"because\u2014and I am not making this up\u2014he had a pet cat\".\nIn May 2012, she said she supported same-sex marriage. She recorded a video for the Out4Marriage campaign.\nIn July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant khat, against the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The council said that there was \"insufficient evidence\" it caused health problems.\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom (2016-19).\n2016 Conservative Party leadership election.\nMay was a candidate in the upcoming election for leadership of the Conservative Party. May described herself as a candidate who will unify the party after a 'divisive' referendum (Brexit). She won the first ballot on 5 July 2016 by a large margin with 50% of the votes. On 7 July, May won the votes of 199 MPs, facing the vote of Conservative Party members in a contest with Andrea Leadsom.\nLeadsom's withdrawal from the contest on 11 July led to May being set to be appointed party leader and hence, Prime Minister, an office she assumed on 13 July 2016.\nEarly days.\nAfter being appointed by the Queen on 13 July 2016, May became the United Kingdom's second female Prime Minister, after Margaret Thatcher. She is the first female Prime minister of the 21st century.\nMay told the media on 12 July 2016 that she was \"honoured and humbled\" to be the party leader and to become prime minister. Responding to some calls for a general election (reported by the news media) to confirm her mandate, \"sources close to Mrs May\" said there would be no such election according to the BBC.\nA big issue May had to tackle during her premiership is Brexit, after Britain voted to leave the European Union. May has led talks with the European Union to plan how the split will happen.\nMay has also dealt with the war in Iraq and Syria. She has used Britain's military to fight ISIS in both countries. British troops have been in the Battle of Mosul, helping Iraq's military and the Kurdish forces.\nGeneral election, 2017.\nOn 18 April 2017 Theresa May surprised people by saying she wanted to have a snap general election on 8 June . The next day the House of Commons voted in favour of holding the general election in June.\nAt the start of the campaign the Conservatives had a large lead in the polls. As the campaign went on, the Labour Party gained more support and started to rise in the polls. On the day of the election the Conservatives did worse than expected and May lost her majority in the House of Commons.\nVote of no confidence.\nOn 12 December 2018, the chairman of the 1922 committee received enough formal request letters to warrant what some Westminster system countries call a Leadership spill, which was promptly scheduled for the following evening. Many say this is because of the Brexit deal and the way May is handling the deal. Before the vote, May said later that day that she would not lead her party in the next general election. May would go on to win the confidence vote.\nBrexit defeat.\nOn 15 January 2019 Theresa May's government was defeated in the house of commons by a majority of 203 in a vote on her deal to leave the European Union. This is the largest majority against a United Kingdom government ever.\nResignation.\nOn 24 May 2019, May announced that she would resign as Conservative Party leader effective on 7 June and that she will remain as Prime Minister until her replacement is picked.\nIn the 2019 General Election she was re-elected in her Maidenhead constituency.\nPersonal life.\nShe married Philip John May on 6 September 1980. She has no children.\nIn 2013, she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.\nMay is a member of the Church of England and regularly worships at church on Sunday."}

Bill Fagerbakke plays him. Patrick first appeared in the series' pilot episode, \"Help Wanted\", which played on May 1, 1999. Patrick was made by animator Stephen Hillenburg. Patrick's biggest character trait is his lack of common sense, which sometimes makes him a bad influence on his best friend, SpongeBob SquarePants.\nRole in \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\nPatrick is as a pink starfish who is silly, fat, lazy, immature, forgetful, rude, and generally ignorant. He has been shown to make many silly mistakes such as forgetting how to eat, and not realizing that the character Sandy Cheeks is a girl. But, he sometimes is shown to overly observe particular events happening around him. At those moments, he would focus on very specific objects or details that other characters would usually ignore. However, he always quickly turns back to his usual, silly self after. He does not have a job. But, he worked at the Krusty Krab for short periods of time in many positions (often was not paid), and mostly spends his days either goofing off with SpongeBob or resting beneath the rock. He lives under the rock. At home, Patrick is usually either sleeping (stuck to the bottom of his rock), watching TV (whether the TV is actually on or not), or doing the \"art of doing nothing.\" He is very good at that. All of the furniture under his rock are made of sand, and Patrick can simply build new furniture as needed. But even so, his living space contains only the most basic things. His best friend SpongeBob is often impressed by Patrick's ability to come up with silly yet genius plans or solutions. But, Patrick often irritates those around him and is confused by the simplest questions or subjects. The characters of Mr. Krabs and Squidward Tentacles have no patience for Patrick's stupidity. They don't pay him much regard. Sandy Cheeks often gets annoyed by Patrick, but still sees him as a friend.\nDevelopment.\n\"SpongeBob SquarePants\" maker Stephen Hillenburg began making cartoons and caricatures of tide pool-dwelling sea life, including starfish, while teaching marine biology at the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point, California, from 1984 to 1987. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute. This is so he could become an animator. Patrick Star is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke.\nReception.\nCriticism and controversy.\nIn 2005, a video that involves SpongeBob promoting diversity and tolerance was criticized by a Christian evangelical group in the United States because they saw the character was being used for homosexual people, but the video had \"no reference to sex, sexual lifestyle or sexual identity.\"\nThis made questions about whether or not SpongeBob, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the series' characters are homosexual characters. In 2002, Hillenburg said that his characters were not gay. He clarified the issue and said \"We never made them gay on purpose. I think they are almost asexual. We are just trying to be funny and this has got nothing to do with the show.\"\nJeffrey P. Dennis, writer of the journal article \"The Same Thing We Do Every Night: Signifying Same-Sex Desire in Television Cartoons,\" argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not in love, while adding that he believed that SpongeBob and Patrick \"are paired with arguably big intensity.\" Dennis noted the two are \"not thought of as romantic partners,\" since they live in separate places, and have different groups of friends, but claimed that in the series, \"the possibility of same-sex desire is never excluded.\" Martin Goodman of \"Animation World Magazine\" described Dennis's comments regarding SpongeBob and Patrick as \"interesting.\""}

He was the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government and was also the leader of the Liberal Democrats. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Sheffield Hallam.\nNick Clegg was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 to 2004 and was first elected as a Liberal Democrat MP in the 2005 general election. He became the leader of the Liberal Democrats in December 2007. Following the 2010 General Election, he was made Deputy Prime Minister after a coalition deal with the Conservative Party. He resigned as party leader in 2015 after the May 2015 election because of the party's poor election results.\nPersonal life.\nClegg has been married to Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez since 2000; they have three sons. Durantez is a Spanish Roman Catholic. Their children are being raised as Catholics, even though Clegg is an atheist.\nClegg's family has many foreign members- his grandmother on his father's side was a Russian Baroness before the Russian Revolution, with German and Ukrainian ancestors, while Clegg's Dutch mother was imprisoned by the Japanese in World War II. Clegg is multilingual (he speaks Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish fluently). He says that his family's experience of persecution is one of the reasons he is liberal.\nBefore becoming a politician.\nClegg was born in Buckinghamshire. He went to Caldicott primary school and Westminster secondary school. He spent a gap year working as a skiing instructor in Austria before starting university at Robinson College, Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology.\nAfter his degree, he was given a scholarship to study for a Master's degree at the University of Minnesota. He then worked as an intern for Christopher Hitchens in New York for a while before going to Brussels to work for the European Union as a trainee aid organiser. He then studied for a second Master's at the College of Europe in Bruges where he met Durantez.\nFrom 1994 to 1998, he worked at the European Commission, where he developed aid programmes to the former Soviet Union and helped the World Trade Organisation to negotiate the entries of Russia and China.\nAs an MEP.\nIn 1999, Clegg was elected as the Member of the European Parliament for the East Midlands. As an MEP, he helped to start a campaign for greater accountability in the European Parliament.\nIn 2004, he left the Parliament in order to campaign for the Sheffield Hallam constituency seat in the 2005 General Election. During the campaign, he worked as a part-time lecturer at the University of Sheffield.\nAs an MP.\nClegg won the 2005 election, and became the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hallam in May 2005. As an MP, he campaigned to change the prison and immigration systems, and to make sure that the government did not take away too much freedom from people in their work against terrorism. He said that the Iraq War was wrong.\nIn 2007, he was voted as leader of the Liberal Democrats, and in 2008 he joined the Privy Council, a group of advisors to the British Monarch. .\nAs leader of the Liberal Democrats, Clegg's main policies have been to get rid of the Trident missile system, to give NHS patients the choice of private medical care, to make the length of time between elections 5 years (at the moment it only has a 5-year limit, meaning that the government can begin a new election at any time), giving more power to local government, tax cuts for the poor and for the government to do more about the environment.\nIn May 2009, the Liberal Democrats' approval ratings were higher than the Labour Party's for the first time since 1987.\nClegg lost his seat in the 2017 general election.\nAs Deputy Prime Minister.\nIn May 2010, the UK had a General Election which did not produce a clear winner. David Cameron, leader of the Conservative Party, who had got the most votes, asked to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. Clegg accepted, and became Deputy Prime Minister.\nIn July 2010, he revealed plans to have 50 fewer MPs in Parliament, to change the number of MPs needed to begin a new election without the agreement of the Prime Minister to 65% and to hold a referendum on whether or not to change the system of voting in General Elections.\nAfter the government revealed plans to drastically cut government spending, Liberal Democrat approval ratings dropped to 14%, almost half the 34% rating that was recorded in April 2010."}

From the early 1970s, role-playing games have been played by people sitting together at the same table, using their imaginations and the written rules of the game to play (as well as dice to generate random numbers when needed). \nPlayers of this type of role-playing game play as imaginary characters that go on heroic adventures. The characters can be many types: a strong warrior, a wise wizard, a skilled thief. One person in the group acts as a moderator, or referee (called the \"dungeon master,\" or DM, in Dungeons and Dragons and \"game master\", or GM, in other games), of the game. This person is responsible for making sure there is a fair use of the rules and is often also in charge of designing fun, interesting adventures for the other players.\nThere are now many types of fantasy role-playing games, both traditional paper-and-pencil games and computer games. Many genres of games are played (fantasy, science fiction, horror, war, and so on), and there are hundreds of companies that produce their own written rules systems and software products.\nVersions of Dungeons and Dragons.\nSeveral versions of Dungeons and Dragons have been released. The first version was just called \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\" Several rule books were available, depending on the levels of the characters. The first books dealt with characters from levels 1-3. As characters got stronger, players had to move to the more advanced rule books to manage their characters.\nAfter Dungeons and Dragons came Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. This was a new ruleset that was unrelated to the original rules. A second edition of AD&amp;D was released, which is still popular today.\nAfter Wizards of the Coast bought the rights to Dungeons and Dragons, a more streamlined version of the game was released, called Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition. This version had simpler rules. Most die-rolls were done with a 20 sided die, instead of different types of multi-sided dice. \nThe 3rd edition rules were eventually revised, and version 3.5 was released. \nThe 4th edition rules were published in June 2008. \nThe 5th edition rules were published, after a two year testing period, in late 2014. \nPlaying Dungeons and Dragons.\nBefore playing the game, each player makes his or her character and writes the details on a \"character sheet.\" First, players make their character's six statistics called \"ability scores\": Strength (How strong you are), Dexterity (How skilled and fast you are), Constitution (How tough you are), Intelligence (How smart you are), Wisdom (How well you use your smarts), and Charisma (How well you control and influence people). Each version has different methods to make the stats.\nEach player then selects a race (species) such as human or elf, as well as a class (job or occupation) such as Fighter or Wizard, and their alignment (Their moral and ethical views). Players also invest in a number of skills, feats and powers to make their characters stronger and better. Adding details not covered by the rules like history and personality are used often to develop the character.\nWhile playing Dungeons and Dragons, the players detail the actions of their characters to the referree, such as hitting an enemy or hiding from the guards, or talking to another character. The referree describes the results of the characters' actions or answers the players. Actions that are really easy will always work, like when opening an unlocked door or picking up an apple. The results of hard actions are decided by rolling dice.\nAs the game is played, the characters grow and increase in power. Characters may gain experience, skills, wealth. The main way that characters gain experience is through defeating powerful enemies or doing an important or hard work. Getting enough experience allows a character to get a level, getting more job abilities, skills, and powers.\nHit points (HP) measure a character's health. When a character is harmed, s/he loses hit points. When a character loses all of his or her hitpoints, s/he dies. To avoid being harmed, most characters can wear armor of different types. You might also use \"Saving Throws\" against indirect harm, such as poison, or magical effects.\nThe story is a combined effort of everyone who plays. It can either be a story someone has made up. So can the setting (Where the adventure takes place). There are also books that give all that information as well."}

It was still illegal to leave Japan until the Meiji Restoration (1868).\nBut Japan was not completely isolated under the \"sakoku\" policy.

The rule says to replace (or \"substitute\") each letter with another letter from the alphabet. \nFor instance, this table gives a rule for a substitution cipher:\nUsing this rule, the sentence \"Jack and Jill went up the hill\" is changed to \"Etar tzn Evmm gkzc dw cuk uvmm\". The Caesar cipher is one example of a substitution cipher.\nSubstitution ciphers are not safe enough to use for important messages. Substitution ciphers can be broken by an idea called \"frequency analysis\". Some letters are more common than others in English sentences: \"E\" is the most common, then \"T\", then \"A\", and so on. A message that has been changed by a substitution cipher will have different common letters, but this gives a hint about the rule. The most common letters in the changed message are likely to be the most common letters in English. Breaking \"cryptograms\" (messages hidden with a substitution cipher) is a common puzzle often found in newspapers.\nExample.\nSuppose the changed message is:\n LIVITCSWPIYVEWHEVSRIQMXLEYVEOIEWHRXEXIPFEMVEWHKVSTYLXZIXLIKIIXPIJVSZEYPERRGERIM\n WQLMGLMXQERIWGPSRIHMXQEREKIETXMJTPRGEVEKEITREWHEXXLEXXMZITWAWSQWXSWEXTVEPMRXRSJ\n GSTVRIEYVIEXCVMUIMWERGMIWXMJMGCSMWXSJOMIQXLIVIQIVIXQSVSTWHKPEGARCSXRWIEVSWIIBXV\n IZMXFSJXLIKEGAEWHEPSWYSWIWIEVXLISXLIVXLIRGEPIRQIVIIBGIIHMWYPFLEVHEWHYPSRRFQMXLE\n PPXLIECCIEVEWGISJKTVWMRLIHYSPHXLIQIMYLXSJXLIMWRIGXQEROIVFVIZEVAEKPIEWHXEAMWYEPP\n XLMWYRMWXSGSWRMHIVEXMSWMGSTPHLEVHPFKPEZINTCMXIVJSVLMRSCMWMSWVIRCIGXMWYMXXLIYSPH\n KTY\nFor this example, capital letters are used for unknown letters, and lowercase letters are used to denote letters we know or can guess. \nBy counting up the letters, we see that the most common is I, which we will guess is an e.

However, ballpoint pens are cheaper and simpler to use than pens that need to be dipped in ink. The old kind are still used in calligraphy.\nThe ink in a ballpoint is different from the ink used in a dip or fountain pen. It is a paste. It has 25 to 40 per cent dye suspended in a solvent of \"oil\". The most common oils are benzyl alcohol or phenoxyethanol, which mix with the dyes to create a smooth paste that dries quickly. Common dyes in blue (and black) ink are Prussian blue, Victoria blue, methyl violet, crystal violet and phthalocyanine blue. The dye eosin is commonly used for red ink. \nBiros have the advantage of being very cheap, and easily portable. As a gel or paste, the dye does not run and is stable.

The notebook, dropped on earth by a bored shinigami named Ryuk, is called a \"Death Note\". When a person's name is written in the notebook, that person dies. If the cause of death is not specified, they die of a heart attack. Light, aiming to create a crime-free utopia, uses the notebook to kill criminals, anonymously gaining world fame as \"Kira\" (\"\u30ad\u30e9\" in Japanese - based on the English word \"killer\") - some people see him as justice, while others see him as a murderer.\nThe best detective in the world, an eccentric genius named \"L\", works with the Japanese police, as well as Light's own father, to find out Kira's identity and catch him. He suspects all along that it's Light, who, as a part of the police department, works alongside L in the investigation. It becomes a contest of wit and intelligence between L and Light, both of whom are very clever. At one point, Light temporarily gives up the Death Note, along his memories of it, as an ally continue writing the names of criminals. This \"proves\" to the police that he is not Kira. However, he later gets the Death Note back and kills L with it.\nAfter L dies, his successors, two orphans named \"Mello\" and \"Near\", take over the Kira investigation. Near is a child prodigy who clearly mirrors L, and Mello is an impulsive, antisocial teen obsessed with one-upping Near. Mello refuses to work with Near and leaves the orphanage, joining the American Mafia; Near forms a task force to catch Kira. In the end, Near proves that Light is Kira, leading to Light's death.\nBesides the manga and anime, Death Note was also made into a light novel, various video games, two animated films, a live-action television drama, a musical, and several live-action films."}

He was born in Kaysersberg (Alsace), at the time a part of the German Empire.\nHe wrote books about music and religion. He started a famous hospital in Lambarene, Africa. He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize.\nEarlier life.\nAlbert Schweitzer was born in Kaysersberg (Alsace), on 14 January 1875. He lived in the village of Gunsbach, where his father was a local pastor. His father taught him how to play music. In 1893, Schweitzer passed his Baccalaureat.\nAfter this, Schweitzer went to Paris to learn philosophy and music, before returning to his birthplace to study theology. He spent nine years studying medicine and surgery. He would dedicate his life to helping people and curing diseases.\nMusic.\nSchweitzer was a famous organist and was extremely interested in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. He developed a simple style of performance, which he thought to be closer to what Bach had meant. In 1908, he completed the final version of his book \"Johann Sebastian Bach\". In the book, he argued for the new style, which has had great influence on the way Bach\u2019s music is now treated. \nWhen Schweitzer was in Lambarene, his main recreation was to play Bach\u2019s music. He also gave musical performances to raise money for medical supplies in Gabon.\nRecordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD. Between 1934 and 1935, he had a trial recording for HMV on the organ of the old Queen's Hall in London. In mid-December 1935, he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All-Hallows-by-the-Tower, Barking, London.\nTheology and Philosophy.\nSchweitzer became well known for his books on Jesus and Christianity. He was not so much interested in the historical study of Jesus, as in the Christian idea of the end of the world, which can be found in the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. Schweitzer also served as a minister for Saint Nicholas Church in Strassburg.\nIn the philosophy of Albert Schweitzer, the most important idea is the respect for life. In his book \"The Philosophy of Civilization\", he wrote that \"true philosophy\" begins with the idea that: \nAlbert Schweitzer\u2019s ethical principles meant that he tried to have a personal and spiritual relationship with the universe. It also meant that he was vegetarian.\nSchweitzer in Africa.\nAlbert Schweitzer spent most of his life in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, Africa. In 1904, he was inspired to help sick people in the world, so he studied medicine. After his medical studies in 1913, he went to Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 with his wife to establish a hospital that would serve thousands of Africans.\nDuring World War I, the French made Schweitzer and his wife, both Germans, leave Africa. In 1924, he returned to Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 and managed to rebuild the destroyed hospital, where he served as a physician .\nLater life.\nFrom 1939-1948, he stayed in Lambarene since he could not go to Europe during the war. Three years later he resumed his medical practices. But he was no longer just a medical doctor and whenever possible he went to Europe to lecture at universities. Slowly his ideas become known, not only in Europe but worldwide. \nIn 1952 Dr Albert Schweitzer was awarded The Nobel Prize for peace. He gave a famous speech \"The Problem of Peace\". He died on 4 September 1965 at his hospital in Lambarene."}

The population was 8,352 at the 2005 census estimate.\nHistory.\nBefore statehood, when the Five Tribes or Five Civilized Tribes were moved to Oklahoma from the Eastern United States, the area that is now Coweta became part of the Creek Nation. Coweta was named after a Creek Indian war town on the Chattahoochee River in southwestern Georgia and was first settled by American Indians about 1840. In 1843 Robert Loughridge arrived in the area and established a mission, named \"Koweta\".\nIn 1867 after the Civil War, the Creek Indians adopted a constitution which divided there nation into six districts. Everything northeast of the Arkansas River, including Tulsa, became the Coweta district. The political center of this district was in a log courthouse on Coweta Creek, about a one-fourth of a mile west from the modern day center of the downtown Coweta. The Post Office was established on May 24, 1897, and was named after the Koweta Mission.\nMany notable events occurred in 1903. Along with the arrival of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, Coweta\u2019s first newspaper, \"The Courier\", was started, the first school was built, and a telephone line was put in.\nGeography.\nCoweta is at (35.963155, -95.661586).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.7\u00a0square miles (19.9\u00a0km\u00b2), of which, 7.6\u00a0square miles (19.6\u00a0km\u00b2) of it is land and 0.1\u00a0square miles (0.3\u00a0km\u00b2) of it (1.56%) is water.\nHistorical sites.\nCoweta is home to two sites on the National Register of Historic Places list. The first is the Koweta Mission Site. The mission was added to the NRHP in 1973, today only a cemetery remains. The second historical site in Coweta is the First Presbyterian Church of Coweta, commonly known as the Mission Bell Museum. The Mission Bell Museum was added to the NRHP in 2003 and is owned and operated by the city of Coweta."}

Usually rodents get it. It is caused by a bacterium, \"Francisella tularensis\". There have been cases where the disease spread to humans. The disease can be treated with antibiotics.\nTularemia as a biological weapon.\nCases of tularemia should be reported to the local health authority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention think \"F. tularensis\" could possibly be a bioweapons agent. For this reason, it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the USA, USSR and Japan at various times. A former Soviet biological weapons scientist, Kenneth Alibek, has said that an outbreak of Tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the siege of Stalingrad was due to intentional release of F. tularensis by Soviet forces, but this claim is rejected by others who have studied the outbreak. In the USA, practical research into using Tularemia as a bioweapon took place at Camp Detrick in the 1950s. It was viewed as an attractive agent because:\nBy the late 1950s the US biological warfare program was focused mostly on tularemia as a biological agent. The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the M143 bursting spherical bomblet. It was a lethal biological with an anticipated fatality rate of 40 to 60 percent. The rate-of-action was around three days, with a duration-of-action of one to three weeks (treated) and two to three months (untreated) with frequent relapses. UL was streptomycin resistant. The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern, being sensitive to sun light, and losing virulence over time after release.\nThe United States later changed the military symbol for UL to TT (wet-type) and ZZ (dry-type) in an effort to retain security on the identity of military biologicals. When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT (an incapacitant rather than lethal agent), the Schu S4 strain's symbol was changed again to SR.\nNo vaccine is available to the general public. The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs (as rabbits), avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources, and wearing long-sleeved clothes and using an insect repellent to prevent tick bites.\nDocumented outbreaks.\nIn summer 2000, an outbreak of tularemia in Martha's Vineyard resulted in one dead person. It brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized \"Francisella tularensis\". Over the following summers, Martha's Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing. The research may prove valuable in preventing bioterrorism.\nAn outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999-2000.\nIn 2004, three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with \"F. tularensis\", after apparently failing to follow safety procedures.\nIn 2005, small amounts of \"F. tularensis\" were detected in the Mall area of Washington, DC the morning after an anti-war demonstration on September 24, 2005. Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall. To this date, no cases of tularemia infection have been reported as a result.\nIn 2007, a lab of Boston University's Center for Advanced Biomedical Research, where \"F. tularensis\" were being kept for research, was evacuated after smoke set off alarms. An investigation has later determined that an electrical problem was the culprit, and no bacterial contamination was found.\nIn July 2007, an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and Le\u00f3n and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region."}

Born and raised in Vienna, he began writing at an early age. He started sending in stories to magazines in the 1980s, and also published articles and books about computer software after 1989. Ebner's poetry is written in German and Catalan. He is a member of several Austrian writers associations, including the Grazer Autorenversammlung.\nHis works include cultural essays on Catalan topics, and stories about Jewish traditions. His first book of short stories was printed in 2007. In 2008, Ebner published the short novel \"Hominide\". He has gotten several literary prizes, among them the Viennese \"Wiener Werkstattpreis\" in 2007. Austrian critics, such as Wolfgang Ratz, have praised Ebner's prose-style. The writer lives in Vienna with his family.\nBiography.\nIn the 1980s, he studied Romance languages, German and Translation at the University of Vienna. He also worked for a literary group and a magazine for literature in Vienna. Afterwards he worked as a translator, language teacher and IT project manager. In the 1990s, he published articles and books about software and computer networks; these books were in German, but he also wrote articles in English. In 2001 he wrote a university paper about islamism in Europe, which has been published later in Germany.\nAfter school, Klaus Ebner has begun to write short stories, poetry and radio dramas. He usually published them in magazines of literature and culture. After the year 2004, he published literary texts much more often. Today, Klaus Ebner is an author of fiction (novels, short stories), essays and poems. He writes poetry in German and Catalan. Supported by the Austrian government, he went to Andorra in 2007 and wrote an essay about the country in the Pyrenees.\nIn 2007, Ebner's poem \"a paperman and sick\" became one of the Mentioned Poems at the International Poetry Prize Nosside. The jury spoke about the \"sadness in big cities\", which would be represented in the poem by a \"paperman\" whose \"meal consists of loneliness\". The English translation of the poem goes as follows:\nIn 2008 Klaus Ebner got the Wiener Werkstattpreis of 2007. The winning short story \"Der Fl\u00fcgel Last (The Burden of the Wings)\" shows a seven year old girl who has cancer. The story is told as if the girl would tell it herself. In the winning essay \"Was blieb vom Wei\u00dfen Ritter? (What do we still have of the White Knight?)\", the reader learns about the novel from the Middle Ages \"Tirant lo Blanch\" by Joanot Martorell from Valencia. The author mixed his own reading experience with information from history and literature.\nKlaus Ebner is a member of the Austrian Writers' Associations \"Grazer Autorenversammlung (GAV)\" and \"\u00d6sterreichischer Schriftstellerverband (\u00d6SV)\".\nStyle of writing.\nEbner's short stories have many different topics, which, as critic Julia Rafael says, include actual and socially relevant problems. She describes the stories included in the anthology \"Lose\" as \"somewhat imploding\" and says that \"phantasms, irony and humor have their place, too\". Ebner's metaphors have been described as \"going beyond reality without losing ground\". The journalist Paul C. Jezek said, Ebner's writing style is characterized by very carefully chosen wording. Each sentence has a melody; his short prose especially sounds lyrical. Jezek compares Ebner's sentences to \"Japanese paintings \u2013 every word has been chosen with special care\". Austrian writer and critic Wolfgang Ratz made a similar observation, underlining \"the accurateness of Ebner's speech\" and \"his love for formal details\", while pinpointing the sarcastic undertone of the critical stories."}

He played college football for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles. Favre was known for his controversy as well, especially his retirement saga and sexual abuse scandal with New York and failure to cooperate in the investigation, for which he was fined $50 thousand. Favre is also well known for his love of the outdoors and his \"iron man\" reputation earned for his toughness, which helped him in cold Wisconsin and Minnesota. He was a color anylst for one 2011 college game.\nChildhood.\nBrett weighed 9 pounds 15 ounces when he was born on Oct. 10, 1969. He had several brothers with whom he played baseball and football.\nCollege.\nFavre started at the quarterback position for The University of Southern Mississippi for four solid years.\nProfessional career.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nFavre was chosen in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. He threw two interceptions.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nOn February 10, 1992, after a season with the Falcons, he was traded to the Green Bay Packers on for the 19th pick in the 1992 NFL Draft. He became the Packers' starting quarterback in 1992, then started every game after the 1992 season until the end of the 2007 season with the Packers. He was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXI, which was especially notable because Favre was previously addicted to pain killers that he took. On November 4, 2007, Favre became the third to beat the other 31 teams after beating the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. The 2008 NFC Championship game against the New York Giants would be Brett Favre's last game as a Packer in which the Pack lost in overtime when Favre threw an interception. The interception is Favre's last pass as a Packer. Despite many interceptions, Favre had a great career with Green Bay. In 2008 he said that he would retire, but later changed his mind before the 2008 season start. The Packers stuck with the decision to start a younger player, Aaron Rodgers, as their quarterback.\nNew York Jets.\nFavre was dealt to the New York Jets. He and the Jets started off the season well, but Favre got hurt down the stretch. That injury was not reported by the Jets, who had to pay a $125,000 fine. Favre ended the season with 22 touchdown passes and 22 interceptions.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nHe retired again after the season, but came out of retirement another time to play for the Minnesota Vikings for the 2009 season. Favre actually had the best statistical season of his career in 2009, throwing for 34 touchdowns next to seven interceptions for Minnesota. However, his season ended with an interception by Tracy Porter in a loss to the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship. After this, he decided to play for the Vikings in 2010 as well, but threw only 11 touchdowns next to 19 interceptions as he and the franchise struggled. Favre was often injured, and retired for good after the season ended.\nRecords.\nFavre started 297 games in a row at quarterback from 1992 to 2010. He became the first quarterback to lead his team to victory over all of the NFL's 32 teams after defeating the Chiefs on November 4, 2007. Seven years later, Peyton Manning would accomplish this feet after defeating the Indianapolis Colts (his former team), in their opener. In 2007 against the Vikings, he also threw his 421st career touchdown pass, setting another record.\nFavre away from football.\nPersonal.\nDespite contoversy, Favre also has an interesting personal life. He is an endorser (does commercials/advertisements) for Wrangler Jeans and is famous for his love of the outdoors. Favre is married and even has a grandson. He is active with charity, as he started the Favre Fourward Foundation.\nAfter Last Retirement.\nIn 2012, Favre started a Twitter account, which Favre later claimed (said) was hacked.\nAlso in 2012, a New Orleans Saints play for pay program was exposed. Former New Orleans defensive coodinator Gregg Williams had paid players to deliver especially hard and/or illegal hits on an opposing player. Such activity is against NFL rules. Favre had taken some especially hard hits with the Vikings against the Saints, especially in the NFC Championship loss in 2009. Favre said that he was not angry, but instead \"happy that the truth came out.\""}

The density of this element is 231.04\nNotable characteristics.\nProtactinium is a silver metallic element that is in the actinide group, with a bright metallic shine that it keeps for some time in the air. It is superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 K.\nApplications.\nDue to its scarcity, high radioactivity and toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of basic research.\nProtactinium-231 (which is made by the alpha decay of Uranium-235 followed by beta decay of Thorium-231) could possibly sustain a nuclear chain reaction and might be used to build a nuclear weapon. The critical mass, according to Walter Seifritz, is 750\u00b1180 kg. Other authors conclude that no chain reactions are possible in Protactinium-231.\nHistory.\nProtactinium was first discovered in 1913, when Kasimir Fajans and O. H. G\u00f6hring encountered short-lived isotope 234m-Pa, with a half-life of about 1.17 minutes, while they were studying the decay chain of 238-U. They gave the new element the name \"Brevium\" (Latin \"brevis\", brief, short); the name was changed to \"Protoactinium\" in 1918 when two groups of scientists (Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of the UK) independently discovered 231-Pa. The name was shortened to \"Protactinium\" in 1949.\nIn 1961, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority was able to produce 125 g of 99.9% pure protactinium, processing 60 tons of waste material in a 12-stage process and spending 500,000 USD. For many years to come, this was the world's only way to get the element. It is said that the metal was sold to laboratories for a cost of 2,800 USD / g in the following years.\nPrecautions.\nProtactinium is both toxic and highly radioactive. It requires precautions similar to those used when handling plutonium."}

He is a red monster, and has his own part of the show called \"Elmo's World\". His age is 3 years old. He is very famous for his laugh. His best friend is an orange monster named Zoe.\nElmo was originally a nameless extra performed by various puppeteers with no established identity. After that, he became a recurring character on the show. Brian Muehl was the first main performer and gave him a whispery voice. Richard Hunt performed him next and gave him a gruff voice. However, Kevin Clash was given the muppet in 1984 and used a new voice for him. This voice was made using falsetto. The muppet then became very popular. Elmo always talks in third person: for example, Elmo says \"Elmo knows where you live!\" rather than \"I know where you live!\" Elmo has a pet fish named Dorothy. He plays the toy piano and likes to ride his tricycle. Elmo is very popular with younger children.\nIn the 1990s, an Elmo toy called \"Tickle Me Elmo\" was sold. In a short time, it became one of the most popular \"Sesame Street\" toys in stores."}
