Alcohol is poisonous to a fetus and can cause brain damage. Drinking alcohol while pregnant can cause the fetus to get fetal alcohol syndrome.\nIllegal drugs, like heroin and cocaine, are also poisonous to the fetus and can cause many different congenital problems. For example, cocaine use during pregnancy can cause microcephaly (a smaller head size than usual) and problems with the way the fetus's urinary system and genitals grow.\nMedications.\nSome medications can also hurt the fetus if its mother takes them while she is pregnant. For example:p.\u00a023-6\nBefore the 1960s, many countries did not have rules about testing medications for their effects on fetuses. This changed partly because of thalidomide. This medication was given to pregnant women for nausea in the 1950s and 1960s. Between 1956 and 1962, more than 10,000 children in 46 different countries were born with birth defects, like arms and legs that had not grown. Thalidomide had not been tested well enough before it started being prescribed. Now, many countries require more testing before a medication can be said to be safe during pregnancy.\nInfections.\nIf a woman gets an infection while she is pregnant, sometimes the infection can affect her fetus. The placenta protects the fetus from many different viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens that cause infections. However, some pathogens can get through the placenta and infect the fetus. This is called vertical transmission. Some of these infections can cause birth defects.\nExamples of infections that can cause birth defects include:\nChemicals.\nSome chemicals can cause birth defects, if a pregnant woman is exposed to enough of them.

They are often found just above the source of a river, making a sort of \"bridge\" over to the headwaters of another river. Passes may be very short, with steep slopes to the top of the pass, or valleys of many kilometers.\nRoads and railways have been built through passes. Some high and rugged passes may have tunnels dug underneath to let traffic move faster.\nThe top of a pass is often the only flat ground in the area so it is often a good site for buildings. For countries whose borders lie on a mountain range, the pass is often part of the border. As well as making travel easy between valleys, passes also provide a route between two mountain tops so it is common for tracks to meet at a pass; this often makes them good routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor.\nSome of the best known passes are Great St. Bernard Pass at in the Alps, the Khyber Pass at between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the Khardong La Pass at in Jammu and Kashmir, India.

Blast furnaces are very large. They can be up to tall and in diameter. The blast furnace is the biggest chemical reactor. Blast furnaces are also called high ovens.\nA blast furnace is usually built with a steel case and bricks made of magnesium oxide or other refractory material inside the case. The hot furnace cannot melt these bricks. The furnace is cooled with water running inside part of the case and bricks.\nThe process of making iron is simple. Iron ore is basically iron oxide. Iron is made by removing the oxygen. This leaves crude iron called \"pig iron\". This process of removing oxygen is called smelting. Carbon is used in the reduction process, with the ore heated to a high temperature. Carbon easily takes the oxygen off the ore in high temperatures.\nProcess.\nOre, limestone and carbon in the form of coke are put into the top of the blast furnace in layers. At the same time, hot air called \"wind\" is blown inside the furnace. Special nozzles called \"tuyeres\" are used to put the air in the furnace. The nozzles are at the bottom of the furnace. This process is called \"blasting\". It is why it is called a \"blast furnace\". The coke ignites (lights on fire) and burns. This creates carbon monoxide because there is not enough oxygen to make carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide then reduces the metal oxide to the metal and makes carbon dioxide. This process is used to make iron. The limestone forms a substance called slag with the rock of the iron ore.\nThe bottom part of the furnace is called the \"hearth\". When it has filled with liquid pig iron and slag, the slag is removed. This is called \"skimming\". Slag is lighter than iron and does not mix with iron. It floats on top of the iron. A hole is made in the hearth at the level of the slag with a special drill. The liquid slag moves out through the hole into a container called \"slag pot\". The iron is then drained from the hearth. This is called \"tapping\". A hole is made at the bottom and the liquid pig iron comes out. It is either used directly for steelmaking, put into a special railway wagon called \"torpedo car\" or made into molds. When all the pig iron has been removed, fire-resistant clay is used to close the two holes. The clay becomes solid very quickly because of the high heat. \nThe pig iron contains some 4% of carbon and it would be too hard and too brittle to use. The extra carbon must first be burned away. The pig iron is refined into steel by decarburizing (burning the extra carbon off of) it. A modern method for decarburizing the pig iron and refining it into steel is basic oxygen furnace. Historically there has been other methods as well, such as Bessemer converter, open hearth furnace and puddling furnace.\nThe gases rise up and are collected on the top of the furnace. As the gas contains a lot of carbon monoxide, it is a valuable fuel. The gas collected on the top of the blast furnace is called \"blast furnace gas\". It is then washed and dried and all solid particles such as soot or ore dust are collected. The gas is then burned in special ovens called \"Cowper stoves\" or \"hot blast stoves\" into carbon dioxide. The heat from burning the blast furnace gas is then used to pre-heat the blasting air, \"wind\", which in turn is blasted into the blast furnace itself.\nThe slag is not waste. It can be used in various ways. It can be made into bricks and used for construction, or it can be mixed with concrete. Concrete which contains blast furnace slag is stronger than ordinary concrete and is almost pure white, where normal concrete is dirty grey.\nA blast furnace can usually work for 10 to 20 years without stopping. This is called a \"campaign.\"\nChemical example.\nAt the temperature of 900-1600\u00b0C, a reduction with carbon occurs:\nNow iron has been made."}

It hit the Texas shore in the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season as a Category\u00a04 hurricane, becoming one of the most powerful storms to ever strike the United States. Hurricane Carla was the second strongest storm to ever hit the Texas shore. The storm caused over $2\u00a0billion (2005 US dollars) in damages, but because over 500,000 people who lived there moved out only 43 were killed.\nMeteorological history.\nA tropical depression started in the western Caribbean Sea on September 3 from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. It moved northwestward, to become Tropical Storm Carla on the 5th and \"Hurricane\" Carla on the 6th. After touching the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula as a weak hurricane, Carla moved into the Gulf of Mexico and headed for the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nAs it moved slowly across the Gulf of Mexico, Carla got stronger to its peak of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h) winds (Category\u00a05 intensity) on September 11. Just before landfall, it weakened, but Carla was still a very strong and unusually large Category 4 hurricane when it touched the shore between Port O'Connor and Port Lavaca, Texas, on the 11th. At the time, Carla became the largest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. Along the whole Texas shore, hurricane warnings were given, and people were moved out of their homes in low-lying areas.\nImpact.\nStorm surge was measured at 22\u00a0feet (6.6 m) near the heads of bays, in some places reaching 10\u00a0miles inland. Because of its large size, the whole Texas shore was hit, and damage was seen as far away as Dallas. Winds were reported to be 115\u00a0mph in Matagorda, 110\u00a0mph in Victoria and 88\u00a0mph in Galveston. Wind gusts as high as 170\u00a0mph were recorded at Port Lavaca. Pressure at landfall was measured at 931 mb (hPa), making it the eighth most intense hurricane to strike the United States in the 20th century. Then little-known newsman Dan Rather reported live from the Galveston Seawall during the storm, an act that would be imitated by later reporters. This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane.\nMuch of the damage was done well away from the landfall site, as Carla caused one of the largest hurricane-related tornado outbreaks on record at the time, when 26 tornadoes touched down within its circulation. One F4 tornado ripped through downtown Galveston, killing several (sources differ on the exact number, varying from 6 to 12). Outside the protection of the Galveston Seawall, structures on the island were severely damaged by storm surge. Damage was reported as far east as the Mississippi River delta.\nAs Carla weakened, it dropped heavy rain in the Midwest, causing some flooding.\nCarla killed 43 people, 31 of them in Texas. The low number of deaths was due to what was then the largest movement of people out of their homes in US history except during a war. One half million people moved inland from exposed coastal areas.

The capital is the city of Matsue. It has the second smallest population of any prefecture in Japan.\nShimane Prefecture is part of the San'in area. San'in means \"the shady side of the mountains\". There is a mountain range separating Shimane and neighboring Tottori from Hiroshima and Okayama. That means that the weather here is much wetter than further to the south.\nHistory.\nThe area of Shimane Prefecture includes the old provinces of Iwami Province, Izumo Province, and Oki Province. \nEarly history.\nThe history of Shimane starts with Japanese mythology. In these myths, the Shinto god \u014ckuninushi lived in Izumo, an old province in Shimane. Izumo Shrine honors this god. \nLater on in the Kamakura period, the Kamakura Shogunate forced Emperor Gotoba and Emperor Godaigo into exile on Oki Island. Emperor Godaigo got away from Oki and successfully fought back against the shogunate.\nMiddle Ages.\nDuring the Muromachi period, many clans fought over this area because there was a lot of silver. The Kyogoku clan controlled Izumo and Oki. However, after the \u014cnin War, the Amago clan in Gassan-Toda castle increased in power, and the Masuda clan controlled Iwami. Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine was in between Amago clan territory and Masuda clan territory, so there were many battles between these lords for the large amount of silver. However, in 1566 Mouri Motonari (\u6bdb\u5229\u5143\u5c31) conquered Izumo, Iwami, and Oki. After over 30 years of Mori control, in 1600 Horio Yoshiharu entered Izumo and Oki after the Battle of Sekigahara which Mouri lost. Horio Yoshiharu decided to move and build Matsue Castle instead of Gassan-Toda. The castle was completed soon after Yoshiharu's death. Later in 1638, the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Matsudaira Naomasa entered the castle because the Horio clan had no heir. Matsudaira's family ruled until the end of the han system. \nThe Iwami area was split into 3 clans. The mining district was under direct control of the Shogunate. The Hamada clan and the Tsuwano clan each controlled their own areas. Iwami Ginzan produced silver and was one of the nation's largest silver mine by the early 17th century. The Hamada clan was on the shogunate's side in the Meiji Restoration, and the castle was burned down. The Tsuwano clan, despite the Matsudaira (relative of the shogun) rule was on the emperor's side in the restoration.\nGeography.\nShimane faces the Sea of Japan on its north. Its southeastern border meets Tottori Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture and Yamaguchi Prefecture.\nNational Parks.\nNational Parks are established in about 6% of the total land area of the prefecture.\nShrines and Temples.\n\"Izumo taisha\", \"Mononobe jinja\", \"Mizuwakasu jinja\" and \"Yurahime jinja\" are the chief Shinto shrines (\"ichinomiya\") in the prefecture."}

It allows people to create games and play games created by other people. It was created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006. The platform has many different types of games. \"Roblox\" began to grow fast in 2021. Roblox can be used on iOS and many systems, as it cannot be played on a browser. For example, if you try to play a game on a web browser, a message will come up telling you to open the game in the app.\n\"Roblox\" is free, but accounts can buy a currency called \"Robux\u201d. As of August 2020, \"Roblox\" has over 164 million monthly active players.\nRoblox has 43.2 million daily active users worldwide. An increase from 19.1 million daily active users by the end of 2019.\nHistory.\n2006-2009.\nRoblox had a big change in 2006. In January 2006, Roblox removed their special points and made multiplayer, but the API was never used until March 2006. In February 2006, Roblox left beta and was made free for all players. In September 2006, Roblox made changes to the multiplayer API so that players could make their own multiplayer games for free instead of the Roblox developers making them. \nIn May 2007, the Roblox developers began making virtual items, and its first virtual item was a top hat. Roblox also started the Builders Club which is a paid membership.\nGuest mode, which is for players that want to play Roblox without making an account, was introduced in 2008. Later, higher forms of the Builders Club (known as the Turbo Builders Club and the Outrageous Builders Club) were started in 2009.\n2010.\nIn 2010, Roblox Studio was changed so that game developers could understand its features easily.\nand new roblox hats got released\n2011.\nIn 2011, Roblox released its first commercial. The commercial had the well known quote, \"IT'S FREE.\"\n2012.\nOn 1 April 2012, Roblox was hacked. It caused the Roblox website to be shut down that day. On 2 April 2012, the website was recovered.\n2013.\nIn 2013, Roblox added dynamic lighting. Its purpose was to make more realistic lighting. This update would eventually receive more updates in the coming years.\n2015-2016.\nIn June 2015, Roblox released Smooth Terrain which made the terrain (such as sand, grass, water, etc.) more realistic. \nOn 14 April 2016, Tix was removed.\n2017.\nIn January 2017, Roblox changed their logo. The game's YouTube channel also released a music video to showcase it.\nIn October 2017, Roblox removed Guest Mode.\n2019.\nIn 2019, Builders Club was replaced with Roblox Premium.\n2020.\nIn December 2020, Roblox announced that players would soon no longer need Premium to upload clothing, but instead, pay a fee for 10 Robux per upload. The change was added in March 2021.\n2021.\nIn May 2021, an anonymous user filed a class action lawsuit against the Roblox Corporation for supposedly scamming players for not giving out refunds when banned items get deleted.\nIn June 2021, a group of music publishers sued the Roblox company for mass copyright infringement (using many copyrighted songs without being allowed to), with the publishers seeking 200 million US dollars from them.\nIn August 2021, Roblox bought the development team of a communication app known as Guilded for 90 million USD. In the same month, they chose some developers to test out voice chatting features.\nGames and game passes.\nRoblox lets its players create their own games using its app called Roblox Studio. Players on Roblox can build anything they want to using the Studio and then publish their game to the Roblox website for everyone to play. If the player knows how to code they can use scripts to change the game.\nIn some games, the creator may create game passes that will cost any amount of Robux to buy. These passes usually give benefits. \nVirtual items and currency.\nPlayers on Roblox can buy virtual items from the Catalog using virtual currency. This currency is obtained by selling items on Roblox or logging in daily if a player has Builders Club. There is only one currency as of 2016, Robux (R$), which can only be owned by purchasing Roblox Premium membership, selling gamepasses or clothing, buying a Robux card from a shop, or using a credit card or PayPal on the Roblox website. Robux is used to buy items such as Gear (tools to use in the game, like weapons) and Hats. On the Character page, players can change their clothing and customize their character how they want to. Any virtual items that a player buys from the catalog can be seen on the page. Roblox sometimes gives away free items during special events (for example, reaching 1 million followers on Twitter.\nAnother form of currency that was discontinued was the Tix (Tickets). All players could get a few Tix each day they log into Roblox, and trade those Tix in to get Robux. Tix were removed from the game in March 2016. \nMembership.\nBuilders Club was Roblox's first membership club which could only be used through a purchase. Builders Club gave its members more features in Roblox, such as earning its virtual currency called Robux, and the ability to trade items. Another thing players could do was sell Limited items (buy-able and sell-able items on the Avatar Shop). There were three types of Builders Club: Classic, Turbo, and Outrageous. Classic was the original Builders Club type and Outrageous was the newest. Players would either buy it monthly or annually. \nIn 2019, Builder's Club was removed and replaced with Premium. Premium is very much like the original Builders Club except it gives players Robux every month instead of every day. Premium players also get access to perks in select games."}

He has written about war across the galaxy, artificial universes, consciousness, and evolution.\nBiography.\nBear was born in San Diego, California. From 1968 to 1973 he attended San Diego State University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1975, he married Christina M. Nielson, but they divorced in 1981. He remarried in 1983, to Astrid Anderson, the daughter of science fiction author Poul Anderson. They have two children, Erik and Alexandra. They live outside of Seattle, Washington.\nCareer.\nBear is often called a hard science fiction author because he uses many scientific details in his work.\nBear often answers major questions in contemporary science and culture with fictional solutions. For example, \"The Forge of God\" tries to explain the Fermi paradox. If the galaxy is filled with intelligences that could be very dangerous, young civilizations could only survive by staying quiet so nobody would notice them and attack. In \"Queen of Angels\" Bear examines crime, guilt and punishment in society. He does this by examining consciousness and awareness. Part of the novel is about highly-advanced computers that begging to become intelligent and aware of themselves as they communicate with humans. In the two books \"Darwin's Radio\" and \"Darwin's Children\" he writes about the problem of overpopulation with a mutation the human genome making, basically a new series of humans. The books bring up the question of cultural acceptance of something brand new that cannot be stopped.\nOne of Bear's favorite themes is how observers effect or create reality. In \"Blood Music\" reality becomes unstable as the number of observers\u2013trillions of intelligent single-cell organisms\u2013gets higher and higher. Both \"Anvil of Stars\"\u2013a sequel to \"The Forge of God\"\u2013and \"Moving Mars\" propose a physics based on information exchange between particles, capable of being altered at the \"bit level.\" (Bear has credited the inspiration for this idea to Frederick Kantor's 1967 treatise, \"Information Mechanics.\") In \"Moving Mars\" this knowledge is used to remove Mars from the solar system and transfer it to an orbit around a distant star.\n\"Blood Music\" (first published as a short story in 1983, and expanded to a novel in 1985) has also been credited as being the first account of nanotechnology in science fiction. The short story described microscopic medical machines. He described DNA as a computer system that could be changed. In \"Queen of Angels\" and \"Slant\", Bear gives a detailed description of a near-future nanotechnological society. This historical sequence continues with \"Heads\"\u2013which may contain the first description of a \"quantum logic computer\"\u2013and with \"Moving Mars\". These books also show the historical development of self-awareness in AIs. One AI character called Jill is in all of these books. Bear was influenced by Robert A. Heinlein's self-aware computer Mycroft Holmes (\"High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor\") in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" when creating Jill.\nMore recent works, such as the two novels Darwin's Radio and Darwin's Children stick closely to the known facts of molecular biology of viruses and evolution. These books are about the impact of a strange disease that appears to make evolutionary transitions happen. Bear includes some very speculative ideas, but he wrote about them so carefully that \"Darwin's Radio\" gained praise in the science journal \"Nature\".\nBear, Gregory Benford, and David Brin wrote a series of three novels that take place before Isaac Asimov's famous \"Foundation\" series. Bear is named as the author of the second of the three books.\nWhile most of Bear's writing is science fiction, he also wrote in other genres. Two of his early works, \"The Infinity Concerto\" and \"The Serpent Mage\"are clearly fantasies. These are now published together as one novel called \"Songs of Earth and Power\". \"Psychlone\" is horror. Bear called his story \"Dead Lines\" a \"high-tech ghost story.\" He has received many accolades, including five Nebula awards and two Hugo awards for science fiction."}

It is the only species in its genus.\nDescription.\nThe serval has the longest legs of all cats, relative to its size. Not only can it run fast, but it is an amazing jumper: two to three metres from a standing start.\nIts length as an adult is about 32 inches (body) and 16 inches (tail). It weighs about four pounds. There are a number of subspecies, and its geographical range is from the Cape of South Africa to Algeria, wherever the circumstances are right for it.\nIt is lightly built, with very large ears and long legs. The back of the ears is black with a big white spot, and the tip of the tail is black. These signs serve as signals to other servals, including kittens.\nHabitat.\nThe serval needs access to water, and dense grassland. Reed beds, scrub or high grass are typical habitats. It is territorial.\nHunting and diet.\nThe serval is nocturnal, and hunts mostly at night. The serval is an opportunistic predator whose diet includes rodents, hares, hyraxes, birds, reptiles, insects, fish, and frogs.\nAs part of its adaptations for hunting in the savannas, the serval's long legs help it achieve a top speed of 80 kilometres per hour (50\u00a0mph), and has large ears with acute hearing. Its long legs and neck allow the serval to see over tall grasses, while its ears are used to detect prey, even those burrowing underground. Servals have been known to dig into burrows in search of underground prey, and to leap 2 to 3 metres (7 to 10\u00a0ft) into the air to grab birds in flight. Using its spectacular jumping ability, the serval leaps into the air and bats the bird with its front paws. When the bird is on the ground, it bites its neck, killing it.\nLike most cats, the serval is a solitary animal. It travels as much as each night in search of food. The female defends home ranges of , depending on local prey availability. The male defends larger territories of , and marks its territory by spraying urine onto bushes."}

Even though it is written like this, no matter how many nines there are before the ellipsis, it is still equal in value to 1.\nAbout.\n0.999... is a repeating decimal, which means the digit \"9\" is repeated forever. It is different from 0.999, which only has three 9s.\n0.999... can also be written as\nformula_1,\nformula_2 or\nformula_3.\nIt is hard for many people to understand why 0.999... is the same as 1. There are many proofs that show why they are the same number, but many of these proofs are very complex.\nExamples.\nOne simple way of showing that 0.999... and 1 are the same thing is to divide them both by the number 3. When 0.999... is divided by 3, the answer is 0.333..., which is the same as (the fraction one third).\nWhen 1 is divided by 3, the answer is . Since the answers are the same, that means that 0.999... and 1 are the same. Another way of thinking about it is if = 0.333... and = 0.666..., then = 0.999... therefore, as = 1, 0.999... must also equal 1. There are many other ways of showing this.\nAnother way of proving that 0.999... = 1 is by accepting the simple fact that if two numbers are different, there must be at least one number between them. For example, a number between 1 and 2 is 1.5, and a number between 0.9 and 1 is 0.95. Since 0.999... has an infinite number of 9s, there cannot be another number after the \"last\" 9, meaning there is no number between 0.999... and 1. Therefore, they are equal.\nOne more common proof is such:\nformula_5\nformula_6\nformula_7\nformula_8\nformula_9\nformula_10\nIn popular culture.\nAs the Internet developed, arguments about 0.999... are often on newsgroups and message boards. Even newsgroups and message boards that do not have much to do with math argue about this. In the newsgroup sci.math, arguing about 0.999... is a \"popular sport\".

Its name means \"high-spined lizard\". This refers to the spines on its vertebrae which formed a sail or hump when the animal was alive.\nIts classification is uncertain. It was originally classified as a spinosaur, because the spines on its back looked like those of \"Spinosaurus\". However, \"Acrocanthosaurus\" is now classified as a carnosaur. Most paleontologists believe that it was a carcharodontosaurid.\n\"Acrocanthosaurus\" was 39 feet long, almost as large as \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", and weighed about 6 or 7 short tons. It was the largest theropod in North America before the evolution of the tyrannosaurs.\nLong, low ridges start at the nasal bones. They run along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, and they continued onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosaurids.\nThere is a famous trackway in Paluxy, Texas, which shows tracks of what might be an \"Acrocanthosaurus\" and its prey. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and there are other explanations.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Acrocanthosaurus\" was featured in an episode of the television documentary \"Monsters Resurrected\". It was depicted as the top predator in early Cretaceous North America. A juvenile was scared away from its kill by a pack of \"Deinonychus\", and was forced to hunt more difficult prey, such as a \"Sauropelta\"."}
{"id": "267843", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=267843", "title": "Flood basalt", "text": "A flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava.\nFlood basalts have covered areas as large as a continent in prehistory, creating great plateaus and mountain ranges. Flood basalts have erupted at various times throughout Earth history. They are clear evidence that the Earth has periods of higher activity rather than being in a uniform steady state.\nOne explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated melting. Then a mantle plume produces vast quantities of a basaltic magma. These have a low viscosity, which is why they 'flood' rather than form taller volcanoes.\nFlood basalts start at between 100 and 400\u00a0km depth, in the asthenosphere. To get a partial melting as large as that of the traps, expelling huge quantities of lava, it is necessary to have a large heat input. Such melting can take place near a hotspot, resulting in a mixture of magma from the depths of the hotspot with superficial magma produced by a mantle plume.\nLava plateaux.\nA lava plateau is a flat, wide surface (plateau) that is formed when lava comes out of the ground and spreads out very quickly. The layers of lava can build up over time to form a lava plateau. Here are the general properties of lava plateaux:\nExamples.\nThe Emeishan Traps in southwestern China, around Sichuan province, the Deccan Traps of central India, the Siberian Traps, and the Columbia River Plateau of western North America are four large regions covered by prehistoric flood basalts. The two largest flood basalt events in historic time have been at Eldgj\u00e1 and Lakagigar, both in Iceland. The largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain on Earth is part of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in Canada. The maria on the Moon are additional, even more extensive, flood basalts. Flood basalts on the ocean floor produce oceanic plateaus.\nThe surface covered by one eruption can vary from around 200,000\u00a0km\u00b2 (Karoo) to 1,500,000\u00a0km\u00b2 (Siberian Traps). The thickness can vary from 2000 metres (Deccan Traps) to 12,000 m (Lake Superior). These are smaller than the original volumes due to erosion.\nAnother example of a lava plateau is the Giant's Causeway, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This is was originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateau."}

They continued for a million years and spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary, about 251 to 250\u00a0million years ago. It was the same time as the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, which is estimated to have killed 90% of species existing at the time. The eruption of the Siberian Traps is a possible cause of this \"Great Dying\".\nThe term \"traps\" is derived from the Swedish word for stairs (\"trappa\", or sometimes \"trapp\"), referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region, which is typical of flood basalts.\nGeographical extent.\nVast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large expanse of primaeval Siberia in a flood basalt event. Today the area covered is about 2\u00a0million km\u00b2 \u2013 roughly equal to western Europe in land area \u2013 and estimates of the original coverage are as high as 7\u00a0million km\u00b2. The original volume of lava is estimated to range from 1 to 4\u00a0million km\u00b3.\nOrigin.\nThe source of the Siberian Traps basalt was, probably, a mantle plume at the base of the crust which erupted through the Siberian craton (the oldest part of the Siberian continental plate). Helium isotope analysis from the basalts indicates a plume origin. The scientific debate continues. There is a minority controversial theory which argues that the traps were caused by a large asteroid impact.\nThe Great Dying.\nThis massive eruptive event spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary, about 250 million years ago, and is widely cited as a cause of the Permian-Triassic extinction event. This extinction event, also called the Great Dying, affected all life on Earth, and is estimated to have killed 90% of species living at the time. Life on land took 30 million years to recover from the environmental disruptions caused by the eruption of the Siberian Traps.\nSiberian Traps and nickel.\nThe Siberian Traps are considered to have erupted through numerous vents over a period of a million years or more, probably east and south of Norilsk in Siberia. The giant Norilsk nickel-copper-palladium deposit formed within the magma flows in the main Siberian Traps. The presence of extensive tuff and pyroclastic deposits suggests that a number of large explosive eruptions occurred during or before the eruptions of basaltic lavas. The presence of silicic volcanic rocks such as rhyolite is also indicative of explosive eruptions."}

This is contrasted to analogous traits: similarities between organisms that were evolved separately. \nThe term existed before 1859, but got its modern meaning after Darwin established the idea of common descent.p45\nThe pre-Darwinian naturalists Cuvier, Geoffroy and Richard Owen, also used the idea.\nA homologous trait is often called a homologue (also spelled homolog). In genetics, the term \"homologue\" is used both to refer to a homologous protein, and to the gene (DNA sequence) encoding it.\nHomology vs analogy.\nAccording to Russell, we owe to Richard Owen the first clear distinction between homologous and analogous organs. Owen's definitions were:\nThe distinction is made clear by examples such as the ear ossicles of mammals. These little bones have, in the course of several hundred million years of evolution, made their way from the gill covers of fish to the rear jaw bones of Synapsids to their present position in the ear of mammals. In the fossil record is evidence of this, and also in embryology. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, tiny bone structures break loose from the jaw and migrate to the inner ear area. The ear ossicles are homologous with the jaw bones and the gill covers, but not analogous.\nThis rather extraordinary story was first proposed in 1818 by \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, who looked at fish and tried to discover the homologies of their bones with that of land vertebrates.\nLevel of analysis.\n\"A trait may be both homologous and analogous\", depending on the level at which the trait is examined. For example, the wings of birds and bats are homologous as \"forearms\" in tetrapods. However, they are not homologous as \"wings\", because the organ served as a forearm (not a wing) in the last common ancestor of tetrapods. \nBy definition, any homologous trait defines a clade\u2013a monophyletic taxon in which all the members have the trait (or have lost it secondarily); and all non-members lack it.\nRelated terms.\nGene sequences.\nConserved sequences of DNA, RNA and proteins can be used to decide homologies between organisms.\nDeep homology.\nIn evolutionary developmental biology, the concept of deep homology is used to describe cases where growth and differentiation are controlled by genetic mechanisms that are homologous and deeply conserved across a wide range of species. Textbook examples common to metazoa include the homeotic genes that control differentiation along the body, and pax genes (especially PAX6) involved in the development of the eye and other sensory organs.\nAn algorithm identifies deeply homologous genetic modules in unicellular organisms, plants, and non-human animals based on phenotypes (such as traits and developmental defects). The technique aligns phenotypes across organisms based on the homology of genes involved in the phenotypes."}

In the Pacific Northwest, the \"Quetzalcoatlus\" can see the impact.\nMeanwhile, Mongolia is 8,000 miles away from the point of impact. A herd of \"Charonosaurus\" is drinking at a watering hole. They are protecting their eggs. Suddenly, a \"Troodon\" appears. Its brain-to-body weight ratio is among the highest of any dinosaur. It steals an egg, but is seen by the mother. It runs into a cave. A second \"Saurornithoides\" is in the cave. The two predators start chasing the \"Charonosaurus\". They jump on its neck and slash with their retractable toe claws, killing their prey. Then they start feasting on the carcass.\nMillions of tons of dust and rock were thrown up into the air by the asteroid's impact. This is the ejecta cloud. In Mongolia, the ejecta cloud causes the temperature to become hotter. As the air temperature reaches 120 degrees, the \"Troodons\" run inside the cave. The temperature ticks upward every second. The \"Charonosaurus\" go into the cave. Inside the cave, it is cooler. However, the \"Charonosaurus\" and \"Troodon\" are forced to share the cave with each other, even though they are enemies.\nBack in the Pacific Northwest, fires burn across the forest floor at 9 miles per hour. The \"Tyrannosaurus\" and the \"Triceratops\" are running to get away from the fire. The panicked animals race up the valley slopes. \nIn Mongolia, the temperatures are finally starting to decrease. The \"Troodon\" run outside and start feeding on a \"Charonosaurus\" corpse. Soon, the \"Charonosaurus\" follow. However, one stays near the protection of the cave. However, the dinosaurs are not safe yet. The ejecta cloud has caused a huge sandstorm. As it hits, the \"Troodons\" are small enough to crouch for cover. But the \"Charonosaurus\" are out in the open. The harder they struggle and the deeper they gasp for oxygen, the more sand fills their lungs, until finally, they can't breathe. It's hours before the winds die down. The last \"Charonosaurus\", protected once again by the cave, finds that it's the last of the herd. But it's not the last remaining dinosaur in the neighborhood. The \"Troodons\" were sheltered from the worst of the storm. They have survived.\nInstinct drives the \"Troodon\" back to their prime hunting spot, the watering hole, where the last remaining \"Charonosaurus\" is drinking. The \"Troodon\" are desperate for food. One of them has the confidence to attack. The \"Troodon\" runs to the\"Charonosaurus\" and leaps on it. It starts slashing at its neck. The \"Charonosaurus\" is still too exhausted to run. Suddenly, the \"Charonosaurus\" crashes to the ground, crushing the \"Troodon\" to death under its weight. The remaining \"Troodon\" starts eating the dead body of its companion.\nA week after impact, food is in very short supply across the entire planet. In the Pacific Northwest, two \"Triceratops\" are searching for food. Their hunger drives them to the Pacific coast. They see an island. Protected from the fires by the surrounding ocean, the island is lush and green. It has all the food that the \"Triceratops\" need. But when the asteroid hit the Earth, it caused an earthquake under the ocean. This causes a huge tsunami. The ocean is dragged back hundreds of feet. The path to the island is suddenly dry land. The \"Triceratops\" walk across the land bridge to the island. However, the tsunami crashes down on them, flooding the land. The \"Triceratops\" drown.\nIn the days and weeks that follow, few dinosaurs remain. In Mongolia, the starving \"Charonosaurus\" stays close to the cave that has saved it twice in the past. Suddenly, it collapses, but not from starvation. Bubbling to the surface from hot springs is one of nature's most toxic gases; Hydrogen Sulfide. The \"Troodon\" runs up to the dead \"Charonosaurus\". Then it too dies from inhaling the poisonous gas.\nIn the Pacific Northwest, only a handful of dinosaurs patrol the gray wasteland. An \"Ankylosaurus\", severely weakened by hunger, is searching for food. All it can find is a small bush. But even that won't come without a fight. A \"Triceratops\" roars at the \"Ankylosaurus\". Suddenly, a \"T. rex\" appears. It roars at the herbivores. Then it kills the \"Triceratops\". The \"Ankylosaurus\" tries to defend itself with its heavy tail club, but it's too weak to fight. The \"Tyrannosaurus\" flips the \"Ankylosaurus\" over and bites its soft underbelly, killing it. Then the \"Tyrannosaurus\" collapses from hunger. It falls on the \"Triceratops\"' horn and is impaled by it after tripping over the Ankylosaurus. \nIn Mexico, the first region to be hit by the asteroid, life still remains. Buried in the cool ground inside its egg, an \"Alamosaurus\" baby has survived. And so has an adult \"Alamosaurus\". All around the world, small handfuls of dinosaurs try to start over. But their species are already considered extinct. In order to survive, any species needs to maintain a critical mass of population. If it falls below that threshold, then there's no way to climb back from certain extinction.\nBut life on Earth is not completely destroyed. Out of the ruins, nature starts over. A group of animals that have long been limited in success by the dinosaurs now become the new rulers of the Earth: mammals. Eventually, they multiply and diversify. 10,000 species explode across the planet. And one species, humans, branches off from its relatives and comes down from the trees. They walk on two legs, evolve bigger brains, and eventually, they rule the planet. They build cities that touch the sky, vehicles that can leave the planet, and weapons that can destroy it.\nIn the end, the narrator says that humans would never have existed if a chance collision in space 150 million years ago had not occurred, sending an asteroid hurtling towards Earth and dooming the dinosaurs to extinction."}

Its remains were found in China. \nThe partial skull resembles that of \"Parasaurolophus\" from North America. This does \"not\" suggest a Bering land bridge existed during the Cretaceous period, since at that time North America was far away from Eastern Asia. Instead, it is likely that this group of hadrosaurs all had a similar long, backward-projecting hollow crest. It may have been used for trumpeting their calls. In other words, their skull shape was a basal feature.\n\"Charonosaurus\" was a very large lambeosaurine hadrosaur (estimated around 13\u00a0m (42.5\u00a0ft) long), known from a partial skull found in Heilongjiang Province, northeastern China. Adult and juvenile hadrosaur remains were found in the same area. They give information on the rest of the skeleton; the femur length was up to 1.35 m. (4.5\u00a0ft). \nIn popular culture.\n\"Charonosaurus\" was featured in the Discovery Channel television documentary The Last Day of the Dinosaurs, where it was the prey of \"Troodon\"."}
{"id": "268012", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268012", "title": "Dinosaur brains and intelligence", "text": "Dinosaur brains and intelligence are interesting topics. Dinosaurs were once regarded as stupid animals, but it is now realised that some of the smaller carnivores had above average intelligence for reptiles. This idea led to exaggerated portrayals in films like Jurassic Park.\n\"Stegosaurus\".\nThe idea that \"Stegosaurus\" had a \"brain the size of a walnut\" (an oft-repeated phrase), was not quite accurate. It had a brain the size of a dog's, but in proportion to its body, the brain was very small. In the 1880s a well-preserved \"Stegosaurus\" braincase allowed Othniel Charles Marsh to get a cast of the brain cavity, which gave an idea of the brain size. The endocast showed that the brain was indeed small: relative to body size, maybe the smallest among the dinosaurs. The fact that an animal weighing over 4.5\u00a0metric tonnes (5\u00a0short tons) could have a brain of no more than 80\u00a0grams (2.8\u00a0oz) led to the idea that dinosaurs were unintelligent, an idea now largely rejected.\nMarsh also noted a large canal in the hip region of the spinal cord, which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 times larger than the famously small brain. This may have been used to coordinate the hind region in defence against theropod attack. This function for the \"second brain\" is not proved by any direct evidence.\nBrain-body size relationship.\nBrain size usually increases with body size in animals (is positively correlated). That means large animals usually have larger brains than smaller animals. The relationship is not linear however. Generally, small mammals have relatively larger brains than big ones. Mice have a direct brain/body size ratio similar to humans (1/40), while elephants have comparatively small brain/body size (1/560), though elephants are obviously quite intelligent animals.\nEncephalization quotient (EQ).\nThe formula for the curve varies, but is usually given as Ew(brain) = 0.12w(body)2/3. As this formula is based on data from mammals, it should be applied to other animals with caution. For some of the other vertebrate classes the power of 3/4 rather than 2/3 is sometimes used, and for many groups of invertebrates the formula may give no meaningful results at all.\nIntelligence.\nIntelligence in animals is hard to establish, but the larger the brain is relative to the body, the more brain weight might be available for complex cognitive tasks. Rather than simply measuring raw brain weight, the EQ formula makes for a ranking of animals. The ranking coincides better with the observed complexity of behaviour. Mean EQ for mammals is around 1, with carnivorans, cetaceans and primates above 1, and insectivores and herbivores below. It also puts humans at the top of the list. The relationship between brain-to-body mass ratio and complexity of behaviour is not perfect, because other factors also influence intelligence. These factors include the evolution of the recent cerebral cortex and different degrees of brain folding. This increase the surface of the cortex, which is positively correlated to intelligence in humans.\nDinosaur brains.\nProblems with EQ.\nTraditional comparisons of brain volume to body mass in dinosaurs have estimated brain size as the volume of the endocast. However, the brain of the modern reptile genus \"Sphenodon\" fills only about half of its endocranial volume. Some paleontologists used this fifty percent estimate in their estimates of dinosaur brain volume. Other workers have observed that details on the endocranial surface indicates that some fossil reptiles had brains that occupied a much larger portion of the endocranium. Larsson notes that the transition from reptiles to birds prevents using a set ratio from being a valid approach to estimating the volume of the endocranium occupied by a dinosaur's brain.\nAdding difficulty is the wide range of estimates for live mass. One study estimated that the live masses for many dinosaur genera had a four-fold range. Larsson laments that \"[t]he broad ranges of body mass estimates, combined with the ambiguous ratio of endocranial volume occupied by the brain, present a high degree of uncertainty for [creating an] index of brain size\". Consequently, he attempted to minimize errors by making a different kind of comparison.\nWhile it is difficult to estimate the absolute volume of the brain, the proportions of its various regions of the brain should be the same in the endocast as it was in the live brain. Larsson's study compared the ratio of the cerebrum, which is clearly marked on the inside of skulls, to the rest of the endocast's volume. According to Larsson, his technique is superior to traditional comparisons of brain volume to estimated live body mass.\nTheropod brains.\nMost dinosaurs, and most theropods, had brains no better than present-day reptiles, so far as can be estimated. In a 2001 study of a \"Carcharodontosaurus saharicus\" endocast, Hans Larsson found that both \"C. saharicus\" and \"Allosaurus\" had a ratio of cerebrum to brain volume that was very similar to non-avian reptiles. By contrast, the \"Tyrannosaurus\" ratio was slightly in the direction of a more bird-like proportion. Since tyrannosaurs are relatively basal coelurosaurs, this is evidence that the advent of the Coelurosauria marks the beginning of a trend in theropod brain enlargement.\nTroodon.\n\"Troodon\"'s cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio was 31.5% to 63% of the way from a nonavian reptile proportion to a truly avian one.\nArchaeopteryx.\n\"Archaeopteryx\" had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% of the way to modern birds.\nSummary.\nThe method used for Larsson's comparison was not the EQ, but a ratio of the size of the cerebrum to the whole brain. The cerebrum is chiefly responsible for what might be called 'intelligent behaviour'.\nThe brains of dinosaurs were generally much like other reptiles in their proportions. The exception is the coelurosaurs, which had cerebra proportionately larger than most reptiles, but proportionately smaller than modern birds."}

His \"Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates\" (3 vols. London 1866\u20131868) was a standard reference work for many years.\nHis career was tainted by accusations that he failed to give credit to the work of others and even tried to appropriate it under his own name.\nControversies with his peers.\nOwen credited himself and Georges Cuvier with the discovery of the \"Iguanodon\", completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur, Gideon Mantell. This was not the first or last time Owen would deliberately claim a discovery as his own, when in fact it was not. Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society's Zoological Council for plagiarism.\nOwen was highly critical of Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\", in part because Darwin did not refer much to the previous scientific theories of evolution. Instead, Darwin compared the theory of evolution by natural selection with the unscientific theory in the Bible.\nOwen, in Darwin's opinion, was \"Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about\". \"It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me\".\nOwen was also a party to the threat to end government funding of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew botanical collection (see Joseph Dalton Hooker):\nIn the first part of his career Owen was regarded rightly as one of the great scientific figures of the age. In the second part of his career his reputation slipped. This was not solely due to his underhanded dealings with colleagues; it was also due to the serious errors of scientific judgement which were discovered and publicized. A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate sub-class of the Mammalia (see Thomas Henry Huxley). In this Owen had no supporters at all. Also, his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on.\nOwen continued working after his official retirement at the age of 79, but he never recovered the good opinions he had got in his younger days."}

The American Civil Liberties Union lawyers who represented al-Kidd claimed he was one of 70 Muslim men who were treated this way.\nAschroft claimed that he had \"absolute immunity\" from civil lawsuits like al-Kidd's. In other words, because his actions were part of his duties as Attorney General, nobody can sue him about those actions. Ashcroft also claimed that he had \"qualified immunity\" that prevents such lawsuits unless the official violated someone's constitutional rights.\nIn 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful holding of al-Kidd. On October 18, 2010, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear Ashcroft's appeal.\nSupreme Court decision.\nOn May 31, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled against al-Kidd by a vote of 8-0. (Usually there are nine Supreme Court Justices, but Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the al-Kidd case.)\nTo show that Ashcroft could be sued, al-Kidd's lawyers had to meet a very high burden of proof. They needed to prove that Ashcroft was directly involved in holding al-Kidd, or that he knew what was happening to al-Kidd. The Court ruled that al-Kidd's lawyers had not proved these things. They suggested that al-Kidd's detention was handled mostly by people who were much less powerful than Ashcroft.\nAll eight Supreme Court Justices agreed that the Ninth Circuit's ruling should be reversed. However, the Justices reached this decision for different reasons.\nMajority opinion.\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote a majority opinion. He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. Scalia wrote that a Magistrate Judge had issued a valid arrest warrant for al-Kidd based on specific information about him. Al-Kidd was not arrested in a general effort to sweep a large group of Muslims into jail he was specifically arrested because he was suspected.\nIn a footnote in his opinion, Scalia argues with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg about what type of \"individualized suspicion\" is needed to justify arresting a person. Scalia wrote that a person does not need to be suspected of \"wrongdoing\" he just needs to be suspected. Scalia found that Ashcroft was protected from any possible lawsuits for ordering this group of arrests:\nThe objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting authority had an improper motive.\nConcurring opinions.\nJustice Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion. He was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor for Part I of his opinion. He also wrote that al-Kidd's lawsuit should be dismissed.\nKennedy wrote the second part of his opinion alone. In this part, he described his concern that the Attorney General of the United States cannot be personally sued just because lower courts in some parts of the United States have made legal decisions opposing his policies.\nJustice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, wrote that it was \"uncertain\" just how powerful the Material Witness Statute was. For example, she/ questioned whether a \"law-abiding citizen\" who was not suspected of wrongdoing could be sent to jail if he saw \"a crime during the days or weeks before a scheduled flight abroad.\" Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor were also concerned about how al-Kidd was treated in jail. The Court did leave al-Kidd with the right to sue his jailers for mistreating him.\nJustice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, wrote that the Court did not have to think about Constitional questions to decide this case."}

{"id": "268228", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268228", "title": "Roman Wales", "text": "Roman Wales is the area of modern Wales that was under Roman Empire control.\nRoman Wales was an area of south western Britannia under Roman Empire control from the first to the fifth century AD. Romans considered it to be part of \"Roman Britain\". South east Wales was fully made Roman at the beginning of the fifth century.\nPre-Roman Wales.\nUp to and during the Roman occupation of Britain, the native inhabitants of Iron Age Britain spoke \"Brythonic\" languages (a sub-family of the Celtic languages) and were regarded as Britons (or Brythons). The area of modern Wales was divided among a number of tribes, of which the Silures in modern south-east Wales and the Ordovices in central and northwest Wales were the largest and most powerful. These two tribes were the ones who put up the strongest force to the Roman invasion: Mona (the island of Anglesey) was only conquered by Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 78 AD.\nRoman invasion of Wales.\nThe first attack on the Celtic tribes of what is now Wales was made under the legatus Publius Ostorius Scapula about 48 AD. Ostorius first attacked the Deceangli in the north-east, who appear to have surrendered with little resistance. He then spent several years campaigning against the Silures and the Ordovices. Their resistance was led by Caratacus, who had fled what is now southeast England when it was conquered by the Romans. He first led the Silures, then moved to the territory of the Ordovices, where he was defeated by Ostorius in 51 AD. Caratacus fled to the Brigantes, whose queen handed him over to the Romans.\nResistance.\nThe Silures waged effective warfare against the Roman forces. Ostorius died with this tribe still unconquered; after his death they won a victory over the Roman Second Augusta Legion, Legio II Augusta. There were no more attempts to extend Roman control in Wales until the governorship of Caius Suetonius Paulinus, who attacked further north and captured the island of Anglesey in 60 or 61 AD. However he was forced to stop the offensive to meet the threat from the rebellion of Boudica.\nThe Silures eventually came under Roman rule by Sextus Julius Frontinus in a series of campaigns ending about 78 AD. His successor Gnaeus Julius Agricola subdued the Ordovices and recaptured Anglesey by the beginning of 78 AD.\nOccupation and romanisation.\nThe Romans occupied the whole of the area now known as Wales, where they built Roman roads and Roman forts, mined gold at Luentinum and conducted commerce, but their interest in the area was limited because of the difficult geography and shortage of flat agricultural land. Most of the Roman remains in Wales are military in nature.\nThe area was controlled by Roman legionary bases at Deva Victrix (modern Chester) and Isca Augusta (Caerleon), two of the three such bases in Roman Britain, with roads linking these bases to Roman auxiliary forts such as Segontium (actual Caernarfon) and Moridunum (actual Carmarthen).\nRomans are only known to have founded one town in Wales, Venta Silurum (Caerwent) in Monmouthshire, although the fort at Moridunum (Carmarthen) was later superseded by a civilian settlement. The modern-day Wales is thought to have been part of the Roman province of \"Britannia Superior\", and later of the province of \"Britannia Secunda\", which also included part of what is now the West Country of England.\nThe later part of the third century witnessed a new concern: defending the coast from seaborne marauders from Hibernia (actual Ireland). The response was a Saxon Shore-style fort at Cardiff and refurbishment elsewhere.\nIt is not clear when the legionary garrison at Caerleon was finally withdrawn, possibly by the end of the third century, although it may have left a skeleton force there as late as the mid-fourth century.\nThe military dispositions in late fourth-century Wales at Cardiff, Caernarfon, Holyhead and Caerhun seem to have been concerned with continuing incursions by Irish bands.\nThe remaining recognisably military posts seem to have been abandoned c.AD 393 when soldiers were needed to counteract a rebellion in Gaul. There is some evidence that troops may have been left to guard the towns of Carmarthen and Caerwent into the fifth century.\nEnd of Roman Wales.\nWales was occupied by the Romans from the first century AD to the Roman withdrawal from Britain nearly four centuries later, leaving their province to develop into Sub-Roman Britain and the emergence of Wales in the Early Middle Ages.\nThe only city founded by the Romans in Wales is Caerwent, called Venta Silurum in 75 AD when was created, and the last place to be left by the Romans.\nThe town lacked substantial defences until the mid 4th century, when stone town walls were built. A small garrison may have been based in the town during that period. Large sections of the defensive walls are still in place, rising up to 5 metres (17\u00a0feet) in height in places.\nThe walls have been described as \"easily the most impressive town defence to survive from Roman Britain, and in its freedom from later rebuilding one of the most perfectly preserved in Northern Europe.\"\nIndeed, the Roman town remained occupied after the Roman troops left, until at least the end of the fifth century. Caerwent has been even called the possible Camelot of King Arthur, because it is located only ten miles from the Roman fort Isca Silurum (actually Caerleon), that Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote was the place of the Round Table.\nFurthermore, it appears that Christian worship was already established in the town in the fifth century, and it may have had a bishop. A monastery was founded by Saint Tatheus in the 6th century, and a Christian cemetery was also established around the site of the present church.\nThe name \"Venta\" gave its name to the emerging Kingdom of Gwent, and the town itself became known as \"Caer-went\" or \"Castra/Fort of Venta/Gwent\". Tradition holds that Caradog Freichfras of Gwent moved his court from Caerwent to Portskewett during the second half of the 6th century, finishing in this way the last romanised presence in Wales.\nFinally, Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke (that divided Wales from medieval England) the people to its west saw themselves as \"Roman\", citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century."}

However, the Communist government did not allow him to continue to study formally because of his bourgeois family background. \nIn the early 1950s, the young Havel entered a four-year apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory assistant. He took evening classes at the same time and completed secondary education in 1954. None of the colleges or universities with humanities programs would accept Havel for political reasons. So, he chose to study at the Faculty of Economics of Czech Technical University in Prague. He dropped out after two years. In 1964, Havel married Olga \u0160pl\u00edchalov\u00e1. His mother was against the marriage.\nPresidency.\nHavel was already leader of the Civic Forum, and on 29 December 1989, he became president. He left office after his second term as Czech president ended on 2 February 2003. Every member of the Federal Assembly voted to make him president. This was a surprising change because Havel had always said that he was not interested in politics. He and other dissidents had said that change should come from groups of people directly, not from the government.\nCzechoslovakia had free elections in 1990. Havel won and continued to be president. Havel wanted to keep the federation of the Czechs and the Slovaks together during the breakup of Czechoslovakia. He supported keeping the country together even though this was difficult and there was a lot of pressure. On 3 July 1992 the federal parliament did not elect Havel \u2014 the only candidate \u2014 because Slovak MPs did not support him. Havel resigned as president on 20 July after the Slovaks issued their Declaration of Independence. He stood for election as president of the new Czech Republic in 1993. He won and became president of this new, separate country.\nHavel was quite popular throughout his career. However, some of his actions caused controversy and criticism. One of his first acts as a president was to pardon many people. He wanted to reduce the number of people in overcrowded prisons and release people who had been put in prison during the Communist era even though they were innocent. He did not trust the decisions of a corrupt court of the previous government. He thought the courts had been unfair to most people in prison. Critics said that this amnesty caused more crime. In his memoir, \"To the Castle and Back\", Havel wrote that most of the people he released had less than a year left to stay in prison. Statistics about this are not clear.\nHavel said that the most important thing he did as president was breaking up the Warsaw Pact. Ending this group of countries was very complicated because the association was a deep part of how the countries worked. It took two years before the Soviet troops finally left Czechoslovakia completely.\nHavel was very important to changing NATO. He helped change it from an anti-Warsaw Pact alliance to a group that includes former-Warsaw Pact members. Havel spoke very strongly for expanding of the military alliance into Eastern Europe, including the Czech Republic.\nAwards.\nHe has received many awards, including:"}

Its remains were found in the western United States and Alberta, Canada.\nDescription.\n\"Dromaeosaurus albertensis\" was a small carnivore, the size of a wolf, about 2\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft) in length and 15\u00a0kg (40\u00a0lb) in weight. Its mouth was full of sharp teeth, and it had a large \"sickle claw\" on each foot. It lived during the Upper Cretaceous: some teeth which may belong to it have been found from the latest Cretaceous, 65.5 million years ago.\nAlthough only a few bones are known from the hind limb, they indicate that \"Dromaeosaurus\" was a powerfully built animal. The presence of feathers in closely related animals makes it extremely likely that it was feathered as well.\n\"Dromaeosaurus\" had large eyes and excellent vision. It also probably had a good sense of smell and hearing. Its neck was curved and flexible and its jaws were solidly built. The tail was flexible at the base but sheathed in a lattice of bony rods; this allowed it to be carried in an upturned position.\nDiscovery and later findings.\nDespite widespread attention in popular books about dinosaurs, and complete mounted skeleton casts in many museums, \"Dromaeosaurus\" is surprisingly poorly known from actual fossils. The popular cast by the Tyrrell Museum was only made possible by knowledge gained from other dromaeosaurs discovered more recently.\nThe first known \"Dromaeosaurus\" remains were discovered by paleontologist Barnum Brown during a 1914 expedition to Red Deer River on behalf of the American Museum of Natural History.\nSeveral species of \"Dromaeosaurus\" have been described, but \"Dromaeosaurus albertensis\" is the most complete specimen. The genus is even rarer than other small theropods, although it was one of the first small theropods described.\nMatthew and Brown originally placed \"Dromaeosaurus\" within \"Deinodontidae\" (now known as Tyrannosauridae), based on some similarities in the general proportions of the skull. In 1969, John Ostrom recognized that \"Dromaeosaurus\" shared many features with \"Velociraptor\" and the newly-discovered \"Deinonychus\", and assigned these forms to a new family: Dromaeosauridae.\nPalaeobiology and diet.\n\"Dromaeosaurus\" differs from most of its relatives in having a short, massive skull, a deep mandible, and robust teeth. The teeth tend to be more heavily-worn than those of its relative \"Saurornitholestes\", suggesting that its jaws were used for crushing and tearing rather than simply slicing through flesh. \"Dromaeosaurus\" had a bite nearly three times as powerful as that of a \"Velociraptor\".\nIt is possible that, unlike most other dromaeosaurs, \"Dromaeosaurus\" relied more on its jaws than its claws to dispatch its prey. It was probably better suited to tackling large prey than the more lightly-built \"Saurornitholestes\".\nRelationships.\nThe relationships of \"Dromaeosaurus\" are unclear. Although its rugged build gives it a primitive appearance, it was actually a very specialized animal. It is usually given its own subfamily, the Dromaeosaurinae; this group is thought to include \"Utahraptor\", \"Achillobator\", \"Adasaurus\", and possibly \"Deinonychus\". However, the relationships of dromaeosaurs are still in a state of flux.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Dromaeosaurus\" are featured in \"Walking with Dinosaurs\", stalking juvenile \"Torosaurus\" and attempting to steal eggs from \"Tyrannosaurus\", despite never coexisting with the latter in real life.\n\"Dromaeosaurus\" makes an appearance in \"Jurassic Fight Club\", where a pack is shown being capable of taking down \"Edmontosaurus\" in spite of the carnivores' small size, but the carcass is later taken by a \"Tyrannosaurus\" (despite the tyrannosaur not being contemporaneous with \"Dromaeosaurus\")."}

In addition, there was a discussion about women's rights. President Nicolas Sarkozy said that a reason for the ban is to protect women from being forced to cover their faces.\nThe bill which was introduced, was protested by some women as a violation of women's rights.

He was the first Astronomer Royal, appointed in 1675.\nFlamsteed calculated the solar eclipses of 1666 and 1668.\nHe was responsible for several of the earliest recorded sightings of the planet Uranus, which he mistook for a star and catalogued as '34 Tauri'. The first of these was in December 1690, which remains the earliest known sighting of Uranus by an astronomer.\nStar catalogue and atlas.\nFlamsteed is also remembered for his conflicts with Isaac Newton, the President of the Royal Society at the time. Flamsteed was refusing to publish work commissioned by the king, so in 1712 Newton and Edmond Halley published a preliminary version of Flamsteed's \"Historia Coelestis Britannica\". They did so \"without crediting the author\".\nSome years later, Flamsteed managed to buy many copies of the book, and publicly burnt them in front of the Royal Observatory. However, the numerical star designations in this book are still used and are known as Flamsteed designations.\nIn 1725 Flamsteed's own version of \"Historia Coelestis Britannica\" was published posthumously, edited by his wife Margaret. This contained Flamsteed's observations, and included a catalogue of 2,935 stars to much greater accuracy than any previous work. This was considered the first significant contribution of the Greenwich Observatory. In 1729 his wife published his \"Atlas Coelestis\", assisted by Joseph Crosthwait and Abraham Sharp, who were responsible for the technical side."}

Halley is best known for computing the orbit of the comet named after him: Halley's Comet.\nCareer.\nOn leaving Oxford, in 1676, Halley visited the south Atlantic island of St. Helena and set up an observatory with a telescope which had no tube.\nHe used the telescope to study stars from the Southern Hemisphere. He later published \"Catalogus Stellarum Australium\" which was about the 341 southern stars.\nIn 1686, Halley published the second part of the results from his St. Helena expedition. This was a paper and chart on trade winds and monsoons. He thought solar heating caused atmospheric motions. He also established the relationship between barometric pressure and height above sea level. His charts were an advance in how to display information visually. Halley also persuaded Sir Isaac Newton to publish a book about his discovery of gravity.\nIn 1690, Halley built a diving bell, a device in which the atmosphere was replenished by way of weighted barrels of air sent down from the surface. In a demonstration, Halley and five companions dived to 60 feet in the River Thames, and remained there for over an hour and a half. Halley's bell was of little use for practical salvage work, as it was very heavy, but he made improvements to it over time, later extending his underwater exposure time to over 4 hours.\nThat same year, at a meeting of the Royal Society, Halley introduced a rudimentary working model of a magnetic compass using a liquid-filled housing to damp the swing and wobble of the magnetized needle.\nIn 1691 Halley sought the post of Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford University. As he was well known as an atheist, he was opposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Tillotson. The post went instead to a mathematician who had the support of Isaac Newton.\nDemography.\nIn 1693 Halley published an article on life annuities (a kind of pension), which featured an analysis of age-at-death on the basis of the Breslau statistics Caspar Neumann had been able to provide. This article allowed the British government to sell life annuities at an appropriate price based on the age of the purchaser. Halley's work strongly influenced the development of actuarial science. The construction of the life-table for Breslau, which followed more primitive work by John Graunt, is now seen as a major event in the history of demography.\nNamed after Halley.\nThese are generally either , rhyming with \"valley\", or \"\"Hailey\",\" though some people will use Halley's supposed pronunciation of his own name, \"\"Hawley\".\" The \"Hailey\" pronunciation inspired the rock and roll singer Bill Haley to call the rest of his band his \"Comets\" after Halley's Comet."}

{"id": "268463", "revid": "964135", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268463", "title": "Ionization energy", "text": "Ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the most loosely attached electron from an atom. The atom is not connected to any other atoms. The chemical elements to the left of the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy. The ones to the right have a much higher ionization energy. The chemical elements down the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy (due to electrons being farther away from the atom with increasing atomic radius). The ionization energy increases as each electron is removed.\nIonization energies are dependent upon the\" atomic radius\". Since going from right to left on the periodic table, the atomic radius increases, and the ionization energy increases from left to right in the periods and up the groups. Exceptions to this trend is observed for alkaline earth metals (group 2) and nitrogen group elements (group 15). Typically, group 2 elements have ionization energy greater than group 13 elements and group 15 elements have greater ionization energy than group 16 elements. Groups 2 and 15 have completely and half-filled electronic configuration respectively, thus, it requires more energy to remove an electron from completely filled orbitals than incompletely filled orbitals.\nAlkali metals (IA group) have small ionization energies, especially when compared to halogens or VII A group. In addition to the radius (distance between nucleus and the electrons in outermost orbital), the number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron(s) you're looking at in the outermost shell have an effect on the ionization energy as well. This effect, where the full positive charge of the nucleus is not felt by outer electrons due to the negative charges of inner electrons partially canceling out the positive charge, is called shielding. The more electrons shielding the outer electron shell from the nucleus, the less energy required to expel an electron from said atom. The higher the \"shielding effect\" the lower the ionization energy. It is because of the shielding effect that the ionization energy decreases from top to bottom within a group. From this trend, Cesium is said to have the lowest ionization energy and Fluorine is said to have the highest ionization energy (with the exception of Helium and Neon).\n1st, 2nd, and 3rd Ionization Energies.\nThe \"first ionization energy is the\" energy required to take away an electron from a neutral atom and the \"second ionization energy\" is the energy required to take away an electron from an atom with a +1 charge and so on. Each succeeding ionization energy is larger than the preceding energy.\nThe Effects of Electron Shells on Ionization Energy.\nElectron orbitals are separated into various shells which have strong impacts on the ionization energies of the various electrons. For instance, let us look at aluminum. Aluminum is the first element of its period with electrons in the 3p shell. This makes the first ionization energy comparably low to the other elements in the same period, because it only has to get rid of one electron to make a stable 3s shell, the new valence electron shell. However, once you've moved past the first ionization energy into the second ionization energy, there is a large jump in the amount of energy required to expel another electron. This is because you now are trying to take an electron from a fairly stable and full 3s electron shell."}

Finally, it may be used for prisoners who are at high risk of being attacked by other inmates, such as pedophiles, celebrities, or witnesses who are in prison themselves. This form of solitary confinement is sometimes called protective custody.\nIn the US Federal Prison system, solitary confinement is known as the Special Housing Unit (SHU), .

It is a very famous college because it is very old and it has a world-famous choir.\nThe college was founded in 1441. Its full name is \"The King's College of Our Lady and St. Nicholas in Cambridge\". The students at the university usually just call it \"King's\". \nHistory.\nKing's was founded in 1441 by King Henry VI. At first the college was going to be quite small, but by 1445 the college was going to be a magnificent building to show how important the king was. The king gave the college a lot of money for several feudal privileges. \nKing Henry VI had admired what William of Wykeham had done when founding the twin colleges of New College, Oxford and Winchester College in 1379. He copied a lot of Wykeham's ideas when building King's and Eton College. These colleges still have the same tie as part of their uniform.\nOriginally, the college was just for boys from Eton College. It was not until 1865 that other people could study there. King's does not have any strong connection now with Eton, although there is still a scholarship for a student from Eton to study at King's. \nAlthough building began in 1441, the project was interrupted by wars and it was not until 1544 that the inside was finished.\nBy this time King Henry VIII was King of England.\nHenry VI is still remembered at the College: each year, on the Saturday after the end of Autumn Term (which in Cambridge is called the \"Michaelmas term\"), is Founder's Day. It begins with a service in the chapel: the \"Founder's Eucharist\". This is followed by a Founder's Breakfast with ale and finally a big dinner called \"Founder's Feast\" to which all members of College in their last year of studies are invited.\nKing's College Chapel.\nThe College Chapel is built in the style of late Gothic architecture. It was built over a period of a hundred years (1446\u20131531) in three stages. The Chapel has the world's largest fan vault, stained glass windows, and the painting \"The Adoration of the Magi\" by Rubens.\nMany concerts and college events take place here. The world-famous Chapel choir consists of choral scholars (male students from the college) and choristers (boys educated at the nearby King's College School). The choir sings services on most days in term-time, and also performs concerts and makes recordings and broadcasts. Every Christmas it sings the service called Nine Lessons and Carols which is shown on BBC television as well as heard on the radio.\nThe Chapel is so famous that it is seen as a symbol of Cambridge, and appears on the logo of the city council.\nEducation at King's.\nNearly all subjects that can be studied at Cambridge can be studied at King's. There is a big library which includes some rare books and manuscripts.\nStudent intake and life.\nTraditionally students have come from independent schools (so-called \"public schools\"), but today the college has gradually started to include many students from state schools.\nAs with all Cambridge colleges King's has its own student unions both for undergraduates and for graduates.\nThe student union has a long record of activism. In the 1980s a long strike against the college's investment in apartheid South Africa was organised.\nThe Cellar Bar is a small room in the basement of the college, which is used for music. The main bar at King's is far older. The bar has been traditionally painted a socialist red, including a picture of a hammer and sickle. In 2004 it was redecorated, with the walls painted yellow and the overall d\u00e9cor lightened. A hammer and sickle survives in a frame on the wall. There is a lot of argument about this. King's also has a Coffee Shop next to the bar. A Vacation Bar, or \"vac bar\", also is sometimes open during the summer vacation, run by (and mainly for) the graduate students who stay in College throughout the year.\nMost Cambridge colleges celebrate May Week with a May Ball (which actually falls in June), but since the early 1980s King's has instead held a June Event (a more informal version of a May Ball) which they call King's Affair. The reason they have a different event from other colleges is because many students who were not invited used to forced their way into the party (so-called \"gatecrashing\"). A ticket usually costs around \u00a360 which is cheap compared to the May Ball tickets for other colleges which can cost up to \u00a3200.\nOnce someone has been admitted to the College, they become a member for life. For this reason, King's alumni (people who used to go there) are referred to as 'Non Resident Members'."}

Most people like baked goods that are risen, so leavening agents are popular.\nYeast.\nYeast is a common leavening agent. It is a fungus that converts sugar to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide makes the bread rise. This is slower and makes the bread more soft. Most of the ethanol evaporates when the bread is baked. The yeast is also killed when the bread is baked. \nYeast takes longer time to rise than chemical leavening agents. It can also be killed by heat or salt. Yeast is normally sold in small packages. These have yeast fungi. \nChemical leavening agents.\n\"Main articles: Baking powder and baking soda\"\nThere are several chemical leavening agents. For acidic foods, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) can be used. It reacts with the acid to make carbon dioxide gas, which makes the bread rise. For non-acidic foods, baking powder is used. Baking powder is a mix of a powdered acid and sodium bicarbonate. They react when dissolved in water to make carbon dioxide gas. Baking powder is more common.\nBaking powder and baking soda leavening is better for certain baked goods like muffins or cakes. The bread rises much faster with baking powder or baking soda. It is not affected by many other ingredients. But it does not have the same texture or taste that yeast has."}

He was known to eat a great number of sweet potato pies at a time believing they were an aphrodisiac. Sweet potato pie appears in the southern United States from the early colonial days. Like many sweet potato recipes, sweet potato pie was likely developed by the black slaves from traditional African cuisine. It is a staple of Soul food today. Recipes for sweet potato pie first appeared in printed cookbooks in the 18th century. It was included with savory vegetable dishes. By the 19th century, sweet potato pie was considered a dessert."}

It refers to the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era.p102 The period coincides with the invention of mechanical means of recording images: photography and film.\nThe term \"modern art\" is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.p419 Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art, including minimalism . More recent artistic production is often called Contemporary art or Postmodern art.\nHistory.\nModern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with 'wild', multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism.\nHenri Matisse's two versions of \"The Dance\" marked a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting. It reflected Matisse's fascination with primitive art: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism.\nPablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere and cone. With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions.\nAnalytic cubism was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, exemplified by \"Violin and Candlestick, Paris,\" from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by Synthetic cubism, practised by Braque, Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp and several other artists into the 1920s. Synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier coll\u00e9 and a large variety of merged subject matter.\nThe notion of modern art is closely related to Modernism.\nModern art was introduced to the United States in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I. It was only after World War II, however, that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements. The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of Abstract Expressionism, one of the most important of the later modernist art movements.\nAuction prices.\nModern art and Impressionism dominate the world art markets. Of the 20 top art prices, only one is a work of classical art. The world's highest price for a work of art is Jackson Pollock's \"No. 5, 1948\" privately sold by Sotheby's for (price adjusted) $151.2 million dollars. The modern paintings overtook the old masters in 1987."}

Robert Kraft, owner of Gillette Stadium and its tenants, the New England Patriots and New England Revolution, called it \"a fitting name for a border rivalry between schools who represent two of the original colonies.\" The game is scheduled to be held at the professional venue in both 2010 and 2011.\nThe two schools have played each other every year since 1952, with UMass holding a 43-26-3 advantage.

So, around the beginning of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein worked out his Theory of Relativity and people like Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg. and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger created quantum mechanics. \nHistory.\nSir Isaac Newton, and many scientists before him, helped create classical physics. They observed that some things in nature such as the falling of an apple occur the same way each time. Newton made equations that let him such events. He called these equations laws of physics. \nNewton's laws of physics have been tested by s and by using them in doing jobs. Sometimes things (like powerful winds) mess up the results of the experiment a bit, and the results come out a little wrong. But when people make efforts to get rid of these extra factors, the results of the experiments almost always get closer to what Newton's laws predict."}

The name derives from \"Huayang\", an alternate name for Sichuan province. \nIt lived about 165 million years ago, some 20 million years before its famous relative, \"Stegosaurus\" appeared in North America. At only 4.5 metres long, it was also much smaller than its famous cousin. Found in the Lower Shaximiao Formation, \"Huayangosaurus\" shared the local landscape with the sauropods \"Shunosaurus\", \"Datousaurus\", \"Omeisaurus\" and \"Protognathosaurus\", the ornithopod \"Xiaosaurus\" and the carnivorous \"Gasosaurus\".\nDescription.\nLike other stegosaurians, \"Huayangosaurus\" was a quadrupedal herbivore with a small skull and a spiked tail. Like its more famous relative, \"Stegosaurus\", \"Huayangosaurus\" bore the distinctive double row of plates that characterize all the stegosaurians. These plates rose vertically along its arched back. In \"Huayangosaurus\", the plates were more spike-like than in \"Stegosaurus\". Like \"Stegosaurus\", however, it bore two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of its tail.\n\"Huayangosaurus\" was one of the smallest known stegosaurians, at just 4.5\u00a0meters in length.\nDiscovery and species.\n\"Huayangosaurus\" remains from twelve individual animals were recovered from the Dashanpu Quarry near Zigong in Sichuan. The type species is \"H. taibaii\".\nClassification.\nAs it is the most basal stegosaurian, it is placed in within its own family \"Huayangosauridae\". It is also morphologically distinct from later (stegosaurid) forms. Its skull was broader and had premaxillary teeth in the front of its mouth. All later stegosaurians lost these teeth.\nPalaeobiology.\nLike many other stegosaurians, it had plates all down its back and spikes on its tail. Two large spikes were above its hips, and may have been used for deterring an attack from above (considering as it was a fairly short in height compared to later stegosaurians). Its plates were smaller than those of \"Stegosaurus\", with much less surface area. Thus they would have been much less effective heat regulators, one of the postulated functions of plates.\nPopular culture.\nMounted skeletons of \"Huayangosaurus\" are on display at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum in Zigong and the Municipal Museum of Chongqing in Sichuan Province in China."}

It was seen in modern art, graphic design, architecture and applied arts such as decoration, jewellery, ceramics and glass.p7 It peaked in popularity at the fin de si\u00e8cle of the late 19th century (1890\u20131905), and continued until the First World War.\nA reaction to academic art of the 19th century, Art Nouveau is organic in style. It has floral and plant-inspired motifs, and stylized, flowing curvilinear forms.p3-36 Art Nouveau is an approach to design according to which artists should work on everything from architecture to furniture, making art part of everyday life.\nThe movement was strongly influenced by Czech artist Alphonse Mucha. Mucha produced a lithographed poster as an advertisement for the play \"Gismonda\" by Victorien Sardou, starring Sarah Bernhardt. The poster appeared on 1 January 1895 in the streets of Paris. It was an overnight sensation, and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris. Initially called the \"Style Mucha\", this soon became known as \"Art Nouveau\".\nArt Nouveau's fifteen-year life was most strongly felt throughout Europe\u2014from Glasgow to Moscow to Madrid\u2014but its influence was global. In France, Hector Guimard's Paris Metro entrances shaped the landscape of Paris and Emile Gall\u00e9 was at the center of the school of thought in Nancy. Victor Horta had a decisive impact on architecture in Belgium.p37\nMagazines like \"Jugend\" helped spread the style in Germany, especially as a graphic design form, while the Vienna Secessionists influenced art and architecture throughout Austria-Hungary. Art Nouveau was also a movement of distinct individuals such as Gustav Klimt, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Alphonse Mucha, Ren\u00e9 Lalique, Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Louis Comfort Tiffany, each of whom interpreted it in their own individual manner.p34\nAlthough Art Nouveau fell out of favour with the arrival of 20th-century modernist styles, it is seen today as an important bridge between Neoclassicism and modernism.\nArt Nouveau monuments are now recognized by UNESCO on their World Heritage Sites list as significant contributions to cultural heritage. The historic center of Riga, Latvia, with \"the finest collection of art nouveau buildings in Europe\", was inscribed on the list in 1997 in part because of the \"quality and the quantity of its Art Nouveau/Jugendstil architecture\". Four Brussels town houses by Victor Horta were included in 2000 as \"works of human creative genius\" that are \"outstanding examples of Art Nouveau architecture brilliantly illustrating the transition from the 19th to the 20th century in art, thought, and society\"."}

Prosauropods dating from the late Triassic period, about 230 million years ago, have been discovered in Madagascar. \nAfrica is rich in Triassic and Lower Jurassic dinosaurs. African dinosaurs from these time periods include \"Syntarsus\", \"Dracovenator\", \"Melanorosaurus\", \"Massospondylus\", \"Euskelosaurus\", \"Heterodontosaurus\", \"Abrictosaurus\", and \"Lesothosaurus\". The Middle Jurassic is poorly represented in Africa. Only the three sauropods \"Cetiosaurus\", \"Lapparentosaurus\", and \"Archaeodontosaurus\" have been discovered dating from this time period. \nThe Upper Jurassic, however, is well represented in Africa, mainly thanks to the spectacular Tendaguru Formation, a Lagerst\u00e4tte in southeastern Tanzania. \"Allosaurus\", \"Ceratosaurus\", \"Elaphrosaurus\", \"Giraffatitan\", \"Dicraeosaurus\", \"Janenschia\", \"Tornieria\", \"Tendaguria\", \"Kentrosaurus\", and \"Dryosaurus\" are among the dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from Tendaguru. This fauna seems to show strong similarities to that of the Morrison Formation in the United States and the Lourinha Formation in Portugal. For example, \"Allosaurus\", \"Ceratosaurus\", and \"Dryosaurus\" have been found in both the Tendaguru and the Morrison. This has important biogeographical implications. This means the animals could travel between most continents at that time (Pangaea).\nThe Lower Cretaceous in Africa is known primarily from the northern part of the continent, particularly Niger. \n\"Suchomimus\", \"Elrhazosaurus\", \"Spinostropheus\", \"Rebbachisaurus\", \"Nigersaurus\", \"Kryptops\", \"Nqwebasaurus\", and \"Paranthodon\" are some of the early Cretaceous dinosaurs known from Africa. The early Cretaceous was an important time for the dinosaurs of Africa because it was when Africa finally separated from South America, forming the South Atlantic Ocean. This was an important event because now the dinosaurs of Africa started developing endemism because of isolation.\nThe Upper Cretaceous of Africa is known mainly from North Africa. During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous, North Africa was home to a rich dinosaur fauna. It includes \"Spinosaurus\", \"Carcharodontosaurus\", \"Rugops\", \"Bahariasaurus\", \"Deltadromeus\", \"Paralititan\", \"Aegyptosaurus\", and \"Ouranosaurus\". During the latest Cretaceous, at the end of the Age of Dinosaurs, \"Majungasaurus\", \"Masiakasaurus\", \"Rapetosaurus\", and the flying dromaeosaurid \"Rahonavis\" lived in Africa. \nTimeline.\nThis is a timeline of selected dinosaurs from the list above.

Taking refuge in Delbert's study, Jim discovers the sphere is a map to the legendary Treasure Planet.\nDoppler commissions a ship called the RLS Legacy, on a mission to search for Treasure Planet. The ship is captained by the cat-like, free-spirited Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson), and the stone-skinned Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne); the crew is secretly led by the half-robot cook Long John Silver (Brian Murray), who Jim suspects is the cyborg that Bones warned him about. Jim is sent to work in the galley, where Silver and his shapeshifting pet alien Morph supervise him. Although Jim does not trust Silver, they form a tenuous father-son relationship.\nOn the voyage, the ship encounters a supernova. While Jim secures the lifelines, he saves Silver just in time. The supernova then devolves into a black hole, and Mr. Arrow falls to his death into the abyss. As Amelia mourns Arrow, she suspects Jim failed to secure his lifeline, when it was really severed by the treacherous crablike pirate Scroop (Michael Wincott).\nAs the ship approaches Treasure Planet, Jim eavesdrops on the crew and discovers that they are following Silver, which leads to a mutiny. Jim, Doppler, Amelia and Morph escape, but the map is left behind. Silver, thinking that Jim has the map, targets to kill him, but hesitates; Amelia ends up being wounded when the fugitives are shot down in the escape.\nWhile Jim explores Treasure Planet's jungles, the group come across the eccentric robot B.E.N. (Martin Short), who has lost his primary memory and invites them to his home for shelter, where the group are cornered by the pirates; Using a back door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return to the ship in an effort to recover the map. Scroop attacks them, but ends up falling into the abyss. The group obtain the map, but end up being caught by Silver (who has captured Doppler and Amelia) when they return.\nSilver coerces Jim into using the map, which can open a portal to any location in the universe, which leads Jim to realize this was how Flint conducted his raids. The portal to Treasure Planet is opened, and the group discover the planet is a giant space station which Flint commandeered in order to store his loot. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds Flint's skeleton, holding the missing piece of B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. After reinserting it, B.E.N. immediately remembers that Flint rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. As the planet falls apart, Silver, in a desperate attempt not to leave emptyhanded, tries to escape on a boat loaded with treasure, but sacrifices the treasure to save Jim. The survivors escape to the ship, but it is damaged and becomes unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the ship to the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to the Montressor Spaceport, and he and the crew clear the destruction.\nJim discovers Silver has escaped below decks. Jim allows Silver to leave, and Silver gives Jim Morph, as well as providing him some of the treasure he rescued before the planet's destruction to help him rebuild the Benbow Inn; as he leaves, Silver tells Jim he will \"rattle the stars\". Amelia offers Jim a recommendation to the Interstellar Academy, before he returns to the spaceport to reunite with his mother. Sometime later, a celebration is held at the rebuilt Inn; Doppler and Amelia marry and have children, and Jim becomes a military cadet. During the party, Jim sees an image of Silver in the clouds, smiling proudly.\nVideo games.\nSeveral \"Treasure Planet\" video games were released. In October 2002, Disney Interactive released the naval strategy game \"\" for the PC, while in November, Sony Computer Entertainment released two separate \"Treasure Planet\" action video games for the PlayStation (developed by Magenta Software) and PlayStation 2 (developed by Bizarre Creations). Bizarre Creations used Softimage's XSI engine for modeling, texturing and animation, and released a Making-of video on their Facebook page in 2008. A Game Boy Advance game based on the film was also released.\nA series of games collectively called \"Disney's Treasure Planet: Training Academy\" (or \"Disney's Treasure Planet Collection\") was also released in 2002. It was composed of three games (\"Broadside Blast\", \"Treasure Racer\", and \"Etherium Rescue\"), and players with all three games could unlock a fourth game (\"Ship Shape\")."}

They usually move from the southern United States to the northern South America. Its scientific name, \"Crocodylus acutus\", means \"Pointy-snouted crocodile\". It is because of the shape of its snout.\nCharacteristics.\nThe American crocodile is a species of a crocodile with a high adult survival rate. The American crocodiles can live for a long time. Like all crocodiles, the American crocodile has four short legs; a long, powerful tail; and scaly skin.\nThe nostrils, eyes, and ears are on the top of its head, so the rest of the body can be hidden underwater for surprise attacks Camouflage also helps it catch food. The snout is longer and narrower than that of the American alligator. American crocodiles are paler and more grayish than the dark-hued American alligator. The American crocodile crawls on its belly. It can also \"high walk\". Big ones can run as fast as nearly 16 km/h (10 mph). They can swim at as fast as 32 km/h (20 mph).\nThe average length for adult in the continental rivers can be 2.9 to 4 m (9 ft 6 in to 13 ft 1 in) long. Males weigh up to 382 kg (842 lb). Females can be 2.5 to 3 m (8 ft 2 in to 9 ft 10 in) and weigh up to 173 kg (381 lb).\nBiology and behavior.\nAmerican crocodiles are more vulnerable to cold weather than American alligators. While an American crocodile cannot survive in water temperatures of 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) and below. American crocodiles will lose consciousness and drown due to hypothermia in that temperature. American crocodiles have a faster growth rate than alligators.\nFeeding.\nAmerican crocodiles feed mostly on fish, but big ones may prey on bigger animals, such as deer.\nAmerican crocodiles are a somewhat aggressive crocodile species and have been known to attack humans. Attacks on humans are rare, but happen more often in Mexico.\nDistribution.\nThe American crocodile's range in southern Florida overlaps with that of the closely related American alligator. However, while the American alligator's range stretches as far north as Virginia, the American crocodile's range in the United States is confined to southern Florida. \nThis is because alligators are much better at tolerating cold weather than crocodiles. The body temperature of alligators has been known to drop to 38 degrees Fahrenheit without any harm at all to the alligator. However, the American crocodile is better at tolerating saltwater than the alligator. American crocodiles have regularly been sighted 140 miles away from shore in the Caribbean Sea."}

{"id": "268744", "revid": "663032", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268744", "title": "Aztec Empire", "text": "The Aztec Empire was a large empire in Central America. It existed between about 1345 AD and 1521 AD. When the Empire was largest, it spread across most of Mesoamerica. \nDuring that time, the Aztecs built one of the world's most advanced societies. The Aztec Empire was also very powerful. Its warriors took over many nearby states and helped spread Aztec culture and religion across Mesoamerica. \nHowever, in 1519, Spanish conquistadors came to the Aztec Empire. With help from the Aztecs' enemies, the Spanish fought the Aztecs for control of their empire. On August 13, 1521, the Aztec Empire fell apart and the Spanish took over. They made the area a Spanish colony and renamed it New Spain.\nHistory.\nBefore the Aztec Empire existed, the indigenous (native) people in central Mesoamerica lived in many separate city-states. These were small cities with farmland around them. Each state had its own ruler. Around 1100 AD, these city-states started to fight each other for power and control of the area's land.\nBy about 1400, two city-states had grown into small empires. In 1428, these two empires fought the Tepanec War for control of the area. The Texcoco empire made an alliance with some other powerful city-states, including Tenochtitlan, and won the war. These allies were supposed to share power equally as they started to gain control of more land. However, by 1430, Tenochtitlan became the most powerful member of the alliance. It became the capital city of the Aztec Empire, and its ruler became the 'high king' of the entire Empire.\nGrowth.\nFrom 1430 onward, the Aztec Empire grew. Its military took over most of what is now northern Mexico. At this point, the Aztec Empire controlled 135,000 square kilometres (almost 84,000 square miles) of Mesoamerica.p.453\nWhen the Aztecs took over a state, they would take prisoners for ritual human sacrifice in Tenochtitlan. The state would also have to pay the Aztec Empire \"tributes\" (almost like taxes). As the Aztecs took over more and more states, these tributes made them very rich.\nSometimes, when the Aztecs took over a state, they would bring that state and its people into the Aztec Empire. However, if a state was on the edge of the Empire, the Aztecs might let it stay its own state. They did this so they would have other states around the Empire, protecting them from an invasion by other powerful states.\nTenochtitlan.\nThe Aztecs had built their capital city right on a lake called Lake Texcoco. As the Empire grew, so did Tenochtitlan. By the early 1500s, at least 200,000 people lived in the city. This made Tenochtitlan the largest city in the Americas before Christopher Columbus arrived.\nTenochtitlan was the center of the Aztec government and religion. It was also a very big trading center. When the Spanish arrived in 1519, they guessed that 60,000 people came to the market in Tenochtitlan every day. People bought and sold many things there, including slaves (prisoners of war from states the Aztecs had taken over). The city had a huge pyramid called the Templo Mayor (Great Temple). The entire city was decorated with art, architecture, and stone sculptures.\nThe Aztecs had created canals all across the city. By bringing water to Aztec crops, these canals made it possible for the Aztecs to grow much more food than they normally could have. The Aztecs had also made levees to protect the city from flooding, and reservoirs for fresh water.\n&lt;br&gt;\nSociety.\nAt its most powerful, the Aztec Empire controlled about 11,000,000 people. Among these people, there were different social classes with different social statuses. The most important people were the rulers. Next were nobles. These were the Empire's powerful members of the government; great warriors; judges; and priests. These people enjoyed a high social status.\nThe next social class was the commoners (common people). These were the Empire's everyday workers. Most of them farmed, ran stores, or traded. Commoners were allowed to own land as a group or a family. However, a single person was not allowed to own land.\nThe lowest social classes in Aztec society were serfs and then slaves. Slaves had no rights at all. However, if they had the money, they could buy their own freedom and become commoners.\nFor most of the Aztec Empire's existence, it was very difficult to move between social classes. Usually, if a person was born in a social class, they would stay in that class for the rest of their life.\nEducation.\nBy age 15, all children in the Aztec Empire had to go to school, no matter what social class they were in. This was very unusual for the time. In other places, like Europe, only boys were allowed to go to school, and only rich people could pay to send their children to school.\nUntil they were 15, children were taught by their parents. Once they turned 15, all children had to go to school. For most boys, the most important part of going to school was to make them the best possible warriors for the Empire.\nChildren of commoners went to schools called \"telpochcalli\" ('youth houses'). Boys got military training, while girls were taught how to do religious ceremonies. Both boys and girls were also taught about Aztec religion, morals, and history. They also learned singing, dancing, and public speaking.\nThe nobles' children went to a school called a \"calmecac\". Its goal was to get the children ready for jobs as the Empire's leaders. These included jobs as military or government leaders; priests; scholars; teachers; and healers. These schools taught about things like astronomy, geometry, mathematics, debate, law, music, poetry, architecture, agriculture, and war. Boys had to eat and sleep at their schools. They usually started at age 15 and left around age 20 to get married. Girls could become priestesses or work in medicine, helping other women give birth.\nMarriage.\nWhen a young person was ready to get married, their education would end. This usually happened in their late teenage years or early twenties. Especially with nobles, marriages were arranged. This meant children's parents, or possibly other older people in the community, would choose who a person married. Many marriages among noble youth were arranged as a power strategy (for example, to unite an Aztec with a family from a state that was recently taken over). Marriage ceremonies lasted four days.\nAztec men were allowed to have other wives as well as concubines. However, they were also expected to raise their sons, which was unusual for ancient societies (where women usually did all of the child-raising).\nAztec society also gave women rights that few other societies gave at the time. Even after marrying, an Aztec woman's property and money were still her own; they did not go to her husband. Women were also allowed to work in medicine, education, religion, and trade.\nMorals.\nThe Aztecs had strict rules and punishments for people who broke Aztec morals. For example, things like disorderly conduct (causing trouble in public), drunkenness, could be punished by execution.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMilitary.\nAll adult men in the Empire had to be in the Aztec military. Men from states that had alliances with the Aztecs also fought in the Aztec military. So did some men from states that the Aztecs had taken over. Because of this, the Aztec military was large and powerful. \nAt this time, most battles were fought in big cities. If an army took over one of a state's biggest cities, it was then allowed to take control over all the land around those cities.\nAztec warriors protected themselves with thick cotton armour. They also had shields made of wood or reeds, and covered in dried animal skins.\nFor weapons, warriors had a few choices:\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nReligion.\nThe Aztecs were pantheistic, meaning they believed in many different gods. Two of the most important gods they worshipped were \"Huitzilopochtli\", the god of war and the sun, and \"Tlaloc\", the rain god. The Aztecs set up temples specifically to honor these gods at the top of the pyramid in Technochtitlan. However, they also worshipped hundreds of other gods. Each one controlled some part of human life (like \"Quetzalcoatl\", the god of learning and civilization), or some part of nature (like \"Zipe Totec\", the god of springtime and regrowth).\nIn the Aztecs' religion, the sun was very important. The Aztecs believed that the world went through five stages, and each had its own sun. At the end of each stage, the gods would destroy the world and create a new one but only four times. They thought they were living in the fifth and last stage, and that the gods could decide to destroy the world at any minute.\nKeeping the gods happy.\nThe Aztecs did many things to try to honor the gods and keep them happy. For example, they threw festivals, had banquets, made statues, and buried valuable items, all as offerings to the gods. They did penance, like cutting themselves and letting blood run out, to try to get the gods to forgive them for whatever they might have done wrong. They did ritual sacrifice of animals (killing the animals as part of a religious ritual).\nLike many other ancient civilizations, the Aztecs also sacrificed human beings to the gods.\nAs Mesoamerican scholar Mark Cartwright explains:\nThe Aztecs sacrificed people in three different ways:\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCulture.\nSome historians say the Aztecs had a \"culture of war.\" This means that everything focuses on making people into good warriors and people who support war. One textbook says:\nHowever, there were many parts to the Aztec culture. They studied astrology and used the movements of the planets and the stars to create different calendars. They understood and taught things like mathematics and poetry. They had a complex view of religion, the universe, and many other things.\nArt and architecture.\nAztec culture respected and appreciated art. They collected pieces of art from all over their Empire to decorate Tenochtitlan. They also formed guilds of artisans people who specialized in making certain kinds of art. They made paintings, pottery, carvings, and many other things. They used all sorts of materials, including gold, silver, amethyst, wood, and stone. Huge stone sculptures were a popular type of art. Aztec artists made their pyramid and other stone buildings into art too, by carving into them.\nThe Aztecs used symbolism in their art. They even used art as propaganda. For example, when they took over a state, they would build temples and statues with Aztec symbols on them. They also used paintings that showed Aztec rulers as being close to the gods, doing what the gods wanted them to do. This art spread Aztec religion and culture, and also reminded states that had been taken over just how powerful the Aztec Empire was.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEnd of the Empire.\nFrom 1519-1521, Spanish conquistadors, led by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, defeated the Aztec Empire. They made the Empire into a Spanish colony which they called New Spain.\nOriginally, things between the Spanish and the Aztecs were friendly.\nHowever, soon, while Cort\u00e9s was away, Spanish soldiers attacked and killed many Aztecs during a festival. The Aztecs fought back, and they killed two out of every three Spanish soldiers. The conquistadors left Tenochtitlan.\nTen months later, Cort\u00e9s came back to Tenochtitlan with more soldiers. They started a siege of Tenochtitlan, so that no food or supplies could get in. After 91 days, without any food, and with disease throughout the city, the new emperor Cuauhtemoc finally surrendered to the Spanish on August 13, 1521. The Spanish destroyed Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire had ended.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

There is hot dip galvanising, where the object is dipped in a pool of liquid zinc. This makes a thicker coating that lasts a long time.

It has no valves or other mechanisms, the only way the player has to control the pitch is changing the shape of his lips. This means that only notes from the harmonic series can be played.\nHistory.\nThe bugle comes from instruments made from animal horns. The earliest bugles were shaped in a loop \u2013 usually a double loop, but sometimes triple or single \u2013 similar to the modern French horn, and were usually used to send messages during hunts. Predecessors and relatives of the developing bugle included the post horn, the Pless horn, and the bugle horn.\nThe first use of a brass horn as a military signal was the Halbmondblaser, meaning \"half-moon blower\", used in Hanover in 1758. It was U-shaped (this is where its name comes from) and easily carried with a shoulder strap. It first arrived in England in 1764 where it was slowly it became used often by foot soldiers. Cavalry did not normally use a proper bugle, but instead used an early trumpet that made a sound which was easier to hear from nearby, but travelled less far.\nUses.\nThe bugle is used mainly in the military where the bugle call is used to make announcements. A long time ago, the bugle was used in the cavalry to pass instructions from officers to soldiers during battle. In the Bible, bugles are found in the time of Moses, when God commanded Moses to 'make two bugles of hammered silver' in Numbers 10:1-3. They were used to assemble the leaders and to give marching orders to the camps.\nIn the drum and bugle corps the bugle has changed from its military origins, and now has valves. In American drum and bugle corps, G is considered the traditional key for bugles to be pitched in. However, current rules in both Drum Corps International and Drum Corps Associates define a bugle as a brass instrument in any key, with 0 to 4 valves, and bell front.\nCivilian drum corps were made using instruments sold off by the military in the early 1900s, and the last official change made to the military bugle (before it stopped being used because of the invention of the radio) was to make them all use the key of G. Bugles in other parts of the world used to be in B flat or E flat.\nThe bugle is also used in the Boy Scouts. They use some of the same calls as the military, but not all.\nVariations.\nThe cornet is sometimes wrongly considered to be the \"valved version\" of the bugle, although it comes from the French \"cornet de poste\" (post horn).\n19th century versions based on the original bugle included keys and valves. Keyed bugles were invented in England in the early 19th century, with a patent for one design, the Royal Kent bugle, taken out by Joseph Halliday in 1811. This bugle was highly popular and widely in use until around 1850 \u2013 for example, in works by Richard Willis, later bandmaster of the United States Military Academy Band at West Point. This version of the bugle stopped being used when the valved cornet was invented.\nModern instruments considered bugles often have valves."}

He was best known for his abstract monumental sculptures, which are public works of art in many places around the world.\nHis forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works usually suggest the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he did family groups. His forms are generally pierced or have hollow spaces. Some think the undulating form of his reclining figures reflect the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.\nMoore was born in Castleford, the son of a mining engineer. He became known for his larger-scale abstract cast bronze and carved marble sculptures. His large-scale commissions made him exceptionally rich. Yet he lived carefully and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation. This supports education and promotion of the arts.\nHe did some work in architecture. in 1955 Moore did his only work in carved brick, \"Wall Relief\" at the Bouwcentrum in Rotterdam. The brick relief was sculpted with 16,000 bricks by two Dutch bricklayers under Moore's supervision."}

It has colour, lines and shapes (form), but they are not intended to represent objects or living things. Often the artists were influenced by ideas and philosophies of abstraction.\nAbstract art is found in painting and in sculpture. There are also many works of art which are partly abstract, and partly representational. Many artists worked in abstract and other types of modern art.\nPurely abstract art is a 20th-century invention. It grew out of the earlier forms of modern art, but it is perhaps the one movement which is absolutely modern. It has no roots in earlier art (as we use the term today).\nEarly years.\nOne of the first to achieve complete abstract paintings was Kazimir Malevich, who presented a completely black square in 1913. He was a Suprematist, an art movement based on simple geometrical shapes. Art based on geometry is a kind of geometric abstraction. Wassily Kandinsky painted a famous work \"Composition VII\" in 1913, which was completely abstract and very complex.\nThe case of Manierre Dawson, an American from Chicago, is very interesting. During a tour of Europe in 1910, he started painting true abstract works. Back in the United States, he became convinced that he could not earn a living at art, and became a farmer. He was forgotten until a rediscovery in 1963. He may have been the first person to paint a completely abstract work.\nThere are many hundreds of other artists who painted abstracts. Piet Mondrian and the sculptor Henry Moore deserve mention for their wide influence on other artists.\nAbstract expressionism.\nAfter World War II, abstract art became a dominant form of art in the United States, with some outstanding exponents. Immigrants such as Mondrian, Max Ernst and Mark Rothko, and native-born Americans such as Barnett Newman and Jackson Pollock became almost household names.\nAbstract expressionism is the name given to the American post-World War II art movement. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve worldwide influence and put New York City at the center of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. The term was used in 1919, but is more widely used for American work of the 1940s to 1960s. Of the previous generation of painters, Kandinsky is most clearly an abstract expressionist.\nTechnically, an important predecessor was surrealism, with its Freudian emphasis on dreams, and on spontaneous, automatic or unconscious creation. Jackson Pollock's dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a method of using spontaneity. It was novel, and brought into play several factors. Action: movements, how the artist worked. Automatism and the unconscious: the work was planned, but details were not.\nAbstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics. The artists use large canvases, sometimes very large. There is an \"all-over\" approach: the whole canvas is treated with equal importance, as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges. The canvas as the arena became a credo of Action painting, while the integrity of the picture plane became a credo of the Color field painters.\nFive things to know.\nAccording to the Royal Academy, there are five things we should know about abstract expressionism:\nAction painting.\nPaintings such as those of Jackson Pollock which express the actions and movements of the painter.\nColour field painting.\nPaintings mainly of coloured shapes of a geometric or bulbous kind. Examples: Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Josef Albers"}

Despite his affiliation with the New Zealand Labour Party since age 17, Brown did not run for election in the 2005 General Election, and instead returned to working for Wynyard Wood.\nMayor of Manukau.\nBrown announced that he was running to be the Mayor of Manukau in 2006. Barry Curtis announced that he would not be running for re-election, and Brown's main opposition were former Olympic runner Dick Quax and radio host Willie Jackson. Brown resigned from Wynard Wood in 2007 to focus on his candidacy full time. In August 2007, both Quax and Brown were polling \"neck and neck\". Brown's campaign was based on several policies, including; capping rates at the cost of inflation, increasing public transport, and working with youth in the region.\nBrown won the election in October 2007 with more than 32,000 votes; his next closest rival Dick Quax had less than 18,000, and the election was jokingly called a 'Lenslide' by some. He was officially sworn in on 26 October 2007 at the Manukau City Council hall.\nOn 31 May 2008 he suffered a heart attack while at a music awards ceremony, and was admitted to Auckland Hospital. He had a congenital heart problem that had not been diagnosed before. Brown had successful heart bypass surgery two days later and made a full recovery, returning to his duties after a few months. His wife acknowledged that the attack was not stress-related, but rather a family issue, with Len's mother having died from a heart attack at 47.\nMayor of Auckland campaign.\nIn August 2009, Brown stated he would run for the mayoralty of the combined Auckland \"super-city\" in the Auckland mayoral election, 2010. Brown announced his candidacy in front of more than 300 supporters at Sorrento in the Park, One Tree Hill, Maungakiekie. His campaign speech focused on delivering public transport, public ownership of the region's public assets, environmental protection, economic and social development. He won the position by 60,000 votes over main rival candidate, Auckland City mayor John Banks, on 9 October 2010.\nIn June 2010, Brown came under media attention for matters relating to his spending on his council credit card and other council expense claims, which included items of a personal nature like toys, groceries and insect repellent. His later explanations for these purchases were also examined at a council meeting, where Brown repeatedly slapped his face and got emotional. An advisor later explained that Brown's emotional behaviour was caused by his use of a Maori tradition, which Brown said was not true.\nAnother council expense claim included an $810 dinner at a restaurant, but Brown refused to say who was there. He said that the event was a fundraiser for a local singer for which the Council bought a table, an explanation later supported by the artist.\nPrivate life.\nBrown is married to Shirley Anne Inglis, and has three children. They live in the Totara Park suburb of Manukau."}

It is a philosophical movement and political movement. The idea of progress is the belief that human society is improving over time. In the 18th century, many philosophers began holding this belief as part of the Age of Enlightenment.\nPolitical movement.\nProgressive politics generally wants to change government in a new way. Unlike conservatism which wants to keep government similar. It most often refers to a political movement in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, called the Progressive Era. In the United States, these people wanted to change politics, which was at that time run by big business and corrupt political machines. Most of the people who believed in the Progressive Movement were part of the middle class. Some of the leaders of the progressive movement were Theodore Roosevelt, Hiram Johnson , William Howard Taft, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Howard Dean."}

Prescott", "text": "William Hickling Prescott (May 4, 1796\u00a0\u2013 January 29, 1859) was an American historian who was interested in Spain and the Spanish Empire. He is known as one of the first great American historians. Prescott was made almost blind after a boy threw a piece of bread at his eye when he was sixteen. This meant that he could not work in a normal job.\nPrescott's grandfather was William Prescott, a soldier who fought for the United States in the American Revolutionary War. Prescott grew up in Boston, Massachusetts, which is a city on the east coast of the United States. When Prescott was 15, he went to Harvard University. After he got his degree, he studied many different topics, before deciding that he was interested in the history of Spain. He wrote many books about Spanish history, which were very popular. His work had a significant impact on the study of the history of Spain. \nEarly life.\nWilliam H. Prescott was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on May 4, 1796. He was the oldest of seven children, but four of his brothers and sisters died at a young age. His parents were William Prescott, Jr., a lawyer, and his wife, Catherine Greene Hickling. His grandfather William Prescott served as a colonel during the American Revolutionary War.\nPrescott first went to school when he was seven. The family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1808. Prescott went to Harvard University in 1811, at the age of 15. He was good at Latin and Greek, but found mathematics difficult. He graduated from Harvard in 1814.\nAfter he had graduated, Prescott traveled to the island of S\u00e3o Miguel in the Azores, where his grandfather and Portuguese grandmother lived. After staying there two weeks, he went to London, where he stayed with the famous surgeon Astley Cooper and the eye-expert William Adams. Prescott found it difficult to write because his eyesight was so poor, so Adams gave him a device called a noctograph to help him. \nHe visited Hampton Court Palace with John Quincy Adams, who was a diplomat in London. Adams later became President of the United States. In 1816, Prescott travelled in France and Italy. He met an American academic, George Ticknor in Paris. Ticknor became a very good friend of Prescott. Prescott returned to America in December 1816. He spent the next four years studying Italian and Spanish literature. He also married Susan Amory, the daughter of Thomas Coffin Amory and Hannah Rowe Linzee, on May 4, 1820.\nCareer.\nIn the 1820s, Prescott wrote two essays for the \"North American Review\", an American academic journal. Both were about Italian poetry. However, Prescott became interested in the history of Spain due to his friend George Ticknor, who had become professor of Spanish studies at Harvard University. Prescott decided that he wanted to write a book about Ferdinand and Isabella, who were King and Queen of Spain in the early 1500s, in January 1826. After gathering source material, Prescott started writing the \"History of Ferdinand and Isabella\" in October 1829. He had finished it by July 1836. It was published on Christmas Day, 1837 by the \"American Stationary Company\", which was based in Boston, with a print run of 500\u00a0copies. Prescott dedicated the book to his father. The book sold very well, and was published in London in 1838. Prescott later made a shortened version of the work. In recognition of this work, he was awarded three honorary doctorates, by Columbia University, College of William and Mary and South Carolina College. \nPrescott wrote three other books on the Spanish Empire. The first, \"The History of the Conquest of Mexico\", was written between 1838 and 1842 and published in 1843. It is thought to be one of the most important books written on ancient Mesoamerica. It was so popular at the time that John Y. Mason, the United States Secretary of the Navy had a copy placed in the library of every fighting ship. Today, it is still the best known and most popular work by Prescott. The \"Conquest of Mexico\" was followed by the \"Conquest of Peru\", which was written between 1843 and 1847, and published in March 1847. It was similarly successful. Prescott's last book, the \"History of the Reign of Phillip II\" was never finished and is not thought to be of the same quality as his other works. Prescott started work on it in 1842, but stopped in 1858 after suffering a stroke. "}

So if a man called Eric had a son called Leif, Leif's name would be Leif Ericsson. \nThe same is true for females, although sometimes women take the name of their father for their last name, or the name of their mother. Also, the suffix -dott\u00edr is added to the end of the parent's name. So, if a girl called Astrid's parents were Leif and Inga, then their daughter could be called either Astrid Leifsd\u00f3ttir, or Astrid Ingasd\u00f3ttir. \nChanges were announced to the laws about names in 2019. Given names are not limited by gender anymore. People that are registered officially with a non-binary gender will be able to use the suffix -bur (\"child of\") instead of -son or -d\u00f3ttir.\nThis naming system is the same naming system that was used by the Vikings. Iceland has kept this naming system because Iceland is an island, and had little contact with the outside world for quite some time, so there was not much change in things like customs, language and naming systems."}

The term is also used to refer to items made out of this material and to its natural, brownish orange color, which varies considerably. \nProduction and properties.\nClay is partially dried and cast, molded, or hand worked into the desired shape. After thorough drying, it is placed in a kiln, or atop combustible material in a pit, and then fired. \nAfter pit firing the hot ware is covered with sand to cool, and after kiln firing the kiln is slowly cooled. When unglazed, the material will not be waterproof, but it is suitable for in-ground use to carry pressurized water (an archaic use), for garden ware, and sculpture or building decoration in tropical environments, and for oil containers, oil lamps, or ovens. Most other uses such as for table ware, sanitary piping, or building decoration in freezing environments require that the material be glazed. Terracotta, if uncracked, will ring if lightly struck, but not as brightly as will ware fired at higher temperature, which is called stoneware. The fired material is weak compared to stoneware.\nSome types of terracotta are created from clay that includes recycled terracotta (\"grog\").\nThe unglazed color after firing can vary widely, but most common clays contain enough iron to cause an orange, orangish red, or brownish orange color, with this range including various colors described as \"terracotta\". Other colors include yellow, gray, and pink."}

Other words for this activity are yo-yo dieting or weight cycling. People's weight can move down and back up like a yo-yo when they follow several diets one after another. A person's weight after the diet is often higher than it was before dieting.\nThe Steps.\nThe steps to the weight cycle are normal eating, weight gain, diet, metabolism slow-down, and end of the diet. But they repeat again and that\u2019s the Yo-Yo effect. For example, Sherman Morrison talks about someone on the website healevate.com, saying, \u201cIn the 1990\u2019s she got up to 237 pounds, dropped it back down to 160 in the early 2000\u2019s, but then crept back up over 200. Recently, however, she shed 30 pounds using Weight Watchers.\u201d Which means she first gained weight, then she lost weight, and finally she gained it back. Basically, Morrison is describing that the Yo-Yo effect is gaining and losing weight over and over again.\nCauses.\nThe body needs less energy after losing weight on a diet. People have less fatty tissue and often less muscle after the diet. Muscle tissue needs more energy than fatty tissue. Reducing the amount of muscle tissue therefore reduces the need for energy. Also, limit the number of calories people take in. At some point, a dieter's body will change the way it uses energy if there are less calories to burn. The body does this to make sure it survives when less food is available. These changes in the body cause people to gain weight rapidly when they stop dieting and return to their old eating habits.\nAvoiding It.\nPeople can avoid the yo-yo effect by changing their diet. If a diet works without the body switching to a more efficient way of using calories, there will be no yo-yo effect. A diet should change the dieter's eating habits for a long time. New eating habits should not give the body more energy than it needs. At the end of the diet, it also makes sense to raise the number of calories someone eats slowly. Exercise and sports can increase the amount of calories burned by the body rather than turned into fat."}

{"id": "269100", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=269100", "title": "Futurism", "text": "Futurism was a modern art and social movement which originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It was largely an Italian phenomenon, though there were parallel movements in Russia, England and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre, movies, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture and even gastronomy.\nFuturism in Italy 1909\u20131916.\nThe founder of Futurism and its most influential personality was the Italian writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Marinetti launched the movement in his \"Futurist Manifesto\", which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in \"La gazzetta dell'Emilia\". This article was reprinted in the French daily newspaper \"Le Figaro\" on 20 February 1909. Marinetti was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr\u00e0, Giacomo Balla, Gino Severini and the composer Luigi Russolo.\nMarinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. \"We want no part of it, the past\", he wrote, \"we the young and strong \"Futurists!\"\" The Futurists admired speed, technology, youth and violence, the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature, and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, \"however daring, however violent\", bore proudly \"the smear of madness\", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.\nPublishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.\nThe founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme. The Futurists attempted to create it in their subsequent \"Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting\". This committed them to a \"universal dynamism\", which was to be directly represented in painting.\nIn practice, much of their work was influenced by Cubism, and indeed their images \"were\" more dynamic than those of Picasso and Braque. The phrase 'plastic dynamism' has been used to describe their early work.\nOne of the greatest patrons and financier of Futurism in Milan was the business magnante Antonio Bernocchi, he was also the creator and producer of the first example of Italian industrial design, inspired by futurism, that became known as \"Luminator Bernocchi\".\nLater.\nMany Italian Futurists supported Fascism in the hope of modernizing the country. Italy was divided between the industrial north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, radicals, admirers of violence, and were opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti was one of the first members of the National Fascist Party. He soon found the Fascists were not radical enough for him, but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944.\nThe Futurists' association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in architecture. After the Second World War, many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.\nThe Futurists renewed themselves again and again until Marinetti's death.\nThe legacy of Futurism.\nFuturism influenced many other twentieth century art movements, including Art Deco, Vorticism, Constructivism, Surrealism and Dadaism. Futurism was, like science fiction, in part overtaken by 'the future'.\nNonetheless, the ideals of futurism remain as part of modern Western culture: the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology is expressed in much of modern cinema and culture. Ridley Scott used design ideas of Sant'Elia in \"Blade Runner\".\nEchoes of Marinetti's thought, especially his \"dreamt-of metallization of the human body\", are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in manga/anime and the works of artists such as Shinya Tsukamoto, director of the \"Tetsuo\" (lit. \"Ironman\") films.\nFuturism influenced the literary genre of cyberpunk. Artists who came to prominence in the first flush of the internet, such as Stelarc and Mariko Mori, produced work influenced by Futurist ideas. A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement began in 1988 with the creation of the Neo-Futurist style of theatre in Chicago, which uses Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. There are active Neo-Futurist troupes in Chicago, New York, and Montreal."}

There are nine lessons (readings) and between each reading there is a carol sung, either by the choir on its own or by the whole congregation. The story is told from the beginning of the Bible in which Adam disobeys God, to the coming of the baby Jesus.\nThe form of the service was started by Edward White Benson who was Bishop of Truro in Cornwall, for use on Christmas Eve (24 December) 1880. The service is now used by other churches all over the world, not just in Anglican churches, but also in some Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches. In the UK, the service has become the standard form for schools' Christmas carol services.\nThe best-known Nine Lessons and Carols service is the one held in King's College, Cambridge every Christmas. The choir carols are sung by the famous Choir. This service has been broadcast by the BBC for more than half a century.\nService at King's College, Cambridge.\nThe first Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College, Cambridge, was held on Christmas Eve in 1918. The music at the first service was directed by Arthur Henry Mann, who was the organist from 1876 to 1929. The choir had 16 trebles which was the number that Henry VI said there must be when he founded the college. Until 1927 the men in the choir were choral scholars and lay clerks. Today, 14 undergraduates from the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, sing the men's parts.\nThe service was first broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1928 and, except for 1930, has been broadcast every year since, even throughout World War II in spite of the stained glass having been removed from the Chapel and the lack of heating. The service is slightly different today: not all the readings are from the Bible. Most of the carols are sung by the choir. There are generally more than nine carols. The service starts with the famous carol \"Once in Royal David's City\". Verse one is always sung as an unaccompanied solo by one of the boys in the choir. The boy is not told that he is the one who has been chosen to sing the solo until just before the service begins.\nSince 1982 the Director of Music has been Stephen Cleobury. Each year he commissions a composer to write a new carol for the Choir. The service ends with the carol \"O Come all ye faithful\". This is followed by the Organ Voluntary: \"In Dulci Jubilo\" (BWV 729) by Johann Sebastian Bach and then another Organ Piece (which is heard on the radio but not on television)."}

Usually a laborer or craftsman would have to work three to seven years in exchange for the cost of transportation across the ocean, food, clothing, land, a place to live and other things they needed to live or work during their contract. This kind of contract was called \"indenture.\" Indentures were quite common in Colonial America in the 17th and 18th centuries.\nColonial America.\nMany immigrants arrived in Colonial America as indentured servants. Their new master paid a ship's captain for the worker's trip across the Atlantic Ocean. Most were young men and women from England, Scotland and Germany under the age of 21. Their parents often made the arrangements. In the 17th and the early 18th centuries, most people who came to America were indentured servants.\nIndentured servants often had to do very hard labor on a farm or in a household. Often, they were no more than slaves for their indentures. During the 17th century, over half of indentured servants died before their indentures had ended.\nIn the 17th century, when people had served an indenture, they usually received a piece of land, usually 40 acres. However, by the 1690s, indentured servants were not getting land as often. That to led an attack on the Virginia government by Nathaniel Bacon and other indentured servants. After Bacon's Rebellion, the number of indentured servants decreased, and the South turned to slaves for its labor.\nThis type of contract has been common throughout world history in different forms. Usually, the worker became an indentured servant by choice.\nIndenture today.\nExamples.\nSome people claim that practices in the United Arab Emirates are examples of modern-day indentured servitude. Many workers from India and Pakistan must pay agents in their own countries for jobs in the Emirates. The recruiting agents take the workers passports after they enter the country. The workers do not know when they will get their passports back. The indentured servants get basic food and housing and transportation to the work place.\nLaws about indenture.\nThe United Nations passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948. Article 4 of the Declaration says that indenture, or servitude, is illegal. However, only laws in each country can stop it. In America, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000 expanded the definition of servitude."}

Lithography can be used to print text or artwork onto paper or other suitable material.\nIntroduction.\nLithography originally used an image drawn in wax or other oily substance applied to a lithographic stone as the medium to transfer ink to the printed sheet. In modern times, the image is often made of polymer applied to a flexible aluminium plate.\nThe flat surface of the plate or stone is slightly roughened, or etched, and divided into hydrophilic (= water-loving) regions that accept a film of water and repel the greasy ink, and hydrophobic regions which repel water and accept ink. The image may be printed directly from the stone or plate (in which case it is reversed from the original image) or may be offset by transfer to a flexible sheet, usually rubber, for transfer to the printed article.\nThis process is different from gravure or intaglio printing where a plate is engraved, etched or stippled to make cavities to contain the printing ink, and in woodblock printing and letterpress where ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images.\nIn the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of limestone was used (hence the name \"lithography\"\u2014\"lithos\" (\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2) is the ancient Greek word for stone). After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of gum arabic in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and avoided the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.\nChromolithography.\nChromolithography (colour lithography) was invented by Engelmann and son, who were granted a patent in 1837. After that, it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development.\nBy using more than one stone, different colours can be added to the same picture. Each colour needs a separate stone. The great posters of such artists as Alphonse Mucha and Toulouse-Lautrec are made like this. Complicated graphics may need twenty or more stones."}

The field is accompanied by a fundamental particle known as the Higgs boson, which is used by the field to continuously interact with other particles, such as the electron. Particles that interact with the field are \"given\" mass and, in a similar fashion to an object passing through a treacle (or molasses), will become slower as they pass through it. The result of a particle \"gaining\" mass from the field is the prevention of its ability to travel at the speed of light.\nMass itself is not generated by the Higgs field; the act of creating matter or energy from nothing would violate the laws of conservation. Mass is, however, gained by particles via their Higgs field interactions with the Higgs Boson. Higgs bosons contain the relative mass in the form of energy and once the field has endowed a formerly massless particle, the particle in question will slow down as it has now become \"heavy\". \nIf the Higgs field did not exist, particles would not have the mass required to attract one another, and would float around freely at light speed. \nGiving mass to an object is referred to as the Higgs effect. This effect will transfer mass or energy to any particle that passes through it. Light that passes through it gains energy, not mass, because its wave form doesn't have mass, while its particle form constantly travels at light speed.\nThe Higgs effect.\nThe Higgs effect was first theorized in 1964 by writers of the PRL symmetry breaking papers. In 1964, three teams wrote scientific papers which proposed related but different approaches to explain how mass could arise in local gauge theories.\nIn 2013 the Higgs boson, and implicitly the Higgs effect, were tentatively proven at the Large Hadron Collider (and the Higgs boson was discovered on July 4, 2012). The effect was seen as finding a missing piece of the Standard Model.\nAccording to gauge theory (the theory underlying the Standard Model), all force-carrying particles should be massless. However, the force-particles that mediate the weak force have mass. This is due to the Higgs effect, which breaks the SU(2) symmetry; (SU stands for special unitary, a type of matrix, and 2 refers to the size of the matrices involved).\nA symmetry of a system is an operation done to a system, such as rotation or displacement, that leaves the system fundamentally unchanged. A symmetry also provides a rule for how something should always act unless acted on by an outside force. An example is a Rubik's Cube. If we take a Rubik's cube and scrambled it by making whatever moves we want, it is still possible to solve it. Since each move we make still leaves the Rubik's cube solvable, we can say that these moves are 'symmetries' of the Rubik's cube. Together, they form what we call the symmetry group of the Rubik's cube. Making any of these moves doesn't change the puzzle, always leaving it solvable. But, we can break this symmetry by doing something like taking the cube apart, and putting it back together in a completely wrong way. No matter what moves we try now, it is not possible to solve the cube. Breaking the cube apart and putting it back together in the wrong way is the 'outside force': Without this outside force, nothing we do to the cube makes it unsolvable. The symmetry of the Rubik's cube is that it stays solvable whatever moves we make, as long as we do not take apart the cube.\nCreation of Higgs boson.\nThe way that the SU(2) symmetry is broken is known as \"spontaneous symmetry breaking\". Spontaneous means random or unexpected, Symmetries are the rules that are being changed, and Breaking refers to the fact that the symmetries are no longer the same. The result of spontaneously breaking the SU(2) symmetry can be a Higgs boson.\nReason for Higgs effect.\nThe Higgs effect occurs because nature \"tends\" towards the lowest energy state. The Higgs effect will happen because gauge bosons near a Higgs field will want to be in their lowest energy states, and this would break at least one symmetry. \nTo justify giving mass to a would-be massless particle, scientists were forced to do something out of the ordinary. They assumed that vacuums (empty space) actually \"had\" energy, and that way, if a particle that we think of as massless were to enter it, the energy from the vacuum would be transferred into that particle, giving it mass. A mathematician named Jeffrey Goldstone proved that if you violate a symmetry (for example, a symmetry with a Rubik's cube would be if you state that the corners must always be rotated 0 or 3 times to be solvable (it works)), a reaction will occur. In the case of the Rubik's cube, the cube will become unsolvable if violated. In the case of the Higgs field, something named after Jeffrey Goldstone (and another scientist who worked with him named Yoichiro Nambu) is produced, a Nambu-Goldstone boson. This is an excited or energetic form of the vacuum, which can be graphed revealing that shown above. This was first explained by Peter Higgs."}

It passed both houses of Congress in 1972 after the National Organization for Women protested outside the United States Senate. Some people opposed it because women were already becoming equal in most areas, and women did not want to be drafted into the Vietnam War. Though 35 states ratified it, the amendment did not pass (38 were needed). Most of the states that did not ratify it were in the Southern United States, which is the most conservative and religious part of the country.\nTwenty-one states have a version of the ERA in their state constitutions. Sixteen of those states ratified the federal ERA. Five did not.\nThe ERA was introduced into Congress each year from 1923 to 1972. It has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982.

It is found worldwide.\nThis genus is responsible for approximately 95% of the fatalities resulting from mushroom poisoning, with the death cap accounting for about 50% on its own. The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is amanitin, of which at least eight versions are known.\nFly agaric.\nAmanita muscaria, commonly known as the \"fly agaric\", is a psychoactive fungus. It is known as the fly agaric for its ability to kill houseflies when combined with milk. The reason for this is that flies are attracted to the milk because it is so sweet. When they drink the milk they feel the effects of the mushroom and begin to get intoxicated.\nDeath cap.\nAmanita phalloides, commonly known as the \"death cap\", is a deadly poisonous fungus, one of many in the genus \"Amanita\". Widely distributed across Europe, \"A. phalloides\" forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, death cap has been accidentally introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in color, with a white stipe (stem) and gills (underneath the cap).\nOne mushroom, if eaten, may destroy the liver and cause death. There is no antidote.p211\nToxins.\nTheir major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis, and hence cell metabolism, grind to a halt and the cell dies.\nThe liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible.p217 The RNA polymerase of \"Amanita phalloides\" is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself."}

In 2008, he was named as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.\nHe worked as a model.\nEarly life.\nDorsey was born Jack Patrick Dorsey in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Tim and Marcia (n\u00e9e Smith) Dorsey. He is of English, Irish, and Italian descent. His father worked for a company that developed mass spectrometers and his mother was a homemaker.\nHe was raised Catholic, and his uncle is a Catholic priest in Cincinnati. He attended the Catholic Bishop DuBourg High School. In his younger days, Dorsey worked occasionally as a fashion model.\nBy age fourteen, Dorsey had become interested in dispatch routing. Some of the open-source software he created in the area of dispatch logistics is still used by taxicab companies. Dorsey attended the University of Missouri\u2013Rolla for two-plus years (1995\u201397) before transferring to New York University, but he dropped out in 1999, one semester short of graduating. He came up with the idea that he developed as Twitter while studying at NYU.\nCareer.\nWhile working on dispatching as a programmer, Dorsey moved to California. In 2000, Dorsey started his company in Oakland to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web. His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a \"frictionless service market\". In July 2000, building on dispatching and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.\nWhen he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared easily among friends. He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging. Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status-message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks. The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams, a co-founder of that firm in 2005 who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger."}

He produced many paintings, illustrations, advertisements, and designs.\nMucha moved to Paris in 1887, continued his studies, and worked at producing magazine and advertising illustrations.\nAround Christmas 1894, Mucha happened to drop into a print shop where there was a sudden and unexpected need for a new advertising poster for a play starring Sarah Bernhardt, the most famous actress in Paris. Mucha volunteered to produce a lithographed poster within two weeks, and on 1 January 1895, the advertisement for the play \"Gismonda\" by Victorien Sardou appeared on the streets of the city. It was an overnight sensation and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris. Bernhardt was so satisfied with the success of this first poster that she entered into a 6-year contract with Mucha.\nMucha produced a flurry of paintings, posters, advertisements, and book illustrations, as well as designs for jewellery, carpets, wallpaper, and theatre sets in what was initially called the \"Mucha Style\" but became known as \"Art Nouveau\" (French for 'new art'). Mucha's works frequently featured beautiful, strong young women in flowing vaguely Neoclassical looking robes, often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed halos behind the women's heads.\nIn contrast with contemporary poster makers he used pale pastel colours.\nThe 1900 Paris Exhibition spread the \"Mucha style\" abroad, of which Mucha said \"I think [the Exposition Universelle] made some contribution toward bringing aesthetic values into arts and crafts.\"\nHe decorated the Bosnia and Herzegovina Pavilion and collaborated in the Austrian Pavilion.\nMucha's Art Nouveau style was often imitated. The Art Nouveau style however, was one that Mucha attempted to distance himself from. He always insisted that his paintings came purely from within and from Czech art. He declared that art existed only to communicate a spiritual message, and nothing more. He was frustrated at the fame he gained through commercial art, when he most wanted to concentrate on more lofty projects that would ennoble art and his birthplace."}

Many times the potassium is dissolved in liquid ammonia. It can also be made by reacting potassium sulfate with carbon. It is made when black powder is burned."}

Schoephoester in 1928. Schoephoester produced and sold the ice cream in his grocery store. By 1937 Schoep's Ice Cream had become well known locally and E. B. Schoephoester sold his company to Peter B. Thomsen, a butter maker. The company has been kept in the Thomsen family, and as of 2008 it was owned in part by nineteen members of the Thomsen family.\nOperation.\nAll of Schoep's Ice Cream is currently produced from a single factory located on Helena Street in Madison, Wisconsin. As of 2008 Schoep's was producing 6,000 gallons of ice cream an hour and 2.5 million gallons a year. With this high production rate, Schoep's has been recognized as the top producer of ice cream in the state of Wisconsin. Due to this growth, in 2005, Schoep's opened a $7 million, 46,000-square-foot distribution center on Manufacturers Drive, near the Dane County Regional Airport. This new facility features space for 3,600 pallets and 14 loading-dock doors. Before this facility was built, Schoep's had shipped all of their ice cream from two loading docks at their factory.\nContracts.\nWalgreens.\nSchoep's is not well known around the United States as Schoep's Ice Cream, but as Walgreens brand Ice Cream. Since 1993 Schoep's has been the sole producer of ice cream sold under the Walgreens label. This contract accounts for more than 25 percent of Schoep's business."}

These dates usually contain the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nActivity.\nThe number of storms this season was slightly above average. There were eight tropical storms, and six hurricanes. However, the number of major hurricanes was below average with three.\nHurricane Agatha.\nOn May 22, a tropical depression (a large and organized cloud mass) formed. It took a rare southeast track. On May 24, the depression made a lope strengthened into Tropical Storm Agatha. Agatha headed almost due north. On May 25, reached minimal hurricane strength and turned to the east-southeast. Agatha weakened back to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it continued paralleling the coast of Mexico. Agatha restrengthened into a tropical storm for 12 hours on May 28 and 29 before dissipating for good that same day.\nHurricane Estelle.\nAt midday on July 16, a tropical depression formed. It acquired gale-force winds 12 hours later and was named Estelle. On July 18, it intensified into a hurricane. In an environment that favored an increase of the storm's winds, Estelle continued strengthening, and became the first major hurricane of the season on July 20. Estelle's forward motion increased to close to 20 knots. Estelle's path took it towards a potential landfall on the Big Island. Due to a shearing environment from a trough, Estelle weakened as it continued approaching Hawaii. A possible recurve never materialized, and the cyclone continued its path towards the Hawaiian Islands.\nThe hurricane veered to west and passed south of the islands. Estelle weakened to a tropical storm on July 23. Early on July 25, Tropical Storm Estelle weakened to a depression. The tropical cyclone weakened two days later.\nDue to its rapid motion, Estelle kept pace with a large swell of water that it generated. In combination with a high spring tide and peripheral winds generated by Estelle, huge waves crashed on the shores of the Big Island on the afternoon of July 22. The high waves washed away five beachfront homes and severely damaged dozens of others in Vacation Land. The total damage was around 2 million (1986 USD) dollars. On Maui, waves washed away a dirt road on the eastern part of the island between Kipahulu and Kaupo.\nAfter Estelle passed by the islands, moisture related to the tropical cyclone caused heavy rainfall in the Ka'u and Puna districts on the Big Island. After Estelle dissipated, its moisture continued to spread over the islands, causing significant rainfall and thunderstorms over the archipelago. The only deaths reported were two drownings on Oahu that occurred on July 23. \nHurricane Paine.\nA cloud mass became a tropical depression late on the September 27 roughly 200 miles southwest of Guatemala. Paralleling the Mexican coastline, the system became a tropical storm late on the 29th, about 350 miles west-southwest of Acapulco. It steadily intensified, peaking with winds of 100\u00a0mph. This made Paine a Category 2 hurricane, Paine entered the Gulf of California on the evening of October 1. The hurricane increased its motion, crossing the coast near San Jose (Boca del Rio) while still a hurricane. The system moved rapidly across Mexico, bringing significant rains from west Texas across Oklahoma and Kansas into the Mid-Mississippi Valley. Flooding was reported, with the worst flood begin near Oklahoma City, the capital of the US State of Oklahoma.\nHurricane Roslyn.\nThe next tropical cyclone originated as a tropical disturbance which moved westward offshore\nNicaragua. During the early afternoon of the 15th, ship reports indicated the formation of a tropical depression near 10.2N 92.7W. The cyclone moved at a quick pace to the west- northwest south of a warm-core ridge. Early on the morning of the 16th, Roslyn became a tropical storm. By the morning of the October 17, it had developed into a hurricane south of Acapulco.\nRoslyn began to recurve within a few hundred miles of Manzanillo. Striking Mazatl\u00e1n as a marginal hurricane on the 20th, the remains of the system caused heavy rains along the Middle Texas coast. It later moved northward through the Mississippi Valley, spreading light to moderate rains \nalong its path and then started to spread rains across the Southern United States. Click here for the storm total rainfall graphic for Roslyn.\nTropical Storm Georgette.\nOn August 3, a tropical depression organized in the open ocean. Twelve hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Georgette before weakening to a depression 6 hours later. It then accelerated to a very rapid speed of 20-39 knots. Due to its fast speed, Georgette could not maintain a closed circulation, and the tropical storm degenerated into a non-cyclonic disturbance. The disturbance kept up its rapid forward motion, crossed the dateline, and entered the western Pacific.\nFive days later, Georgette reformed into a depression in the western part of the Pacific Ocean. As was customary, it kept its name. It eventually strengthened into a minimal typhoon (a hurricane in the West Pacific). It began to interact with a typohoon in the west Pacific, and thus cased it to dissipate.\n1986 storm names.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1986. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1992 season. This is the same list used for the 1980 season. Storms were named Orlene, Paine, and Roslyn for the first time in 1986, although Orlene had been used on the old four-year lists. No central Pacific names were used; the first name used would have been Oka. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray."}

It officially started on May 15, 1985 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1985 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1985. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nAt the time, the 1985 season was the most active on record in the eastern north Pacific (breaking a short-lived record set in 1983), with 25 tropical cyclones forming. Of those, 22 attained tropical storm intensity, 12 reaching hurricane intensity and 8 becoming major hurricanes by reaching Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. In addition, three additional systems formed in the central north Pacific, of which one became a hurricane and another became a typhoon before re-crossing the international dateline.\nDespite the activity, there were few notable systems this year. The only cyclone to make landfall was Hurricane Waldo, which caused damage in Mexico. Elsewhere, surf from Hurricane Pauline caused damage in Hawaii and either Pauline or the following system sank a sailing vessel.\nNotable storms.\nHurricane Pauline.\nHurricane Pauline caused heavy surf along the Big Island, which washed debris up onto roads. There was no damage reported. It threatened the islands enough to prompt a hurricane watch, which means winds of 74\u00a0mph or higher are possible during the next 36 hours. However, the hurricane turned away.\nHurricane Rick.\nRick was the strongest storm of the season, and at the time had the second strongest winds recorded in a tropical cyclone in the Central Pacific. It may also have contributed to the sailing vessel being overdue.\nHurricane Terry.\nTerry was a powerful major hurricane that formed by the 15th of September. It became a major hurricane fours days later on the 19th, but it did not affect land while doing so. It eventually dissipated due to hostile conditions on the 24th, without ever impacting land.\nHurricane Waldo.\nTropical Depression Twenty Three-E formed from a disturbance on October 7. In an environment over warm waters (86\u00a0\u00b0F), it rapidly intensified, reaching Tropical Storm intensity the same day it formed. Waldo moved towards the Mexican coast. Just after peaking as a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the hurricane scale, Waldo made landfall southwest of Culiac\u00e1n. Waldo rapidly dissipated over land. Major damage, but no deaths were reported in Mexico. It was the season's lone landfall.\nHurricane Xina.\nThe first recorded twenty-second storm of a season formed October 25. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Xina early October 27. Xina began to start tracing out a huge oblong loop beneath an anticyclone. Xina peaked as a minimal major hurricane on October 29. As it finished the loop and left the cover of the anticyclone, Xina started falling apart. Cool waters took their toll on the cyclone, and Xina dissipated on November 5.\nHad the list of names not been extended, Xina would have been named \"Alpha\" instead. However, the anticipated exhaustion of the old list was averted, meaning that the east Pacific has never exhausted its list. Xina stayed at sea, and no casualties or damages were reported.\n1985 storm names.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1985. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1991 season. The name \"Dolores\" was misspelled as \"Delores\" in 1991. This is the same list used for the 1979 season, except for the added names. Storms were named Kevin, Linda, Marty, Nora, Olaf, Pauline, Rick, Sandra, Terry, Vivian, Waldo, and Xina for the first time in 1985. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.\nOne name from the Central Pacific list was used \u2013 Nele. It was the first usage for this name. One storm, Typhoon Skip, formed in the central Pacific but did not receive a name until it reached the west Pacific, therefore only Nele was used from the central Pacific list.\nLater during the '80s, the added names were made a permanent part of the Eastern Pacific lists, and other names were added for even-numbered years.\nHad the names not been added, this season would have been the first Pacific or Atlantic hurricane season to exceed the list, and had to have used a Greek letter named storm. This would not occur until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, which saw an unprecedented 28 storms and 6 Greek names."}

Some crystals fit more atoms in them than others, and these crystals usually weigh more."}

It was produced by Walden Media and Buena Vista Pictures. Cameron worked with NASA scientists to explore the Mid-Ocean Ridges, under water chains of mountains in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that are home to some of the planet's more unusual forms of life.\nPlot.\nCameron joins up aboard the Russian research ship, \"Akademik Mstislav Keldysh\", with a group of NASA scientists, as well as some Russian marine biologists, to investigate ten hydrothermal vents in both the Atlantic and Pacific. The vents have their own unique ecosystem, which support diverse organisms such as giant tube worms, swarms of blind white crabs, and vast amounts of shrimp which are capable of \"seeing\" water that is heated by the vents. These creatures do not need sunlight like other organisms, and instead get their energy from the vents. They are able to survive in the superheated and sulfurous water. Because of this, the documentary suggests that this is what life beyond Earth might look like. As some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem, these exotic vents provide an insight into some of the forms that alien life might take.\nThe documentary shows Cameron's passion for exploring the oceans, as well as his interest in extraterrestrial life. It also shows the technology used to reach such depths.\nThe movie is similar to Cameron's earlier documentary, \"Ghosts of the Abyss\" (2003), which involves him journeying to the wreck of the RMS \"Titanic\". It too was filmed in the 3-D IMAX format."}

Garhwal's name is taken from Garhs (or forts). This is because this region had 52 forts belonging to local chiefs who ruled small areas near their forts. People who belong to this region are known as Gharhwalis. Now, this region is being looked onto as a tourist hub of India. This land has the districts Tehri, Chamoli, Uttrakashi, Pauri, some parts of Dehradun, and other areas. \nHistory.\nThe history of Garhwal goes back to the dawn of Hindu civilization, but most of history of Garhwal is fairly unknown or not given any importance by historians. Also, some facts known about this land are vague and taken from Garhwali folk songs and Hindu epics. Most historians say that the name of Garhwal comes from the ancient regimes and rulers. However, most of the facts are unknown, and the things that \"are\" known are very vague and unreliable.\nMARODA is a very Important village of Pauri District. It is only from Devpryag which is a holy place for Hindus as it is the starting point of the Holy river Ganga. Though the inhabitants of Maroda are well settlled in Delhi for their studies and Jobs but still they are very deeply attached with this village and the tradition and culture of the uttarakhand.\nReligious Aspect.\nGarhwal is mostly known as the land of sacred Devi Devta (gods) because the holy river Ganges, Yamuna comes from here and Char Dhams (Holy Pilgrimage) Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and yamunotri are found here along with Panch Paryags (Lands where merging of Holy Rivers take place). These Paryags are Deoparyag, Rudraparyag, Karanparyag, Nandparyag and Vishnuparyag. There are also some Shaktipeeths like Dhari Devi, Mathiyana, Kunjapuri, Surkunda and Punch Badri Kedarnath, Madhya Maheswer, Tungh Nath, Rudra Nath, Kalpeshwer and Panch Badri Adi Badri, Vridha Badri, Bhavisya Badri, Yog Badri, Badri Vishal.\nPeople.\nGarhwal is motherland of most of Gharwali people and language spoken by Garhwalis is also known as Garhwali. Most of the Garwalis are villagers and depends upon agriculture.Village in Garhwal are combine among some areas which is known as \"Patti\" for example Patti Bhillang may contain more than 30 villages. Garhwal land is facing troubles of unemployment and therefore most Garhwali youngsters migrate to the cities. Administration for education is fairly poor however some improvements are there but not so impressive as other states.Health and medical services need to be improved and cultivation is totally depends upon rain and rainfall is not consistent.\nCulture.\nThe culture and dialect of Garhwal is different in different areas. The culture and dialect of one area can be different from another area but an important part of the culture is Hinduism. Hinduism is the soul of Garhwali culture. Garhwali culture is influenced a lot by Epics and Devi Devta."}

Some dishes use them like egg salad. They can be stored for a long time in the refrigerator. Some machines called egg slicers can slice these easily.\nSoft-boiled eggs.\nSoft-boiled eggs have firmly cooked eggwhites, while at the same time, the yolks are liquid. They can have salmonella in them if you don't prepare them correctly. In Europe, soft-boiled eggs are a traditional breakfast cousin, and you normally scoop them out of the shell and eat. In Asia, the soft-boiled egg is cracked into a cup with soy sauce and black pepper.\nTo make the perfect soft boiled egg, bring the water up to a boil, then lower it to a rapid simmer. Add the eggs to the pot, and then begin timing.

The four emperors were Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian.\nThe suicide of emperor Nero, in 68, was followed by a brief period of civil war, the first Roman civil war since Mark Antony's death in 30 BC. Between June of 68 and December of 69, Rome witnessed the successive rise and fall of Galba, Otho and Vitellius until the final accession of Vespasian, the first ruler of the Flavian Dynasty.\nThis was an example of the political disturbances which occurred in the history of the Roman Empire. The military and political anarchy created by this civil war had serious repercussions, such as the outbreak of the Batavian rebellion. The Jewish Revolt was already ongoing.\nThe succession.\nNero to Galba.\nBy June of 68, the Senate took the initiative to rid itself of Nero, declaring him a public enemy and Galba emperor. The Praetorian Guard were bribed to betray Nero, and Nero committed suicide. Galba was recognized as emperor and welcomed into the city at the head of his legions\nGalba did not remain popular for long. On his march to Rome, he either destroyed or took enormous fines from towns that did not accept him immediately. In Rome, Galba cancelled all the reforms of Nero, including benefits for many important persons. The army was not happy either. After his safe arrival in Rome, Galba refused to pay the rewards he had promised to soldiers who had supported him. The Roman treasury was indeed in a bad way after Nero's extravagances, but Galba did not handle the situation well.\nLike Nero, Galba had a fear of conspirators and executed many senators and equites without trial. Moreover, in the start of the civil year of 69 on January 1, the legions of Germania Inferior refused to swear allegiance and obedience to the new emperor. On the following day, the legions acclaimed Vitellius, their governor, as emperor.\nMarcus Salvius Otho bribed the Praetorian Guard, already very unhappy with the emperor, to his side. When Galba heard about the \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" he went to the streets in an attempt to normalize the situation. It proved a mistake, because he could attract no supporters. Shortly afterwards, the Praetorian Guard killed him in the Forum.\nOtho to Vitellius.\nOtho was recognized as emperor by the Senate that same day. The new emperor was saluted with relief. Although ambitious and greedy, Otho did not have a record for tyranny or cruelty and was expected to be a fair emperor. However, trouble in the form of Vitellius was marching down on Italy from Germany.\nVitellius had behind him the finest elite legions of the empire, composed of veterans of the Germanic Wars. These would prove to be his best arguments to gain power. Otho was not keen to begin another civil war and sent emissaries to propose a peace and inviting Vitellius to be his son-in-law. It was too late to reason; Vitellius' generals had half of his army heading to Italy. After a series of minor victories, Otho was defeated in the Battle of Bedriacum. Rather than flee and attempt a counter-attack, Otho decided to put an end to the anarchy and committed suicide. He had been emperor for a little more than three months.\nVitellius to Vespasian.\nOn the news of Otho's suicide, Vitellius was recognised as emperor by the Senate. Given this recognition, Vitellius set out for Rome. He faced problems from the start of his reign. The city was left very skeptical when Vitellius chose a day of bad auspices (according to Roman superstition) to accept the office of \"Pontifex Maximus\".\nEvents would seemingly prove them right. With the throne tightly secured, Vitellius engaged in a series of feasts, banquets and triumphal parades that drove the imperial treasury close to bankruptcy. Debts were quickly accrued and money-lenders started to demand repayment. \nVitellius showed his violent nature by ordering the torture and execution of those who dared to make such demands. Vitellius took the step of killing citizens who named him as their heir, often together with any co-heirs. Moreover, he engaged in a pursuit of every possible rival, inviting them to the palace with promises of power only to have them assassinated.\nVespasian had been given a special command in Judaea by Nero in 67 with the task of putting down the Great Jewish Revolt. He gained the support of the governor of Syria, Gaius Licinius Mucianus. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus. Vespasian himself travelled to Alexandria where he had been acclaimed Emperor on July 1, thereby gaining control of the vital grain supplies from Egypt. Vespasian's son Titus remained in Judaea to deal with the Jewish rebellion. Before the eastern legions could reach Rome, the Danubian legions of the provinces of Raetia and Moesia also acclaimed Vespasian as Emperor in August, and led by Marcus Antonius Primus invaded Italy. In October, the forces led by Primus won a crushing victory over Vitellius' army at the Second Battle of Bedriacum.\nSurrounded by enemies, Vitellius made a last attempt to win the city to his side, distributing bribes and promises of power where needed. The Danube army was now very near Rome. Vitellius went into hiding and prepared to flee, but decided on a last visit to the palace. There he was caught by Vespasian's men and killed. In seizing the capital, they burned down the temple of Jupiter.\nThe Senate acknowledged Vespasian as emperor on the following day. It was 21 December 69, the year that had begun with Galba on the throne."}

She became Lula's Chief of Staff in 2005, after her predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, resigned because of charges of corruption. On 31 October 2010, Rousseff won 55% of the vote. Her main contender was Jos\u00e9 Serra who won 44%. Serra was the candidate of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party. On 1 January 2011, she became the first woman president of the country. In August 2016, she was impeached and removed from office.\nEarly career.\nShe was against the military dictatorship that governed Brazil from 1964 to 1985. In January 1970 she was sent to prison for being a member of a Marxist group which had carried out bank robberies and murders. She was released after three years. She joined the Workers Party in 1986.\nPresidency.\nRousseff was an important ally of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a labour activist who became President of Brazil. A left wing candidate, Lula was a popular president and Rousseff became his chosen successor. She won the 2010 Presidential election.\nAs President, Rousseff kept with many of Lula's policies. She also became known for bringing the World Cup and the Olympics to Brazil. Many Brazilians were against this, and felt that the money spent on these events would be better spent on other things. Rousseff was on the board of Petrobras, an oil company, in the 2000s. In 2015, reports of corruption at Petrobras became known. Although not named in the investigation, many people in her government were, and there were large protests against Rousseff's government, including Lula da Silva.

On 3 December 2015, impeachment proceedings against Rousseff were officially approved by the Chamber of Deputies.\nImpeachment.\nOn 12 May 2016, the impeachment process began when the Senate of Brazil temporarily suspended President Rousseff's powers and duties for up to six months or until the Senate reaches a verdict: to remove her from office if found guilty or to acquit her from the crimes charged. Vice President Michel Temer assumed her powers and duties as Acting President of Brazil during the suspension. Rousseff said she is innocent and that the impeachment is a coup. Rousseff was removed from office on 31 August 2016 when the Brazilian Senate voted 61-20 in favor of impeachment. She was succeeded by Vice President Michel Temer."}

SD is an abbreviation of Secure Digital, and microSD cards are sometimes referred to as \u00b5SD or uSD. The cards are used in mobile phones and other mobile devices.\nIt is the smallest memory card that can be bought; at 15\u00a0mm \u00d7 11\u00a0mm \u00d7 1\u00a0mm (about the size of a fingernail), it is about a quarter of the size of a normal-sized SD card. There are adapters that make the small microSD able to fit in devices that have slots for standard SD, miniSD, Memory Stick Duo card, and even USB. But, not all of the different cards can work together. Many microSD cards are sold with a standard SD adapter, so that people can use them in devices that take standard SD but not microSD cards.\nTransFlash and microSD cards are the same (they can be used in place of each other), but microSD has support for SDIO mode. This lets microSD slots support non-memory jobs like Bluetooth, GPS, and Near Field Communication by attaching a device in place of a memory card.\nMicroSDHC format is a newer version of the MicroSD which is not backwards compatible. Some older devices cannot use the newer format, although third party firmware is available for some devices.\nTransFlash cards are sold in 16MB and 32MB sizes. microSD cards are sold in many sizes, from 64 MB to 32 GB, while microSDHC cards are sold in sizes between 4 GB to 64 GB. Larger ones are microSDXC memory cards, sold in sizes between 8 GB and 1 TB.\nHistory.\nThe microSD format was made by the company SanDisk. It was first called T-Flash, and then TransFlash, before being named microSD when it started to be used by the SD Card Association (SDA). Other flash card formats approved by the SDA include miniSD and standard SD card.\nThe SDA announced the microSD format at CTIA Wireless 2005 on March 14, 2005, and the final microSD details were announced on July 13, 2005. When they were first sold, the microSD format was sold in sizes of 32, 64, and 128 MB. SanDisk made a 4 GB microSD card in July 2006, at first costing $99 (USD). Since then, the prices for flash memory devices have become much lower. At the time of April 2009, the same 4 GB card could be bought for as low as $12 (USD) at department stores, and by May 2009, for as low as $6 (USD) at online electronics stores. In January 2010, a 16 GB micro SD card class 2 cost about $40 (USD), and a 4 GB class 2 micro SD card about $8 (USD).\nIn February 2014, SanDisk announced a new microSD card, the MicroSDXC. At the time, the cards held up to 128GB. To enable this amount of storage capacity on a removable microSD card, SanDisk developed a proprietary technique that allows for 16 memory die to be vertically stacked, each shaved to be thinner than a strand of hair. At the time of their release, these cards had capacities ranging from 8GB to 128GB, with the prices ranging from $29.99 to $199.99.\nPower Usage.\nSeveral manufacturers make microSD cards and they consume different amounts of electrical power. Most are in the range of 0-100\u00a0mA at a supply voltage of 3.3\u00a0V. TwinMOS Technologies Midde East FZE says that the cards carry a maximum of 45\u00a0mA during transfer. Toshiba lists 80-100\u00a0mA."}

A member of the Flavian dynasty, Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death.\nMilitary service.\nBefore becoming emperor, Titus gained renown as a military commander. He served as a military tribune in Germany and Roman Britain.\nIt was he who brought the reinforcements after the revolt of Boudicca. Two tribes had destroyed Colchester, London and St Albans, and wiped out a whole legion, but were finally defeated by the Roman governor of Britain.\nJudaea.\nHe served under his father in Judaea during the First Jewish-Roman War (66\u201370), where he commanded a legion. The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor Nero in 68, but soon continued in the Year of the Four Emperors.\nWhen Vespasian was declared emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he successfully laid siege to Jerusalem. He destroyed the city and Temple in Jerusalem. For this, Titus was awarded a Roman triumph. To this day, the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory circa AD 70.\nRome.\nWhen Vespasian became Emperor, Titus and his brother Domitian received the title of \"Caesar\" from the Senate. Titus held seven Roman consulships during Vespasian's reign and acted as his secretary, appearing in the Senate on his behalf.\nUnder the rule of his father, Titus gained notoriety in Rome as a ruthless Prefect of the Praetorian Guard.\nBerenice.\nDuring the Jewish wars, Titus had begun a love affair with Berenice, sister of Agrippa II. The Herodians had collaborated with the Romans during the rebellion, and Berenice herself had supported Vespasian upon his campaign to become emperor.\nIn 75, she returned to Titus and openly lived with him in the palace as his promised wife. The Romans were wary of her, and disapproved of their relationship. When the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre, Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away, but his reputation suffered.\nEmperor.\nTitus ruled to great acclaim after the death of Vespasian in 79. He was considered a good emperor by Suetonius and other contemporary historians.\nAs emperor, he is best known for completing the Colosseum and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters, the Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 and a fire in Rome in 80.\nBecause of his supposed vices, many Romans feared he would be another Nero. But Titus proved to be an effective emperor and was well-loved when people found that he had virtues instead of vices. One of his first acts as an emperor was to stop trials based on treason charges, which had long plagued Rome.\nUnder Augustus, the law of treason had been revived and applied to cover slander and libel. This led to a long cycle of trials and executions under such emperors as Tiberius, Caligula and Nero. This spawned entire networks of informers who terrorized Rome for decades. Titus put an end to this practice, against himself or anyone else, declaring:\n\"It is impossible for me to be insulted or abused in any way. For I do naught that deserves censure, and I care not for what is reported falsely\".\nConsequently, no senators were put to death during his reign; he thus kept to his promise that he would assume the office of Pontifex Maximus \"for the purpose of keeping his hands unstained\". The informers were publicly punished and banished from the city. Titus then made it unlawful for persons to be tried under different laws for the same offense (double jeopardy|). Finally, when Berenice returned to Rome, he sent her away.\nAfter barely two years in office, Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81. He was deified (declared a god) by the Roman Senate and succeeded by his younger brother Domitian."}

On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate. As the new ruler of the Roman Empire, he vowed to restore liberties which had been cut during the autocratic government of Domitian.\nNerva's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army.\nA revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 caused him to adopt an heir. After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan, a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva died of natural causes.\nAlthough much of his life remains obscure, Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. Recent historians have revised this assessment, characterizing Nerva as a well-intentioned but ultimately weak ruler, whose reign brought the Roman Empire to the brink of civil war.\nNerva's greatest success was his choice of Trajan.

It is not used in any standard textbook on evolution.\nIt is the incorrect idea that the adaptation of an individual animal works in such a way that an entire species dies out. The idea is that evolution makes plants and animals pass on their genes to the next generation more efficiently, but it does not guarantee the survival of the population or the species. Obviously, that is true, and extinction occurs often. Evolution cannot foresee the future. This is, however, nothing at all to do with suicide.\nA candidate for a future evolutionary suicide might be cod. Cod is caught as fish by humans. The fish do not weigh as much as they used to, mostly because they do not survive long enough. They do, however, mature earlier. Although this means the number of eggs per female fish is reduced, its effect depends rather on the extent of overfishing. Data suggests that when fishing is controlled, cod numbers return to their former level. This was the lesson of World War II, when cod fishing in many areas was greatly reduced, and pre-war cod numbers recovered."}

Jewish people wanted some land to live in together. It did not necessarily have to be the Jewish biblical homeland in the land where the state of Israel is today, and it did not necessarily have to be its own country.\nDevelopment of territorialism.\nBefore 1905, some Zionist leaders were thinking about making places for Jews to call home other than Palestine. Theodor Herzl's \"Der Judenstaat\" argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, \"our ever-memorable historic home\", or Argentina, \"one of the most fertile countries in the world\". (\"Fertile\" means land where it is easy to grow crops.) Many of the socialist Zionist groups were more territorialist than Zionist, such as Nachman Syrkin's Zionist Socialist Workers Party (the Z.S.).\nThe Jewish Colonization Association, started in 1891 by the Baron Maurice de Hirsch, was started to help move many Jews from Russia and other Eastern European countries. It wanted to move them to land where they could grow food and that it would buy. It had in mind land in North and South America (especially Argentina).\nIn 1903, British cabinet ministers suggested the British Uganda Programme, land for a Jewish state in \"Uganda\" (the land they were thinking about is actually in the modern country of Kenya). At first, Herzl said no to the idea, because he liked Palestine better. After the April 1903 Kishinev pogrom, in which many Jews were violently attacked in Russia, Herzl suggested to the Sixth Zionist Congress to look at the offer as a temporary way to keep Russian Jews safe. The plan was very controversial, and many Russian Jews were so upset that they walked out of the meeting. Few historians believe that such a settlement idea could have attracted immigrants, received much money in donations, or been supported by many other countries. Because some members of the Zionist leadership liked the idea, however, peace was kept in the movement because they voted to start a committee to look at the possibility. They did not officially say no to the idea until the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905.\nBecause of this, the Jewish Territorialist Organization (ITO) led by Israel Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement. It tried to find land where Jews could settle in different parts of America (e.g. Galveston), Africa, Asia, and Australia, but with little success. The ITO broke up in 1925. \nApart from the (ITO), within the USSR there was also a Territorialist effort in Ukraine, the Crimea and then in a region around Birobidzhan, where a Jewish Autonomous Region was started in 1934.\nAs the Holocaust became close and as Nazis were discriminating against Jews in Germany, Isaac Nachman Steinberg started the Freeland League in the United States in 1935. This organization tried, but did not succeed, to start a new Jewish country by getting a large piece of land in places in Ecuador, Australia, or Suriname where not many people lived. One of the more well-known tries was the Kimberley Plan, to get land in Australia. After the State of Israel was created in 1948, Steinberg had criticized the exclusivist politics of the Zionist government and continued his attempts to create a non-nationalist Jewish settlement in some other part of the world. After Steinberg died in 1957, the Freeland League was led by Mordkhe Schaechter, who gradually changed the focus of the organization to more cultural, Yiddishist goals."}

In Rome, he built the Pantheon and the Temple of Venus and Roma.\nIn addition to being emperor, Hadrian was a humanist and a lover of Greek culture in all his tastes. Hadrian was the third of the so-called Five Good Emperors.\nHadrian was born to a Hispano-Roman family, probably in Italica (near Seville). His predecessor Trajan was a maternal cousin of Hadrian's father. Trajan never officially designated an heir, but according to his wife Pompeia Plotina, Trajan named Hadrian emperor immediately before his death. Trajan's wife and his friend Licinius Sura were well-disposed towards Hadrian, and he may well have owed his succession to them.\nDuring his reign, Hadrian traveled to nearly every province of the empire. Hadrian sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the empire: he ordered the construction of many temples in the city.\nHadrian spent much of his time with the military. He usually wore military attire, and dined and slept amongst the soldiers. He ordered military training and drilling to be more rigorous and even made use of false reports of attack to keep the army alert. Despite his fondness for the army, there was little military activity throughout the empire while Hadrian reigned. After he became emperor, Hadrian withdrew from Trajan's conquests in Mesopotamia and Armenia, and even considered abandoning Dacia. Late in his reign, he stopped the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea, renaming the province Syria Palaestina.\nIn 136 an ailing Hadrian adopted Lucius Aelius as his heir, but he died suddenly two years later. In 138, Hadrian promised to adopt Antoninus Pius if he would in turn adopt Marcus Aurelius and Aelius' son Lucius Verus as his own eventual successors. Antoninus agreed, and soon afterward Hadrian died at his villa near Tibur."}

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and worked there as a silversmith. He was married twice and became the father of 16 children.\nRevere was a member of a group called The Sons of Liberty. This group wanted better treatment for the American colonies from the British government. Revere made a silver engraving of the Boston Massacre. This engraving made Americans even more angry with the British.\nRevere was a courier and soldier in the American Revolution. After the Revolutionary War, he operated a metal foundry in Boston. He died in Boston, and was buried in the Granary Burying Ground. He is most famous for alerting the colonial militia that British soldiers were coming before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1860, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem about this called \"Paul Revere's Ride.\"\nMidnight Ride.\nRevere is most famous for his \"Midnight Ride\". It happened on the night of April 1819, 1775. British officials had learned that American Patriots (the leaders of the American Revolution) were storing guns in Concord, Massachusetts. They wanted to destroy the guns. The Patriots thought the British also wanted to capture Patriot leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams. The two leaders were staying in Lexington, Massachusetts. Revere and a man named William Dawes rode on horseback from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts to warn Adams and Hancock that the British were coming. Revere warned other Patriots along the way. \nWhen Paul Revere arrived in Lexington, he shouted loudly to wake up and warn the people. Revere was soon joined by Dawes, who also told the people that the British soldiers were coming. In Concord, Samuel Prescott joined Revere and Dawes. All three were stopped by British soldiers in a field in the city of Lincoln, Massachusetts. Prescott and Dawes escaped quickly. However, the British soldiers held Revere for about an hour before letting him go. Because his horse was gone, Revere ran back to Lexington, where the fighting had already begun. Almost a hundred years later, Paul Revere's Ride (poem) revived his fame."}

They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage.Faustina was a beautiful woman, renowned for her wisdom. She spent her whole life caring for the poor and assisting the most disadvantaged Romans.\nFaustina bore Antoninus four children, two sons and two daughters. They included Faustina the Younger, a future Roman Empress, who married her maternal cousin, future Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius.\nWhen Faustina died in 141, Antoninus was greatly bereaved and had a temple built in the Roman Forum in her name, had coins with her portrait struck in her honor, and created a charity called \"Girls of Faustina\", which assisted orphaned girls.\nFavor with Hadrian.\nHaving filled with success the offices of quaestor and praetor, he was consul in 120. He was appointed by Hadrian as one of the four proconsuls to administer Italia, then Asia. The Emperor Hadrian adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138, after the death of his first adopted son Lucius Aelius. The condition was that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Aelius Verus, who afterwards became the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus\nEmperor.\nThere are no records of any military related acts in his time. One modern scholar has written \"It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see, let alone command, a Roman army, but that, throughout the twenty-three years of his reign, he never went within five hundred miles of a legion\". His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the Principate.\nUnrest in Britannia is believed to have led to the construction of the Antonine Wall from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde, although it was soon abandoned.\nHe was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with crises without leaving Italy once during his reign. He dealt with provincial matters through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed). This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.\nThose twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after his reign. We might think that he wisely cut the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum. Perhaps he was uninterested in events away from Rome, and his inaction contributed to the troubles which faced Marcus Aurelius and other emperors of the third century.\nGerman historian Ernst Kornemann, in his \"R\u00f6mische Geschichte\" (roman history) [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954], said that the reign of Antoninus comprised \"a succession of grossly wasted opportunities\", given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing. Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders.\nAfter the longest reign since Augustus (surpassing Tiberius by a couple of months), Antoninus died of fever about twelve miles (19\u00a0km) from Rome, on 7 March 161. The last word that he uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the password was \"aequanimitas\" (equanimity)."}

Antoninus was adopted by Hadrian on the condition that Verus and Hadrian\u2019s great-nephew Marcus Aurelius was to be adopted by Antoninus as his sons and heirs.\nVerus started his political career as a quaestor in 153, became consul in 154, and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius as his senior partner.\nEmperor.\nAccession of Lucius and Marcus, 161.\nAntoninus died on 7 March 161, and was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius.p156 Although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers.p116 The senate accepted, granting Lucius the \"imperium\", the tribunician power, and the name Augustus. It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors.p117\nIn spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more authority than Verus. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Pius' administration, and he alone was \"Pontifex Maximus\". It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior. As the biographer wrote, \"Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor\".p117\nImmediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors went to the camp of the praetorian guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as \"imperatores\". Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative.p117 The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles.\nWar with Parthia 161\u201366.\nWar with Parthia had started as soon as Antoninus died.\nLucius' journey east, 162\u201363?\nOver the winter of 161\u201362, as more bad news arrived\u2014a rebellion was brewing in Syria\u2014it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity.p123 Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \"demanded the presence of an emperor\".\nFurius Victorinus, one of the two praetorian prefects, was sent with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, and part of the praetorian guard.p125 Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia, giving him some experience with eastern affairs. Since a prefect had to accompany the guard, Victorinus was the clear choice.p161\nLaelianus, one of the Senators, was \"a serious man and an old-fashioned disciplinarian\". Bassus, the other Senator, had been governor of Lower Moesia, and was also made \"comes\".p125\nLucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium; Marcus followed him as far as Capua. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa, probably afflicted with a mild stroke, and took to bed. Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried south to see him.p125\nVerus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens, accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress. It is not known how long Verus' journey east took; he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 162. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.p126\nAntioch 162?\u201365.\nLucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch. He took up a mistress named Panthea, from Smyrna. The biographer calls her a \"low-born girl-friend\",p129 but she is probably closer to an account of Lucian: \"a woman of perfect beauty\", more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles' statues. Polite, caring, humble, she sang to the lyre perfectly and spoke clear Ionic Greek, spiced with Attic wit.p129\nLucius faced quite a task.p162 The Syrian army had turned soft during the east's long peace. They spent more time at the city's open-air caf\u00e9s than in their quarters. Under Lucius, training was stepped up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed. Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp, including the sick bay.p129\nIn the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus' daughter Lucilla.p163 Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father. Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen. Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east. Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception. Lucilla would bear three of Lucius' children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.p163\nCounterattack and victory, 163\u201366.\nLegions I Minervia and V Macedonica, under the legates M. Claudius Fronto and P. Martius Verus, served under Statius Priscus in Armenia, earning success for Roman arms during the campaign season of 163,p163 including the capture of the Armenian capital Artaxata. At the end of the year, Verus took the title \"Armeniacus\", despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year. When Lucius was hailed as \"imperator\" again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the \"Imperator II\" with him. The army of Syria was reinforced by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Gemina's legate Geminius Marcianus.p162\nOccupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. A new king was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, C. Iulius Sohaemus. He may not even have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch, or even Ephesus.p280n Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Verus sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him, saluting the emperor.\nIn 163, while Statius Priscus was occupied in Armenia, the Parthians invaded Osroene, a Roman client state in upper Mesopotamia, just east of Syria, with its capital at Edessa. They deposed the country's leader, Mannus, and replaced him with their own nominee, who would remain in office until 165.p130, 279 In response, Roman forces were moved downstream, to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point. The Parthians still held the southern, Roman bank of the Euphrates (in Syria) as late as 163. Before the end of the year, however, Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern, Parthian bank. Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates, other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia, taking Anthemusia, a town south-west of Edessa. There was little movement in 164; most of the year was spent on preparations for a renewed assault on Parthian territory.p131\nIn 165, Roman forces, perhaps led by Martius Verus and the V Macedonica, moved on Mesopotamia. Edessa was re-occupied, Mannus re-installed.p169 His coinage resumed, too: 'Ma'nu the king' (Syriac: M'NW MLK') or Antonine dynasts on the obverse, and 'King Mannos, friend of Romans' (Greek: \"Basileus Mannos Philor\u014dmaios\") on the reverse. The Parthians retreated to Nisibis, but this too was besieged and captured. The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris; their general Chosrhoes swam down the river and made his hideout in a cave. A second force, under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica, moved down the Euphrates, and fought a major battle at Dura.p163\nBy the end of the year, Cassius' army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The citizens of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid empire, one of Alexander the Great's successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first. Whatever the case, the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucia's long decline.p163/4\nCassius' army, although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely. Iunius Maximus, a young tribune serving in III Gallica under Cassius, took the news of the victory to Rome. Maximus received a generous cash bounty for bringing the good news, and immediate promotion to the quaestorship.p164 Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as \"imperatores\" again, earning the title 'imp. III'.\nCassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Medea. Lucius took the title 'Medicus', and the emperors were again hailed as \"imperatores\", becoming 'imp. IV' in imperial titulature. Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.p164\nMost of the credit for the war's success must be ascribed to subordinate generals. The forces that advanced on Osroene were led by M. Claudius Fronto, an Asian provincial of Greek descent who had led I Minervia in Armenia under Priscus. He was probably the first senator in his family.p130 Fronto was consul for 165, probably in honor of the capture of Edessa. P. Martius Verus had led V Macedonica to the front, and also served under Priscus. Martius Verus was a westerner, whose \"patria\" was perhaps Tolosa in Gallia Narbonensis.\nThe most prominent general, however, was C. Avidius Cassius, commander of III Gallica, one of the Syrian legions. Cassius was young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus. His father, Heliodorus, had not been a senator, but was nonetheless a man of some standing: he had been Hadrian's \"ab epistulis\", followed the emperor on his travels, and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrian's reign. Cassius also, with no small sense of self-worth, claimed descent from the Seleucid kings. Cassius and Martius Verus, still probably in their mid-thirties, took the consulships for 166.p164\nVologases IV of Parthia (147\u2013191) made peace but was forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans. Lucius is reported to have been an excellent commander, without fear of delegating military tasks to more competent generals.\nOn his return to Rome, Lucius was awarded with a triumph. The parade was unusual because it included Lucius, Marcus Aurelius, their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration. Marcus Aurelius' two sons, Commodus five years old and Annius Verus of three, were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion.\nWars on the Danube and death.\nIn the spring of 168 war broke out in the Danubian border when the Marcomanni invaded the Roman territory. This war would last until 180, but Verus did not see the end of it. In 168, as Verus and Marcus Aurelius returned to Rome from the field, Verus fell ill with symptoms attributed to food poisoning, dying after a few days (169). However, scholars believe that Verus may have been a victim of smallpox, as he died during a widespread epidemic known as the Antonine Plague. Despite the minor differences between them, Marcus Aurelius grieved the loss of his adoptive brother. He accompanied the body to Rome, where he offered games to honour his memory."}

{"id": "269951", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=269951", "title": "Cash register", "text": "A cash register, or till, is a machine that holds money. Cash registers are usually found in shops and restaurants. They are used to calculate how much a customer has to pay for something, such as a good or service. The drawer of the cash register, which contains the money, is designed so that it would only open if somebody is buying something. This is to try to stop the customer from stealing money from the employees.\nHistory and types.\nThe person who invented the cash register was James Ritty, who came from Ohio and owned a bar in Dayton. In 1878, he found out that the people who worked in the bar kept on stealing money. When he noticed a part of a ship which counted how many times the propeller turned, he used the same idea to build a machine that could count different amount of sales. He got a patent on his machine and started a company the next year to make them, but it was not popular and the company, which became the National Cash Register Company in 1884, was sold to John H. Patterson.\nAlthough the first cash registers were completely mechanical (they used moving parts such as gears and pulleys), and later ones were powered by electricity, today's cash registers use electronics. Computer chips are used to add up the prices of different items, show the total amount that has to be paid as well as the change that has to be given back to the customer, open the cash drawer after the customer has paid, and print a receipt as a proof of purchase.\nToday, there is software that runs on personal computers that does the same thing as a cash register. This is called a point of sale (POS) system and is used by many big stores and restaurants because it is easier to manage a lot of machines from one place. It can also take care of inventory (how much of each item is in the store at any time), so that the shop owner knows when they have to get more items from the supplier to make sure a customer can get the item when they want it. Unlike a traditional cash register, different parts of a POS system are separate hardware rather than built into one machine, which makes it easier to set up. Companies like IBM, Toshiba, and NCR Corporation (which came from the original National Cash Register Company) are just a few of those that make POS systems and hardware, some of which include touchscreens that make it easy to operate.\nCashiers and payment.\nA cashier is the name of a person who works at the cash register or POS terminal of a retail store, sometimes called the \"checkout\" or \"till\". Customers bring any merchandise they wish to buy to the cashier, who will then enter each item into the cash register. In the past, the cashier had to press some keys on a keyboard to do this, but in recent days he or she simply scans a barcode on the product itself using a laser scanner. The cash register then looks up the item in a database stored in a computer to get its price, and add it to the customer's purchase.\nIn some types of stores, such as grocery stores, items are sold by weight. In this case, the cashier has to put the item on a weighing scale, which would then send the weight of the item to the cash register to calculate its price. Many stores use a system of code numbers, called price look-up (PLU) codes, to identify the item being weighed and sold. These code numbers have become a standard used around the world.\nAfter the cashier has scanned all of the goods, he or she will ask the customer for payment. If the customer is paying by cash, the customer gives the cashier money, which the cashier will count to find out how much the customer is paying. He or she will then enter the amount into the cash register, which will open the cash drawer. Inside the drawer, there are different places to put each type of bill and coin (for example, all the 1-dollar bills go in one part, and all the 25 cent coins go in another part). The cashier puts the bills and coins from the customer into the right places in the drawer, and takes out bills and coins that add up to the amount of change that the customer is supposed to get. The cashier closes the drawer and gives the change and receipt to the customer.\nMany modern cash registers and POS terminals also allow payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT), such as a debit card or credit card. In this case, the customer has to use a small machine next to the cash register or POS terminal that reads the data from his or her card. Depending on the type of card being used, he or she and might have to enter a personal identification number (PIN) to confirm the transaction. Many debit and credit cards now have a feature called contactless payment, which allows the user to simply tap his or her card on the reader to pay, making it quicker than other methods such as a chip or magnetic stripe. It uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology, which is compatible with near field communication (NFC) that is built into many mobile phones. Companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all made NFC-based mobile payment systems for platforms like iOS, Android, and Windows.\nIn the 2010s, there is a type of POS terminal that is operated by the customer, rather than a cashier. With this self-checkout, the customer scans the items he or she wishes to buy, and then pays by inserting cash or a credit card. These types of checkouts still have someone to look after them, in case any customer needs help.\nHospitality.\nBesides retail, the hospitality industry also makes use of cash registers and POS systems. Depending on where the system is used, they usually work differently from those in retail. For example, a restaurant cash register has to store information about every order, such as who ordered what from each table, whether the bill should be split or not, and whether a tip is added. Another example is in hotels, where a cash register has to store information about every room, such as who has booked the room, for how long, and what extra services are needed."}

The three party leaders are shown below.\nOutcome.\nThe election resulted in a hung parliament, where no political party has an overall majority of seats. This is the first time this has happened since 1974. \nThe Conservative Party won 307 out of the 650 seats available making them the largest party in the House of Commons. A coalition was then formed between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats who together had enough seats for a majority. This is the first coalition government in the United Kingdom since World War II. \nThe Leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron became Prime Minister of the United Kigdom on 11 May 2010 and the leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg became the Deputy Prime Minister. Before the election, the Leader of the Labour Party Gordon Brown was the Prime Minister.\nThis was the first British general election where the leaders of the three main parties took part together in a series of debates for television. The first debate was shown on ITV and was moderated by Alastair Stewart. It was on the subject of domestic affairs and polls taken after the debate showed that most people thought Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had done the best and the Liberal Democrats then saw a large rise in support in opinion polls, even beating Labour for second place behind the Conservatives. \nThe second debate, on the subject of Foreign Affairs was shown on Sky News and was moderated by Adam Boulton. Polls after this debate showed that Nick Clegg and David Cameron had done best with Gordon Brown slightly behind. The third and final debate was shown on BBC One and was moderated by David Dimbleby. It was on the subject of the economy and taxes and most opinion polls indicated that David Cameron had performed the best out of the three leaders.\nThe Conservative Party gained support from the following newspapers: the \"Daily Express\", the \"Daily Mail\", the \"Sun\", the \"Daily Telegraph\", the \"Times\", the \"Daily Star\", the \"Evening Standard\", the \"Financial Times\", \"Sunday Express\", the \"Mail on Sunday\", the \"News of the World\", the \"Sunday Telegraph\" and the \"Sunday Times\". The Liberal Democrats were supported by: the \"Guardian\", the \"Observer\" and the \"Independent\". Only the \"Daily Mirror\" and the \"Sunday Mirror\" supported the Labour Party and the \"People\" newspaper favoured a coalition.\nThis election saw the Conservative Party return to government for the first time since 1997 and also saw the Liberal Democrats get their first ever representation in government. Peter Robinson, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party unexpectedly lost his seat to the Alliance Party. The Green Party of England and Wales gained its first ever seat in the House of Commons and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland gained its first seat in the House of Commons since 1974. Former Labour Party Home Secretaries Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke both lost their seats. The Ulster Unionist Party and the Respect Party won seats in the 2005 General Election but lost their seats in the 2010 Election. \nResults by party.\nThe final results of the election were: \nThe seat of North Down was won by an Independent candidate and the seat of Buckingham was won by the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, who is not considered to be of any political party."}

They were usually planted and \"trained\" to form a barrier. They marked the boundary of an area, and so were a sign of possession. \nLivestock farmers use them to prevent cattle straying out of fields. Animals which cannot usually be contained in fields (hill sheep for example) need a man and dog to look after them, which is an expense. Hedges were much more common before modern agriculture. Modern crop farming uses machines to gather the crop, and so hedges have almost disappeared in some areas.\nWhen hedges are first laid, they are usually all of one species. But over hundreds of years, the number of species in a hedge gradually increases, and often includes fully-grown trees. There are many hedges in Europe which have been there for 500 or a thousand years.\nMaking hedges into ornaments is a skill called topiary. Sometimes, hedges are made into mazes.\nHedges are vitally important to small birds and mammals. In the modern world they play the role which thick forest undergrowth would have played in an ancient ecology. The nests in a hedge or thicket often cannot be got at by larger predators. Obviously tiny birds like robins or finches choose safe places to nest, and if they cannot, then their brood is unlikely to survive. "}

She first role was as Shirley in John Osborne's play \"Inadmissible Evidence\" at the Donmar Warehouse on October 16th 2011.\nAt the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Gillan said she will be on \"Doctor Who\" for its seventh series. On 15 December 2011, it was said that Gillan and Arthur Darvill (Rory Williams) would only be on the early part of seventh series, in 2012.\nAfter leaving \"Doctor Who\", Gillan has appeared in 2013 horror film \"Oculus\" and 2014 Marvel superhero science fiction film \"Guardians of the Galaxy\". Both of films received positive reviews from critics, while \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $774 million worldwide. Also in 2014, she was cast as the main character in ABC's sitcom \"Selfie\".\nIn May 2015, it was announced that Gillan was cast in the Adam McKay-directed drama film \"The Big Short\" alongside Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and Melissa Leo. She directed her first short film, \"Coward\", which won several awards and screened at the 2015 Edinburgh Film Festival. Later that year, in September, Gillan was cast as one of the main characters, Annie, in the movie \"The Circle\" alongside Emma Watson, Tom Hanks and John Boyega. The film is directed and written by James Ponsoldt and is based on the novel written by Dave Eggers."}

As a probability distribution, it is usually called a \"Cauchy distribution\". Physicists know it as a \"Lorentz distribution\". \nWhen the location parameter is 0 and the scale parameter is 1, the probability density function of the Cauchy distribution reduces to formula_1. This is called the standard Cauchy distribution. \nThe Cauchy distribution is used in spectroscopy to describe the spectral lines found there, and to describe resonance. It is also often used in statistics as the canonical example of a \"pathological\" distribution, since both its mean and its variance are undefined. The look of a Cauchy distribution is similar to that of a normal distribution, though with longer \"tails\". \nDue to this, estimating the mean value may not converge to any single value with more data (law of large numbers) unlike a normal distribution; due to a higher chance of getting extreme values (the tails of a frequency plot).

He ruled with Lucius Verus as co-emperor from 161 until Verus' death in 169.\nHe was the last of the Five Good Emperors, and is considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers.\nMarcus Aurelius' work \"Meditations\", written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, is still revered. It serves as an example of how Aurelius approached the Platonic ideal of a philosopher\u2013king, and how he symbolized much of what was best about Roman civilization.\nContinuous warfare.\nAt the start of his reign, the Empire, under the joint rule of Marcus and Lucius Verus, defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in a war from 161 to 166.\nThe unforeseen consequences for the Empire were great. The returning troops brought with them a plague (the so-called Antonine Plague), which may have been smallpox. It would eventually kill about 5 million people, and severely weaken the Empire.\nAurelius fought the German tribes during a long war from 166 to 180. The pressure from the Goths moving west pushed settled Germanic tribes into invading Roman client states in Gaul, and across the Danube.\nThe plague raging in the Empire limited Rome's ability to respond. The \"Marcomanni\" tribe entered Italy, which had not been invaded for nearly 200 years, and defeated the army of the Praetorian Prefect.\nThis disaster forced Marcus to collect forces from other frontiers, and move them against the \"Marcomanni\". The Roman army was commanded by Claudius Pompeianus, Marcus' son-in-law, with the future emperor Pertinax as one of his lieutenants. The invaders were thrown out of Italy, and Marcus began planning to cross the Danube into their territory.\nIntense diplomatic activity followed, as the Romans tried to win over various barbarian tribes in preparation for a crossing of the Danube. A peace treaty was signed with some tribes, while others became Roman allies. In 172, Marcus defeated the \"Marcommani\", and in 173 their allies, the \"Quadi\", were defeated. It took until 174 for the \"Quadi\" to be subdued.\nMarcus was now interrupted by a revolt in the east, led by the Roman general Avidius Cassius. He was suppressed by Marcus' army. Marcus then returned to Rome. A triumph was celebrated with his son Commodus.\nIn 177 the \"Quadi\" rebelled again, and the \"Marcommani\" joined them. Marcus arrived on the scene in August 178, and in due course the Romans won a decisive battle in what is now Slovakia. The emperor Marcus died in 180, still fighting the German tribes.\nVictories were achieved in the next couple of years, sufficient for Commodus to claim credit with a triumph. The battles had been fought by his generals.\nAftermath.\nThe war had exposed the weakness of Rome's northern frontier. From then on, half the Roman legions (16 out of 33) would be stationed along the Danube and the Rhine. For the Germanic tribes, although for the moment checked, the Marcomannic wars were only the prelude. Later invasions in the 4th and 5th centuries would eventually end the Western Roman Empire.\nMarriage and issue.\nAurelius married his first cousin Faustina the Younger in 145. During their 30-year marriage Faustina bore 13 children. Only one son and four daughters outlived their father:"}

This may not mean the dinosaurs were more diverse or abundant; it may be because substantial resources have been devoted to the North American fossil record.\nThe Middle Jurassic is the only poorly represented time period in North America, although several Middle Jurassic localities are known from Mexico. Footprints, eggshells, teeth, and fragments of bone representing theropods, sauropods, and ornithopods have been found, but none of them are diagnostic to the genus level. \nThe Upper Jurassic of North America, however, is the exact opposite of the Middle Jurassic. The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation is found in several U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. It is notable as being the most fertile single source of dinosaur fossils in the world. \nDuring the Lower Cretaceous, new dinosaurs appeared. Sauropods were still present, but they were not as diverse as they were in the Jurassic. Theropods from the early Cretaceous of North America include dromaeosaurs such as \"Deinonychus\" and \"Utahraptor\", \"Acrocanthosaurus\", and \"Microvenator\". Sauropods included \"Astrodon\", \"Pleurocoelus\", and \"Sauroposeidon\". Ornithischians were more diverse than they were in the Jurassic Period. \"Tenontosaurus\", \"Hypsilophodon\", \"Iguanodon\", \"Protohadros\", and \"Eolambia\" are some of the ornithopods that lived then. Ankylosaurs replaced their stegosaur cousins in the Cretaceous. Ankylosaurs from the early Cretaceous of North America include \"Sauropelta\" and \"Gastonia\". Therizinosaurs such as \"Falcarius\" are also known from the early Cretaceous of North America.\nFinally, in the long Upper Cretaceous, the greatest abundance and diversity of dinosaurs of all time lived in North America. During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous, the therizinosaur \"Nothronychus\" and the ceratopsian \"Zuniceratops\" lived. During the Campanian stage (83.672 mya), an enormous diversity of dinosaurs is known. Theropods included the tyrannosaurs \"Albertosaurus\", \"Gorgosaurus\", \"Daspletosaurus\", \"Appalachiosaurus\", and \"Dryptosaurus\", and the dromaeosaurids \"Dromaeosaurus\", \"Saurornitholestes\", \"Atrociraptor\", and \"Bambiraptor\". Ceratopsians, such as \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", \"Styracosaurus\", \"Centrosaurus\" \"Monoclonius\", \"Brachyceratops\", \"Pentaceratops\", and \"Leptoceratops\" also existed. Among hadrosaurs, \"Parasaurolophus\", \"Corythosaurus\", \"Lambeosaurus\", \"Saurolophus\", and \"Prosaurolophus\" existed. \nDuring the latest Cretaceous, the Maastrichtian stage (7265.5 mya), the diversity of dinosaurs wasn't as great as the preceding Campanian stage. North American herbivorous dinosaurs then included the titanosaur sauropod \"Alamosaurus\", the ceratopsians \"Triceratops\" and \"Torosaurus\", the pachycephalosaurs \"Pachycephalosaurus\", \"Stygimoloch\", \"Dracorex\", and \"Stegoceras\", the hadrosaurs \"Edmontosaurus\" and \"Anatotitan\". Predatory dinosaurs from this time period included \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Nanotyrannus\" (which may just be a juvenile of the former), and the troodontid \"Troodon\".\n \nTimeline.\nThis is a timeline of selected dinosaurs from the list above.

At that time, the earth had one supercontinental landmass, called Pangaea, of which Europe was a part. So it remained throughout the Triassic. By the start of the Jurassic period, some 30 million years later, the supercontinent began to split into Laurasia and Gondwana. The largest inlet from Panthalassa, the superocean that surrounded Pangaea, was called the Tethys Ocean, and as this inlet cut deeper into the supercontinent, much of Europe was flooded.\nBy the Cretaceous, from 145 to 65 million years ago, the continents were beginning to approach their present shapes, but not their present positions, and Europe remained tropical. At times, it was a chain of island-microcontinents including Baltica and Iberia.\nEurope is relatively rich in fossils from the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary, and much of what is known about European dinosaurs dates from this time. As the timeline below illustrates, there are substantial gaps in our knowledge from the rest of the Mesozoic. The absence of dinosaur genera from this time is because few fossils have been discovered, and almost certainly not because Europe contained few types of dinosaur\u2014except, perhaps, immediately after the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event.\nTimeline.\nThis is a timeline of selected dinosaurs from the list above.

{"id": "270131", "revid": "766335", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=270131", "title": "Commodus", "text": "Commodus (Lucius Aurelius Commodus Antoninus, 31 August 161 \u2013 31 December 192) was Roman emperor from 177 to 192. He was co-emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 until his father's death in 180. From 180 to his death in 192, Commodus was the only emperor.\nHis accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79. Commodus was the first emperor \"born to the purple\", that is, born during his father's reign.\nSole reign (180\u2013192).\nThe reign of Marcus Aurelius had been marked by almost continuous warfare, even though he preferred books to war. That of Commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife, and the arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself. In the view of Dio Cassius, a contemporary observer, his accession marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\". The historian Edward Gibbon took Commodus's reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire.\nDespite his notoriety, Commodus's years in power are not well chronicled. \nCommodus remained with the Danube armies for only a short time before negotiating a peace treaty with the Danubian tribes. He then returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for the conclusion of the wars on 22 October 180.\nUnlike the preceding Emperors Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, Commodus had little interest in the business of administration. He left the running of the state to a succession of favourites, beginning at this time with Saoterus, a freedman from Nicomedia who had become his chamberlain.\nThis state of affairs lead to a series of conspiracies and attempted coups, which in turn eventually provoked Commodus to take charge of affairs, which he did in an increasingly dictatorial manner.\nNevertheless, though the senatorial order came to hate and fear him, the evidence suggests that he remained popular with the army and the common people for much of his reign. He made lavish shows of gifts (recorded on his coinage) and he staged and took part in spectacular gladiatorial combats.\nOne of the ways he paid for his mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state, the Senate and People (\"Senatus Populusque Romanus\") is provocatively reversed (\"Populus Senatusque...\").\nThe conspiracies of 182.\nAt the outset of his reign, Commodus, aged 19, inherited many of his father's senior advisers. He also had five surviving sisters, all of them with husbands who were potential rivals. Four of his sisters were considerably older than he; the eldest, Lucilla, held the rank of Augusta as the widow of her first husband, Lucius Verus.\nThe first crisis of the reign came in 182, when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother. Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the Empress Crispina. Her husband, Pompeianus, was not involved, but two men, alleged to have been her lovers, attempted to murder Commodus as he entered the theatre.\nThey bungled the job. They were seized by the emperor's bodyguard, and executed; Lucilla was exiled to Capri and later killed. Pompeianus retired from public life. One of the two Praetorian Prefects, Tarrutenius Paternus, had actually been involved in the conspiracy, but was not detected at this time. In the aftermath, he and his co-Prefect Sextus Tigidius Perennis organised the murder of Saoterus, the hated chamberlain.\nCommodus took the loss of Saoterus badly, and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy. Executions followed. Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in Cleander, a Phrygian freedman who had married one of the emperor's mistresses, Demostratia. Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus.\nAfter those attempts on his life, Commodus spent much of his time outside Rome, mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium. Though physically strong, he was mentally lazy, and his chief interest was in sport: taking part in horse racing, chariot racing, and combats with beasts and men, mostly in private but also on occasion in public.\nBritainnia.\nIn Britain in 184, the governor Ulpius Marcellus pushed the Roman frontier north to the Antonine Wall, but the soldiers revolted against his harsh discipline. Perennis had all the legionary legates in Britain dismissed.\nOn 15 October 184 at the Capitoline Games, a Cynic philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus, who was watching. He was immediately put to death. According to Dio Cassius, Perennis, though ruthless and ambitious, was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well.\nHowever, the following year, a detachment of soldiers from Britain (they had been drafted to Italy to suppress brigands) denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor. They had been enabled to do so by Cleander, who was seeking to dispose of his rival. Commodus gave the soldiers permission to execute Perennis and his wife and sons. The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions. Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as governor of Britain by Pertinax; brought to Rome and tried for treason, Marcellus narrowly escaped death.\nCleander's rise and fall (185\u2013190).\nCleander took power into his own hands and enriched himself by selling public offices: he sold and gave entry to the Senate, army commands, governorships, and even replacement consulships, to the highest bidder.\nUnrest around the empire increased, with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in Gaul and Germany. A revolt in Brittany was put down by two legions brought over from Britain. In 187, one of the leaders of the deserters, Maternus, came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March, but he was betrayed and executed.\nIn the same year, Pertinax unmasked a conspiracy by two enemies of Cleander. As a result, Commodus appeared even more rarely in public, preferring to live on his estates. Early in 188, Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect, and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians at the new rank of \"a pugione\" (\"dagger-bearer\") with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him. Now at the zenith of his power, Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business. The climax came in the year 190, which had 25 suffect consuls\u2014a record in the 1,000-year history of the Roman consulship\u2014all appointed by Cleander (they included the future Emperor Septimius Severus).\nIn the spring of 190, Rome was afflicted by a food shortage, for which the official actually in charge of the grain supply managed to lay the blame on Cleander. At the end of June, a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the Circus Maximus: he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances, but Pertinax, who was now City Prefect of Rome, dispatched the \"Vigiles Urbani\" to oppose them.\nCleander fled to Commodus, who was at Laurentum in the house of the Quinctilii, for protection, but the mob followed him calling for his head. At the urging of his mistress Marcia, Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed. Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus, Commodus's cousin Annia Fundania Faustina, and his brother-in-law Mamertinus. Papirius Dionysius was executed too.\nCommodus continued to rule through a cabal, which now consisted of Marcia, his new chamberlain Eclectus, and the new praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus, who about this time also had many Christians freed from working in the mines in Sardinia. Marcia is alleged to have been a Christian.\nA new order (190\u2013192).\nDuring 191, the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days, during which many public buildings including the Temple of Pax, the Temple of Vesta and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed.\nCommodus presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire and Roman life and religion. He also had the head of the Colossus of Nero adjacent to the Colosseum replaced with his own portrait, gave it a club and placed a bronze lion at its feet to make it look like Hercules, and added an inscription boasting of being \"the only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men\".\nCommodus the gladiator.\nThe emperor also had a passion for gladiatorial combat, which he took so far as to take to the arena himself, dressed as a gladiator. The Romans found Commodus' naked gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful. It was rumoured that he was actually the son, not of Marcus, but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of Caieta. In the arena, Commodus always won since his opponents always submitted to the emperor. Thus, these public fights would not end in a death. Privately, it was his custom to slay his practice opponents. For each appearance in the arena, he charged the city of Rome a million sesterces, straining the Roman economy.\nMilitary officials in Rome were enraged at his behaviour in the arena. Often, wounded soldiers and amputees would be placed in the arena for Commodus to slay with a sword. Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena, where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants. These acts may have contributed to his assassination.\nCommodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena, often to the horror of the Roman people. According to Gibbon, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day.p106 Later, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart. and afterwards carried the bleeding head of the dead bird and his sword over to the section where the Senators sat and gesticulated as though they were next. On another occasion, Commodus killed three elephants on the floor of the arena by himself. Finally, Commodus killed a giraffe which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast.p107 \"Commodus killed a camelopardalis or giraffe...the most useless of the quadrupeds.\"\nAssassination.\nIn November 192, Commodus held Plebian Games in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning, and fought as a gladiator every afternoon, naturally winning all the bouts. In December he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January.\nAt this point, the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax, taking Marcia into their confidence. On 31 December Marcia poisoned his food but he vomited up the poison; so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner, Narcissus, to strangle him in his bath. On his death, the Senate declared him a public enemy and restored the original names to the city of Rome and its institutions. Commodus' statues were thrown down.\nCommodus was succeeded by Pertinax, whose reign was short lived, being the first to fall victim to the Year of the Five Emperors. Commodus's death marked the end of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, and the beginning of the end for the Western Roman Empire.\nCommodus in popular culture.\nThere are a number of semi-fictional versions of his life. The most notable are the two films:"}

The biblical motifs are also a reflection of his origin; they are distinctly orthodox. Jekatarina Seleznjova states that in her opinion the fundamental question asks in his paintings is \u201dWhy are we here?\u201d (Seleznjova, 2007), and thus despite the culturally characteristic motifs, Kolkoutine's paintings are supposed to touch something universally human. Kolkoutines paintings are both simple and complicated it is said."}

The court ruled that a state law that banned abortions (To save the mother) was unconstitutional. The ruling made abortion legal in many circumstances. The decision said that a woman's right to privacy extended to the fetus/unborn child she was carrying. In the view of the court, during the first trimester an abortion was no more dangerous than carrying the fetus/child full term. The decision was 7-2, with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and six other Justices voting for \"Jane Roe\", and Justices William Rehnquist and Byron White voting against it. \nThe decision divided the nation and is still controversial today. People divided into pro-life and pro-choice groups. Pro-life supporters argue that the unborn baby has the same right to life as other people, and the government should intervene to protect it. Pro-choice supporters believe that the unborn baby is not the same as a person, and the woman has the right to choose what she wants to do with her body and that the government should not intervene. Roe was limited by a later decision called \"Webster v. Reproductive Health\" (1989), which allowed regulation of abortion in some cases. Several states have considered laws banning abortions altogether.\nBackground.\nIt began in Texas as a challenge against a law prohibiting any kind of abortion unless the mother's life was in danger. In 1970 a pregnant Texas woman, Norma McCorvey (alias Jane Roe), brought a lawsuit against Henry Wade, Dallas County District Attorney, in a Texas federal court. Alleging she was a single woman and pregnant, McCorvey wanted to terminate her pregnancy. She wanted it done safely by a doctor but said she could not afford to travel outside of Texas. She could not get a legal abortion in Texas because her life was not in danger. Her lawsuit claimed that the Texas law violated her right to privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Roe added she sued \"on behalf of herself and all other women\" in the same situation. The case slowly made its way to the US Supreme Court. Meanwhile, McCorvey had her baby and placed it for adoption.\nThe majority decision.\nIn a 7-2 decision, the court held that a woman's right to an abortion was protected by her right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision allowed a woman to decide whether to keep or abort the fetus/unborn child during the first trimester. This affected the laws of 46 states. Justice Harry Blackmun wrote the majority opinion. \u201cWe \u2026 acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires.\u201d \u2014 Justice Blackmun (1973).\nDissenting opinion.\nThe dissenting opinion was written by Justice William Rehnquist. He objected to the majority decision giving several reasons. \nUnderstanding Roe v. Wade.\nRight to privacy interpretation.\nThe basis for the \"right to privacy\" is a judicial interpretation that can be traced from an earlier case \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965). In this landmark case, the Supreme Court ruled a Connecticut law prohibiting the use of contraceptives violated the right to privacy as found in the Constitution. However, the right to privacy is not directly mentioned in the Constitution. The Supreme Court has stated that the Right to Privacy is implied by several amendments. Beginning in 1923 the court interpreted the \"liberty\" guarantee in the Fourteenth Amendment as a broad right to privacy. Justice William O. Douglas stated the guarantees of the right to privacy had penumbras (implied rights) \"formed by emanations (a flowing) from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.\"\nTrimester concept.\nIn its decision, the court used the three trimester framework of pregnancy. During the first trimester an abortion was safer for the mother than childbirth. The reasoning was that the decision whether to get an abortion at this stage should be left up to the mother to decide. Any law that interfered with abortions in the first trimester would be presumed to be unconstitutional. During the second trimester laws could regulate abortion only to protect the health of the mother. During the third trimester the unborn child was viable (able to live on its own outside the mother's womb). So laws could restrict or prohibit abortions except in cases where it was necessary to preserve the mother's health. This doctrine stood until 1992. In \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" (1992) the court changed from basing the legality of an abortion on trimesters to basing it on fetal viability."}

The underlying laws do not change, but the system as a whole changes. Symmetry breaking in physics occurs when a system is crossing a critical point. Small fluctuations decide the system's fate, by determining which branch is taken. \nUses for spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking can create a particle called a Higgs boson. This is a particle which is the force transferring particle (boson) of the Higgs field. The Higgs field gives mass to fundamental particles such as electrons. Also, many scientists believe in the Higgs effect (which is very similar to spontaneous symmetry breaking) to answer questions that are not answered in the standard model of physics. The standard model predicts that certain types of quarks should have a mass of zero, while in reality they have a non-zero mass value. Some scientists believe that spontaneous symmetry breaking is the answer.\nMethod of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nFor spontaneous symmetry breaking to happen, you need an environment which is completely symmetrical, and has at least two outcomes that are equally likely. Spontaneous symmetry breaking starts with two particles that are completely equal; their spin is equal, too. Mathematically, spontaneous symmetry breaking can be extremely puzzling, since you start out with two identical things and end up with two non-identical things. However, in practice, it is not so puzzling. If you have two particles moving at each other with equal speed, it would seem impossible for either of them to do anything but be symmetrical. However, if each particle has an equal 50-50 chance to be spinning one way or another, it is possible\u2013in theory and in practice\u2013to have this symmetry broken. It begins with symmetry to start with because the particles have an equal and symmetrical 50-50 chance of spinning one way or another."}

Archimedes' principle relates buoyancy to displacement.\nPrinciple.\nArchimedes' treatise, \"On floating bodies\", proposition five states: \nFor more general objects, floating and sunken, and in gases as well as liquids (i.e. a fluid), Archimedes' principle may be stated thus in terms of forces:\nFor a sunken object, the volume of displaced fluid is the volume of the object, and for a floating object on a liquid, the weight of the displaced liquid is the weight of the object.\nBriefly: Buoyancy = weight of displaced fluid.\nGold.\nTo use the principle to tell the difference between gold and another substance, the concept of mass (in practice, weight) must be added.\nApply this formula to a suitably pure piece of gold:\nThat gives you the density of the gold sample. The only unknown is the \"density of the (gold) object\"; the density of water is 1.\nRepeat for the experimental object (non-gold), when you get a different (and usually lesser) density.\nNow you can tell what is gold and what is not, and collect your reward from the King of Syracuse. That is why Archimedes shouted \"Eureka!\" \nSecond thoughts.\nWe do not actually know if Archimedes used exactly this method. An alternative is to use a scale. On one side put the object to be tested (e.g. the crown). On the other side put gold of \"equal weight\". Immerse the scales. The gold will go down, and the crown up (if it is not gold). That is because, being less dense than gold, it occupies a larger volume and receives more buoyancy."}

He is known for being the former leader of the UK Independence Party. Farage has been an important figure in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.\nPolitical career.\nNigel Farage left the Conservative Party in 1992 after the Maastricht Treaty was signed by John Major's Conservative government. He was first elected as a Member of the European Parliament in 1999 and was re-elected in 2004 and 2009. In September 2006, he was elected to become the UKIP leader and was party leader during the 2009 European Parliament election where UKIP received the second highest number of votes after the Conservative Party.\nIn November 2009, Farage resigned as UKIP leader because he wanted to concentrate on being elected to the House of Commons at the 2010 General Election. At the general election, Farage failed to be elected and became the UKIP leader again in November 2010.\nFarage stood for election as an MP for South Thanet in 2015. He lost to Craig Mackinlay. He resigned as leader. Four days later, Farage became the leader of the party again.\nFarage was instrumental in the Brexit campaign and was regarded by many as the main factor why the Leave campaign won and the UK voted to leave the European Union. On 25 August 2016, Farage was invited to a Donald Trump rally, in Jackson, Mississippi, to give him his support in the run-up to the US election in November 2016. During the rally, he said the famous quote \"If I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me. In fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me.\"\nFarage is thought to be the first British politician to address a Republican presidential election rally. Speaking from the United States, Mr. Farage told The Daily Telegraph: \u201cBrexit is just massive over here. I went to the [Republican party] convention in Cleveland and I just could not believe that ordinary people are talking to me about Brexit. They see it as a victory of ordinary people against big business, big banks, and big politics. \u201cThe Republican activists and managers here are keen to hear the Brexit story, hear how we managed to get 2.5 million people who don\u2019t normally vote at all to go down to the polling station.\" Ever since the allegations about Russian interference in the US election, Farage has been viewed by the FBI as a \"person of interest\" in order to discover wherever he also interfered with the election, like the Russian government.\nOn Tuesday 4 December 2018, Nigel Farage left the UKIP Party as he believed it's new leader Gerard Batten was becoming too obsessed with Tommy Robinson and Islam.\nPersonal life.\nIn his early twenties, Farage was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He made a full recovery.\nFarage has been married twice. He married Gr\u00e1inne Hayes in 1988. They had two children: Samuel (1989) and Thomas (1991). The marriage ended in divorce in 1997. In 1999 he married Kirsten Mehr, a German national. They have two children, Victoria (born 2000) and Isabelle (born 2005)."}

Severus seized power after the death of Emperor Pertinax in 193 during the so-called Year of the Five Emperors. After deposing the incumbent emperor Didius Julianus in a bloodless coup, Severus fought his rival claimants, the generals Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. Niger was defeated in 194 at the Battle of Issus, and Albinus three years later at the Battle of Lugdunum.\nAfter solidifying his rule, Severus waged a brief war against the Parthian Empire, sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 197. In 202 he campaigned in Africa against the Garamantes, briefly taking their capital Garama and expanding the southern frontier of the empire radically.\nLate in his reign he fought the Picts in Caledonia and strengthened Hadrian's Wall in Britain.

Hadrosaurs probably lived near bodies of water, migrating to high ground to lay eggs. It used to be thought that they had webbed hands, but this was an artifact of the fossilization process.\nIt is a very interesting thing that, as Bakker says, the duckbills were so common, yet they had no obvious defence against the large carnivores. Perhaps herd organisation and running speed were sufficient. Their eating apparatus must have been an advantage as compared to other herbivores.\nAn exceptional fossil.\nOne of the most complete hadrosaur specimens was found in 1999 in Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota and is known as \"Dakota\". This fossil is so well preserved that scientists have been able to calculate its muscle mass and learn that it was more muscular than previously thought, probably giving it the ability to outrun predators such as \"Tyrannosaurus rex\".\nThis mummified hadrosaur fossil comes complete with skin (not merely skin impressions), ligaments, tendons, and possibly some internal organs. It is being analyzed in the world's largest CT scanner, operated by the Boeing Co. The machine usually is used for detecting flaws in space shuttle engines and other large objects, but previously none so large as this. Researchers hope the technology will help them learn more about the fossilized insides of the creature.\nThey found a gap of about a centimeter between each vertebra, indicating that there may have been a disk or other material between them, allowing more flexibility and meaning the animal was actually longer than shown in a museum. Skin impressions have been found from the following hadrosaurs: \"Edmontosaurus annectens\", \"Corythosaurus casuarius\", \"Brachylophosaurus canadensis\", \"Gryposaurus notabilis\", \"Parasaurolophus walkeri\", \"Lambeosaurus magnicristatus\", \"Lambeosaurus lambei\", \"Saurolophus osborni,\" and \"Saurolophus angustirostris\".\nTwo clades.\nLambeosaurines had narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, which suggests that \"Lambeosaurus\" and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts."}

It is a tape format which was created so people could play music in their cars. Unlike cassettes, 8 tracks are a continuous loop of tape. They did not need to be turned over to keep playing. There were four programs of music on each tape with two tracks on each program to create stereo sound. When the track was over, a very thin piece of metal in the tape would be sensed. This would cause the part of the player that read the tape (the \"head\") to start reading the next track. 8 tracks became very popular in the early 1970s. They were used both in the home and car.\nIn the 1970s, the cassette tape was improved. It eventually had better quality than 8-tracks. By the late 1970s, cassettes became more popular than 8-tracks. In 1980, 8-tracks were rarely being made. They could still be bought through mail order record clubs until 1987. Today there are still a small number of people who collect 8 tracks.\nProblems.\nThe 8-track had many problems. Unlike cassettes, the rubber roller was in the cartridge. It would often wear out. This could cause a gooey substance in the tapes. This also caused the tapes to wear out quickly. The spacing between the tracks were very narrow. Music from tracks other than the one being played could often be heard. The sensing foil in the tape would sometimes break off. This would stop the tape from changing tracks."}

{"id": "270490", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=270490", "title": "New South Greenland", "text": "New South Greenland, which is also known as Morrell's Land, was an appearance of land recorded by the American captain Benjamin Morrell. Morrel reported the sighting on the schooner \"Wasp\" in , during a seal hunting and exploration voyage in the Weddell Sea area of Antarctica. He provided precise coordinates and a description of a coastline. Morrel claimed to have sailed along the coastline for more than . The Weddel Sea is in the Antarctic. Because of icebergs, it was difficult to navigate, and few people did. The sighting was never investigated properly, at the time. Expeditions to Antarctica in the early 20th century proved that there was no land at the positions recorded by Morrell.\nAt the time of Morrell's voyage the Weddel Sea had not been named and its geography and coastline was almost entirely unknown. This made the sighting plausible at the start. Morrell made obvious errors when he told about the new sighting. He also had the reputation of liking to invent new stories. These two aspects made many people sceptical about the sighting. In the German explorer Wilhelm Filchner's ship \"Deutschland\" was blocked by ice in the Weddel Sea and drifted into the area, where Morrell had reported the new land. Filchcher searched for the land, but found no trace of it. A sounding of the sea bottom revealed more than of water, indicating no land nearby. Three years later, trapped in the same waters with his ship \"Endurance\", Ernest Shackleton was able by similar means to confirm the land's non-existence.\nDifferent explanations for Morell's error have been suggested. One of them is that Morrell wanted to deceive with this claimed finding. Morrell describes his sighting briefly, and seeks no personal credit or glory from the discovery. In his narrative, he gives all credit to his fellow sealing captain, Robert Johnson, for finding and naming the land two years earlier. Morrell may have been honestly mistaken, through miscalculation of his ship's position or by misremembering detail when writing the account after nine years. Alternatively, he may have made the common error of confusing distant icebergs with land, or been misled by the distorting effects of Antarctic mirage. In 1843 the distinguished British naval explorer James Clark Ross reported possible land in a position close to Morrell's; this land, too, would eventually be proven not to exist.\nVoyage of the \"Wasp\", 1822\u201323.\nFirst phase, June 1822 to March 1823.\nIn the early 19th century the geography of Antarctica was almost completely unknown, but occasional sightings of land had been recorded. Benjamin Morrell sailed to the South Sandwich Islands. Morrel was appointed commander of the schooner \"Wasp\" for a two-year voyage of sealing, trading and exploration in the Antarctic seas and the southern Pacific Ocean in 1822. In addition to his sealing duties Morrell had, as he put it, \"discretionary powers to prosecute new discoveries.\" He proposed to use this discretion to investigate the Antarctic seas \"and to ascertain the practicality\u00a0... of penetrating to the South Pole.\" This would be the first of four long voyages that would keep Morrell at sea for most of the following eight years, although he would not revisit the Antarctic after the initial voyage.\n\"Wasp\" sailed south from New York on 1822. She reached the Falkland Islands late in October, after which Morrell spent 16 days in fruitless searches for the nonexistent Aurora Islands, before heading for South Georgia, where the ship anchored on . In his account Morrell wrongly records the position of this anchorage, placing it in open sea about south-west of the island's coastline. \"Wasp\" then headed eastwards to hunt for seals. According to Morrell, the ship reached the remote Bouvet Island on . He found this elusive island without apparent difficulty. Historian H.R. Mill notes that Morrell's description of the island's physical features fails to mention the island's most singular characteristic\u2014it is covered by a permanent ice sheet. Morrell then attempted to take the ship southwards. He reached think ice around 60\u00b0S and decided to turn northeast towards the Kerguelen Islands where he anchored on .\nAfter several days of exploration and evidently profitable sealing, \"Wasp\" left the Kerguelens on 1823, sailing south and east to record her furthest eastern position at 64\u00b052'S, 118\u00b027'E on . From this point, according to his own account, Morrell decided to take advantage of strong easterly winds, and made a rapid passage westward back to the Greenwich meridian, 0\u00b0. His account is light on details, but indicates that a distance of more than was covered in 23\u00a0days. The credibility of this claim of such fast, direct travel in ice-infested waters has been widely disputed, particularly as Morrell quotes southerly latitudes during the voyage which later proved to be at least 100\u00a0miles inside the then undiscovered Antarctic continental mainland. On \"Wasp\" reached Candlemas Island in the South Sandwich Islands. After a few days spent in a search for fuel to feed the ship's stoves \"Wasp\" sailed southwards on , into the area later known as the Weddell Sea. Finding the sea remarkably free of ice, Morrell advanced to 70\u00b014'S before turning north-westward on . This retreat, Morrell says, was due to the ship's lack of fuel; otherwise, he claims, in these open waters he could have taken the ship to 85\u00b0, or perhaps to the Pole itself. These words are very similar to those used by the British explorer James Weddell to describe his own experiences in the same area, a month earlier. This has led historians to believe that Morrel may have copied the section from Weddel's.\nSighting of land.\nAt 2 pm next day, 15 March, as \"Wasp\" cruised north-east in the sea that would later bear Weddell's name, Morrell records: \"land was seen from the masthead, bearing west, distance 3 leagues\" (about nine miles, 14\u00a0km). His account continues: \"At half past we were close on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland\". Robert Johnson, a former captain of the \"Wasp\", had made an exploratory voyage along the western coast of the Antarctic peninsula in 1821. Johnson had called it \"New South Greenland\". Morrell casually referred to Johnston's description. This indicates that Morrell assumed that the land he was seeing was in fact the east coast of the pensinsula. At the time he wrote this, his position was about 14 degrees east of that pensinsula. The geographical features of the pensinsula were not known at the time of Morrell's voyage. Morrell describes seal hunting activities continuing along this coast during the remainder of the day. On the following morning sealing resumed as the ship moved slowly southward, and continued until Morrell called a halt \"because of shortage of water and season far advanced\". Mountains of snow, he observed, could be seen about further south.\nMorrell turned north from a position he calculated as 67\u00b052'S, 48\u00b011W. Three days later, on , the ship passed what he took to be the northern cape of the land, at 62\u00b041'S, 47\u00b021'W. \"This land abounds with oceanic birds of every description\", wrote Morrell. He also records seeing 3,000 sea elephants. At 10 o'clock \"Wasp\" \"bade farewell to the cheerless shores of New South Greenland\"; there is no further mention of it in the long voyage account. \"Wasp\" sailed for Tierra del Fuego, then through the Magellan Strait into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Valparaiso, Chile, on 1823.\nFrom the first navigations of the Southern Ocean in the 16th century, lands which subsequently proved to be nonexistent had from time to time been reported in these waters. Polar historian Robert Headland of the Scott Polar Research Institute has suggested various reasons for these false sightings, ranging from \"too much rum\" to deliberate hoaxes designed to lure rival ships away from good sealing grounds. Some may have been of large ice masses that were carrying rocks and other glacial debris\u2014dirty ice can appear convincingly similar to land. It is also possible that some of these lands existed, but later became submerged after volcanic eruptions. Other sightings may have been of actual land, wrongly located through observational errors due to chronometer failure, bad weather or simple incompetence.\nSearches for Morrell's land.\nDoubt was cast over the existence of New South Greenland when, in 1838, the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville sailed over the position of Morrell's \"north cape\", but saw no indication of land. This evidence, and the general nature of Morrell's account\u2014its obvious errors, and his reputation as a braggart \"as great\u00a0... as any hero of autobiographical romance\" in the words of British geographer Hugh Robert Mill, led many geographers thereafter to ignore his claims. This scepticism remained even after Sir James Clark Ross reported an appearance of land in 1843, not far from Morrell's alleged observation: Ross's sighting was occasionally proffered as supportive of Morrell's claim. There was no further penetration of the Weddell Sea until 1903, when William Speirs Bruce took \"Scotia\" to 74\u00b01'S, but in a sector of the sea which did not bring him close to Morrell's or Ross's sightings. Bruce was, however, generally well-disposed towards Morrell, writing that his claims should not be rejected until absolutely disproved.\nThe first determined search for New South Greenland came during the Second German Antarctic Expedition, 1911\u201313, under Wilhelm Filchner. The expedition's ship, \"Deutschland\", had become trapped in heavy sea ice while attempting to establish a shore base at Vahsel Bay. Her subsequent north-westerly drift had, by mid-, brought her to a position east of Morrell's recorded sighting. Filchner left the ship on and, with two companions and sufficient provisions for three weeks, sledged westward across the sea ice in search of Morrell's land. Daylight was limited to two or three hours a day, and temperatures fell to \u221231\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221235\u00a0\u00b0C), making travel difficult. In these conditions the group covered , taking frequent sightings. They found no signs of land; a lead weight dropped through the ice reached a depth of before the line snapped, a depth which confirmed there was no land in the vicinity. Filchner concluded that what Morrell had seen had been a mirage.\nOn 17 August 1915 Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship \"Endurance\", trapped in the ice like \"Deutschland\" three years earlier, drifted to a point 10\u00a0miles west of Morrell's charted position. Here, a depth sounding recorded 1,676\u00a0fathoms (10,060\u00a0feet, 3,065\u00a0m), leading Shackleton to write: \"I decided that Morrell Land must be added to the long list of Antarctic islands and continental coasts that have resolved themselves into icebergs\". On a further sounding of 1,900\u00a0fathoms (11,400\u00a0feet, 3,500\u00a0m) gave Shackleton additional evidence of the non-existence of New South Greenland.\nAlthough Filchner's and Shackleton's investigations and observations were accepted as conclusive proof that New South Greenland was a myth, there remained the question of Sir James Ross's reported appearance of land in a position around 65\u00b0S, 47\u00b0W. Ross's reputation was sufficient for this possibility to be taken seriously, and for his alleged sighting to be recorded on maps and Admiralty charts. In 1922 Frank Wild, leading the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition aboard \"Quest\" after Shackleton's death early in the expedition, investigated the location of Ross's sighting. Nothing was seen; prevented by ice conditions from reaching the exact spot, Wild took a sounding at 64\u00b011'S, 46\u00b04'W, which revealed of water. This showed that no land was near.\nOpinions and theories.\nAccording to W.J. Mills, Morrell had the reputation among his contemporaries as \"the biggest liar in the Southern Ocean\". Mills calls the westward journey from Morrell's claimed farthest east position \"impossible\u00a0... unbelievably fast, quite apart from lying south of the coastline for much of the way\". In search of an explanation Mills suggests that since Morrell's account was written nine years after the voyage he may not have had access to the ship's log, and hence may \"have felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible\" in order to sustain his narrative. This would explain the profusion of positional and date errors.\nHugh Robert Mill, writing in 1905 before the non-existence of New South Greenland had been proved conclusively, refers to the sheer absurdity of some of the incidents described in Morrell's account, and concludes that because of Morrell's blunders, and his habit of incorporating the experiences of others into his story, all his claims must be treated as not proven. Nevertheless he concedes that \"a man may be ignorant, boastful and obscure, and yet have done a solid piece of work\". Canadian geographer Paul Simpson-Housley adopts a more sympathetic approach. Although dubious about much of Morrell's account, Simpson-Housley suggests that the speeds claimed for the western journey, though fast, are not impossible. He believes that the claimed farthest south in the Weddell Sea, queried by Mill, is entirely plausible, given that James Weddell had sailed four degrees further south just a month earlier.\nAnother inclined to defend Morrell's integrity is the writer Rupert Gould, who included a lengthy essay on New South Greenland in his collection \"Enigmas\", published in 1929. The assumption that the New South Greenland sighting was simply invented by Morrell is dismissed, primarily on the grounds of the very little weight given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: \"If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his \"pi\u00e8ces justificatives\", after he had forged them, in an undistinguished corner of so bulky a book.\" In the relatively few pages devoted to the Antarctic, Morrell's account of his discovery is brief and entirely matter-of-fact, crediting it to Captain Johnson two years earlier rather than to himself.\nGould also discusses the possibility that what Morrell sighted was indeed the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called \"Foyn Coast\", despite its being 14\u00b0 further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. In support, Gould asserts that the peninsula's eastern coast corresponds very closely with the stretch of coastline described by Morrell. This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was \"destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments\", but other parts of his narrative make it clear that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm. In any circumstances a longitudinal error of 14\u00b0 is very large, and the additional distance of about to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould maintains that a \"balance of evidence\" shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.\nFilchner's view that the supposed sighting of New South Greenland could be explained by a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley. He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a superior mirage. One form of superior mirage, sometimes described as a Fata Morgana, distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally, so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys. In his expedition account \"South\", Shackleton gives a description of a Fata Morgana observed on 1915, coincidentally as his ship \"Endurance\" drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland: \"The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff-tops indicate distant bergs\u00a0... The lines rise and fall, tremble, dissipate, and reappear in an endless transformation scene\".\nAfterwards.\nMorrell's four voyages finally ended on 1831, with his return to New York. He then wrote his \"Narrative of Four Voyages\", which was published the following year. He attempted to resume his seafaring career, seeking employment with the London-based shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but his reputation had preceded him and he was rejected. Charles Enderby stated publicly that \"he had heard so much of him that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him.\" Morrell also sought to join Dumont D'Urville's expedition to the Weddell Sea in 1837, but his services were again declined. He reportedly died in 1839, and is commemorated by Morrell Island, 59\u00b027'S, 27\u00b019'W, an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub-group of the South Sandwich Islands. Robert Johnson, who coined the name New South Greenland, disappeared with his ship in 1826, while investigating the Antarctic waters in the vicinity of what would later be known as the Ross Sea."}

It ran from 1990 to 1998 on FOX Kids. It was set in 1979 in California. It was about the life of Bobby Generic ( ) and his imagination on how he sees the world. The show was made by Canadian actor-comedian Howie Mandel. Mandel also provided the voice of both Bobby and his father Howard Generic, who looks like a cartoon version of Mandel. It was made by Film Roman for Alevy Productions and Fox Kids, and later NBC Universal. The theme song for \"Bobby's World\" was made by John Tesh and Michael Hanna.\nHistory.\nThe character of \"Bobby\" can be traced back to Mandel's stand-up comedy performances; Mandel would commonly have the same voice as Bobby, often talking with an unseen \"parent\".\nThe voices of Kelly Generic (Bobby's sister) and Martha Generic (Bobby's mom) are based on two characters Gail Matthius played when she was a member on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1980. Martha is based on the character Roweena, a chain smoking hair stylist with a Upper Midwestern accent who gets into arguments with her best customer Nadine (Denny Dillon), while Kelly Generic is based on the character Vicky, a valley girl who annoys others with her shallow questions and rambling stories and often is seen with her friend Debbie (also Dillon).\nIn the US, during the show's final season on-air, the show was open-captioned; this was intended as an aid to help younger children learn to read.\nIn an April 2006 online interview, Mandel expressed his desire for a possible re-launch of the series. Episodes can be seen in syndication, or on some websites.\nAccording to a video posted on YouTube.com, Mandel mentions that they are working on new episodes.\nOn February 12, 2007, the character Bobby made a surprise appearance on an episode of \"Deal or No Deal\".\nShow format.\nEpisodes often consist of a short live-action segment either before or after the main story (and sometimes both before and after). The segment would include Mandel describing some aspect of the story and often relating it back to his personal childhood.\nSometimes during these segments, the character of Bobby would appear in animated form and converse with Mandel. Other times, a live action child would appear and exchange words with Mandel. Endings of the show also featured Mandel breaking the proverbial \"fourth wall\" by talking to viewers about the preceding episode. In some part of the episode, Bobby will break the fourth wall by telling the audience his perspective on life.\nVideo game.\nThe Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Game Gear made a video game from \"Bobby's World\", which was built by RSP and published by Hi Tech Entertainment. In the game, Bobby's mother tells him to clean his room. As he is cleaning his room Bobby starts daydreaming about a toy. After you beat a level, Bobby has another daydream about another toy that he puts away. "}

He was known as the \"Scandinavian Chagall\", and was one of the leading Danish artists of the second half of the 20th century.\nPedersen was born in Copenhagen and brought up in the poor area near Vigerslev Alle. He held radical political beliefs. He joined the International Folk High School in Elsinore in 1933, where he met self-taught painter Else Alfelt. They married in 1934, and their first daughter, Vibeke Alfelt, was born later that year. Else Alfelt encouraged Pedersen to paint, and he first exhibited at the Artists' Autumn Exhibition (\"Kunstnernes Efter\u00e5rsudstilling\") in Copenhagen in 1936, where he showed four abstract works. His modernist style was at odds with the socialist realism preferred by his communist friends, who snubbed him: he argued with Bertolt Brecht about his art. His abstract works, with flat planes of colour, emulated the works of cubists and of Paul Klee.\nPedersen travelled on foot to Paris in 1939, where he saw works by Picasso and Matisse. He visited the exhibition of \"degenerate art\" (\"entartete Kunst\") in Frankfurt am Main on his way home, where he was inspired by the paintings on show, particularly the works of Chagall, which remained a strong influence on his art for the rest of his life. His second daughter, Kari-Nina, was born in 1940. He joined the H\u00f8st group during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, writing about medieval Danish murals for its journal, \"Helhesten\", and continued to produce controversial modern abstract works. \nPedersen and Else Alfelt were founder members of the CoBrA movement in 1948 together with Asger Jorn, Karel Appel and others. The movement took its name from the European cities where its founders were based: Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam. They remained with the group until it dissolved in 1951, producing free-form, spontaneous images in strong, fantastic colours. He won the Eckersberg Award in 1950 and the Guggenheim Award in 1958. A retrospective was put on at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1961, and he was Denmark's representative at the Venice Biennale in 1962. He won the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1963.\nPedersen moved into monumental art in the 1960s and 1970s, producing a large mosaic, \"Cosmic Sea\", for the H. C. \u00d8rsted Institute at Copenhagen University, and a huge tiled wall decoration, \"Fantasy Play Around the Wheel of Life\", for the Angli courtyard in Herning.\nPedersen was known for resisting to sell his works. Instead, he donated thousands to the Carl-Henning Pedersen and Else Alfelt Museum, which opened in Herning in 1976. Further works were donated to the Danish National Gallery (\"Statens Museum for Kunst\") in early 2007.\nPedersen moved to Burgundy in the 1980s, but most of his work still came from Danish sources. He surprised many when he worked on the redecoration of the Gothic cathedral in Ribe, working on the murals, painted glass and mosaics to illustrate Bible stories from 1983 to 1987. He also produced bronze sculptures, and works in oils and watercolour.\nHe died in Copenhagen, after a long illness. He was survived by his second wife, Sidsel Ramson."}

It began in the first years of the city, which was supposedly founded in 753 BC. It survived the kings, the Roman Republic (509 BC\u201327 BC), the Roman Empire (27 BC\u2013395 AD) and the fall of the Western Roman Empire (395\u2013476 AD).\nThe Senate started as an advisory council of elders. The word \"senate\" came from 'senex' meaning \"old man\". The Senate reached its peak in the middle Republic, when it was the most powerful body in Rome. The Senate lost much of its power in the first period of the Empire, known as the \"Principate\".\nAfter Diocletian, when the centre of government was moved out of Rome, the Senate became just a municipal body. The influence of the old idea lived on, and Constantine II set up a Senate in Constantinople.\nFunctions.\nThe Senate passed decrees called \"senatus consultum\", which were advice from the Senate to a magistrate (senior official). They usually were obeyed in practice.\nThrough such advice, the Senate directed the magistrates, especially the Roman Consuls (the chief magistrates) in their handling of military conflicts.\nThe Senate also had power over the civil government in Rome. Only the Senate could authorize paying out public funds from the treasury. As the Roman Empire grew, the Senate also supervised the administration of the provinces, which were governed by former consuls and praetors. It decided which magistrate should govern which province.\nThe senators were patricians, and so members by birth, or men of lesser birth who had notable achievements. Under the early kings, the Senate numbered 100, but grew to 900, then Augustus reduced it to 600. Even so, only about 100 to 200 members were active at any given time. From time to time there were other sources of power in Rome, such as assemblies, magistrates, dictators and emperors, but the Senate always played a part."}

It is widely used in clothing and other textiles. \nDescription.\nThe bulk of a zip consists of two strips of fabric tape, one permanently fixed to each of the two flaps to be joined, and each carrying tens or hundreds of specially shaped metal or plastic teeth. Another part, the slider, which is operated by hand, rides up and down the two sets of teeth. Inside the slider is a Y-shaped channel that pushes the opposing sets of teeth together or apart, depending on the slider's direction of travel. The zip is usually fitted vertically in clothing so that pushing the slider from top to bottom opens it, and pushing it from bottom to top closes it. The friction of the slider against the teeth causes a characteristic buzzing noise which is probably the origin of the name \"zip\".\nHistory.\nAn early device similar to the zip, 'an Automatic, Continuous Clothing Closure', was patented in the USA by Elias Howe in 1851, but did not reach the market. Whitcomb Judson patented a similar 'Clasp Locker', for fastening shoes, in 1891 or 1893, and marketed the invention through his 'Universal Fastener' company. These two designs used hooks and eyes. The design used today, based on interlocking teeth, was invented by an employee of Judson's, Swedish scientist Gideon Sundback, in 1913 as the 'Hookless Fastener' and patented in 1917 as the 'Separable Fastener'. The B. F. Goodrich Company coined the name 'Zipper' in 1923, and used the device on tobacco pouches and boots. The zip became popular for children's clothing and men's trousers in the 1920s and 1930s. At this stage, the zip was permanently joined at one end, so could not be used to fasten jackets."}

The game has received very negative reviews from critics and has been stated as \"one of the worst games of all time\" for \"lame\" weapons in the non-ring levels, overcomplicated controls, and bad graphics.\nGameplay.\nThe player assumes the role of Superman who is challenged to complete many tasks and puzzles throughout the 14 levels in the game. Most of the levels in the game are restricted to two types of gameplay; in some levels, referred to as \"Ride Levels\" in the game's instruction manual, Superman is instructed to fly through a series of hoops by Lex Luthor; in between, he is also tasked to perform certain feats such as battling Luthor's minions, the Dark Shadows, and rescuing civilians from natural or artificial disasters, firstly stopping two cars from trapping civilians.\nIn other levels, referred to as \"Maze Levels\" in the game's instruction manual, Superman has found one of his friends from within one of Luthor's outposts, and must escape with them and defeat a boss. These levels are generally more rooted in action-adventure, and make great use of puzzle-solving. The game's \"virtual Metropolis\" in which these stages take place is filled with what the developers called \"Kryptonite fog\" in an apparent effort by Lex Luthor to diminish Superman's abilities (which is actually distance fog and is used as a technique to mask the game's poor draw distance).\nThe game also includes two multi-player modes (a racing mode and a battle mode) that can be played with up to four people.

{"id": "270716", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=270716", "title": "Roman Kingdom", "text": "The Roman Kingdom () was the monarchical government of the city of Rome and its territories. No written records from that time survive. The histories about it were written during the Republic and Empire and are largely based on legend. Therefore, not much is certain about the history of the Roman Kingdom.\nHowever, the history of the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding, traditionally dated to 753 BC, and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic in about 509 BC.\nBirth.\nWhat eventually became the Roman Empire began as settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in central Italy. The river was navigable up to that place. The site also had a ford where the Tiber could be crossed. The Palatine Hill and hills surrounding it presented easily defensible positions in the wide fertile plain surrounding them. All these features contributed to the success of the city.\nThe traditional account of Roman history is that in Rome's first centuries, it was ruled by a succession of seven kings. The traditional chronology is discounted by modern scholarship. The Gauls destroyed all of Rome's historical records when they sacked the city after the Battle of the Allia in 390 BC or 387/6, so no contemporary records of the kingdom exist. All accounts of the kings must be questioned.\nKings.\nAfter Romulus, who among other things created the Senate, there were, according to legend, six more kings: Numa Pompilius, Tullo Ostilio, Anco Marzio, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. Following Romulus death the Roman Senate was not able to elect a new king and after much debate between Romans and Sabines they agreed to allow the Curiate Assembly to vote in a new king of Rome. They chose Numa Pompilius. Numa, unlike Romulus, was against war and thought the best course for Rome was peace, Numa is credited with bringing religion into the average Roman everyday life.\nThe power of the kings was almost absolute, though the Senate had some influence. There was one big exception: kingship was not hereditary.\nElection of the kings.\nWhenever a king died, Rome entered a period of \"interregnum\". Supreme power of the state would go to the Senate, which was responsible for finding a new king. The Senate would assemble and appoint one of its own members\u2014the interrex\u2014to serve for a period of five days with the sole purpose of nominating the next king of Rome.\nAfter the five-day period, the interrex would appoint (with the Senate's consent) another Senator for another five-day term. This process would continue until a new king was elected. Once the interrex found a suitable nominee to the kingship, he would bring the nominee before the Senate and the Senate would review him. If the Senate passed the nominee, the interrex would convene the Assembly and preside over it during the election of the King.\nOnce proposed to the Assembly, the people of Rome could either accept or reject him. If accepted, the king-elect did not immediately enter office. Two other acts still had to take place before he was invested with the full regal authority and power.\nFirst, it was necessary to obtain the divine will of the gods respecting his appointment by means of the auspices, since the king would serve as high priest of Rome. This ceremony was performed by an augur, who conducted the king-elect to the citadel where he was placed on a stone seat as the people waited below. If found worthy of the kingship, the augur announced that the gods had given favorable tokens, thus confirming the king\u2019s priestly character.\nThe second act which had to be performed was the conferral of the imperium upon the king. The Assembly\u2019s previous vote only determined who was to be king, and had not by that act bestowed the necessary power of the king upon him. Accordingly, the king himself proposed to the Assembly a law granting him imperium, and the Assembly by voting in favor of the law would grant it.\nIn theory, the people of Rome elected their leader, but the Senate had most of the control over the process.\nRomulus.\nRomulus was Rome's first king and the city's founder, the two names are clearly linked. In 753 BC, Romulus began building the city upon the Palatine Hill. After founding and naming (as the story goes) Rome, he permitted men of all classes to come to Rome as citizens, including slaves and freemen without distinction.\nTo provide his citizens with wives, Romulus invited the neighboring tribes to a festival in Rome where he abducted the young women from amongst them (known as the \"Rape of the Sabine Women\"). After the ensuing war with the Sabines, Romulus shared the kingship with the Sabine king Titus Tatius.\nRomulus selected 100 of the best men to form the Roman senate as an advisory council to the king. These men he called \"patres\", and their descendants became the patricians. He also divided the general populace into thirty \"curiae\", named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened to end the war between Romulus and Tatius. The \"curiae\" formed the voting units in the Roman assemblies: \"Comitia Curiata\".\nIn addition to the war with the Sabines and other tribes after the Rape of the Sabine Women, Romulus waged war against the Fidenates and Veientes.\nAfter his death at the age of 54, Romulus was deified as the war god Quirinus and served not only as one of the three major gods of Rome but also as the deified likeness of the city of Rome.\nTarquinius Superbus.\nThe seventh and final king of Rome was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. Tarquinius was of Etruscan birth. It was also during his reign that the Etruscans reached their apex of power. More than other kings before him, Tarquinius used violence, murder, and terrorism to maintain control over Rome. He repealed many of the earlier constitutional reforms of his predecessors.\nA sex scandal brought down the king. Allegedly, Tarquinius allowed his son, Sextus Tarquinius, to rape Lucretia, a patrician Roman. Sextus had threatened Lucretia that if she refused to copulate with him, he would kill a slave, then kill her, and have the bodies discovered together, thus creating a gigantic scandal. Lucretia then told her relatives about the threat, and then committed suicide to avoid any such scandal. Lucretia\u2019s kinsman, Lucius Junius Brutus (ancestor of Marcus Brutus), summoned the Senate and had Tarquinius and the monarchy expelled from Rome in 510 BC.\nEtruscan rule in Rome thus came to a dramatic end in 510 BC, which also signalled the downfall of Etruscan power in Latium.\nLucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, a member of the Tarquin family and Lucretia's widower, went on to become the first consuls of Rome\u2019s new government. This new government would lead the Romans to conquer most of the Mediterranean world and would survive for the next 500 years until the rise of Julius Caesar and Octavian.\nMany years later during the Republican period, this strong Roman opposition to kings was used by the Senate as a rationalization for the murder of the agrarian reformer Tiberius Gracchus."}

It focussed on basic geometric forms such as the square and circle. It is an example of geometric abstraction.\nSuprematism was founded by Kazimir Malevich. In his book \"The Non-Objective World\", published abroad as a Bauhaus Book in 1927, Malevich described the inspiration which brought about the powerful image of the black square on a white ground:\nHe created a suprematist 'grammar' based on fundamental geometric forms; in particular, the square and the circle. In 1915, Malevich exhibited his early experiments in suprematist painting. The centerpiece of his show was the \"Black Square\", placed in what is called the \"red/beautiful corner\" in Russian Orthodox tradition, the place of the main icon in a house. \"Black Square\" was painted in 1915 and was a breakthrough in his career and in art in general. Malevich also painted \"White on White\" which marked a breakthrough from polychrome to monochrome suprematism.\nSome of the titles to paintings in 1915 express the concept of a non-euclidean geometry which imagined forms in movement, or through time; titles such as: \"Two dimensional painted masses in the state of movement.\"\nAssociation.\nThe \"Supremus\" group met from 1915 onwards to discuss the philosophy of suprematism and its development into other areas of life. There was some crossover with constructivism, with suprematists such as Lyuba Popova and especially El Lissitzky working on propaganda and industrial design.\nLissitzky spread suprematist ideas abroad in the early 1920s.\nArchitecture.\nNikolai Suetin used suprematist motifs on works at the St. Petersburg Lomonosov Porcelain Factory where Malevich and Chashnik were also employed, and Malevich designed a suprematist teapot. The suprematists also made architectural models in the 1920s which offered a different conception of socialist buildings to those developed in constructivist architecture.\nMalevich's architectural projects were known after 1922 \"Arkhitektoniki\". Designs emphasized the right angle, with similarities to De Stijl and Le Corbusier, and were justified with an ideological connection to communist governance and equality for all. Another part of the formalism was low regard for triangles which were dismissed as ancient, pagan, or Christian.\nSocial context.\nThis development in artistic expression came about when Russia was in a revolutionary state, ideas were in ferment, and the old order was being swept away. As the new order became established, and Stalinism took hold from 1924 on, the state began limiting the freedom of artists. From the late 1920s the Russian avant-garde experienced direct and harsh criticism from the authorities and in 1934 the doctrine of socialist realism became official policy, and prohibited abstraction and different artistic expression."}

He was born in Ukraine of ethnic Polish parents. who settled near Kiev in Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire during the partitions of Poland. He was a pioneer of geometric abstract art and the originator of the avant-garde Suprematism movement.\nIn March 1913 a major exhibition of Aristarkh Lentulov's paintings opened in Moscow. The effect of this exhibition was comparable with that of Paul C\u00e9zanne in Paris in 1907, as all the main Russian avant-garde artists of the time (including Malevich) immediately absorbed the cubist principles and began using them in their works.\nAlready in the same year the Cubo-Futurist opera \"Victory Over the Sun\" with Malevich's stage-set became a great success. In 1914 Malevich exhibited his works in the \"Salon des Independants\" in Paris.\nSuprematism.\nIn 1915, Malevich laid down the foundations of Suprematism. He published his manifesto \"From Cubism to Suprematism\". In 1916\u20131917 he took part in exhibitions of the \"Jack of Diamonds\" group in Moscow. Famous examples of his Suprematist works were exhibited there, including \"Black Square\" (1915) and \"White on White\" (1918).\nAfter the October Revolution, Malevich became a member of the Collegium on the Arts of \"Narkompros\", the commission for the protection of monuments and the museums commission (all from 1918 to 1919).\nHe taught at the Vitebsk Practical Art School in the USSR (now part of Belarus) (1919\u20131922), the Leningrad Academy of Arts (1922\u20131927), the Kiev State Art Institute (1927\u20131929), and the House of the Arts in Leningrad (1930). He wrote the book \"The World as Non-Objectivity\" (Munich 1926; English trans. 1959) which outlines his Suprematist theories.\nIn 1927 he traveled to Warsaw, and then to Berlin and Munich, for a retrospective exhibition. This finally brought him international recognition.\nMalevich arranged to leave most of the paintings behind when he returned to the Soviet Union, because he could see what was going to happen.\nMalevich thought a shift in attitude of the Soviet authorities towards the modernist art movement would take place after the death of Lenin. This proved correct. In a couple of years the Stalinist regime turned against forms of abstractism, considering them a type of 'bourgeois' art which could not express social reality. As a consequence, many of his works were confiscated and he was banned from creating and exhibiting similar art.\nCritics derided Malevich for \"negating everything good and pure: love of life and love of nature\". Malevich responded that art can advance and develop for art's sake alone, regardless of its pleasure: art does not need us, and it never did.\nMalevich's work only recently reappeared in art exhibitions in Russia after a long absence. Since then art followers have worked to reintroduce the artist to Russian lovers of painting. A book of his theoretical works with an anthology of reminiscences and writings has been published.\nPresent valuation.\nOn 3 November 2008 a work by Malevich entitled \"Suprematist Composition\" from 1916 set the world record for any Russian work of art and any work sold at auction for that year. It sold at Sotheby\u2019s in New York City for just over $60 million U.S. (far surpassing his previous record of $17 million set in 2000).\nSelected works.\n\u2020 Also known as \"Red Square: Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimensions\".&lt;br&gt;\n\u2020\u2020 Also known as \"Black Square and Red Square: Painterly Realism of a Boy with a Knapsack - Color Masses in the Fourth Dimension\"."}

There are 19 species in the genus, with a scattered distribution. They are found in New Caledonia (where 13 species are endemic), Norfolk Island, eastern Australia, New Guinea, Argentina, Chile, and southern Brazil.\nThe present populations are relicts, and of restricted distribution. They are found in forest and shrubland, in exposed sites. These tall trees are living fossils, dating back to early in the Mesozoic era. \nFossil records show that the genus also formerly occurred in the northern hemisphere until the end of the Cretaceous period. By far the greatest diversity exists in New Caledonia, due to the island's long isolation and stability.\nDescription.\nAraucaria are mainly large trees with a massive erect stem, reaching a height of 30\u201380 m. The horizontal, spreading branches grow in whorls and are covered with leathery or needle-like leaves. In some species, the leaves are narrow and shaped like a lance, barely overlapping each other, in others they are broad and flat, and overlap broadly.\nFossil record.\nThe whole group was common in the Jurassic period. The living \"Araucaria araucana\" is often called the monkey-puzzle tree, The whole family Araucariaceae is often called that name by palaeo-botanists. The leaves (pictured here) have an average lifespan of 24 years, and cover most of the tree except for the older branches."}

Red Bull is based on the Thai soda Krating Daeng, which translates as \"Red Bull\". Red Bull is the most popular energy drink/ soda in the world, based on its share of sales. The company was founded by Thai national Chaleo Yoovidhya and Austrian national Dietrich Mateschitz. Chaleo Yoovidhya and his son own 51 percent interest in the company. Mateschitz is responsible for the company's operations through the Austrian company Red Bull GmbH.\nRed Bull's slogan is \"it gives you wings\". The product is strongly marketed through advertising, tournament sponsorship, sports team ownerships, celebrity endorsements, and with its record label. Red Bull sponsors Red Bull Air Race, \"Red Bull Crashed Ice\". It owns the sports team Red Bull Racing, Scuderia Toro Rosso, \"EC Red Bull Salzburg\", \"FC Red Bull Salzburg\", Red Bull New York, and \"RB Leipzig\". Red Bull started its own record label, \"Red Bull Records\".\nIn 2009 it was discovered that Red Bull Cola exported from Austria contained trace amounts of cocaine. Red Bull has also been criticized about the possible health risks of the drink.\nHistory.\nRed Bull took many marketing and ingredient ideas from an energy drink in Thailand called Krating Daeng. Dietrich Mateschitz, an Austrian entrepreneur, developed the Red Bull Energy Drink brand. Mateschitz was the international marketing director for Blendax, a toothpaste company, when he visited Thailand in 1982 and discovered that Krating Daeng helped to cure his jet lag. Between 1984 and 1987, Mateschitz worked with TC Pharmaceutical (a Blendax licensee) to adapt Krating Daeng for the European market.\nAt the same time Mateschitz and Chaleo Yoovidhya founded Red Bull GmbH; each investing $500,000 of savings and taking a stake in the new company. Chaleo and Dietrich each held a 49% share of the new company. They gave the remaining 2% to Chaleo's son Chalerm, but it was agreed that Mateschitz would run the company. The product was launched in 1987, in a carbonated format.\nRed Bull was launched first in Singapore in 1989 followed by Hungary, its second foreign market in 1992. It entered the United States market (via California) in 1997 and the Middle East in 2000. In 2008, \"Forbes\" magazine listed both Chaleo and Mateschitz as being the 260th richest persons in the world with an estimated net worth of $4.0 billion.\nIngredients.\nRed Bull contains taurine, glucuronolactone, caffeine, B vitamins, sucrose and glucose. Red Bull sugar-free also contains phenylalanine in place of sucrose and glucose.\nRed Bull GmbH also manufactures Red Bull Cola, containing the coca leaf, which has sparked a controversy in Germany regarding minute traces of cocaine.\nHealth effects.\nA review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks, including Red Bull, concluding that \"The amounts of guarana, taurine, and ginseng found in popular energy drinks are far below the amounts expected to deliver either therapeutic benefits or adverse events. However, caffeine and sugar are present in amounts known to cause a variety of adverse health effects.\"\nCommonly reported adverse effects due to caffeine used in the quantities present in Red Bull are insomnia, nervousness, headache, and tachycardia (see Caffeine intoxication).\nA 2008 position statement issued by the National Federation of State High School Associations made the following recommendations about energy drink consumption, in general, by young athletes:\nCardiovascular effects.\nThe results of a study conducted in 2008 showed that the ingestion of one, 250mL can of sugar-free Red Bull, in a sample of 30 healthy young adults, had an immediate detrimental effect on both endothelial function, and normal blood coagulation. This temporarily raised the cardiovascular risk in these individuals to a level comparable to that of an individual with established coronary artery disease.\nBased on their results, researchers involved with the study cautioned against the consumption of Red Bull in individuals under stress, in those with high blood pressure, or in anyone with established atherosclerotic disease.\nRed Bull representatives, however, stated that this observed increase in cardiovascular risk was not felt to be different from that associated with drinking a regular cup of coffee. They also stated that they believed that Red Bull must be safe, as it was felt the only way Red Bull could have such substantial global sales is if various health authorities had concluded the drink safe to consume.\nThere has been at least one case report of Red Bull overdose causing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in a young athlete.\nA February 3, 2009 article in \"The Daily Telegraph\" called, \"Red Bull 'may have triggered heart condition that killed student'\"\nreported on the death of a 21 year-old woman who died after drinking four cans of Red Bull as well as alcohol at \"social levels\". It was believed, but had not been proven, that she suffered from a rare heart condition called long QT Syndrome. She was on medication for epilepsy. A medical examination found that there were no illegal drugs in her system. The article quoted a doctor as saying, \"The QT levels may have grown over a few years, or it may have been artificially pushed over the limit by caffeine\".\nCocaine controversy.\nIn April and June 2009, batches of \"Red Bull Cola\" drinks imported from Austria were found to contain between 0.1 - 0.3 micrograms of cocaine per litre, according to Hong Kong officials. In Taiwan it was found that the importer was due to launch a marketing campaign the next day. Importing cocaine to the island is an offense that is punishable by death or a life sentence in prison. In Germany, 11 out of 16 states had already banned the drinks by May 25, 2009.\nTesting of Red Bull Energy Drink and its variations has shown that a person with a low tolerance for cocaine would have to consume two million cans of the drink in a single sitting before becoming critically ill from the cocaine. However, this finding is legally irrelevant since distribution of cocaine is illegal in any quantity in Taiwan. At this point, no further action has been taken on the matter in Taiwan.\nRed Bull's claims.\nRed Bull claims to:\nCaffeine content.\nRed Bull's invigorating effects are attributed to its high caffeine content. A single can of Red Bull contains 80\u00a0mg/250\u00a0ml of caffeine. This is about the same as one cup of normal coffee, or slightly less depending on the brewing method The actual caffeine level in Red Bull can vary depending on country, as some countries have legal restrictions on how much caffeine is allowed in drinks.\nRed Bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of caffeine.\nLegal status.\nRed Bull has been subject to bans in France, Denmark and Norway. The ban has been lifted in Norway and Denmark. The French ban was challenged by the European Commission and (partially) upheld by the European Court of Justice in 2004.\nRed Bull brand of sport asia dominate for first pumptrack league national to gear apparel by dream team in company figures supports.\nAdvertising.\nRed Bull has an aggressive international marketing campaign. The numerous sponsored activities range from extreme sports like windsurfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, kayaking, wakeboarding, cliff-diving, surfing, skating, freestyle motocross, rally, Formula 1 racing, and breakdancing to art shows, music, and video games. In keeping with their target market of young males, Red Bull has also enlisted help from celebrities, such as Eminem that would appeal to this group (sponsoring the Red Bull \"EmSee Battle Rap championships\"). It also hosts events like the \"Red Bull Flugtag\" (German for \"flight day\" or \"flying day\") and other such contests. Red Bull also sponsors association football teams, with clubs in Austria, Germany, the United States and Brazil featuring the Red Bull trademark in their names. By associating the drink's image with these activities, the company seeks to promote a \"cool\" public image and raise brand power. In addition, the slender container is used to suggest a \"sexier\" image than some other cola counterparts. Hence, this one energy drink has helped create a market for over 150 related types of merchandise, like Red Rooster and Blue Lightning.\nRed Bull's slogan, \"it gives you wings\", is widely used in these marketing activities. Claims about the drink's effects and performance have been challenged on various occasions, with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority imposing advertising restrictions in 2001 in response to complaints first recorded as early as 1997. Even with all of the concerns regarding Red Bull, in 2000 the corporation earned around $1 billion in worldwide sales and Red Bull held 65% of the market share.\nIn the PlayStation 3's new social app, PlayStation Home, Red Bull has developed its own in-game island, specifically advertising its energy drink and the Red Bull Air Race event. In late November 2009, Red Bull brought out two new spaces, the Red Bull Illume space, and the Red Bull Beach space featuring the Red Bull Flugtag, both released on the same day.\nIn the video game \"Worms 3D\", Red Bull could be drunk by the worms, giving them the effect of faster movement.\nRed Bull is displayed on virtual track-side billboards during gameplay and in the opening cinematic in the video game \"Wipeout XL\".\nEndorsements.\nIn 2009, Red Bull added mainstream sport athletes to its roster of sports endorsements. Reggie Bush was the first NFL athlete to endorse the product. The announcement was made at the Super Bowl."}

They were the first macropods to be seen by Europeans. Francisco Pelsaert, captain of the Batavia, saw them when the ship was wrecked on the Abrolhos Islands in 1629. He said they looked like hopping cats. There are three sub-species of tammar wallaby:\nThe name tammar comes from the word \"tamma\", meaning sheoak. The wallaby lives under sheoak plants.\nTammar wallabies became extinct on mainland South Australia in the 1930's. Extinction has been caused by habitat destruction, hunting, and foxes. In 1998 a small population of South Australian wallabies was found living on Kawau Island near Auckland, in New Zealand. This group had been established by former South Australian governor, Sir George Grey in 1862 as part of his own private zoo. In New Zealand these wallabies were seen as a pest, and scientists have been studying ways to get rid of them. 85 wallabies were taken back to South Australia. After extensive fox controls at Innes National Park, 10 wallabies were released in November 2004. Another 36 were released in June 2005. These first releases were tracked with radio collars. Another group has been put into a captive breeding program at Monarto Zoo.\nTammar wallabies live in thick scrub during the day and come out into grassland to feed at night. They eat mainly grass and herbs. In dry areas they have been known to survive by drinking seawater. They range over an area of about .\nThey are about in height, with a dark grey brown fur. They have reddish colour on their arms and sides, with pale grey fur on their bellies. They may also have a feint white line on their cheeks.\nThe wallabies have a very unusual breeding pattern. The fertilized eggs remain dormant inside the mother until the summer solstice when foetal development restarts. This is called \"embryonic diapause\". All the young are born on the same day about 31 days later, at the end of January or the beginning of February.\nThe tammar wallaby is the marsupial chosen for the genome sequencing project. Scientists are studying the milk from the wallaby as they think it might contain a new and powerful antibiotic."}

The Roman emperor Antoninus Pius built the wall to control barbarians: the ancient Britons to the north of the wall, in Caledonia. The wall is now in Scotland, and runs between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde in the modern Scottish Lowlands. When the Romans built the wall, it was the northern border of the Roman Empire.\nThe Roman legions (armies) of the governor of Roman Britain, Lollius Urbicus, built the wall for the emperor between 139 and 142. The wall was about long. Its foundations were made of stone and was between and wide. The wall itself was made of turf. In front of the wall (on the northern side) was a ditch. The ditch was away from the wall. The ditch was at least deep and was nearly wide in places. The Romans used the wall until after 158. The last Romans went away from the wall in around 163. After that, the wall fell into ruins slowly.\nThe Antonine Wall is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Frontiers of the Roman Empire. It shares this listing with Hadrian's Wall in England and the German fortifications known as the \"Limes Germanicus\". The barrier was the second of two \"great walls\" created by the Romans in Great Britain. Its ruins are less visible than the better known Hadrian's Wall to the south.\nConstruction began in AD 142 at the order of emperor Antoninus Pius, and took about twelve years to complete. Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus Pius to send the empire's troops farther north. The wall was protected by sixteen forts with a number of small fortlets between them; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way. The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the barbarians in a number of decorative slabs, twenty of which still survive.\nDespite this good start, the wall was abandoned after only twenty years. The garrisons were sent back to Hadrian's Wall. In 208 the emperor Septimius Severus re-established legions at the wall and ordered repairs. This has led to the wall being referred to as the Severan Wall. However, this occupation ended only a few years later, and the wall was never fortified again. Most of the wall and its associated fortifications have been destroyed over time, but some remains are still visible. Many of these have come under the care of Historic Scotland and the UNESCO World Heritage Site Committee. Most of the wall is private property."}

Its route was unusual, because despite its length it went nowhere near London. It went directly from the south-west coast to the midland east coast. It linked Exeter (\"Isca Dumnoniorum\") in South West England to Lincoln (\"Lindum Colonia\") in the East Midlands. The road went via Ilchester (\"Lindinis\"), Bath (\"Aquae Sulis\"), Cirencester (\"Corinium\") and Leicester (\"Ratae Corieltauvorum\").\nIt joined Akeman Street and Ermin Way at Cirencester, crossed Watling Street at \"Venonis\" (High Cross) south of Leicester, and joined Ermine Street at Lincoln.\nThe word \"Fosse\" is derived from the Latin \"fossa\", meaning \"ditch\". For the first few decades after the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43, the Fosse Way marked the western frontier of Roman rule in Iron Age Britain. It is possible that the road began as a defensive ditch that was later filled in and converted into a road, or possibly a defensive ditch ran alongside the road for at least some of its length.\nIt is remarkable for its extremely direct route. From Lincoln to Ilchester in Somerset is a distance of 182 miles. The road is never more than six miles from a straight line.\nPlace names with words like -cester or -chester are derived from the Latin \"castra\", meaning 'military camp'. 'Street' is derived from the Latin \"strata\", meaning a paved road.\nFosse Way still exists. In places it is a major road, in others a country path. The A46 between Lincoln and Leicester is on the Fosse Way. From Bath to Ilchester the A37 follows the Fosse, and from Ilchester to Exeter the A30/A303 roads follow the Fosse for the most part.\nThe Roman road is, quite simply, the shortest route possible."}

However, as both Calment and Izumi are debunked or possibly disputed, Mortensen was the fifth oldest person in history at the time of his death (behind Canadianwoman Marie-Louise Meilleur who died just nine days earlier, Americanwoman Sarah Knauss who then was the oldest living person, Japanesewoman Tane Ikai and Americanwoman Maggie Barnes who died less than 14 weeks earlier), the only man who became 115 years old (before Emiliano Mercado del Toro's 115th birthday on 21 August 2006) and the oldest man ever though until December 27, 2012 whereafter his record was broken by Japaneseman Jiroemon Kimura (who was the third man to become 115 years old as well as the only man to become 116 years old).\nMortensen was baptised in Fruering Church on December 26, 1882. Besides his baptismal record, other records include the 1890 and 1901 census enumerations in Denmark, and church confirmation in 1896."}

This art is not meant to depict our everyday visual world, but instead uses the shapes of basic geometry.\nWassily Kandinsky, one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting, was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work. Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting.\nGeometric abstraction is not just an invention of 20th century avant-garde artists or movements. It is present in many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves. \nIslamic art, in its prohibition of depicting religious figures, is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art. It existed centuries before the modern movement in Europe, and in many ways influenced this Western school. Geometric patterns were often used in the architecture of Islamic civilisations from the 7th century-20th century, to visually connect spirituality with science and art. \nAbstract art has also historically been likened to music in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality. Wassily Kandinsky has discussed this connection between music and painting, as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work, at length in his seminal essay \"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\".\nExpressionist abstract painting, as practiced by artists such as Jackson Pollock, is the opposite of geometric abstraction. \nArtists who have worked extensively in geometric abstraction include Josef Albers, Theo van Doesburg, Wassily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland, Bridget Riley, Alexander Rodchenko, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, among others."}

His work in Europe and the United States was highly influential and far-reaching. His ideas formed the basis of many art education programs in the 20th century.\nLife.\nAlbers was born in Bottrop, Westphalia, Germany. He studied art in Berlin, Essen, and Munich, before enrolling as a student at the prestigious Weimar Bauhaus in 1920. He began teaching in the preliminary course of the Department of Design in 1922, and was promoted to Professor in 1925, the year the Bauhaus moved to Dessau. His work at this time included designing furniture and working with glass.\nWith the closure of the Bauhaus under Nazi pressure in 1933, Albers emigrated to the United States. In 1950 Albers was appointed head of the Department of Design at Yale University. In 1963 he published \"Interaction of color\" which presented his theory that colors were governed by an internal and deceptive logic. A key idea, which he proved by examples, was that our perception of color is not constant. It is influenced by the juxtaposition (placing together) of one color with another. This interested artists interested in optical illusions (Op art).\nAlbers is best remembered for his work as an abstract painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series \"Homage to the Square\". In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged inside each other. This was a union of geometric abstraction with experiments in color."}

Since the 1860s, these two main parties have been the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has the most seats in the House of Representatives while the Republicans and Democrats split the Senate at 50 Senators each. The Vice President, a Democrat, holds a tie breaking vote, in the United States Senate.\nThe United States has only two major political parties: the Democrats and the Republicans. There are also smaller parties that aren\u2019t as well known. These major parties have a duopoly, meaning that they share almost all the political power in the country. Most constitutional republic countries have more than two parties.\nThe three largest parties aside from the two main political parties are the Libertarian Party, Green Party of the United States, and the Constitution Party in respective order.\nDemocratic Party.\nThe Democratic Party was started in 1828 as a pro-slavery party and the first President was Andrew Jackson in 1829. However, through the economic resurgence after the Great Depression in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the Democratic party became a proponent of racial equality. Many 20th century United States Presidents such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and 21st century presidents such as Barack Obama and Joe Biden are Democrats. They have 48 out of 100 seats in the U.S. Senate (independents caucusing with the democratic party hold two seats in the U.S. senate) and 222 out of 435 seats in the House of Representatives. 24 out of 50 state governors are also Democrats. The party generally promotes liberalism and is often classed as a center-left to left-wing party. Currently, the party has 60 million registered voters across America. \nThe party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality. It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, anti-gun laws, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy.\nRepublican Party.\nThe Republican Party was started in 1854 as an anti-slavery party and its first President was Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Others include Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump. In the Nixon years, there was a shift to appeal to the implicit racial biases of white voters that did not like the civil rights movement of the 1960's in what is called The Southern Strategy. This strategy created the appearance of equity while ignoring minorities in the process. 26 out of 50 states have a Republican governor. It has around 55 million registered voters across America. Currently, the Republican Party is identified as conservative.\nThe party philosophy centers around social and economic independence, and a capitalist economic system. It is also known for its anti-abortion efforts, pro-gun laws, anti-regulatory policy, and reduction of government intervention in the economy as well as being in support of privatized health care. The party believes in lower taxes, less social programs, and personal liberty.\nIndependents.\nDespite the general attractiveness to the two party system of Republicans and Democrats in America, as many as 44% of politically active citizens prefer to identify as Independent. It is less common to achieve political influence in modern government functions, but some lawmakers such as Joe Lieberman may retire their parties with their careers.\nFamous examples include:\n1st President: George Washington \nPresidential Candidate: Evan McMullin (2016)\nPresidential Candidate: Ross Perot (1992)\nSenator and Presidential Candidate: Bernie Sanders (Caucasus with Democratic Party)\nSee also.\nList of presidents of the United States\nReferences.\n4. https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx "}

After the collapse of Hippias' tyranny, Isagoras and Cleisthenes were rivals for power. Isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the Spartan king Cleomenes I to help him expel Cleisthenes.\nSo Cleisthenes left Athens as an exile, and Isagoras held power in the city.

In English Death is usually given the name Grim Reaper and from the 15th century to now, the Grim Reaper is shown as a human skeleton holding a scythe and clothed with a black cloak with a hood. It is also given the name of Angel of Death (, Mal'ach Ha'Mavett), that appeared in the Bible.\nIn some beliefs, the Grim Reaper can cause the death of the victim, that created legends that he can be bribed, tricked and make deals to keep the life of someone. In other beliefs, the Grim Reaper guides the dead to the next world, without the knowing of the dead about his death.\nIndo-European Mythology.\nAncient Greek.\nIn Ancient Greek, the Greeks saw death as good. He is often shown as a bearded, winged man or a young, winged, boy. Death, or Thanatos, is the opposite of Life. Death is represented as a male, and life as a female. He is the twin brother of Hypnos, the god of Sleep.He is discripted as gentle, he escorts the dead to the Underworld, Hades.Then he hands the dead to Charon, who mans a boat that carries the dead to the underworld, through the river Styx. Thanatos' sisters, Keres, were the spirits of violent death, they were connected with deaths from battle, disease, accident, and murder. They were portrayed as evil, they were feeding on the body of the dead, after the soul was escorted to the Hades. They had fangs, talons, and would be dressed in bloody jewels.\nRoman.\nIn Ancient Roman mythology, Death was known as \"Mors\", of which was the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Thanatos and the Hindu goddess Mara. Though the Latin noun for \"death\", \"mors\", is of feminine gender, the surviving ancient Roman art is not known to depict Death as a woman.\nCeltic.\nThe Welsh portrayed death as Angeu, and for the Bretons it was Ankou, they were the same one. He appeared as a man with a black robe, sometimes carrying a scythe, riding a cart which he collected the dead on it.\nIn Scottish folklore there was a belief that a mystic black, dark green or white dog known as \"C\u00f9 S\u00ecth\" took dying souls to the afterlife. Comparable figures also exist in Irish and Welsh stories.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, Death, or \"\u015amier\u0107\", has an appearance that is similar to the our modern Grim Reaper, but instead of a black robe, he wears a White robe.\nBaltic.\nLithuanians call death \"Giltin\u0117\", from the word \"gelti\" (to sting). Giltin\u0117 was shown as an old, ugly, woman with a long blue nose and a poisonous tongue. The legend tells that Giltin\u0117 was young, pretty and communicative until she was trapped in a coffin for seven years. The goddess of death was a sister of the goddess of life and destiny, \"Laima\", symbolizing the relationship between beginning and end.\nLatvians named Death \"Ve\u013cu m\u0101te\", from a word meaning \"mother\".\nAfter it, the Lituanians and Latvians adopted the classical Grim Reaper with the black cloak and the scythe.\nHindu Texts.\nIn Hindu texts, the lord of death is called Yama. Yama rides a black buffalo and carries a rope to take the dead to his prison. There are many form of Reapers, they are his agents. They are called \"Yamaduts\". There, all the man good and bad are stored in an kind of archive. Then Yama take the records out and decides where the soul will be set in the next life, according to the Reincarnation of Hinduism. Yama is also mentioned in the Mahabharata as a philosopher and a devotee of Brahman.\nLatin American folklore.\nOur Lady of the Holy Death (\"Santa Muerte\") is a female deity or folk saint of Mexican folk religion, whose popularity has been growing in Mexico and the United States in recent years. La Calavera Catrina, a character symbolizing death, is also an icon of the Mexican Day of the Dead.\nMeitei Manipuri mythology.\nIn Meitei mythology, death is personified with multiple deities, including Thongalel, the ruler of the underworld and the god of the death, along with his wives. In the underworld kingdom, he administers the souls of the death, either to resend them or to bring a new one to and from the human world. At these tasks, he is assisted by Thongak Lairembi and Khamnung Kikoi Louonbi. The underworld kingdom is called \"Khamnung kingdom\" and its capital city, \"Khamnung Sawa\" is in the middle of the river \"Ashi Turel\", which has only a single bridge made up of a thread. This should be crossed over by only those souls who do not commit suicide during their earthly life. Else, one has to struck over inside the underworld kingdom but outside the capital city \"Khamnung Sawa\", which is, of course, a painstaking life too for the souls.\nJapanese mythology.\nIn the Kojiki, after giving birth to the fire god, \"Kagu-tsuchi\", Izanami dies from wounds of its fire and enters the perpetual night realm called Yomi-no-kuni (the underworld) that the gods retire to and where Izanagi, her husband, travels to in a failed attempt to reclaim her. He discovers his wife as not-so beautiful anymore, and, in a brief argument afterwards between them, she promises to take a thousand lives every day, signifying her position as the goddess of death. \nThere are also death gods called \"shinigami\" (\u6b7b\u795e, \"death gods\", \"death spirits\"), which are closer to the Western tradition of the Grim Reaper; while common in modern Japanese arts and fiction, they were essentially absent in traditional mythology.\nIn Abrahamic Religions.\nMemitim.\nMemitim is a type of angel from the Bible that is connected to the death of the humans. The words is from the Hebrew language \u05de\u05de\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd (English:Killers). They are mentioned to kill the people that their guardian angel no longer protects them. There is some debate about the nature of the Memitim among biblical scholars, but it is accepted that, as described in the Book of Job 33:22, they are killers of some kind.\nJudaism.\nForm and functions.\nAccording to the Midrash, the Angel of Death was created by God in the first day of the creation. His house is in Heaven.He has twelve wings.\"Over all people have I surrendered thee the power,\" said God to the Angel of Death, \"only not over this one which has received freedom from death through the Law\".It said that the angel of death is full of eyes. In the time of the death, he stands over the dying one, and waiting for the man to see him. When the dying finally sees him, he drops a gall to the dying's mouth and that is what kills him finally The expression \"to taste of death\" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall.\nDeath and Satan.\nThe Angel of Death, who is identified by some with Satan, right after the creation has a dispute with God about the light of the Messiah. When Eve touched the tree of knowledge, the Angel of Death talked to her, and she thought:\"Now I shall die, and God will create another wife for Adam\". Adam also talked to the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death sits before the face of the dead. While Abraham was mourning, for Sarah the angel appeared to him, which explains why \"Abraham stood up from before his death\". Samael told Sarah that Abraham had sacrificed Isaac in spite of his wailing, and Sarah died of horror and grief. It was Moses who most often had dealings with the angel. At the resistance of Korah, Moses saw him.\nIslam.\nIn Islam there is the Archangel of Death, named Azrael. In the Qur'an, he is not mentioned by this name, but by \"Mal'akkh al Mut\" (Arabic: \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a, \"Angel of Death\"). He is also descripted in old Hebrew texts as Azrael, the Angel of Death. He is also called Azrael in early Christian texts."}

The movie stars Charlton Heston and features Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly, and Linda Harrison. It was released by 20th Century Fox.\nPlot.\nThe film's story is about an astronaut crew who leave Earth on a deep space mission and crash land on a supposedly alien planet in the 40th century. Ony three out of the four crew members survive the crash and the survivors find the world to be home to a society of apes; including chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. These apes have the intelligence of human beings as well as the ability to speak and walk upright like humans. Humans in this society are treated like slaves and live in the wilderness without the ability to speak. At the end of the movie, one of the crew members finds the Statue of Liberty and realizes they were on Earth all along.\nReception and influence.\nPlanet of the Apes was a box office success, meaning it earned a good amount of money and got highly favourable reviews from critics. The movie was given praise for exploring ideas such as class differences, religion, slavery, racism, and nuclear technology. It was followed by four sequels: \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970), \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes\" (1971), \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\" (1972), and \"Battle for the Planet of the Apes\" (1973). A live action television show was shown in 1974 and an animated television show called \"Return to the Planet of the Apes\" came out in 1975. The animated cartoon The Fairly Oddparents episode Abra-Catastrophe has a segment where humans are slave cavemen and the apes are their overlords. \nIn 2001, a remake of the movie was made directed by Tim Burton and starred Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth. In August 2011, the series was rebooted with \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\". This was followed in 2014 with \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" with a 2017 sequel released \"War of the Planet of the Apes\"."}

Whether or not the law says that a business is \"small\" is different in different countries and industries.\nSmall businesses are common in many countries. Some examples include: convenience stores, other small shops (such as a bakery), hairdressers, tradesmen, lawyers, accountants, restaurants, guest houses, photographers, small-scale manufacturing, and online business, such as web design and programming.\nGood things about small business.\nA small business can be started at a very low cost. It also does not need to be open all the time.\nIndependence is another good thing about owning a small business. Being able to operate by themselves is a good thing for small business owners. Small business owners can make their own decisions about what they want to do with their company. However, entrepreneurs often must work very long hours and understand that their customers are their bosses.\nMany organizations in the United States also give help to small businesses, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource.\nProblems for small businesses.\nSmall businesses often face a lot of problems because of their size.\nIn the United States, some of the largest concerns of small business owners are insurance costs, high energy costs and taxes.\nAnother problem for several small businesses is the fact that much larger businesses can influence their chances for success."}

Many of the works, sometimes called installations, may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.

Joseph Kosuth elevated this into a definition of art itself in his early manifesto of conceptual art. \nThe notion that art should examine its own nature was already part of art critic Clement Greenberg's vision of modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists began a far more radical analysis of art than was previously done. One of the first things they questioned was the assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.\nConceptual art has come to mean all contemporary art which does not use the traditional skills of painting and sculpture."}

In a loose collection the center of mass may be in space, as it is in the Solar System. Also, as planets' orbits change slightly, so will the position of the barycenter.\nA simple way to understand the concept of barycenter is to push a supermarket trolley. If you hold only one corner and push, it will only go in a straight line when you push through the centre of mass. Otherwise a turning force is created. This shows that the mass acts as if it were only in one place.\nThe center of gravity is a closely related term. It is the point where an object can be balanced perfectly by a sharp point holding it up under the object. It is the center of mass acting in a gravitational field.\nHistory.\nThe concept of center of mass was first introduced by the ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer Archimedes of Syracuse. Archimedes showed that the torque (turning force) exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point \u2014 their center of mass. \nArchimedes was the first person to work out ways of finding the center of mass in various objects.\nRelation between the two terms.\nThe center of mass is often called the \"center of gravity\" because any uniform gravitational field g acts on a system as if the mass \"M\" of the system were concentrated at the center of mass R."}

He advised modern art collectors, such as Peggy Guggenheim and other prominent figures, thereby helping to shape the tastes of Western art during this period.\nA playful man, Duchamp challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and art marketing, not so much by writing, but through subversive actions such as dubbing a urinal art and naming it \"Fountain\". This approach would 50 years later be called conceptual art, though he himself used the term 'ready-mades' for this idea. He produced relatively few artworks, while moving quickly through the avant-garde circles of his time.\nThe creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.\nDuchamp and chess.\nUpon his return to Paris in 1923, Duchamp was, in essence, no longer a practicing artist. Instead, he played chess, which he studied for the rest of his life to the exclusion of most other activities.\nDuchamp can be seen, very briefly, playing chess with Man Ray in the short film \"Entr'acte\" (1924) by Ren\u00e9 Clair. During this period his fascination with chess so distressed his first wife that she glued his pieces to the board. Duchamp continued to play in the French Championships and also in the Chess Olympiads from 1928\u20131933, favoring hypermodern openings such as the Nimzo-Indian."}

These two teams wanted to make a better junior league for the province, so combined teams from their leagues. Eight teams were from the QJHL and two from the MMJHL and another team came from a town in Ontario on the Ontario-Quebec border. Nearly every team was within a close distance of Montreal, the largest city in Quebec, though no team played in Montreal.\nIn 1972 the QMJHL finally wanted a team in Montreal, and tried to get the Montreal Junior Canadiens, who played in the Ontario Hockey Association, to join. The OHA made a deal with the QMJHL and gave them the Junior Canadiens while creating a new team in a different city to keep an OHA team with the same name."}

She married her cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikailovich of Russia and had seven children. During her brother's reign, she lived a private life. However, when monarchy fell, she escaped Russia and lived in England.\nEarly life.\nGrand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna was born on 6 April 1875 at Anichkov Palace in St. Petersburg. Her mother was Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia.\nAfter her grandfather died, her father became the Russian king. At this time, Xenia was six years old. It was difficult political time because of terrorist threats. Alexander III moved with his family from the Winter Palace to the Gatchina Palace to protect his family.\nXenia, like her brothers, was educated by private tutors. She studied foreign languages very much. Apart from her native Russian, Xenia studied English, French, and German. Xenia also learnt how to cook and make puppets and clothes. She liked to ride, fish, draw, play gymnastics, dance, and perform the piano.\nMarriage.\nXenia and her first cousin once removed, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, who would also be her husband, used to play together as friends in the 1880s. Alexander was also a friend of her brother Nicholas. In 1886, twenty year old Alexander was in the navy. Eleven year old Xenia sent him a card when his ship was in Brazil, \"Best wishes and speedy return! Your sailor Xenia\". In 1889, Alexander wrote of Xenia, \"She is fourteen. I think she likes me.\"\nAt age 15, though Xenia and Alexander wanted to marry, her parents did not want to allow them because Xenia was too young. They were also unsure if Alexander was really very nice. The Tsarina Maria Feodorovna complained that Alexander was too proud and rude. It was not until January 1894 that Xenia's parents allowed them to engage. The couple finally wed on 6 August 1894 at Peterhof Palace. Xenia's younger sister, Olga, wrote about the joy of her the wedding, \"The Emperor was so happy. It was the last time I ever saw him like that.\""}

{"id": "271477", "revid": "7855885", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271477", "title": "Battle of Marathon", "text": " \nThe Battle of Marathon took place in September 490 BC on the plain of Marathon. It was fought between the Athenians and the Persians. Athens was supported by a small force from the city of Plataea. The battle was the end of the first attempt by Persia, under King Darius I, to conquer Greece. It was part of the first Greco-Persian war.\nThe Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt. Then, Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia, who were trying to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis, but were forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn Athens and Eretria to the ground.\nPersian invasion.\nOnce the Ionian revolt was crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade, Darius began planning to conquer Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean, to subjugate the Cyclades, the group of Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. The next step was to attack Athens and Eretria. After a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians defeated, captured and burnt Eretria. \"/\nThe Persian force then sailed for Attica. They landed on Schinias beach on the east end of Marathon bay. The broad field, called the plain of Marathon, was flat, level and ideal for battle. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and blocked the two exits from the plain of Marathon. Stalemate ensued for five days. Then, for reasons that are not clear, the Athenians decided to attack the Persians. Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the Greek hoplites proved very effective against the more lightly armed Persian infantry. They routed the Persian wings before turning in on the centre of the Persian line.\nConsequences.\nThe defeat at Marathon was a decisive victory that marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Persian force retreated to Asia. Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece. However, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, postponing any Greek expedition. After Darius died, his son Xerxes I restarted the preparations for a second invasion of Greece, which finally began in 480 BC.\nThe Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten. The eventual Greek triumph in these wars began at Marathon. The next two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization, which has been so influential in western society. This is why the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a key moment in European history.\nJohn Stuart Mill suggested that \"the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the Battle of Hastings\". The Battle of Marathon is perhaps now more famous as the inspiration for the Marathon race. Although historically inaccurate, the legend of a Greek messenger running to Athens with news of the victory became the inspiration for this athletic event, introduced at the 1896 Athens Olympics, and originally run between Marathon and Athens.\nBattle.\nWhen the Athenian line was ready, according to one source, the simple signal to advance was given by Miltiades: \"At them\".p191 Most likely, they marched until they reached the limit of the archers' effectiveness, the \"beaten zone\", (roughly 200 meters), and then broke into a run towards their enemy.p66 Herodotus suggests that this was the first time a Greek army ran into battle in this way; this was probably because it was the first time that a Greek army had faced an enemy composed mainly of missile troops (archers, spear-throwers).\nAll this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians. Passing through the hail of arrows, protected for the most part by their armour, the Greek line finally collided with the enemy army. Holland provides an evocative description: \n\"The enemy directly in their path...realised to their horror that [the Athenians], far from providing the easy pickings for their bowmen, as they had first imagined, were not going to be halted...The impact was devastating. The Athenians had honed their style of fighting in combat with other phalanxes, wooden shields smashing against wooden shields, iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronze...in those first terrible seconds of collision, there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into flesh and bone; then the rolling of the Athenian tide over men wearing, at most, quilted jerkins for protection, and armed, perhaps, with nothing more than bows or slings. The hoplites' ash spears, rather than shivering...could instead stab and stab again, and those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing men of bronze.\"194\u2013197\nThe Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies (conscripted troops) on the flanks, before turning inwards to surround the Persian centre, which had been more successful against the thin Greek centre. The battle ended when the Persian centre then broke in panic towards their ships, pursued by the Greeks. Some, unaware of the local terrain, ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned.p71 The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships, and managed to capture seven ships, though most were able to launch.\nHerodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield. It is unknown how many more died in the swamps. The Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11."}

Their brains were slightly larger than the average human's is today.\nNaming.\nThe name \"Cro-Magnon\" was created by Louis Lartet, who discovered the first Cro-Magnon skull in southwestern France in 1868. He called the place where he found the skull \"Abri de Cro-Magnon.\" \"Abri\" means \"rock shelter\" in French; \"cro\" means \"hole\" in the Occitan language; and \"Magnon\" was the name of the person who owned the land where Lartet found the skull. Basically, Cro-Magnon means \"rock shelter in a hole on Magnon's land.\"\nThis is why scientists now use the term \"European early modern humans\" instead of \"Cro-Magnons.\" In taxonomy, the term \"Cro-Magnon\" means nothing.\nCro-Magnon life.\nLike most early humans, the Cro-Magnons mostly hunted large animals. For example, they killed mammoths, cave bears, horses, and reindeer for food. They hunted with spears, javelins, and spear-throwers. They also ate fruits from plants.\nThe Cro-Magnons were nomadic or semi-nomadic. This means that instead of living in just one place, they followed the migration of the animals they wanted to hunt. They may have built hunting camps from mammoth bones; some of these camps were found in a village in Ukraine. They also made shelters from rocks, clay, tree branches, and animal skin (leather)."}

In general, cheating is breaking the rules to get an unfair advantage. In video games, a player usually cheats to make the game easier.\nThese kind of advantages can often be activated by entering codes. A set of cheat codes may have been written into the game's programming by the game's developers. When entered, a code activates a corresponding advantage. Cheat codes can also be created by added software, called a game trainer. Players can also cheat by taking advantage of software bugs in the game.\nCheat codes makes the system do things that are not normal. For example, pressing a certain sequence of buttons may increase a character's hit points in an role-playing game, or make a car drive faster in a racing game.\nAnother way of cheating is using applications called \"exploits.\" It usually involves injecting DLLs in the game application for access to advantages."}

Since only female mammals make milk, weaning is only a necessary process for mammals. When a baby does not drink any more breast milk (or milk substitute), the baby has been weaned.\nHuman weaning.\nHuman babies should start eating small amounts of solid food, along with breast milk or formula, when they are about six months old. Before this time, a child's digestive system and kidneys are still forming, so the child is not ready for solid food.\nBabies do not have teeth and cannot chew their food, so they are usually fed soft, runny food such as cooked mashed fruit or vegetables. Babies cannot digest some foods which adults can eat, including food with nuts or with large amounts of gluten, salt or sugar. Also, babies' digestive systems are very sensitive to bacteria, so they should not eat any foods with honey, eggs or shellfish in them because these foods sometimes contain bacteria.\nWeaning conflict.\nWeaning conflict happens when the mother wants to wean her baby, but the baby wants to keep breastfeeding. The mother tries to force the baby to stop breastfeeding, and the baby tries to force the mother to continue. Some evolutionary scientists think mammal mothers need to wean their babies as soon as possible, so they will have a greater chance of having more babies and spreading their genes. But mammal babies want to breastfeed as long as they can so they will have a chance to grow strong, and also to enjoy the full care of their mothers. Weaning conflict happens in several mammal species, including primates and canines."}

He is the WBA heavyweight champion and is nicknamed \"The Hayemaker\". He is 1.91 metres (6 feet 3\u00a0inches) tall. Before he became a heavyweight, he boxed in the cruiserweight division, where he held all the major titles. His most famous cruiserweight fights were against Jean-Marc Mormeck and Enzo Maccarinell. He has lost only once in his career.\nHaye moved up to the heavyweight division and beat Monte Barrett in 2008. In October 2009, he beat Nikolai Valuev, who is 7 feet tall, to become the WBA champion. In 2010, he beat John Ruiz. He defended his title against fellow Briton Audley Harrison in November 2010.\nCareer.\nHaye started his career as an amateur. He reached the finals of the 2001 world amateur championship in the heavyweight class, where he lost to Odlanier Solis. He turned professional in the cruiserweight division in December 2002. His first professional fight was meant to be against Valeri Semishkur, but Semishkur pulled out. Instead, Haye fought and beat Tony Booth on 8 December 2002. He had seven fights in 2003, and won all of them. He won his tenth fight in a row when he beat Arthur Williams on 12 May 2004. He won those ten fights with a total of only 20 rounds. In his match against IBO champion Carl Thompson on 10 September 2004, he lost for the first time in his career. In his next match, on 10 December 2004, he beat Semishkur in the first round.\nHaye won the European title on 16 December 2006 when he beat Alexander Gurov. He won the match after only 45 seconds. On 24 March 2007, in his first match as European champion, he beat Lasse Johansen. On 27 April 2007, he had his first heavyweight fight, against Tomasz Bonin. Haye won in the first round. Shortly after the fight, Haye said he had plans to move up to the heavyweight division. \"I'm absolutely certain I can rule the heavyweight roost\", he said. On 10 November 2007, he beat Jean-Marc Mormeck to win the WBA, WBC, and \"Ring\" magazine titles. Haye was knocked down in the fourth round, but hit Mormeck with a series of blows in the seventh to win by technical knockout. He became the UK's sixth boxing champion. On 8 March 2008, he beat Enzo Maccarinelli to win the WBO title. Haye hit Maccarinelli with two big punches before the referee stopped the match. Haye said he planned to move up to the heavyweight division. A few weeks after the fight, Wladimir Klitschko, the IBF, IBO, and WBO heavyweight champion, said he wanted to fight Haye.\nHaye gave away his titles at cruiserweight and moved up to the heavyweight division. He beat Monte Barrett on 15 November 2008, winning in the fifth round. Before the fight, he said fighting Barrett was a big risk and that he might have retired if he lost. He was meant to fight Wladimir on 20 June 2009, but pulled out. On 31 October 2009, he beat Nikolai Valuev, who is 7 feet tall, to become the WBA champion. Haye was 98 pounds lighter than Valuev; before this fight, no-one had won a heavyweight title match weighing this much less than their opponent. Haye said he has wanted to be the heavyweight champion since he was a toddler. He then beat John Ruiz on 3 April 2010 and Audley Harrison on 13 November 2010. He now says he wants to fight Wladimir or his brother Vitali, who holds the WBC belt. The two brothers are regarded as the best heavyweights in the world. Haye says he plans to retire before his 31st birthday.\nHaye was born on 13 October 1980 in Bermondsey, London. He went to Snowsfield primary school and Bacon's College. Jade Goody, winner of the television show \"Big Brother\", was in his class. Haye is married and has a son called Cassius, named after Cassius Clay, the birth name of Muhammad Ali. His training camp is based in Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus. He started training there in 2007 and sometimes fights with the Northern Cyprus flag on his shorts. He supports the football team Millwall. In September 2010, a newspaper in Northern Cyprus said Haye had become a citizen of Northern Cyprus."}

It is added to certain foods, such as salad dressings, to make them thicker. It is also added to cosmetics to keep the ingredients from separating. To make xanthan gum, workers add a kind of bacterium, \"Xanthomonas campestris\", to glucose or sucrose. They let the mixture ferment for a while, and then add isopropyl alcohol to separate the polysaccharide from the mixture. They dry the polysaccharide, grind it into a powder, then add it to a liquid. The xanthan gum is then ready to use.\nHistory.\nAllene Rosalind Jeanes and her research team at the United States Department of Agriculture first discovered xanthan gum. The team was studying many biopolymers to see whether some of them were useful, and how they could be used. The Kelco Company was the first company to produce xanthan gum in the early 1960s. At that time, Kelco called xanthan gum by its brand name, Kelzan. Later, in 1968, xanthan gum was tested and declared safe to be used in food. The USA, Canada, Europe, and many other regions and countries now accept xanthan gum as a safe food additive.\nUses.\nXanthan gum is a very effective thickener. It is stable under a wide range of temperatures and pH. Only 0.5% of xanthan gum is added to most foods to thicken them. The thickening property of xanthan gum decreases when a food is mixed, shaken or chewed, but it thickens up again when the force is removed. This property is called pseudoplasticity. Sometimes this property can be very useful. For instance, the xanthan gum added to salad dressing makes the dressing thick enough to cling to a salad, but shaking the bottle of dressing makes it temporarily thin and easier to pour.\nSalad dressings and sauces contain xanthan gum. Even though xanthan gum is not an emulsifier, it helps to keep an emulsion stable so that the oil in it does not separate. Xanthan gum also helps to keep spices and other solid bits of food evenly distributed in a liquid. Xanthan gum, guar gum and locust bean gum help to give ice cream and other frozen foods a creamy texture. Gluten-free bakers use xanthan gum instead of gluten to make bread dough or batter \"sticky.\" Packaged egg whites or egg substitutes contain xanthan gum to replace the fat and emulsifiers found in egg yolks.\nToothpaste often contains xanthan gum to give the toothpaste a smooth texture. People who have trouble swallowing add xanthan gum to drinks and other liquids to make them thicker and easier to swallow.\nOil drillers use a lot of xanthan gum to make drilling mud thicker. This thick fluid helps carry solids cut by the drill bit up to the surface of the earth. When people need to pour concrete underwater, they add xanthan gum to the concrete to make it thicker and keep it from washing away.\nMany cosmetics contain xanthan gum, which helps hold together oil and water emulsions. Xanthan gum can also help keep skin moist. Fake blood, toy slime and gunge all get their thickness from xanthan gum.\nPossible health effects.\nWorkers who were exposed to xanthan gum dust developed allergy-like symptoms from breathing in the dust.\nCoeliac disease sufferers and other people who are sensitive to gluten and other allergens may need to be careful how much xanthan gum is in their food. Some types of xanthan gum are made with wheat, corn or soy and could cause allergic reactions. Xanthan gum is also a strong laxative and can cause diarrhoea in people who eat too much of it, or who are sensitive to it. There are many substitutes available for xanthan gum when used in baking such as guar gum or locust bean gum."}

Japan attacked because Singapore was an important naval base for controlling other areas. The occupation started after the army of Japan defeated garrison troops from Australia, British Malaya, Britain, and India. This was at the Battle of Singapore. The British decided to surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 at the Ford Motor Factory.\nThe city was renamed to Syonan-to (pronounced as Sho-nan-to), meaning Light of the South, during the rule. It was officially returned to the British after the peace treaty ending World War II was signed. \nThe Japanese did not treat the people very well during their occupation. There was a large amount of inflation because the Japanese printed paper money for Singapore to use, which did not have any identification numbers. Also called 'banana notes' as they had a picture of a banana tree on them, the paper notes could have been printed by people who had a modern-day printer and sufficient paper.\nTimeline.\nIn 1941, due to the weak defenses, the Japanese attacked Singapore. They landed on Singaporean soil on the 9th of February 1942 and took control of the colony on 15 February 1942, soon renaming it Syonan-to (pronounced as Sio-nan-to or Sho-nan-to), meaning Light of the South Island, during the rule. Many people suffered during this time till the Japanese surrendered and the British returned to Singapore in September 1945.\nThe Black Market.\nDuring the Japanese Occupation, the trade was disrupted, resulting in scarcity of food and other kinds of goods, causing the price to drastically increase in a process known as inflation. Even if one were to try to buy a jar of jam from a shop, the shopkeeper would say that he had none. However, if one was prepared to pay a very high price for it, the shopkeeper would know just where to get it: the black market."}

The number returned is dependent on the length of both vectors, and on the angle between them. The name is derived from the centered dot \"\u00b7\" that is often used to designate this operation; the alternative name scalar product emphasizes the scalar (rather than vector) nature of the result.\nIn three-dimensional space, the dot product contrasts with the cross product, which produces a vector as result.\nDefinition.\nThe dot product of two vectors a = [\"a\"1, \"a\"2, ..., \"a\"\"n\"] and b = [\"b\"1, \"b\"2, ..., \"b\"\"n\"] is defined as:\nwhere \u03a3 denotes summation notation (the sum of all the terms) and \"n\" is the dimension of the vector space.\nIn dimension 2, the dot product of vectors [a,b] and [c,d] is ac + bd.\nThe same way, in a dimension 3, the dot product of vectors [a,b,c] and [d,e,f] is ad + be + cf.\nFor example, the dot product of two three-dimensional vectors [1, 3, \u22125] and [4, \u22122, \u22121] is\nGeometric interpretation.\nIn Euclidean geometry, the dot product, length, and angle are related. For a vector a, the dot product a \u00b7 a is the square of the length of a, or\nwhere ||a|| denotes the length (magnitude) of a. More generally, if b is another vector, then\nwhere ||a|| and ||b|| denote the length of a and b and \"\u03b8\" is the angle between them.\nThis formula can be rearranged to determine the size of the angle between two nonzero vectors:\nOne can also first convert the vectors to unit vectors, by dividing by their magnitude:\nthen the angle \"\u03b8\" is given by\nAs the cosine of 90\u00b0 is zero, the dot product of two orthogonal (perpendicular in 2D and 3D) vectors is always zero. Moreover, two vectors can be considered orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero, and they both have a nonzero length. This property provides a simple method to test the condition of orthogonality.\nSometimes, these properties are also used for \"defining\" the dot product, especially in 2 and 3 dimensions; this definition is equivalent to the above one. For higher dimensions, the formula can be used to define the concept of angle.\nThe geometric properties rely on the basis being orthonormal (composed of pairwise perpendicular vectors with unit length).\nScalar projection.\nIf both a and b are unit vectors (vectors of length one), then their dot product simply gives the cosine of the angle between them.\nIf only b is a unit vector, then the dot product a \u00b7 b gives |a| cos(\u03b8). This corresponds to the magnitude of the projection of a in the direction of b, with a minus sign if the direction is opposite. This is called the scalar projection of a onto b, or scalar component of a in the direction of b (see figure). This property of the dot product has several useful applications (see \u00a7 Rotation below).\nIf neither a nor b is a unit vector, then the magnitude of the projection of a in the direction of b would be a \u00b7 (b / |b|), as the unit vector in the direction of b is b / |b|.\nRotation.\nA rotation of the orthonormal basis in terms of which vector a is represented is obtained with a multiplication of a by a rotation matrix R. This matrix multiplication is just a compact representation of a sequence of dot products.\nFor instance, let\nThen the rotation from \"B\"1 to \"B\"2 is performed as follows:\nNotice that the rotation matrix R is assembled by using the rotated basis vectors u1, v1, w1 as its rows, and these vectors are unit vectors. By definition, Ra1 consists of a sequence of dot products between each of the three rows of R and vector a1. Each of these dot products determines a scalar component of a in the direction of a rotated basis vector (see previous section).\nIf a1 is a row vector, rather than a column vector, then R must contain the rotated basis vectors in its columns, and must post-multiply a1:\nPhysics.\nIn physics, magnitude is a scalar in the physical sense, in that.it is a physical quantity independent of the coordinate system, expressed as the product of a numerical value and a physical unit, not just a number. The dot product is also a scalar in this sense, given by the formula, independent of the coordinate system. For example:\nProperties.\nThe following properties hold if a, b, and c are real vectors and \"r\" is a scalar.\nThe dot product is commutative:\nThe dot product is distributive over vector addition:\nThe dot product is bilinear:\nWhen multiplied by a scalar value, dot product satisfies:\n(these last two properties follow from the first two).\nTwo non-zero vectors a and b are perpendicular if and only if a \u2022 b = 0.\nUnlike multiplication of ordinary numbers, where if \"ab\" = \"ac\", then \"b\" always equals \"c\" unless \"a\" is zero, the dot product does not obey the cancellation law:\nProvided that the basis is orthonormal, the dot product is invariant under isometric changes of the basis: rotations, reflections, and combinations, keeping the origin fixed. The above mentioned geometric interpretation relies on this property. In other words, for an orthonormal space with any number of dimensions, the dot product is invariant under a coordinate transformation based on an orthogonal matrix. This corresponds to the following two conditions:\nIf a and b are functions, then the derivative of a \u2022 b is a' \u2022 b + a \u2022 b'.\nTriple product expansion.\nThis is a very useful identity (also known as Lagrange's formula) involving the dot- and cross-products. It is written as\nwhich is easier to remember as \"BAC minus CAB\", keeping in mind which vectors are dotted together. This formula is commonly used to simplify vector calculations in physics.\nProof of the geometric interpretation.\nConsider the element of Rn\nRepeated application of the Pythagorean theorem yields for its length |v|\nBut this is the same as\nso we conclude that taking the dot product of a vector v with itself yields the squared length of the vector.\nNow consider two vectors a and b extending from the origin, separated by an angle \u03b8. A third vector c may be defined as\ncreating a triangle with sides a, b, and c. According to the law of cosines, we have\nSubstituting dot products for the squared lengths according to Lemma 1, we get\nBut as c \u2261 a \u2212 b, we also have\nwhich, according to the distributive law, expands to\nMerging the two c \u2022 c equations, \"(1)\" and \"(2)\", we obtain\nSubtracting a \u2022 a + b \u2022 b from both sides and dividing by \u22122 leaves\nQ.E.D.\nGeneralization.\nThe inner product generalizes the dot product to abstract vector spaces and is usually denoted by formula_26. Due to the geometric interpretation of the dot product, the norm ||a|| of a vector a in such an inner product space is defined as\nsuch that it generalizes length, and the angle \u03b8 between two vectors a and b by\nIn particular, two vectors are considered orthogonal if their inner product is zero\nFor vectors with complex entries, using the given definition of the dot product would lead to quite different geometric properties. For instance, the dot product of a vector with itself can be an arbitrary complex number, and can be zero without the vector being the zero vector; this in turn would have severe consequences for notions like length and angle. Many geometric properties can be salvaged, at the cost of giving up the symmetric and bilinear properties of the scalar product, by alternatively defining\nwhere \"bi\" is the complex conjugate of \"bi\". Then the scalar product of any vector with itself is a non-negative real number, and it is nonzero except for the zero vector. However, this scalar product is not linear in b (but rather conjugate linear), and the scalar product is not symmetric either, since\nThis type of scalar product is nevertheless quite useful, and leads to the notions of Hermitian form and of general inner product spaces.\nThe Frobenius inner product generalizes the dot product to matrices. It is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two matrices having the same size.\nGeneralization to tensors.\nThe dot product between a tensor of order n and a tensor of order m is a tensor of order n+m-2. The dot product is worked out by multiplying and summing across a single index in both tensors. If formula_32 and formula_33 are two tensors with element representation formula_34 and formula_35 the elements of the dot product formula_36 are given by\nThis definition naturally reduces to the standard vector dot product when applied to vectors, and matrix multiplication when applied to matrices.\nOccasionally, a double dot product is used to represent multiplying and summing across two indices. The double dot product between two 2nd order tensors is a scalar."}

He got his second career win on July 23, in the Pennsylvania 500, also at Pocono Raceway. In the Nextel Cup Series, Hamlin won the Raybestos Rookie of the Year award and finished third in the final standings.\n2007-2008.\nIn 2007 Denny Hamlin finished 12th overall in the final standings in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. In the Nationwide Series, Hamlin won three races, Darlington, Michigan, and Dover in the #20 Rockwell Automation Chevy.\nIn 2008, Hamlin finished 8th in the Sprint Cup Series and won early in the season at Martinsville Speedway. He won three races in the Nationwide Series, driving both the #18 and #20 cars for Joe Gibbs Racing, as well as the #32 Dollar General/Haas Avocados car for Braun Racing.\n2009.\nIn 2009 Hamlin won his fifth career race at Pocono Raceway on August 3, 2009. The win was Hamlin's third at Pocono. It was an emotional win for Hamlin as his grandmother, Thelma Clark, died the Friday before the race.\nHamlin also won races at Martinsville Speedway, his home track Richmond International Raceway, and the last race of the year at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Hamlin ended the season 5th in the Sprint Cup Series points.\n2010.\nOn January 22, 2010, Denny Hamlin tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing basketball. \nOn March 27, 2010 Hamlin said he was going to have surgery on his left knee the next Monday. If he did not have the surgery, his knee would have been injured worse.\nThree weeks after his surgery on April 19, 2010, Hamlin won the race at Texas Motor Speedway. It was the 10th win of his career.\nLater in the season Hamlin finished 43rd in a race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. This was the first time that Denny Hamlin finished last in a race. This race moved Hamlin into 10th place in the Sprint Cup Series points, and made sure he would have a place in the championship race. Denny Hamlin won 8 races in the 2010 Sprint Cup Series but finished the season 2nd in Sprint Cup Series points behind Jimmie Johnson.\n2011.\nAfter a strong second place finish in 2010, 2011 was not a very good year for Denny Hamlin. Hamlin had mechanical problems many times in 2011, and this hurt his chances at finishing well in the points. Hamlin only won one race in 2011, and finished the season 9th in the points standing."}

It lives right across the southern part of Australia. They live from just south of Shark Bay in Western Australia to western Victoria. In South Australia they live along the coast. They also live in the Murray-Darling Basin in New South Wales and Queensland. The subspecies on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, is called the Kangaroo Island kangaroo.\nDescription.\nThe western grey kangaroo is one of the largest kangaroos. It weighs 28\u201354\u00a0kg and its length is 0.84-1.1m with a 80\u2013100\u00a0cm tail, and is about 1.3m tall. It has sexual dimorphism with the male up to twice the size of female. It has thick, coarse fur with colour ranging from pale grey to brown. It has a paler color on its throat, chest and belly. It feeds at night, mainly on grasses but also on leafy shrubs and low trees. It has a nickname \"Stinker\" because mature males have a curry-like odour.\nThe kangaroo lives in groups of up to 15. The males compete for females during the breeding season. During these \"boxing\" contests, they would lock arms and try to push each other over. Usually, only the strongest male in the group mates. The gestation period is 30\u201331 days. After the birth, the tiny baby Joey attaches to the teat in the females pouch for nine months. After it comes out of the pouch, it will continue to drink milk from the mother's pouch for about another nine months.\nClassification.\nLong known to the Aboriginal people of Australia, for Europeans, the western grey was the centre of a great deal of sometimes comical taxonomic confusion for almost 200 years. It was first noted by European settlers when the great explorer Matthew Flinders landed on Kangaroo Island in 1802. Flinders shot several for food but assumed that they were eastern grey kangaroos. In 1803 French explorers captured several Kangaroo Island Western Greys and shipped them home to Paris, where they lived in the zoological gardens for some years. Eventually, researchers at the Paris Museum of Natural History recognised that these animals were indeed different and formally described the species as \"Macropus fuliginosus\" in 1817. Unfortunately, for reasons that remain unclear, it was described as native to Tasmania.\nThere the matter rested for over 100 years, and it was not until 1917 that researchers realised that the \"forester kangaroo\" of Tasmania was in fact \"Macropus giganteus\", the same western grey kangaroo that was, and still is, widespread in the more fertile south-eastern part of the mainland. By 1971, it was understood that the Kangaroo Island species was the same as the kangaroos of southern Western Australia, and that this population extended through much of the eastern part of the continent as well. For a time, three subspecies were described, two on the mainland and one on Kangaroo Island. Finally, by the early 1990s, the current understanding emerged.\nSubspecies.\nThere are two subspecies of the western grey: \"Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus\" which lives on Kangaroo Island, and \"Macropus fuliginosus melanops\", which has a range of different types that change gradually from west to east.\nThe western grey does not live in the tropical north or the fertile south-east of Australia. The eastern grey does not live over the NSW-South Australia border, but the two species are both common in the Murray-Darling Basin area. They never interbreed in the wild, although hybrids between eastern grey females and western grey males have been produced in captivity.\nThe western grey kangaroo is also called the black-faced kangaroo, mallee kangaroo, sooty kangaroo and carno kangaroo."}

It often uses a stop-motion camera to \"liven\", or animate, the photos made by the producer. When movie-makers use stop-motion, they need to draw one picture for every scene. However, there are tools to help save time with movie-making. Other types of animation, such as limited or digital animation, can also be used now. FPS is the number of times a movie is shot in one second.\nProcess.\nFilming.\nThe photographer first shoots out or edits many photos. These photos are combined to make the storyline. And as with all movies, not all scenes make it into the final movie.\nEditing.\nMany people help out in the editing of a movie. But in old times, people had to draw the scenes on their own. Then the stop-motion camera took a photo of a scene once a second.\nInvolvement.\nMost movies or cartoons in the 1950's required very hard work of the editors. To make things cheaper, though, people made limited animation that used two to three copies of the same image (so the stop-motion process would be two to three times faster.)\nCurrent.\nRight now movie-makers use digital animation to \"liven the movie even more\". Movies from the 2000 to 2010 years are usually 1\u20132 hours long.\nCommon units.\nFPS.\nFPS, or \"frames per second\", is the number of scenes being shot in one second. The higher this is, the more \"smooth\" the film looks. Most movies have an FPS of 24 to 60.\nTools.\nCels.\nCels, or celluloids, are tools used to \"preserve\" scenes. An editor uses a cell to draw a scene then make changes to it on the next drawing. It is useful when a cartoon or movie involves moving figures or objects.\nSketcher.\nSometimes a sketch pad is used to draft the scenes the editors think would be good in the movie. A sketchpad at first may contain a comic book that looks like an animation when the editors flip it back and forth.\nLive video shower.\nOften editors preview the animation with a video shower. On the stream of scenes, movie-makers test their animation and fix bugs or problems."}

A collection of his teachings in the form of poetic songs called \"The Hundred Thousand songs of Milarepa\", and his biography \"The Life of Milarepa\" are two of the most popular books in Tibet.\nMilarepa was a student of Marpa and the teacher of Gampopa. Together these three (Marpa, Milarepa and Gampopa) are considered to be the founders of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.\nLife.\nMilarepa was born in the village of Kya Ngatsa in the Gungthang province of western Tibet to a family of farmers. He was named Mila Th\u00f6paga, which means \"Mila, a joy to hear.\" When his father died, Milarepa's uncle and aunt took all of the family's wealth and property and mistreated Milarepa, his mother and sister. At his mother's urging, Milarepa left home and studied magic so that he could take revenge on his uncle and aunt.\nWhile his aunt and uncle were having a party to celebrate the marriage of their son, Mila took his revenge by summoning a great hail storm to demolish their house, which killed 35 people. The villagers were angry and set off to look for Milarepa, but his mother got word to him and he sent anther hailstorm to destroy their crops.\nMila later came to regret his evil actions and so became determined to practice the Buddha's teachings. Setting out to find a teacher, he was eventually led to Marpa the translator. Marpa proved a harsh task master. Before Marpa would teach Mila, he had him build and then demolish three towers in turn and go through many other trials. Eventually Mila was granted the teachings of the Six Yogas of Naropa and Mahamudra. After practicing these teacings very diligently for twelve years in remote Himalayan caves of Tibet and Nepal, Mila attained the complete enlightenment. He is said to be the first to achieve this state within one lifetime. During his meditation practice he ate mostly nettle soup which made his skin turn green, and wore only a single cotton robe. He became known as Milarepa, which means the \"Mila, the cotton clad one\".\nLater Milarepa become a wandering teacher and attracted many disciples, of whom the most well known were Rechungpa and Gampopa. Rechungpa followed the yogic lifestyle of his teacher while Gampopa, a Kadampa monk, eventually established a monastery a Daglha Gampo which became the first Kagyu institution. Later Gampopa's immediate disciples and their successors established the various branches of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism."}

During his short life he became world-famous. Many people thought of him as the greatest horn player ever. He made the horn very popular among classical music lovers in Britain. His recordings include the four horn concertos by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart which he recorded with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Herbert von Karajan.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nDennis Brain was born in London on 17 May 1921. Several of his family were horn players, including his father Aubrey, his grandfather Alfred Edwin Brain Sr and his uncle Alfred Edwin Brain Jr. His mother Marion was a singer who had sung at Covent Garden. He had a brother Leonard who was 6 years older and who was to become an excellent oboe player.\nDennis started to learn the piano. He also played bugle in the school cadet band at Richmond Hill Preparatory School. From there he was sent to St Paul\u2019s School in Kensington where he sang in the choir and played piano solos at concerts. In 1936 he left school and got a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music where he learned the horn with his father as well as the piano and, from 1938, the organ. He learned a lot from his organ teacher G.D.Cunningham who had taught his uncle Alfred the piano some 40 years before.\nDennis\u2019s first professional concert was at the Queen\u2019s Hall in 1938 when he played Bach\u2019s Brandenburg Concerto no 1 together with his father (there are important solo parts for two horns in this music). Soon he was playing in other concerts and making gramophone recordings.\nThe war years.\nThe outbreak of World War II in 1939 interrupted his last year of studies. All theatre halls and concert-halls were closed. He managed to get a job as principal horn with the RAF Central Band which were in Uxbridge in north-west London. Dennis was always a very friendly person who got on well with everybody. The older players in the band might not have liked a 17-year-old boy to have a principal\u2019s job, but everybody realized he had exceptional skills. He played in concerts whenever possible. There were lunch-hour concerts in the National Gallery during the war, and he often played in these. He started to become famous. He met Benjamin Britten and he persuaded him to compose his \"Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings\". He performed it in 1943 with the tenor Peter Pears and they recorded it for Decca in 1944. He toured the USA with the RAF Orchestra. Several conductors heard him and wanted Brain to join their orchestra.\nAfter the war.\nBy 1945, Brain was the most famous horn player in England. He was still only 24. His father hurt himself in a fall and could not play much. Dennis took over some of his work. After the war two new orchestras were formed in London: the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Brain was made principal horn player in both. Later, he left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra because he did not have time.\nBrain played a lot of chamber music, forming a wind quintet with his brother in 1946. This group got bigger and toured to Germany, Italy and Austria. Brain also started a trio with the pianist Wilfrid Parry and violinist Jean Pougnet. The trio toured Scotland twice and there were plans to tour Australia in the winter of 1957.\nIn November 1953 Brain recorded the Mozart Horn Concertos Nos. 1\u20134 for EMI with the Philharmonia Orchestra with Karajan conducting. He kept up his organ playing (his teacher had hoped he would become an organist) and in July 1954, again conducted by Karajan, Brain performed the organ part in a recording of the Easter hymn from Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\".\nIn 1955 Brain became known to millions of people when he presented a radio program called \"The Early Horn\".\nBrain had a good sense of humour. Among the many concerts he played in was a music festival in 1956 which celebrated the life of Gerard Hoffnung, the artist who had drawn many cartoons about music. Dennis played a Leopold Mozart horn concerto by blowing through rubber hose pipes. He cut the hose to the length he needed with garden shears so that it was perfectly in tune.\nBrain was known for being careless. The horn he played for many years had lots of dents in it because he kept knocking it or dropping it. Benjamin Britten gave him a second copy of music for a new work he had written. Inside he wrote: \"For Dennis - in case he loses the other one\". His Alexander horn was badly damaged in his fatal crash. Normally it would have been thrown away, but it was saved and was restored by Paxmans of London and can be seen in the Royal Academy of Music's free museum.\nNew works.\nBrain often asked composers to write new works for him to perform. Many composers wrote for him without even being asked. Among them were Benjamin Britten \"Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings\", \"Canticle III\", Malcolm Arnold \"Horn Concerto No. 2\", Paul Hindemith \"Concerto for Horn and Orchestra\", York Bowen \"Concerto for Horn, Strings and Timpani\", Peter Racine Fricker \"Horn Sonata\" (Dennis was at school with Peter), Gordon Jacob \"Concerto for Horn and String Orchestra\", M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Seiber \"Notturno\" for Horn and Strings\", Humphrey Searle \"Aubade\" for Horn and Strings, Ernest Tomlinson \"Rhapsody and Rondo\" for Horn and Orchestra, \"Romance and Rondo\" for Horn and Orchestra, Lennox Berkeley \"Trio for Horn, Violin and Piano\" and Elisabeth Lutyens.\nBrain also made the two horn concertos by Richard Strauss very popular. He was the second to perform the \"Horn Concerto No. 2\" in public in 1948.\nHis hobby: motoring.\nApart from horns Dennis had one big passion: he loved cars. At orchestral rehearsals he often had a car magazine on the music stand instead of his music (he knew the music from memory anyway). His first car was an open Morris 8 with two seats. He shared it during the war with his brother to motor from Uxbridge into London. Later he had several cars. Whenever a car did not work he bought another instead of repairing it. He loved to drive and would often drive all the way home after a concert even if it was 100s of miles. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf let him drive her huge Hudson saloon car over the Gotthard Pass in Switzerland when it was officially closed because of heavy snow. On another occasion Herbert von Karajan let him drive his Mercedes 300SL. Once he bought a very rare 1939 12-cylinder Lagonda, but he soon crashed it and it could not be repaired. Other cars included a Citroen and a green TR2 sports car.\nHis death.\nOn 31 August 1957 Dennis was at the Edinburgh Festival playing a concert in the Usher Hall. The Philharmonia Orchestra were playing Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 6, \"Path\u00e9tique\" with the conductor Eugene Ormandy. Unusually that day he seemed tired and Ormandy told him he should get more rest. But Dennis had a recording session the next morning in London, so after the concert he got into his car (his TR2), put his horn on the back seat and set off on the 380-mile journey back home.\nIt was about 6.00am the next morning when he was near London. It was raining heavily and he was on the A1 at the Barnet by-pass. According to witnesses he was travelling very fast when he came to a bend, the car left the road, turned over and crashed into a tree. The car was a complete wreck. Dennis was dead. He was 36 years old. He was buried at Hampstead Cemetery in London.\nHis fame and playing.\nWhenever Dennis played his horn is sounded easy and effortless. It had an extraordinary lyrical beauty and was always incredibly musical. He was a very sensitive player who listened very carefully to the other players and blended in with them. At first he played a French instrument, a Raoux piston-valve horn, similar to that used by his father. This type of instrument has a lovely smooth tone, but was less powerful than the German-made instruments which had become popular since the 1920s. In 1951 he changed to single B instrument made by Alexander, which was not quite as wide as the usual German instruments, still keeping the lighter sound of French horns.\nDennis had made the horn very popular as an instrument, not just through his concerts and recordings but also through the radio. He played difficult music that other horn players could not play. His Mozart recordings inspired Flanders and Swann's \"Ill Wind\" and his classical playing. His sudden death added to the musical legend."}

There were a lot of French horn players in his family. His father, Alfred Edwin Brain senior, played in Henry Wood\u2019s orchestra at the very first prom in 1895. Later he played for the London Symphony Orchestra. His brother, also called Alfred Edwin Brain, was principal horn player in Henry Wood\u2019s Queen\u2019s Hall Orchetra, but then he emigrated to the USA where he eventually played for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. His son Dennis Brain was to become the most famous French horn player of all.\nLife.\nEarly career.\nAubrey Brain was born in London in 1893. He started to learn the horn from his father. In 1911 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He soon became one of Britain\u2019s best horn players. The other great players of the French horn were his father, his elder brother and Adolf Borsdorf. He became principal horn player of the Beecham Opera Company. There he met Marion Beeley, a mezzo-soprano. They married in the summer of 1914 just before the World War I. When war broke out he joined the Welsh Guards and played horn in the band. After the war it was difficult for him at first to find a really good job as horn player . The best horn jobs were already taken by his brother Alfred. Aubrey and Marion had two sons: Leonard (born 1915) and Dennis (born 1921). However, in 1922 Alfred emigrated to the United States. Aubrey soon became first horn of the Royal Philharmonic Society (his father played second horn), and first horn of the Queen\u2019s Hall Orchestra. He was also first horn in the New Symphony and soon he joined the orchestra of Covent Garden as principal horn. In 1923 he joined the London Symphony Orchestra.\nIn 1923 Borsdorf retired as professor of horn at the Royal Academy of Music, and Aubrey took his place. One of his first pupils was his younger brother Arthur. Although very talented Arthur decided not to take up horn playing professionally and joined the police. Later, Aubrey\u2019s son Dennis was one of his students.\nMid career.\nAubrey had a very successful career, not only as principal horn player in several orchestras, but also as a soloist. He played Mozart\u2019s Second Horn Concerto in 1923 at The Proms. His playing can be heard on several of the very early recordings when the LSO recorded for HMV. Several works were written for him, including the Concerto for French horn, Violin and orchestra by Dame Ethel Smythe. He played it very well, including the chords in the last movement (it is possible to play chords on the horn by humming one note and playing another note of the harmonic series). He played it at the Proms. The conductor Bruno Walter invited him to play it in Berlin. This made Aubrey the first British horn player to play a solo concerto abroad.\nWhen the BBC Symphony Orchestra was started in 1930 Aubrey was their principal horn player. He was still principal horn player with the other big London orchestras (this would be impossible nowadays), but gradually his gave up these positions as the BBC Symphony Orchestra got more and more work and needed their players to be full time.\nAubrey played a French-type horn (a \u201cRaoux horn\u201d) which had a narrow-bore (the tube was very narrow). The German-type horn had a wider bode and made a slightly different sound. Playing on a Raoux horn there was more risk of a note cracking (not speaking properly). The German-type horn was becoming very popular in England, but Aubrey insisted that all the horn players in the BBC Symphony Orchestra continued to play on Raoux horns. Aubrey was a very skilled musician in chamber music and made a recording with the violinist Adolf Busch and the pianist Rudolf Serkin of the Brahms Horn Trio. It sold many copies and continued to sell for many years until the 78rpm records were replaced by long-playing records.\nLater life and retirement.\nDuring the war Aubrey started to have health problems. He had a bad fall on Christmas Day 1940. Towards the end of the war he started to get blurred vision, his speech became slurred and he had strange feelings in his fingers and toes. He retired in 1945 after the first rehearsal for the Prom season. He still performed occasionally, usually together with his son Dennis. He died on 20 September 1955, three days after a bad fall which gave him a heart attack.\nReputation.\nAubrey Brain may be remembered less today because of the exceptional fame of his son Dennis. However, he was a very great horn player who helped to improve the standard of horn playing in Britain, both by his teaching and by the example of his performances. The recordings on which he can be heard were all made before the days of the LP. His older son Leonard became a well-known oboist."}

In vertebrates (and most other animals) the brain is at the front, in the head. It is protected by the skull and close to the main senses of vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. As an animal moves forward, its senses collect data about the surroundings, and that data goes directly to the brain.\nBrains are extremely complex. The brain controls the other organs of the body, either by activating muscles or by causing secretion of chemicals such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Muscular action allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment; hormones and the autonomic nervous system make slower changes in the body.\nIt is also a part of human and animal body. The brain of an adult human weights about 13001400\u00a0grams\nIn vertebrates, the spinal cord by itself can cause reflex responses as well as simple movement such as swimming or walking. However, sophisticated control of behaviour requires a centralized brain.\nThe structure of all vertebrate brains is basically the same. At the same time, during the course of evolution, the vertebrate brain has undergone changes, and become more effective. In so-called 'lower' animals, most or all of the brain structure is inherited, and therefore their behaviour is mostly instinctive. In mammals, and especially in man, the brain is developed further during life by learning. This has the benefit of helping them fit better into their environment. The capacity to learn is seen best in the cerebral cortex.\nVertebrate brain regions.\nSeveral brain areas have kept their identities across the whole range of vertebrates, from hagfishes to humans. Here is a list of some of the most important areas, with a brief description of their functions as currently understood. These functions may still be disputed to some degree. Starting from the back (or, in humans, the underneath part) the regions are:\nBrain size.\nThe relationship between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied in a wide range of vertebrate species. Brain size increases with body size but not proportionally.\nMammals.\nAveraging across all mammals, it follows a power law, with an exponent of about 0.75. This formula applies to the average brain of mammals but each family departs from it, reflecting their sophistication of behavior. For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times as large as the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains. When the mammalian brain increases in size, not all parts increase at the same rate. The larger the brain of a species, the greater the fraction taken up by the neocortex."}
