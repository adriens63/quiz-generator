They try to give young people life values. BSA includes Cub Scouts, which is for children ages 6\u201311, Scouts BSA, which is for youth ages 11\u201317, and Venturing and Sea Scouts, for youth ages 14\u201320. Scouts BSA was called Boy Scouts until it started allowing girls in 2019.\nOrganization.\nScouts BSA are ages 11\u201317 and belong to troops, groups of Scouts associated with a church, school or post. Cub Scouts are scouts ages 6\u201311 and belong to packs. Cub Scouts include Tigers (age 6-7), Wolfs (age 7-8), Bears (age 8-9), and Webelos (age 9-11). Older Scouts can be Venturer Scouts.\nHistory.\nThe Boy Scouts of America were founded by American writer W. D. Boyce, in 1910, but were similar to Scouting groups in Great Britain and other early scout movements. James E. West helped out the BSA in its early years, but also made the BSA more religious than scouts were in Europe. Scouting grew in the 1910s and 20s due to the rise of \u201cboy\u2019s books\u201d devoted to Scouting and the First World War. Scouting had many members during the 1960s, but has declined since the 1970s, despite an attempt to make scouting modern by changing requirements and adding more merit badges.\nControversies.\nOver the years, the BSA has taken some stands that many Americans did not like. These included being against unions (organized workers) in the 1920s, requiring Scouts to believe in God, and not allowing gays to join Scouting.\nRank.\nAn important part of scouting is earning ranks. There are seven ranks in Scouts BSA: Scout, Tenderfoot, 2nd Class, 1st Class, Star, Life and Eagle. The first four focus on learning basic scout skills, including camping, cooking, swimming, first aid (basic medical care), citizenship, orienteering (use of a map and compass), and pioneering (tying knots). The final three focus on earning merit badges, serving the troop and serving the community. Eagle Scouts must plan and finish a project that benefits something other than Scouting, and earn 21 merit badges. They must also hold a position of leadership in the troop. Only about 2 or 3% of Scouts earn Eagle, but some of the ones that have include Gerald Ford and Neil Armstrong.\nOath and law.\nScouts must learn, know and follow the Scout Oath and Scout Law:\nScout Oath.\nThese are the words of the Scout Oath:\nScout Law.\nA scout is:"}

Unlike the pitcher in a game of baseball, a bowler delivers with a straight arm (see photo). A ball bowled with the elbow bent is a throw, and that is illegal. If the bowler bowls while not in the right part of the nonstriker's ground, or bowls the ball out of the reach of the striking batter, that is also illegal. Illegal bowling gives the batting team 1 point, mostly can't get players out, and doesn't count toward the limit on the number of deliveries in the game. \nA bowler who can also bat well, is called an all rounder. There are different types of bowler, and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types.\nFast bowler.\nA fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman. They can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 km/h. They take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed. Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 km/h. Another famous fast bowler is Australian Brett Lee.\nMedium pace bowler.\nA medium pace bowler bowls more slowly. They often use other tricks to defeat the batsman. They can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length (where the ball hits the ground) to fool the batsman. Some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs. Others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam; this makes the path of the ball unpredictable.\nSpin bowler.\nA spin bowler usually bowls quite slowly and puts a lot of spin on the ball which makes it bounce at an angle off the ground. This makes the batsman play each ball carefully. Generally spin bowlers give up the most runs but they all have \"tricks\" that they use to fool the batsman and get him or her out. These tricks are given names such as the arm ball, googly, flipper, topspinner or doosra. Spin bowling is very much about fooling the batsman rather than speed. A fast off spin is the normal off spin action but with more pace. Off spin is when the cricket ball spins towards a right-handed batsmen's bat (bowler's left to right). With more pace, there usually is less turn (amount of spin). Off-spin is also called an off-break or finger spin. A famous spin bowler was the Australian Shane Warne, but his type was the leg break, which uses the wrist to spin the ball from the bowler's right to left. This is varied with the top spin, when the ball comes on straight and low."}

The sticks can be put back in place and then hit back off to put the wicket down more than once.\nSides of the field.\nThe field can be defined as having two halves: the \"off side\" and the \"leg side\"/\"on side\", with these being separated by an imaginary line connecting the middle stump of both wickets. The off side of the field is the right side of a field for a right-handed batsman who is looking at the bowler, and the leg side is the left side.

Some animals cooperate with relatives, even if this brings risk to themselves. The classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals, or in colonial insects such as ants. \nMany mammals and birds raise alarms to warn others of danger. Others cooperate in tasks, such as scrub jays help each other with to build nests. In all these cases where animals cooperate, the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves. It is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related. This is because related organisms have (to a degree) a shared genetic inheritance.\nThe first to write about the concept were by R.A. Fisher in 1930, and J.B.S. Haldane in 1955, but it was W.D. Hamilton who truly formalized the concept. The actual term \"kin selection\" was probably coined by John Maynard Smith, when he wrote: \nBy cooperating, relatives influence each other's fitness. Under natural selection, a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency. A gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare. \nHowever, behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the actor, may nonetheless increase in frequency. Relatives do, by definition, carry many of the same genes. This is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection. According to the theory, the enhanced fitness of relatives may more than compensate for the fitness loss of the helpers (individuals displaying the behaviour). \nThis is a special case of a more general model, called inclusive fitness.\nHamilton's equation.\nHamilton's equation describes whether or not a gene for helping behaviour will spread in a population.

It refers to the northwestern corner of the United States and the southwestern part of Canada. The U.S. states of Washington, Idaho, western Montana, Oregon and northern California are in the southern part of the Pacific Northwest. The Canadian province of British Columbia and the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alaska is in the northern part. The entire region is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west.\nHistorically, the Pacific Northwest had man Native Americans. Starting from about 15,000 years ago, Native Americans settled along the coastline and along the major rivers. From the 1500s to the 1700s, Europeans explored the region, beginning with the discovery of Oregon and Washington. In the early 1800s, the famous Lewis and Clark expedition arrived in Washington State. From the 19th century to present day, the region began to become settled. Today, the largest cities in the Northwest include Vancouver, Seattle and Portland.\nThe rugged mountains of the Northwest consist of the Coast Range, which is nearer the coast, and the Cascade Range. In northern Washington, the Cascade Range is called the North Cascades. In British Columbia, it is called the Canadian Cascades. The many rivers of the Northwest result from its wet climate - the mountains trap wet Pacific air, leaving little rain for inland states like Idaho. The rivers once supported large salmon runs, but large power dams have been built on many rivers.\nThe main language of the Pacific Northwest is English in the United States and Canada, among the Native Americans Chinook Jargon is common. Among the many Asian immigrants, Chinese is being used more in the Northwest.\nGeography.\nThe Pacific Northwest basically extends from southeastern Alaska to Northern California. Along this entire length, is a large mountain range, the Cascade Range, that forms the geographic spine of the Pacific Northwest. The highest mountain in the Northwest is Mount Rainier. Rainier is high. Other notable mountains include Mount Shasta, at , and Mount Baker, at . East of the Cascades, there is the Columbia Plateau, a high area of land that stretches east to the Rocky Mountains in Idaho and Montana. In the west, the Coast Range borders the coast more closely. The Olympic Mountains are on the Olympic Peninsula, an extension of Washington State. Puget Sound is a large system of bays and straits in northwestern Washington and southeastern British Columbia.\nThe main rivers of the Pacific Northwest are the Fraser River, the Columbia River, and the Snake River. The Fraser River is mainly in British Columbia; it flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. The Fraser drains most of the southern Canadian Cascades. The Columbia River begins in the Canadian Cascades and flows south, then turns west where it meets the Snake River. From there, it flows on to the ocean near Portland. The Snake River is mainly in inland Idaho. After a journey west from the Rocky Mountains, it meets the Columbia at Kennewick, Washington.\nOther rivers in the Northwest include the Finlay, the Skagit, the Umpqua, the Rogue, and the Klamath. The Finlay drains the northern Canadian Cascades and flows on to join the Mackenzie River, which flows through Canada to Hudson Bay. The Skagit also begins in the Canadian Cascades, and crosses into Washington; it turns west and flows into the sea north of Everett, Washington. The Umpqua River begins in the Southern Oregon Cascades, and flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Reedsport, Oregon. The Rogue parallels the Umpqua and dumps into the sea at Gold Beach, Oregon. The Klamath flows south from a valley in inland Oregon, then turns west through northern California, cutting through the Cascade Range to its mouth near Klamath, California."}
{"id": "191821", "revid": "1061539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191821", "title": "Adaptation", "text": "Adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat. This process takes place over many generations. It is one of the basic phenomena of biology.\nWhen people speak about adaptation, they often mean a 'feature' (a trait) which helps an animal or plant survive. An example is the adaptation of horses' teeth to grinding grass. Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses' teeth continue to grow during life. Horses also have adapted to run fast, which helps them to escape their predators, such as lions. These features are the \"product\" of the process of adaptation.\nThe illustration of bird beaks shows an obvious sign of their different ways of life. However, eating a different food also means having a different digestive system, gut, claws, wings and above all, different inherited behaviour. For the major adaptations, what changes is not a single trait, but a whole group of features.\nAdaptation occurs because the better adapted animals are the most likely to survive, and to reproduce successfully. This process is known as natural selection; it is the basic cause of evolutionary change. \nGeneral principles.\nAdaptation is, first of all, a \"process\", rather than a physical part of a body. \nAdaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past, and became instead a continuing dynamic process. \"Ernst Mayr\".p483\nAn internal parasite (such as a fluke) is a good example: it has a very simple bodily structure, but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex.\nHowever, as a practical term, adaptation is often used for the \"product\": those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function is in doubt. By using the term \"adaptation\" for the evolutionary \"process\", and \"adaptive trait\" for the bodily part or function (the product), the two senses of the word may be distinguished.\nAdaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology. The other is speciation (species-splitting or cladogenesis).p562 A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes.\nAn organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places \"constraints\" on the evolution of development, behaviour and structure of organisms.\nThe general idea is that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. But polyploidy in plants is a fairly common large genetic change. The origin of the eukaryota by the symbiosis of micro-organisms is a more exotic example.\nEcological niches.\nAll adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches. This implies an increase in biological fitness.\nThese adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism (shape, body covering, armament; and also the internal organization).\nBehavioural adaptations are composed of inherited behaviour chains and/or the ability to learn: behaviours may be inherited in detail (instincts), or a tendency for learning may be inherited (see neuropsychology). Examples: searching for food, sex, vocalizations.\nPhysiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, phototropism); but also more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation, then, affects all aspects of the life of an organism.\nSuits of adaptations.\nImportant adaptations do not come singly. They come in groups, which work together to make the animal or plant successful in its particular niche or life-style.\nWoodpeckers.\nWoodpecker adaptations are a good example of how a whole suite of features are needed for a successful way of life.\nAncestral woodpeckers, which switched to climbing on tree trunks, had ancestral foot and tail structure. This suggests that a change in behaviour, perhaps to get at a better food source, was one of the first things that happened in the chain of events. The way evolutionary novelties start is an important topic.\nFunctions of adaptations.\nTraits with no function.\nNot all features of an organism are adaptations. It may need field investigations or experiments to find out whether it has a function in the life of the species.\nAdaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species. If a species has recently changed its life style, a once valuable adaptation may become a dwindling vestige. Animals which live in dark caves often lose, over a long period, their colours and eyesight. \nThe reasons for this may vary. The loss of structure and function may be a positive adaptation which saves energy and materials. But it may be simply a by-product of genes selected for other functions (pleiotropy). Or the structure may be linked in development, and affected by selection for some other structure. \nIt is a general rule that any adaptations which are no longer useful either become vestigial organs (see vermiform appendix), or may be selected and adapted to other functions (see ear ossicles).\nAdaptations with multiple functions.\nMany adaptations serve more than one function. This is often the reason some traits become so noticeable that they almost define the species concerned. The legs of a horse are also a main defence: a horse's kick is very destructive. The antlers of male deer serve a sexual function as well as a defence against predators. Man's large brain serves not only for language, but also for thinking and problem-solving. Bird feathers are not just used to fly; they are the basis of its heat conservation, temperature regulation and signalling\nCompromise and conflict between adaptations.\nIt is a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical evolution... is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder. \"Peter Medawar\".\nAdaptations are never perfect. There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body. It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces, therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations.\nAll adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but they cannot scratch their backs; mammals' hair helps temperature regulation, but offers a niche for ectoparasites. Compromise and make-shift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise.\nSince the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection, it is impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to the same degree. Ernst Mayr.p589\nPeacocks.\nCamouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colours are displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the need for reproduction. The peacock's ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources.\nDarwin's explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection: \"it depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in relation to reproduction\". The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice', meaning the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value. In practice, the blue peafowl \"Pavo cristatus\" is a pretty successful species, with a big natural range in India, so the overall outcome of their mating system is quite viable.\nHuman birth.\nThe size of the human foetal brain at birth means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The newborn's brain cannot be larger than about 400ccs, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis. Yet the size needed for an adult brain is about 1400ccs.\nThe most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.\nChange of function over time.\nThe function of a trait can, and often does, change over time. Several terms have been used to describe this: \"preadaptation\", \"exaptation\", \"cooption\". 'Preadaptation' is the most common term used when a preexisting structure or trait inherited from an ancestor evolves a different function. It was the term used by Julian Huxley and Ernst Mayr. The term 'pre-' does not mean any foresight, it just means the adaptation was already available, serving some older function. 'Exaptation' was Stephen J. Gould's word.\nOne example of preadaptation is in dinosaurs, which evolved feathers with the function of thermo-insulation and display long before they were used for flight by early birds. Sweat glands in mammals were later transformed into mammary glands. Another example is the long journey of the mammalian ear ossicles, which started in the gill covers of ancient fish, then became part of the lower jaw of reptiles, and then became part of the inner ear of mammals. Another example is the wings of penguins. Once used for flying, they are now used for 'flying' under water.\nChange of function in organs and structures is extremely common in evolution. Many of the features of tetrapods (land vertebrates) evolved from features with different functions in the ancestral lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii).\nDefinitions.\nThe following definitions are mainly due to Theodosius Dobzhansky."}

Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto Plata in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain.\nThe city was called first \"Puerto de Plata\" but later it was changed to just \"Puerto Plata\", the name that is still used\nHistory.\nColumbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493. The city was founded and built by Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando in 1502. Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and, in 1508, the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city.\nBecause there were many pirates and other British and French ships along the northern coast of the island, a fort was built here by orders of Carlos I, king of Spain; its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577. Because at that moment the Spanish's king was Felipe II, the fort was named Fuerte San Felipe (in English, \"Saint Phillip Fort\").\nIn 1606, those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town: Monte Plata. Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were, then, destroyed. They were founded again in the 18th century with families that came from the Canary Islands.\nPopulation.\nThe municipality had, in , a total population of 128,240: 63,564 men and 64,676 women. The urban population was of the total population.\nGeography.\nSan Felipe de Puerto Plata has a total area of (without including its municipal districts), about of the total area of the province of Puerto Plata. The city is at an elevation of , and at to the north of Santo Domingo.\nThe \"Cordillera Septentrional\" (\"Northern mountain range\") runs along the southern half of the municipality. There are only two roads that go through this mountain range. It rains a lot in these mountains.\nThe mountain \"Loma Isabel de Torres\" (the \"Monte de Plata\" of Columbus) is at about to the southeast of the city of Puerto Plata. It stands alone even if it is part of the Cordillera Septentrional. On top of the mountain, there is rainforest because it gets a lot of rain there; it rains almost every day. That forest is now a national park. It is high and there are two ways for getting to the top: by road or by a cable car (a type of car that runs on cables above the car).\nThere are many rivers in the municipality but, because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast, they are all very short. The two most important rivers are Cam\u00fa del Norte and Y\u00e1sica. Two small rivers that are close to the city are San Marcos and Mu\u00f1oz.\nThere are some bays along the coast. Two of them are the \"Puerto Plata Bay\" and \"Maim\u00f3n Bay\".\nClimate.\nPuerto Plata has a tropical wet climate (K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification: Af) with no dry or cold season as it is constantly moist (rainfalls during the whole year).\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is .

(Later editions replaced Hoffman's voice with that of Alan Thicke, then musician Ringo Starr.)\nStoryline.\n\"The Point!\" tells a story about a boy named Oblio (Mike Lookinland), who is the only round-headed person in a land full of people and animals with pointed heads. Banished to the Pointless Forest for not to what is \"normal\", Oblio and his dog Arrow (Don Messick) (whose head was pointed, but he was still loyal to Oblio) meet many different people, and come to learn that everything and everyone indeed has a \"point\"; a purpose for being what they are. Oblio and Arrow return home, bringing back what they have learned to share with everyone.\nHarry Nilsson said later the inspiration for \"The Point!\" was an LSD experience. Resting on the ground, he noticed everything (trees, buildings) that reached into the sky from the ground came to a \"point\", leading Nilsson to believe that \"everything has a point, and if it doesn't, then there's a point to that\". Nilsson developed this idea into a story about tolerance, and acceptance of in others.\nMusic.\nNilsson devoted a whole album to music from \"The Point!\", alternating songs from the show with his own of the story. \"Me And My Arrow\" became the breakout hit from the album, with a single reaching the Top 20 in the American music charts. (The song was later used in a commercial, for the Plymouth Arrow automobile.)\nNilsson later adapted \"The Point!\" into a musical stage play, that featured more of his own songs. A London production of the play reunited former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who were also friends of Nilsson's."}

Alice is a young girl who, while falling asleep outside on a golden afternoon, sees a white rabbit and follows it into a rabbit hole. When she falls down the rabbit hole, she begins her fantastical adventures in Wonderland. \nHer adventures include distortions of time and proportion. Throughout the story she shrinks and grows repeatedly as she meets characters of all kinds and sizes, including the iconic Caterpillar who asks \u201cWho are you?\u201d and Cheshire Cat who asks her \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\nCharacters.\ndinah(Alice's cat)\nStory.\nThe story starts with Alice sitting with her sister beside a lake. Suddenly, a white rabbit runs by. Alice runs after him. She finds his rabbit hole. She falls through the hole. She meets many characters underground and has some amazing adventures. She grows larger or smaller by eating different things like cakes and mushrooms. At the end, she enters a lovely garden. The Knave of Hearts is charged with stealing some tarts. A trial is held. Alice thinks the trial is ridiculous. She says so. Everyone is offended. There is a great commotion. Alice suddenly wakes up. She is back where she started, sitting with her sister beside the lake.\nBackground.\nThe story was told on a summer outing to three little girls. One of them was named Alice Liddell. Alice asked Dodgson to write the story down. Dodgson accepted the task. It took two years.\nThe story was first called \"Alice's Adventures Under Ground\". When Dodgson prepared the \"Alice\" story for publication, he added more events, such as the Mad Hatters's Tea Party, new characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and changed the title to \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\nThe story was so popular that Dodgson, (under the pen name Lewis Carroll), wrote a sequel called \"Through the Looking-Glass\". The Alice stories, often known as \"Alice in Wonderland\", are popular in music, movies and plays.\nAdaptations.\nThe book has been adapted many times to movies and television.

The goal is to find how three things move when they attract each other with gravity. It would be for instance the problem of the movement of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. Physicists do not have a general solution that always works. \nNon-relativistic movement.\n\"Relativistic\" refers to the theory of Albert Einstein called Relativity. This theory must be used when things move at great speed. But as long as things move at small enough speed, you can use every day classical mechanics, and this is called \"non-relativistic movement\". You know if the speed is great or small enough by comparing to the speed of light \"c,\" which is the highest possible speed.\nIn non-relativistic physics, one must know the place and velocity of the three things. One must also know their masses. Then one uses Newton's laws of motion to learn how the things move.\nRelativistic movement.\nWhen a thing is moving, it has energy of movement. Scientists use a short-cut when they talk about this energy, they call it 'E.' \nIn a field called General relativity, experts say that movement with higher velocities causes the radiation of gravitational waves. In this case, the thing moving loses energy, and this makes calculation more difficult. Experts say that the system is \"not conservative\".\nExperts in another field called Quantum mechanics, say, in addition, at high speed the creation and annihilation of particles becomes possible, so, it is not possible to keep the number of particles constant.\nThere is no relativistic solution that always works for the movement of two or three things.\nIn astronomy.\nThe three-body problem also happens in astronomy. The problem consists in calculating the course of three bodies, that influence each other with gravitation. The first to state the problem was Isaac Newton, in \"Principia\". Usually, two of the bodies are large, and the third is small. In the case where the two bodies have the same gravitational force, and that the bodies all have the same mass can be solved exactly. If this is not the case, the problem is solved through iteration and approximation. Many different patterns of motion can occur."}

A right-handed batsman, he played 22 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 15 matches, winning nine, losing one and drawing five.\nThe 'bodyline' tour.\nJardine is best known for captaining the English team during the 1932\u201333 Ashes tour of Australia. There, his team used 'bodyline' tactics against Donald Bradman and other opposing Australian batsmen. A bodyline delivery was one where the cricket ball was pitched short so as to rise towards the body of the opposing batsman on the line of the leg stump. The plan was to get legside deflections that could be caught by one of several fielders on the leg side. This tactic was considered by many to be intimidatory and physically threatening. Jardine is widely regarded by commentators and writers as the person responsible for that strategy.\nThe spearhead of the England attack was the coal miner's son Harold Larwood, the fastest bowler of the day. Larwood's partner was Bill Voce, also a top-class fast bowler. Ranged against them was the great Don Bradman, then averaging over 100 in Test matches.\nA controversial figure among cricketers, Jardine was well known for his dislike of Australian players and crowds. In return, he was unpopular in Australia, for his manner and the bodyline strategy. Many of his players thought him an excellent captain, though not everyone thought him as good at managing people.\nCareer in WWII.\nJardine joined the British Army in August 1939. Once World War\u00a0II began, he was commissioned into the Royal Berkshire Regiment and went with the British Expeditionary Force to France. He served at Dunkirk, where he was fortunate to escape but suffered some injuries. After serving as staff captain at St. Albans, he was posted to India for the remainder of the war.

His full name was Johann Nicolaus Graf de la Fontaine und d\u2019Harnoncourt-Unverzag. He was brought up in Graz, Austria and studied music in Vienna.\nFrom 1952 to 1969 he was a cellist with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. He soon became interested in performing old music with period instruments. He started a group called Concentus Musicus Wien. They tried to make the music of composers from the Baroque period sound like it had done when it was written. Harnoncourt played the viola da gamba as well as the cello. In 1970 he conducted Monteverdi's opera \"Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria\" at La Scala, Milan.\nIn 1971, Harnoncourt started to work with the conductor Gustav Leonhardt. They recorded all of J.S. Bach's cantatas. This project took until 1990 to finish. He also recorded Bach's \"St. Matthew Passion\". He performed with many other orchestras, including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Often they were orchestras who used modern instruments, but he tried to make them play with an understanding of a historical style (bowing, phrasing etc). Like other musicians working with historical instruments, he gradually realized that music from later periods such as the Classical music period and even the Romantic period used to sound different from what we usually hear today. He recorded the symphonies and concertos of Beethoven. He received many awards for these recordings.\nHarnoncourt was married to Alice until his death. The couple had a daughter, Elisabeth von Magnus, and three sons: Philipp, Franz and Eberhard (who died in 1990). Harnoncourt retired in December 2015 because of an illness.

At the beginning of his career the harpsichord was not yet a popular instrument and music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods was usually played in the same way as music from later centuries. Gustav Leonhardt made his audiences aware of what music by Johann Sebastian Bach would have sounded like in Bach's day.\nLife.\nGustav Leonhardt was born into a Dutch, Protestant family who lived in the countryside. His Protestantism was an important part of his life. His father was a wealthy business man. His parents were both very keen amateur musicians. When Gustav was ten they bought a harpsichord. When World War II broke out life was hard in the country and Leonhardt often had to hide under the floorboards so that he was not sent away to slave labour. When he was not hiding he spent a lot of time practising the harpsichord. \nGustav Leonhardt studied organ and harpsichord at the Schola Cantorum in Basel. At that time this was the only place in Europe where it was possible to study how to play early music. He went to Vienna to study conducting because his parents thought that being a conductor was a good way to earn a lot of money. However, Gustav was never very keen on conducting and he spent all his time there in the library studying music scores and copying music out. Most of this music had never been published and had not been performed since the time it was composed. \nIn 1952 he became professor of harpischord at the Vienna Hochschule fur Musik. He met Nikolaus Harnoncourt who had similar interests to his. He soon became professor of harpsichord at the Amsterdam Conservatorium and remained there until 1988. He was also organist at the Waalse Kerk, Amsterdam. This church has a very famous historical organ. He became well known for his harpsichord concerts and recordings. He led the Leonhardt Baroque Ensemble with the English counter-tenor Alfred Deller with whom he made one of the first recordings of some Bach cantatas. The ensemble included his wife Marie, as well as Nikolaus Harnoncourt who played the cello. Together with Harnoncourt he conducted and recorded all Bach's cantatas.\nLeonhardt lived in a big 16th century house facing one of the canals in the centre of Amsterdam. He looked very serious on the concert platform, but he had a sense of humour and occasionally played a bit of ragtime at the end of a recital.\nLeonhardt died in Amsterdam on 16 January 2012."}

In 1933 it got the name it has today: Vienna Symphony (Wiener Symphoniker).\nDuring World War II the Nazis forced them to be part of the German Culture Orchestras and they were used for propaganda. They stopped playing in 1944.\nTheir first concert after the war was on 16 September 1945, when they performed Gustav Mahler's \"Symphony No. 3\". Their conductor Josef Krips quickly helped them to become a great orchestra. From 1946 they were often conducted by Herbert von Karajan who toured with them throughout Europe and North America.

Their seeds are used as a spice. The two species are named \"Elettaria\" and \"Amomum\". The seeds grow in a small seedpod. This seedpod is triangular in cross-section and has the shape of a spindle. There is a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds. Elettaria pods are light green in color, Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.\nElettaria is commonly known as \"cardamom\", \"green cardamom\" or \"true cardamom\". It grows from India to Malaysia. \nAmomum is usually called \"black cardamom\", or \"white cardamom\". It grows in Asia and Australia.\nUses.\nBoth forms of cardamom are used to add flavor to both food and drink, as cooking spices and as a medicine. \n\"Elettaria cardamomum\" (the usual type of cardamom) is used as a spice and in medicine; it is also smoked sometimes; it is used as a food plant by the larva of the moth \"Endoclita hosei\".\nFood and drink.\nCardamom has a strong taste and an intense smell. Black cardamom has coolness similar to that of mint. It is commonly used in Pakistani cooking. In Scandinavia it is often used for baking. \nGreen cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight but little is needed to give the flavor. Cardamom is best stored in pod form. Once the seeds are exposed or ground, they quickly lose their flavor. High-quality ground cardamom powder can often be a substitute for the pods. That way, ten pods is about the same quantity as one and a half teaspoons of ground cardamom. \nIn the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes. Traditionally, it is also added as a flavoring to coffee and tea there. In Arabic, cardamom is called \"al-Hayl\". In Persian, it is called \"hel\". In Hebrew, it is also called \"hel\" (\u05d4\u05dc). In Gujarati (a derivative of Sanskrit), it is \"\u0112-l\u012b-ch\u0113\".\nIn some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar and cooked together in a mihbaz, an oven using wood or gas, to produce mixtures that are as much as forty percent cardamom.\nIn South Asia, green cardamom is often used in traditional Pakistani sweets and in \"Masala chai (spiced tea)\". \nBlack cardamom is sometimes used in garam masala for curries. It is occasionally used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. It is often referred to as fat cardamom due its size ('Moti Elaichi'). Individual seeds are sometimes chewed, in much the same way as chewing-gum. It has also been known to be used to make gin. Cardamom was used to make the spiced wine, claret, in the Middle Ages.\nIn traditional medicine.\nIn South Asia, Green cardamom is often used to treat infections of the teeth and gums. It is also used against troubles of the throat, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis, inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders. It has been used to break up kidney and gall stones, and as an antidote against the poison of certain snake bites. \n\"Amomum\" is used as a spice and as an ingredient in traditional medicine in systems of the traditional Chinese medicine in China, in Ayurveda in India, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.\nAmong other species, varieties and cultivars, \"Amomum villosum\" cultivated in China, Laos and Vietnam is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach-aches, constipation, dysentery, and other digestion problems. \"Tsaoko\" cardamom \"Amomum tsao-ko\" is cultivated in Yunnan, China and northwest Vietnam, both for medicinal purposes and as a spice.\nThe demand for these herbs has increased since the 1980s. Growing cardamom has become an important source of income for many poor farmers. These people usually live in higher altitudes, sometimes in remote areas, in China, Laos and Vietnam. \nUntil recently, Nepal has been the world's largest producer of large cardamom. Guatemala has become the world's largest producer and exporter of cardamom, with an export total of US$137.2 million for 2007."}

The numbers most used for measuring economic growth is gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income (average money per person). Others include the amount of industry, how much infrastructure there is, literacy, life expectancy and the basic standard of living. There is no exact way of saying what country is developed or developing. People often discuss the question of whose countries are the most developed ones,\nDeveloped countries have , which means that the service sector becomes more important, and the is less important. Service sector jobs are those where a person does something for another, like selling or fixing a product. Industry sector jobs are actually making a product, usually in a factory. In a developed country, industry jobs may be moved (outsourced) to less developed countries that pay workers less money. Developing countries may be in the process of industrialization (building the factories and infrastructure) and underdeveloped countries usually depend on agriculture, often subsistence farming.\nThe first industrialised country was the UK, followed by Belgium. Later industrialised countries were Germany, the US, France and other Western European countries. According to , the current split between the developed and developing world is mostly an event of the 20th century.\nInfluence.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, developed countries supplied over half of the global GDP in 2010. In 2012, the \"major advanced economies\" were the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and Canada. These are also called the G7.\nThe G7 has 10% of the world's population, but produces nearly 40% of the world's GDP. They also control many of the economic decisions that affect the world. The United Nations Security Council has five permanent members, four of those are in the G8 (G7 plus Russia).\nSimilar terms.\nTerms similar to \"developed country\" include \"advanced country\", \"industrialised country\", \"more developed country (MDC), \"more economically developed country (MEDC) (compared to \"less economically developed country(LEDC)\"), \"Global North country\", \"first-world country\", and \" country\". \nOther ways to measure.\nEconomic criteria are usually seen as most important. This includes income per capita (average money for each person). Countries with high GDP per capita and mature industrialization are described as \"developed countries\". But modernization is not always seen as the only way to measure progress.\nRecently, another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines jobs, income, along with access to medicine, life expectancy, and education has become prominent. The UN HDI is measures a country's level of human development. While there is a strong connection between a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, it is not always the case. The top 47 countries by HDI have scores ranging from 0.793 in Barbados to 0.955 in Norway. Many countries having an HDI of 0.788 and over (as of 2010), are also listed by IMF or CIA as \"advanced\" (as of 2009). The country of Bhutan started the idea of Gross National Happiness (GNH), to measure how happy people actually are. They felt the GNH was as important as GDP, and this idea has spread beyond Bhutan."}

It is concerned with how information and computation are related. Most information can be represented as a String (or a sequence of characters). Algorithmic information theory studies the complexity of information represented that way (In other words, how difficult it is to get that information, or how long it takes). Unlike regular information theory, it uses Kolmogorov complexity to describe complexity, and not the measure of complexity developed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin .\nExample.\nAccording to Claude Shannon the following two binary strings have the same content in information (this is only valid for the first-order entropy):\nThe first was generated with a random number generator, for example by throwing a coin. The second is easier to describe (eight times \"1\", then eight times \"0\"). For this reason, the first sequence has more algorithmic information, because it is harder to shorten (\"compress\") the description on how to generate it. Shortening the description may not be possible at all. The information value of a string is higher, if it is more difficult to shorten (\"compress\") its description. Random strings and white noise do not contain patterns that occur again. For this reason they cannot be compressed, and have a higher information value. "}

It says that God is unique and one and He has no equal. It also says that since the God is the only creator, there is no room for lesser Gods or deities. Any lesser gods are therefore false. Tawhid is an essential part of Islam. To become a Muslim it is necessary to accept it. The concept of Tawhid has many implications. Since God is the only power, both good and bad flow from God. So, whatever good or bad occurs to an individual, both are from God and both should be accepted by the individual. Since God is the only power worth worshipping, reliance on any other source for help is not permissible.\nThe Qur'an explains the nature of God in Chapter 112:\nSay: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; None is born of Him, nor is He born; And there is no one like him.\nAssociating any other thing or person as being comparable to God is called \"shirk\" in Islam. This is the only sin in Islam which cannot be forgiven by God, unless a person turns repentant on Earth. The Koran can also be interpreted as telling Muslims to not follow the idea of the \"trinity,\" the Christian concept for explaining God. Since the trinity views God as being made up of three different parts, many Muslims view this as \"shirk\". On the other hand, Christians will say that they view the trinity as making up one God, so it is not \"shirk\". The Koran also says that Jesus did not claim to be anything more than a human being, while in Christianity he is part of the trinity. According to Muslim scripture, Jesus claims to be prophet chosen by God, different from the divine status he has in Christianity."}

{"id": "192250", "revid": "734766", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192250", "title": "Asperger syndrome", "text": "Asperger syndrome (often Asperger's syndrome) is a form of autism spectrum disorder. It affects the way in which a person understands, talks and acts with other people. A person who has Asperger syndrome may not fit in well with other people, and may be unable to act like everyone else in different social situations. Neurotypical (or NT) is a term that was coined in the autistic community as a label for those other people who are not on the autism spectrum. Asperger syndrome is thought to manifest as a developmental disorder, and is not considered a mental illness. Most adults with Asperger syndrome can learn how to make friends, do useful work, and live successful lives. \nPeople who have it will have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. However, they can try many solutions to help them and learn how to be able to reduce the impact in their life. One solution can be medication to restrict the different symptoms like aggression. The big problem with people affected by Asperger's is that they cannot understand emotions or how people think. Therapists attempt to help the person with that. They will do many activities like acting an emotion and let the Asperger people guess what it is.\nCauses and management.\nAsperger syndrome may be observed and diagnosed in early childhood. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it is thought to have a genetic cause. The part of the brain which controls a person's \"social behavior\" (understanding and communicating with other people) may grow or function differently in a person with Asperger syndrome. Another part of the brain that may be different is the part that controls some body movement such as balance. A person with this condition may walk or act in a clumsy way and have trouble doing body actions such as sports. They may also do physical actions repetitively, such as rocking, flapping their hands, or tapping their feet. The condition seems to run in families. Parents who have Asperger syndrome often have children who have it or another kind of autism.\nAsperger syndrome cannot be found by testing blood or looking at someone's body. A medical doctor needs to talk with the person and other people who know him or her well, to watch how the person moves and behaves, and to learn about the person's past. Sometimes a doctor believes by mistake that the person has schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD, or mental retardation instead. Tourette syndrome with \"tics\" (repetitive, uncontrolled actions like twitching, blinking, and coughing) sometimes comes with Asperger syndrome. Many people with Asperger syndrome also have ADHD and/or OCD. It has been estimated that beyond half of the people with the syndrome, also carries some other type of syndrome, disorder, disability, disease, or illness. The MSD Manual says \"strong evidence supports a genetic component\".\nPeople who have Asperger syndrome have normal to high intelligence. As children, they may need special help at home and school to learn social behavior. The syndrome cannot be made better by taking medicine. People who have this condition are sometimes given medicine to help them with depression, which is often experienced by people with the syndrome.\nPeople with Asperger syndrome can have a hard time fitting in with other people. This social awkwardness has been called \"active but odd\". Adults who have it usually learn enough \"coping skills\" to act in a way that seems normal, but often with a few differences. Most people with the syndrome can communicate clearly with friends and family. They may have more difficulty in communicating with new people. People who carry the syndrome can sometimes seem rude or uninterested during conversations, without meaning anything wrong. They may also get stressed or unsettled when things does not go their way.\nCharacteristics.\nAsperger's syndrome characteristics include:\nAsperger syndrome is noticeable when the person acts differently in social situations. Their social disabilities can have different levels. It\u2019s not everybody who have Asperger syndrome that have the same level. This characteristic is not the only one. Someone who dislikes people in general does not necessarily have Aspergers. Other characteristics that can be identified are that Asperger people hate any changes in their routine. They also dislike having eye contact. Most of the time they will try to avoid it. They will look away. Usually people who deal with Asperger syndrome have less facial expression than anybody else. There are many characteristics, and if someone only has some of them then they likely don't have Asperger's. Commonly, people with the syndrome tends to hum or pronounce different sounds to themselves, which they have heard in their surroundings, such as a reporters's voice, a man on the radio, lyrics from songs, words, things they have read, or what people around them usually says. They may repeatedly mention these words or phrases again and again.\nHistory.\nIn the 1940s, a doctor named Hans Asperger studied some children that were different from most other children that he knew, but were like each other. He called them \"little professors\" because he thought that they were interesting and wrote a book about them. Dr. Asperger thought his \"little professors\" had a different sort of personality.\nIn the 1980s Dr. Lorna Wing made up the name \"Asperger syndrome\" for people with high-functioning autism after research into Hans Asperger's work.\nIn 1994 Asperger syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).\nIn 2013 Asperger syndrome was removed from the DSM.\nAsperger's is one of many separate ICD Autistic Disorders that is still diagnosable using the ICD but can be found in the DSM as Autism Spectrum Disorder or Autistic Disorder; and is often referred to as Autistic Spectrum Disorder for clarity. Providers that use the DSM can; document and reference your ICD Autistic Disorder, provide you the additional DSM Autistic Disorder, and or provide a combination of the two labels (e.g Autistic Spectrum Disorder \"Asperger's\" 299.00 (F84.0), With Specific Learning Disorder, Mild).\nStatistics.\nAsperger syndrome is much more common in males than females. Statistics say that three males are affected for every one female.\nIt is widely discussed how common the syndrome is, as there are figures that show very different numbers. But, it probably lies between 1 in every 250, all the way up to 1 in every 10,000. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1."}

It allowed most of the car's size to be used for passengers and luggage. It had only two doors, but could seat up to four passengers.\nThe design was very influential for car-making in the second half of the 20th century. In 1999, the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T. The original model is considered an icon of the 1960s in Britain.\nThe original Mini was designed for BMC by Alec Issigonis.\nIt was first released in August 1959.

Different stars are visible at different times of the year.\nBy contrast, solar time is reckoned by the movement of the Earth from the perspective of the Sun.

It was set in a home for old people. The Dutch title literally means, \"Yes, Sister; No, Sister\"; because in the Netherlands, as in Britain and many other countries, female nurses of a certain rank are called \"Sister\".\nThe series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes. \nThe script was written by Annie M.G. Schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes. The songs were written by Harry Bannink.\nDutch people today, especially those who remember the original series, are very disappointed that, apart from one programme, the whole series has been lost. This is because it was recorded on Ampex tape which was very expensive so, after the episodes had been shown on television, other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it. Some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved. 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved. They were made into a gramophone record (LP) and later into a CD.\nA film with the same title, based on the series, was produced in 2002. It starred Loes Luca as Zuster (Sister) Klivia and Paul Kooij as her landlord and nextdoor neighbour, Buurman Boordevol.\nThe story.\nThe stories in the television series are about a group of people who live in \u201cRusthuis Klivia\u201d. The word \u201crusthuis\u201d means \u201cresthouse\u201d. It is usually used in Dutch to describe an old people\u2019s home (retirement home), although some of the actors in the programme were not really old. There was always chaos in the home. The characters were very strange. One of them grew spinach in the garden, one of them was an engineer who was always doing experiments in the cellar. One of them was a burglar. The neighbour tries to get everyone evicted (thrown out), but he never succeeds. \nEach episode had a guest actor who was often a well-known Dutch television personality.\nThere were many songs in the series. The most popular ones include \"De kat van ome Willem\" (\"Uncle Williams\u2019 Cat\"), \"Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster\" (\"Yes Nurse, No Nurse\"), \"Niet met de deuren slaan\" (\"Don\u2019t bang the doors\") and \"M'n opa\" (\"My grandpa\").\nNew versions.\nIn 1999 a book was published with reconstructions of the stories. An exhibition was opened between November 2002 and March 2003 in Hoorn, North Holland. A musical is now being made which should be ready by 2009. It will be performed in many theatres throughout the Netherlands."}

It was Wagner's own idea to start a festival for his operas in Bayreuth in a theatre which he designed himself because he was not satisfied with the way that theatres were usually designed.\nThe theatre that he designed is called the Festspielhaus (Festival House). Wagner watched the theatre being built, making sure that it was done the way he wanted it. He had some new ideas about theatre design. For example: he wanted the orchestra pit to be so low that the orchestra would not be seen by the audience.\nWhen the theatre was opened in 1876 his cycle of operas called the \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" was performed complete for the first time.\nThe festival immediately became internationally famous. Almost every serious musician in Europe wanted to go to Bayreuth to hear Wagner's music performed there. Composers usually either loved it and were strongly influenced by it, or they hated it and reacted against it.\nThe festival still continues now. Every August there is a festival of Wagner's operas. It is extremely difficult to get tickets because so many people want to go. People often wait for ten years before they can get a ticket.\nThe origins of the festival.\nWagner wanted the festival to be in a small town where people could just concentrate on his music. Bayreuth already had a theatre, the Markgr\u00e4fliches Opernhaus, but it was not suitable for modern opera. The town did not have a cultural life that would be in competition with Wagner's music. Another reason for choosing Bayreuth was that it was outside the area where the rights to perform his operas were not under his control (he had sold these rights many years earlier in order to raise money).\nKing Ludwig II of Bavaria gave a lot of money to Wagner to built the new opera house. Wagner also made tours across Germany to get money for it. Societies were established to raise money.\nThe architect who designed the opera house was Gottfried Semper.\nEarly history.\nThe opening took place on August 13, 1876, with a performance of Das Rheingold. A lot of important people were there, including Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig (who came in secret, perhaps because he did not want to meet the Kaiser), and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and the composers Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Franz Liszt. Hans Richter was the conductor.\nDuring Wagner's life the festival just performed the Ring Cycle and, later, his opera \"Parsifal\". After Wagner's death, his widow Cosima continued to run the festival. She gradually introduced the other operas Wagner had written, so that all ten operas were in the repertoire. The operas were always performed exactly as Wagner had done. Nothing was allowed to be changed in any way.\nAfter Cosima retired from running the festival in 1906, Wagner's son Siegfried took over management of the festival. He did some things differently, introducing new staging and performance styles. When he died in 1930 the festival was run by his widow Winifred.\nBayreuth under Nazi Germany.\nIn the 1920s, some years before the rise of the Nazi party, Winifred Wagner became a close friend of Adolf Hitler. Because of this, Bayreuth was able to continue getting a lot of money during the Nazi period. Wagner's works were used by the Nazi as propaganda tools. It is strange that Hitler went to performances in Bayreuth that included Jewish and foreign singers, long after they had been banned from performing in all other places in Germany. Winifred's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter to the anti-fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini, begging him to lead the festival. Toscanini refused.\nIt was during this time that the festival made its first break from tradition. They stopped using the 19th century scenery on the stage. Many people disagreed with this, including Toscanini and Richard Strauss, and even some members of the Wagner family. They thought it should stay exactly like Wagner had known it.\nDuring the war, the Nazi party ran the festival. Operas were performed for soldiers who had been hurt in the fighting. These soldiers were forced to go to lectures on Wagner before the performances, even if they were not interested in music.\nThe new festival.\nA lot of Bayreuth was destroyed by bombing in the last days of World War II, though the theatre itself was undamaged. After the war, Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court because she had supported the Nazi party. Ironically, it was because of Winifred that the theatre was not bombed. She had not allowed it to be used for military purposes, so it was not a military target. After the war the theatre was used for other kinds of concerts for the next few years. The festival started again in 1951, opening with a performance of Beethoven's Symphony no 9, followed by a performance of Wagner's opera, \"Parsifal\"\nWieland Wagner, the composer's grandson, had some very new ideas, including very abstract scenery. Some of the audience even booed. What Wieland was trying to do was to make a big break from the past with its association with Hitler. Wieland died in 1966. For a time people wondered whether the festival would continue. There were a lot of arguments within the Wagner family. Wieland's brother Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of running the festival for the next 42 years, while the money was controlled by the Richard Wagner Foundation.\nWieland Wagner started a workshop in Bayreuth in which directors could meet and discuss new ideas for presenting the operas. This made it easier for new ideas to be accepted, and gave new life to the festival.\nThe centenary of the festival was celebrated in 1976 with a great production of the Ring directed by the French director Patrice Chereau. His production concentrated on showing how the Ring was about the 19th century working class being used by the wealthy capitalists. Some people thought it was the best opera performance they had ever seen, others hated it.\n21st century.\nThere has been a lot of uncertainty about what would happen after Wolfgang retired. Many people wanted the festival to continue to be in the hands of the Wagner family. On 1 September 2008, Wolfgang Wagner's daughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner, were named by Bavaria's culture minister to take over the Festival. They have said that they want to \"bring opera to the people\". In 2009 Wagner's opera \"Tristan und Isolde\" will be live on the web. It will only cost \u00a312.90 to watch online. People will also be able to watch it for free on a big screen in the centre of Bayreuth."}

His mother encouraged his interest in insect sounds. His father lost a lot of money bring cloth into Slovenia and could not pay for Ivan to go to school. Ivan was given a scholarship so that he could go to school at the local seminary. He was able to save enough money go to study in Vienna. He studied natural history at the University of Vienna with teachers Grobben, Exner and Claus. He got his doctorate in 1897 and began to work as a school teacher in Vienna, and later in Hranice, Moravia. Exner helped him get a job back in Vienna. He worked in a secondary school there until his retirement in 1918.\nResearch.\nRegen began to study insects in great detail. He was one of the first Slovenian scientists to work in another country after World War I. He was the first scientist to study the grasshopper in a lot of detail. He studied katydid and cricket sounds, he proved that insects did react to sounds from each other. He was able to make crickets react to artificial sounds using a loudspeaker. In one experiment, he used a telephone to send sounds from one cricket to another in different rooms. Later, he showed that insects hear with their ear drum. He was the first person to work out what the ear drum does. He is the person who started the study of bioacoustics. He also studied the insects breathing, their hibernation, coloring, and how they shed their skin.\nRegen's largest project was his \"geobiological laboratory\", a large glass cage, called a terrarium. He used this to study the way crickets could find other crickets using sounds; this is called phonotaxis. Using up to 1600 females with normal or damaged hearing, he was able to work out how they did this.\nHe worked for himself after 1911, but he supported several groups and organizations in Slovenia. He started using Slovene terminology in his areas of study. In 1921, he was asked to be a professor at the University of Ljubljana, but did not take it. In 1940, he became a member of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and was also a member of Slovenian Society of Natural History.\nEven though he was a famous scientist known around the world, he was poor and lived alone. His experiments were paid for by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, but he was not allowed to be a member. He did all his work at home. After his death, a lot of his special equipment such as microphones, oscilloscopes, galvanometer, and his written notes were destroyed. "}

An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans, and in most other mammals. Although females have two X chromosomes, each cell can only have one X chromosome active. During early development, a process called X-inactivation occurs. In each cell one of the X chromosomes randomly deactivates. This causes different parts of the body to have different X-linked genes, and is responsible for the black and orange coloration of calico cats."}

The vest makes people float in water. It also keeps their head out of the water so that they can breathe. There are different categories of life vests. They are mainly different in how much flotation they provide. Some life vests inflate all by themselves, others need to be filled with air manually.\nA life vest has one very important property: The part of keeping the head outside the water works even if the persion is unconscious, or unable to do anything. A swimming aid will simply help the person in the water, and make swimming easier. It will not work on its own.\nPeople doing watersports, for example sailing, usually wear life vests.\nTypes.\nThere are two broad categories of life vests: \nLife vests are also classified by the minimum and maximum supported weight, which is usually printed on the vest. For this reason, there are special life vests for children. Also note, that the simplest types of life vest usually do not support the person wearing it becoming unconscious (and still guarantee that the person is in the right position, and the head is outside the water). \nTo be safe even for unconscious people, these vests must bring the wearers to lie on their back. For adults, this means that they must have a flotation of at least 230 Newton. Note that even with such vests, this can usually not be guaranteed: The wrong angle of hiting the water surface, or the position of arms and legs can prevent it. "}

This is usually done either by looking at how rich people are, on average, in different countries. Most of the time there are two groups, namely developing countries and developed ones. Sometimes there are three groups, in which case the third group is between developing and developed countries, and is usually called emerging countries.\nThese definitions are problematic, because a high standard of living does not just mean that people make a lot of money. The main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries. Just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better-off; they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher. This means they need to spend more money just to buy those things they need every day.\nFor this reason, there are different definitions of developing countries. The level of economic development also changes a lot from one developing countries to another. There are developing countries that have a high standard of living.\nMany of these countries have a lot of natural resources but not the Industrialization that would use them, so the resources are sold to the countries which can use them.\nWords used to describe these countries.\nThere have been many other names used to describe these countries, including:\nLess Developed Countries or \"LDCs\" is often used now because it seems less insulting."}

Today, the island belongs to Kiribati. It is one of the Line Islands. In the 19th century the island used to be called Independence Island at times. The island is uninhabited today, it has been made into a nature reserve for breeding seabirds.\nGeography.\nMalden Island is located 242 nautical miles (nmi) south of the equator, 150 nmi south of Honolulu, Hawaii. The coast of South America is more than 4,000 nautical miles (5,000 statute miles or 8,000\u00a0km) to the east.\nThe nearest land is uninhabited Starbuck Island, 110 nmi to the southwest. The closest inhabited place is Tongareva (Penrhyn Island),243 nmi to the southwest. The nearest airport is on Kiritimati (Christmas Island), 365 nmi to the northwest. There are other uninhabited islands nearby. They include Jarvis Island, 373 nmi to the northwest, Vostok Island, 385 nmi to the south-southeast, and Caroline (Millennium) Island, 460 nmi to the southeast.\nThe island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, with on a side, aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast. The west and south corners are slightly truncated, shortening the north, east and southwest coasts to about , and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2\u00a0km (\u20131\u00a0mi) in length. \nThere is a large lagoon with many small islets in the east-central part of the island. The lagoon is completely sourrounded by land. It is connected to the sea by underground channels, and is quite salty. Most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon. The total area of the island is about 39.2 square kilometers. \nThe island is very low, no more than above sea level at its highest point. The highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline. The inside forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level (filled by the lagoon) in the east central part. Because of this topography, the ocean cannot be seen from much of Malden's interior.\nThere is no standing fresh water on Malden Island, though a fresh water lens may exist.\nA continuous heavy surf falls all along the coast, forming a narrow white to gray sandy beach. On the west coast, the white sandy beach is bigger. On the rest of the coast there is a strip of dark gray coral rubble, forming a ridge. This makes the beach itself smaller.\nHistory.\nGeorge Anson Byron, a British captain, discovered Malden Island on 30 July 1824. He named it after Charles Robert Malden who was the first to land on the island. At the time of its discovery, the island was uninhabited, but there were ruins. Archeologists discovered that the island was inhabited by between 100 and 200 Polynesians, a few centuries earlier. \nThe ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges. Most of them are on the north and south sides. Overall, twenty-one sites are known. Three of them are larger than the others. They can be found on the northwest side of the island. The sites are either temples, houses or graves. The temple ruins are referred to as marae. Similar marae have also been found on other islands, such as Raivavae, one of the Austral Islands.\nThe inhabitants had also made wells, but later settlers found them to be dry, or too salty.\nIn 1828, guano was discovered on the island. In 1856, the United States wanted to get the Island, but Australian firms had already started to mine the guano deposits. Guano mining stopped about 1927. In 1956 and 1957, Great Britain tested H-bombs on the island. The tests were called Operation Grapple."}

The title \"Minster\" is given to churches which in the Anglo-Saxon period were missionary teaching churches. \nYork Minster is in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England. It is the 'seat' of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Church of England. The Minster is run by a Chapter (committee) under the Dean of York, who manages the affairs of the Minster. The current archbishop (since 2005) is Dr. John Sentamu. \nArchitecture.\nThe architecture of the Minster is English Gothic architecture, from Early English in 1270 to Perpendicular in 1472. The Minster has a wide, Decorated Gothic nave (where the congregation sits) and Chapter house. The choir (spelled 'quire' by the church) is slightly later English Gothic architecture. The east end, and north and south transepts are in a similar style. The nave contains the West Window, constructed in 1338. \nStained glass.\nSome of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the twelfth century. Over the Lady Chapel in the east end is the Great East Window (finished in 1408), one of the largest areas of mediaeval stained glass in the world. The window is known to be the work of John Thornton of Coventry a master glazier and stained glass artist who was active in England during the first half of the 15th century. \nIn the north transept is the Five Sisters Window, each narrow window being over high. The south transept contains the famous Rose window. About 2 million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral's 128 stained glass windows. Much of the glass was removed before and pieced back together after the First and Second World Wars, and the windows are constantly being cleaned and restored to keep their beauty intact.\nTowers and bells.\nA total of seven clock bells, 14 change ringing bells and 22 carillon bells are lodged in the towers. The carillon bells are played on a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber. The largest bell is Great Peter, which strikes the hour. It weighs 10.8 tons.\nHistory.\nYork has had a Christian presence from the 300s. The first church on the site was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. A stone building was completed in 637, and was dedicated to Saint Peter. Its school and library were started in the 7th century.\nIn 741 the church was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt as a bigger building, with thirty altars. The church and the entire area then passed through the hands of Norse invaders. The Benedictine archbishop Ealdred travelled to Westminster to crown William in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the church.\nThe church was damaged in 1069, but the first Norman archbishop, arriving in 1070, organised repairs. The Danes destroyed the church in 1075, but it was again rebuilt from 1080. Built in the Norman style, it was 111\u00a0m (364.173\u00a0ft) long. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style.\nThe Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to compare with Canterbury; building began in 1220. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472.\nThe English Reformation led to the first Anglican archbishop. Some of the cathedral's treasures were taken by the Crown, and the church lost some of its land. Under Elizabeth I there was an effort to remove all traces of the Roman Catholic Church from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows, and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral."}

It is a surprise attack from a hidden position against an enemy. The enemy may be moving or they may have stopped. Ambush uses the element of surprise to confuse the enemy soldiers long enough to be successful. \nUnlike other surprise attacks, the point of an ambush is not to gain territory. Instead it may be used to harass an enemy. It may also be used to or key assets (people, equipment, supplies, etc.).\nIn history.\nOne of the earliest recorded use of the ambush was in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. A Germanic leader Arminius ambushed three Roman legions under the command of Varus. The 20,000 Roman soldiers were strung out in a long line of march through the densely wooded forest. They fought for days but in the end the Romans were completely destroyed. This was not just a military victory, it was a psychological victory over the Romans."}

The hollow ball is fired as a single round that breaks apart upon leaving the muzzle of a cannon. Grapeshot was much used until became obsolete during the 19th century. \nAn artillery shell is a hollow ball packed with explosive and a fuse. The fuse is lit by the explosive charge that sends the shell towards its target. It is designed to explode when it reaches its target. Grape shot does not wait. It begins to spread as soon as it leaves the gun or cannon. Grape shot is quite different from a shell or shrapnel rounds.\nShrapnel, while similar to both, is different and more deadly. Invented by a British officer during the Napoleonic Wars, it is a fused explosive shell filled with many small balls or iron/lead bits. When the shell bursts the small bits scatter in a more or less spherical pattern with usually fatal force. \nAll three of these rounds, grape shot, shell, and shrapnel, are extremely effective against troops, horses and other livestock. They can also destroy wooden structures from their fragments. Shells have historically been particularly effective as incendiaries against wooden targets, which they ignite from the heat of their explosive blast. Grape shot sends out mini-missiles across a wide pattern. This is best for people targets, but it may be quite damaging against nearby wooden structures."}

Using paratroopers is called \"paradrop operations\".\nHistory.\nThe idea of dropping soldiers from height dates back to Benjamin Franklin whose idea was to drop soldiers with parachutes from balloons. The idea was not very practical, but the development of aeroplanes in World War I meant that it was feasible (that is: a working idea) to drop soldiers with parachutes from air.\nItaly was the first country which founded airborne forces in the 1930s. Germany and Soviet Union soon followed. Germany was the first country to use paratroopers, called \"Fallschirmj\u00e4ger\" (German language for \"parachute ranger\") in combat in World War Two. Germany dropped paratroops in Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Norway in 1940. United Kingdom founded its own airborne forces in 1941. The first British paradrop operation was a guerrilla strike against an important water line in Italy. In 1941, the Germans launched a massive paradrop operation in Crete, capturing the island from the British. The British troops had fought back so bitterly and caused so heavy casualties (that is: dead and wounded) to the German paratroopers that Adolf Hitler forbade any further paradrop operations.\nWhen United States joined the war, it founded its own airborne forces. Americans made paradrops in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany itself. The first really large paradrop operation was the Normandy invasion, called \"Operation Overlord\" 6.6. 1944 where the British dropped one and Americans dropped two divisions of paratroopers in Normandy, France to capture important bridges and traffic junctions.\nThe largest paradrop operation ever was Operation Market Garden in September 1944, which led into liberation of Belgium and capture of important ports at Rhine mouth. The last paradrop operation in World War Two was Operation Varsity, which was used to secure the bridgeheads at River Rhine and to open roads to Germany itself.\nThe development of helicopter meant that troops could now be carried and landed quickly on the spot and there was no more need for large scale paradrop operations. The last large paradrop has been during the Suez Crisis 1951 when the British dropped a battalion of paratroops at Suez.\nTroops.\nParatroops are elite troops in all armies around the world. They work as light infantry, and receive an extremely hard and good training. They are taught to run, fight, carry weapons, move and survive in very difficult terrain and conditions. All paratroopers are always volunteers. To become a paratrooper, a soldier must be very fit, very intelligent, have a very good discipline and have enough courage to jump off an aeroplane.\nParatroopers are mainly used as rangers in modern warfare. A ranger is a soldier who is employed very far from home base, often behind enemy lines. Their main task is to capture important bridges, buildings, villages and other sites, do guerrilla strikes like blowing up an enemy railway line, capture enemy leaders and important soldiers and do long range reconnaissance (that is: scouting and gathering information of enemy troops, movements etc).\nMany paratrooper units have their own names, such as British \"Red Devils\", American \"Screaming Eagles\" and \"All American\" and German \"Green Devils\".\nOperations.\nParatroopers are dropped off at a place where they are meant to operate. This is called a \"drop zone\" (DZ). Paratroopers usually jump from heights of 100 to 400 m. They usually use round \"bell\" parachutes and they use static line deployment. (See the article Parachute on how the static line works.) They usually carry pistols and rifles with them, and their other weapons and gear are dropped on containers at the same time.\nOnce the paratroopers have landed, they take off their parachute rigs and gather to designated places. Their leaders then assign them orders. For example they may capture a bridge so their troops can use it, or destroy it with explosives so the enemy cannot use it. \nParatroopers usually fight as light infantry. They usually have few heavy weapons, and no tanks or heavy artillery. Once the paratroopers have carried out their mission, they usually wait for their ground troops to arrive and take control. They may continue to fight on the ground, or may return to base and prepare for the next drop."}

He has appeared in \"Super Smash Bros.\", \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\", and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a very fast and light playable character. In the game Pok\u00e9mon Go, Pikachu can be found wearing a Santa hat at Christmas.\nRyan Reynolds voiced Pikachu in the 2019 movie \"\".\nPichu.\nPichu is the pre-evolved form of Pikachu. It is a small yellow electric mouse, but is not as powerful as Pikachu. It evolves to Pikachu when it is very happy, such as loving its trainer. There are special forms of Pichu: a notched-ear Pichu, and a Pikachu-colored Pichu as event Pok\u00e9mon in the \"Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver\" games. Pichu has appeared as an unlockable character in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" where it has a cloned moveset to Pikachu's but takes damage when it uses electric attacks. Pichu features in the intro of the third Pok\u00e9mon movie.\nIn the anime episode \"Enter Pikachu\", Ash's Pikachu was born as a Pichu and was raised by Kangaskhan (a Pok\u00e9mon that looks like a kangaroo). After he became too big for Kangaskhan to raise, Pichu ran away and evolved into Pikachu.\nRaichu.\nRaichu is the evolved form of Pikachu and has orange fur, unlike Pikachu's yellow fur. In order for a Pikachu to evolve into a Raichu, it must use a Thunderstone. It can hold much more electricity in its cheeks. In the Pok\u00e9mon anime, Gym Leader Lt. Surge's Raichu has a battle with Ash's Pikachu. At first, Raichu wins, but Pikachu beats it in a rematch."}

Over the years, it became one of the biggest attractions in Florida, known for its water ski shows, nice gardens, and Southern Belle models.\nIt became known as the \"Water Ski Capital of the World\" because many of the sport's major \"firsts\" and over 50 world records were broken there. Many movies have been filmed at the park, including parts of \"This is Cinerama,\" the first feature filmed in that wide-screen format, and several of Esther Williams films and TV specials in the 1950s and 1960s. With their addition of a custom photography boat named Miss Cover Girl in the early 1960s, the park became a popular site for the filming of television commercials.\nCompetition for guests increased after the Walt Disney World Resort opened nearby in 1971. In the early 1980s, the Popes retired and gave the park to their son, Dick Pope Jr.\nIn the 1980s, book publisher Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich bought the park along with SeaWorld, Circus World (later rebuilt as Boardwalk &amp; Baseball) and Stars Hall of Fame, but sold most of the businesses to Anheuser-Busch in 1989. Busch continued to run Cypress Gardens until April 1, 1995, when a group of the park's managers led by Bill Reynolds bought the property.\nUnder President and CEO Reynolds, the park ran until April 13, 2003, when it closed after a long tourism decline following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 529 people were put out of work with only three days notice. \nRight away the Friends of Cypress Gardens, started and led by Burma Davis Posey, was founded. They enrolled members in all 50 states and 27 countries. Within three and a half months, this grass-roots effort raised $13,500,000 and saved the park.\nOn February 22, 2004, Adventure Parks Group, owned by Kent Buescher, bought the property and renamed it Cypress Gardens Adventure Park. The purchase of the amusement park portion of the Cypress Gardens property was part of a larger conservation agreement. In that agreement, the entire site was bought from its previous owner, First Gardens, L.C., by The Trust for Public Land, a nation wide conservation group . TPL then sold a conservation access over the entire property to the state of Florida, while Polk County purchased the gardens portion of the property, less the development rights conveyed in the state agreement. Adventure Parks Group purchased the balance of the property, also subject to the conservation agreement.\nBuescher's plan to reopen the park in September 2004 was delayed by damages created by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. Cypress Gardens Adventure Park finally opened in November 2004. One of its new rides, the Triple Hurricane roller coaster, was named for the fierce storm season. The Splash Island water park opened in 2005, along with the Galaxy Spin roller coaster.\nIn September 2006, Adventure Parks Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the Florida site following approximately $30 million in damages sustained by the 2004 hurricanes.\nLand South Adventures, a branch of Mulberry, Florida-based Land South Holdings, bought Cypress Gardens at a bankruptcy auction on October 16, 2007 for $16.9 million, leaving Buescher as temporary manager until Baker Leisure Group of Orlando, Florida took over running the park in January 2008.\nMany celebrities have skied and visited at the park, including Elvis Presley, Jordan's former King Hussein and his son, King Abdullah II. It was also the site of a Johnny Carson special.\nOn Monday, November 10, 2008, Land South Holdings announced the temporary closure of the park, which was shut down November 17 of that year. It reopened on March 28, 2009 with an expanded water park, named Splash Island. The rides and animals, however, were gone. The reopening prices were reduced. Cypress Gardens and Splash Island now have separate ticketing, though seasonal passes are available. Parking is now free.\nOther websites.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It was written for a very unusual combination of players. Four players are needed to perform this sonata: two pianists and two percussion players. The two pianists each have a piano, and the two percussion players play seven instruments between them: three timpani, xylophone, one side drum with snares and one without, a suspended cymbal, a pair of cymbals, a bass drum, a triangle and a tam-tam.\nIn the introduction to the score Bart\u00f3k gave very precise instructions about how the different percussion instruments should be played, the kinds of beaters to be used, and a plan of how they were to be grouped on stage.\nThere are three movements: a fast movement, a slow movement and a fast movement. The first movement starts with a slow introduction.\nThere are many interesting and unusual things to listen out for in the music. For example, in the first movement the timpani sometimes play glissandos. This means that the pitch of the notes slides up or down. The player needs to have timpani with pedals to do this. This movement is in sonata form.\nThe second movement sounds very creepy. Bart\u00f3k quite often wrote music which sounded like insects at night. This is one of his \u201cnight pieces\u201d. In the climax to this exciting music Piano One plays lots of glissandos.\nThe last movement is a big contrast to the atmosphere in the slow movement. It is like a lively dance.\nThe sonata was first performed in Basle in 1938 with the composer playing one piano and his wife Ditta playing the other one. Fritz Schiesser and Philipp R\u00fchlig played the percussion. It immediately became very popular and has since been one of his best- known works. Bart\u00f3k also made a version for the two pianos to play with an orchestra, but it is not normally performed like that."}

It is one of the most famous orchestral pieces of the mid-20th century.\nSeveral composers have written works to which they gave the title \u201cConcerto for Orchestra\u201d. It is an unusual title because a concerto is normally a work for one solo instrument and an orchestra. The soloist is given a lot of opportunity to show off his (or her) talent. In a \u201cConcerto for Orchestra\u201d there is no soloist, but the composer thinks it is different from a symphony because a lot of the instruments in the orchestra are treated like soloists during the piece. This is what happens in B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k\u2019s concerto.\nThe work was written in 1943 and it was first performed on 1 December 1944 in the Boston Symphony Hall by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with the conductor Serge Koussevitzky. It was immediately a great success. Koussevitszky asked Bart\u00f3k to write this piece. Bart\u00f3k had just arrived in United States from Hungary. He had to flee because of World War II. Bart\u00f3k had no money and so he was glad to get some work.\nThe music.\nBart\u00f3k often uses ideas from the Classical music period in this work. He also uses ideas from folk music from central Europe, especially Hungarian music. Quite often the music is not in a major or minor key. He uses folk scales which have different kinds of scales called modes. Sometimes tunes sound like folk music. At other times there are drones in the horns and strings.\nThe orchestra needs 3 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tamtam, 2 harps and strings\nThe five movements.\nThe first movement, called \"Introduzione\" by Bart\u00f3k, is a slow introduction which sounds like music describing the night. This is something Bart\u00f3k did several times in his works. It is in sonata form.\nThe second movement is called \"Giuoco delle coppie\" which means \"Game of pairs\". Pairs of instruments take it in turns to play a tune, each pair playing music which is separated by a different interval.\nThe third movement, called \"Elegia\" by Bart\u00f3k, is another slow movement, typical of Bart\u00f3k's night music.\nThe fourth movement, called \"Intermezzo interrotto\" by Bart\u00f3k, has a flowing melody with a time signature which keeps changing. There is also a theme which pokes fun at the march tune in Dmitri Shostakovich's \"\"Leningrad\" Symphony (No. 7)\". There is a very difficult bit for the timpani where the player has to play lots of different pitches in a very short section.\nThe fifth movement, called \"Finale\" is a very fast movement with lots of energy and plenty of folk tunes."}

Bluebird was a special kind of boat, called a hydroplane, that skims over the top of the water instead of pushing through it like a normal boat. Bluebird was powered by a jet engine. It set new world water speed records seven times; the fastest was 276 mph (445 km/h). Bluebird was destroyed when Campbell tried to set an eighth record by going faster than 300\u00a0mph (480\u00a0km/h) on Coniston Water in 1967.\nDesign.\nCampbell had been using his father's boat, Bluebird K4, to try and set new records. Bluebird K4 was destroyed when its structure broke. After this, Donald had the idea for a jet powered hydroplane to take the world water speed record from the American propeller hydroplane Slo-mo-shun. Ken and Lewis Norris designed and built K7 based on Donald's ideas.\nK7 was a three-point hydroplane, meaning that when going quickly the boat only touched the water in three places, one point near the back of the boat and one point at the back of the two sponsons (the sponsons are the floats either side of the boat, near its front in the photos). It was built of aluminium on top of a steel frame and was at first powered by a small turbojet.\nThe name K7 came from the rating given to the boat by Lloyds of London\nRecords.\nCampbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between 1955 and 1964:\nLoss.\nIn 1966, Campbell decided he wanted to make Bluebird go faster than 300\u00a0mph (480\u00a0km/h).\nBluebird's old engine was not strong enough to make it go this fast, so it was replaced with a more powerful Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine taken from an old fighter jet. Many other changes were made, the tail fin from the fighter was attached to Bluebird's rear, the cover over the cockpit was changed to push through the air more easily, and the floats at the front were also changed. Bluebird was taken to Coniston Water to be tested in 1966. The tests did not go well, the weather was too bad to test the boat while moving, so it was tied down and tested without moving instead. When testing the engine it sucked in too much air and caused parts of the boat to break. The engine was broken when the broken parts were sucked into it. This meant that the entire engine had to be replaced.\nAt the end of November the weather was good enough for some test runs, but the speed was a lot lower than Bluebird's old records. The fuel pumps could not pump enough fuel to the engine so it could not run at full speed. The problem was fixed by fitting two fuel pumps instead of one.\nOn 4 January 1967, the problems had all been fixed, the weather was good and Campbell decided he wanted to try and break the speed record. For a world record to be official, a boat trying to set a record has to make two runs at full speed that are timed by people who are not part of the record breaking team. The official speed is the average speed of the two runs. On the first run Bluebird's speed was 297.6\u00a0mph (478.9\u00a0km/h) which was fast enough to be a new record, but not quite as fast as Campbell wanted to go. To set a record of more than 300\u00a0mph the second run would have to be 302.5\u00a0mph or faster.\nThe plan for the world record attempt was for Bluebird to stop at the far end of the lake and refuel from another boat that had been put there for that purpose. Taking time to refuel would also give the lake, which had been disturbed by the first run, time to settle down again. On the actual record attempt, Campbell decided not to refuel and instead started on his second run immediately. Why he did this is unknown.\nAt the start of the second run, Bluebird was going faster than 320\u00a0mph (510\u00a0km/h) and would have easily broken the 300\u00a0mph target, but as the boat travelled along the lake it started tramping (which means rocking from side to side). Bluebird hit a wave made on the lake from its own first run and the boat spun out of the water. When it hit the water again it broke into pieces and sank. Donald Campbell was killed in the crash. His teddy bear mascot was found floating in the lake later on but Campbell's body could not be found.\nRecovery.\nIn 2001 a diver called Bill Smith led a salvage team which found Bluebird on the bottom of Coniston Water, and later lifted the wreck back to dry land. The wreck was taken apart carefully to keep it from rusting and is now being put back together again. There was a lot of damage caused in the crash but it can all be repaired. Bill Smith also got a new engine for Bluebird and hopes to return the boat to full working order.\nDonald Campbell's body was also found in 2001. He was buried on 12th September 2001 in Coniston cemetery.\nOn Thursday 7 December 2006, Gina Campbell, Donald's daughter, formally gifted the recovered wreckage of Bluebird K7 to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston on behalf of the Campbell Family Heritage Trust. \nIn agreement with the Campbell Family Heritage Trust and the museum, Bill Smith is to organise the restoration of the boat, which is now under way.[9] The intention is to rebuild K7 back to running order circa 4 January 1967. Gina Campbell commented: \"I've decided to secure the future of Bluebird for the people of Coniston, the Ruskin Museum and the people of the world\". "}

He is an archenemy of Batman. The character's creator has been disputed between Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger, and Bob Kane, even though many believe Robinson created the character. The Joker first appeared in Batman #1 (Spring 1940).\nBackground.\nThroughout his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a master criminal whose characterization has varied from that of a violent psychopath to a goofy trickster-thief. He is the archenemy of Batman, having been directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Batman's life, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon and the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin.\nJoker's creation was inspired by Conrad Veidt's role in the 1928 silent movie \"The Man Who Laughs\".\nThe Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains, such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes, including Superman and Wonder Woman.\nOrigin.\nThroughout the character's long history, there have been several different origin tales; they most commonly depict him as falling into a vat of chemical waste, which bleaches his skin and turns his hair green and his lips bright red, giving him the appearance of a clown.\nPortrayals.\nThe Joker has appeared in movies, TV series and video games; he was played by Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix in movies. On animated shows/movies he is portrayed by Mark Hamill, Richard Epcar, Kevin Michael Richardson, Larry Storch, Jeff Bennett, and John DiMaggio.\nBoth Ledger and Phoenix won an Academy Award for their portrayal of the character, making the Joker the second character to have its actor win an Academy Award more than once."}

The finding of this planet was announced in 1996 by astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. 70 Virginis was one of the first stars that was known to have planets orbiting it. When first announced, 70 Virginis b was thought to be inside its star's habitable zone, but proof was later found that the planet has an eccentric orbit, closer to its parent.\nCharacteristics.\n70 Virginis b is a Jupiter-type extrasolar planet that orbits around 70 Virginis every 116 days. It has 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is thought to be about two to three times that of Jupiter's. At the time that it was found in January 1996, it was thought that the star was only 29 light years away from the Earth. This could explain why the star was less bright based on its apparent magnitude (measure of brightness). As a result, the planet's orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was given the nickname \"Goldilocks\" (not too cold or too hot). The Hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was farther away from 70 Virginis and therefore its brightness was a result of the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone."}

It was developed in the Middle Ages. It started when people wanted to bring together what is called \"classical philosophy\" with the teachings of \nChristian theology. Classical philosophy is the philosophy developed in Ancient Greece. \nScholasticism is not a philosophy or a theology, but rather a way of teaching and learning. Scholasticism emphasises the use of dialectic. The main purpose of dialectic is to find an answer to a question, or to show that a contradiction can be resolved.\nScholasticism was started by people like Saint Ambrose and St. Augustine. They tried to use philosophy to help explain the doctrine and mysteries of the church. Ambrose and Augustine were among the first Church fathers who brought Christian ideas and Greek philosophy together.\nThe main figures of scholasticism were Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Bonaventure and, most importantly, Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica is an ambitious synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine.\nIn the 13th century, the teachings of Aristotle were considered more important than those of Plato. Scholastic education was very much based on written texts, and with arguments for and against ideas in those texts. In this way it differed greatly from modern science, which is based on observations from nature. In Aristotle the scholastics chose someone who was himself quite an original investigator of the natural world. But the scholastics themselves dealt almost entirely with the world in manuscripts written in two ancient languages. One was in Latin, the language of the Vulgate Bible and the other was Ancient Greek. Greek opened the doors to the writings of the Greek philosophers in their own language, at least so far as their works survived. The motto of Boethius \u201cAs far as you are able, join faith to reason\u201d reminds us that all scholastics were mediaeval Christians. Their main concern was to see how the Greek ideas could be fitted into their religious view of the world."}

{"id": "193420", "revid": "293183", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193420", "title": "Clay animation", "text": "Clay animation is one of many ways to make a stop motion animation. Each animated piece, either character or background, can be formed and reformed into different shapes. People making a clay animation usually use something soft, like Plasticine clay. \nMost animation is made the same way, whether it is cel animation or stop motion. Each frame, or still picture, is recorded on film or digital media and then played back quickly. When played back at a frame rate of more than 10\u201312 frames per second, the human mind sees the series of slightly changing, rapidly playing images as movement. To us it seems as if the object is moving by itself. This way of tricking the mind into seeing \"movement\" is the way that all moving images work, from zoetrope to movies to videogames. The way CGI animations are made is different from the frame by frame method.\nHow it is done.\nIn clay animation, each object is made in clay, usually around a wire skeleton called an armature. The object is put on the set (background) and a still picture (one frame of film) is taken. The object or character is then moved slightly by hand. Another picture is taken, and the object is moved slightly again. This is repeated over and over. To get the best results, special care is taken to make sure that each frame is the same as the one before. For example, the lighting has to be the same and the object has to be put back in exactly the right place. The only thing that should be different is the slight change the animator makes to the object.\nMaking a stop-motion animation using clay is hard work. Normal movies use 24 frames per second (frame/s). Animation usually uses \"doubles\" or \"twos\"; that is using two frames for each shot. This means that 12 changes are made for one second of movie. For a 30-minute movie, there would be about 21,600 stops to change the objects for the next frame. For a full-length (90-minute) movie, there would be about 64,800 stops. IF some of the parts were done with only a single, not double frame, there would be even more stops. Great care must be taken to make sure that the object is not moved by accident. For full-length movies, animators now use rubber silicone and resin-cast objects. One foam-rubber method has been called \"Foamation\" by Will Vinton.\nExamples of clay animation.\nSome famous clay animation movies have been made. Examples include:\nClaymation.\nThe word \"Claymation\" is a registered trademark in the United States. It was registered by Will Vinton in 1978 to describe his clay animation films. The word is often used incorrectly to describe any clay animation movie."}

{"id": "193427", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193427", "title": "Space Race", "text": "The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War enemies, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), to achieve better spaceflight capability than the other. It had its origins in the intercontinental ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War\u00a0II. Both governments saw having better spaceflight technology as necessary for national security. The Space Race enabled the first launches of artificial satellites, uncrewed space probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.\nThe competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites during the \"International Geophysical Year\" (July 1, 1957 to December 31, 1958), by declaring they would also launch a satellite \"in the near future\". The Soviet Union achieved the first successful artificial satellite launch on October 4, 1957 of Sputnik 1, and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. The USSR demonstrated an early lead in the race with these and other early firsts over the next few years, including flight durations measured in days instead of hours, the first multi-person crewed spaceflight, and the first spacewalk.\nBut the USSR lost its early lead after US president John F. Kennedy raised the stakes by setting a goal of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\". American spaceflight capability overtook that of the Soviets with flights up to two weeks long; two craft meeting in space (rendezvous) and joining (docking); astronauts working outside spacecraft; and using high-energy liquid hydrogen as rocket fuel in the Saturn family of rockets. Kennedy's Moon landing goal was acheived in July 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11, which sent and returned three men and landed two of them, a singular achievement far outweighing any combination of Soviet achievements. The USSR pursued two crewed lunar programs, but failed to develop a launch vehicle powerful enough to land one human on the Moon before the US, and eventually canceled them to concentrate on Earth orbital space stations, while the US landed five more Apollo crews on the Moon.\nA period of d\u00e9tente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard APAS-75. Apollo\u2013Soyuz began a period of transition from the Space Race to an age of US / Russian space cooperation by December 1991, when the dissolution of the Soviet Union brought the end of the Cold War and enabled the Shuttle-Mir and International Space Station programs between the US and the newly founded Russian Federation."}

The shape of his journey forms the shape of a cross. This had a religious meaning for Fanshawe. He made recordings on tape of the people he met singing their traditional music. A lot of this music had never been recorded before. When he returned home to Britain he composed the \"African Sanctus\". Some of the recordings he had made in Africa are played as part of the performance. The choir who sing live at the concert are singing some of the words of the traditional Christian Latin Mass.\nThe recordings are from Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda and Kenya.\nAt first it was called \"African Revelations\", but then the title was changed to \"African Sanctus\". It was first performed in London by the Saltarello Choir in July 1972, and was later played on BBC Radio on United Nations Day.

It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah. The city is on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is on one side and Mount Kinabalu, which gave the city its name, is nearby. Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 579,304, while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 700,000. It is the largest urban centre in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia.\nKota Kinabalu is often known as K.K. within Malaysia and internationally. It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo. Kinabalu National Park is about 90\u00a0kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city. Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia. These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia.\nHistory.\nIn the late 1800s, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo (now Sabah). In 1882, the Company founded a small settlement on Gaya Island (Pulau Gaya), which was already inhabited by the Bajau people. In 1897, this first settlement was burned and destroyed by Bajau rebels led by Mat Salleh.\nAfter the rebellion, the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya. A nearby fishing village named \"Api-Api\" (see \"Original names\" below), was the next settlement of the Company. This new location was then designated as the main harbour and port, as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway. It was expanded and renamed \"Jesselton\", named after Sir Charles Jessel, the then Vice Chairman of the Company.\nEventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbour. Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon, and the Company worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region.\nJesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Rebellions against the Japanese military administration have taken place in Api. One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas, consisting of local inhabitants. The rebellion was however quelled by the Japanese forces, after their leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10, 1945.\nAfter the war, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946. The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan, which had also been destroyed by the war.\nWhen North Borneo together with Sarawak, Singapore &amp; Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital. Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30, 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2, 2000.\nEtymology.\nKota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu, about 90\u00a0kilometres east-northeast of the city. The meaning and origin of the name \"Kinabalu\" is uncertain. One theory suggests it means \"Chinese widow\", where \"Kina\" meaning \"Chinese\" (person) in Kadazandusun language, and \"balu\" meaning \"widow\" in Malay language. This theory derives from a folk tale about a Chinese prince who came to the mountain in search of a giant pearl which was guarded by a dragon at the top of the mountain. While he was here, he married a local woman but later returned to China and left the woman heartbroken. Alternatively, it is also argued that \"Kinabalu\" or \"Akinabalu\" is the name of the dragon which guards the giant pearl itself. Another theory suggests that the term is derived from the name \"Aki Nabalu\" meaning the \"revered place of the dead\", in which, \"Aki\" means \"ancestors\" or \"grandfather\", and \"Nabalu\" being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language. Finally there is also a source claiming that the term originated from \"Ki Nabalu\", where \"Ki\" meaning \"have\" or \"exist\", and \"Nabalu\" meaning \"spirit of the dead\".\n\"Kota\" is a Malay word for a \"fort\", \"town\", or a \"city\". It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, Kota Bahru, Kota Tinggi, and Kota Kemuning. It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Henceforth, a direct translation of the name \"Kota Kinabalu\" into English would be \"City of Kinabalu\" or \"Kinabalu City\".\nOriginal names.\nBesides Jesselton, there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular, as mentioned above, is \"Api-Api\", or sometimes simply \"Api\", which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'. It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh, as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates. There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called \"Sungai Api-Api\". Another theory states that \"Api-Api\" is the local name of the common \"Avicennia\" tree that grows in abundance around the area. Transliterated into the formal Chinese name of \"Ya Bi\" (\u4e9a\u5e87 y\u00e0 b\u00ec), the Hakkas here too adopted this name (\u4e9a\u5e87,\"ah-bi\" which pronounced in Hakka, Chinese dialects) and some still use this name to this day. Besides Api-Api, another suggested historical name was \"Deasoka\", which roughly means \"below the coconut tree\" in the Bajau language. The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Another name was \"Singgah Mata\" which literally mean \"transit eye\", but can be loosely translated as meaning \"pleasing to the eye\". It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center. Today, all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are: \"Lintasan Deasoka\", \"Api-Api Centre\", \"Jalan Singgah Mata\", and \"Jesselton Point\".\nCapital city.\nBeing the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population in the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based. Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is at nearby Likas Bay. There are four Members of Parliament (MPs) representing four parliamentary constituencies in the city: Sepanggar (\"P.171\"), Kota Kinabalu (\"P.172\"), Putatan (\"P.173\"), and Penampang (\"P.174\"). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, and Moyog.\nSister cities.\nKota Kinabalu currently has five sister cities.\nTransportation.\nLand.\nThe internal roads linking different parts of the city are generally state roads constructed and maintained by the state Public Works Department. Most major internal roads are dual-carriageways. One of the major road here is Jalan Lintas-Jalan Tuaran Bypass, which together serves almost as a ring road, circling the city and connecting the districts and suburbs surrounding the city, namely, Putatan, Penampang, Luyang, Likas, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar, and Tuaran. There is currently no freeway in the city nor in any part of Sabah. The city is linked by highways to distant towns around Sabah and these are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. Highway routes from Kota Kinabalu include:\nPublic transportation:\nRegular bus services operate around the city. Minibuses or vans are also used besides buses as an alternative public transportation. There are two main bus terminals in the central business area. The terminal along Jalan Tun Razak provides internal bus services towards different part of the city and its outskirts. Another terminal near Bandaran Berjaya provides intercity services towards destinations south of the city (Papar, Tenom, Beaufort, and others). The Kota Kinabalu (North) Bus Terminal in Inanam provides intercity buses heading towards destinations north and north-east of the city (Tuaran, Kudat, Ranau, Sandakan, Tawau, Semporna, and others). Taxicabs too are around the city.\nA railway system formerly known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the interior to the port in Kota Kinabalu during the British occupation. The railway line connects Kota Kinabalu with Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today the railway is known as Sabah State Railway, and it provides daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the \"North Borneo Railway\", which caters mainly for tourists. The train station and terminus are in Tanjung Aru.\nAir.\nKota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) provides flights linking the city with other domestic and international destinations. It is a secondary hub for Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia and it consists of two terminals. It is the second busiest airport in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur International Airport and it is a major gateway into Sabah and East Malaysia. It serves international flights to Bandar Seri Begawan, Shenzhen, Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Cebu, Singapore, Taibei, Gaoxiong, and other domestic cities. It is also a secondary hub for MASWings, which serves flights to smaller towns and rural areas in East Malaysia.\nSea.\nKota Kinabalu has two ports: Kota Kinabalu Port and Sepanggar Bay Container Port (SBCP). Kota Kinabalu Port mainly loose/bulk cargo, while SBCP operates as a naval base for the Royal Malaysian Navy, oil depot and all containerised cargo. In 2004, Kota Kinabalu Port handled about 3.6 million tonnes of freight cargo, the third highest in the state after Sandakan Port, and Tawau Port. It however handles the most number of containers in the state, with 153,793\u00a0twenty-foot equivalent units\u00a0(TEU) of containers handled in 2006. Sepanggar Bay Port will have the capacity to handle 200,000\u00a0TEU annually when its container terminal is completed. All ports in Sabah are managed and operated by Sabah Ports Sdn Bhd.\nKota Kinabalu Ferry Terminal is a passenger ferry terminal at Jesselton Point near the K.K. port. It provides ferry and motorboat services to the nearby islands for tourists as well as for commuters living on the islands. There are also regular scheduled ferry services to Labuan."}

At the beginning this temple was dedicated to Jupiter alone, it was built in the mid 2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being worked on - this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii was at its height and so Roman Jupiter beat out the Greek Apollo and Jupiter(, Juno, and Minerva) in towns newly taken over by the Romans. This was also true for Pompeii, where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over.\nPompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in 310 BC. It was still allowed to mostly run itself, however, until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC.\nThe building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks, but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style. As opposed to the previous Samnite rulers of Pompeii, the Romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life. Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place. Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city. \nThe temple had been built in 150 BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum, and it became Pompeii's main temple after Rome took over. The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple, which held the statues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and which only the priests were allowed to enter.\nIn 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii, destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter. After this, the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main place of worship to Jupiter and his group of three (). The first Temple of Jupiter was still waiting to be fixed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79, burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash. The hollow temple can still be seen in Pompeii today. also in pompeii the had intercoure (sex) on the porch that indicated wealth. "}

It has a pointed face and it is about the size of a rabbit. Once thought to be extinct, it is listed as being critically endangered.It is the most endangered mammal and marsupial in the whole of Australia. There are only about 40 of the animals now left in the world. Gilbert's potoroo is one of the world's rarest mammals.\nThey live in a small area, about , on the southwest coast near Albany, Western Australia. This area is in the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Gilbert's Potoroos have been released on nearby Bald Island, and are breeding successfully.\nDiscovery.\nThe first scientific discovery of the Gilbert\u2019s potoroo happened in 1840, and it was named in 1841 after the English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert. Gilbert had collected several animals at King George Sound in Australia, including this potoroo. Gilbert\u2019s potoroo was not seenagain for many years, even though many people had searched for them in the 1970s. The species was believed to be extinct for 120 years before it was re-discovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Liz Sinclair had been studying wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps.\nHabitat.\nPotoroos live under thick bushes and shrubs. They have made tunnels and paths through the bush so they can get around easily. When moving slowly they use all four legs, but to move quickly they can hop like a kangaroo. Potoroos are nocturnal and they spend their days hiding. They only come out into the open very often. They live in small groups of between three to five animals. They eat different kinds of truffles and fungi. Australia has many different kinds of truffles and potoroos like to eat many of them. Potoroos have sharp three toed claws that help them dig into the ground to find the truffles growing in the soil. After eating them, the potoroos help spread the seeds of the truffles through their wastes. Scientists have found 40 different types of fungi in the waste from a Gilbert Potoroo.\nReproduction.\nThe female potoroos can have two babies in a year, but only carry one at a time. They can keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing. If the first baby does not survive, the second baby can start growing right away. It is not known how long gestation is for Gilbert\u2019s potoroo, but it is thought to be the same as the long-nosed potoroo; about 38 days. The baby potoroo is only about long when it is born. It lives in its mother's pouch for about 4 months.\nSaving the potoroo.\nWhen Gilbert\u2019s potoroo was rediscovered, more animals were captured to start a breeding program. This would help increase the numbers of potoroos. A few young were born in the first couple of years, but then breeding just stopped. Many studies have looked at what they eat, and how they live, but they are still can not get the potoroos to breed in captivity\nIn 2001, a group was formed called the Gilbert\u2019s potoroo Action Group (GPAG). This group helps educate and tell people about the potoroo. It also helps with raising money for more study and captive breeding programs for Gilbert\u2019s potoroo.\nThree potoroos, one male and two females, were moved to Bald Island in August 2005. This island is free from other animals, like cats and foxes, that would eat the potoroos. Since then, four more potoroos have been sent to start a breeding colony.\nThere is a lot of danger for the survival of Gilbert's potoroo. Because of the small area where they live, they could be lost in a bushfire. Foxes and cats could easily kill all the potoroos. There may not be enough potoroos to give them enough genetic differences to survive a virus. There is not enough natural bushland at Two Peoples Bay, and there is too much cleared land next to the nature reserve."}

It is of spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The term \"yellow dwarf\" is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars. See spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type. \nGV stars are small (about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 K. Like other main-sequence stars, a GV star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion.\nOur Sun is the most commonly known (and most easily seen) example of a GV star. Each second, it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy. Other GV stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.\nOur own Sun looks yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering. Without that, it would look white. Even though the name \"dwarf\" is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90% brighter than all of the stars in the Milky Way (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs).\nA GV star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around 10 billion years. After the hydrogen is used up, the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like Aldebaran. Eventually the red giant will lose its outer layers of gas, which will become a planetary nebula, while the inside of the star (also known as the core) will cool and shrink into a small, very dense white dwarf."}

The ballet was choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska and the music and words were written by Igor Stravinsky. The music is written for voices, four pianos, and percussion.\nThe ballet was first presented on 13 June 1923 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Ga\u00eete-Lyr\u00eequ\u00e9 in Paris. The ballet is sometimes called a \"dance cantata\", and the music is sometimes performed as a concert piece.\nBackground.\nIn 1915 ballet producer Sergei Diaghilev wanted to create a ballet called \"La Liturgie\". Its background would be the Greek Orthodox Church. Stravinsky was a strong Christian, and did not want to write this ballet. He turned instead to Russian folk songs for \"Les Noces\". He had started to think about this in 1913. Michel Fokine started the choreography but Vaslav Nijinsky took over. Leonide Massine stepped in for Nijinsky. When Massine left, Bronislava Nijinska designed the dancing.\nDesign for the ballet (sets and clothing) was done by Natalia Goncharova. Goncharova, an outstanding artist, made two complete designs before her third was accepted. The first two designs were rejected because they did not suit either the dancing or the musical score. The ballet, though based on a folk tale, was modernist in style: Stravinsky and Nijinska thought it was important for its design to be in sympathy with this.\nStory.\nThe bride, Nastasia, is having her hair done. She complains that it hurts when pulled. The choir sing to her about how beautiful her life will be with her husband, F\u00e9tis. The nightingales will sing to them in the garden. The choir sings to the Virgin Mary. They sing about the husband-to-be and his fair hair. They ask for a blessing for the young couple. The actual marriage ceremony is not seen. In the last of the four scenes, we see the wedding feast. The people are happy and start to get drunk. The husband and wife are led to the bedroom.\nRevivals.\nThe ballet is still in the repertoires of some major ballet companies, such as the Royal Ballet. It was performed in 1936 by Colonel de Basil's \"Ballets Russes\", one of the successor companies to that of Diaghilev. Its post-WWII revival in London (1966) was personally supervised by Nijinska. Because of this, the ballet is still danced to its original choreography. It was also performed at Stuttgart (1974) and Paris (1976). Jerome Robbins choreographed it in the American Ballet Theatre version of 1965."}

It is the capital city of the Nord-Est \"D\u00e9partement\".\nThe city is on the \"Baie de Fort-Libert\u00e9\" (\"Fort-Libert\u00e9 Bay\") about 56\u00a0km east of Cap-Ha\u00eftien and to the west of the Dominican Republic. It is also the chief town of an \"arrondissement\" (a part of a department) with the same name. The \"arrondissement\" has three \"communes\" (a \"commune\" is like a municipality): Fort-Libert\u00e9, Ferrier (Krey\u00f2l: \"Ferye\") and Perches (Krey\u00f2l: \"Op\u00e8ch\").\nHistory.\nBetween 1503 and 1505, Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of \"Puerto Real\" (English, \"Royal Port\") where is the present town of \"Caracol\", to the west of Fort-Libert\u00e9. But soon this town was abandoned and the people moved to the east, founding in 1578 a new town with the Ta\u00edno name of the region: Bayaj\u00e1.\nIn 1606, those persons living in the old Spanish towns of Bayaj\u00e1 and Yaguana had, by orders of the Spanish king, to move to the eastern part of the island, to a new town called Bayaguana, combining the two old names.\nLater, when French people founded a new town in this place, they called it Fort-Dauphin in 1731, named after the \"Dauphin\" (the \"Dolphin\", son of the French king Louis XV). When the French Republic was founded, the name was changed to \"Fort-Libert\u00e9\" in 1792. After Henri Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti in 1811, he renamed the city Fort-Royal. In 1820, after the death of Christophe, the name was changed back to Fort Libert\u00e9.\nForts around Fort-Libert\u00e9.\nThere are several forts built around the bay. An important one is \"Fort Dauphin\", sometimes called \"Fort Saint Joseph\" (Patron Saint of the city) or \"Fort Libert\u00e9\". Other forts in the area are \"Fort de la Bouque\", \"Batterie de l'Anse\", \"Fort Saint Charles\" and \"Fort Saint Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique\".\nEconomy.\nFort-Libert\u00e9 has a small port that also receives international products and serves as a fishing port.

He collected animal specimens for English naturalist John Gould. Australia's rarest animal, Gilbert's Potoroo, \"Potorous gilberti\", and the Gilbert-Einasleigh River were named after him.\nEarly life.\nGilbert was born on 14 March, but the exact year is not known. It must have been between 1810 and 1815 and so most books use 1812. Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London. He met English naturalist John Gould and went to Australia in 1838 with Gould. Gould paid him \u00a3100 a year to collect and preserve animals and birds for him\nAustralia.\nGould and Gilbert arrived in Hobart on the ship \"Parsee\" on 19 September 1838. They were going to collect animal and bird specimens for Gould's books. Both worked in Tasmania for a few months. On 4 February 1839, Gilbert went to the Swan River settlement. He worked there for a year, mainly around Perth, collecting for Gould. Gilbert then sailed for Sydney, and in June 1840 took a ship to Port Essington in the north of Australia. In March 1841 he sailed to Singapore, stopping at Timor on the way. From there he sailed for London and arrived at the end of September. He had collected a very large number of birds for Gould, and made many notes on their habits. \nIn February 1842 Gilbert returned Australia to collect further specimens. He reached Perth in July and stayed for 17 months in Western Australia. He made his most interesting discoveries among the Wongan Hills, about 100 miles north-east of Perth. He was a fine naturalist and his notes on birds, their habits, diet, song and the names given them by the aborigines were all of great interest and value. Gilbert collected specimens of 432 birds, including 36 species new to Western Australia. He collected 318 mammals, including 22 species not previously known in the west. By the end of January 1844 he was back in Sydney and during the next six months worked his way to the Darling Downs in Queensland.\nExplorer.\nGilbert joined Ludwig Leichhardt's expedition in September 1844 which was going to cross Australia's north, from Brisbane to Port Essington. Gilbert, with his experience in the Australian bush, was unofficially the second in charge. The journey was much slower than planned and food supplies were getting low. On 28 June 1845, near the Gulf of Carpentaria, Gilbert was killed when aborigines attacked the explorers. He was buried at the site, but the grave has never been found. The rest of the group reached Port Essington in December 1845.\nLeichhardt kept Gilbert's papers and his diary, which, however, was lost for nearly 100 years before its discovery by A. H. Chisholm. Chisholm's research showed Gilbert as a man of much ability and fine character who somewhat ironically had a great respect for the aboriginals. There is a memorial to him in St James church, Sydney with the Latin phrase \"Dulce et decorum est pro scientia mori\" - \"it is sweet and fitting to die for science.\""}

The locals, the \"Malikun\", call their island \"Maliku,\" as do the Maldivians, the closest Maldive island to Minicoy is Thuraakunu. Since 1956, the Indian Government has forbidden contact between people of the same nationals of the two islands despite their geographic proximity and ethnographic similarities. The cultural traits of Minicoy differ from those of any other Indian islands of Lakshadweep. Manners, customs and food are similar to those of the Maldives to the south of Minicoy and Mahl, a dialect of Dhivehi, is the language spoken on the island. This language employs the T\u0101na script, written from right to left. Minicoy Islanders, like the close islands of the Maldives follow Sunni Islam. The islands were probably Buddhist before like they were in the Maldives. In August 1947 the possessions of the Emperor of British India passed to either the Indian Union or Pakistan according to an agreed demarcation line. The rulers of the independent countries that were vassals of the Emperor had the choice of acceding to either the Dominion of India or Pakistan.\nWhile Maliku was a sovereign possession of the Emperor and not that of an independent country such as, Kashmir or Hyderabad State, it is unclear why India felt it necessary to hold a plebiscite in Maliku in 1956 to determine whether or not the people of Maliku wished to join the Indian Union. However Since 1965 Pakistan wished Maliku to return to the Republic of Maldives."}

Razvi was politically powerful and a close advisor of the Nizam, whom he encouraged to defy the infidel government, and blocked the invasion of Hyderabad into Republic of India. At the height of the crisis, Razvi had placed his allies in influential posts, and was virtually dictating the Nizam's policy on the issue. Razvi even traveled to Delhi and had a stormy meeting with Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He is quoted to have said \"Death with the sword in hand, is always preferable to extinction by a mere stroke of the pen. \"prompting the Indian government to call him the \"Nizam's Frankenstein monster.\"\nAfter Indian military intervention, Razvi was placed under house arrest and tried under Indian laws on seditious activities and inciting communal violence.

The politics of the force were intermingled with jihad, the religious war or holy war of Muhammad 1400 years earlier. However, the war between Pakistan and Bengali separatists was a nationalistic war, not a religious one.\nBackground.\nOn March 27, 1971, after beginning the Pakistani Civil War, Pakistani military forces needed military support from Bengali nationalists supporters who still wanted to be part of Pakistan, or did not like Indian involvement in the movement; as well as the non-Bengali muhajirs in order to abolish the independence fighters of Bangladesh, the Mukti Bahini, Hemayet Bahini and Kaderiya Bahini. \nThe Al Badar were formed to find these independence fighters and to be guides as well as co-fighters who were familiar with the local terrain.

His party was renamed the National Conference in 1939 to suite the secular nature of Kashmiri culture. The All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, led by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, espoused a secular ideology and wished to create a secular, democratic but independent Kashmir with close ties to British India. \nWhen the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was converted into a secular political party in 1939, the Muslim leaders amended the Constitution of the Muslim Conference, renamed it as the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, modified its objectives and threw its membership open to all the people of the State. On 13 June 1941, the breakaway factions of the National Conference revived the erstwhile Muslim Conference under the leadership of Choudry Ghualm Abbas. \nThe All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference led the Muslim movement for accession into Pakistans favor in the State. \nOn July 19, 1947, a convention of All Jammu &amp; Kashmir Muslim Conference, adopted the \"Accession to Pakistan Resolution\" demanding accession of the Kashmir state to Pakistan. \nIn 1955 the All-Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was the political party in power in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

However, many see some degree of autonomy as a stepping stone towards this, and are supportive of the Cornish Assembly Campaign.

Yorkshire Television broadcasts to Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Yorkshire Television has made successful programmes such as Emmerdale, Heartbeat, The Beiderbecke Trilogy, Rising Damp, Harry's Game, The Darling Buds of May, Only When I Laugh and Duty Free. Yorkshire Television also produces the Calander news programme.\nThe headquarters of Yorkshire Television are at The Leeds Studios in the Burley area of Leeds.\nIdentity.\nFor almost 35 years, Yorkshire Television's on-screen identity always revolved around the use of the station logo: the chevron. This yellow symbol was seen on nearly all of Yorkshire Television's idents and presentation. The first symbol used was a black and white chevron, formed by slit-scan techniques and accompanied by an orchestral version of the tune \"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\", a famous Yorkshire folk song. This music was later to become the station's jingle. This ident continued until Yorkshire Television officially commenced their colour broadcasts in November 1969.\nThe new colour ident featured the yellow chevron on a black background with the still caption card \"Yorkshire Television Colour Production\", along with a simplified version of \"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\". This ident was modified in 1981, so that the caption \"Colour Production\" was changed to \"In Colour\", and in 1982 the colour caption was removed altogether. The new version of the jingle was at a lower pitch than was previously composed.\nSupplementing the ident throughout this period were idents promoting the station's coverage, with the slogan \"Serving Six Million Viewers\". One version, in 1983 featured a giant chevron logo, made up out of smaller chevrons, and another in 1986 featured the view zooming in from space, to the Yorkshire TV region, which then flipped over, becoming the chevron. This last version was computer animated, with 3D-style lettering and chevron.\nOn 5 January 1987, Yorkshire Television introduced a new ident, entitled \"Liquid Gold\", featuring a pool of liquified gold, with the chevron rising up from it, and rotating into the sky, where the station name joins it. This ident features a fully orchestrated version of the theme tune and reportedly cost \u00a340,000 to make. This was occasionally supplemented by a large rotating chevron over a gradient-ed blue background, used over continuity.\nOn 1 September 1989, Yorkshire Television adopted the first ITV generic look, featuring the large ITV logo, addition ident was also used where a static chevron on the same background as the main ident. On 7 January 1991, the ident was revised to allow the Chevron to appear full screen instead of being a segment of the 'V' which the company used until 23 October 1994. The whole package was used by Yorkshire Television, and an adapted version, where the whole chevron appeared in the V segment before moving into centre screen, was used before regional programming.\n1990s.\nUpon YTV dropping the generic look on 24 October 1994, a new ident was introduced, featuring a textured background with a central strip containing images of the region itself, with the chevron placed in the centre of said strip. The most noticeable thing about this ident set was the smooth nature of the chevron's appearance and, like the previous look, did not feature the \"\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\" \"jingle, instead favouring a smooth orchestral jingle. The background was later changed from a cream to a light blue, and variations on the theme for special occasions and yearly themes were also introduced.\nYorkshire-Tyne Tees Television adopted a new branding package, based on the concept of Channel 3. The new look was fully implemented in the Tyne Tees region on 2 September 1996, where all on-screen branding was replaced by giant numeral '3', and the Tyne Tees brand became secondary to 'Channel 3 North East, however the look was only partially implemented in the Yorkshire region a month after Tyne Tees's revamp. The entirety of Yorkshire's Channel 3 look included an ident which was later introduced on 4 November 1996 at the same year, where the chevron span against a light blue background with numeral '3's covering the background. Another ident featured the chevron with the '3' numeral embossed on the side, which would zoom into view, before revealing a spinning numeral 3, which in turn had YTV chevron on the middle of the 3 and when zoomed into, the chevron re-appeared spinning against the background. The look also heralded the return of the \"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\" tune, which was now noticeably higher in pitch.\nThe Channel 3 look was dropped on 9 March 1998, following Granada's acquisition of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, with the look returning to a spinning chevron against a misty blue background, light blue during the day and dark blue in the evenings.\nOn 8 November 1999, Yorkshire Television adopted the second generic look, based on the theme of hearts, which was used for the entirety of the branding period before network programming. However, for local programming, Yorkshire created their own ident featuring a background of spinning chevrons, with pictures of the region featuring inside a central box. \n2000s.\nOn 28 October 2002, the brand was dropped in favour of a national ITV1 identity, in which local regional identities were dropped except before local programming, when the Yorkshire name appeared below the ITV1 logo only. These regional idents however were dropped by 2006."}

She was born as a slave, but escaped from slavery in 1826. She was born Isabella Baumfree, but renamed herself to 'Sojourner Truth' when she was 46 and announced she would travel to work against injustice.The name Sojourner Truth translates as itinerant preacher. She is one of the most widely known African American women of the 19th century. Her freedom was linked with the passage of a New York State Law in 1799 that began the process of gradual emancipation.\nShe lectured widely on the cruelties she had experienced as a slave. She is best known for her \"Ain't I a Woman?\" speech, given at the Woman's Rights Convention of 1851. She also gave out speeches about abolishing slavery. Also, she became active in the Underground Railroad, helping blacks escape to freedom. She could only speak Dutch and at a young age soon learnt English. Sadly, she was beaten for not understanding the commands of her owners John and Sally Dumont. There is evidence that John beat her and Sally sexually abused her. \nEarly Life.\nIsabella Baumfree (Sojourner Truth) was born into slavery around 1797 in Swarterkill, New York. Sojourner was the daughter of James Baumfree and Elizabeth Baumfree. Her family\u2019s slave owner was Colonel Hardenbergh. Sojourner was born a slave and did not know how to read or write because nobody taught slaves how to. Out of 13 children, she was the youngest. In the first three decades of her life she was the property of five owners.It is In 1815 she dated fellow slave Thomas. Together they had 3 children. Her family was separated in 1806. In 1826 Isabella escaped to freedom with her infant daughter. Sojourner changed her name in 1843 from Isabella Baumfree to Sojourner Truth. She married and bore five children although only four of their names are known. She never learned to read or write and depended on others to take down her words while handling her correspondences. \nSojourner was the first African American to win a trial against a white man. This trial was about getting her son Peter back. This was a great accomplishment for African Americans. During the Civil War Belle told the people about the Woman's Right to vote and became friends with some other people, which one of them threaten that she would not support the issue.She campaigned for Republican Ulysses S. Grant. She was one of the prominent Americans that attempted to vote in the 1872 election but was refused the right to. She went on to support herself by selling copies of her book, \u201cThe Narrative of Sojourner Truth \u201c. During that time, she was a Battle Creek resident and property owner.

{"id": "193941", "revid": "803287", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193941", "title": "Instant Runoff Voting", "text": "Instant runoff voting is a method of electing one political candidate to office from a list of more than two, but it can also be used for other group decisions. Voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite, with only their top choices being counted each time. Ballots are counted, and a series of simulated rounds is conducted. If no candidate has a majority of the votes in any round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and those voters' next choice votes are then counted. This is repeated until a candidate has a majority.\nInstant runoff voting has been used in Australia's lower house for more than 80 years. That house is strongly dominated by two parties. It has also been used to elect mayors in some cities in the United States. Voter turn out is typically the same as with plurality voting.\nProponents believe instant runoff voting allows them to vote for their first choice candidate and still help the lessor of evils if the first choice is eliminated. They believe Instant Runoff Voting to be the only way let voters vote their true intentions and undermine the two-party system. By having more candidates on the ballot, incumbents are more likely to be kicked out of office.\nOpponents argue that if at least three candidates have a chance of winning, voting for one's favorite could cause a compromise candidate to lose in the first round. Their favorite might then lose against the least preferred candidate in the second round. Voters' votes cannot be transferred to their second choice if their second choice is eliminated before their first choice is. Voters often use their first choice vote for a compromise vote, the same as with plurality.\nWhile theoretically simple, instant runoff voting often requires computers because the rankings on each ballot matter for determining the elimination order and can not be counted in aggregate. Opponents of Instant runoff voting often oppose computer counting of ballots, since it is difficult for ordinary citizens to count the ballots by hand and catch any fraud. The fact that a candidate has fewer votes does not mean the candidate is less popular but that the candidate was squeezed out on both sides of the political spectrum. Instant runoff voting can eliminate centrists in the last elimination."}

It was designed during the 1960s. The Harrier is well known as it can take off vertically. It can do this by changing the direction of thrust from its engines. It is sometimes called V/STOL, which means \"Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing\". It can carry heavier loads with a short takeoff than with a vertical one.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1967, the Bristol Engine Company proposed the radical idea of a directed thrust engine. Next, Hawker Aircraft designed an aeroplane that could meet the NATO specification for a \"light tactical support fighter\". There was no financial support for the development from HM Treasury, but support was found from NATO.\nA prototype flew in 1960. Various changes were made and several preliminary versions flew including the \"Kestrel\" and the first Harriers flew for the RAF and Royal Navy in 1969. The planes were built in both Britain and the United States. They were redeveloped and manufactured by British Aerospace and Macdonald Douglas, companies which are now owned by BAE Systems and Boeing, respectively. At present the Boeing/BAE Systems AV-8B Harrier II is used by NATO countries such as the United States, Spain and Italy. A modified version, the BAE Systems/Boeing Harrier II is used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy.\nBetween 1969 and 2003, 824 Harrier variants were delivered. Manufacture of new Harriers ended in 1997. The last remanufactured aircraft (Harrier II Plus configuration) was delivered in December 2003. This ended the Harrier production line.\nUsers.\nThe Harrier is used by many military forces. The United States Marine Corps and the Royal Air Force (RAF) use versions which are specially designed for taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. Other countries which use the Harrier include Thailand and India.\nIn 2006, the RAF introduced a new version of the Harrier, the GR/9. This is an updated version of the previous version, the GR/7. It has a top speed of 574 knots.\nThe Harrier was used a lot during the Falklands War. Harriers flew a total of 1,561 sorties, shot down 20 enemy planes (+ 3 probables) with 10 Harriers lost. Of the ten lost, six were shot down; the others were damaged in accidents on the carrier. The Sea Harriers made the Argentine Air Force much less effective than they hoped to be.\nEquipment.\nThe Harrier can carry different equipment for each mission. It can carry missiles and bombs. It can also carry cameras to take pictures of the ground."}

He also wrote books and articles, edited texts, translated books from German to English, and published poetry books.\nLife.\nBarthold Fles was born in Amsterdam on February 7, 1902. His family was Jewish but did not keep Jewish laws. His father, Louis Fles, thought that it was wrong for Jews and other people to be religious. Louis Fles imported typewriters and sold them, in addition to other office products, in several stores that he owned and to other stores. Barthold was his oldest son so his father wanted him to help him at work. Barthold did not want to work for his father. He only wanted to read. Barthold read in Dutch, German, English, and French. He read a lot and very fast. Barthold found a job at De Lange publishers. In 1923 he left for the United States.\nIn New York Fles first worked as a violinist, painting apartments, selling vacuum cleaners and for publishers. In 1933 he started his own business, a \"literary agency\", in Manhattan, New York. As a \"literary agent\" he mostly helped writers find publishers. He also sold stories for films or magazines and would find a writer to make a book that a publisher wanted. When Barthold started working as a literary agent, many of his clients were people who left Germany for the United States because of the Nazism in Germany. He held meetings for these writers in New York so that they could learn about publishing books and stories in the United States. Later, however, most of the writers he worked with were born in the United States.\nIn 1936 Barthold married Ruth Gr\u00fcnwald, a dancer at the Metropolitan Opera who had been just one year in the United States. Ruth helped Barthold with his work. Later she left him. Although he had no children of his own, Barthold Fles wrote two books for kids: \"Slavonic rhapsody: the life of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\" (in 1948) and \"East Germany\" (in 1973). He also wrote many articles and introductions to story collections. He translated three books from German to English. One of these books, Bambi's Children by Felix Salten, was also a book for children.\nIn 1986, when he was 84 years old, Fles stopped working. He went back to the Netherlands, and lived three years in a home for retired artists. He died on December 19, 1989 at the age of 87.\nBooks.\nTranslated.\nPublished.\nThese German poetry books were published by Barthold Fles Verlag, New York"}

A folder is a storage space, or container, where many files can be placed into groups and organize the computer. A folder can also contain other folders. For many computer software applications, there is a current working directory. This is the folder that the application runs in. In Unix and Linux, a directory is a special type of file.\nFolders can be put together to make a \"filesystem\" and are laid out like a tree. The folders inside folders are like branches and sub-branches off the tree trunk. This idea is used by the software to allow the user to navigate the folders. A computer file, such as a spreadsheet or music file can only be in one folder directly. This folder, however, can be inside other folders. On some operating systems, shortcuts or links can be made from one folder to another to make it appear that one file or folder is contained in two different parent folders. On Unix systems, this is called a \"symbolic link\", and is similar in function to a hyperlink.\nFolders are inspired by a real-life item called a file folder."}

In 1941 Britten started to feel homesick because he read an article by E.M.Forster about George Crabbe, a poet who had lived in the same part of England that Britten came from. Britten started to realize that, in order to compose well, he had to go back to his own country. Britten and Pears returned to England in 1942.\nThe conductor Sergei Koussevitzky asked Britten to write an opera based on a poem by George Crabbe. The poem, called \u201cThe Borough\u201d, was about the story of Peter Grimes. The village in the poem was fictitious, but it was very much like Aldeburgh where Britten later made his home. Britten asked Montagu Slater to write the libretto based on the story of Crabbe\u2019s poem.\nThe opera was first performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London on 7 June 1945 by the company which later became English National Opera. The conductor was Reginald Goodall. Pears sang the title role.\nThe first American performance was in 1946 at Tanglewood conducted by Koussevitzky's pupil, Leonard Bernstein. Britten dedicated it to Koussevitsky\u2019s wife.\nSynopsis.\nPrologue.\nThe first young boy who was an apprentice to Peter Grimes has already been killed. He was at sea for three days without water to drink. An inquest is being held to decide whether Grimes is guilty of the boy\u2019s death. The people all seem to think he is guilty. The judge decides that the boy\u2019s death was an accident. However, he says to Grimes that he should not get another apprentice. Grimes is very angry at being told this. Ellen Orford, a school teacher, comforts him. In their beautiful duet Ellen and Peter sing at first in different keys, but finally sing together in the same key.\nAct 1.\nThe scenery shows the Moot Hall, the Boar Inn (the village pub) and the church. People are saying \u201cGood morning\u201d to one another, especially the Slave Master who says it many times. The fishermen start work mending their nets. Keene tells Grimes that he has found another apprentice for him. He is a poor boy who lives in the workhouse. Nobody wants Grimes to have another apprentice. Hobson, the cart man, refuses to fetch him. But Ellen supports Peter. She sings to the crowd: \u201cLet her among you without fault cast the first stone\u201d (meaning: \u201cYou all have faults so do not criticize\u201d). Hobson goes off to get the boy. A terrible storm is coming.\nThe scene now changes to The Boar Inn. It is very noisy inside. Bob Boles gets drunk and wants to make love to the landlady\u2019s nieces. The storm is still raging outside. Grimes comes in. People are shocked, but Grimes does not notice. He sings and song about human fate: \u201cNow the Great Bear and Pleiades\u201d. The tune is in the orchestra in canon while Grimes sings very simple lines of music. People are embarrassed, so they start to sing a round: \u201cOld Joe has gone fishing\u201d. It has three tunes and has seven counts in a bar. The boy is brought in and Grimes takes him off in spite of the storm.\nAct 2.\nThe opening of the next act is peaceful. It is Sunday morning. People are in church, and now again we hear the singing coming from the church. Ellen talks to the boy. She is horrified to see he has a bruise on his neck. Grimes says it was an accident. He gets annoyed that Ellen is worried about the boy and runs off with him. The people of the village have noticed and march up to Grimes\u2019s hut. The scene ends with a peaceful contrast: a duet sung by the two nieces.\nThe orchestra play a beautiful passacaglia which links to the next scene. Grimes is accusing the boy of \u201ctelling stories\u201d. Then he starts to feels guilty about the first boy\u2019s death. He hears the villagers coming and tells the boy they have to go fishing. He pushes him out onto the rocks and the boy falls to his death. When the villagers arrive at the hut they find it empty.\nAct 3.\nAct 3 opens with music describing moonlight at night. People are dancing in the Moot Hall. People are very merry. Mrs. Sedley tries to tell people that Grimes is a murderer, but they do not listen. People then start to leave, saying \u201cGoodnight\u201d to one another (especially the Rector). Balstrode is walking with Ellen. He tells her that Grimes\u2019s boat is in, but Grimes cannot be found. A boy\u2019s jersey has been washed up on the shore. Ellen sings an aria \u201cEmbroidery in childhood was a luxury of idleness\u201d. It is a moment of stillness in the drama.\nA short interlude based on one chord leads to the next scene in which people are looking for Grimes. Grimes drags himself onto the shore. He seems to have gone mad. We hear a foghorn (played by an off-stage tuba) as he sings. Balstrode tells Grimes that he should go out to sea in his boat and sink it.\nEpilogue.\nThe opera ends with an epilogue in which the scene is the same as the beginning of the opera. Someone says that a boat has been seen sinking out to sea, but no one is interested. The people have forgotten Grimes, and continue their lives without him."}

He became a plumber and firefighter. He never talked to anybody about his experiences in the trenches. When he was 100 years old he decided he should tell people about what he had seen in the war. He still had 11 more years to live after that. When he died at the age of 111 he was the last British person who had fought in the First World War. This is why he was known as \"the Last Tommy\".

For many of the people there it was a last opportunity to pay respects to the people who fought in the war.\nExperiences.\nHarry decided to talk about his experiences because he wanted everyone to realize how terrible wars are.

He remembered the Bible story about Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with God's commandment, 'thou shalt not kill'. He could not bring himself to kill the German. Instead, he shot him in the shoulder, which made him drop his rifle. But the German carried on running towards Patch's gun, so he then shot him above the knee, and in the ankle.

They were done by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. Milgram wanted to find out how easy it was to get someone to follow orders, even if the orders went against their conscience. In his experiment, a test subject was ordered by a scientist to inflict electric shocks on another person, though the shocks were faked.\nTo his surprise, most subjects did as they were told until the very end of the experiment, though many found it difficult. There have been many repetitions and variations of the experiment, with similar results.\nThe experiment.\nParticipants were told they would be helping out in a \"learning experiment\". The participant played the role of a \"teacher\" in which they had to ask questions to the \"learner\". Every time the learner got a question wrong or failed to answer, the teacher had to press a switch to give the learner an electric shock. The voltage increased each time. In the original version of the experiment, the teacher and learner were in separate rooms, but could talk to each other through the wall.\nIn fact, the electric shocks were faked. The \"learners\" were actually actors, who only pretended to be in pain. As the \"shocks\" increased, their cries of pain grew louder. They protested, banged the wall and stopped answering the questions. The shocks eventually reached levels that would have been deadly had they been real. At this point, the learner fell silent.\nMuch was done to trick the subjects into thinking it was real. When they arrived, they were told that the actor was another volunteer and that the \"teacher\" and \"learner\" roles would be decided at random by drawing slips of paper. In fact, both slips of paper said \"teacher\", so the actor pretended to have picked \"learner\". The electric shock machine made buzzing noises and could give an actual mild shock of 45 volts. The teacher would try this out before the experiment began.\nIf at any time the subject (\"teacher\") wanted to stop the experiment, the experimenter had instructions on what to say to them. These were known as \"verbal prods\". The prods the experimenter had to use were, in this order:\nThere were a few other things the experimenter was allowed to say. For example, if the subject asked about whether the learner would be badly hurt, the experimenter could say \"Although the shocks may be painful, there is no permanent tissue damage, so please go on.\"\nIf the subject still wished to stop after the four main prods had been used, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum \"450-volt\" shock three times in succession.\nResults.\nBefore Milgram did his experiment, he asked fourteen Yale University psychology students what they thought the results would be. On average, the students thought that 1.2% of the \"teachers\" would give the biggest electric shock of 450 volts. In fact, in Milgram's first set of experiments, \"65 percent\" (26 of 40) of participants gave the final massive 450-volt shock, and all gave a shock of at least 300 volts.\nMilgram found that the \"teachers\" showed signs of stress and nervousness in the experiment. Signs of this included sweating, trembling, stuttering and groaning. All of them stopped to question the experiment at some point. Most continued once they were reassured by the experimenter.\nOther psychologists did their own versions of Milgram's experiment and found very similar results.\nVariations.\nAfter repeating the original experiment, Milgram and other scientists tried different variations. These included:\nInterpretations.\nMilgram wrote about the experiment in his book \"Obedience to Authority: an experimental view\". It was published in 1974. Milgram offered two theories:\nOther factors might partly explain the Milgram experiments:\nSome researchers argued that the experiments do not fully answer the question as to why apparently normal people commit atrocities in wartime. For example, the subjects were being told that the shocks would cause no major harm to the learner, whereas those who caused events like the Holocaust knew full well that they were committing murder.\nPop culture.\nThe experiment has been mentioned numerous times in pop culture. In the graphic novel \"V for Vendetta\" Dr. Surridge said that he has lost faith in humanity because of the experiment. In 2013 there was a conference about it at Nipissing University in Canada. The Milgram effect was mentioned in the movie \"\" in passing,"}

He had to clean things, help the knight, for example by running messages for him. He also learned how to fight. When he was 14 he usually became a squire. When he was 21 he sometimes became a knight.\nPages were treated well.

In these openings a player, usually White, sacrifices (gives away) a pawn or more. The usual reason is to develop faster, and get an attack against the black king. Gambits are also used to control the center of the chess board for better development of pieces. The player who plays the Gambit hopes for a development advantage against the opponent. There are a few gambits that require more valuable pieces for a better chance of winning. An example:\nBenko Gambit.\nIn modern times gambits are usually not for direct attacks on the king. They aim at 'positional' advantages, such as freer play for the pieces. A well-known example is the Benko Gambit: \nIn return for his pawn, Black gets open lines for his bishops and his rook on a8."}

{"id": "194143", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194143", "title": "Essjay controversy", "text": "The Essjay controversy is about a well known Wikipedia administrator and salaried Wikia worker, Essjay, who later said he was Ryan Jordan.\nIn February 2007, Essjay was discovered to have made false claims about his school certificates and job experiences on his Wikipedia user page and to news reporter Stacy Schiff during a report for \"The New Yorker\".\nMany people reacted in many ways to the controversy. Many articles and comments were made in electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community checked Essjay's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his activities as an editor, Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.\nWikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjay's use of an identity, saying, \"I regard it as a pseudonym and I don\u2019t really have a problem with it.\" Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia. Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned \"that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes\" on Wikipedia.\n\"The New Yorker\" interview.\nStacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter writing for \"The New Yorker\", interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia. (\"Know It All\"; July 31, 2006) He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation. \"The New Yorker\", said Essjay \"was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page.\"\nDuring the interview, Jordan told \"The New Yorker\" and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law. He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university. It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications. \"The New Yorker\" published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.\nThe article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14\u00a0hours or more a day. The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co-workers and friends. Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking.\nEssjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false persona's credentials, telling for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, \"I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials.\"\nIdentity revealed.\nWhen Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007, he made changes to his Wikia profile and \"came clean on who he really was,\" showing himself as Ryan Jordan. Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials. Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question, saying that:\nHe later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by \"doing a good job playing the part.\"\nSocial activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told \"The New Yorker\" about the difference in profiles. In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change (correction) saying that \"Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught.\"\nOn March 3, 2007, Andrew Lih, Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, said on his blog that a part of Essjay's comments on the incident entered \"the dangerous domain of defamation and libel\" against Stacy Schiff. Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page: \"Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead.\" Lih noted:\nLih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it Schiff said that Essjay's statement was \"complete nonsense.\"\nResponse.\nWikipedia community.\nTalking about Jordan, Wales said, \"Mr. Ryan was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation\".\nEssjay had said in reply at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page, in part saying:\nReaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity difference was pointed. There were many comments. While most editors opposed at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.\nAs the controversy went further, the Wikipedia community began looking at Essjay's previous changes. Some felt he had relied upon his false professorship to prove he was right about his changes. \"People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments,\" said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper, \"The Wikipedia Signpost\". \"Those will get looked at again.\" For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as \"Catholicism for Dummies,\" a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: \"This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own PhD on it\u2019s credibility.\"\nWales was \"...reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes.\" \"I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address,\" Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. \"We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle\", Wales commented. However, he also warned that \"It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate\". Wales argued \"contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them.\" However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential suggestion, saying, \"I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor.\" A formal suggestion that users saying to have qualification would have to give something to prove they really do have them, before using them was rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such suggestions.\nAs a follow-up to his first comments to \"The New Yorker\", Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which showed in its March 19, 2007 issue:\nWales stated his regret that Essjay had \"made a series of very bad judgments.\" He said he hopes the Wkipedia would be better off from the controversy.\nWikipedia critics.\nAndrew Orlowski, a Wikipedia critic and writer for \"The Register\"\u2014a British technology news and opinion website\u2014criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded 'Wikia' and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee. Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia.\nOthers to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe asked \"why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information\" and asked for additional details \"such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements.\"\nLarry Sanger, editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium, and a co-founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002, called Essjay's response \"a defiant non-apology\" and elsewhere stated Essjay's actions as \"identity fraud.\"\nShowing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages, Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management, including Angela Beesley (co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation's Communications Committee) and Brad Patrick (legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation) had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference. Sanger also made note that Jordan's dismissal was the result of public response. That \"Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware, only after there was a response, did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjay\u2019s to quit.\"\nOther comments:\nStudies.\nFollowing the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy, a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" commented \"the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia's credibility\u2014especially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud.\" Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review, saying, \"They could make up your life if they wanted to.\" Brann also said that Wikipedia \"has no place in the University,\" and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia. Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information, though they would not cite it in scholarly work."}

{"id": "194154", "revid": "7679714", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194154", "title": "Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon", "text": "The gameplay of the Pok\u00e9mon series of role-playing video games involves the capture and training of a variety of fictional creatures called \"Pok\u00e9mon\" and using them to battle other trainers. Every generation of games follows this concept by introducing new Pok\u00e9mon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pok\u00e9mon abilities are similar to the Pok\u00e9mon Powers introduced in the \"Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game\".\nBattles.\nBattling is a large part of the games. Pok\u00e9mon can be found in the wild, in dark grass, caves, forests, ponds, the ocean, and even underwater. Also, whenever the player walks where another trainer can see the player, the two must battle. Hundreds of trainers are in each of the main series \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games.\nStatistics.\nPok\u00e9mon have six statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) which all affect how they perform in battles. Statistics can be raised by using items and by training the Pok\u00e9mon.\nBefore \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver\" were released, the \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense\" stats were combined into one statistic, \"Special.\" This later became too complicated so it was divided into \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense.\"\nAbilities.\nStarting in \"Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire\", Pok\u00e9mon have abilities which affect them in various ways. These can be abilities that work while in battle or when the player is just walking around. An example is the ability \"Overgrow\" which increases the power of Grass-type moves when a Pok\u00e9mon's health is below 1/3 of its full amount.\nPok\u00e9mon types.\nEach Pok\u00e9mon has either one or two types. Which types it has affect how it performs when it battles other Pok\u00e9mon of other types. For example, a Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon is weak against Water-type, but is strong against a Grass-type. It could be compared to a more complex game of rock, paper, scissors.\nThis is a list of the types:\nTwo more were added when \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver\" were released:\nAnother type, \"Fairy\", was added in \"Pok\u00e9mon X and Y\".\nPok\u00e9mon Gyms.\nPok\u00e9mon Gyms are buildings where the player faces a Gym Leader, who focuses one of the 18 types of Pok\u00e9mon. There are also trainers in the Gym that the player can battle, and they also use mostly that type. Beating the Gym Leader earns you a Badge which increases your skills.\nEvolution.\nPok\u00e9mon evolve to turn into different Pok\u00e9mon from the same evolutionary line. Doing so, they become stronger and can learn more powerful moves, but learn moves at higher levels.\nEvolution by leveling up.\nThis is the most common way that Pok\u00e9mon evolve. Pok\u00e9mon in this category evolve when they reach a certain level. \nSome Pok\u00e9mon can only evolve by level in a certain place.\nSome Pok\u00e9mon evolve by level if it is holding a certain item.\nSome Pokemon only evolve by level if they are leveled in a route that is having a certain weather. This weather can only work to evolve the Pokemon if the weather is not caused by a move or Ability.\nEvolution by stones.\nThis is another way that Pok\u00e9mon evolve. Some Pok\u00e9mon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones.\nEvolution by trading.\nThis is another way that Pok\u00e9mon evolve. Some Pok\u00e9mon only evolve if they are traded to a friend. \nSome Pok\u00e9mon only evolve if traded to a friend while holding an item.\nSome Pokemon only evolve if they're traded with another, specific Pokemon.\nEvolution by happiness.\nAnother way Pok\u00e9mon evolve is through happiness. Whenever the player character in the game walks 100 steps, gives their Pok\u00e9mon a vitamin such as Protein, Iron, Carbos, Calcium, or Zinc, training it until it gains a level, or when the character does something else to make it happy, it will gain happiness points. The item Soothe Bell multiplies this amount. Once a Pok\u00e9mon has reached a certain happiness level, it will evolve after it is leveled once, sometimes depending on the time of day:\nExample: Eevee evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon if its happiness rating is maxed out; into Espeon if this happens during the day, or Umbreon if it happens during the night. However, such day-and-night distinction exists only in the second-generation games and the generations that follow (but not in \"Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen\").\nEvolution by moves.\nPok\u00e9mon can evolve after learning certain moves and leveling up.\nEvolution by gender.\nSome Pok\u00e9mon can evolve only if they are a certain gender.\nMega Evolution.\nSome Pok\u00e9mon can evolve into a Mega form during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. However, the evolution only lasts for the battle.\nItems.\nA large number of different items exist. They are used to help the player or their Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9 Ball.\nA Pok\u00e9 Ball is a red-and-white sphere that is used to catch Pok\u00e9mon. Many different forms of it exist, such as the Great Ball, the Ultra Ball, the Heavy Ball, the Net Ball, the Dive Ball, the Friend Ball, and the Master Ball (which can catch any Pok\u00e9mon without fail). Each of these have different colors and can be used to catch different Pok\u00e9mon more effectively.\nPok\u00e9dex.\nThe Pok\u00e9dex is a tool used by Pok\u00e9mon trainers all around the Pok\u00e9mon world in different regions. These regions include the Unova region, the Sinnoh region, the Hoenn region, the Johto region and the Kanto region. The Pok\u00e9dex makes records of information about each of the different Pok\u00e9mon. There are 801 different species of Pok\u00e9mon recorded in the world today. Different Pok\u00e9mon are caught in different regions and some Pok\u00e9mon can only be caught in certain regions, such as Xerneas in the Kalos Region.\nRare Pok\u00e9mon.\nLegendary Pok\u00e9mon.\nLegendary Pok\u00e9mon are Pok\u00e9mon that are very rare, and there is usually only one in each game. Examples of legendaries are Articuno, Zapdos, Mewtwo, Lugia, Groudon, and Dialga. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most Pok\u00e9mon. Some roam around, while others can be found in one spot until you KO or capture them. If you KO a legendary, it will usually leave and will never be found again unless the game is restarted or the Elite Four is defeated again. Because of this, players usually save before engaging the Pok\u00e9mon.\nMythical Pok\u00e9mon.\nMythical Pok\u00e9mon are the rarest type of Pok\u00e9mon, only found by one-time events. Examples of Mythical Pok\u00e9mon are Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi.\nShiny Pok\u00e9mon.\nShiny Pok\u00e9mon are a different color than that Pok\u00e9mon normal for their species. Some examples would be a yellow Bulbasaur (they are usually greenish-blue) or a red Gyarados (they are usually blue). They are extremely rare; there is only a 1 in 4,096 chance of an encountered Pok\u00e9mon being shiny, but there are ways to improve your chances of obtaining one, which vary per game. Some Pokemon in the same evolution line have different shiny colors, even if their regular colors are the same. For example, Ponyta and Rapidash normally have reddish-orange flames. However, shiny Ponyta have blue flames while shiny Rapidash have silver flames."}

Hurac\u00e1n", "text": "Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n is a sports club from the Parque Patricios neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The football team currently plays in the Primera A, the first level of the Argentine football league system. Hurac\u00e1n home stadium is the Estadio Tom\u00e1s Adolfo Duc\u00f3.\nHurac\u00e1n was founded on November 1, 1908, in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname (\"Globo\", literally \"Balloon\") come from the \"Hurac\u00e1n\" balloon flied by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Apart from that, club supporters are called \"los Quemeros\" (\"the Burners\") because the stadium is in a former garbage burning area.\nDuring the professional era, Hurac\u00e1n won the Primera Divisi\u00f3n title just once (the 1973 Metropolitano), and obtained 4 titles during the amateur era (in 1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). Moreover, Hurac\u00e1n has finished as runner-up of the first division 5 times during professionalism (the last one in the 2009 Clausura).\nHurac\u00e1n's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro.\nHistory.\nThough officially founded in 1908, there are documents that tell about a previous foundation on May 25, 1903. During the amateur era of Argentine football (1891\u20131930), Hurac\u00e1n won four championships (1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). The team was the fifth most successful during that period.\nDuring the professional era (started in 1931), Hurac\u00e1n had their moment of glory in the \"Metropolitano\" championship of the 1973 season, when they won their only first division title. The team has also won twice the second division (1989\u201390 and 1999\u201300). The club has had 4 promotions and relegations during their history. The last promotion came during the 2006\u201307 season, when Hurac\u00e1n defeated Godoy Cruz in the promotion playoffs.\nHurac\u00e1n was runner-up of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n in the 2009 Clausura. The team, coached by \u00c1ngel Cappa and with Mario Bolatti, Mat\u00edas Defederico and Javier Pastore as key players, was praised for their attacking short-pass style of play. They reached the final game of the season one point above V\u00e9lez Z\u00e1rsfield, but lost 1-0 away with that team in the final fixture (in a game with controversial referral decisions).\nStadium.\nThe Estadio Tom\u00e1s Adolfo Duc\u00f3 was closed in May 2008, after cracks were discovered in one of the structural columns. While the stadium was out of commission, Hurac\u00e1n played their home games at Argentinos Juniors. In August 2008, Fernando \"la tota\" Blauzwirn, an old player from the 1940s correctly said \"no veo la hora de volver al Duc\u00f3, qu\u00e9 sufrimiento muyayo!\" (I cannot wait until returning to the Duco, guys, what a suffering!).\nOn 13 December 2008 during the final weekend of the 2008-09 Apertura championship, Hurac\u00e1n returned to the Duc\u00f3, 438 days after they'd last played there. Their 3-0 victory against V\u00e9lez was the only game Huracan played at home during their centenary year.\nHonours.\nAmateur Era\nOther Amateur Titles\nProfessional Era\nOther professional titles\nSecond Division\nRoller Hockey.\nThe Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n plays in the main Roller Hockey league of Argentina, the Liga Nacional Argentina-Serie A1.\nteam.\nHila"}

Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in 1565. \nExamples.\nSilver coins were widely circulated in Canada (until 1968) and in the United States (until 1964 for dimes (ten cents) and quarters and 1970 for half dollars). However, these countries made their coins cheaper to make by switching to cheaper metals. The silver coins disappeared from circulation as people kept them for the value of their metal. The new coins had value as coins, but less value as metal.\nThe same process happens now with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 Canadian penny (one cent), the pre-1982 United States penny and the pre-1992 UK copper pennies and two pence.\nThis also occurred even with coins made of less expensive metals such as steel in India."}

The phrase is often used between regular partners to say that they wish to have sex, but don't have much time for it. \nA quickie may not always mean sexual intercourse. It may be oral sex or mutual masturbation. According to some, a quickie between a heterosexual couple generally satisfies only the man. Others claim that quickies (with intercourse or some other form of stimulation of the vulva) can be \"a major turn-on\" for a woman, too. Since it may not give a woman enough time to lubricate naturally, she might need a lubricant. Some consider quickies a solution to unequal sexual desire in a relationship. If they become the only form of sex, the relationship may suffer.\nFor gay men, a quickie sometimes means casual sex, like a hand job. It does not usually happen with lesbians, however."}

The penis will enter the throat. The person whose penis is inserted is normally referred as the receiving partner, and the person who performs deep-throating is referred to as the giving partner.\nIt is difficult for most people to perform deep-throating, because of the natural gag reflex that happens when the soft palate is touched. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. \nUsually, the giving partner's tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and they also are not able to suck.\nSex positions.\nThe position of both partners is important in performing deep throat. For deep-throating, the giving partner's mouth and throat will need to be aligned (made into) into a straight line, and he or she will need to respirate through the nose. It is important for the giving partner to be in a position to control any pelvic thrust during deep-throating, to be able to pull the penis out if needed; and for the receiving partner not to thrust, as during irrumatio.\n\"Over-the-edge\" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the giving partner lays on his/her back with the head hanging off the edge of the bed and the receiving partner stands or places himself on his knees in front of the giving partner, with his penis at the giving partner's mouth.\nAnother position used for deep-throating involves the giving partner sitting on the receiving partner's chest, with his feet or penis in front of the giving partner. \nThe 69 position is another position for deep-throating."}

Double fisting pleasure depends more on stretching of the anus or vagina rather than thrusting with an in-and-out movement of the hands.\nFisting can cause lacerations to the vagina, perineum, rectum, and/or colon. This may result in serious injury. These lacerations may even lead to death. Sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot.

In general, sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot, and the risk is probably even higher during pregnancy.\nAnal fisting carries risks of colorectal tearing; people doing it should use latex gloves and lubricant, and have a safeword, which they can say when they want it to stop immediately. The practice, along with the insertion of hard objects into the anus or the vagina has been significantly related to the traumatization of the vaginal or rectal mucosa in increasing the likelihood of infection, including Hepatitis B virus."}

In 2006 there were 5,905 people living in Kyneton. It is on the Calder Highway, but the Calder Freeway now goes around the town to the north and east. Kyneton was named after the English village of Kineton, Warwickshire. Piper Street is the oldest street and still has many of its old buildings.\nThe town is the centre for the local government area, the Shire of Macedon Ranges.\nKyneton is famous for its springs, the Campaspe River, public gardens and old houses, many built from stone. Kyneton has several events during the year including the ANZAC Day parade, the Kyneton Jazz Festival, Kyneton Daffodil Festival, Kyneton Agricultural show and the Kyneton Cup (horse racing). The famous bushranger, Ned Kelly, was put on trial in the Kyneton Courthouse in 1870 for robbery. This courthouse is still in use.\nHistory.\nThe first European to explore the Kyneton area was Major Thomas Mitchell who crossed and named the Campaspe River in 1836. The first settlers came to Kyneton later that year.\nKyneton is different from other towns in the area as it was settled in 1850, a year before the gold rushes started. It was a farming area which became an important stop for those people going to the gold rushes at Mount Alexander and Bendigo. The post office opened on 1 July 1843, as Mount Macedon, but was renamed Kyneton on 1 January 1854.\nMedia.\nKyneton has its own newspaper, the \"Midland Express\", which also serves Castlemaine.\nEducation.\nThere are two primary schools, Kyneton Primary School and Our Lady of the Rosary. There are two secondary schools, Kyneton Secondary College and Sacred Heart College. There is also the Kyneton campus of the Bendigo Regional Institute of TAFE (BRIT), and the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE (NMIT), NMIT Kyneton Park Training Centre at the Kyneton Racecourse.\nSport.\nThe town has a football team which plays in the Bendigo Football League.\nKyneton has a horse racing club, the Kyneton District Racing Club, which holds about 16 race meetings a year. The Kyneton Cup meeting is in November, the day after the Melbourne Cup. In 2009 the Kyneton District Racing Club joined with the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to use the racecourse for educational training.\nThe Kyneton Golf Club is on Black Hill Road.\nKyneton has a soccer team, \"The Rangers\", which plays in the Bendigo Amateur Soccer League \"BASL\""}

{"id": "194396", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194396", "title": "Lucario", "text": "Lucario is a character of the Pok\u00e9mon anime and video game series. Known as the Aura Pok\u00e9mon, it has the ability to feel the Auras of all things. It is a Fighting and Steel Pok\u00e9mon. It is seen in the games \"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl\", and in the movie \"Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\". In an interview with \"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl\" director Junichi Masuda, he noted Lucario's name as one of the hardest to make, because they wanted to make it work for both the Japanese and Americans.\nCharacteristics.\nLucario is a jackal-like Pok\u00e9mon that's around four feet in height. Lucario's hands are black and have one white spike on each arm on the top of its wrists, and there's a third spike on Lucario's chest. Lucario's nose and ears are longer since it evolved from Riolu. Lucario has a furry yellow body, and its hips are in the shape of what looks like blue shorts. It has the ability to sense the aura in all living things, and can use telepathic human speech. By catching the Aura coming from others, it can read their thoughts. A well-trained one can sense auras of creatures over half a mile away.\nAppearances.\nGames.\nLucario is a Pok\u00e9mon that appears in the Nintendo DS versions of \"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl\"; Lucario is used by Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, a tag-team partner known as Riley, and by Cynthia, Sinnoh's Elite Four Champion. In \"Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon\" Lucario is seen as the greatest rescue leader of all time, and earning 15,000 Rescue Points will put the player in the top rank - the Lucario rank - and the Lucario statue will be put outside the rescue base.\nIt is a fighter in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and uses attacks like Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, Double Team, and its final smash, Aura Storm. Lucario was confirmed to be a playable character in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" due to a leak. After seeing their mistake they quickly fixed it. Lucario and Jigglypuff can no longer be seen but there are many YouTube videos which show proof of the leak, as well as screen shots. \nIn Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, the player receives a free Lucario from Korrina. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Lucario using the Lucarionite.\nAnime.\nLucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pok\u00e9mon movie, \"Pok\u00e9mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\". In the movie, Lucario is a servant to Sir Aaron in a Renaissance-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to use aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's start, Lucario begins questioning any Pok\u00e9mon-human relationship. The Lucario in the movie, can also speak human languages without psychic powers. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar.\nMaylene in the anime, like in the games, has a Lucario and it was seen in four episodes. It was first seen battling with Maylene in their training. Lucario used Aura Sphere to stop the battle of Electabuzz, Piplup, and Pikachu, and is seen battling Paul's Pok\u00e9mon in a flashback. Lucario was seen again where it battled in Dawn's gym battle with Maylene, where it defeated Dawn's Ambipom and Piplup. Then, in the next episode, it battled in Ash's gym battle against Maylene. It defeated Ash's Staravia and Chimchar, but was knocked out along with Ash's Buizel, which ended in a tie. Finaly, Lucario was seen when it helped Ash and the others defeat Saturn and Team Galactic.\nManga.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, like in games, it appears under the ownership of Riley who was on a boat heading to the Battle Frontier. Diamond meets Riley at Iron Island, and Byron asks Riley to help Diamond sharpen his Pok\u00e9mon battle skills before Diamond goes to Lake Verity. In \"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!\" the main character, Hareta, gained a Riolu egg which hatched into a Riolu later on in that chapter and then evolved in to Lucario.\nReception.\nUGO described Lucario as \"a new breed of Pok\u00e9mon, with a cooler, more dangerous look. It's quick and possesses a damaging set of attacks\", yet called it lame due to its status as a Pok\u00e9mon. IGN called its presence in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" \"a bit on the head scratching side\" in light of more familiar characters in the title such as Pikachu. Although another editor stated that it would make sense for \"Pok\u00e9mon\" to be represented by a fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon, since \"Super Smash Bros Brawl\" is a fighting game. GamesRadar described it as an \"all-around bad-ass\" and \"the Bruce Lee of Pok\u00e9mon\", suggesting its design as similar to the Egyptian God Anubis. Beckett \"Pok\u00e9mon\" Unofficial Collector editor Sean Cooper stated that Lucario had grown popular in recent years due to his starring role in \"Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\" and his appearance in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\"."}

It shows the relation between stars' luminosity (that is, how bright they are) and their temperature (how hot they are). These diagrams are not pictures or maps of the locations of the stars. Rather, Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams plot each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness versus its temperature. Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are also called H-R diagrams or HRDs.\nYou can see an example of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to the right. This diagram is based on measurements from 23,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is named after its creators, astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.\nDrawing a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nThe vertical axis of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars, as if they were all measured from the same distance. Another term for this is absolute magnitude. The brighter a star is, the higher its plot will be on this chart.\nThe horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars. However, the temperatures go \"down\", not up, as you move to the right. That is, the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots (greater than 30,000 Kelvins) while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000K.\nIn general, the temperature of a star relates to its color. At the top of the chart, along with the temperatures, are the Spectral Classes. The hottest stars are blue-white (class O), those in the middle temperatures are yellow (class G) and the coolest ones are red (class M). (Of course, when we say \"coolest\" about stars, we must realize that the lowest temperature for a star is almost 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.)\nAs a matter of fact, when Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams were developed in the early 1900's, astronomers did not know how to find out the temperature of a star. The first diagrams plotted stars' absolute magnitude (where \"adding\" one meant the brightness would go \"down\" by about two and a half times) against color, represented by the spectral classes from blue-white to red. \nRegions with many stars.\nAs you can see, stars tend to fall only into certain regions of the diagram when graphed in this way. All stars in a given area of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram share similar luminosities and temperatures. The main region where stars appear is the diagonal curved line, going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). This is called the Main Sequence. Above the main sequence is another region containing the red giants. Below is a curved line representing the white dwarfs.\nThese collections of stars by brightness and temperature are important when talking about stellar evolution. In general, stars are created in the main sequence. (Of course, when we say \"\"in\" the main sequence\" we really mean \"having a brightness and a temperature that causes them to be plotted within the main sequence on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\") After billions of years, they expand into red giants. Then, after another one or two billion years, they shrink into white dwarfs.\nIt was only in the 1930's and 1940's that scientists began to understand the role of nuclear fusion in creating and keeping stars like our sun. These days Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are used to present stellar evolution in pictures to students. They're not used much any more for developing new scientific theories.\nOn a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, our Sun is plotted very close to the middle of the main sequence at the intersection of luminosity 1 and temperature 5780K. Therefore, the sun is class G or a \"yellow star\")."}

Many seabirds live \"at sea\", that is, far away from land. They may only come on land to breed. Other seabirds live in colonies on islands. Very often, seabirds use the sea for food, most often fish or shellfish. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families first appeared in the Palaeogene. The similarities between them are examples of convergent evolution. The same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. \nSeabirds share a number of adaptations to sea life. They live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds. They do spend a great deal of time with their young. Most species nest in colonies. These vary from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species take long annual migrations every year, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds vary in how much of the year they spend at sea."}

It was also the third tropical cyclone since 2007 to form before June 1. The storm formed on May 28, and moved across the Atlantic Ocean. Later that day, the storm started to weaken and fall apart. On May 29, the storm died and became a remnant low.\nBefore the storm became a depression, some parts of the storm brought light rainfall to the eastern tip of North Carolina. However there were no damages or deaths reported. Also the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not give out any tropical storm watches or warnings for the storm.\nStorm history.\nDuring mid-May, a disorganized low pressure area formed in the Atlantic Ocean about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. The low pressure moved north and started to become more organized. On May 27, the storm was 120 miles (195\u00a0km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) decided to start monitoring the storm. A high pressure area that was located southeast of the storm pushed it into a northeast direction. Then on 8 pm EDT (0000 UTC on May 28), the NHC stopped monitoring the storm, as the low was not expected to strengthen anymore.\nOn May 28, the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC), they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One. At that time, the storm's location was about 310\u00a0mi (500\u00a0km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. After it was named as a depression, the storm showed deep convection and the center of circulation was at the northwestern part of the storm. The reason why the depression restrengthened was because of lower wind shear and warmer ocean waters from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, the depression started to weaken when it moved into an area with higher wind shear and colder ocean waters. Around 7:30 pm EDT (2330 UTC), a QuikSCAT satellite flew over the depression and found tropical storm-force winds. But the NHC thought the depression didn't strengthen and that winds were affected by rain. After the satellite passed over the depression, the center of circulation moved closer to the northwest edge of the storm and convection started to decrease.\nOn May 29, the depression almost became a tropical storm, when the storm's strength was measured at T2.5, or 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h) using the Dvorak technique. But some of the measurements were also low as T1.5, which was the reason why the NHC didn't call it a tropical storm. After a quick burst of convection during the night, thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 3:00 am EDT (0700 UTC). By then, the tropical depression was no longer expected to strength anymore and was forecasted to weaken. A few hours later, the center of circulation was ripped apart by strong wind shear while a nearby trough also started to absorb the rest of the storm. With no convection around the center of the storm, it became a remnant low during the afternoon. At 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC), the NHC gave out its last advisory on Tropical Depression One. The remains of the storm were later taken in by a warm front around 2 am EDT (0600 UTC).\nImpact and records.\nOn May 27 the cyclone brought some light rainfall to parts of coastal North Carolina before it was called Tropical Depression One. Hatteras, North Carolina saw 0.1 in (2.5\u00a0mm) of rainfall and wind speeds up to 15\u00a0mph (24\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 23\u00a0mph (37\u00a0km/h). The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded from the storm was 1009 mbar (hPa; 29.81 inHg).\nWhen the storm became Tropical Depression One on May 28, it was the third time since 1851 that an Atlantic tropical cyclone formed before June 1, the official start of an Atlantic hurricane season. The depression followed Subtropical Storm Andrea of May 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur of May 2008. The first time this event happened was in 1932, 1933, and 1934; the second time it happened was in 1951, 1952, and 1953. The National Hurricane Center also reported that Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone has ever formed."}

Old world monkeys, who show fear of snakes and have an advanced visual system, evolved in Africa under continual pressure from snakes. Some mammals evolved physiological resistance to snake venoms, but African apes improved their ability to see snakes visually before the snakes could strike."}

It was started in 2007 by three girls, Melissa Marie Green, Allison Green, and Dani Artaud. They are very popular on MySpace. The girls are notable for their mostly negative reaction from other people. They also performed one show for the TV show Double Shot at Love with the Ikki Twins.\nHistory.\nMillionaires started in August 2007, when Melissa Marie and Allison made a song on their new laptop with GarageBand. They named the song \"I Like Money\", and decided they needed a name for themselves to make a MySpace profile for the song. Melissa Marie and Allison decided on Millionaires, to go with the name of the song. Soon after, Dani came in the mix, and they made their second song, \"Hoe Down.\"\nAfter a few months, they began to perform shows locally and traveled only small distances for shows. They got spots in music festivals such as Rockin Roots,Bamboozle Left 2008,and Audio Overload 2008. By July 2008, they were ready to tour and they went out on their first tour co-headlining with another band, Breathe Carolina across the West coast. Later in July, they headlined the GET F$CKED UP tour.\nIn July 2008, they performed on MTV's TRL as part of On The Radar, a show where popular bands not signed to a record label perform. The girls returned in January and February 2009 on their Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid tour, which sold out every date. They made a short song titled \"Ooh Uh Huh\", which became the theme song for MTV's reality show \"A Double Shot At Love\" with the Ikki twins. Their song \"Hey Rich Boy\" was also used as the theme for MTV's Teen Cribs.\nDecaydance controversey.\nBefore Millionaires were to release their second EP, \"Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid\", it was rumored that the Millionaires were signed to Decaydance after Gabe Saprota from Cobra Starship convinved Pete Wentz to sign them on to the label. Later Wentz sent a message saying that Millionaires were not signed to Decaydance, and that Crush management had asked them to produce hard copies of their EP."}

The normal magazine size (how many bullets it holds at once) is 30 or 15 rounds.\nThere are many other versions of the gun, some which use different caliber bullets, are shorter, or have other differences. One important type of MP5 is the MP5SD series, which are MP5s with built in suppressors ('silencers'). The MP5SDs are quieter than most guns and can be used for stealth. The MP5 is used by many special forces groups around the world, including the United States Navy Seals and British SAS.\nSince it is used by many heroes in pop culture, it is sometimes called the \"good guy gun.\"\nMP7.\nThe MP7 is the updated MP5. It was designed with a new cartridge with higher muzzle velocity to meet NATO requirements published in 1989. A modern PDW needs greater ability to defeat body armour, because former weapons used only conventional pistol cartridges. The MP7 went into production in 2001. It is a direct rival to the Belgian FN P90, also developed in response to NATO's requirement. The MP7 has been revised since its introduction and the current production version is the MP7A1."}

Some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow. Others may be animated like a cartoon. Sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine. \nMany new games use prerendered scenes, meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file. Prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine, but some use Computer-generated imagery (CGI), which is separately made 3D graphics which are usually fancier than the game's normal graphics. Prerendered scenes with CGI are often used for a game's intro video.\nA few games use live-action video footage, which is filmed like a movie or television show.

However, many groups sought to end slavery in the United States. The groups became the Republican Party in 1856, and gained power in 1860 with the election of Abraham Lincoln.\nIn 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves only in certain parts of the United States, and did not actually make slavery illegal.\nNear the end of the Civil War, Republicans, who controlled Congress, introduced an amendment to make slavery illegal (against the law) in every part of the United States. (In order for an amendment to happen, it first must be passed by both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, and then passed by three-quarters of the states' legislatures.)

She is remembered today for her strange relationship with the famous composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. For many years she paid him a lot of money each month so that he could compose. They wrote passionate love letters to one another, yet they never actually met one another.\nShe also gave financial support to other people in the arts and music, especially to the composers Nikolai Rubinstein and Claude Debussy.\nLife.\nChildhood.\nShe was born Nadezhda Filaretovna Frolovskaya. Her family owned a lot of land. Her father loved music. Her mother was a very determined business woman.\nNadezhda learned to play the piano and she read many books, learned foreign languages and learned about paintings.\nMarriage.\nWhen she was 16 it was arranged for her to marry Karl von Meck, a 28-year-old engineer. Together they had 18 children, of whom 11 grew up to be adults.\nHer husband worked for the government. He did not earn much money and the family was growing quickly. Nadezhda wanted her husband to be rich. At this time the steam engine had recently been invented, and railways were just starting to be built in Russia. Nadezhda thought her husband could earn a lot of money building railways. She was right. As an engineer he became responsible for buildings thousands of miles of railroad tracks. The new railways allowed grain to be transported from Central Russia to places like Moscow.\nHe soon became a multi-millionaire.\nKarl died suddenly in 1873. Nadezhda took over his business matters. She sold one railway and controlled the other one with the help of her brother. She kept away from other people, living a solitary life with her children. She was very strict indeed with them, telling them exactly what to do all the time. She did not like the idea of marriage, but realized her children would need to marry. She tried to get them to marry quickly, probably for financial reasons. \nSupport for arts and music.\nNadezhda von Meck was very rich and loved music, so she became an important person in Russian performing arts. Several musicians were employed by her in her house. Claude Debussy lived with the family for a time as a music teacher to her daughters. Debussy was a young man at the time, and not yet famous. \nThe only concerts she went to were those given by the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. She sat alone where nobody would notice her. She met Nikolai Rubinstein. She thought he had great talent, but she disagreed with him a lot of the time. \nRelationship with Tchaikovsky.\nIn 1877 she came into contact with Tchaikovsky, although she never met him. She asked him to compose some pieces for violin and piano to play at her home. Tchaikovsky knew she was a rich lady who paid well, so he quickly composed some music. They wrote letters to one another, exchanged photographs of one another, but they came to an agreement that they would never meet. She paid him 6,000 rubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.\nIn 1876 Tchaikovsky had decided to marry. He was then a composer aged 36. He was gay, and this was something terrible in Russia at that time. He was very frightened that people would find out and that he would be bullied. So he decided to marry. He did not care who it was he married, so long as it would make him look respectable. The next year he found a young girl called Antonina to marry. He told Nadezhda. She wrote to congratulate him and told him she hoped he would be happy. A week later, Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda to ask for more money because the marriage had put him into debt. A few weeks later he was writing again to her saying that he hated his wife. He soon separated from her. Writing to Nadezhda was a great support to him at this time. It is impossible to know whether Nadezhda knew he was gay or whether that would have made a difference to her feelings. At any rate, she continued to write that she loved him. She increased the amount she was paying him to 6,000 roubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.\nHer relationship with Tchaikovsky was also a good thing for her. She hated anything to do with sex, so it was good that she could express her emotions to someone whom she did not have to face in person. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Fourth Symphony to her.\nOn one occasion they met one another by accident. Nadezhda had invited Tchaikovsky to stay at her home. This was a huge house in enormous grounds, so it was easy to arrange that they should not meet. They agreed that they would not go out at the same time. However, one day he came home late and she went out early. She was in a horse carriage and he was walking. When they saw one another they looked away quickly.\nIn October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's money in advance, saying that it was the last time she would be able to send him money. She said she was bankrupt. She may have worried that she probably would be bankrupt in a year\u2019s time.\nSome people think that she did this because she found out about Tchaikovsky\u2019s homosexuality. Others disagree with this. After all, in her last letter to him she asked him never to forget her.\nDeath.\nNadezhda von Meck died from tuberculosis on 13 January 1894 in Nice, France, two months after Tchaikovsky had died."}

{"id": "195252", "revid": "212856", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195252", "title": "Sovereign state", "text": "A sovereign state is a state with borders where people live, and where a government makes laws and talks to other sovereign states. The people have to follow the laws that the government makes. Most sovereign states are \"recognized\" which means other sovereign states agree that it is really a sovereign state. Being recognized makes it easier for a sovereign state to talk to and make agreements (treaties) with other sovereign states. There are hundreds of recognized sovereign states today - see List of sovereign states.\nDefinition.\nThere is no rule to say what exactly makes a state. Usually, the things a state must have are mainly political, not legal. The Czechs and the Poles were seen as separate states during World War I, even though they did not exist as states yet. L.C. Green explained this by saying that \"recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion, it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes, regardless of the existence of territory or an established government.\"\nThis means that it is up to any state that already exists to treat any other group as a state. This recognition can be direct or implied. When a state does this, it usually means that the group will also be treated as a state for things that happened in the past. Sometimes it means that the state wants diplomatic relations with the other group, but not always.\nSovereignty is a word that is often used wrongly. Lassa Oppenheim said that there is no idea whose meaning is more than sovereignty. No one argues the fact that from the time the idea of sovereignty was first used in political science until now, there has never been one meaning that everyone agreed on. Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia says that \"sovereignty is neither a question of fact, nor a question of law, but a question that does not arise at all.\" \nAlthough the word sovereignty often includes all types of government, ancient and modern, the modern state has some links to the type of government first seen in the 15th century, when the term \"state\" also first meant what it does today. Because of this, the word is often used to refer only to modern political systems.\nWe often use the words \"country\", \"nation\", and \"state\" as if they mean the same thing; but there is actually a difference:\nBecause the meaning of the words has changed over time and past writers often used the word \"state\" in a different ways it is difficult to say exactly what a state is. Mikhail Bakunin used the word simply to mean a governing organization. Other writers used the word \"state\" to mean any law-making or law enforcement agency. Karl Marx said that the state was what was used by the ruling class of a country to control the rule. According to Max Weber, the state is an organization who are the only people allowed to use violence in a particular area.\nConstitutive theory of statehood.\nIn 1815 at the Congress of Vienna the Final Act only recognized 39 sovereign states in Europe. Because of this, they said that in future new states would have to be recognized by other states. In practice, this meant recognition by one or more of the most powerful countries.\nThis constitutive theory was developed in the 19th century to describe what is and is not a state. With this theory, the need to follow international law depends on whether other sovereign governments recognize the group. Because of this, new states could not become part of the international community or be bound by international law immediately, so recognized nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them.\nIn 1912, an expert had the following to say on constitutive theory:\n\"International Law does not say that a State is not in existence as long as it isn't recognised, but it takes no notice of it before its recognition. Through recognition only and exclusively a State becomes an International Person and a subject of International Law\".\nOne of the major issues is the confusion that happens when some states recognize a new group, but other states do not. Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the main people who supported the theory, suggested that it is a state's job to grant recognition as a possible solution. However, a state may use any set of rules when judging if they should give recognition.\nDeclarative theory of statehood.\nOne of the criteria most commonly used by micronations is the Montevideo Convention. The Montevideo Convention was signed on December 26 1933 by the United States, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Cuba but it never received international consensus. The Montevideo Convention has four conditions that a group \"should\" meet to become a state:\nAccording to this, the existence of a state does not depend upon recognition by other states. Whether or not an group meets the conditions is decided by other states when they decide if they are going to treat that group as a state. Usually, new states are formally recognized by at least a few other states.\n\"De facto\" and \"de jure\" states.\nMost sovereign states are states \"de jure\" and \"de facto\". This means they exist both in law and in real life. However, sometimes states are only \"de jure\" states. This means that other states see a group as the true government of a place where they have no actual control. Many European states had governments-in-exile during the Second World War which still had relations with the Allies, even though their countries were under Nazi occupation. An example today is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which is a United Nations observer, has with 104 states. It has no land of its own, only embassies and consulates. Other states may have sovereignty over a place, but are not recognized by other states, these are \"de facto\" states only. Many people agree that Somaliland is such a state."}

Yad Vashem says that the Nazis used rumors about making soap from bodies to scare the camp inmates. However, there is evidence that research facilities had come up with a way for large amounts of soap to be made from human bodies.\nHistory.\nWorld War I.\nDuring World War I, the British had already accused Germany of using the fat from human bodies to make things. In April 1917, an important newspaper in London, England called \"The Times\" wrote that the Germans were using the bodies of their own dead soldiers to make soap and other products. It was not until 1925 that the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain, officially said that the \"corpse factory\" story had been an error.\nWorld War II.\nStories that the Nazis made soap from the bodies of concentration camp victims were common during the war. Germany did not have enough fats to make soap during World War II. Because of this, the government took control of making soap.\nThe \"human soap\" stories may have started because with the bars of soap made by the government were marked with the initials \"RIF.\" Some people thought this stood for \"Reichs-Juden-Fett\" in German. This means \"State Jewish Fat\" in English. (In German acronyms, \"I\" and \"J\" were often used like the same letter, so people thought \"RIF\" could mean \"RJF\".)\nIn fact, \"RIF\" actually stood for \"Reichsstelle f\u00fcr Industrielle Fettversorgung.\" This was the German government agency in charge of making and giving out soap and washing products during the war. (In English, the agency's name was the \"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning.\") RIF soap was not very good, and did not have any kind of fat.\nRaul Hilberg reports that stories about soap made from human fat were told in Lublin, Poland, as early as October 1942. The Germans themselves knew about the stories. Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, got letter saying the Poles thought Jewish people were being \"boiled into soap.\" The letter also said the Poles feared they would also be used to make soap. These stories were so widely known that some Polish people actually refused to buy soap. Himmler was so worried by the rumors, and the thought of poor security at the camps, that he said that all bodies should be burnt or buried as quickly as possible.\nSoviet propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg reported a common version of the story as fact in \"The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry\":\nEvidence of soap-making at Stutthof.\nDuring the Nuremberg Trials, Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory worker at the Danzig Anatomical Institute, said that soap had been made from the bodies of dead people at Stutthof concentration camp. He said that 70 to 80\u00a0kg of fat collected from 40 bodies could make more than 25\u00a0kg of soap. He also said that the finished soap was kept by Professor Rudolf Spanner.\nMazur gave a recipe that read: \"5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds.\" \nAt the Nuremberg Trials, Nazi witnesses and British prisoners of war supported Mazur's story. (The British prisoners of war had been used as forced labor to build the Stutthof camp.) These witnesses talked about seeing:\nAfter doing research, Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt found little evidence of mass production of soap from human fat. However, he found evidence that soap had been made from human fat in experiments. Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector agrees that the Nazis \"did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof,\" but in small amounts.\nIn his book \"Russia at War 1941 to 1945\", Alexander Werth said that while visiting Danzig in 1945 just after it was freed by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human bodies. Werth said that it had been run by \"a German professor called Spanner\" and \"was a\nnightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsoes pickled in some liquid,\nand its pails full of a flakey substance - human soap\".\nPostwar.\nAfter the war, in 1955, Alain Resnais included the idea that the Nazis made large amounts of \"human soap\" in his Holocaust documentary movie \"Nuit et brouillard\". After the war, some Israelis also spoke about Jewish victims of Nazism with the Hebrew word \"\u05e1\u05d1\u05d5\u05df\" (\"sabon\", \"soap\").\nMainstream Holocaust scholars think the idea that Nazis made large amounts of \"human soap\" is part of WWII folklore. Examples of scholars who believe this include the well-known Jewish historians Walter Laqueur, Gitta Sereny, and Deborah Lipstadt. Other people who believe this include Professor Yehuda Bauer of Israel's Hebrew University, and Shmuel Krakowski, archives director of Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center. Historian Yisrael Gutman agrees that \"it was never done on a mass scale.\" And Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis \"did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof,\" but in small amounts.\nToday Holocaust deniers use this story to make people doubt the Nazi genocide.\nPlay.\n\"The Soap Myth\" is a 2009 play about Nazis making soap from the bodies of the people they murdered."}

The movie follows a computer hacker named David Lightman (Broderick) who breaks into a NORAD war games simulation computer that he thinks is really the computer for a computer game company. Lightman begins a series of events that could start World War III. The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a big hit. It continues to be popular.\nPlot.\nThe movie begins with two air force officers in a nuclear missile silo who are ordered to fire the missiles in the silo. The officers believe the order to be real and begin to fire the missiles. One of the officers decides not to fire and so the US government replaces all the men in the missile silos with computer control.\nDavid Lightman (Broderick) is a smart high school student and computer hacker that at first limits himself to changing his and a girl whom he likes a lot, Jennifer's (Sheedy) grades from failing to passing grades: Lightman being smart but not motivated at school. A little while later David uses his IMSAI 8080 computer to dial many phone numbers and finds a backdoor into a NORAD war games simulation computer called WOPR (nicknamed the \"Whopper\"). At first David is looking for new computer games to download and play and believes that the WOPR is actually the computer of a company that makes new computer games. After finding a list of games on the computer decides to play a game. WOPR (who is an Artificial Intelligence computer) asks David for a password and after doing some research on the computer's creator Professor Steven Falken he guesses that the password is named after the creator's dead son, Joshua. After logging in using the correct password, W.O.P.R. believes David to actually be Dr. Falken whom the computer had believed to be dead. The computer (which David now calls \"Joshua\") asks him if he would like to play a game. David selects the game \"Global Thermonuclear War\". Doing so starts off a series of events that will end up taking the World into World War III unless it is stopped.\nThe television news later reports that the USA went on high-alert due to a computer error leading David and Jennifer to wonder if they had caused the problem. David throws away the evidence of his calling Joshua but the computer calls David back. David then asks Joshua if the game it is playing is real or not, Joshua relies \"what is the difference?\" At this point David learns that Joshua is not a computer game companies' computer but a government one and is actually is playing the game for real. He hangs up but Joshua calls him back, leading David to remove the cord from the back of his telephone. David is then arrested by the FBI and taken to NORAD to answer charges of espionage. David tries to explain that he was not trying to be a spy, but he is not believed. Using things found in the medical office in which he is locked, David escapes from NORAD on a bus load of visitors to the facility. After David escapes he telephones Jennifer (using Phreaking skills) to ask her to buy him an airplane ticket so he can go and see Falken and get his help in stopping Joshua. Jennifer meets him and together then both go off to convince Falken to help them stop World War III.\nProfessor Falken has in fact resigned from NORAD because he believes war will happen no matter what any one does. Jennifer and David try to convince him to help them explain to NORAD that this is just a game that Joshua is playing. Falken tells them that it is not worth it as it may only buy them a few years but war will still happen. He explains that they are lucky because he lives only a few miles from a primary target and that they will die in a instant. David and Jennifer decide to try to stop the game anyway and try to leave the island. Finding no way off the island since the last ferry has left, Jennifer says that they should \"swim for it\". David admits he cannot swim. Professor Falken shows up with a helicopter and together they all go to NORAD.\nInside NORAD Falken tells them it is all a game and they decide to allow the missiles that the Soviet Union has reportedly fired to land to see if it is real or a game. The computer screens show the missiles landing but no missiles actually land. This convinces NORAD that the whole thing was not real. Joshua, however, decides to crack the launch codes and fire the USA's missiles for real. David and Falken try to get Joshua to stop the firing and eventually succeed when Jennifer mentions the word \"games\". After many tries they get Joshua to play tic-tac-toe against itself in an effort to teach it the meaning of (a word meaning that there is no point to doing something, or that doing so will not help). Joshua tries every game of tic-tac-toe possible and then tries the same thing with every scenario within the Global Thermonuclear War game. Joshua then learns that war can not be won, and stops the game ending the threat of World War III.\nReception.\nThe movie was a hit. It was nominated for three Academy Awards. The movie had a production budget of $12 million and had gross revenues of over $120 million making it a high earning movie.\nCult status.\n\"WarGames\" has a cult following amongst computer users and fans of the 1980s. The movie led to the development of the term war dialing (the calling of phone numbers looking for computers to connect to and hack)."}

It was compatible with its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800, by which it was inspired. The IMSAI is largely thought of as the first \"clone\" computer. The IMSAI machine used a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was designed, made and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed \"IMSAI Manufacturing Corp\"). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978.\nHistory.\nIn May 1972, William Millard began business as \"IMS Associates\" (IMS) in the area of computer consultancy and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard began IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found capital for his business, and received several contracts, all for software.\nIn 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a \"workstation system\" that could do jobs for any General Motors new-car dealership. IMS planned a system including a terminal, small computer, printer, and special software. Five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had announced the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had first used, the 8080 looked like a better idea. Full scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was begun, and by October 1975 an advertisement was placed in the magazine \"Popular Electronics\", receiving positive reactions.\nIMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on December 16 1975. In 1976, IMS was renamed to \"IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation\" because by then they were a manufacturing company, not a consultancy one. By October 1979 the IMSAI corporation had gone bankrupt, and the 'IMSAI' trademark was acquired by Thomas \"Todd\" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees of IMS Associates), who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer-Freitas Co. Support for early IMSAI systems continues to this day.\nUses.\nThe IMSAI 8080 was used for\nIMSAI in popular culture.\nAn IMSAI 8080 and an acoustic coupler type modem were among the hacking tools used by the main character in the 1983 movie \"WarGames\". However, even by 1983 the acoustic coupler was out of date. It was selected over a more modern model so that the audience would immediately recognize it as the device that connected to the telephone."}

He went to see his relatives in the Mississippi Delta area when he spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant. She was the married owner of a small grocery store. Several nights later, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam, went to Till's great-uncle's house. They took Till to a barn. It is believed that they beat him and removed one of his eyes . They then shot him in the head and put his body in the Tallahatchie River. His body was found in the river three days later.\nTill's body was returned to Chicago. His mother wanted on a public funeral service with an open casket. She wanted this to show the world how her son had been killed. Tens of thousands of people went to his funeral or saw his casket. Images of his body were published in black magazines and newspapers. This caused support from both black and white people in the United States. At first, local newspapers and law enforcement officials spoke against the violence and asked for justice. They soon began dealing with national criticism by defending the people of Mississippi. This led to support for the people said to be the killers.\nTrial.\nThe trial of those accused of killing Till had a large amount of press attention. Bryant and Milam were acquitted of Till's murder. They were not charged with his kidnapping. Months later, when they could not be tried again because of double jeopardy, they said they killed him in a magazine interview. Till's murder is considered an important event leading to the Civil Rights Movement. \nProblems proving that the body was Till affected the trial. This was a part of the reason for Bryant's and Milam's acquittals. The case was reopened by the United States Department of Justice in 2004. An autopsy of the body was done. It was proven to be Till's body. He was reburied in a new casket. His old casket was given to the Smithsonian Institution."}

It is published by United Nations Development Programme. It is used to rank countries into different groups for example developed and developing countries.\nThe Human Development Index uses different measurements of a population:\nCriticism.\nThe Human Development Index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called \"Western models of development\", failure to include any ecological considerations, lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization, focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking, lack of attention to development from a global perspective, measurement error of the underlying statistics, and on the UNDP's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of 'low', 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' human development countries.\nEconomists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer think that very often, the data which is used to construct the statictics for the HDI is wrong.. According to them, there are three sources of error in the data:\nThey found that 11 %, 21% and 34% of countries are currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error. The authors suggest that the United Nations should stopthe practice of classifying countries into development bins because the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large. In 2010 the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to \"The Economist\" in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded to a January 6, 2011 article in the magazine which discusses the Wolff \"et al.\" paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff \"et al.\" in that it generates a system for continuous updating of the human development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\nThe HDI uses a weighted average for the different values. This means that it can be used - to some extent - to compare countries. It cannot be used to show the problems inside a country. Also the index only takes into accounrt people of 20 years or older. This leaves out problems such as infant mortality and children who do not reach that age. \nEconomist Bryan Kaplan points out another problem: Things needed in everyday life are underrepresented, education is overrepresented. Unless the whole population is made of students and pupils, it is not possible to reach the maximum score for the education parameter. At the moment, a Scandinavian country is at the top of the list. This means that the HDI measures \"how Scandiavian\" a country is. It would also mean that the country at the top of the list has no potential for improvement, which is certainly not the case.\n2011 data.\nThe 2011 Human Development Report was released on 2 November 2011.

Other teams named \"Whitecaps\" have played Association footballin Vancouver since 1974 in the old North American Soccer League, the Canadian Soccer League, and the USL.\nHistory.\nThe original Vancouver Whitecaps were founded on December 11, 1973. During the 1970s and 1980s, they played in the North American Soccer League (NASL), a soccer league that no longer exists. The Whitecaps achieved success, winning the 1979 Soccer Bowl.\nIt was during this short time that soccer became popular in Vancouver. The Whitecaps crowds at Empire Stadium grew to sell out crowds, at 32,000 fans per match.\nAfter playing at Vancouver's 32,000-seat Empire Stadium for most of their early years, the team moved into the new 60,000-seat BC Place Stadium in 1983. However, the end of the NASL in 1984 meant the Whitecaps could not longer play in the NASL.\nWhitecaps did not play in 1985, but they joined the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) the next year and changed their name to the 86ers. They joined the United Soccer Leagues in 1990, and renamed themselves back to the Whitecaps and then to \"Vancouver Whitecaps FC\". For the next twenty years, they played in the second level of soccer in Canada, finally ending in 2010.\nNow they play in Major League Soccer, which they started playing in during 2011. On October 21, 2012, the Whitecaps became the first Canadian team to make it into the MLS Cup Playoffs. The team was eliminated in the knockout round by the LA Galaxy.\nReferences.\nNotes"}

It is also called sometimes \"Compostela de Azua\".\n\"Azua\" is the Ta\u00edno name of the region where the old city was founded. In this place, Pedro Gallego (or Pedro Mariscal), a Spanish colonist, developed a farm and he gave it the name of \"Compostela\" after Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, nortwestern Spain.\nPopulation.\nThe municipality had, in 2010, a total population of 91,345: 46,280 men and 45,065 women. The urban population was of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality. The population of the city of Azua de Compostela without those municipal districts was 59,319.\nHistory.\nThe town was founded in 1504 by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, who later went to conquest the island of Cuba; the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola island at that time was Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando. The town was in the original region of Azua, where there was a Ta\u00edno town and Pedro Gallego had a farm. This place is called now \"Pueblo Viejo\" (in English, \"Old Town\"), at about 8\u00a0km to the soutwest of the modern city.\nThe first secretary of the town was Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. He lived in Azua from 1504 to 1511, when he left to Cuba and, later, to conquest M\u00e9xico.\nSeveral sugar factories were established around the town and pirates came here to get the sugar and other products.\nIn 1751 there was a strong earthquake that destroyed the old town and a new one was founded on the right (western) side of the River V\u00eda, where the modern city is now.\nBecause Azua is on the road that goes from the western part of the island to Santo Domingo, the city was destroyed several times during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856). Two important battles (the \"Azua Battles\") were fought in the city; the first was on 19 March 1844 and the second on 1849.\nGeography.\nThe municipality of Azua de Compostela is in a very dry valley (the \"Azua Valley\" or \"Azua Plain\") where cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Farming is possible only with irrigation.\nThe territory around the city is very flat, with only a few very small hills but there are mountains in the north and northwest of the municipality; those mountains are part of the \"Cordillera Central\" mountain range. The only river in the municipality is the \"V\u00eda\", a very small river that flows through the city.\nAzua de Compostela is at to the west of Santo Domingo. The limits of the municipality are Peralta to the north, Esteban\u00eda to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south, Pueblo Viejo to the southwest and Sabana Yegua to the west.\nClimate.\nAzua de Compostela has a subtropical steppe/semi-arid hot climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification : BSh).\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is .

It was also the first tropical cyclone to affect the Caribbean during 2009. The storm formed on August 11, but strong wind shear weakened it on August 13. Ana later reformed and became a tropical storm on August 15 before wind shear tore apart the storm again. The storm finally died on August 17.\nBetween August 15 and 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave out tropical storm watches to some Caribbean islands like the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Some people took a few precautions. Most of the damage from Ana was in the form of rain.\nStorm history.\nA tropical wave formed over the Cape Verde islands on August 9. The NHC started watching the storm to see if it would turn into a tropical cyclone. It became a tropical depression on August 11. By then, the storm had a lot of thunderstorm activity near its center. On August 12, the NHC said that the storm was close to tropical storm-stength. While the storm was still alive, it was not called a tropical storm. However it was later found that the storm had actually reached tropical storm strength winds. The next day, the storm began to weaken and fall apart because of wind shear and dry air. The remains of the storm moved west across the Atlantic Ocean.\nOn August 14, the NHC saw that the storm was reforming. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter airplane flew into the storm and the NHC started to follow the storm again. On August 15, the storm was given the name \"Ana\" after it reached tropical storm strength. Soon wind shear started to affect Ana again. The next day, the storm moved into an area of dry air over the Caribbean Sea. Ana weakened into a depression after another Hurricane Hunter airplane found no tropical storm-winds. The storm's circulation fell apart and Ana finally died on August 17.\nPreparations and impact.\nOn August 15, a tropical storm watch was given to the islands of St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua, Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, and the United States Virgin Islands. Later on August 17, Puerto Rico, Dominica, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy were also put on tropical storm watch. When Ana weakened into a remnant low later that day, all watches were stopped.\nIn St. Thomas, wind speeds from Ana were recorded at 28\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h) and gusts peaked at 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). Also, a lot of rainfall created flooding in Puerto Rico. But there was only little damage done. At most, 4 in (100\u00a0mm) of rain fell on the island. Some streets had to be shut down because of the flooding. About 6,000 people lost electricity from the storm. Tree branches broke down power lines. People also reported tornadoes and waterspouts created by Ana in Puerto Rico. The remains of Ana brought rainfall to parts of Hispaniola. But no damage was reported."}

Suppressors are most often added to the gun barrel, usually by screwing the silencer onto the end of the barrel. Some guns have a built-in suppressor.\nEven though many people use the name \"silencer\" when talking about a suppressor, it does not really make the gun silent. How much quieter it makes the gun depends both on the cartridges and the suppressor. A suppressed gun usually is between 120 and 135 decibels (dB). This is much quieter than without the suppressor, but is still loud enough to cause hearing loss without protection such as earplugs. An unsuppressed firearm usually produces 140 to 165\u00a0dB. For comparison, a typical jackhammer produces about 130\u00a0dB.\nIn many places, suppressors are illegal to own except for the military and police. This is because suppressors make guns quieter and people worry this could help criminals commit crime.\nIn most states in the United States, suppressors are legal for civilians to own, but the National Firearms Act requires that buyers must go through a special background check and pay a $200 tax. Owning an untaxed suppressor is illegal, except for licensed class 3 firearms dealers, the military, and law enforcement."}

MissingNo. Pok\u00e9mon are used as error handlers by game developer Game Freak; they appear when the game tries to access data for a Pok\u00e9mon species that does not exist.\nFirst documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of \"Nintendo Power\", encountering MissingNo. results in messed up graphics and item duplication of the player's sixth item in their inventory.\nCharacteristics.\nThere are two reasons why the player encounters MissingNo., both as a result of programming bugs. The first is caused by the way the game stores battle information and the second is caused by the Old Man script in Viridian City. When traveling from one area to another, the game assigns numbers for Pok\u00e9mon that the player encounters to a data buffer, read by the game when they encounter a wild Pok\u00e9mon. However, on the right side of the Cinnabar and Seafoam Islands, no data is actually assigned to this buffer, and the information from the previous location is used instead (the player's name data).\nOnce encountered, players can fight, flee, or capture MissingNo. just like any other wild Pok\u00e9mon in the game. After encountering the MissingNo., the sixth item's quantity in the player's item menu will be multiplied by 128, and the game's \"Hall of Fame\" gallery will become damaged forever. Other display problems may happen, though these can be fixed by viewing a Pok\u00e9dex entry or resetting the Game Boy. It commonly appears as a scrambled \"d\" shaped rectangle, though sometimes (encounter values) it will look like a Ghost or two fossils.\nImpact.\nEven though it has only appeared in three games in Pok\u00e9mon, MissingNo. has had a lot of impact. Nintendo says it a \"programming quirk\" and doesn't want players to encounter it and later making impossible to obtain it in the next game, \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", unless a trade is done. However, information on how to encounter MissingNo. was printed in a lot of magazines and player's guides due to its effect, while some \"Pok\u00e9mon\" players tried to sell real and fake \"tips\" for capturing MissingNo. for up to $200. In 2009, IGN put MissingNo in their \"Top 10 Easter Eggs\" in games list, describing it as a \"glitchimon\" and saying it was useful for making copies of items. In another article, they said \"It really says something about \"Pok\u00e9mon\" fans that they took what is a potentially game ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pok\u00e9mon.\"\nReactions by players to MissingNo. has been studied by sociological studies regarding individuals and games. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge said in a study that Game Freak \"spawned one of the most popular glitches ever in game history\", due to the good and bad results of it and players' interesting use of it. The book \"Playing with video games\" studied the effect of MissingNo. deeply, studying players' curious actions as a result of its appearance and examining their own notes along with individual \"sightings\" reports, studying and criticizing other people's findings. The book further describes the extent to which gaming communities revolving around \"Pok\u00e9mon\" have attempted to make it a real aspect of the game's world through elements such as fan fiction and fan art, adding that this in turn inspires creativity. It also says that people were celebrating and publicizing glitches in the game while trying to make it canon, and adds that MissingNo. popularity was an unusual case."}

It campaigns mostly for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country. It is a social democratic party and is currently the largest party in the Scottish Parliament, with 62 out of 129 seats and its party leader Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of Scotland.\nHistory.\nThe Scottish National Party was founded in 1934. During World War II, its leader Douglas Young told Scottish people not to join the war effort and as a result he was widely disliked. The first SNP Member of Parliament was Robert McIntyre, who entered parliament in a by-election for Motherwell in 1945, but he lost the seat at the general election of that year. The party struggled in the 1950s but achieved greater success in the 1960s and in 1967, Winnie Ewing was elected as an MP for the party at a by-election in Hamilton. Only 1 seat was won by the SNP at the 1970 general election but at the February 1974 general election, it won 7 seats. Following the discovery of oil in the North Sea, the SNP ran a campaign called 'It's Scotland's oil' meaning that they thought it should benefit only the Scots and the party won 11 seats and 30% of the vote in Scotland at the October 1974 general election.\nWhen the Labour government of James Callaghan started losing its majority in parliament, it made deals with the smaller parties including the Liberal Party, the SNP and the Welsh nationalists. The SNP only agreed to support this if a referendum was given to the Scottish people on the creation of a devolved assembly. The referendum gained support from 51% of Scots but the Labour government decided that not enough people had voted in the referendum and because of this, the SNP refused to support the Labour government. The general election of 1979 saw the SNP reduced to only 2 seats in parliament.\nThe party did poorly at the general elections of 1983, 1987 and 1992. Alex Salmond became party leader in 1990 and in 1997, the party won 6 seats in parliament. The Labour government of Tony Blair established a Scottish Parliament in 1999 and at the elections held for the new parliament, the SNP came in second place behind Labour, with 35 out of 128 seats. It wasn't until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election that the SNP made another major breakthrough and at this election, the party won the most seats with 47 out of 128 seats and a minority government was then formed with Alex Salmond made First Minister.\nThe party tried to give Scotland a referendum on independence in 2010, but the other major parties in the Scottish Parliament stopped them. In 2011, they won 69 out of 129 seats in the election to the Scottish Parliament, and were able to govern alone. They held the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September 2014, where 55% of people voted against independence from the UK. Salmond resigned as First Minister of Scotland and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon. Under her leadership, the SNP won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom general election, 2015."}

There were florins, shillings, sixpences and threepences. They had a picture of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom on one side. Australian pennies and half-pennies started to be used the next year. In 1931 gold sovereigns, which had also been used before 1910, stopped being made in Australia. A crown (five shilling) coin was made for use between 1937 and 1938.

In 1914 20 pounds, 50 pounds, 100 pounds and 1000 pounds were also printed.

They all had King George V of the United Kingdom on the front.\nA new design was printed in 1933 with King George V, also in 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 10 pounds.

Modern engines use high degrees of compression. They therefore need fuel that does not detonate easily. Such fuel has a higher octane rating. The rating is done by comparing the fuel to the mixture of iso-octane and heptane that would detonate in the same way. Such a mixture of 90 percent iso-octane and 10 percent heptane has an octane rating of 90. Gas is available with lower octane ratings in the US than in Europe.\nThe octane rating of gasoline tells you how much the fuel can be compressed before it spontaneously ignites. When gas ignites by compression rather than because of the spark from the spark plug, it causes knocking in the engine. Knocking can damage an engine, so it is not something you want to have happening. Lower-octane gas (like \"regular\" 87-octane gasoline) can handle the least amount of compression before igniting."}

He said that it is not possible to prove or disprove that God exists. Therefore, it is better to bet that God exists. If God existed, and the person believed in God, he would be rewarded (with happiness forever); if the person did not believe, he would be punished (with what is called \"eternal damnation\"). If God did not exist it would make no difference. For this reason, it would be better to believe in God, Pascal said. Indeed, Pascal strongly believed in this ideal. \nPascal's argument is a simple one: reason and intellect cannot decide the question of whether God exists or not; therefore, it makes sense to choose the option that would benefit us most should we be right. Accordingly, the options would be as follows: \n1. You may live a religious and moral life and be rewarded by eternal happiness.\n2. You may live a pleasure-seeking life and be denied eternal happiness.\n3. You may live a holy life but there is actually no God or eternal life.\n4. You may live a pleasure-seeking life but it makes no difference because there is no God. \nFor Pascal, the first of these options is the most important one because it represents the maximum gain and loss. Even if it should turn out that there is no God, the sheer risk of deciding against such a possibility warrants that we should take that option.\nThe case against Pascal's Wager.\nThe argument from inconsistent revelations shows we have no idea which hell to avoid since many different religions exist with different beliefs about hell. Within religions there are different denominations and sects with different ideas about heaven and hell. If we try to avoid the hell that Christians believe in we are at risk from the hell Muslims believe. So it goes on. Perhaps God does not like people who accept Pascal's Wager but god may not mind that atheists doubt. Atheists and believers could both be in trouble or neither could be in trouble. \nFurther two of the three Abrahamic religions, Christianity and Islam claim worshiping other gods is sinful. Judaism, however is different, being older and clarifies that as long as you acknowledge the existence of the G-D of Abraham, and don't blaspheme the name, you do not need to worship any deity, and may worship any you like. The loss of understanding and ignoring the Noahide Laws has muddled the issue.\nWe have no proof that any particular deity is real, but as there is no wrong deity as long as you acknowledge the Abrahamic one, meaning Paschal's Wager stands, belief is the only safe bet.\nImportance in history.\nPierre de Fermat and Pascal created probability theory. Pascal's Wager was very important for the time, because it did new things with probability theory. It is also one of the first tries to use the concept of infinity, and the first use of decision theory. It was important for other philosophers who developed the ideas of pragmatism and voluntarism."}

It is the shape of the Earth and some other planets. It is like a sphere squashed from the top so the circumference around the poles is less than the circumference around the equator. Shapes of this type are called ellipsoids.\nOblate spheroids have rotational symmetry around an axis from pole to pole.\nMany planets, including the Earth and Saturn, are oblate spheroids. The difference between a sphere and the Earth's shape is small, only about one part in 300.\nStars spin, and some spin very fast. The faster the spin, the flatter the oblate spheroid. The Sun rotates at 2 km per second, neutron stars have speeds of thousands of km/sec.\nOrigin of flattening.\nIn 1687 Isaac Newton published the \"Principia\". He included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid of revolution (a spheroid). The amount of flattening depends on the density and the balance of gravitational force and centrifugal force.\nIn other words, the Earth is a spheroid because it rotates. Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are flattened by rotation more than the Earth."}

But only at the end of the first millennium the Republic of Venice started to conquest Dalmatia.\nIndeed, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Illyrian towns on the dalmatian coast continued to speak Latin and their language evolved relatively independent from other Romance languages, progressing toward a regional variant and finally to a distinct language called \"Dalmatian language\".\nThe earliest reference on the language dates from the 10th century and it is estimated that about 50,000 people spoke it at that time (according to the linguist Matteo Bartoli).\nThe Dalmatian language is an extinct Romance language that was spoken along the eastern Adriatic in the Dalmatian coast from Fiume (Rijeka) as far south as Kotor (Cattaro) in Montenegro.\nThe Dalmatian speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of Zadar, Trogir, Split, Dubrovnik and Kotor (\"Zara, Tra\u00f9, Spalato, Ragusa\" and \"Cattaro\" in Italian), each of these cities having a local dialect, and also on the islands of Krk, Cres and Rab (\"Veglia, Cherso\" and \"Arbe\")\nAlmost every city developed its own dialect, but the most important dialects we have information on are the \"Vegliot\" a northern dialect, spoken on the island of Krk (\"Veglia\" in Italian, \"Vikla\" in Dalmatian) and the \"Ragusan\"', a southern dialect, spoken at Dubrovnik (\"Ragusa\" in both Italian and Dalmatian).\nThe dialect of Zara disappeared because of the strong Venetian influence while the two other dialects due even to the assimilation by Slavic language speakers.\nWe know about the dalmatian dialect of Ragusa from two letters, from 1325 and 1397, and other medieval texts, which show a language influenced heavily by Venetian. The available sources include hardly 260 Ragusan words. Surviving words include \"pen\" (bread), \"teta\" (father), \"chesa\" (house) and \"fachir\" (to do), which were quoted by an Italian, Fillipo Diversi, the head of school of Ragusa in the 1430s.\nThe \"Republic of Ragusa\" had at one time an important fleet, but its influence decreased. We know that the language was in trouble in the face of Croatian expansion, as the Ragusan Senate decided that all debates had to be held in \"lingua veteri ragusea\" (ancient Ragusan language) and the use of the \"lingua sclava\" (Croatian) was forbidden. Nevertheless, in the 16th century, Ragusan fell out of use and became extinct.\nOther languages influenced the Ddalmatian language, but without erasing its Latin roots (superstrates): the Slavs, then the Republic of Venice. Several cities of the regions have Italian names, and other mostly the romanized Illyrian ones (like Zara, Spalato, etc..)\nThe oldest preserved documents written in Dalmatian are some 13th century inventories, in the Ragusan dialect. A letter of the 14th century from Zara (Zadar) shows strong Venetian influence, which was also the cause of its extinction soon after.\nThe Christian schism was an important factor in the history of Dalmatia. While the Croatian-held branch of the Catholic Church in Nin was under Pope's jurisdiction, they still used the Slavic liturgy. Both the Latin population of the cities and the Holy See preferred the Latin liturgy, which created tensions between different dioceses.\nThe great schism between Eastern and Western Christianity of 1054 further intensified the rift between the coastal cities and the hinterland, with many of the Slavs in the hinterland preferring the Eastern Orthodoxy. Areas of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina also had an indigenous \"Bosnian Church\" which was often mistaken for \"Bogomils\".\nThe Latin influence in Dalmatia was increased and the Byzantine practices were further suppressed on the general synods of 1059-1060, 1066, 1075-1076 and on other local synods, notably by demoting the bishopric of Nin, installing the archbishoprics of Spalatum (Split) and Dioclea (Montenegro), and explicitly forbidding use of any liturgy other than Greek or Latin.\nThe Republic of Venice.\nDalmatia never attained a political or racial unity and never formed as a \"nation\", but it achieved a remarkable development of art, science and literature. Politically, the neolatin Dalmatian city-states were often isolated and compelled to either fall back on the Venetian Republic for support, or tried to make it on their own.\nThe geographical position of the Dalmatian city states suffices to explain the relatively small influence exercised by Byzantine culture throughout the six centuries (535-1102) during which Dalmatia was part of the Eastern empire. Towards the close of this period Byzantine rule tended more and more to become merely nominal, while the influence of the Republic of Venice increased.\nThe medieval Dalmatia had still included much of the hinterland covered by the old Roman province of Dalmatia. However, the toponym of \"Dalmatia\" started to shift more towards including only the coastal, Adriatic areas, rather than the mountains inland. By the 15th century, the word \"Herzegovina\" would be introduced, marking the shrink of the borders of Dalmatia to the narrow littoral area where was spoken the Dalmatian language (that was being assimilated into the venetian language).\nIn the thirteenth century the Republic of Venice took definitive control of the Montenegro coast and created the \"Albania Veneta\".\nRepublic of Venice and the Kingdom of Hungary in Dalmatia.\nAs the city states gradually lost all protection by Byzantium, being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions, they had to turn to either Venice or Hungary for support. Each of the two political factions had support within the Dalmatian city states, based mostly on economic reasons.\nThe Venetians, to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture, could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic.\nThe seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as mistress of the Adriatic. In return for protection, the cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. Arbe (Rab), for example, annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice.\nHungary, on the other hand, defeated the last Croat king in 1097 and laid claim on all lands of the Croatian noblemen since the treaty of 1102. King Coloman of Hungary proceeded to conquer Dalmatia in 1102-1105.\nThe farmers and the merchants who traded in the interior favoured Hungary as their most powerful neighbour on land that affirmed their municipal privileges.\nSubject to the royal assent they might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges. Their Roman law remained valid. They were even permitted to conclude separate alliances. No alien, not even a Hungarian, could live in a city where he was unwelcome; and the man who disliked Hungarian dominion could emigrate with all his household and property. In lieu of tribute, the revenue from customs was in some cases shared equally by the king, chief magistrate, bishop and municipality.\nThese rights and the analogous privileges granted by Venice were, however, too frequently infringed. Hungarian garrisons were being quartered on unwilling towns, while Venice interfered with trade, the appointment of bishops, or the tenure of communal domains. Consequently, the Dalmatians remained loyal only while it suited their interests, and insurrections frequently occurred. Even in Zara four outbreaks are recorded between 1180 and 1345, although Zadar was treated with special consideration by its Venetian masters, who regarded its possession as essential to their maritime ascendancy.\nThe once rival Romanic and Slavic population eventually started contributing to a common civilization, and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) was the primary example of this. By the 13th century, the councilmen from ragusan names were mixed, and in the 15th century the ragusan literature was even written in the Slavic language (from which Croatian language is directly descended), and the city was often called by its Slavic name, Dubrovnik. Only in 1918 Ragusa was called officially \"Dubrovnik\", with the creation of Yugoslavia.\nThe doubtful allegiance of the Dalmatians tended to protract the struggle between Venice and Hungary, which was further complicated by internal discord due largely to the spread of the \"Bogomil heresy\", and by many outside influences.\nThe cities of Zara (Zadar), Spalato (Split), Trau (Trogir) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice, Hungary and the Byzantium during the 12th century.\nIn 1202, the armies of the Fourth Crusade rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Zadar for it. In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory.\nThe early 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities. The Dalmatian cities started accepting foreign sovereignty (mainly of the Republic of Venice) but eventually they reverted to their previous desire for independence. The Mongol invasion severely impaired Hungary, so much that in 1241, the king Bela IV had to take refuge in Dalmatia (in the Klis fortress). The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew.\nThe Croats were no longer regarded by the city folk as a hostile people, in fact the power of certain Croatian magnates, notably the counts \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir, was from time to time supreme in the northern districts (in the period between 1295 and 1328).\nIn 1346, Dalmatia was struck by the Black Death. The economic situation was also poor, and the cities became more and more dependent on Venice.\nStephen Tvrtko, the founder of the \"Bosnian kingdom\", was able in 1389 to annex the Adriatic littoral between Cattaro and Sebenico (\u0160ibenik), and even claimed control over the northern coast up to Fiume (Rijeka) except for the Venetian-ruled Zara (Zadar), and his own independent ally, Ragusa (Dubrovnik). This was only temporary, as the Hungarians and the Venetians continued their struggle over Dalmatia as soon as Tvrtko died in 1391.\nAn internal struggle of Hungary, between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou, also reflected on Dalmatia: in the early 15th century, all Dalmatian cities welcomed the Neapolitan fleet except for Dubrovnik (Ragusa). The Bosnian duke Hrvoje controlled Dalmatia for the Angevins, but later switched loyalty to Sigismund.\nOver the period of twenty years, this struggle weakened the Hungarian influence. In 1409, Ladislaus of Naples sold his \"rights\" over Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 \"Ducats\". Venice gradually took over most of Dalmatia by 1420. In 1437, Sigismund recognized Venetian rule over Dalmatia in return for 100,000 Ducats. The city of Omi\u0161 yielded to Venice in 1444, and only Ragusa (Dubrovnik) preserved temporarily its freedom.\nThe rule of Venice on most of Dalmatia will last nearly four centuries (1420 - 1797).\nVenetian and Ottoman rule in Dalmatia.\nDuring the Venetian rule in Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 the number of Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia was increased by numerous migrations.\nAn interval of peace ensued, but meanwhile the Ottoman advance continued.\nHungary was itself assailed by the Turks, and could no longer afford to try to control Dalmatia. Christian kingdoms and regions in the east fell one by one, Constantinople in 1453, Serbia in 1459, neighbouring Bosnia in 1463, and Herzegovina in 1483. Thus the Venetian and Ottoman frontiers met and border wars were incessant.\nDubrovnik sought safety in friendship with the invaders, and in one particular instance, actually sold two small strips of its territory (Neum and Sutorina) to the Ottomans in order to prevent land access from the Venetian territory.\nIn 1508 the hostile \"League of Cambrai\" compelled Venice to withdraw its garrison for home service, and after the overthrow of Hungary in 1526 the Turks were able easily to conquer the greater part of Dalmatia by 1537. The peace of 1540 left only the maritime cities to Venice, the interior forming a Turkish province, governed from the fortress of Klis by a \"Sanjakbeg\" (an administrator with military powers).\nChristian Croats from the neighbouring lands now thronged to the towns, outnumbering the Romanic population even more, and making their language the primary one. The pirate community of the \"Uskoks\" had originally been a band of these fugitives, especially near Segna (Senj); its exploits contributed to a renewal of war between Venice and Turkey (1571-1573). An extremely curious picture of contemporary manners is presented by the Venetian agents, whose reports on this war resemble some knightly chronicle of the Middle Ages, full of single combats, tournaments and other chivalrous adventures. They also show clearly that the Dalmatian levies far surpassed the Italian mercenaries in skill and courage. Many of these troops served abroad; at the Battle of Lepanto, for example, in 1571, a Dalmatian squadron assisted the allied fleets of Spain, Venice, Austria and the Papal States to crush the Turkish navy.\nThe continental bits of Dalmatia were under Ottoman rule, parts of the Viyalet of Bosnia or the Klis Sanjak. The desolated areas of the Knin Frontier and Bukovica were inhabited by Orthodox Serbs from Bosnia, while the Albania veneta received constant Serb migrations from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The Serbs formed one quarter of Dalmatia's population in the 16th century. They had absolute majority in the Knin Frontier, Bukovica and the Cattaro area. The Ottomans have resettled this populace to create a living defence towards the territories of the Venetian Republic. A great portion of this population fled to Venetian land and gladly fought against the Ottomans. The number of Serbs in Venetian Dalmatia rapidly increased during the War of Crete in 1645 - 1669 and the Great Viennese War in 1683 - 1699, after which the \"Peace of Karlowitz\" gave the whole of Dalmatia and coastal Montenegro (from Sutorina to Cattaro) to the Venetian Republic. After the Venetian-Turkish war of 1714-1718, Venetian territorial gains were confirmed by the 1718 \"Treaty of Passarowitz\". The number of Dalmatian Serbs remained between \"20%\" and \"25%\" by the end of Venetian rule, while the venetian speaking population in the Dalmatian cities and islands increased with colonists from north-east Italy.\nThe Serbian peasant population of infertile Upper Dalmatia was freed of \"Feudal bonds\", according that they fight wars for the Venetian Republic. The Serbs living in urban area of cities in Dalmatia were much wealthier. The Serbs in Dalmatia with Boka have had strong national and religious determination through numerous old monasteries as beacons of culture and faith. Such were the early 14th century Krupa, Krka and Dragovi\u0107 monasteries in the Knin Frontier and Bukovica. The Serbs in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) had much more cultural advancement due to the nearby Cetinje capital area, and the Venetians had to fall back from influencing the religious life of people there.\nDalmatia was the largest Europe's concentration of Roman Catholic Bishops, Priesthood, Churches, Monasteries and religious institutions. The Catholic Bishops controlled the Orthodox Episcopy in Dalmatia by naming the Eastern Othodox Christian Episcopes themselves.\nDalmatia experienced a period of intense economic and cultural growth in the 18th century, given how trade routes with the hinterland were reestablished in peace. Christians that noticeably migrated from the Ottoman-held territory into the Dalmatian cities converted from Orthodoxy to Catholicism.\nBecause the Venetians were able to reclaim some of the inland territories in the north during the Turkish wars, the region of Dalmatia was no longer restricted to the coastline and the islands. However, the Venetian influence wasn't as strong in the former southern Dalmatia, meaning that the toponym did not extend inland into areas of Herzegovina or Montenegro.\nThis period was abruptly interrupted with the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797.\nNapoleon united for the last time Dalmatia and Venice in his \"Kingdom of Italy\" in 1805. After his fall Venice followed the history of Italy with the Risorgimento, while Dalmatia was aggregated to the Austro-Hungarian Empire."}

The VI scale goes from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst, and 100 being the best. New products are now better than when the scale was first made, so some new products have scores as high as 400.\nLubricating oil is meant to reduce friction between two surfaces. If it is too viscous the oil will be thick and sticky and need too much energy to keep the parts moving. If the oil is too thin, then the parts will rub together and create friction. What is needed is an oil that has just the right amount of viscosity to keep the two surfaces apart. Oil becomes less viscous as the temperature goes up. In an automobile engine, the oil needs to be viscous at a range of temperatures. It needs to work when the engine is first started and is cold, and keep working when the engine gets very hot, perhaps as much as 200 \u00b0C. The best oils, with a high viscosity index score, will keep their viscosity the same across the temperature range.\nThe scale was made up by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)."}

It contained wrestlers from the Smackdown, ECW, and RAW brands. The name of the event was voted by fans via WWE's official website. Breaking Point was chosen over Submission Sunday, Total Submission, and Submit &amp; Quit.\nBackground.\nBreaking Point contained seven professional wrestling matches, with the three main event matches being held under submission rules. The event involved wrestlers from all three Brands, Raw, WWE SmackDown and ECW. The wrestlers portrayed either a good guy or a bad guy as they followed a series of events which led to a wrestling match or a series of wrestling matches.\nOn the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the main event for the Raw brand was announced, it was to be a rematch from the previous nights SummerSlam PPV, Randy Orton would again defend the WWE Championship against John Cena. Due to the controversy surrounding the previous nights match, which involved the match being restarted due to a disqualification, count-out and Orton's use of illegal leverage.\nVince McMahon granted Cena a rematch as a result of Orton's actions, in a response to the interference from Brett DiBiase at SummerSlam, McMahon stated if anyone were to interfere on Orton's behalf he would lose the WWE Championship. The Championship was defended in an \"I Quit\" match, where the opponent is won by making the opponent say \"I Quit\".\nAfter winning the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, it was announced CM Punk would defend the Championship the following week on the August 28, 2009 (taped August 25, 2009) edition against Jeff Hardy and the winner would face The Undertaker at Breaking Point in a Submission match, where the only way to win is by making your opponent Submit.\nOn the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the Guest host for the night was weltherweight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr. who previously had a match with The Big Show at WrestleMania XXIV in 2008. Due to lingering bitterness from their WrestleMania match, Mayweather announced an exhibition match between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Mark Henry versus Unified Tag Team Champions Big Show and Chris Jericho, with an added stipulation that if MVP and Henry won they would face Show and Jericho for the Unified Tag Team Championship at Breaking Point. During the match MVP and Henry gained their chance when Mayweather handed MVP brass knuckles to knock Jericho out and pin Jericho for the win.\nOn the July 27, 2009 edition of Raw, to decide the opponent for the current WWE Champion Randy Orton at Night of Champions, a \"beat the clock\" challenge was set up, Triple H had to defeat his opponent Cody Rhodes in under a set time of 6 minutes and 49 seconds set by Mark Henry. Triple H was unsuccessful in his attempt, this match was followed by Rhodes with assistance from The Legacy team member Ted DiBiase beating down Triple H. This event led to Triple H seeking help from Shawn Michaels to reform the group, D-Generation X (DX), to face and beat Rhodes and DiBiase at SummerSlam. Following the weeks of SummerSlam DX was continuously beat down by The Legacy which resulted in an announcement on WWE.com that the two teams would face at Breaking Point, in a Submissions Count Anywhere match."}

The Venetian territories never reached more than 20\u00a0km from the Adriatic Sea. After 1573 the southern limit was moved to the village of Confin (Kufin) near Budua (Budva), because of the Ottoman conquests of Antivari (Bar), and Dulcigno (Ulcinj) in the Balkans.\nThe Dominions of Venice were centered around the \"Bocche di Cattaro\" (Bay of Kotor) and included the small cities of Cattaro (Kotor), Risano (Risan), Perasto (Perast), Teodo (Tivat), Castelnuovo (Herceg Novi), Budua (Budva) and Spizza (Sutomore).\nHistory.\nVenice started to take control of the small southern Dalmatian villages around the 10th century, assimilating quickly the neolatin \"Dalmatian language\" of the coastal areas into the Venetian language. But only in the 14th century was the Republic of Venice able to create a territorial continuity around the Bay of Kotor. These Venetian dominions around Cattaro (Kotor) lasted from 1420 to 1797 and were called \"Albania Veneta\", a historical province of the Republic of Venice.\nWhen the Turks started to conquer the Balkans in 15th century, many Christian Slavs took refuge inside Venetian Dalmatia and so even the \"Albania Veneta\" started to have a huge Serb and Albanian population. By the end of 17th century the Romance speaking population of the historical \"Albania Veneta\" was already a minority, according to Oscar Randi in his book \"\"Dalmazia etnica, incontri e fusioni\".\nAfter the Napoleonic armies conquered and put an end to the Republic of Venice in 1797, the area of the Albania veneta changed control many times:\nin 1805 was annexed to the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\", then in 1809 was part of French \"Illyrian Provinces\" and finally in 1815 was put under Habsburg control in the Dalmatia of the Austrian Empire.\nUnder the Habsburg domination, \"Albania Veneta\" was part of \"Austrian Dalmatia\" and in 1878 (at the \"Congress of Berlin\") another 40 km\u00b2 around Sutomore were added to this territory.\nThe borders of the former Venetian province of \"Albania Veneta\" changed again in 1918, when was created the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but were reinstated from 1941 to 1943 during World War II, when Mussolini annexed the territories around Cattaro to the Kingdom of Italy. The area was part of the Italian \"Governatorato di Dalmazia\" and was called \"Provincia di Cattaro\".\nAfter World War II any political entity related to the historical presence of Venice in southern Dalmatia ceased to exist and the area was definitely incorporated into Yugoslavia.\nThe old \"Albania Veneta\" is currently a coastal region of the newly independent Montenegro.\nHistory of the Venetian speaking population of \"Albania Veneta\".\nAccording to the Dalmatian historian Luigi Paulucci (in his book \"Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810\") the population of the \"Albania Veneta\", during the centuries of the Republic of Venice, was mainly Venetian speaking (approximately 66%) in the urban areas (Cattaro, Perasto, Budua, ecc..) around the \"Bocche di Cattaro\" (Bay of Kotor).\nBut in the inland areas more than half of the population was Serbo-Croatian speaking, after the first years of the eighteenth century. Paulucci wrote even that near the border with Albania there were big communities of Albanian speaking people: Dulcigno (Ulcinj) was half Albanian, one quarter Venetian and one quarter Slavic-speaking.\nDuring the French rule of the area of Cattaro the schools were in Italian, when the former Albania Veneta was part of the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\". \nThe Slovenian Marko Trogrli in his essay \"The French school system in French Dalmatia\" wrote that \"Vincenzo Dandolo, the French governor of Dalmatia as well as Bartolomeo Benincasa, an official from the local (Dalmatian) Education Department, published in May 1807 a plan for the province's public education (\"Il piano generale della pubblica istruzione in Dalmazia\"), which had to be consistent with the education system throughout the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy...Instruction was to be in Italian\".\nDuring the nineteenth century, according to the historian Scaglioni Marzio, the wars of independence of Italy from the Austro-Hungarian empire created a situation of harassment against the Italian (or Venetian speaking) communities in the Austrian southern Dalmatia.\nThe result was that in 1880 there were in Cattaro, according to the Austrian census, only 930 ethnic Italians (or only 32% of a total population of 2910 people).\nFurthermore, in the Austrian census of 1910, the Italians were reduced to only 13.6% in that city, according to Diego De Castro in his book \"Dalmazia, popolazione e composizione etnica. Cenno storico sul rapporto etnico tra Italiani e Slavi nella Dalmazia\".\nThere are currently 500 Italian speakers in Montenegro, mainly in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) and Perasto (Perast), who constitute the \"Comunit\u00e1 Nazionale Italiana del Montenegro\".\nThe \"disappearance\" of the Italian speaking populations in Dalmatia was nearly complete after World War II. The linguist Matteo Bartoli calculated that the Italians were 33% of the Dalmatian population during the Napoleonic wars, while currently there are only 300 Italians in Croatian Dalmatia and 500 Italians in coastal Montenegro."}

The name comes from the Greek word for \"sun flower\". The Heliantheae is the third largest tribe in the sunflower family, which has 190 genera and about 2500 species. Only the tribes Senecioneae and Astereae are larger. Most Heliantheae come from North America and South America, and Mexico. A few genera come from tropical areas.\nMost Heliantheae are herbs or shrubs, but there are some that grow to the size of small trees. Leaves are usually hairy and arranged in opposite pairs. The anthers are usually black.\nUses.\nHeliantheae can be grown on farms. These include sunflowers and jerusalem artichokes. Many garden flowers are also in this group, such as \"Coreopsis\", \"Cosmos\", \"Echinacea\", \"Rudbeckia\", and \"Zinnia\".\nThere are also some weeds in the family. Species of \"Ambrosia\" (ragweed) produce lots of pollen. Each plant can produce about a billion grains of pollen over a season, and the plant is wind-pollinated. It is one of the main causes of hay fever.\nSubtribes.\nIn 1981 Harold Ernest Robinson came up with a new way to describe the tribe. He divided Heliantheae into 35 subtribes:"}

It is a type of cluster B personality disorder. People diagnosed with BPD are often very impulsive, and generally have a low self-esteem. Moods often change quickly. For these reasons, these people often have trouble keeping a stable relationship. Frequently, people with BPD also suffer from other conditions, such as clinical depression or they show self-harming behavior. Treating people with BPD is difficult, and is usually done using a combination of therapy and drugs.\nC.H.Huges used the term \"Borderland\", to describe a number of conditions bordering mental health issues. Adolf Stern gave a description of some of the symptoms in 1938, and called them \"border line group\". People showed both conditions related to psychosis, and related to neurosis, so the term was thought fitting, at the time.\nSymptoms.\nPeople diagnosed with BPD have strong mood swings. They see things as \"all good\" or \"all bad\" (splitting), and are frequently confused about their identity. They usually have a lot of trouble with relationships with people. They have strong emotions which often change quickly. They are often reckless, destructive or self-destructive.\nEmotions.\nPeople with BPD feel emotions more easily, more deeply and for longer than others do.[10][11] Emotions may repeatedly return and last a long time.[11] Because of this, it may take longer than normal for people with BPD to return to a normal and stable emotional state.[12] This can have both positive and negative effects.[12] People with BPD are often very happy and loving.[13] People with BPD are also often sad and mad. They feel emotions in a stronger way than most people - grief instead of sadness, rage instead of being annoyed, and panic instead of being anxious.[13] People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of being abandoned, being alone, and being a \"failure\". They are often aware of how strong their emotions are, and, since they cannot control them, they sometimes shut them down entirely.[12]\nTheir emotions are intense and their emotions are also quick to change. The most common mood swings they have are between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety.[17]\nBehavior.\nPeople with BPD often act impulsively, which means they do things or say things without thinking. This behavior can be dangerous, and includes: abusing drugs or alcohol, eating too much or too little, having unsafe sex or frequent sex with multiple partners, spending a lot of money, and driving dangerously. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away and self-injury.[19]\nPeople with BPD sometimes act impulsively because it gives them instant relief from their emotional pain.[19] However, in the long term people with BPD go through more pain from the shame and guilt that follow these actions.[19] A cycle often begins where people with BPD feels emotional pain and acts impulsively to relieve that pain. Then they feel bad about what they did, and have strong urges to act impulsively to relieve the new pain.[19] As time goes on, impulsive behavior may start to be an automatic reaction to emotional pain.[19]\nSelf-harm and suicide.\nSelf-injury is common for people with BPD. Sometimes people hurt themselves without wanting to commit suicide. Common methods include cutting, burning, head banging, and drug overdose. The reasons people with BPD give for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are different from their reasons for suicide attempts. Reasons they give for hurting themselves include expressing anger, punishing themselves, creating normal feelings, and distracting themselves from emotional pain or difficult situations. When suicide is the goal, they usually attempt suicide with the belief that others will be better off without them. Both suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury are a response to feeling negative emotions.\nInterpersonal relationships.\nPeople with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them. They can feel very happy and grateful when they feel someone has been nice to them, and very sad or angry when they feel someone has been hurtful to them. Their feelings about others often switch from positive to negative if they feel like they might lose someone, if they think someone important to them does not care about them, or if something is not as good as they expected. They think in extremes, seeing things or people as \"all good\" or \"all bad\". This is sometimes called black-and-white thinking. It includes a change from admiring someone to devaluing them, often feeling pure anger or dislike.[28] The way they see themselves can also change quickly from positive to negative.\nWhile strongly wanting to feel closeness, people with BPD tend to be anxious, have mixed feelings, or be paranoid when it comes to their relationships. They often view the world as dangerous and bad. BPD is linked to high levels of stress and conflict in romantic relationships, abuse, and unwanted pregnancy. These things are also common with other types of personality disorders.\nSense of self.\nPeople with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear picture of their identity. It is difficult for them to know what they value and love.[35] They often do not know about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs. They often have trouble making decisions and can change their minds quickly. These difficulties can cause people with BPD to feel \"empty\" and \"lost\".[35]\nCognitions.\nPeople with BPD are easily bored and it is hard for them to concentrate.[35] People with BPD may tend to disconnect or \"dissociate\" from people and things around them, which can be thought of as an intense form of \"zoning out\".[36] This often happens in response to a painful event, or something that triggers the memory of a painful event. This can give make the person feel better for a short time, it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking ordinary feelings. This has the result of keeping people with BPD from learning how to handle these feelings, and can make it difficult for them to make positive choices when they feel these emotions.[36] Sometimes other people can see when someone with BPD is dissociating because the expressions in their face or voice can seem emotionless, or they look like they are distracted. Sometimes when someone with BPD is dissociating, other people are not able to see or know that it is happening. [36]\nDiagnosis.\nPsychiatrists and other mental health professionals diagnose people with BPD using a book called the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-IV-TR). They look at a person's behaviour and how they are feeling. If the person has five or more of the following signs, the DSM-IV-TR says that they have BPD.\nComorbidity.\nNearly all people with BPD also have other mental health problems, such as: mood disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders (especially post-traumatic stress disorder), and other personality disorders including Haltlose personality disorder. \nMost struggle with substance abuse and/or addictions. Self-harm and suicidal behavior are also common.\nOther illnesses that often happen with BPD include diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, arthritis, and fibromyalgia.\nCause.\nThe cause for BPD is not known. There may be several causes for people developing BPD. Some researchers think that it might be caused by trauma in childhood, such as sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect. Many people with BPD were abused when they were children. Modern thinking as demonstrated by functioning MRI scans is that neurotransmitters within the brain are not working correctly, and messages are not conducted in the usual way. \nSome studies of twins and families suggest that personality disorders may be inherited or strongly associated with other mental health disorders among family members.\nRisk factors.\nSome factors related to personality development can increase the risk of developing borderline personality disorder. These include:\nTreatment.\nTreating BPD is very difficult and takes a long time. Today, most people with BPD are treated with different kinds of psychotherapy. One of these is called dialectical behavioral therapy. In addition to therapy, drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilizers are often used. Many sufferers recover within 10 years."}

Where these traits would be flexible in most people, these traits are rigid and unworkable in someone with a personality disorder and create lasting patterns and often lasting problems. These thoughts, feelings and behaviours can cause problems for the person, and for other people around them.

They are split into three \"clusters\" or groups.\nCluster A.\nCluster A is the odd or eccentric group of personality disorders. They have similarities with schizophrenia. They are:\nCluster B.\nCluster B is the dramatic or emotional group of personality disorders. They are:\nAll Cluster B disorders are comorbid with each other.

It was formed on May 9, 1901. The parliament is bicameral, which means it has two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. It was copied mainly from the way the United Kingdom's Parliament was run, the Westminster system, but it also has some ideas from the United States Congress. The laws which control the way the parliament is set up and its powers are part of the Australian Constitution. The Parliament meets in a special building, Parliament House, in Canberra.\nThe parliament has four main functions:\nThe Australian Parliament first met in the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne in 1901. It then took over the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne until it moved to Canberra in 1927. A new building for the Parliament was finished in 1988 to celebrate 200 years of European settlement in Australia.\nHouse of Representatives.\nThere are 150 members of the House of Representatives, each one elected for a three year term. Each member represents about 150,000 people living in an electorate. The boundaries of each electorate are often changed to keep the number of people in each electorate is the same. The size of each electorate can be very different. The electorate of Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, covers an area of 2.3 million square kilometres, while Wentworth in New South Wales is only 26 square kilometres.\nThe government is formed by the political party (or group of political parties) who have the most members in the House. The House is set out in the British style, even using the green colours of the House of Commons. The Speaker sits at the front; the members of the government sit on the seats to his right, and the opposition sits on the seats to his left. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, government ministers, and the shadow ministers, sit at a large table in the centre.\nSenate.\nThe Senate is the upper house of the Australian Parliament. There are 76 members in the Senate. There are 12 senators for each Australian state, and 2 for each territory. The Senate makes and changes legislation. To become law, legislation must be passed by both houses and then be signed by the Governor-General.\nThe colours in the Australian Senate are red, as in the British House of Lords. The senators sit in a U shape around a central table. The head of the Senate, known as the President, sits at the head of the table. On his right are the government senators, and on his left the opposition. Senators from minor political parties and Independent senators sit at the bottom of the U shape."}

The painting hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the capital of Spain. It was painted in 1656.\nThe word \u201cMenina\u201d means \u201clady-in-waiting\u201d or \u201cMaid of Honour\u201d, i.e. a girl who serves in a royal court. There is a lot of detail in the painting, and more has been written about it than about almost any other Western painting because it is quite complicated. For example: people do not always agree about who is looking at whom and why they are standing there.\nDescription of the painting.\n\"Las Meninas\" shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Phillip IV of Spain . Several people are in the painting, and we know who they are. Some are looking at one another and others are looking out from the painting at the viewer (the person who is looking at the painting).\nThe person who stands in the middle is the Infanta Margarita Teresa of Austria (the princess, daughter of the king and queen). She has two maids of honour, one on each side of her, a chaperone, a bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Vel\u00e1zquez has also painted himself, standing just behind the princess and her companions. He is standing at the artist\u2019s easel. He has stopped painting for a moment and looks straight out at the viewer. At the back of the room is a mirror in which we can see the top halves of the bodies of the king and queen. This means that the king and queen are the viewers who are looking at the painting. The king and queen are probably being painted by Vel\u00e1zquez, but not everybody agrees with this.\nVel\u00e1zquez was very famous in his lifetime. He painted portraits of several royal people at the Spanish court. Philip himself did not like being painted when he was old, but he allowed Vel\u00e1zquez to include him in \"Las Meninas\". He had given Vel\u00e1zquez a special room where he could paint, and he often sat and watched the painter at work in his studio.\nThe painting was damaged a bit by a fire in 1734 and some of it was repainted, including the left cheek of the Infanta. In recent years it lost some of its colour, partly due to the pollution caused by so many visitors to the gallery. It was cleaned in 1984. Some people thought it made the picture look different.\nThe people in \"Las Meninas\" are in Vel\u00e1zquez's studio in the royal palace. The Infanta Margarita Teresa of Austria (number 1 in the key picture) in the middle of the picture is five years old. She later married the Roman Emperor Leopold. She has two ladies-in-waiting (\"meninas\"): do\u00f1a Isabel de Velasco\u00a0(2), who is about to curtsy to the princess, and do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor\u00a0(3), who kneels in front of Margarita, offering her a drink from a red cup, or \"bucaro\", that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: Maribarbola (4) who was German, and Nicolas Pertusato\u00a0(5) who was Italian. He is trying to wake up a dog by his feet. Behind them stands do\u00f1a Marcela de Ulloa\u00a0(6), the princess's chaperone, dressed in mourning and talking to a bodyguard (or \"guardadamas\")\u00a0(7). We do not know the name of the bodyguard.\nAt the back on the right stands Don Jos\u00e9 Nieto Vel\u00e1zquez\u00a0(8)\u2014the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, and the head of the royal tapestry works\u2014who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. We are not sure what he is doing. None of the people in the picture can see him. Only the viewer (the king and queen?) can.\nVel\u00e1zquez himself\u00a0(9) stands to the left of the scene, looking outward past a large canvas supported by an easel. On his chest is the red cross of the Order of Santiago, which he did not receive until 1659, three years after the painting was completed. He later added the cross to the painting.\nThe mirror on the back wall reflects the upper bodies and heads of the King Philip\u00a0IV\u00a0(10) and his queen, Mariana\u00a0(11). Most people think that they are being painted by Vel\u00e1zquez, and that their daughter, the Infanta, is watching them."}

{"id": "197058", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197058", "title": "Moon landing conspiracy theories", "text": "The moon landing conspiracy theories (also known as moon landing hoax or Apollo hoax) are beliefs that men did not land on the Moon in 1969\u20131972 during the Apollo program and that NASA faked the information. Some conspiracy theorists believe the Skylab space station is also a hoax.(p.\u00a0162)\nThis belief is considered by the scientific community and historians to be irrational. But on the internet, the debate can occur since it is easy for anyone to publish their ideas. There are subcultures within the USA and cultures around the world that believe that the Moon landings were faked. This view is claimed to have been taught in Cuban schools and wherever else Cuban teachers are sent (Nicaragua, Angola). It is also shared by the Taliban and by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).\nHistory.\nOn 12 April 1961, the USSR sent the first man into space in Vostok 1, Yuri Gagarin. Six weeks later, US President John Kennedy promised a manned Moon landing by 1969 to win the battle of systems and impress the world with technical superiority:\nMoon conspiracy theorists say that NASA had too many technical problems to meet the eight year deadline for going to the moon. But the USA could not afford to appear lose the race to the moon to the Soviet Union, and so the moon landings were faked. In 2004, President George Bush gave not eight but sixteen years for a manned return to the Moon, even though the technologies for it should have already been developed forty years earlier. In 2010, President Barack Obama canceled this plan, which seemed to the moon conspiracy theorists to be an admission that the USA still does not have the technology to go to the moon.\nDoubts about the authenticity of the Apollo Moon landings appeared first in December 1968 when Apollo 8 was launched. The almost perfectly executed odyssey of Apollo 11 amazed many around the world, and some people doubted it was real.\nThe first book on the subject (\"Did man land on the Moon?\") was issued in Texas by the mathematician James J. Cranny in 1970.\nNASA commented on some of the conspiracy theories in June 1977. But in August 1997, their Director of Media Services (1998\u20132000) Brian Welch (1958\u20132000) said in an interview with Sky TV News:(p. 68)(48:13\u201348:46)\nWhen Fox TV aired Bruce Nash's film \"Conspiracy theory: Did we land on the Moon?\" in 2001, NASA released hoax theory rebuttal materials on their web and FTP sites. They also wrote suggestions for science teachers on how to refute the hoax claims using the Lunar Sample Disk Kits.\nIn 2002, NASA hired James Edward Oberg, to write a book intended to challenge those who claim the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax. Oberg was a former rocket scientist, MSNBC News space consultant and analyst and journalist, and, it was later discovered, a moon landing conspiracy theorist. But NASA soon cancelled the project, declining to give the reasons for this. NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said criticism that NASA was displaying poor judgement and a lack of confidence in commissioning the book caused the agency to abort it. For example, then NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said:\nIn 2006, some of the recordings of the Apollo era were declared missing. The question of what happened to the recordings was seen by conspiracy theorists as confirmation of their beliefs, and in 2009, NASA revealed that the tapes were erased.\nClaims.\nThe arguments about the moon conspiracy theories are detailed and complex. Some of the major points and counterpoints are listed below.\nComplexity.\nMoon conspiracy theorists think that NASA faked the Apollo mission with a secret program. According to James Longuski, the complexity of the conspiracy theory scenarios make them impossible. More than 400,000 people worked on the Apollo project for almost ten years, and 12 men who walked on the Moon returned to Earth to talk about their experiences. Hundreds of thousands of people would have had to keep the secret. Longuski says that it would have been a lot easier to actually land on the Moon than to create such a large conspiracy to fake it.\nPhotography and videos.\n1. In some photos, the are seemed to be partially covered by objects. Some conspiracy theorists suggest that the NASA composed the photographs by \"cutting and pasting\" objects over the background images.\n2. In some photos, the crosshairs are rotated.\n3. The letter \"C\" appears on some rocks. This is maybe a designation by the studio props.\n4. The book \"Moon Shot\" contains a fake photo of Alan Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon with another astronaut.\nEnvironment.\n1. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived solar flares when they were on their way to the Moon.\n2. During the Apollo 15 mission, David Scott did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both hit the ground at the same time.\nMissing data.\nBlueprints and drawings of the machines used in the Apollo project are missing. Some Apollo 11 tapes containing telemetry and high quality video of the first moonwalk are also missing. Moon landing conspiracy theorists believe that this is because they never existed, since the mission was faked.\nDr. David Williams (NASA archivist at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 flight director Eugene F. Kranz acknowledged that some of the Apollo 11 tapes are missing. When the recordings were sent back to Earth to be shown on TV, they were converted to a different format which was lower quality. Now the lower quality tapes are available, but the original high quality videos received in Australia are missing. Some pictures of the original high quality image are still available, and videos have been released from other missions too, like the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package.\nSome people at NASA are looking for the tapes to help them plan for future missions. They believe the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984 all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center. The tapes may have been stored rather than re-used, and efforts to determine where they were stored are ongoing. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the lunar landings.\nOn November 1, 2006 Cosmos Magazine reported that 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in the basement of the Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia. One of the old tapes was sent to NASA for analysis.\nOn July 16, 2009, NASA said that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the tape. On December 22, 2009 NASA issued a final report on the tapes. Senior engineer Dick Nafzger concluded that approximately 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and reused. For the 40th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing, Lowry Digital of Burbank, California restored the low quality videos. Some pieces of the restored footage are available on the NASA website.\nDeaths of Apollo workers.\nSome conspiracy theorists say that some astronauts were killed as part of a cover up. In a television program about the conspiracy theory, Fox Entertainment Group listed 10 astronauts and 2 others who conspiracy theorists said were killed.\nAll the deaths except for Irwin's were related to their job with NASA or the Air Force. Mike Adams and Robert Lawrence were not involved with the civilian space program. James Irwin already had several heart attacks before his death. All except two of the deaths happened at least one or two years \"before\" Apollo 11. Also, Brian Welch was speaking out \"against\" the moon hoax, so he would not have been a good target to be killed.\nAs of November 2018, four of the twelve Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 were still alive, including Buzz Aldrin. Also, nine of the twelve Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing between 1968 and 1972 are still alive, for example Michael Collins.\nDuring 1961 to 1972, at least eight Russian cosmonauts died:\nAdditionally, the chief of their spaceflight program, Sergei Korolev, died in January 1966.\ninformation of Moon landings.\nLanding sites.\nConspiracy theorists say that telescopes, for example the Hubble, should be able to take pictures of the moon where Apollo landed, and if people really did land on the moon, then the pictures should show the scars on the moon's surface and equipment it left behind. They believe that our major observatories will not take pictures of the landing sites because it would expose the cover-up.\nNASA has said that images have been taken of these landing sites, but the pictures taken by Hubble are too low quality to see very much detail. In 2009 NASA released pictures from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter showing the Apollo landing sites in more detail. These photographs have not convinced the conspiracy theorists because the pictures were taken by NASA, and they think NASA is behind the cover-up.\nTechnology.\nBart Sibrel (a conspiracy theorist) says that the Soviet Union had much more time in space than the United States before the Apollo Program. The Soviet Union put the first satellite in orbit in October 1957 named Sputnik 1. They also put the first animal in space in Sputnik 2, and were the first country to safely bring back an animal from space in Sputnik 5. Yuri Gagrin was the first man to orbit the Earth in Vostok 1, who was also from the Soviet Union. Sibrel believes that since the Soviet Union was so far ahead of the United States in the Moon race, the United States had to fake the landings to win.\nOn January 27, 1967, Apollo 1 caught fire and killed 3 astronauts. Two years later, NASA said that the problems which caused the fire were fixed. Bart Sibrel believes that the problems could not be fixed, so NASA decided to fake the landings to win the Moon race.\nNASA says that the Soviet Union's achievements were not as impressive as the United States. According to the \"Encyclopaedia Astronautica\", the US spent 1,864\u00a0hours in space, while the Soviets spent 697\u00a0hours at the completion of Soyuz 5. Apollo 7 launched in October 1968, 21 months after the Apollo 1 fire, with an astronaut on board. By Apollo 11, the Uninted States' lead was even bigger.\nBoth the United States and the Soviet Union had many problems during the Moon race. The Soviet Union had the first in-flight death in 1967, only 3 months after the Apollo 1 fire. According to NASA, most of the accomplishments first made by the Soviets were also made by the US within a year. By 1965, the US started to beat the Soviets to a few important steps. The Soviets had never developed a rocket which could land on the Moon, and they never tested landing on the Moon with an astronaut on board. \"\nMoon rocks.\nSome conspiracy theorists say that the Moon rocks collected by the Apollo Program are actually meteorites from Antarctica. Wernher von Braun, the Marshall Space Flight Center Director, and three others traveled to Antarctica in 1967 (three years before the Apollo launch) to explore for future space missions. Some conspiracy theorists believe that Braun collected meteorites during this trip to use as fake moon rocks.\nThe Apollo Program collected of moon rocks during the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 missions. According to scientists around the world, these rocks are very different from meteorites and other rocks found on Earth. The rocks are also 200,000,000 (200 million) years older than any rock found on Earth, and are similar to moon rocks later brought back by the USSR.\nSome moon rocks could have been collected without landing on the moon, but the first moon rock was found on Earth in 1979, and it was only discovered in 1982 that it came from the moon. Also, moon rocks are very rare on Earth, and only have ever been discovered, while the Apollo missions brought back 380 kilograms.\nResearch.\nIn 2004, Martin Hendry and Ken Skeldon from the University of Glasgow investigated the 'Moon Hoax'. In November 2004, they spoke at the Glasgow Science Centre and examined the top ten lines of evidence that a hoax had taken place. "}

It was famous during the years of Jacksonian democracy. It is thought to be important to the Second Party System. Operating from 1833 to 1856, the party was formed opposing the policies of President Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. The Whigs supported the importance of Congress over the importance of the executive branch. They favored a program of modernization. Their name was chosen to tell people about the American Whigs of 1776, who fought for independence. \"Whig\" was then a widely recognized label of choice for people who saw themselves as opposing autocratic rule. The Whig Party had national leaders as Daniel Webster, William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay of Kentucky. The Whig Party also had four war heroes among them, such as Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Abraham Lincoln was a Whig leader in frontier Illinois.\nIn its over two decades of existence, the Whig Party saw two of its candidates, Harrison and Taylor, elected president. Both died in office. John Tyler became president after Harrison's death, but was thrown out from the party. Millard Fillmore, who became president after Taylor's death, was the last Whig to hold the nation's highest office.\nThe party was ultimately destroyed by the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery to the territories. The anti-slavery faction successfully prevented the nomination of its own incumbent President Fillmore in the 1852 presidential election. Instead, the party nominated General Winfield Scott, who was defeated. Its leaders quit politics (as Lincoln did temporarily) or changed parties. The voter base defected to the Republican Party, various coalition parties in some states, and to the Democratic Party. By the 1856 presidential election, the party had lost its ability to maintain a national coalition of effective state parties and endorsed Millard Fillmore, now of the American Party, at its last national convention."}

The three women, Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley, were accused of practising witchcraft by a 14-year-old girl, Grace Sowerbutts. They were tried in the village of Samlesbury in Lancashire. Their trial on 19\u00a0August 1612 was one of a series of witch trials held over two days. It is among the most famous in English history. The trials were unusual for England at that time for two reasons. First, Thomas Potts, the clerk to the court, wrote about it in his \"The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster\". Secondly, the number of people found guilty and hanged were high: ten at Lancaster and another at York. Some of those accused were burnt alive and hung. \nHowever, the three Samlesbury women were found not guilty of witchcraft. \nThe women were accused of murdering children, and of cannibalism, amongst other things. In contrast, other people tried at the same time were accused of \"maleficium\", that is causing harm by witchcraft. This included the Pendle witches. The case against the three women collapsed \"spectacularly\" when the main witness, Grace Sowerbutts, was shown by the trial judge to be \"the perjuring tool of a Catholic priest\".\nMany historians, most notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, have said that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th century were a result of the religious struggles of the period. During this time, both the Catholic and Protestant Churches wanted to stamp out what they saw as heresy. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend; it has been described as \"largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda\". A trial would show that Lancashire, a wild and lawless area, was being cleared not only of witches but also of \"popish plotters\", that is, Catholics.\nBackground.\nKing James I, came to the English throne in 1603. He was influenced by the strict Scottish Reformation very much. He was very interested in witchcraft. By the early 1590s, he was convinced that Scottish witches plotted against him. His 1597 book, \"Daemonologie\", he told his followers that they must report and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. In 1604 a new witchcraft law was made, called \"An Act against Conjuration, Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits\". Anyone who caused harm by the use of magic or the exhumation of corpses for magical purposes would be given the death penalty. James was, did not believe some of the evidence presented in witch trials, he even personally showed discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.\nThe accused witches lived in Lancashire. At the end of the 16th century, the government thought this county was a wild and lawless area, \"fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people\". Since the death of Queen Mary and the coming to the throne of her half-sister Elizabeth in 1558, Catholic priests had been forced to hide, but in remote areas like Lancashire they were still able to celebrate mass in secret. In early 1612, the year of the trials, each justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to make a list of the recusants in their area\u2014those who refused to attend the services of the Church of England, which was a criminal offence at that time.\nSouthworth family.\nDuring the 16th century English Reformation, the Church of England broke away from the rule of the pope and the Catholic Church. This event split up the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family until his death in 1595, was a leading recusant. He had been arrested many times for not giving up his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did join the Church of England, for which his father disinherited him. The rest of the family stayed strictly Catholic.\nOne of the accused witches, Jane Southworth, was the widow of the disinherited son, John. Relations father and son were not polite; John Singleton, said that the father would not even go past his son's house if he could keep clear of it, and believed that Jane would probably kill her husband. Jane Southworth (born Jane Sherburne) and John were married in about 1598, and the couple lived in Samlesbury Lower Hall. John had died only a few months before her trial for witchcraft in 1612, and she had seven children.\nInvestigations.\nOn 21\u00a0March 1612, Alizon Device, who lived just outside the Lancashire village of Fence, near Pendle Hill, met John Law, a pedlar from Halifax. She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, and a few minutes later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon had to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30\u00a0March 1612. Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained, Nowell sent Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol, to be tried for \"maleficium\"\u2014causing harm by witchcraft.\nOther Lancashire magistrates learned of Nowell's discovery of witchcraft in the county. On 15\u00a0April 1612 JP Robert Holden began investigations in his own area of Samlesbury. As a result, eight individuals were sent to trial, including Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley. They were said to have used witchcraft on Grace Sowerbutts, Jennet's granddaughter and Ellen's niece.\nTrial.\nThe trial was held on 19\u00a0August 1612 before Sir Edward Bromley, a judge seeking promotion to a circuit nearer London. He may have wanted to impress King James, the head of the judiciary. Before the trial, Bromley ordered the release of five of the eight defendants from Samlesbury, with a warning about their future conduct. Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley were said to have used \"diverse devilish and wicked Arts, called Witchcrafts, Inchauntments, Charmes, and Sorceries, in and upon one Grace Sowerbutts\", to which they pleaded not guilty. Fourteen-year-old Grace was the chief prosecution witness.\nGrace was the first to give evidence. She said that both her grandmother and aunt, Jennet and Ellen Bierley, were able to change themselves into dogs and that they had \"haunted and vexed her\" for years. She also said that they had transported her to the top of a hayrick by her hair. They had also tried to make her drown herself. Grace said the women had taken her to the house of Thomas Walshman and his wife, from whom they had stolen a baby to suck its blood. Grace said the child died the next night and after its burial at Samlesbury Church, Ellen and Jennet dug up the body and took it home. The women then cooked and ate some of it and used the rest to make an ointment that let them change themselves into other shapes.\nGrace also said that her grandmother and aunt, with Jane Southworth, went to sabbats held every Thursday and Sunday night at Red Bank, on the north shore of the River Ribble. At those secret meetings they met with \"foure black things, going upright, and yet not like men in the face\", with whom they ate, danced, and had sex.\nThomas Walshman, the father of the baby allegedly killed and eaten by the accused, was the next to give evidence. He confirmed that his child had died of unknown causes at about one-year-old. He added that Grace Sowerbutts was discovered lying as if dead in his father's barn on about 15\u00a0April, and did not recover until the following day. Two other witnesses, John Singleton and William Alker, confirmed that Sir John Southworth, Jane Southworth's father-in-law, had been reluctant to pass the house where his son lived, as he believed Jane to be an \"evil woman, and a Witch\".\nExaminations.\nThomas Potts, the clerk, wrote that after hearing the evidence many of those in court were persuaded of the accused's guilt. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they \"humbly fell upon their knees with weeping tears\", and \"desired him [Bromley] for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts\". Immediately \"the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed\"; the witnesses \"began to quarrel and accuse one another\", and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson. Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue, and said she had been told what to say by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth aka Thompson, a Jesuit priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area; Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage. Leigh and Chisnal questioned the three accused women in an attempt to discover why Southworth might have fabricated evidence against them, but none could offer any reason other than that each of them \"goeth to the [Anglican] Church\".\nAfter the statements had been read out in court Bromley ordered the jury to find the defendants not guilty, stating that:\nPotts finished his book with the words: \"Thus were these poore Innocent creatures, by the great care and paines of this honourable Judge, delivered from the danger of this Conspiracie; this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open\".\n\"The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster\".\nAlmost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was told to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16\u00a0November 1612. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, and said it was \"truly reported\" and \"fit and worthy to be published\". Although written as an apparently verbatim account, the book is not a report of what was actually said at the trial, but instead a reflection on what happened. Nevertheless, Potts \"seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports\".\nIn his introduction to the trial, Potts writes; \"Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury.\" Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but he had yet to deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence \"by special order and commandment\", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his \"masterful exposure\" of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning his attention back to the remainder of the Pendle witches.\nModern interpretation.\nPotts declares that \"this Countie of Lancashire ... now may lawfully bee said to abound as much in Witches of divers kinds as Seminaries, Jesuites, and Papists\", and describes the three accused women as having once been \"obstinate Papists, and now came to Church\". The judges would certainly have been keen to be regarded by King James, the head of the judiciary, as having dealt resolutely with Catholic recusants as well as with witchcraft, the \"two big threats to Jacobean order in Lancashire\". Samlesbury Hall, the family home of the Southworths, was suspected by the authorities of being a refuge for Catholic priests, and it was under secret government surveillance for some considerable time before the trial of 1612. It may be that JP Robert Holden was at least partially motivated in his investigations by a desire to \"smoke out its Jesuit chaplain\", Christopher Southworth.\nThe English experience of witchcraft was somewhat different from the European one, with only one really mass witch hunt, that of Matthew Hopkins in East Anglia during 1645. That one incident accounted for more than 20% of the number of witches it is estimated were executed in England between the early 15th and mid-18th century, fewer than 500. The English legal system also differed significantly from the inquisitorial model used in Europe, requiring members of the public to accuse their neighbours of some crime, and for the case to be decided by a jury of their peers. English witch trials of the period \"revolved around popular beliefs, according to which the crime of witchcraft was one of\u00a0... evil-doing\", for which evidence had to be provided.\nPotts devotes several pages to a fairly detailed criticism of the evidence presented in Grace Sowerbutts' statement, giving an insight into the discrepancies which existed during the early 17th century between the Protestant establishment's view of witchcraft and the beliefs of the common people, who may have been influenced by the more continental views of Catholic priests such as Christopher Southworth. Unlike their European counterparts, the English Protestant elite believed that witches kept familiars, or companion animals, and so it was not considered credible that the Samlesbury witches had none. Grace's story of the sabbat, too, was unfamiliar to the English at that time, although belief in such secret gatherings of witches was widespread in Europe. Most demonologists of the period, including King James, held that only God could perform miracles, and that he had not given the power to go against the laws of nature to those in league with the Devil. Hence Potts dismisses Sowerbutts' claim that Jennet Bierley transformed herself into a black dog with the comment \"I would know by what means any Priest can maintain this point of Evidence\". He equally lightly dismisses Grace's account of the sabbat she claimed to have attended, where she met with \"foure black things\u00a0... not like men in the face\", with the comment that \"The Seminarie [priest] mistakes the face for the feete: For Chattox [one of the Pendle witches] and all her fellow witches agree, the Devill is cloven-footed: but Fancie [Chattox's familiar] had a very good face, and was a proper man.\"\nIt is perhaps unlikely that the accused women would have failed to draw the examining magistrate's attention to their suspicions concerning Grace Sowerbutts' motivations when first examined, only to do so at the very end of their trial when asked by the judge if they had anything to say in their defence. The trial of the Samlesbury witches in 1612 may have been \"largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda\", or even a \"show-trial\", the purpose of which was to demonstrate that Lancashire was being purged not only of witches, but also of \"popish plotters\".\nAftermath.\nBromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by King James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618, he was given responsibility for \"collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years\". Jane Southworth's eldest son, Thomas, eventually inherited his grandfather's estate of Samlesbury Hall."}

It is one of the world's greatest anti-war paintings. It is a very large painting (a mural) which shows the bombing of the Spanish town of Guernica in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.\nThe Spanish Republican government asked Pablo Picasso to paint a large mural for an art exhibition in Paris. It shows how people, as well as animals, all suffer because of the tragedies of war. The painting soon became so famous that it was seen as a world symbol for peace. The fame of the painting helped to bring the Spanish Civil War to an end.\n\"Guernica\" is navy blue, black and white, 3.5 metre (11\u00a0ft) tall and 7.8 metre (25.6\u00a0ft) wide, a mural-size canvas painted in oil. It hangs in the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid. \nDescription of the painting.\nGuernica shows a large, open room with people and animals who are suffering. A bull stands over a woman crying over a dead child in her arms. A horse falls in terrible pain as it dies after being run through with a spear. A dead soldier lies under the horse, his arm has been chopped off, but the hand grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. A light bulb shines strongly like an evil eye (the Spanish word for \"light bulb\" is \"bombilla\" which sounds like \"bomb\"). A female figure floats in, holding a lamp which is a symbol of hope. There are many other smaller details in the painting.\nHistory of the painting.\nThe painting soon travelled to many countries. It was seen in several towns in the United States during the 1940s and early 1950s. The Spanish dictator Francisco Franco wanted it to come to Spain, but Picasso said that he would not allow it to go to Spain until Spain became a democratic country. Picasso died in 1973. Franco died in 1975 and Spain became a democratic country. The painting went to Spain in 1981 and it now hangs in an art gallery, the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda, in Madrid."}

Pitcher plants catch (get) insects in a cup of liquid. The walls of the cup make nectar (sweet liquid) . The nectar attracts insects. When an insect lands on the wall, it falls down into the liquid. The insect cannot get out of the cup because the walls are smooth and slippery and the walls have hairs pointing down. \nAfter the insect is dead, its body rots. Rotting releases (lets loose) the nitrogen from the insect's body. The nitrogen then goes into the liquid and the plant takes in the nitrogen from the liquid."}

It is set in 1920s and 1980s Birmingham, Alabama and is based on a novel by Fannie Flagg called \"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe\". The movie stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary-Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson.\nPlot.\nIn Birmingham, Alabama, a woman called Evelyn goes to a nursing home to visit her mother-in-law and meets an elderly woman called Ninny. They become friends. Ninny tells Evelyn stories about when she was younger, and about the people she used to know. In particular, she tells Evelyn about two young women, Idgie and Ruth.\nIn Ninny's stories, Idgie and Ruth are friends who run a caf\u00e9 together and raise Ruth's son Buddy. Ruth has separated from her husband Frank because he used to hit her. One day, Frank goes missing and the police begin to think that Idgie has killed him.\nNinny tells Evelyn her stories over several visits. During that time, Evelyn, who was depressed, is inspired by Ruth and Idgie to have more power in her life. In the end, Ninny goes to live with Evelyn and her husband. There is a hint that Ninny and Idgie might be the same person.\nDifferences from the novel.\nThere are some differences between the movie and the novel it was made from. In the novel, Idgie and Ruth are a lesbian couple. In the movie they may be just friends. The director, John Avnet said that he wanted viewers to make up their own minds. In one part of the movie, Idgie and Ruth have a food fight. Avnet said that the food fight is symbolic of love-making. When it was released, some critics and LGBT activists were angry that the lesbian part of the story had been \"glossed over\". Even though the lesbian content had been hidden, the movie won an award from the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for best feature movie with lesbian content.\nAnother difference is that at the end of the movie, it seems possible that Ninny is really Idgie. In the novel, they are completely separate characters and are sisters-in-law.\nReception.\nThe movie was nominated for two Academy Awards and two BAFTA awards."}

A person with low blood pressure is called hypotensive.\nEverybody's blood pressure is different. Some people have naturally low blood pressure. However, for most adults, a systolic blood pressure of under 90, or a diastolic blood pressure of under 60, is low blood pressure. (Systolic is the top number in a blood pressure reading; diastolic is the bottom number.)\nSymptoms.\nLow blood pressure is not always dangerous. However, low blood pressure is dangerous if it causes any of these symptoms:\nWhat problems can low blood pressure cause?\nIf low blood pressure makes a person faint, the person could hurt themselves while falling.\nIf a person's blood pressure is very low, the heart will be unable to pump blood and oxygen to important parts of the body. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to live. Without blood and oxygen, important parts of the body, like the heart and brain, can be damaged.\nTreatment.\nFirst aid.\nIf a person's blood pressure is low enough that they are feeling dizzy, they should lay down on the ground. Putting their feet up, or bending their knees, is also helpful. This makes it easier for blood and oxygen to get to the brain (because the blood does not have to work against gravity to get up to the brain, like it would if the person were standing). Lying down will also make sure that the person does not hurt themselves by falling if they faint.\nMedical treatment.\nDoctors can treat hypotension by treating whatever is causing the low blood pressure. Sometimes, low blood pressure is caused by dehydration. This can be treated by having the patient eat more salt, drink more fluids, or (in serious cases) get fluids through a needle placed into a vein.\nIf low blood pressure is caused by medicines, doctors can change those medications to others that do not lower blood pressure as much.\nThere are also medications that increase blood pressure. They work by making it harder for blood vessels to relax. (When blood vessels relax, blood pressure goes down. If the blood vessels cannot relax as easily, blood pressure goes up.)"}

With a race condition, the result of a calculation or the behaviour of the system as a whole is dependent on how long a certain calculation takes, or when it is started. Race conditions occur in logic circuits and computer software, especially with multi-threaded or distributed systems.\nExample.\nIt is often difficult to explain what a race condition is, but the metaphor of a horse race can be used as an explanation.\nA computer program is like a horse race. The computer program does several things at the same time, similarly to how several horses run at the same time in a horse race. Each horse represents what is usually called a \"thread of execution\". That way, one such thread may handle network communication, another one may be responsible for redrawing the user interface. In the case of a race condition, the application works properly if a given horse \"wins the race\". For example, the application may work if horse number five wins, but it will crash if any other horse wins the race. One solution to the problem is to use synchronization. This is like several jockeys teaming up, to make sure horse number five is ahead. \nOn different computers, or in different situations, computers programs can run at different speeds. Sometimes, they will be faster, other times slower. This may mean that on some systems, the race condition will never show up, even though it may be easy to show it on others. Race conditions can be difficult to find. Bugs caused by race conditions are a frequent source of frustration within the profession of software development."}

It was composed to a libretto in the French language by Camille du Locle and Joseph M\u00e9ry. It was based on a famous German play called \"Don Carlos, Infante of Spain\" by Friedrich Schiller. Schiller\u2019s story is based on the true story of the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545-1568) who was promised that he could marry Elisabeth of Valois, but then his father,Philip II of Spain, changed his mind and married her himself. It was part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551-1559 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois.\nThe opera was first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Imp\u00e9rial de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra in Paris on 11 March 1867. It has five acts.\nDon Carlos was written for performance in Paris. This has made a problem for the reputation of the opera, because it was tradition in France to write very long operas. They always included a lot of ballet music as well as the singing. Verdi\u2019s opera was in five acts, and when it was performed in other countries it was too long for people\u2019s tastes, so many cuts were made, including, at first, the whole of Act I. This is a great pity, because a lot of the music in Act One is very important, with tunes which also come later in the opera. Since the beginning of the 20th century most of the music of Act I is usually performed. There have been many different versions performed, with different parts of the opera cut. When the opera is sung in Italian it is called \"Don Carlo\".\nThe story of the opera.\nThe story takes place at a time when Spain is just coming to the end of a war with France. It has been agreed between the two countries that Don Carlos, heir to the Spanish throne, will marry Elisabeth, the daughter of the King of France.\nAct I.\nDon Carlos wants to see the girl he is to marry. He goes to France and, secretly, joins a royal hunt in which Elisabeth is taking part. Elisabeth and her page are separated from the others. Carlos speaks to her and offers to take her home. The princess asks him about the prince she is to marry. Carlos says that she need not worry because the prince is kind and in love with her. He then shows Elisabeth a photo of the prince, and then Elisabeth of course realizes that it is the prince she is talking to. They sing a love duet.\nSome Spanish officials then come and tell Elisabeth that it has been decided that she is not to marry the prince: she is to marry his father, the king of Spain. The two lovers are dismayed at this news. The crowd of people beg Elisabeth to agree to marrying the King of Spain, so that the war will stop. In the end she agrees.\nAct II.\nDon Carlos has gone to a monastery so that he can be quiet in his misery. His grandfather, Charles V, had spent his last days in this monastery. A monk talks to him. Carlos thinks the monk looks like his grandfather.\nCarlos is filled with joy when his friend Rodrigue comes. He has just come back from Flanders, where there is still a lot of fighting. Carlos tells him a secret: that he is in love with Elisabeth who has now married his father and is therefore Queen of Spain. Rodrigue tells him he should spend his time helping the poor people of Flanders. The King and Queen process past the tomb.\nWhen the Queen leaves the church she goes to the garden where her ladies are waiting for her. A messenger gives her a letter from her mother in Paris, but at the same time he secretly gives her a letter from Carlos. Rodrigue quietly talks to Eboli, the queen\u2019s lady-in-waiting, while the queen reads the letters. Rodrigue asks the Queen to try to persuade the king to let Carlos talk to him. Eboli is in love with Carlos. She has noticed how Carlos has been agitated when he has been in the presence of the Queen, and thinks it is because Carlos loves her (Eboli).\nCarlos is given a chance to meet Elisabeth privately. He calmly asks her whether she could persuade the King to send him to Flanders. However, he is not really calm, and soon he starts to be angry with her for not showing any love feelings towards him. She tells him that it is her duty now that she is Queen. Carlos understands, but is still in love with her. He falls at her feet. He grabs her and declares his love for her, but the Queen tears herself from him and he rushes off in despair.\nThe Kings comes out of church. He is very cross that his wife has been left on her own. He tells the lady-in-waiting to go away. The Queen comforts her. Then she and her ladies go.\nRodrigue asks the King to stop fighting the people of Flanders who are still dying and starving from hunger. The King says they were not faithful and deserve to be punished. He tells Rodrigue that he is afraid of what is going on between Elisabeth and Carlos. He tells him to be aware of the Inquisition.\nAct III.\nA masked ball is taking place at the palace in Madrid. Carlos is waiting in the Queen\u2019s garden. A lady comes to the garden, wearing a mask, like everyone else. He thinks it is the Queen and tells her how he loves her. When the lady takes her mask off he realizes it is Eboli. She accuses him of loving the Queen. At that moment Rodrigue comes. He says to Eboli that Carlos is not well and does not understand what he is talking about. But Eboli is not deceived and plans to ruin their love affair.\nThe second scene of the act takes place in a square in Madrid. An auto-da-f\u00e9 is being prepared. During the time of the Spanish Inquisition this was a ceremony in which anyone who did not agree with the Roman Catholic church was burnt to death. Monks enter, followed by the unfortunate people who are going to be burnt. The people sing about the glories of Spain. King Philippe appears and repeats how he will fight against anyone who is an enemy of the Roman Catholic Church. Six people, including Carlos, appear and fling themselves at his feet, begging him to stop his troops from killing the Flemish people. The King will not hear of it. Some of the crowd support the king, but others are begging him to have mercy. Carlos then asks his father to allow him to rule Flanders for him. The King does not allow this, because he realizes that this could be an opportunity for Carlos and the Flemish people to rise against him. Carlos is desperate. He draws his sword and says that he will save Flanders. The crowd are terrified to see him behave like this in front of the King. The King commands his soldiers to take the sword away from Carlos, but no one obeys him. In the end, Rodrigue (who realizes that this is going to be bad for him) saves the situation by calmly asking Carlos for the sword. He hands it over and Rodrigue gives it to the King. The monks process farther, and a voice from heaven promises peace in the world to come.\nActIV.\nThe King is alone in church. In a wonderful aria he sings of his sadness that his wife does not seem to love him. The Grand Inquisitor comes in. He is very old, and blind. The King tells him about his son, and asks the Inquisitor whether Carlos should be forgiven or sentenced to death. The Inquisitor answers that it is Rodrigue who should be killed. The king dares to disagree. The Inquisitor tells the King that he is not giving his heart to God. The Inquisitor goes.\nThe Queen rushes in and asks the King to help her look for a casket of jewels which have disappeared from her room. The King shows her that it is on the table. He tells her she must open it. She does so. At the top is a portrait of Carlos. The King is very angry and accuses her of adultery. She faints. The King calles Eboli and Rodrigue for help. The King feels sorry for his suspicion, but Eboli feels even more sorry because it was she who had taken the casket because she was jealous of Carlos and Elisabeth. It was she who had suggested the King should look in the jewel case. Rodrigue feels he can only save his friend by offering himself to be killed instead of Carlos. The King and Rodrigue leave. Eboli throws herself at the feet of the Queen, who has now revived, and confesses that she herself is guilty of adultery because she had slept with the king. Elisabeth remains calm, but tells Eboli to go away from her for ever and to live in a nunnery. When Eboli is left alone she expresses her feelings of terribly misery. Before she goes to the nunnery she has one more thing to do: to try to save Carlos from being put to death.\nThe second scene of the act shows Carlos in prison. Rodrigue comes to him. He knows that Flemish letters addressed to Carlos have been found in his possession. Someone comes in and kills Rodrigue. As he dies, he tells Carlos that the Queen will wait for him the next day outside the nunnery and will see him for the last time. He dies.\nSometimes Act IV ends here, but some performances continue to show a scene in which the King tries to give the sword back to his son, but Carlos accuses him of having murdered his friend. A group of people, including Eboli, enter the prison and cry to the King to set Carlos free. The Inquisitor appears. He tells the crowd angrily that they are wicked to go against God\u2019s will. He tells them all to go down on their knees and repent.\nAct V.\nElisabeth kneels before the tomb of Charles V. She sings of her lost youth in France (some of the music from Act I comes back here). She prays for peace. Elisabeth and Carlos then meet for the last time (their third duet in the opera) and wish for happier times. The King and the Inquisitor have been hiding. They now appear and grab Carlos. The guards are told to grab him, but Carlos defends himself. Suddenly the voice of Charles V (or a monk in disguise) is heard. He takes his grandson into the safety of the cloister.\nEvaluation.\nDon Carlos is a great opera. It has some of Verdi\u2019s greatest music, especially the music of Act IV scene i, in which the events of the previous acts are all brought together. There are some wonderful duets (three duets for Carlos and Elisabeth) and some great bass arias. However, the opera is very long, but it is difficult to cut any of the singing without spoiling the drama.\nSome people feel that the end of the opera is weak. In Schiller\u2019s play there is a different ending. Carlos is handed over to the Inquisition and put to death."}

In 1492 they commanded all morisco to leave Spain. Many left, but many stayed and said they were Christians. The Inquisition became busy deciding which ones were lying. In 1502 the Muslims were also ordered out. Some parts of Spain actually enforced this order. When Protestants appeared, the Inquisition said they were just pretending to be Christians.

In 2004 she was living outside Charlottesville, Virginia.\nIn the 1960s, Brown went to the University of Florida but transferred. She moved to New York and went to New York University, where she got a degree in classics and English. Later she got another degree in cinematography from the New York School of Visual Arts. She also got a doctorate in political science from the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.\nActivism.\nIn the 1960s, Brown started to get involved in politics. She became active in the American Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war movement, the Gay Liberation movement and the feminist movement. She helped start the Student Homophile League and claims to have participated in the Stonewall riots in New York City, along with Martha Shelley. Ms. Shelley states that she was not in the bar with Ms. Brown at the time, and was simply passing by the riots, thinking they were an antiwar demonstration. Brown joined the new National Organization for Women, but left in February 1970 when Betty Friedan said anti-gay things and the organization tried to distance itself from lesbian organizations.\nIn the 1970s, she became helped start The Furies Collective, a lesbian feminist newspaper collective which said that heterosexuality was the cause of all oppression.\nShe has said, \"I don't believe in straight or gay. I really don't. I think we're all degrees of bisexual.\"\nPersonal life.\nBrown is openly lesbian and has had relationships with tennis player Martina Navratilova, actress-writer Fannie Flagg, socialite Judy Nelson, and politician Elaine Noble. Brown enjoys American fox hunting and is master of her Fox Hunt Club. She has also played polo, and started the women-only Blue Ridge Polo Club."}

It is different to fossil fuels from long dead biological material. Biofuel can be in forms of solid, liquid or gas. \nBiofuels are usually used to power cars, heat homes and for cooking. Biofuel companies are mainly from Europe, Asia and the Americas. Technologies developed at the Los Alamos National Lab even allows pollution to be converted into renewable biofuel. Agrofuels are biofuels that are produced from specific plants, rather than from waste processes such as landfill or recycled material. \nThere are two common ways to convert plants into gas and liquid fuels. One is to grow crops that are high in sugar (e.g. Sugar cane) or starch (e.g. corn), and then use yeast to ferment ethyl alcohol (ethanol). The second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil, such as palm oil, soybean and algae. When these oils are heated, their viscosity is reduced, and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine, or chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel. For thousands of years, Wood and its by-products have been converted into biofuels such as charcoal, wood gas, methanol or ethanol fuel. It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts, but this can be expensive.\nSolid biomass is also used. Firewood has been used for thousands of years. Many materials such as wood and grasses can be dried and pelletised and burnt, and this can be used to produce power."}
