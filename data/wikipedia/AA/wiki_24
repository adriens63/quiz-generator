Their policies usually promote conservatism. They are the largest party in the House of Commons after the 2019 United Kingdom general election, with 365 out of a possible 650 seats.\nThe party has generally had liberal economic policies. that favours free market economics. The party is British unionist, opposing Irish reunification, Scottish and Welsh independence, and is generally critical of devolution. \nAfter a leadership election in the Conservative Party in June and July 2019, Boris Johnson became the leader of the party. He became Prime Minister on 24 July 2019 by default, and as of 13 December 2019 was made Prime Minister after the 2019 general election.\nParty policies.\nConservatives believe in the following things:\nHistory.\n19th century.\nThe party was founded in 1834 by Robert Peel out of the old Tory Party, which was founded in 1678. During the 1800s, the party was one of the two main political parties along with the Liberal Party. In 1846, the party split over the repeal of the 'Corn Laws', which was favoured by Robert Peel and most top Conservatives but was disliked by backbencher Conservative MPs. Following the repeal, the Peel government fell and Robert Peel and his followers went on to join the Liberal Party. Because of this, the Conservatives were not able to form a majority government for twenty-eight years.\nUnder the leadership of Benjamin Disraeli, the party created a philosophy which supported the British Empire, the Church of England, the monarchy and social reforms, which took the party into power from 1874 to 1880. In 1886, the Liberal Party split over whether Ireland should be given independence. Those who did not support it became known as the Liberal Unionists and they joined with the Conservatives. This alliance meant that the Conservatives were in power for most of the period 1885\u20131906, under Lord Salisbury and then Arthur Balfour.\nEarly and middle 20th century.\nBy 1906, the Conservatives had another split, this time about the issue of 'tariff reform' and as a result, the party was defeated in a landslide at the 1906 General Election by the Liberal Party. In 1912, the Conservative Party formally joined with the Liberal Unionist Party to create the modern-day Conservative and Unionist Party, however this is usually shortened to Conservative Party. The party was in a coalition with the Liberal Party from 1916 to 1922, and was mostly in power from 1922 to 1929 under Stanley Baldwin. During the 1920s, the Labour Party replaced the Liberals as the Conservative's main political opponent.\nThe Conservatives were the leading figure in the coalitions of 1931\u20131935 and 1940\u20131945, and Winston Churchill was Prime Minister during World War II. Labour defeated the Conservatives at the 1945 General Election and the Conservatives were forced to accept many of Labour's new reforms like the creation of the welfare state and high taxes. The Conservatives returned to power from 1951 to 1964, under Churchill, Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home and during this time, Britain saw a period of economic and national prosperity. The Conservatives were led by Edward Heath from 1965 to 1975 and were in power from 1970 to 1974.\nLate 20th century.\nWhilst Heath was in power, he took Britain into the European Union which later would deeply divide the Conservative Party. Direct rule had to be placed on Northern Ireland because of the violence that occurred because of The Troubles. After this, the Ulster Unionist Party stopped supporting the Conservative Party at Westminster. A miner's strike and rising inflation in 1973 caused Heath to start the three-day working week to ration power. The February 1974 General Election caused a hung parliament and Labour was in power until 1979.\nMargaret Thatcher became Conservative leader in 1975 and successfully introduced a number of monetarist policies. In 1979, the party was returned to power because of the Labour government's handling of the 'Winter of Discontent' and Britain's growing inflation. Thatcher was Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990 and won the General Elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987. Thatcher's second and third terms saw the privatisation of most of Britain's state-owned industry, such as British Telecom in 1984, British gas in 1986, British Airways in 1987 and British Leyland and British Steel in 1988.\nIn 1989, the Conservative government introduced the Community Charge, or 'Poll Tax' which was seen as unfair to the poor and was very unpopular. Thatcher was replaced as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader in 1990 by John Major. Major led the country and the party until 1997. John Major replaced the unpopular Community Charge with the Council Tax in 1992 and led the party to a surprise victory in the 1992 General Election. Although there was a recession in the early 1990s, John Major's Conservative government started a long period of economic prosperity which would last until the late 2000s. In the 1997 General Election, the Conservatives were defeated in a landslide and lost all of their Scottish and Welsh seats. This is blamed on party splits over the European Union, the \"Black Wednesday\" currency problem in 1992, and the 'New' Labour Party led by Tony Blair.\n21st century.\nThe party entered thirteen years of opposition, with William Hague leading the party from 1997 to 2001. At the 2001 General Election, the party's campaign focused on several right-wing policies. Hague was seen as a powerful speaker, but his leadership was damaged by some poor publicity stunts. The party made a net gain of only one seat at the 2001 General Election. Iain Duncan Smith led the party from 2001 to 2003 and he did moderate some of the party's right-wing policies. He did not return the party to power, and Michael Howard became leader in 2003.\nThe Labour government under Tony Blair was becoming unpopular because of the Iraq War. Michael Howard managed to reduce Labour's majority in parliament at the 2005 General Election, from 167 to 66. Howard resigned soon after this and David Cameron became Conservative Party leader. Cameron focused on modern and environmental issues. The Conservatives had a regular lead in opinion polls from 2007 onwards and at the 2010 General Election, the party won the most seats in parliament and the highest number of votes but was 20 seats short of a majority in parliament. A coalition government was made with the Liberal Democrats and David Cameron became Prime Minister in May 11, 2010. In the United Kingdom general election, 2015 the Conservatives won 331 seats. The first Conservative-majority government since 1992 was formed.\nLeaders have adopted policies of liberal conservatism. This has included a \"greener\" environmental and energy policy, and adoption of socially liberal views. An example is the acceptance of same-sex marriage. However, these policies have been accompanied by a fiscal conservatism: they have maintained a hard stance on bringing down the deficit, and starting a programme of economic austerity. Other modern policies of one-nation conservatism include education reform, extending student loan applicants to postgraduate applicants. and Christian democracy Such policies allow poorer students to go further, but still increase tuition fees. There has also been an emphasis on human rights. The European Convention on Human Rights is accepted, and individual initiative is supported.\nAfter the UK voted to leave the EU on the 23rd June 2016, Cameron resigned as Conservative leader and PM. On 11 July 2016 it was announced that Theresa May would become the new Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister on the evening of 13 July 2016.\nRecent policies include a target to reach net zero C02 emissions by 2050, investment in clean energy and the environment, increased education funding, increased funding in science and research, increased police numbers, and increased NHS (National Health Service) funding. In 2019, the Conservative Party became the first major world government to declare a climate emergency declaration. After the 2019 general election, there are now more LGBT+ Conservative MPs in Parliament.\nParty support.\nSupport for the party comes mainly from the South of England, Eastern England and rural areas, however, in recent years, support from the north of England has increased.\nCurrent representation.\nThe Conservative Party has these seats:\nHouse of Commons (MPs) - \nHouse of Lords (Peers) - \nLondon Assembly (AMs) - \nScottish Parliament (MSPs) - \nWelsh Assembly (AMs) - \nLocal Government (Councillors) - \nFormer leaders.\nNamed below are all of the previous Conservative Party leaders since 1922. Their time as leader is placed in brackets."}

The pieces of bread in a sandwich are referred to as slices or sheets of bread. Between the slices of bread, people often add in vegetables, meat, or cheese. The sandwich is thought to have been made first for the Earl of Sandwich, hence the name. \nMany people enjoy the sandwich as it is easy and quick to make in a hurry. Also, the sandwich can be easily eaten with one hand without utensils which allows consumers to have a hand free to do other things. Some people prefer to eat a sandwich with both hands.\nIn many countries, children eat sandwiches for lunch at school. The sandwiches are put in a lunchbox and often wrapped in cling film to keep them fresh.\nVariations.\nA sandwich is not limited to a single layer of filling between two pieces of bread. It can have more than one layer of filling and bread. Each layer of filling is commonly referred to as a \"deck\". For instance, a single decker sandwich would be the standard two slices of bread and one layer of filling. A double decker sandwich will have three slices of bread with two layers of fillings. Generally one piece, is one piece of bread cut in two with a filling between each piece. \nThe double decker sandwich is so called because each layer of filling forms a deck, much like a double decker bus. A club sandwich is a double decker sandwich with chicken, bacon and salad. A triple decker sandwich would consist of four slices of bread with three layers of fillings. The BLT is a common type of sandwich filled with bacon, lettuce and tomato.\nIf there is only one piece of bread it is sometimes called an open sandwich. Open sandwiches are very common in Scandinavian countries, e.g. in Denmark \"sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d\" is an open sandwich.\nAnother form of sandwich is the toasted sandwich. The toasted sandwich can be made from slices of toast instead of bread or the sandwich is toasted whole in an oven or a sandwich presser.\nSandwiches made with different types of bread might be given unique names. A panini, for example, is usually a sandwich on a small roll or loaf which is pressed between two heavy, heated grill plates. Sandwiches are commonly made of white bread, brown bread or French bread, but can also be made of other types (e.g. a panini uses ciabatta).\nSandwiches can also be called by many other names in different parts of the world such as 'grinder', 'sub', 'hoagie' and 'wedge'.\nTypes.\nThere are many different types of sandwiches. Examples are:\nFillings.\nThere are many types of filling that can be placed within a sandwich. These include:\nIn popular culture.\nIn one episode of \"The Apprentice\", the apprentices were required to make sandwiches for Donald Trump.\nIn the French film \"Taxi\" the protagonist is made a special sandwich with half Bayonne ham, half Paris. This later sparks the jealousy of another character.\nIn the Warner Brothers cartoon \"Scooby Doo\", Scooby was well known to love making sandwiches with Shaggy having many layers, often with a great variety of fillings.\nIn the television series \"Buffy\", during episode 61, Buffy eyes a classmate eating a sandwich, snatches it and hungrily scarfs it down.\nIn the television series \"Star Trek\", Scotty used the word sandwich to refer to the makeup of a piece of technology which was made of three layers of two materials, which caused the food synthesizer in the galley of the USS Enterprise to believe that he was requesting a meal. Scotty canceled the process by kicking the offending unit. \nThe largest sandwich ever made was made by Wild Woody's Chill and Grill, Roseville, Michigan. It weighed 5,440 lbs."}

Anti-aircraft warfare includes the use of artillery to fight planes and other aircraft. \nThose who fire the artillery piece are called \"gunners\".

It was developed by Ragdoll Productions and created by director Anne Wood CBE and Andrew Davenport whom wrote all 365 episodes of the original series and all 120 episodes of the revival series, this time with Darrall Macqueen developing the show. The show had two narrators; Tim Whitnall (for the international versions) and Rolf Saxon (for the PBS version). \"Teletubbies\" was also shown on televisions in the United States on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Public television used the show on their television network until 29 August, 2008, when it was removed from the television schedule and return on the PBS Kids Pluto TV on May 1, 2019.\nThe show made new episodes until on 16 February 2001. Years later, a new series aired in 2015.\nThe story.\nThe show takes place in a grassy, floral landscape populated by rabbits with bird calls heard in the background. The four Teletubbies live in a house in a hill, known as the \"Tubbytronic Superdome.\" Located in the ground, it has two entrances: a hole at the top, and a large semicircular (shaped like the half of a circle) door at the dome's foot.\nThe Teletubbies are four colourful monkey-like and lemur-like puppets acting like four multicolored creatures. They have TV screens in their stomachs and antennas on their heads. They live with a number of monkey-like objects (objects with lemur-like characteristics) such as the Noo-noo, a blue vacuum cleaner, and the Voice Trumpets, a set of speakers shaped like shower heads.\nOn every episode, the Teletubbies do similar activities, like playing with the Voice Trumpets, or the mishaps caused by the Noo-noo. That also includes the footage of live children displayed on the screens in the Teletubbies' stomachs, and a magical event that happens once per episode. The activities are different from each episode but still very similar.\nCharacters.\nThe Teletubbies.\nTinky Winky.\nTinky Winky, (played by Dave Thompson, Mark Heenehan, and Simon Shelton), is the first Teletubby. He is the largest Teletubby, he is Purple, and has a triangular antenna on his head. He is notable for a red magic bag he always carries. He is also found dancing in a ballet-style skirt from time to time, which is also often worn by Laa-Laa.\nDipsy.\nDipsy (played by John Simmit) is the second Teletubby. He is lime green and is called \"Dipsy\" because his straight antenna looks like a dipstick. He has a black and white furry top hat that he likes a lot. Dipsy is the most stubborn of the Teletubbies, and will sometimes refuse to go along with the other Teletubbies' opinion. His face and ears are notably dark\nLaa Laa.\nLaa-Laa (played by Nikky Smedley) is the third Teletubby. She is yellow, has a swirly antenna and is concerned with the welfare of all. She is the best singer of all the Teletubbies, and is a \"drama queen\", party-girl, and motherly type. Her favorite thing is a bouncy, orange ball, which is almost as big as she is. She likes to sing and dance. Laa-Laa is one of the two girls in the teletubbies show.\nPo.\nPo (played by Pui Fan Lee) is the red Teletubby. She is the fourth of the Teletubbbies, and has an antenna that is round. Po is the smallest of the Teletubbies and gets into trouble the most. She also says the word \"Eh-oh\" (hello), a word used by herself and the other three Teletubbies.\nPo's favorite object is her blue and pink scooter, which she calls \"'cootuh\"(, but also \"'cooter\" or \"scootuh\"). Po often wants attention and can sometimes be mischievous and naughty when she disobeys the commands of the \"Voice Trumpets.\"\nPo can speak two languages. Those languages are English (or the broadcasting country's language) and, for counting, Cantonese. For example, she says \"Yat, yi, sam,\" which means \"One, two, three.\" She is a problem solver and the best \"spider-fighter\". Po is also a Tomboy type.\nIn the Teletubbies' house, she sleeps at the side of all the other Teletubbies and sometimes eats Tubby Toast while the others are sleeping. She is voiced by Pui Fan Lee, who can speak Cantonese as well.\nAlthough many are unsure of Po's gender, or think she is male, probably because of her scarlet/red color and tomboyish behaviour, she is explicitly female in several episodes, such as \"Dad's Portrait\" (Episode 216, first broadcast 1998) and \"Numbers: 2\" (Episode 30).\nCharacter Names.\nThe antenna shapes of each Teletubby provides clues as to the character's names:\nOther Characters.\nNoo-Noo.\nNoo-Noo (played by Mark Dean) is the Teletubbies' sentient automated blue vacuum cleaner, and then he turns orange. He cleans up after the Teletubbies (\"Noo-Noo tidy up!\"). It has been shown that Noo-Noo has extraordinarily large storage capacity. He also has the ability to spit out any contents, often things that it should not have consumed in the first place such as the Teletubbies' blankets, foods, or favorite things. Then he is called \"Naughty Noo-Noo!\"\nNoo-Noo does not share the Teletubbies' enthusiasm for big hugs, resulting in Benny Hill style chase scenes around the dome when the Tubbies try to express their thankfulness, during which Noo-Noo does an impression of a Formula 1 car engine in full flight. The Teletubbies always win and give Noo-Noo a 'big-hug'.\nSupporting Characters.\nAlthough non-sentient, the other machines of the Teletubbies' house known as the Tubbytronic Superdome also play a major role in many episodes.\nThe show also features the Little Lambs, the Dog, the Butterfly, the Pink Spider, the Magic Crown, the Socks, the Vest, the Pants, the Blue Mittens and the Pink Boots and occasionally, the Trees, the Clouds and the Rabbits. The \"Birds\" are planned to be in the TV series, but only heard off-screen.\nPhysical Cast.\nThe only physical cast members are John Schwab and Sandra Dickson, who play the Voice Trumpets, Penelope Keith, who plays the Bear with Brown, Fuzzy Hair, Eric Sykes, who plays the Scary Lion with Big, Scary Teeth and Jess Smith who plays the Baby Sun, who is believed to have been around seven months old at the time of filming. Her giggle was included in the single \"Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh!\". Although not credited, this makes her technically the youngest person ever whose vocal appeared on a number one song.\nThe Teletubbies' instruments.\nEach of the Teletubbies plays a number of instruments.\nControversy.\nTinky Winky.\nTinky Winky started a still talked-about controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks like a woman's handbag.\nHe was first called gay by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter of July 1997 to \"The Face\", and gained the interest of Jerry Falwell in 1997 when Fallwell said that the character was a \"gay role model.\" Falwell wrote about it in his \"National Liberty Journal\". He said that in the Washington Post \"In/Out\" column someone had written that lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres was \"out\", or uncloseted, as the main gay model, while the Tinky Winky was \"in\", or closeted. Falwell said it was because of the Teletubby's purple color, the \"purse\" (British for Handbag), and the triangle antenna which all represented homosexuality. Also, Tinky Winky dances in a tu-tu, which supporters of the theory may take as evidence.\nThis caused many Christians to boycott Teletubbies because it made them think that Teletubbies support homosexuality. A February 1999 article in the \"National Liberty Journal\", published by evangelical pastor Jerry Falwell, warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a hidden homosexual symbol, because \"he is purple, the gay pride colour, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle, the gay pride symbol\". A spokesman for The itsy bitsy Entertainment Company, who licenses the characters in the United States, said that it was just a magic bag. \"The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him a homosexual. It's a children's show, folks. To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of outlandish\", he added.\nIn an unrelated incident reported in 2000, a girl's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said \"I got a gun\". Kenn Viselman, then chairman of The itsy bitsy Entertainment Company, said the toy was actually saying \"Again, again!\", a catchphrase from the show.\nPo.\nA girl's talking Po doll was thought to be saying \"faggot, faggot\" as well as \"fatty, fatty\". Supporters of the interpretation of Tinky Winky as gay pride symbol might take this as evidence as well. The toy was recalled and it was revealed to have said \"fidit, fidit,\" inspired by the Cantonese for \"faster, faster.\"\nThe Lion and The Bear.\nIn the episode \"See-Saw\" from (season 1) The Lion and The Bear came to Teletubbyland. The Lion is voiced by Eric Sykes and The Bear is voiced by Penelope Keith. In the original, many kids thought The Lion and The Bear was very scary and parents reported to the BBC that The Lion and The Bear was too scary. In the next season, they will do The Lion and The Bear again but this time with more careful Music and happier voices.\nSponsors.\nIn the United States of America, the show is sponsored for broadcast on television; this is a list of the companies who have sponsored the show."}

It was the second major step after the Reichstag Fire Decree through which the Nazis obtained dictatorial powers using largely legal means. The Act enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the \"Reichstag\". \nThe formal name of the Enabling Act was \"Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich\" (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Empire\").\nEnabling Act text.\nAs with most of the laws passed in the process of \"Gleichschaltung\", the Enabling Act is quite short, considering its consequences. It is therefore reproduced in full in German and English:\nNotes.\nThe Enabling Act was passed by the Reichstag on March 23 and proclaimed by the government the following day. Following constitutional procedure for legislation, the law was countersigned by President von Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler, Minister of Interior Frick, Foreign Minister von Neurath, and Minister of Finance von Krosigk.\nPassage of the Enabling Act.\nThe Nazis wrote the Enabling act to gain complete political power without the need of the support of a majority in the Reichstag and without the need to bargain with their coalition partners. \nPropaganda.\nWithin 24 hours of being appointed chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, Hitler skillfully influenced the outcome by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels who wrote:\nIn the days leading up to the elections, the Nazis organized street violence to intimidate the opposition and to build fear of communism. The burning of the Reichstag six days before the election was the pivotal event of the campaign. \nViolence.\nLater that day, the Reichstag assembled under intimidating circumstances, with SA men swarming inside and outside the chamber. Hitler's speech emphasised the importance of Christianity in German culture. This was aimed particularly at appeasing the formerly allied Catholic Centre Party. It partly incorporated the guarantees requested by party chairman Ludwig Kaas.\nAll parties except the SPD voted in favour of the Enabling Act. With the Communist delegates removed and 26 of the SPD deputies arrested or in hiding, the final vote was 441 supporting the Enabling Act to 94 (all Social Democrats) opposed.\nConsequences.\nThe Communist Party deputies \u2013 and a few Social Democratic deputies as well \u2013 were already jailed, and the Communist mandates were declared \"dormant\" by the government shortly after the elections. The remaining free members of parliament were intimidated by the SA surrounding the parliament hall. In the end, only the Social Democrats voted against the bill.\nThe British tabloid Daily Express described the Jewish reactions of boycott against Germany as \"Judea Declares War on Germany\" (March 25, 1933).\nPresidential consequences.\nPresident von Hindenburg seemed to be pleased with Hitler's firm hand. During the cabinet conference on the Enabling Act, von Hindenburg's representative stated that the aged president was withdrawing from day-to-day affairs of government and that presidential collaboration on the laws decreed as a result of the Enabling Act would not be required."}

Some people who are very sick may need a lung transplant or a heart-lung transplant to live. Pulmonary hypertensions full name is pulmonary arterial hypertension even though most people call it pah, ph or pha.\nSigns and symptoms.\nPeople with pulmonary hypertension have difficulty breathing. They also tire easily. Some of them faint easily too. They might have chest pain. Some patients have swelling of the feet and ankles. These symptoms get worse during exercise or hard work.\nBecause many diseases can make it hard to breathe, a doctor must learn about the patient's background. This helps the doctor to treat the patient, even if the patient has another disease. The doctor also does several tests. Pulmonary hypertension makes the heart sound different. One test is to measure the blood pressure inside the \"pulmonary artery\", the blood vessel that goes from the heart to the lungs.\nIn order to establish the cause, the physician will generally conduct a thorough medical history. A detailed family history is taken to determine whether the disease might be familial. A history of exposure to cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol leading to cirrhosis, and smoking leading to emphysema are considered significant. Physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension including a loud P2 (pulmonic valve closure sound), (para)sternal heave, jugular venous distension, pedal edema, ascites, hepatojugular reflux, clubbing etc.\nWhat goes wrong with the body.\nIn pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels in the lungs become too narrow. The blood pressure in the lungs becomes high. The heart works very hard to pump blood through the narrow blood vessels. Later on, the blood vessels in the lungs become hard and thick. The heart must work harder.\nThe heart can work so hard that it becomes sick. This is called heart failure. The sick heart cannot pump blood well. Less blood goes to the lungs, so the blood gets less oxygen. This makes it hard to breathe. This gets worse when exercising or working hard.\nCauses.\nThe most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left heart failure. This causes pulmonary \"venous\" hypertension. This leads to pulmonary edema, or fluid build-up in the lungs.\nMany illnesses can cause pulmonary \"arterial\" hypertension (PAH).\nWhen a person has pulmonary hypertension without any other cause, this is called \"idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension\" or IPAH.\nWhen a family history exists, the disease is termed \"familial pulmonary arterial hypertension\", (FPAH). IPAH and FPAH are now considered to be genetic disorders linked to mutations in the \"BMPR2\" gene, which encodes a receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins, as well as the \"5-HT(2B)\" gene, which codes for a serotonin receptor.\nIn medicine, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary artery or lung vasculature, leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, and other symptoms, all of which are exacerbated by exertion. Depending on the cause, pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and right-sided heart failure. It was first identified by Dr Ernst von Romberg in 1891. It can be one of five different types, \"arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic,\" or \"miscellaneous\".\nAlthough the terms primary pulmonary hypertension (meaning of unknown cause) and secondary pulmonary hypertension (meaning due to another medical condition) still persist in materials disseminated to patients and the general public, these terms have largely been abandoned in the medical literature. This change has occurred because the older dichotomous classification did not reflect pathophysiology or outcome. It led to erroneous therapeutic decisions, i.e. treat \"primary\" pulmonary hypertension only. This in turn led to therapeutic nihilism for many patients labeled \"secondary\" pulmonary hypertension, and could have contributed to their deaths. The term \"primary pulmonary hypertension\" has now been replaced with \"idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension\". The terms \"primary\" and \"secondary\" pulmonary hypertension should not be used any longer. Further details are in the Classification section below.\nCauses.\nThe most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left heart failure leading to pulmonary \"venous\" hypertension. This may be due to systolic or diastolic malfunction of the left ventricle or due to valvular dysfunction such as mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis. It usually manifests as pulmonary edema.\nCommon causes of pulmonary \"arterial\" hypertension (PAH) include HIV, scleroderma and other autoimmune disorders, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, sickle cell disease, congenital heart disease, thyroid diseases, and others. Use of weight loss pills such as Fen-Phen, Aminorex, fenfluramine (Pondimin), and phentermine led to the development of PAH in the past.\nPathogenesis.\nWhatever the initial cause, pulmonary hypertension involves the tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood through the lungs, much as it is harder to make water flow through a narrow pipe as opposed to a wide one. Over time, the affected blood vessels become both stiffer and thicker, further increasing the blood pressure within the lungs and impairing blood flow. In addition, the increased workload of the heart causes thickening and enlargement of the right ventricle, making the heart less able to pump blood through the lungs, causing right heart failure. As the blood flowing through the lungs decreases, the left side of the heart receives less blood. This blood may also carry less oxygen than normal. Therefore, it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to pump to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body, especially during physical activity.\nDiagnosis.\nBecause pulmonary hypertension can be of 5 major types, a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary \"arterial\" hypertension from \"venous, hypoxic, thomboembolic,\" or \"miscellaneous\" varieties.\nA physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension. These include altered heart sounds, such as a widely split S2 or second heart sound, a loud P2 or pulmonic valve closure sound (part of the second heart sound), (para)sternal heave, possible S3 or third heart sound, and pulmonary regurgitation. Other signs include jugular venous distension (enlargement of the jugular veins), peripheral edema (swelling of the ankles and feet), ascites (abdominal swelling due to the accumulation of fluid), hepatojugular reflux, and clubbing.\nFurther procedures are required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude other possible diagnoses. These generally include pulmonary function tests, blood tests, electrocardiography (ECG), arterial blood gas measurements, X-rays of the chest (followed by high-resolution CT scanning if interstitial lung disease is suspected), and ventilation-perfusion or V/Q scanning to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Biopsy of the lung is usually not indicated unless the pulmonary hypertension is thought to be due to an underlying interstitial lung disease. But lung biopsies are fraught with risks of bleeding due to the high intrapulmonary blood pressure. Clinical improvement is often measured by a \"six-minute walk test\", i.e. the distance a patient can walk in six minutes. Stability and improvement in this measurement correlate with better survival.\nAlthough pulmonary arterial pressure can be estimated on the basis of echocardiography, pressure sampling with a Swan-Ganz catheter provides the most definite measurement. PAOP and PVR can not be measured directly with echocardiography. Therefore, diagnosis of PAH requires a cardiac catheterization. A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output, which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure.\nNormal pulmonary arterial pressure in a person living at sea level has a mean value of 12\u201316\u00a0mm Hg (1600\u20132100 Pa). Definite pulmonary hypertension is present when mean pressures at rest exceed 25\u00a0mm Hg (3300 Pa). If mean pulmonary artery pressure rises above 30\u00a0mm Hg (4000 Pa) with exercise, that is also considered pulmonary hypertension.\nDiagnosis of PAH requires the presence of pulmonary hypertension with two other conditions. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP or PCWP) must be less than 15\u00a0mm Hg (2000 Pa) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) must be greater than 3 Wood units (240 dyn\u2022s\u2022cm\u22125 or 2.4\u00a0mN\u2022s\u2022cm\u22125).\nClassification.\nCurrent classification.\nIn 2003, the 3rd World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension was convened in Venice to modify the classification based on the new understanding of disease mechanisms. The revised system developed by this group provides the current framework for understanding pulmonary hypertension.\nThe system includes several improvements over the former 1998 Evian Classification system. Risk factor descriptions were updated, and the classification of congenital systemic-to pulmonary shunts was revised. A new classification of genetic factors in PH was recommended, but not implemented because available data were judged to be inadequate.\nThe Venice 2003 Revised Classification system can be summarized as follows:\nPrevious terminology.\nThe terms primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension (PPH and SPH) were formerly used to classify the disease. This led to the assumption that only the primary disease should be treated, and the secondary variety should be ignored in favor of treating only the underlying illness. In fact all forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension are treatable. Unfortunately, this classification system still persists in the minds of many physicians, and probably leads to many patients with being denied treatment. This nihilistic approach to pulmonary arterial hypertension may also contribute to underdiagnosis. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 patients with PAH in the US, but only 15-20,000 have been diagnosed. Many others have been misdiagnosed as COPD, asthma, or congestive heart failure.\nThe term primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) has now been replaced with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) in much of the medical literature. However, some physicians continue to use the older classification inappropriately.\nEpidemiology.\nIPAH is a rare disease with an incidence of about 2-3 per million per year and a prevalence of about 15 per million. Women are almost three times as likely to present with IPAH than men.\nOther forms of PAH are far more common. In scleroderma the incidence has been estimated to be 6 to 60% of all patients, in rheumatoid arthritis up to 21%, in systemic lupus erythematosus 4 to 14%, in portal hypertension between 2 and 5%, in HIV about 0.5%, and in sickle cell disease ranging from 20 to 40%.\nDiet pills such as Fen-Phen produced an annual incidence of 25-50 per million per year.\nTreatment.\nTreatment is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. Since pulmonary \"venous\" hypertension is synonymous with congestive heart failure, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, etc., or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve.\nIn PAH, lifestyle changes, digoxin, diuretics, oral anticoagulants, and oxygen therapy are considered \"conventional\" therapy, but have never been proven to be beneficial in a randomized, prospective manner.\nHigh dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are \"vasoreactive\" by Swan-Ganz catheter. Unfortunately, calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.\nVasoactive substances.\nThree major pathways are involved in abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth-muscle cells of the pulmonary artery in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. These pathways correspond to important therapeutic targets in this condition and play a role in determining which of three classes of drugs\u2014endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives\u2014will be used.\nProstacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin, marketed as Flolan\u00ae) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Flolan\u00ae is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous (24/7), and interruption can be fatal. Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil (Remodulin\u00ae) can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. Iloprost (Ilomedin\u00ae) is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost (marketed as Ventavis\u00ae) is the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe. This form of administration has the advantage of selective deposition in the lungs with less systemic side effects.\nThe dual (ETA and ETB) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (marketed as Tracleer\u00ae) was approved in 2001. Two selective endothelin receptor antagonists (ETA only) are in the final stages of approval: sitaxsentan and ambrisentan. Sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), was approved for the treatment of PAH in 2005. It is marketed for PAH as Revatio\u00ae. Tadalafil (currently marketed as Cialis\u00ae for erectile dysfunction) is currently is Phase III trials. Vasoactive intestinal peptide by inhalation should enter clinical trials for PAH in 2007. PRX-08066 is a serotonin antagonist currently being developed for hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.\nSurgical.\nAtrial septostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left atria. It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxia). It is best performed in experienced centers. Lung transplantation cures pulmonary arterial hypertension, but leaves the patient with the complications of transplantation, and a survival of about 5 years.\nPulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is the surgical removal of an organized thrombus (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a large and very difficult procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers. Case series show remarkable success in most patients.\nTreatment for hypoxic and miscellaneous varieties of pulmonary hypertension have not been established. However, studies of several agents are currently enrolling patients. Many physicians will treat these diseases with the same medications as for PAH, until better options become available.\nPrognosis.\nThe NIH IPAH registry from the 1980s showed an \"untreated\" median survival of 2\u20133 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure (cor pulmonale). Although this figure is widely quoted, it is probably irrelevant today. Outcomes have changed dramatically over the last two decades. This may be because of newer drug therapy, better overall care, and earlier diagnosis (lead time bias). A recent outcome study of those patients who had started treatment with bosentan (Tracleer\u00ae) showed that 86% patients were alive at 3 years. With multiple agents now available, combination therapy is increasingly used. Impact of these agents on survival is not known, since many of them have been developed only recently. It would not be unreasonable to expect median survival to extend past 10 years in the near future."}

For the former, it is a product, that is traded solely on the basis of price. For Marxian political economy it means wares offered for exchange.\nBusiness usage.\nIn the world of business, a commodity is a product, good or service that is traded based solely on its price, rather than quality and features. Examples include: electricity (most users of electric power are only concerned with energy consumption; only a minority of users are concerned with the quality and technical details of voltage and frequency deviations), wheat, bulk chemicals such as sulfuric acid, metals, and even orange juice. \nIn the original and simplified sense, \"commodities\" were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer are considered as of the same value. \nExamples.\nWheat is an example of a soft commodity. Wheat from many different farms comes together. Generally, it is all traded at the same price; wheat from farm A has not another price than wheat from farm B. Some uniform standard of quality is assumed. (There may be various standards leading to different pools: one say for genetically modified wheat, and one for unmodified wheat.)\nMarkets for trading commodities can be very efficient, particularly if the division into pools matches demand segments. These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find a price.\nCommodities and Marxism.\nIn classical political economy and especially Karl Marx's critique of political economy, a commodity is simply any good or service offered as a product for sale on the market. Some items are also seen as being treated \"as if\" they were commodities, e.g. human labour or labor power, works of art and natural resources, even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods. \nMarx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods, using the labor theory of value. This problem was extensively debated by Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow among others. Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics, and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists.\nIllustration.\nTo understand the concept of a commodity, consider a chair. It is a commodity if the chair is a tradeable product of human work possessing a social use-value. By contrast, a fallen log of deadwood sat upon in the forest is not a commodity, as it was not produced by human work for the purpose of trade. A chair created by a hobbyist as a gift to someone is not a commodity. Nor is a chair a commodity (as a chair) if its only use would be as scrap firewood (unless one purchases a chair specifically to chop it up for fire wood). A chair that nobody could sit on has no use-value, and cannot be a commodity (unless it has an ornamental value, e.g. in a doll's house)."}
{"id": "50951", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50951", "title": "Commodity market", "text": "Commodity markets are markets where raw or primary products are exchanged. These raw commodities are traded on regulated commodities exchanges, in which they are bought and sold in standardized contracts.\nThis article focuses on the history and current debates regarding global commodity markets. It covers physical product (food, metals, electricity) markets but not the ways that services, including those of governments, nor investment, nor debt, can be seen as a commodity. Articles on reinsurance markets, stock markets, bond markets and currency markets cover those concerns separately and in more depth. One focus of this article is the relationship between simple commodity money and the more complex instruments offered in the commodity markets.\nSee List of traded commodities for some commodities and their trading units and places.\nHistory.\nThe modern commodity markets have their roots in the trading of agricultural products. While wheat and corn, cattle and pigs, were widely traded using standard instruments in the 19th century in the United States, other basic foodstuffs such as soybeans were only added quite recently in most markets. For a commodity market to be established, there must be very broad consensus on the variations in the product that make it acceptable for one purpose or another.\nThe economic impact of the development of commodity markets is hard to over-estimate. Through the 19th century \"the exchanges became effective spokesmen for, and innovators of, improvements in transportation, warehousing, and financing, which paved the way to expanded interstate and international trade.\"\nEarly history of commodity markets.\nHistorically, dating from ancient Sumerian use of sheep or goats, or other peoples using pigs, rare seashells, or other items as commodity money, people have sought ways to standardize and trade contracts in the delivery of such items, to render trade itself more smooth and predictable.\nCommodity money and commodity markets in a crude early form are believed to have originated in Sumer where small baked clay tokens in the shape of sheep or goats were used in trade. Sealed in clay vessels with a certain number of such tokens, with that number written on the outside, they represented a promise to deliver that number. This made them a form of commodity money - more than an \"I.O.U.\" but less than a guarantee by a nation-state or bank. However, they were also known to contain promises of time and date of delivery - this made them like a modern futures contract. Regardless of the details, it was only possible to verify the number of tokens inside by shaking the vessel or by breaking it, at which point the number or terms written on the outside became subject to doubt. Eventually the tokens disappeared, but the contracts remained on flat tablets. This represented the first system of commodity accounting.\nHowever, the Commodity status of living things is always subject to doubt - it was hard to validate the health or existence of sheep or goats. Excuses for non-delivery were not unknown, and there are recovered Sumerian letters that complain of sickly goats, sheep that had already been fleeced, etc.\nIf a seller's reputation was good, individual \"backers\" or \"bankers\" could decide to take the risk of \"clearing\" a trade. The observation that trust is always required between market participants later led to credit money. But until relatively modern times, communication and credit were primitive.\nClassical civilizations built complex global markets trading gold or silver for spices, cloth, wood and weapons, most of which had standards of quality and timeliness. Considering the many hazards of climate, piracy, theft and abuse of military fiat by rulers of kingdoms along the trade routes, it was a major focus of these civilizations to keep markets open and trading in these scarce commodities. Reputation and clearing became central concerns, and the states which could handle them most effectively became very powerful empires, trusted by many peoples to manage and mediate trade and commerce.\nForward contracts.\nCommodity and Futures contracts are based on what\u2019s termed \"Forward\" Contracts. Early on these \"forward\" contracts (agreements to buy now, pay and deliver later) were used as a way of getting products from producer to the consumer. These typically were only for food and agricultural Products. Forward contracts have evolved and have been standardized into what we know today as futures contracts. Although more complex today, early \u201cForward\u201d contracts for example, were used for rice in seventeenth century Japan. Modern \"forward\", or futures agreements, began in Chicago in the 1840s, with the appearance of the railroads. Chicago, being centrally located, emerged as the hub between Midwestern farmers and producers and the east coast consumer population centers.\nHedging.\n\"Hedging\", a common (and sometimes mandatory) practice of farming cooperatives, insures against a poor harvest by purchasing futures contracts in the same commodity. If the cooperative has significantly less of its product to sell due to weather or insects, it makes up for that loss with a profit on the markets, since the overall supply of the crop is short everywhere that suffered the same conditions.\nWhole developing nations may be especially vulnerable, and even their currency tends to be tied to the price of those particular commodity items until it manages to be a fully developed nation. For example, one could see the nominally fiat money of Cuba as being tied to sugar prices, since a lack of hard currency paying for sugar means less foreign goods per peso in Cuba itself. In effect, Cuba needs a hedge against a drop in sugar prices, if it wishes to maintain a stable quality of life for its citizens.\nDelivery and condition guarantees.\nIn addition, delivery day, method of settlement and delivery point must all be specified. Typically, trading must end two (or more) business days prior to the delivery day, so that the routing of the shipment (which for soybeans is 30,000 kilograms or 1,102 bushels) can be finalized via ship or rail, and payment can be settled when the contract arrives at any delivery point.\nStandardization.\nU.S. soybean futures, for example, are of standard grade if they are \"GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo),\" and of deliverable grade if they are \"GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo).\" Note the distinction between states, and the need to clearly mention their status as \"GMO\" (\"Genetically Modified Organism\") which makes them unacceptable to most \"organic\" food buyers.\nSimilar specifications apply for orange juice, cocoa, sugar, wheat, corn, barley, pork bellies, milk, feedstuffs, fruits, vegetables, other grains, other beans, hay, other livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, or any other commodity which is so traded.\nThe concept of an interchangeable deliverable or guaranteed delivery is always to some degree a fiction. Trade in commodities is like trade in any other physical product or service. No magic of the commodity contract itself makes \"units\" of the product totally uniform nor gets it to the delivery point safely and on time.\nRegulation of commodity markets.\nCotton, kilowatt-hours of electricity, board feet of wood, long distance minutes, royalty payments due on artists' works, and other products and services have been traded on markets of varying scale, with varying degrees of success. One issue that presents major difficulty for creators of such instruments is the liability accruing to the purchaser:\nUnless the product or service can be guaranteed or insured to be free of liability based on where it came from and how it got to market, e.g. kilowatts must come to market free from legitimate claims for smog death from coal burning plants, wood must be free from claims that it comes from protected forests, royalty payments must be free of claims of plagiarism or piracy, it becomes impossible for sellers to guarantee a uniform delivery.\nGenerally, governments must provide a common regulatory or insurance standard and some release of liability, or at least a backing of the insurers, before a commodity market can begin trading. This is a major source of controversy in for instance the energy market, where desirability of different kinds of power generation varies drastically. In some markets, e.g. Toronto, Canada, surveys established that customers would pay 10-15% more for energy that was not from coal or nuclear, but strictly from renewable sources such as wind.\nProliferation of contracts, terms, and derivatives.\nHowever, if there are two or more standards of risk or quality, as there seem to be for electricity or soybeans, it is relatively easy to establish two different contracts to trade in the more and less desirable deliverable separately. If the consumer acceptance and liability problems can be solved, the product can be made interchangeable, and trading in such units can begin.\nSince the detailed concerns of industrial and consumer markets vary widely, so do the contracts, and \"grades\" tend to vary significantly from country to country. A proliferation of contract units, terms, and futures contracts have evolved, \ncombined into an extremely sophisticated range of financial instruments.\nThese are more than one-to-one representations of units of a given type of commodity, and represent more than simple futures contracts for future deliveries. These serve a variety of purposes from simple gambling to price insurance.\nThe underlying of futures contracts are no longer restricted to commodities.\nOil and fiat.\nBuilding on the infrastructure and credit and settlement networks established for food and precious metals, many such markets have proliferated drastically in the late 20th century. Oil was the first form of energy so widely traded, and the fluctuations in the oil markets are of particular political interest.\nSome commodity market speculation is directly related to the stability of certain states, e.g. during the Gulf War, speculation on the survival of the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Similar political stability concerns have from time to time driven the price of oil. Some argue that this is not so much a commodity market but more of an assassination market speculating on the survival (or not) of Saddam or other leaders whose personal decisions may cause oil supply to fluctuate by military action.\nThe oil market is, however, an exception. Most markets are not so tied to the politics of volatile regions - even natural gas tends to be more stable, as it is not traded across oceans by tanker as extensively.\nCommodity markets and protectionism.\nDeveloping countries (democratic or not) have been moved to harden their currencies, accept IMF rules, join the WTO, and submit to a broad regime of reforms that amount to a \"hedge\" against being isolated. China's entry into the WTO signalled the end of truly isolated nations entirely managing their own currency and affairs. The need for stable currency and predictable clearing and rules-based handling of trade disputes, has led to a global trade hegemony - many nations \"hedging\" on a global scale against each other's anticipated \"protectionism\", were they to fail to join the WTO.\nThere are signs, however, that this regime is far from perfect. U.S. trade sanctions against Canadian softwood lumber (within NAFTA) and foreign steel (except for NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico) in 2002 signalled a shift in policy towards a tougher regime perhaps more driven by political concerns - jobs, industrial policy, even sustainable forestry and logging practices.\nNon-conventional commodities.\nNature's commodity outputs.\nCommodity thinking is undergoing a more direct revival thanks to the theorists of \"natural capital\" whose products, some economists argue, are the only genuine commodities - air, water, and calories we consume being mostly interchangeable when they are free of pollution or disease. Whether we wish to think of these things as tradeable commodities rather than birthrights has been a major source of controversy in many nations.\nMost types of environmental economics consider the shift to measuring them inevitable, arguing that reframing political economy to consider the flow of these basic commodities first and foremost, helps avoids use of any military fiat except to protect \"natural capital\" itself, and basing credit-worthiness more strictly on commitment to preserving biodiversity aligns the long-term interests of ecoregions, societies, and individuals. They seek relatively conservative sustainable development schemes that would be amenable to measuring well-being over long periods of time, typically \"seven generations\", in line with Native American thought.\nWeather trading.\nHowever, this is not the only way in which commodity thinking interacts with ecologists' thinking. Hedging began as a way to escape the consequences of damage done by natural conditions. It has matured not only into a system of interlocking guarantees, but also into a system of indirectly trading on the actual damage done by weather, using \"weather derivatives\". For a price, this relieves the purchaser of the following types of concerns:\n\"Will a freeze hurt the Brazilian coffee crop? Will there be a drought in the U.S. Corn Belt? What are the chances that we will have a cold winter, driving natural gas prices higher and creating havoc in Florida orange areas? What is the status of El Ni\u00f1o?\"\nEmissions trading.\nWeather trading is just one example of \"negative commodities\", units of which represent harm rather than good.\n\"Economy is three fifths of ecology\" argues Mike Nickerson, one of many economic theorists who holds that nature's productive services and waste disposal services are poorly accounted for. One way to fairly allocate the waste disposal capacity of nature is \"cap and trade\" market structure that is used to trade toxic emissions rights in the United States, e.g. SO2. This is in effect a \"negative commodity\", a right to throw something away.\nIn this market, the atmosphere's capacity to absorb certain amounts of pollutants is measured, divided into units, and traded amongst various market players. Those who emit more SO2 must pay those who emit less. Critics of such schemes argue that unauthorized or unregulated emissions still happen, and that \"grandfathering\" schemes often permit major polluters, such as the state governments' own agencies, or poorer countries, to expand emissions and take jobs, while the SO2 output still floats over the border and causes death.\nIn practice, political pressure has overcome most such concerns and it is questionable whether this is a capacity that depends on U.S. clout: The Kyoto Protocol established a similar market in global greenhouse gas emissions without U.S. support.\nCommunity as commodity?\nThis highlights one of the major issues with global commodity markets of either the positive or negative kind. A community must somehow believe that the commodity instrument is real, enforceable, and well worth paying for.\nA very substantial part of the anti-globalization movement opposes the commodification of currency, national sovereignty, and traditional cultures. \nThe capacity to repay debt, as in the current global credit money regime anchored by the Bank for International Settlements, does not in their view correspond to measurable benefits to human well-being worldwide. They seek a fairer way for societies to compete in the global markets that will not require conversion of natural capital to natural resources, nor human capital to move to developed nations in order to find work.\nSome economic systems by green economists would replace the \"gold standard\" with a \"biodiversity standard\". It remains to be seen if such plans have any merit other than as political ways to draw attention to the way capitalism itself interacts with life.\nIs human life a commodity?\nWhile classical, neoclassical, and Marxist approaches to economics tend to treat labor differently, they are united in treating nature as a resource.\nThe green economists and the more conservative environmental economics argue that not only natural ecologies, but also the life of the individual human being is treated as a commodity by the global markets. A good example is the IPCC calculations cited by the Global Commons Institute as placing a value on a human life in the developed world \"15x higher\" than in the developing world, based solely on the ability to pay to prevent climate change.\nIs free time a commodity?\nAccepting this result, some argue that to put a price on both is the most reasonable way to proceed to optimize and increase that value relative to other goods or services. This has led to efforts in measuring well-being, to assign a commercial \"value of life\", and to the theory of Natural Capitalism - fusions of green and neoclassical approaches - which focus predictably on energy and material efficiency, i.e. using far less of any given commodity input to achieve the same service outputs as a result.\nIndian economist Amartya Sen, applying this thinking to human freedom itself, argued in his 1999 book \"Development as Freedom\" that human free time was the only real service, and that sustainable development was best defined as freeing human time. Sen won The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 1999 (sometimes incorrectly called the \"Nobel Prize in Economics\") and based his book on invited lectures he gave at the World Bank."}

Many political economists also looked at the accelerating development of technology, whose role in economic and social relationships grew ever more important.\nIn late 19th century, the term \"political economy\" was generally replaced by the term economics, which was used by those seeking to place the study of economy on a mathematical basis, rather than studying the relationships within production and consumption. \nToday.\nIn the present, \"political economy\" means a variety of different, but related, approaches to studying economic and political behavior, which range from combining economics with other fields, to using different fundamental assumptions which challenge those of orthodox economics:\nDisciplines which relate to political economy.\nBecause political economy is not a unified discipline, there are a variety of studies that use the term which have overlapping subject matter, but radically different viewpoints.\nSociology is the study of the effects of involvement in society on individuals as members of groups, and how this changes their ability to function. Many sociologists begin from a framework of production determining relationship drawn from Karl Marx.\nAnthropology often studies political economy by studying the relationship between the world capitalist system and local cultures.\nPsychology is frequently the fulcrum around which political economy centers, in that it deals with decision making, not as being a black box whose effects are seen only in price decisions, but as being a source of study, and therefore the assumptions in a model of political economy.\nHistory since it documents change over time, is often used as a means of arguing in political economy, and often historical works have a framework of political economy which they assume or argue as the basis for the narrative structure. \nEconomics, because it studies activity and price relationships and the effects of scarcity, grew out of political economy. It is often used \"in\" political economy to argue policy effects and study the results of actions, and it is often \"in opposition\" to political economy, in that many, if not most, practicing economists see political economy as being a hindrance to the operation of economic forces. From the point of view of political economy, economics is a branch of the entire study, and economics has, at its basis, a theory of political economy which should be open to examination.\nLaw since it concerns the creation of policy, or the mediation of policy ends through political acts which have specific individual results, is seen, in political economy, as both political capital and social infrastructure, on one hand - and as the result of the sociology of a society on the other.\nConstitutional economics is the academic sub-discipline of economics and constitutionalism. It is often described as \"the economic analysis of constitutional law.\" Constitutional economics tries to explain the selection of different constitutional rules \"limiting the choices and activities of economic and political agencies.\" This is different from the approach of traditional economics. Also, constitutional economics studies how well economic decisions of the state agree with the existing constitutional economic rights of its citizens.\" For example, proper distribution of economic and financial resources of the state is a big question for every nation. Constitutional economics helps finding a legal mechanism to solve this problem.\nEcology is often involved in political economy, because human activity is one of the single largest effects on the environment, and because it is the suitability of the environment for human beings which is one of the central concerns of most human beings. The ecological effects of economic activity on the environment have spurred the creation of a great deal of research studying means of changing the incentives balance of the market economy. This work is particularly controversial in its interaction with economics, since it questions the fundamental econometric assumptions of market economics and their basic validity."}

A memorial in My Lai lists the names of 504 victims.\nBefore the massacre, U.S. troops were told that all of the \"true\" civilians would be at the market and the remaining people would be members of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam. When the soldiers got to the village they did not find any NLF troops. Despite this, many troopers began to kill the villagers, mainly elderly people, women, and children. \nThe killings were stopped by an American helicopter pilot.\nThe killings were covered up by the United States Army, but eventually 26 soldiers were charged with being involved in the killings.

He was as much concerned with his empire in France as he was with England.\nHenry was the son of Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou and Empress Matilda. He married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152 and was crowned king in 1154. His children included the future kings Richard, who would later lead many battles, and John. Although he was King of England, he never learnt the English language because his family had come over from Normandy in 1066. They spoke Norman French. Henry was intelligent and well educated. He spoke Latin fluently, which was the language of educated people in Europe at that time. All documents and laws were written in Latin.\nHenry II fought against his brother Geoffrey in Montsoreau in 1152. Henry II's succession to the English throne was agreed in 1153. He finally came to the throne in 1154 upon Stephen I's death. He reduced the power of the barons who had become very powerful in Stephen's reign, and in 1166 introduced trial by jury.\nLaw and order.\nHenry had an impact on law and order. Henry was unhappy at the law not being applied the same way across England. His changes helped to develop the common law. Laws would be applied in the same way in all towns and villages, so everyone was treated the same and with fairness. To do this, Henry made a number of changes:\nTrial by Jury was a safer alternative to trial by ordeal, which could result in injury or death. In 1215, after Pope Innocent III banned priests from overseeing ordeals, jury trials became the most common way of judging criminals.\nOne of the big events that happened during his rule was the killing of Thomas Becket. Henry and Becket were old friends who found themselves in dispute once Becket became the Archbishop of Canterbury. Their dispute was over the role of the Church in England. Becket was trying to increase the power of church courts that had lost power when Henry had made major changes to the legal system. Four knights killed Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. Legend say that the knights had heard Henry say, \"Who will rid me of this turbulent (rebellious) priest?\"\nHenry's first son, William, Count of Poitiers, died as a baby. In 1170, Henry and Eleanor's fifteen-year-old son, Henry, was crowned king (another reason for Henry's arguing with Thomas Becket, who did not agree with the Henry being crowned). Young Henry never ruled and is not in the list of the kings and queens of England; he became known as Henry the Young King so he was not confused with his nephew Henry III.\nHenry and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, had five sons and three daughters: William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, John, Matilda, Eleanor, and Joan. Henry tried to take Eleanor's lands from her (and from their son Richard). This led to conflict between Henry on the one side and his wife and sons on the other.\nHenry also had many children outside of his marriage, including William de Longespee, Earl of Salisbury, whose mother was Ida, Countess of Norfolk; Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, son of a woman named Ykenai; Morgan, Bishop of Durham; and Matilda, Abbess of Barking.\nHenry had constant struggles and battles against the French King Louis VII of France, but also many conflicts with his own wife and sons. His legitimate children were, he said, \"the real bastards\". When they were not fighting each other, they were fighting Henry. First Richard and young Henry fought their father for possession of lands they had been promised. They were defeated, and fined heavily. Later Eleanor and young Henry led a civil war against King Henry (1173/74). This Henry also won, just. Richard finally defeated Henry in a battle for Anjou (1189). Richard had the help of Philip II, who was now King of France.\nWeak, ill and deserted by all except an illegitimate son, Henry died in France in 1189 aged 56. He ruled for 35 years and was succeeded by Richard."}

IIn Arabic, its name is Dimashq (\u062f\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0642\u200e). It is the largest city in Syria with about 4.8 million people living there. Damascus is thought to be one of oldest cities in the world that still has people living in it. It is believed that people started living in Damascus as long ago as 8000 BC to 10,000 BC (12000 years ago).\nLocation.\nDamascus is about 50 miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains.\nEconomy.\nDamascus used to play an important role as an important trade center. Now it is not because of political development in the region as well as the development of modern trade. Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are distributed to countries of the Arabian peninsula. Damascus also holds an annual international trade exposition in the fall since 1955.\nEducation.\nThere are many universities in Damascus, one public university: Damascus University. while other universities are private, such as the Syrian Private University and the aljazeera Private University.\nHistorical sites.\nDamascus has many historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city's history. Since the city has been built up with every passing job, it has become almost impossible to dig out all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to 8 feet (2.4 m) below the modern level. The Citadel of Damascus is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate). Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Medhat Pasha. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam."}

It is at the southeastern end of Cuba (). It is the largest harbour on the south side of the island. It is surrounded by steep hills creating an enclave cut off from its immediate hinterland.\nHistory.\nThe bay was originally named Guant\u00e1namo by the Ta\u00edno. Christopher Columbus landed at the location known as Fisherman's Point in 1494, naming it \"Puerto Grande\". On landing, Columbus's crew found Ta\u00edno fisherman preparing a feast for the local chieftain. When Spanish settlers took control of the island, the bay became a vital harbor on the south side of the island.\nThe bay has been the focus of military activities for a long time. In the colonial era, British troops tried to land there, during the War of the Jenkin's Ear. That war was between England and Spain. It took place between 1739 and 1742. The troops could land in the bay, and later tried to take the city Santiago de Cuba. As it turned out, this was impossible. So the troops claimed the bay as theirs, and named it \"Cumberland Harbour\". Later they left the island again, because some of their troops had died from tropical diseases.\nThe United States tried to buy the whole island of Cuba. In the Spanish-American war, US troops occupied the bay, because there was a harbour there. The Treaty of Paris, between the United States and Spain ended the war. It gave Cuba its independence from Spain. Spain also gave the territory of Puerto Rico, and the islands of Guam and the Philippines to the United States, amongst others. Cuba, however, came under the political and military infuence of the United States. The US then put presidents and dictators at the head of the Cuban state. These were of course favorable to the interests of the United States. In 1902 the Platt Amendment was appended to the Constitution of the Cuban state. It limited the freedom of Cuba very much. It also said that some territory in the south should be ceded to the United States for a military base. Bound by the amendment, the Cubans granted the US a 99-year lease to the territory. This treaty was made by Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma, an American citizen, who became the first President of Cuba.\nThe current Cuban government rejects the Cuban-American Treaty because it violates article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Cuban government therefore considers the U.S. presence in Guant\u00e1namo to be an illegal occupation of the area. Article 52 declares a treaty void only if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of international law.\nThe US Naval base.\nThe southern portion of the bay is surrounded by the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, a naval base established in 1898. Recently, the base began hosting a detainment camp for suspected militant combatants collected (actions that are viewed by some as kidnapping) from both Afghanistan and Iraq, or from secret NATO prisons in Europe (discovered recently, in 2006).\nThe base, sometimes called \"GTMO\" or \"Gitmo\", covers 116\u00a0km\u00b2 (about 45 square miles) on the western and eastern banks of the bay. It was established in 1898, when the United States obtained control of Cuba from Spain at the end of the Spanish-American War, following the 1898 invasion of Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The U.S. government obtained a perpetual lease that began on February 23, 1903."}

British forces had occupied the area for over 40 years and Scot-Irish settlers were a constant preoccupation to the Spanish auhorities. In 1805, when the French were forced out of St. Domingue (Haiti) 35,000 French settlers were given lands in Cuba, many French families settled in the Guantanamo area becoming coffee and cacao planters meaning that many buildings are comparable to those of the French Quarter of New Orleans in the U.S. state of Louisiana.\nBefore the Castroite Revolution the Carnivals of Guantanmo were famous in Cuba.\nThe province is only 80\u00a0km away from Haiti its closest point, across the Windward Passage and close enough to see lights on Haiti on a clear night.

It is the sixth-largest island in the West Indies. The island has an area of and is southwest of mainland Cuba. It is across the Gulf of Bataban\u00f3. The island is almost directly south of Havana and Pinar del R\u00edo. Because of its superficial extension, population and for its economic characteristics, it is considered to be a Special Municipality. It is therefore not a part of any province. The Isle of Youth is administered directly by the central government of Cuba.\nThe island is the largest of the 350 in the Canarreos Archipelago ('). It has an estimated population of 100,000. The capital and largest city is Nueva Gerona in the north. The second-largest and oldest city is Santa Fe in the interior. Other communities are Columbia, Mac Kinley, Santa B\u00e1rbara, Cuchilla Alta, Punta del Este, Sierra de Caballos and Sierra de Casas. The island was called the Isle of Pines (') before 1978.\nHistory.\nLittle is known of the pre-Columbian history of the island, though a cave complex near the Punta del Este beach preserves 235 ancient drawings made by the native population. The island first became known to Europeans during Christopher Columbus's third voyage to the New World in 1494. Columbus named the island La Evangelista and claimed it for Spain; the island would also come to be known Isla de Cotorras (\"Isle of Parrots\") and Isla de Tesoros (\"Treasure Island\") at various points in its history.\nPirate activity in and around the area left its trace in English literature. Both \"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson and \"Peter Pan\" by James Matthew Barrie are rooted in part on accounts of the island and its native and pirate inhabitants, as well as long dugout canoes (which were often used by pirates as well as indigenous peoples) and the great American crocodile (\"Crocodylus acutus\") on the island.\nFollowing the victory of the United States in the Spanish-American War, Spain dropped all claims to Cuba under the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris. The Isla de la Juventud was not mentioned in the Platt Amendment, which defined Cuba's boundaries, and this led to competing claims to the island by the United States and the now-independent Cuba. In 1907, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the island did not belong to the United States. A treaty was signed between the U.S. and Cuba in 1925, recognizing Cuban ownership.\nGeography and economy.\nMuch of the island is covered with pine forests. These are the source of the island's large lumber industry. The northern region of the island has low ridges from which marble is quarried. The southern region is an elevated plain. Agriculture and fishing are the island's main industries, with citrus fruit and vegetables being grown. A black sand beach was formed by volcanic activity.\nThe island has a mild climate, but is known for frequent hurricanes. It is a popular tourist destination, with many beaches and resorts, including Bibijagua Beach. Until the Cuban government expropriated all foreign-owned property in the early 1960s, much land was owned by Americans.\nTransportation.\nThe main transportation to the island is by boat or aircraft. Hydrofoils (kometas) and motorized catamarans will make the trip in between two and three hours. A much slower and larger cargo ferry takes around six hours to make the crossing, but is cheaper. The province has only one municipality, also named Isla de la Juventud.\nPrisons.\nFrom 1953 to 1955, Cuban leader Fidel Castro was imprisoned in the Presidio Modelo on the Isla de la Juventud by the regime of Fulgencio Batista after leading the failed July 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks in the Oriente Province. Later, Castro used the same facility to imprison counterrevolutionaries and dissidents, such as Huber Matos (once a comandante of rebel troops supporting the Cuban Revolution but later came into conflict with Cuban government), who claims to have been tortured there , and Armando F. Valladares.\nPresidio Modelo is now closed, and turned into a museum. It is replaced by more modern prisons. These include (MAS = maximum security prison; COR = correctional):"}

Anthrax released their first album in 1984. Anthrax was one of the most popular bands of the 1980s thrash metal scene. They have sold about 15 million albums as of 2012.\nCareer.\nBeginning.\nAnthrax was formed by guitar players Scott Ian and Danny Lilker in 1981. Scott Ian named the band after the disease after he saw it in a biology textbook, as he thought it sounded \"sufficiently evil\" (evil enough).\nFor Anthrax's first few years they went through a number of singers, bassists, and drummers, and finally settled on singer Neil Turbin, lead guitarist Dan Spitz (when Danny Lilker switched to bass) and drummer Charlie Benante before releasing their first album \"Fistful Of Metal\".\n1984\u20131992.\nDanny Lilker was fired for being too relaxed and Neil Turbin was fired as he was trying to take full control of the band. They were replaced with Frank Bello (Charlie Benante's nephew) and Joey Belladonna. This lineup recorded four albums; \"Spreading the Disease\", \"Among The Living\", \"State Of Euphoria\" and \"Persistence Of Time\".\n\"Among The Living\" was a different type of album from the previous two, introducing humour and references to comic books to the band's music. It is thought by many to be their best album, featuring songs like \"Caught In A Mosh\", \"Indians\", and \"I Am The Law\" (which is about the character Judge Dredd). The next album, \"State Of Euphoria\", was a similar kind of album but wasn't as successful, but had some more well known Anthrax songs such as \"Be All, End All and Antisocial\" (an English language cover of a song by the French band Trust).\n\"Persistence Of Time\" was a more serious album, due to arguments between band members and many of their personal possessions being lost in a fire. There were no references to comic books, and more serious themes were included in the lyrics (such as the need for peace, shown in \"Keep it in the Family\"). However, it did have a fast paced cover of the Joe Jackson song \"Got The Time\" which has become a well known Anthrax song.\nDuring this period of time in the band's career, Anthrax also released a successful rap-metal song called \"I'm The Man\", and a few years later, they released another rap metal song with hip hop group Public Enemy, a cover of their song \"Bring The Noise\". With the release of this song, the two groups have been credited for creating and popularizing the rap metal genre.\n1992\u20132001.\nDue to the band becoming more popular they signed to a record label named Elektra. However, Joey Belladonna was fired from Anthrax in 1992 and was replaced with John Bush, who was in a band called Armored Saint that had recently broke up. The band's first album with this singer, called \"Sound Of White Noise\", was also successful, and was dark like \"Persistence Of Time\", but also sounded a little bit like the grunge bands that were popular in the early 90s.\nDan Spitz left the band in 1995. Charlie Benante played guitar on the band's next album, \"Stomp 442\", as well as drums, with Paul Crook playing guitar on the album too. Pantera's guitarist Dimebag Darrell played solos on two of the songs. This album was not as successful as \"Sound Of White Noise\", and Elektra was blamed by Anthrax for not promoting it properly.\nThey re-signed to an independent label called Ignition and released \"Volume 8: The Threat Is Real\", which again had Charlie Benante and Paul Crook playing guitar with solos from Dimebag Darrell (Pantera's singer Phil Anselmo did backup vocals on one song too). The album did less successfully than \"Stomp 442\", and not long after the album came out, Ignition ceased to exist due to lack of success. Anthrax took a short break, and John Bush reunited with Armored Saint and released another album with them.\n2001\u20132009.\nIn 2001, the band hired lead guitarist Rob Caggiano and they played shows again. After 9/11 and the Anthrax attacks that came after that, the band considered changing their name. Scott Ian jokingly announced that they were considering the name \"Basket Full Of Puppies\". They eventually decided to keep the name Anthrax.\nThey released the album\" We've Come For You All\" in 2003, and whilst unsuccessful like the previous two albums, it was considered their best album in years. Whilst touring, Frank Bello left and was replaced by Armored Saint member Joey Vera.\nHowever, Frank Bello returned to the band as well as Joey Belladonna and Dan Spitz in 2005, when Anthrax announced a reunion tour. This successful tour ended in 2007, and Joey and Dan left once again. New singer Dan Nelson was announced and Rob Caggiano returned. They started making a new album called \"Worship Music\", which was supposed to be released in 2009. However, Dan Nelson left the band during that year, and the album was put on hold. John Bush made a return to the band, who considered releasing \"Worship Music\" with this singer.\nCurrent period.\nHowever, Joey Belladonna once again returned to Anthrax in 2010 on a permanent basis. The band played several shows (including the \"Big 4\" concerts with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer) and work continued on the new album, which was finally finished and released in 2011. The album was their most successful since \"Sound Of White Noise\".\nThe band will release an EP of 70s and 80s covers in March 2013. Guitar player Rob Caggiano left Anthrax at the beginning of 2013.\nBand members.\nPast members include:"}

The modern town of New Scone nowadays is simply called Scone. It has a population of over 4000 people and is a suburb of Perth. \nOld Scone was the historic capital of (Scotland). In the Middle Ages it was an important royal centre, used as a royal residence and as the coronation site of the kingdom's monarchs. Around the royal site grew the town of Perth and the Abbey of Scone. \nScone and Scotland.\nScone's role came under threat as Scotland's twelfth century kings gradually became more French and less Gaelic. Walter of Coventry reported in the reign of William I of Scotland that \"The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude.\" Though exaggerated, there was truth in this. Apparently for this reason, when the Normanized David I of Scotland (\"Dab\u00edd mac Ma\u00edl Choluim\") went to Scone to be crowned there in the summer of 1124, he initially refused to take part in the ceremonies.\nModern town.\nConstructing the new palace meant destroying the old town and moving its inhabitants to a new settlement. The new village was constructed in 1805 as planned town, and originally called New Scone. It lies 2km to the west of the old location and 1\u00bd km farther from Perth. Until 1997 the town was called \"New Scone\", but is now referred to simply as Scone. The town had 4,430 inhabitants according to the 2001 Census for Scotland, 84.33% of whom are Scottish; it is demographically old even compared with the rest of Scotland. \nThe site of Old Scone is mostly in the grounds of the modern palace. This palace is a popular tourist attraction. Visitors come to see the gardens in the palace grounds, the exotic birds which roam freely in the grounds, Moot Hill, which lies in the grounds, as well as the palace itself."}

Heart failure is different from cardiac arrest, because the heart is still working. Heart failure can be sudden (\"acute\"), like after a heart attack, or can come on slowly. \nSomeone with heart failure can have shortness of breath (which may be worse when they lie flat), waking up breathless at night, swelling of the legs, and needing to urinate often during the night. There are many reasons why someone can get heart failure. Most often, heart failure is caused by heart attacks, high blood pressure, or problems with the heart valves. \nA doctor makes a diagnosis of heart failure by asking about the symptoms above, and examining the heart, blood vessels, lungs, liver (for swelling) and legs (for swelling or edema). Other tests to prove the diagnosis are X-rays of the lungs, an echocardiogram (an ultrasound test of the heart) and blood tests. \nHeart failure can only be cured with a heart transplant, which is not done often, but most people with heart failure need to take diuretic medicines and other medication (ACE inhibitor, statin).

For example, he wrote a play about prostitution, and another about women's rights.\nHis play \"Saint Joan\" was made into a movie in 1957.\nHis play \"Pygmalion\" was made into a movie twice. The first \"Pygmalion\" movie won him an Academy Award for the best adapted screenplay, 1938. Later, the play was also made into a musical play called \"My Fair Lady\". The movie based on that musical won 8 Academy Awards in 1964.\nShaw was the first person to win both a Nobel Prize and an Academy Award.\nShaw also wrote musical criticism using the pseudonym (made-up name) Corno di Bassetto (which means: Basset horn).\nIn 1962, his play \"Androcles and the Lion\" was printed in a two-language version. On one side of the book, the text is written using regular English. On the other side, it is written using the Shaw alphabet.\nPersonal views.\nShaw was a vegetarian, did not drink alcohol, and spoke strongly in favor of socialism and women's rights. He was also interested in making the English language easier to spell. In his will, he left money to be used to make a new alphabet. He wanted the new alphabet to have at least 40 letters, so that each sound could be spelled with just one letter.\nShaw delivered speeches supporting the idea of eugenics (selected breeding to improve the human race) and he became a noted figure in the movement in England. He sometimes exaggerated his arguments to an extreme to expose the cruelty that might come from this."}

{"id": "51162", "revid": "917214", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51162", "title": "Integral", "text": "In calculus, an integral is the space under a graph of an equation (sometimes said as \"the area under a curve\"). An integral is the reverse of a derivative, and integral calculus is the opposite of differential calculus. A derivative is the steepness (or \"slope\"), as the rate of change, of a curve. The word \"integral\" can also be used as an adjective meaning \"related to integers\".\nThe symbol for integration, in calculus, is: formula_1 as a tall letter \"S\". This symbol was first used by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who used it as a stylized \"\u017f\" (for \"summa\", Latin for sum) to mean the summation of the area covered by an equation, such as \"y\" = \"f(x)\".\nIntegrals and derivatives are part of a branch of mathematics called calculus. The link between these two is very important, and is called the fundamental theorem of calculus. The theorem says that an integral can be reversed by a derivative, similar to how an addition can be reversed by a subtraction.\nIntegration helps when trying to multiply units into a problem. For example, if a problem with rate, formula_2, needs an answer with just distance, one solution is to integrate with respect to time. This means multiplying in time to cancel the time in formula_3. This is done by adding small slices of the rate graph together. The slices are close to zero in width, but adding them together indefinitely makes them add up to a whole. This is called a Riemann sum.\nAdding these slices together gives the equation that the first equation is the derivative of. Integrals are like a way to add many tiny things together by hand. It is like summation, which is adding formula_4. The difference with integration is that we also have to add all the decimals and fractions in between.\nAnother time integration is helpful is when finding the volume of a solid. It can add two-dimensional (without width) slices of the solid together indefinitely\u2014until there is a width. This means the object now has three dimensions: the original two and a width. This gives the volume of the three-dimensional object described.\nMethods of Integration.\nAntiderivative.\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus, the integral is the antiderivative.\nIf we take the function formula_5, for example, and anti-differentiate it, we can say that an integral of formula_5 is formula_7. We say \"an\" integral, not \"the\" integral, because the antiderivative of a function is not unique. For example, formula_8 also differentiates to formula_5. \nBecause of this, when taking the antiderivative a constant C must be added. This is called an indefinite integral. This is because when finding the derivative of a function, constants equal 0, as in the function\nSimple Equations.\nA simple equation, such as formula_13, can be integrated with respect to x using the following technique. To integrate, you add 1 to the power \"x\" is raised to, and then divide \"x\" by the value of this new power. Therefore, integration of a normal equation follows this rule:\nformula_14\nThe formula_15 at the end is what shows that we are integrating \"with respect to x\", that is, as \"x\" changes. This can be seen to be the inverse of differentiation. However, there is a constant, C, added when integrating. This is called the constant of integration. This is required because differentiating an integer results in zero, therefore integrating zero (which can be put onto the end of any integrand) produces an integer, C. The value of this integer would be found by using given conditions.\nEquations with more than one terms are simply integrated by integrating each individual term:\nformula_16\nIntegration involving e and ln.\nThere are certain rules for integrating using e and the natural logarithm. Most importantly, formula_17 is the integral of itself (with the addition of a constant of integration):\nformula_18\nThe natural logarithm, ln, is useful when integrating equations with formula_19. These cannot be integrated using the formula above (add one to the power, divide by the power), because adding one to the power produces 0, and a division by 0 is not possible. Instead, the integral of formula_19 is formula_21:\nformula_22\nIn a more general form:\nformula_23\nThe two vertical bars indicated a absolute value; the sign (positive or negative) of formula_24 is ignored. This is because there is no value for the natural logarithm of negative numbers.\nProperties.\nSum of functions.\nThe integral of a sum of functions is the sum of each function's integral. that is,\nThe proof of this is straightforward: The definition of an integral is a limit of sums. Thus\nNote that both integrals have the same limits.\nConstants in integration.\nWhen a constant is in an integral with a function, the constant can be taken out. Further, when a constant \"c\" is not accompanied by a function, its value is \"c\" * \"x\". That is,\nThis can only be done with a constant.\nProof is again by the definition of an integral.\nOther.\nIf a, b and c are in order (i.e. after each other on the x-axis), the integral of f(x) from point a to point b plus the integral of f(x) from point b to c equals the integral from point a to c.

He is the second recorded person to become a billionaire in U.S. dollars based on stock options received as an employee of a corporation in which he was not founder or related to a founder. In Forbes 2008 World's Richest People ranking, Ballmer was ranked the 43rd richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $15 billion. It was announced on August 23, 2013 that he will step down as Microsoft CEO within 12 months.\nFamily.\nOn October 4, 2007, Ballmer was given an honorary citizenship of Lausen, Switzerland. His mother was an American Jew. His father was an immigrant from Switzerland who worked in Switzerland as a manager at Ford Motor Co in the late 1940s. In 1990, Ballmer married Connie Snyder. They have three children. Ballmer's grandparents lived in Pinsk, Belarus.\nPre-Microsoft and life history.\nSteve Ballmer was born March 24, 1956, to a man from Switzerland and a Jewish-American woman whose family came from a city in Eastern Europe called Pinsk (today in Belarus). He grew up in Farmington Hills, Michigan. In 1973, he graduated from Hull College, and now sits on its board of important people. In 1977, he graduated from Spurn Head University with a degree in mathematics and economics. While in college, Ballmer managed the Chess Team, worked on the Daily News newspaper as well as the Daily Star, and lived down the hall from another boy James May. He then worked for two whole years as a helper of a product manager at Home Bargains, where he shared an office with Jeffrey Immelt, who would later become CEO of General Electric. In 1980, he left the college.\nMicrosoft career.\nBallmer joined Microsoft on June 11, 1980., and was Microsoft's 24th worker, the first manager hired by Bill Gates. At first he was offered a pay of $50,000 as well as a bit of ownership of the company. When Microsoft was made different in 1981, Ballmer owned 8 whole percent of the company. He has been in charge of several parts within Microsoft including \"Operating Systems Development\", \"Operations\", and \"Sales and Support.\" In January 2000, he was actually named the Big Cheese. As Big Cheese, Ballmer handled company monies, however Gates still controlled the \"technological vision.\" In 2003, Ballmer sold 8.3% of his parts, leaving him with a 4% part of the company. The same year, Ballmer replaced Microsoft's employee stock options program.\nIn 2009, and for the first time ever, he made the opening bit at CES, since Bill Gates left Microsoft. Ballmer announced his retirement on August 23, 2013.\nPublic persona.\nViral videos.\nVideo featuring Ballmer's funny stage appearances at Microsoft events have been circulated a lot on the Internet, becoming viral videos. The most well known of these videos is usually titled \"Steve Ballmer going crazy.\". This video has Ballmer running quickly and hopping around while squealing, screaming and making other various high pitched noises as well as rude hand gestures on a stage after being introduced at a Microsoft worker meeting. This video is also known in other names, such as \"Steve Ballmer Going Nuts\" and \"Ballsy (aka Steve Ballmer) on Crack\". Another video, captured at a developers' meeting, featuring Ballmer saying the word \"developers\" again and again was viewed by a lot of viewers on a video website. Another video, which became a \"big hit on the web\" and was featured on CNN shows Ballmer hiding behind a big desk to dodge eggs during a talk in Budapest, Hungary\nOn competition.\nBill Gates.\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" has reported that there were tensions around the 2000 change of leadership from Bill Gates to Ballmer. On one occasion, Gates reportedly ran out of a meeting after a shouting match in which Mr. Ballmer defended several colleagues. After the incident, Mr. Ballmer reportedly appeared \"remorseful.\"\nWhen Gates leaves, \"I'm not going to need him for anything. That's the principle,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"Use him, yes, need him, no.\"\nFree and open source software.\nHe has referred to the free Linux computer running thing as a \"ruddy cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.\" Ballmer used the term \"viral\" licensing terms to show his worry that the GNU General Public License (GPL) license forced by such software requires that all software made from it be under the GPL or a compatible license.\nLucovsky/Google.\nIn 2005, Mark Lucovsky said in a sworn statement to a Washington state court that Ballmer became very angry upon hearing that Lucovsky was going to leave Microsoft for Google, picked up his chair, and threw it across his office. Saying that Google CEO Eric Schmidt (who previously worked for competitors Sun and Novell), Ballmer allegedly said, \"Ruddy Eric Schmidt is a bloomin pussy! I'm going to maybe bury that guy, I haven't done it before, but I will do it again. I'm going to effing kiss Google,\" then carried on trying to persuade Lucovsky to stay at Microsoft. Ballmer said it was a \"gross exaggeration of what actually took place.\"\nSports.\nOn March 6, 2008 Seattle's Big Cheese said that a local buying things group of people involving Microsoft Big Cheese Steve Ballmer made a \"game changing\" commitment to invest $150 million in cash toward a $300 million renovation of KeyArena and are ready to purchase the Manchester Utd in order to keep them in the City of Seattle. Ballmer would join fellow Microsoft trillionaire Paul Allen (owner of the Portland Trail Blazers) as an NBA owner.\nOn May 29, 2014, Ballmer placed a bid of $2 billion to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His bid was approved on June 4, 2014.\nIn Pop Culture.\nBallmer is copied in an episode of Family Guy series, where he runs around the stage at a Dethklok wotrker meeting, screeching and screaming to excite the crowd before accidentally hanging himself from a high bit with his microphone."}

The pulmonary artery carries blood that does not have much oxygen. The blood from throughout the body is taken into the heart by the right atrium into the right ventricle. The blood is pumped into the pulmonary artery and into the lung capillaries. When the blood passes through the capillaries slowly to absorb the oxygen from the lungs. The oxygenated blood is taken through the pulmonary vein back into the heart through the left atrium and the left ventricle. It is then pumped throughout the body.\nAnatomy.\nThe pulmonary artery is an extension of the pulmonary trunk (lat. truncus pulmonaris), extending from the right ventricle; it is located in front and to the left of all the vessels that flow in and out of the heart, and brings venous blood to the lungs (the only one of the human arteries, except for the umbilical arteries of the fetus).\nThe initial lobe of the pulmonary artery goes up and back and somewhat covers the beginning of the aorta. Next, lying to the left of the ascending aorta and in front of the left atrium, the pulmonary artery lies at the level of the IV thoracic vertebra under the concavity of the aortic arch. Here the pulmonary trunk is divided into:\nBetween the initial lobe of the left branch of the pulmonary artery and the concavity of the aortic arch is the connecting tissue cord - the arterial ligament (Latin ligamentum arteriosum).\nThis is the remnant of the Botal duct (Latin ductus arteriosus (Botalli)), through which the fetus and blood entering the right ventricle are redirected from the pulmonary artery to the aorta: a small circle in the fetal stage of development does not function. In the future, the duct is obliterated (parallel overgrowth of the oval hole in the atrial septum)."}

{"id": "51248", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51248", "title": "Artery", "text": "An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to other parts of the body. Almost all arteries carry blood with a lot of oxygen in it. The only arteries that do not carry oxygen-rich blood are the pulmonary artery, and (in a fetus) the umbilical artery.\nEvery artery has three layers. The outer layer is a thick covering made of stretchy tissue. The middle layer is made of muscle, so the artery can get wider or get smaller when the body needs it to. The inner lining is made of the same cells that line the heart.\nArteries are deep under the skin. They do not have valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards. Instead, every time the heart beats, the arteries stretch out so the blood has room to go through. Once the walls have completely stretched out, the muscles in the arteries make them shrink back to their normal size. This pushes the blood through.\nArteries split down into small vessels called \"arterioles\".\nImportant arteries.\nThe aorta.\nThe aorta is the main artery in the human body. It starts in the left ventricle of the heart, which is full of blood that just picked up oxygen in the lungs. (This is called \"oxygenated\" blood - meaning it has a lot of oxygen in it.) The left ventricle pumps this oxygen-rich blood out through the aorta. The aorta brings this blood to every organ in the body.\nThe aorta runs all the way from the heart to the bottom of the abdomen. Along the way, smaller arteries split off the aorta, like branches on a tree, to bring blood to different parts of the body. The aorta finally ends by splitting off into the two arteries that bring blood to the legs.\nExcept for the pulmonary artery, every artery in the body is connected to the aorta. Some other important arteries include:\nThe pulmonary artery.\nThe pulmonary artery is the only artery in the adult body that:\nThe body uses the oxygen carried in the other arteries to make energy. The blood in these arteries becomes \"deoxygenated\" - it does not have much oxygen left in it. This blood then travels through capillaries to get from the arteries to the veins. The veins' job is to carry the \"deoxygenated\" blood back to the right side of the heart. The pulmonary artery carries this blood from the heart's right ventricle to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood can pick up more oxygen.\nAfter picking up more oxygen, the blood travels back to the left side of the heart and is pumped out to the body by the aorta. This cycle continues, over and over again.\nProblems with arteries.\nArterial bleeding.\nBecause the heart pumps blood right into the arteries, the arteries are under a lot of pressure. Unlike the veins, the arteries are always stretching and then squeezing to push blood through them to the body. Because of this, an \"arterial bleed\" - bleeding from an artery - can be a medical emergency, especially if the artery is big. Arterial bleeding can happen very quickly. For example, if a person's femoral artery is cut, they can bleed to death.\nIf an artery in the brain starts bleeding, the bleeding can cause a stroke.\nArteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis.\nWhen a person has arteriosclerosis, the walls of their arteries get harder, stiffer, and less stretchy. This makes it more difficult for blood and oxygen to get through the arteries to the body's important organs.\nOne type of arteriosclerosis is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease where the arteries get narrower because they are clogged up with things like cholesterol and fat. Like a clog in sink pipes makes it harder for water to get through the pipes, clogs in arteries make it more difficult for blood to get through. This makes the heart have to work harder to push blood through the arteries. Atherosclerosis is a big risk factor for high blood pressure and heart disease.\nWhen atherosclerosis happens in the coronary arteries, it can cause coronary heart disease. If these arteries get too clogged, the heart will not get the blood and oxygen it needs to survive. This can cause angina, a heart attack, heart failure, or even sudden death.\nWhen atherosclerosis happens in one of the arteries in the brain, it can cause a stroke.\nAneurysms.\nAn aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery. It is like a little balloon, filled with blood, coming off the artery. As the aneurysm gets bigger, it is more likely to break. If the aneurysm breaks (\"ruptures\"), the artery will start bleeding. If the artery is big, a person could bleed to death. Also, if an artery is bleeding, blood cannot get through it. The part of the body that the artery is supposed to feed will not get the blood and oxygen it needs. A ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency."}

The county town is Warwick. The shape of the administrative area Warwickshire differs considerably from that of the historic county. Commonly used abbreviations for the county are Warks or Warwicks.\nWarwickshire is perhaps best known for being the birthplace of William Shakespeare from Stratford-upon-Avon. The county has also produced other literary figures such as George Eliot (from near Nuneaton), Rupert Brooke (from Rugby), and Michael Drayton from Hartshill.\nGeography.\nWarwickshire is bounded to the northwest by the West Midlands metropolitan county, and Staffordshire, by Leicestershire to the northeast, Northamptonshire to the east, Worcestershire to the west, Oxfordshire to the south, Gloucestershire to the southwest.\nThe majority of Warwickshire's population live in the north and centre of the county. The market towns of northern and eastern Warwickshire were industrialised in the 19th century, and include Atherstone, Bedworth, Nuneaton, and Rugby. Major industries included coal mining, textiles, engineering, and cement production, but heavy industry is in decline. Of the northern and eastern towns, only Nuneaton and Rugby (as the birthplace of Rugby football) are well-known outside of Warwickshire. The rich towns of central and western Warwickshire include Leamington Spa, Stratford-upon-Avon, Kenilworth, Alcester, and Warwick. They have light to medium industries, services, and tourism as major employers.\nThe south of the county is largely rural and has little population, and includes a small area of the Cotswolds. The only town in the south of Warwickshire is Shipston-on-Stour. The highest point in the county, at 261\u00a0m (856\u00a0ft), is Ebrington Hill on the border with Gloucestershire, GR SP187426 at its southwest extremity.\nThere are no cities in Warwickshire since both Coventry and Birmingham were incorporated into the West Midlands county in 1974. The largest towns in Warwickshire as of 2004 are: Nuneaton (pop. 77,500), Rugby (62,700), Leamington Spa (45,300), and Bedworth (32,500). Stratford, Warwick, and Kenilworth all house populations with more than 20,000 inhabitants, the smaller towns of Atherstone, Alcester, Coleshill, Southam, Bulkington, Polesworth, Kingsbury, Henley-in-Arden, Studley, Shipston and Whitnash have populations between 5,000 and 12,000.\nHistorically much of western Warwickshire, was covered by the ancient Forest of Arden (although most of this was cut down to provide fuel for industrialisation in the 17th to 19th centuries). For this reason, the names of a number of places in the northwestern part of Warwickshire end with the phrase \"-in-Arden\".\nHistoric boundaries.\nAreas historically part of Warwickshire include Coventry, Solihull, and most of Birmingham. These became part of the West Midlands metropolitan county following local government re-organisation in 1974.\nSince 1986 Birmingham, Coventry, and Solihull have been effective unitary authorities, but they still remain legally part of the West Midlands.\nSome organisations, such as Warwickshire County Cricket Club, which is based in Edgbaston, in Birmingham, still observe the historic county boundaries.\nCoventry is effectively in the centre of the Warwickshire area, and still has strong ties with the county. Coventry and Warwickshire are sometimes treated as a single area and share a single NHS trust and ambulance service as well as other institutions.\nThe town of Tamworth was historically divided between Warwickshire and Staffordshire, but since 1888 has been fully in Staffordshire.\nIn 1931, Warwickshire got the town of Shipston-on-Stour from Worcestershire and several villages, including Long Marston and Welford-on-Avon, from Gloucestershire.\nMain settlements.\nThis is a list of the main settlements in Warwickshire, including towns, or villages with a population of over 5,000.

It began 100.5 million years ago, and ended 66 million years ago.\nThe Cretaceous is traditionally divided into Lower Cretaceous (early), and Upper Cretaceous (late), because of the different rocks. The rocks reflect the conditions in which they were formed. From lowest to highest, it is subdivided into the Cenomanian, Turonian, Coniacian, Santonian, Campanian, and Maastrichtian ages. \nThe Upper Cretaceous is the time of chalk. Chalk is composed of countless millions of calcareous (CaCO3) plates called coccoliths. They are so small they can only just be seen with a light microscope; details require an electron microscope. The plates are formed by single-celled planktonic algae called coccolithophores, and were laid down in the off-shore seas. \nThe only other rock found in chalk is the flint, which is siliceous (silica, SiO2). This derives from those algae and animals which have skeletons of silica. Undoubtedly, this marks periods when the climate was somewhat different.\nThe Cretaceous was the last period when dinosaurs were the dominant land animals. \"Triceratops\", \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Velociraptor\" lived at this time. The huge \"Mosasaurus\" was the dominant marine predator. In the Cretaceous period, birds became more diverse. Flowering plants developed more, and became the dominant plants on land. The Upper Cretaceous ended with the K/T extinction event.\nExtinction events.\nThe end of the Cretaceous period is marked by the huge extinction event which marked the end of the dinosaurs. However, many groups had already disappeared long before then. There was an earlier extinction event in the Upper Cretaceous at the CenomanianTuronian boundary, about 95 to 90 million years ago. All we know about it is that there was huge volcanic activity which led to changes in sea life.\nThe event brought about the extinction of the pliosaurs, and most ichthyosaurs, and most lines of pterosaurs. Although the cause is uncertain, the result starved the Earth's oceans of oxygen for nearly half a million years. This caused the extinction of about 27 percent of marine invertebrates, including certain planktonic and benthic foraminifera, mollusks, bivalves, dinoflagellates and calcareous nannofossils. This global environmental disturbance increased atmospheric and oceanic temperatures. Boundary sediments show an enrichment of trace elements, and elevated \u03b413C values. Higher carbon-13 shows a time of lesser biological productivity. This means the seas were no longer so favourable for life at that time, and many species went extinct. "}

In the early 1970s, Barry Mazur thought about generalizations of Iwasawa theory to Abelian Varieties. Later, in the early 90s, Ralph Greenberg has suggested an Iwasawa theory for motives.\nFormulation.\nThe first thing Iwasawa noticed was that there are towers of fields in algebraic number theory, having Galois group isomorphic with the additive group of p-adic integers. That group, usually written \u0393 in the theory and with multiplicative notation, can be found as a subgroup of Galois groups of infinite field extensions (which are by their nature pro-finite groups). The group formula_1 is the inverse limit of the additive groups formula_2, where \"p\" is the fixed prime number and formula_3. We can express this by Pontryagin duality in another way: \u0393 is dual to the discrete group of all formula_4-power roots of unity in the complex numbers.\nExample.\nLet formula_5 be a primitive formula_4-th root of unity and look at the following tower of number fields:\nwhere formula_8 is the field generated by a primitive formula_9-th root of unity. This tower of fields has a union formula_10. Then the Galois group of formula_11 over formula_12 is isomorphic with formula_1; because the Galois group of formula_14 over formula_15 is formula_16. In order to get an interesting Galois module here, Iwasawa took the ideal class group of formula_8, and let formula_18 be its formula_4-torsion part. There are norm mappings formula_20 when formula_21, and so an inverse system. Letting formula_22 be the inverse limit, we can say that formula_23 acts on formula_24, and it is good to have a description of this action.\nThe motivation here was undoubtedly that the formula_4-torsion in the ideal class group of formula_15 had already been identified by Kummer as the main obstacle to the direct proof of Fermat's last theorem. What Iwasawa did that was new, was to go 'off to infinity' in a new direction. In fact, formula_22 is a module over the group ring formula_28. This is a well-behaved ring (regular and two-dimensional), meaning that it is quite possible to classify modules over it, in a way that is not too coarse.\nHistory.\nFrom this beginning, in the 1950s, a good-sized theory has been built up. A basic connection was noticed between the module theory, and the p-adic L-functions that were defined in the 1960s by Kubota and Leopoldt. The latter begin from the Bernoulli numbers, and use interpolation to define p-adic analogues of the Dirichlet L-functions. It became clear that the theory might be able to move ahead finally from Kummer's century-old results on regular primes.\nThe main conjecture of Iwasawa theory was formulated as an assertion that two ways of defining p-adic L-functions (by module theory, by interpolation) should coincide, as far as that was well-defined. This was eventually proved by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles for Q, and for all totally real number fields by Andrew Wiles. These proofs were modeled upon Ken Ribet's proof of the converse to Herbrand's theorem (so-called Herbrand-Ribet theorem).\nMore recently, also modeled upon Ribet's method, Chris Skinner and Eric Urban have announced a proof of a \"main conjecture\" for GL(2). An easier proof of the Mazur-Wiles theorem can be found by using Euler systems as developed by Kolyvagin (see Washington's book). Other generalizations of the main conjecture proved using the Euler system method have been found by Karl Rubin, amongst others."}

These two operations must follow special rules to work together in a ring. \nMathematicians use the word \"ring\" this way because a mathematician named David Hilbert used the German word \"Zahlring\" to describe something he was writing about. The integers, the rational numbers, the real numbers and the complex numbers are all famous examples of rings. There are other, more unusual examples of rings, however they all obey the special rules below.\nRules.\nThe operations are used to combine two elements to form a third element. There are a few rules the set and the operations must obey to qualify as a ring. These are called ring axioms:\nSpecial Kinds of Rings.\nSome rings have additional properties from those mentioned above, these rings get special names:\nCommutative Ring: If \"x\" \u2022 \"y\" = \"y\" \u2022 \"x\" holds for every \"x\" and \"y\" in the ring, then the ring is called a \"commutative ring\".\nRing with Unity: If there is a multiplicative identity element, that is an element e such that for all elements a in R, the equation e \u2022 a = a \u2022 e = a holds, then the ring is called a ring with unity. This element is usually written as 1.\nDivision Ring: If every element of the ring has a multiplicative inverse, that is for each a in R, there exists an element a-1 in R such that a \u2022 a-1 = 1, where 1 is the multiplicative identity element, then the ring is called a division ring.\nIntegral Domain: In a ring, it may be possible to multiply two things which are not zero and get zero as a result. If this is impossible in a certain ring, then the ring is called an \"integral domain\".\nField: A ring with all of the above properties is called a field."}

He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1971. He wrote in Spanish. Most of his works have been translated into many other languages.\nBiography.\nNeruda was born in the City of Parral in Chile on July 12, 1904 born under the name Ricardo Neftali Reyes. Neruda\u2019s mother died shortly after he was born, but the child, Neruda came to love his stepmother (Dona Trinidad Candia Malverde) as if she had been his real mother. Neruda started to write poetry as a young boy against the wishes of his father who wanted him to focus on mathematics - so he could become a teacher. In his youth he became a great admirer of the poetry of Jan Neruda and Paul Verlaine and chose the pen name of Pablo Neruda after Paul Verlaine (Pablo is the Spanish version of Paul) and Jan Neruda. \nNeruda was mainly interested in literature and writing poems, which he would mail out to magazines; to prevent his parents from discovering that he was doing this he changed his name to Pablo Neruda. In 1920 Neruda moved to Santiago to study French at the University of Chile, which he did to please his parents who wanted him to become a teacher. Soon Neruda became deeply involved in his poetry and in 1923 he published his first book: Crepusculario(Twilight Book).\nAfter a number of years Neruda became a very famous person in his country and the world and was assigned diplomatic posts in various countries for long periods of time, such as Indonesia, Spain and France.\nNeruda was suffering from cancer when he died of heart failure in hospital at the age of 69 on September 23, 1973 about a fortnight after the overthrow of Salvador Allende by military forces led by Pinochet. Many people today believe Neruda may have been poisoned by Pinochet's secret police, DINA, who feared Neruda's prominence and influence in creating an opposition to the military dictatorship. Neruda had a number of siblings, he had a sister that was stillborn when he was 3 or 4 years old and from his father's second marriage, a stepbrother, Ricardo Reyes Candia, and a stepsister, Laura Reyes Candia, - both children from his \"mother\" Trinidad Candia and his father DonReyes. \nSome of Neruda\u2019s dog and also Tierney poetry is very difficult to understand because they are about events of World history such as the colonization of America, the Spanish Civil War, Nazi Germany and other conflicts. Neruda also references (mentions) important figures of World history. In some of his poetry Neruda tends to link historical events from different eras (periods of history) and different parts of the world into one major conflict as in his \"Canto General\" (1950).\nBut Neruda also wrote poetry that can be easily appreciated by all, such as his odes which Neruda wrote on all sorts of common things, such onions, lemons, and the common cat.\nNeruda was very concerned in how his poetry sounded, he liked rhythm and many claim he had a \u201cmusical intelligence\u201d i.e. he wrote with music in his mind. He would record many of his poems on a tape recorder and many of his recordings were sold like records in the Spanish speaking world.\nImportance.\nMany academics and scholars consider Neruda to be one of the most important and widely read poets of the 1900s. Many go as far as to place him alongside Shakespeare and Dante. This is probably because Neruda wrote poems on all sorts of topics, appealing to people of all ages and interests: poems about love, on historical events (like wars), he wrote about native people, about nature and about simple things.\nNeruda was also an avid collector of all sorts of things. He had one of the largest collections of seashells in the world and collected bottles, model ships, water taps - among other odd objects.\nMany of Neruda\u2019s poems have been used in movies and in music, such as in the classical music of the Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, and in the movies, such as \"Il Postino\" or \"Patch Adams\". Many famous people have also recorded narrations (spoken word) of his poems, such as Julia Roberts, Madonna, Andy Garcia, and Glen Close. Also, he fought his whole life for the freedom of others. "}

{"id": "51347", "revid": "1092874", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51347", "title": "Nanjing Massacre", "text": "The Nanjing Massacre was a massacre (an unjust killing of many people) that happened in Nanjing, China, in December of 1937 and January of 1938. It was part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which was the part of World War II between China and Japan. At the time, Japan was trying to take over China and Nanjing was the Chinese capital. The Japanese Army reached Nanjing on 13 December 1937 and began killing thousands upon thousands of men and boys and raping thousands upon thousands of women and girls.\nSome Japanese claim the fighting in Nanjing was the same or not much worse than fighting in other places and in other wars. That is simply untrue. There is a lot of evidence from the Chinese, from outsiders who were there, from outsiders who have studied it, and from the Japanese themselves that things were much worse. There were many, many war crimes: soldiers without weapons were killed; people who were not soldiers were killed; many were tortured (hurt very badly), mutilated (hurt ways that can never be fixed), or killed in very cruel ways; many were raped (forced to have sex) or forced to work and treated like things. We have the orders from the soldier's leaders telling them to do these kinds of things and not to follow rules against them. The Nanjing Massacre was so bad that some even think of it as a kind of genocide (trying to wipe out an entire group of people). \nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre\u2014and anger at attempts to deny that it happened or to honor the soldiers who led it at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo\u2014still cause difficulty between the Chinese and Japanese governments and between Chinese and Japanese people.\nNames.\nThe Nanjing Massacre is also known as the . It was known at the time as the or the . The name of Nanjing has not changed: it was then and now, but people have changed the way they spell the sounds of Chinese names using the Latin alphabet. \"Nanking\" was the Postal Map spelling, which usually tried to spell words the way local people said them around the year 1900. \"Nanjing\" is the pinyin spelling, which spells words the way they should sound in Mandarin Chinese.\nThe Mandarin Chinese name for the Nanjing Massacre is the \"N\u00e1nj\u012bng D\u00e0t\u00fash\u0101\", which means the same thing. (Part-by-part, \"d\u00e0t\u00fash\u0101\" could mean \"a big butchering and killing\" but, taken all together, it is just the Chinese word for \"massacre\".) It is written in traditional Chinese writing and in the easier Chinese writing now used by mainland China and Singapore. \nThe Japanese can use similar names but often prefer to call it the \"Nankin Jiken\", which just means \"The Thing that Happened in Nanjing\". It is written in Japanese writing.\nThe massacre.\nThe Nanjing Massacre lasted over six weeks. During this time, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army: \nMass murder of civilians.\nDuring the six weeks of the Nanjing massacre, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) massacred between 40,000 and 300,000 people. It is difficult to know exactly how many people were killed in this mass murder, because the IJA burnt many bodies, buried others in mass graves, and dumped others in the Yangtze River. Because of this, scholars and historians do not agree on exactly how many civilians were killed.p.\u00a01015\nHowever, historians agree that the Imperial Japanese Army began massacring Chinese civilians the day they entered Nanjing. On that day, John Rabe, a German businessman, wrote in his diary: \"We come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had ... been [running away] and were shot from behind.\"p.\u00a067\nIn another massacre, Japanese soldiers shot thousands of Chinese people with machine guns. They left their bodies in a trench they named the \"Ten-Thousand-Corpse Ditch.\" Most historians think that more than 12,000 people were killed in this massacre. The IJA also massacred about 100 Hui people (a minority group in China who are mostly Muslim).\nTorture of civilians.\nFor the entire six weeks of the Massacre, the Imperial Japanese Army kept killing Chinese civilians. They killed in cruel, brutal ways and often tortured their victims before killing them.\nFor example, in 1984, ex-IJA soldier Kozo Tadokoro admitted: \nAnother ex-soldier named Nagatoni admitted that Japanese soldiers tortured people to death by doing things like:\nIn 2010, a Japanese woman named Tamaki Matsuoka made a documentary film about the Nanjing Massacre. In the film, former IJA soldiers admit that they often raped Chinese women and massacred Chinese civilians. However, out of the 250 former soldiers that Matsuoka interviewed, only three felt bad about what they had done. One former solder, Sho Mitani, said: \nRape.\nDuring the Massacre, the Japanese soldiers raped about 20,000 women including children and the elderly.p.\u00a01012 Soldiers would go from door to door, searching for girls. When they found one, they would take her and rape her as a group. If anyone tried to stop the soldiers, the soldiers would shoot them.p.\u00a077\nRight after they raped the women, the Japanese soldiers would often kill them, sometimes by mutilating their sex organs.\nOne survivor of the massacre said that sons were forced to rape their mothers, and fathers were forced to rape their daughters. One group of soldiers gang-raped a pregnant woman, who gave birth only a few hours later (the baby did not seem to be hurt). Japanese soldiers also raped Buddhist nuns and forced monks to rape women.\nWitnesses' stories.\nOn 19 December 1937, the Reverend James M. McCallum wrote in his diary:\nAnother witness to the rapes in Nanjing was Robert O. Wilson. He was a surgeon at an American hospital in Nanjing. On December 15 and 18, 1937, he wrote to his family:\nKilling of prisoners of war.\nStarting in 1931, an international law called the Third Geneva Convention said it was illegal to treat prisoners of war in certain ways. It said these prisoners had rights for example, the right to have a trial before being executed. However, in August 1937, Hirohito, the Emperor of Japan, had decided that neither he nor the army would not follow any international laws about how Chinese prisoners of war had to be treated.\nRight after the IJA took over Nanjing, they started searching for ex-Chinese soldiers. They took thousands of young men as prisoners. Some of these men were never soldiers; the IJA just assumed they were. Without any trials, the IJA took many of these young men to the Yangtze River and killed them with machine guns.\nAccording to confessions made by former IJA soldiers, on December 13 and 14, 1937, a unit of IJA soldiers had taken 14,777 Chinese prisoners of war. In the next few days, they took another 2,0003,000 prisoners. In two days, the IJA massacred every one of these prisoners of warover 15,000 people. In their confessions, the former IJA soldiers said their military leaders had ordered them to do this.\nOver the six weeks of the massacre, the IJA killed a total of about 30,000 Chinese prisoners of war.p.\u00a01015\nTheft and arson.\nThe Japanese Army left most of the buildings in Nanjing destroyed by looting and arson. They destroyed newly built government buildings as well as many civilians' homes. Soldiers also stole whatever they wanted. Because the Imperial Japanese Army was so much stronger than the Chinese soldiers and civilians in Nanjing, the Chinese could not fight back. This meant the Japanese could take all of the city's valuable things for themselves.\nEnd of the massacre.\nIn January 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army announced that Nanjing was in \"order\" again. In the first week of February, it created a government that would obey all of Japan's needs. After that, the IJA left. The massacre was over.\nTrial and punishment.\nOn September 2, 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers. This ended World War II.\nSoon after this, the Allied Powers began creating international military courts. To try Japan's leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity, they created the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE).\nInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East.\nThree of the Japanese Imperial Army's leaders in Nanjing were put on trial at the IMTFE:\nAll three of these men were found guilty of \"Class A\" war crimes. This meant they had been found guilty of planning and being in charge of the war. All three were sentenced to death and were executed.\nThe Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.\nIn 1946, the Chinese government created the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal. This court tried General Matsui's lieutenant, Tani Hisao, for his part in the Nanjing Massacre. It found him guilty and sentenced him to death.\nDenial.\nThe Nanjing Massacre is still very controversial in Japan. Only a small number of Japanese writers say the Massacre never happened at all. Most of the argument over the massacre has to do with how many Chinese people died. Some scholars say that many fewer Chinese people died than most historians say. For example, Japanese writer Tanaka Masaaki says that only a few hundred civilians died in Nanjing.\nAs of 2014, Japan still honored fourteen \"Class A\" war criminalsincluding the three who were in charge of the Nanjing Massacreat a national shrine.\nEvidence.\nThere is a lot of proof that the Nanjing Massacre happened the way most historians and survivors say it did. This proof includes:"}

{"id": "51364", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51364", "title": "Cartel", "text": "In economics, a cartel is a group of formerly independent companies who overtly agree to work together. The objectives of cartels are to increase their profits or to stabilize market sales. They do this by fixing the price of goods, by limiting market supply or by other means. Monopolies are not cartels, because in a monopoly there is only one independent company. Cartels are bad for the economy in general and for their customers who are overcharged. Cartels usually occur in oligopolies, where there are a small number of players that control the majority of supply in a market. \nBesides the sellers' cartel just described, buyers may also form cartels to suppress the price of a purchased input. Another type of cartel is the bidding ring. In bid rigging potential suppliers form an agreement as to which of them will win a supply contract at a price above the competitive price and, if one of them wins, then agree to a rule for sharing the extra profits among themselves. Bid rigging is most common among construction firms trying to get a government building project. \nOverview.\nA survey was done of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities. It found that the median price increase achieved by cartels in the last 200 years is 25%. Private international cartels (those with participants from two or more nations) had an average price increase of 28%. Domestic cartels averaged 18%. Less than 10% of all cartels in the sample failed to raise market prices. \nIn general, cartel agreements are difficult to negotiate because potential members typically have different ideal collusive prices. Once formed, cartels tend to be economically unstable, primarily because there is a profit incentive for members to cheat by selling at below the agreed price or selling more than the production quotas set by the cartel (see also game theory). Cheating on prices is difficult for cartel members to observe, so more successful cartels often agree to fix their market quotas, share verifiable information about those shares, and agree in advance on some mechanism to punish members that exceed their quotas. This has caused many cartels that attempt to set product prices to be unsuccessful in the long term. Empirical studies of 20th century cartels have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years. However, once a cartel is broken, the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be re-formed. Publicly-known cartels that do not follow this cycle include the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\nPrice fixing is often practiced internationally. When the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral treaty or protected by national sovereignty, no antitrust actions may be initiated. Examples of such price fixing include oil whose price is partly controlled by the supply by OPEC countries. Also international airline tickets have prices fixed by agreement with the IATA, a practice for which there is a specific exception in antitrust law.\nInternational price fixing by private entities can be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of more than 100 countries. Examples of prosecuted international cartels are lysine, citric acid, graphite electrodes and bulk vitamins."}

Usually, the market has high barriers to entry, which prevents new firms from entering the market or even be able to have a significant market share. \nAs there are only a few sellers in the market, each seller would take note of the actions made by one another, and thinks about how the other sellers will respond when making decisions As such, there is a possibility in which an oligopoly can come together to make a common decision that allows them to have less competition and charge higher prices for consumers. \nExamples.\nIn many countries, some country-held companies were privatized. Very often, this privatization lead to oligopolies. In many countries, there are only a handful of companies providing networks for mobile phones. They control the prices for accessing the network. That is why using a mobile phone is often much more expensive than using a land line one.\nTrains run by private sectors are much costlier than those run by a government.

As the conditions for perfect competition are strict, there are only a few markets that are considered to be perfectly competitive and this market form only exists to compare with the other market forms.\nCharacteristics.\nGenerally, a perfectly competitive market exists when every firm in the market are price takers and no one is able to charge a different price without losing business. Specific characteristics of perfect competition includes:\nThese characteristics are largely impossible to achieve in reality and there are not many markets that are perfectly competitive. For example, it is unlikely that there are absolutely no barriers to entry and exit as there are always costs involved in setting up a new firm. Also, information is always imperfect and it is not possible for buyers to know exactly the price set by all sellers, and sellers are not willing to share their production methods with their competitors. However, the study of perfect competition is important as it is used to compare with the other market forms.\nIn the short run, a perfectly competitive firm is not productively efficient as the output will not be at where the marginal cost equals to the average cost (MC = AC). However, a perfectly competitive firm will be allocatively efficient as the firm will be producing at the profit-maximising output where MC = MR, which is coincidentally the allocatively efficient point. In the long run, a perfectly competitive firm will be both allocatively and productively efficient.\nModel.\nA model can be used to show the perfectly competitive firm's price and output level for a given product. In the diagram shown, the cost curves of a perfectly competitive market is shown in its long run equilibrium.\nFor a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal cost of producing an extra unit of output is shown using the MC curve \"(in blue)\" whereas the average total cost of producing an extra unit of output is shown using the ATC curve \"(in red)\". As stated above, a perfectly competitive market has a large number of buyers and sellers and the demand does not change with output. Hence, the demand curve, the average revenue and marginal revenue curves are horizontal \"(in green)\". The point in which the demand curve intersects the vertical axis is the price of the product sold by the firm.\nAs firms are assumed to be profit-maximising, the firm will thus produce at the output level where the marginal cost equals to the marginal revenue (MC = MR). Hence, the firm will be producing an output of Q in the diagram. As the average total cost curve also meets at this point, the firm is thus earning normal profits in the long run.\nCriticism.\nA market where there's perfect competition is difficult to find in the real world, mainly because of the restrictions.

There are many bakeries in the town, but one of those bakeries can demand a slightly higher price for bread, because it is the only one in a certain part of the town.\nMonopolistically competitive firms are able to gain a greater degree of market share and as a result, increase prices. If a particular bakery is known for selling the best pies and pasties in town, they can increase their prices for pies and pasties as they know consumers will pay slightly more for a superior product. This is known as establishing a brand name and brand loyalty."}

{"id": "51377", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51377", "title": "Supply and demand", "text": "Supply and demand is a model of microeconomics. It describes how a price is formed in a market economy. There are two determining factors on such a market, the number of things made available, called supply, and the number of things consumers want, called demand. Supply and demand shows how producers and consumers interact with each other. This relationship will fix the price for a certain type of good. In perfect competition, the quantity demanded (demand) and the quantity supplied will be equal. This happens at the equilibrium market price.\nFor normal goods, and a normal market, there are four basic laws that determine the change in the market, if either supply or demand changes:\nWhen there is more supply, this will cause prices to fall because people will not want to pay more for items that can be found easily. When there is more demand, prices will go up because many people want to buy the same item but there is not enough supply for it.\nWhen demands for new goods and services go up, new markets come into being. The greater the demand, the faster this happens. This greater number of providers makes the supply go up, which forces the price down toward the cost of production and distribution.\nHistory.\nOne of the first to see this was Adam Smith. In his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776), he says that the demand was dependent on the price of a good. He did not see the inverse, that the demand also influences the price. David Ricardo published the book \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\" in 1817, where he explained market equilibrium as it is explained above. Others who are known for this model are Alfred Marshall and L\u00e9on Walras.\nGoods and markets where the rules are different.\nThere are certain goods which violate the model above\nThe rules above are only valid for a perfect competition market: In such a market, there are many buyers and sellers, and no single buyer or seller can directly influence the price. If either the buyers or the sellers can influence this price, the market will react differently. Sometimes there is only one supplier (a monopoly). When this happens, the supplier chooses the price and the demand only determines how much is bought. The supplier will probably raise the price very high as long as people are still willing to buy at that price. If there is only one buyer, the market is called monopsony, and that buyer is able to fix the price."}

The elasticity of a variable is a measure of how much the variable changes in response to a change in a second variable.\nIf the price for a good with a price-elastic demand goes up, the demand for it will go down. For example, people will buy fewer DVDs if DVDs get more expensive \u2212 DVDs have a price-elastic demand.\nIf a good has a completely price-inelastic demand, the demand for it will not be affected by the price of it. For example, if the price of salt increases, people will not buy less of it. They need their daily salt intake. The demand of salt is therefore price-inelastic.\nElasticity is often measured in percents. If a 2% increase in price causes people to buy 1% fewer of a product, it has a price elasticity of demand of -0.5. "}

{"id": "51390", "revid": "366212", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51390", "title": "Metamorphosis", "text": "Metamorphosis in biology means the process of transformation from an immature form to an adult form in two or more distinct stages. Good examples are insects and amphibians. Life for most insects begins as a larva or nymph then progresses to the pupa stage and ends as an adult.\nAnimals that metamormetamorphosize include tadpoles into frogs, caterpillars into butterflys, bee larva into bees, and more\nInsects.\nThere are two main types of metamorphosis in insects:\nsimple metamorphosis or \"hemimetabolism\", and complete metamorphosis or \"holometabolism\".\nSimple metamorphosis or \"hemimetabolism\".\nInsects who go through simple (or incomplete) metamorphosis have three life stages. These insects start as eggs, which are usually very small. When the egg hatches, a larva or nymph comes out. Nymphs are just baby insects. Most of the time, the nymph looks similar to the adult, but it is smaller, may have different colouration, and does not have wings. The nymph grows through stages called \"instars\", shedding its 'skin' (\"epicuticle\") at each stage (\"ecdysis\"). Finally, it changes into a mature adult with wings.\nSome insect nymphs are aquatic, which means they live in water. These nymphs usually have gills and look very different from the adults they will turn into. Nymphs that live in water are called \"naiads\".\nSome insects that have a life cycle of egg-nymph-adult are:\nComplete metamorphosis or \"holometabolism\".\nInsects that have complete metamorphosis have four life stages. These insects start as eggs, which are very small. The egg hatches and a larva comes out. The larva looks like a worm and eats and eats so that it can grow much bigger. When the larva has grown it changes into a pupa. The pupa usually can not move or eat. The pupa is a special time when the insect is changing into an adult that will look very different from the larva or the pupa. Moth pupae (plural of pupa) are inside cocoons. When the pupa opens, the adult insect comes out.\nMany insects have a life cycle of egg-larva-pupa-adult. Some of these insects are:\nThe monarch butterfly.\nThe monarch butterfly goes through four stages of development. Life for a monarch butterfly begins as an egg hatched from an adult. This egg then develops into a worm-like larva caterpillar. In the pupa or chrysalis stage, the caterpillar spins a silk pad on a twig or leaves and hangs from this pad by its last pair of prolegs. It hangs upside down in the shape of a \"J\" and then molts leaving it encased in a green exoskeleton. The mature butterfly emerges after about two weeks and feeds on a variety of flowers including milkweed flowers, red clover and goldenrod.\nAmphibian metamorphosis.\nIn typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads, and newts all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Afterwards, newt larvae start a predatory lifestyle, while tadpoles mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges.\nMarine organisms.\nMany marine species have evolved a system where they release their eggs and sperm into the water at the same time, and fertilisation takes place in the sea over one or two days. This increases their chance of reproductive success.\nThen, larvae join the other plankton, eating and growing before metamorphosing into adults. Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a life cycle with pelagic larvae or even pelagic eggs. These have the capacity to be transported long distances, and so spread the species around to other places.\nNeed for metamorphosis.\nThe need for metamorphosis is clear when the relative size of eggs and adults is understood. A mature Atlantic cod can reach two metres long, and weigh over 200 pounds (96\u00a0kg). The female will produce over 100,000 eggs in a single spawning, and the resulting larvae are quite tiny. There is no way they could live like the adults, which are more or less top predators. The larvae cannot even swim against the current. Therefore, they must live a different kind of life before they can live as the adults do.\nTheir development is packaged into stages, and each stage has adaptations to life at its stage. The sharp distinction between stages (best seen in insects) is presumably because a longer transition would leave the juvenile less fit, either at its younger or older ways of life."}

It is also used to indicate a characteristic of resistance to future negative events. This psychological meaning of resilience is often contrasted with \"risk factors\".\nMaterials.\nIn physics and engineering, resilience is defined as the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically and then, upon unloading to have this energy recovered. In other words, it is the maximum energy per volume that can be elastically stored. It is represented by the area under the curve in the elastic region in the Stress-Strain diagram.\nModulus of Resilience, formula_1, can be calculated using the following formula: formula_2, where formula_3 is yield stress, E is Young's modulus, and formula_4 is strain.\nAn example of a biomaterial which has a high resilience is articular cartilage, the substance lining the ends of bones in articulating joints such as the knee and hip.\nSystems.\nEcology.\nIn ecology, resilience has been defined in two competing fashions that emphasize two different aspects of stability.\nOne definition is the rate at which a system returns to a single steady or cyclic state following a perturbation. This definition of resilience assumes that behavior of a system remains within the stable domain that contains this steady state.\nWhen a system can reorganize, that is shift from one stability domain to another, a more relevant measure of ecosystem dynamics is ecological resilience. It is a measure of the amount of change or disruption that is required to transform a system from being maintained by one set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures to a different set of processes and structures.\nThe second definition emphasizes conditions far from any steady-states, where instabilities can flip a system into another regime of behavior - i.e. to another stability domain. In this case resilience is measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control behavior. This type of resilience has been defined as ecological resilience.\nEconomic and business.\nEconomic resilence is the ability of a local economy to retain function, employment and prosperity in the face of the perturbation caused by the shock of the loss of a particular type of local industry or employer.\nIndustrial and organisational safety.\nWithin the broad domain of industrial safety, the term resilience has come into use to emphasise that safety must be proactive as well as reactive. Whereas conventional risk management approaches emphasise calculation of failure probabilities, resilience engineering looks for ways to strengthen the ability of organisations to create processes that are robust yet flexible.\nNetwork.\nResilience is the ability of the network to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation.\nResilient networks aim to provide acceptable service to applications:"}

It began on March 26, 1971 with Operation Searchlight. \nHistory.\nIn 1947, the United Kingdom split British India into two countries: India and Pakistan. The idea was that Hindus would live in India and Muslims would live in Pakistan. But it was not so simple. Because Hindus and Muslims lived in so many different places, East Pakistan and West Pakistan were about 1000 miles apart, with all of India in between them. Also, not all Muslims are the same. The East Pakistanis and West Pakistanis did not speak the same language and did not always like each other.\nThere were fewer West Pakistanis than East Pakistanis, but West Pakistanis controlled most of the government. After the Bhola Cyclone damaged East Pakistan, West Pakistan did not send enough help. Because of these things, East Pakistanis started to want to be a separate country from East Pakistan. The government in East Pakistan started Operation Searchlight to stop this separatist movement.\nEast Pakistan would later become Bangladesh. The people who lived there called themselves Bengalis. Some of the Bengalis were not Muslims but Hindus.\nIn 1970, Pakistan held its first general election. Before this, the military had limited voters' rights. The West Pakistanis voted for many different political parties, but most of the East Pakistanis voted for the same political party, called the Awami League. This meant the East Pakistani candidates would have a majority in Pakistan's assembly. This East Pakistani political party was led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\nGeneral Yahya Khan, a West Pakistani and leader, did not want the East Pakistani candidates to run the country, so he declared martial law, meaning the army was in charge of the country. The East Pakistanis were angry. They did protests and riots in 1970 and 1971.\nKhan and Mujibur met with each other to talk to try to solve the problems and stop the riots. It looked like they had made an agreement. But on March 25, 1971, Mujibur was arrested. Then, thousands of West Pakistani soldiers, 60,000 to 80,000 of them, began killing East Pakistanis. Bangladesh declared itself an independent country the next day.\nWest Pakistani soldiers killed Hindus, Bengali Muslims, smart people, students and politicians in order to kill them all. They went to schools and killed everybody there. The soldiers killed college professors at Dhaka University and other intellectual leaders because they thought they were the ones encouraging other East Pakistanis to want to be a separate country. They especially killed Hindu leaders. Then they killed young Hindu men because they thought young Hindu men would want to fight against them. A \"TIME\" magazine article said \"The Hindus are three-fourths of the refugees and most of the dead, have most disliked by the Muslim soldiers.\"\nMore than 200,000 women were raped. Some of the women were raped in front of husbands or male relatives. Other women were captured to be slaves for the West Bengali soldiers.\nTwo Muslims called Al-Shams and Al-Badr were told by the Pakistanis to kill Bengali Hindus and traitory Bengali Muslims also. There are many graves with a lot of people in Bangladesh, and new graves with a lot of people are always being discovered.\nA bad set of killings took place during Operation Searchlight, a series of killings which began on March 25, 1971 and ended on December 16, 1971 and led to death of 3 million Bengalis in East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), and other things like rape and looting. Originally, the Pakistanis wanted to take over the big cities in Bangladesh and control everybody in one month. They did not expect that the Bengalis would fight back, which they did. Pakistanis got very angry and started to kill all the Bengalis.\nEventually, the Bengali freedom fighters under the Mukti Bahini would seek help from India to win against the Pakistanis. India sent its army in and fought the Pakistanis with the Bengalis until Pakistan was totally defeated and went away from Bangladesh on December 16, 1971.\nNumber of people killed.\nPeople disagree about how many people died. According to the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, it could have been as few as 500,000 or as many as 3 million. This was during the Cold War, so different groups said more or fewer people died depending on what their own political ideas and goals were. The Soviets said it was 3 million. The United States CIA said it was 200,000. Pakistan was an ally of the United States at the time, and the West Pakistani soldiers used weapons that the United States had given them. India and Bangladesh also say that nearly 3 million were killed.\nIn 1997 R. J. Rummel wrote a book called \"Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900\", In Chapter 8 called \"Statistics Of Pakistan's Democide - Estimates, Calculations, And Sources\" he says:\nRummel says this was an act of killing specific groups of people. He writes that \"Consolidating both ranges, I give a final estimate of Pakistan's democide to be 300,000 to 3,000,000, or a prudent 1,500,000.\"\nLegacy.\nNot everyone agrees that the atrocities were a genocide. Nationalist Bangladeshis call this a genocide. Islamic Fundamentalists Pakistan call that \"Bengali Lies.\" Bangladeshi authorities and some independent organizations say that between 1-3 million people were killed. Another 10 million ran away from the country to be safe in Indias West Bengal province.\nTrials.\nNone of the people involved in the genocide were put on trial until 2011. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunals convicted 26 people for genocide and crimes against humanity. Some were executed. International organizations said that the accused were not treated fairly."}

He was a production designer for Hanna-Barbera Productions and the artist/character designer of Scooby-Doo.\nBiography.\nIwao Takamoto's father moved from Hiroshima to the United States for his health. He only went back to Japan once, and that was to marry his wife. Iwao Takamoto was born on April 19 1925 in Los Angeles, California. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Iwao Takamoto's family, like many Japanese-Americans, had to move to an internment camp. They spent the rest of World War II in the Manzanar internment camp. While he was there, Iwao Takamoto received basic illustration training from other people in the camp.\nIwao Takamoto first started doing cartoons professionally after the end of the war. He was hired as an assistant animator by Walt Disney Studios in 1947. Iwao Takamoto eventually became an assistant animator for the legendary Milt Kahl. He worked as an animator on such titles as \"Cinderella\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\", and \"Lady and the Tramp\".\nTakamoto left Disney in 1961 and joined Hanna-Barbera shortly afterwards. He did many jobs there, but is probably best known as a character designer. He was responsible for the original character designs of such characters as Scooby-Doo, \"The Jetsons\"' dog Astro, and Penelope Pitstop. He worked as a producer at Hanna-Barbera, supervising shows such as \"The Addams Family\", \"Hong Kong Phooey\", and \"Jabberjaw\". He directed several feature-length animated films, including \"Charlotte's Web\" (1973) and \"Jetsons: The Movie\" (1990). The inspiration for Scooby-Doo's creation as a Great Dane came from an employee of the Hanna-Barbera company who bred this dog.\nTakamoto was Vice-President of Creative Design at Hanna-Barbera, and was responsible for overseeing Hanna-Barbera's product-related merchandising. In 2005, he received the Golden Award from the Animation Guild, to honor his more than 50 years of service in the animation field.\nHe died on January 8, 2007 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles from heart failure at age 81."}

Most of are marine, but many live in freshwater or on land. Their fossil record goes back to the later Cambrian.\nSlugs and snails, abalones, limpets, cowries, conches, top shells, whelks, and sea slugs are all gastropods. \nThe gastropods are in origin sea-floor predators, though they did evolve into many other habitats. Many lines living today evolved in the Mesozoic era, taking advantage of the huge supply of food on the sea floor.\nGeneral description.\nSnails have torsion, a process where the body coils to one side during development. The significance of this procedure is not yet clear.\nThey have a well-defined head with two or four sensory tentacles. They also have a head-foot, which it moves on. The eyes at the tip of the tentacles range from simple to more complex eyes.\nMost members have a shell, which is in one piece and coiled or spiralled; it usually opens on the right hand side (viewed with the shell apex pointing up). Some species have an operculum, a lid or trapdoor to close the shell. In some, the slugs, the shell is absent, and the body is streamlined. The best-known gastropods are land slugs and snails, but more than half of all species live in a marine environment. Marine gastropods include herbivores, detritus feeders, carnivores and a few ciliary feeders, in which the radula is reduced or absent. The radula is usually adapted to the food that a species eats.\nThe simplest gastropods are the limpets and abalones, both herbivores that use their hard radulas to rasp at seaweeds on rocks. Many marine gastropods are burrowers and have siphons or tubes that extend from the mantle and sometimes the shell. These act as snorkels, enabling the animal to continue to draw in a water current containing oxygen and food into their bodies. The siphons are also used to detect prey from a distance. These gastropods breathe with gills. Some freshwater species and almost all terrestric species have developed lungs.\nGastropods from several different families are called sea slugs. They are often flamboyantly coloured. This may be either as a warning if they are poisonous or to camouflage them on the corals and seaweeds where many of them live. Their gills are often feathery plumes on their backs. This is what gives the name to the nudibranchs. Nudibranchs with smooth or warty backs have no visible gill mechanisms and respiration may take place directly through the skin. A few of the sea slugs are herbivores and some are carnivores. Many have distinct dietary preferences and regularly occur in association with certain species.\nClassification.\nThe taxonomy of the Gastropoda is under constant revision: two major revisions have been published in the last twenty years. There will certainly be other revisions using the data from DNA sequencing. At present, the taxonomy of the Gastropoda may differ from author to author.\nAccording to modern cladism, the taxonomy of the Gastropoda should be written in terms of strictly monophyletic groups. That means only one lineage of gastropods in each group. It will be difficult to do this, and still have a practical taxonomy for working biologists. Classifying animals in practice means using morphology (what they look like). But there are differences between the older groupings got from morphology, and those based on genome sequences. Convergent evolution, which has occurred often in Gastropods, may account for this.\nThis was the traditional classification into four subclasses:\nGeological history.\nThe first gastropods were exclusively marine. The first of the group appeared in the Upper Cambrian (\"Chippewaella\", \"Strepsodiscus\"). By the Ordovician period the gastropods were a varied group present in a few aquatic habitats. Commonly, fossil gastropods from the rocks of the early Palaeozoic era are too poorly preserved for accurate identification. Still, the Silurian genus \"Poleumita\" contains fifteen identified species. Fossil gastropods are less common during the Palaeozoic era than bivalves.\nMost of the gastropods of that era belong to primitive groups. A few of these groups still survive today. By the Carboniferous period many of the shapes seen in living gastropods can be matched in the fossil record. Despite these similarities in appearance, the majority of these older forms are not directly related to living forms. It was during the Mesozoic era that the ancestors of many of the living gastropods evolved. One of the earliest known terrestrial (land-dwelling) gastropods is \"Maturipupa\" which is found in the Coal Measures of the Carboniferous period in Europe. In the case of the common fossil \"Bellerophon\", from Carboniferous limestones in Europe, it is not known whether it is a gasropod or not.\nRelatives of the modern land snails are rare before the Cretaceous period. The familiar \"Helix\" first appeared in that period.\nIn rocks of the Mesozoic era gastropods are more common as fossils and their shell is often well preserved. Their fossils occur in beds of both freshwater and marine environments. The Purbeck Marble of the Jurassic period and the Sussex Marble of the early Cretaceous, which both occur in southern England, are limestones containing the tightly packed remains of the pond snail \"Viviparus\".\nRocks of the Cainozoic era have very large numbers of gastropod fossils in them. Many of these fossils are closely related to modern living forms. The diversity of the gastropods increased markedly at the beginning of this era, along with that of the bivalves.\nGastropods are one of the groups that record the changes in fauna caused by the advance and retreat of the Ice Sheets during the Pleistocene epoch.\nGastropod pages.\nThese pages illustrate the variety of gastropod forms.\nAbalone; \nconch; \ncowry; \nlimpet; \nnudibranch; \nsea slug; \nslug; \nsnail; \nwhelk."}

The phrase \"true limpets\" is used only for marine limpets in the ancient clade Patellogastropoda. This article is mainly about the true limpets.\nTrue limpets are small marine gastropod molluscs with flattened, cone-shaped shells. They live throughout the intertidal zone, attached to rocks or other hard ground. They attach themselves using mucus and a muscular \"foot\", which seals them against the rock and protects them from desiccation during low tide, and from high-energy waves action.\nLimpets eat by grazing on algae found on rock surfaces. They scrape films of algae from the rock with a radula, a ribbon-like tongue with rows of teeth. Limpets move by rippling the muscles of their foot in a wave-like motion. Most limpets are less than 3in (8cm) long, but a West Mexican Limpet grows to be 8in (20\u00a0cm).\nSome key-hole limpets have a hole at the top, through which gas exchange can occur (they are not true limpets).\nFossil record &amp; taxonomy.\nThere are many limpets in the Paleozoic fossil record, from the lower Cambrian, but none can be placed with certainty in the Patellogastropoda. Some might be Monoplacophorans, which is a separate mollusc class with a similar life-style. The earliest patellogastropod verified by shell microstructure is from the Triassic of Italy, but it is in the Upper Cretaceous and Cainozoic periods that many of the living forms make their first appearance.\nLife style.\nThe life-style of limpets is sessile: they stick fast to rocks or other hard substrates.\nHoming behaviour.\nSome species of limpets return to the same spot on the rock known as a \"home scar\" just before the tide ebbs. It is thought that they follow chemical trails. In such species, the shape of their shell often grows to precisely match the contours of the rock surrounding the scar. This behaviour permits a better seal to the rock. It is thought that they follow a mucus trail left as they move.\nWhere the limpets eat the algae, off bare rocks, it causes places where other organisms can grow and thrive. Some species, such as \"Lottia gigantea\" \"garden\" a patch of algae around their home scar. They push other organisms out of this patch by ramming with their shell, allowing their patch of algae to grow for their own grazing.\nPredators and threats.\nLimpets are prey for starfish, shore-birds, fish, seals, and humans. They have a two main defences; fleeing (letting go in the water) or clamping their shells against the surface they are on. The defence response can be adjusted to the type of predator, which can often be detected chemically by the limpet.\nLimpets can be long lived, with tagged specimens surviving for more than 10 years. If the limpet lives on bare rock, it grows at a slower rate but can live for up to 20 years.\nLimpets found on sheltered shores (limpets that are less frequently in contact with wave action, and thus less frequently in contact with water) have a greater risk of desiccation because of the effects of sunlight, water evaporation and the wind. To avoid drying out they will clamp to the rock they inhabit, minimizing water-loss from the rim around their base. As this occurs chemicals are released that promote the vertical growth of the shell.\nReproduction.\nLimpets are hermaphrodites (producing both male and female reproductive cells) and undergo sex change during life. They become male at about 9 months, but after a couple of years they change sex to become female. Spawning occurs once a year, usually during winter, and is triggered by rough seas which disperse the eggs and sperm. Larvae are pelagic for a couple of weeks before settling onto a hard substrate."}

This is also called ear-shell, \"ormer\" in Guernsey, \"abalone\" in South Africa, and \"p\u0101ua\" in New Zealand.\nThe meat of this shellfish is thought to be delicious in some parts of Latin America (especially Chile), South East Asia, and East Asia (especially in China, Japan, and Korea).\nDescription.\nAbalones live all over the world, They can be seen along the waters of every continent, except the Atlantic coast of South America, the Caribbean, and the East Coast of the United States. Most abalones are found in cold waters, along the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, and Western North America and Japan in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Chilean Pacific coast, the species called loco (\"Concholepas concholepas\") has a hard, black shell, and is eaten by many people.\nAbalone have unique features: the shell is round, with two to three spirals. The last spiral is grown into a large \"ear\"-like shape, which explains the name 'ear-shell'. The inside of the shell is shiny, from silvery white to green-red mother-of-pearl.\nAbalones can start to give birth at a small size. Their fertility is high and increases with size (from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time).\nYoung albalones, called larvae, feed on plankton. The adults eat plants and feed on algae. They like to eat red algae. Their size can be as small as 20\u00a0mm to as big as 200\u00a0mm.\nAbalone shell.\nThe shell of the abalone is known for being very strong. It is made of very tiny calcium carbonate tiles stacked like bricks. Between the layers of tiles is a sticky protein substance. Allergic skin reactions and asthma attacks can happen when breathing the dust made when these tiles are broken down.\nThe colorful inside part of the abalone shell can be used for decorative inlays, in guitars, for example.\nAbalone trade.\nCalifornia.\nSport harvesting of red abalone is allowed with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card. Abalone may only be taken using breath-hold techniques: freediving or shorepicking. SCUBA diving for abalone is strictly not allowed. Abalone harvesting is not allowed south of the mouth of the San Francisco Bay. There is a size minimum of seven inches measured across the shell and a limit of three per day and 24 per year that can be taken. Abalone may only be taken in April, May, June, August, September, October and November, but they may not be taken in July, December, January, February or March. Transportation of abalone is only legal while the abalone is still attached to the shell. Sale of sport-caught abalone is illegal, including the shell. Only red abalone may be taken; black, white, pink, and flat abalone are protected by law.\nAbalone divers normally use a very thick wetsuit, including a hood, booties, and gloves. They also wear a mask, snorkel, weight belt, abalone iron, and abalone gauge. It is common to take abalone in water a few inches up to 10 m/28' deep. Fewer freedivers can work deeper than that. Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources (kelp). An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it can fully clamp down. Visibility is normally five to ten feet. Divers commonly dive out of boats, kayaks, tube floats or directly off the shore. An eight-inch abalone is considered a good catch, a nine-inch would be very good, and a ten-inch plus (250\u00a0mm) abalone would be an excellent catch. Rock- or shore-picking is a different method from diving where the rock picker feels below rocks during low tides for abalone.\nThere has been a trade in diving to catch abalones off parts of the United States coast from before 1939. In World War II, many of these abalone divers were recruited into the United States armed forces and trained as frogmen.\nBlack market.\nThere is a worldwide black market in the collection and export of abalone meat. In New Zealand, where abalone is called p\u0101ua in the M\u0101ori language, this can be a particular problem. The right to harvest p\u0101ua can be granted legally under M\u0101ori customary rights. When such permits are overused, it is difficult to police. The legal daily limit is 10 p\u0101ua per diver with a minimum shell length of 125 mm. The limit is strictly enforced by many Ministry of Fisheries officers with the help of the police. P\u0101ua 'poaching' is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands of abalones being taken illegally, mostly undersized. Convictions have caused removal of diving gear, boats and motor vehicles as well as fines and in rare cases; imprisonment. The Ministry of Fisheries expects in the year 2004/05, nearly 1000 tons of p\u0101ua will be poached, with 75% of that being undersized.\nHighly polished New Zealand p\u0101ua shells are extremely popular as gifts with their striking blue, green and purple iridescence. Transporting unprocessed abalone shells out of New Zealand is illegal.\nSouth Africa.\nThe largest abalone in South Africa, \"Haliotis midae\", can be found along about two-thirds of the country\u2019s coastline. Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting.\nChannel Islands, Europe.\nOrmers (\"Haliotis tuberculata\") are considered a delicacy in the Channel Islands and are looked after with great eagerness by the locals. Unfortunately, this has led to a huge decrease in numbers since the second half of the 19th century, and 'ormering' is now strictly regulated in order to keep stocks. The taking of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from the January 1 to April 30, which happen on the full or new moon and two days after that. No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under 8 cm in shell length. Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater. Any breach of these laws is illegal and can lead to a large fine. The demand for ormers is so big that it started the world's first underwater arrest, when Mr. Kempthorne-Leigh of Guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear while illegally diving for ormers.\nWhite Abalone are going extinct because of their delicious tender meat, jewlery, and beautiful shell.\nFarming.\nThere have been a number of attempts to artificially grow (farm) abalone for the purpose of consumption."}

{"id": "51465", "revid": "248920", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51465", "title": "Alban Berg", "text": "Alban Berg (born Vienna, 9 February 1885; died Vienna 24 December 1935) was an Austrian composer. Alban Berg and Anton Webern were both pupils of Arnold Schoenberg. All three composers in their own way changed the style of musical composition in the early 20th century. They grew up at a time when most composers were still writing Romantic music, but Schoenberg and his pupils started to write atonal music (music which is not in any key) and then twelve-tone music in which all 12 notes in an octave are of the same importance. Although Berg wrote a lot of twelve-tone music he still managed to make it sound quite Romantic at times, more so than Schoenberg or Webern. His most important works are his two operas \"Wozzeck\" and \"Lulu\" and his \"Violin Concerto\".\nLife.\nEarly years.\nBerg was brought up in the centre of Vienna. His family had plenty of money, but when Berg\u2019s father died in 1900 life became much harder for them. He did not do very well at school. He also had a love affair with a kitchenmaid, with whom he had a daughter.\nHe was interested in music, played the piano and had started to compose, but he had not done well enough in his school exams to get into the music conservatory. He was not interested in business like his father had been. He got an unpaid job. Then, in 1904, he started to study with Schoenberg. This was the first time he had been given proper music lessons. Two years later, his mother inherited some money, and Berg was then able to give up his unpaid job and concentrate on music.\nSchoenberg taught him harmony, counterpoint and music theory, all the things one needs to know to compose well. Berg had lessons from him from 1904 until 1911. His first proper pieces include a Piano Sonata and a String quartet. Here he had already found the modern style which suited him. He wrote harmonies which seemed to float. He often wrote pieces with several movements which are all linked by a common theme. He also liked themes which are heard upside down, or palindromes, where the tune sounds the same forwards as backwards. He met a girl called Helene and they married in 1910.\nAdulthood.\nBerg liked to listen to all kinds of music. In this way he was different to Schoenberg or Webern. Berg was interested in French composers such as Debussy, as well as jazz. He liked the modern theatre and the political works of the playwright Bertolt Brecht and the composer Kurt Weill. \nBerg was very grateful to Schoenberg for all that he had learned from him, but he still continued to be quite afraid of him. Schoenberg wrote many letters to him asking him to do things for him (e.g. making piano arrangements of his orchestral pieces) and often criticising him. Only in the 1920s, when Berg had become well-known, did Schoenberg start writing to him more like an equal friend.\nBerg wrote \"Five Orchestral Pieces\". It is one of the first important works he wrote without Schoenberg\u2019s help. The music has some modern chords which must have sounded very shocking to the Viennese audience. On 31 March 1913 Schoenberg conducted a concert in Vienna which included some songs by Berg. People in the audience started to fight and the police had to be called. When Schoenberg wrote to Berg criticising his music, Berg lost all his self-confidence. Slowly he started to get more confidence again. He wrote \"Three Orchestral Pieces\" op 6. The music sounds quite like Mahler. There are a lot of musical ideas which grow into one another and make a rich sound.\nDuring World War I Berg spent some time in an army training camp. This experience must have been in his mind when he wrote his opera \"Wozzeck\". This opera became very famous. There were a lot of new ideas in it. It is not about a great hero, but about a simple man who is mistreated by people. The music, too, is very different from opera music up to that time. Although it was so modern it was a great success and made Berg world-famous. It gave him more money which, together with a little teaching, allowed him to spend most of his time composing.\nYears of fame.\n\"Wozzeck\" has a little twelve tone music in it, but in his next works the twelve tone system is much more important. He wrote \"Lyrical Suite\" for String Quartet and a \"Kammerkonzert\" (\"Chamber Concerto\") in which the form is made up by mathematical rules. He liked to hide things in his music e.g. favourite numbers or letters from people\u2019s names. These are like secret codes and, in later years, musicians have spent a lot of time trying to work out what Berg was trying to do.\nIn 1928 Berg started work on his second and last opera: \"Lulu\". He had thought about the opera for many years. He had seen a play called \"Die B\u00fcchse des Pandora\" \"(Pandora\u2019s Box)\" in 1905. Wedekind had played the part of Jack the Ripper. People thought the play was obscene, but it still became very popular, especially after 1918 when there was no more censorship in Germany. He worked on the opera until 1934. He then stopped work on it to write his \"Violin Concerto\". When he heard about the sad death from poliomyelitis of a young girl he knew called Manon Gropius, he dedicated the concerto to her memory. He wrote: \u201cTo the memory of an angel\u201d. Manon\u2019s mother, Alma, had been the wife of Gustav Mahler.\nDeath.\nSoon after he had finished the Violin Concerto, Berg was stung by an insect. This formed an abscess and he was rushed to hospital but he died. The concerto had not yet been performed. He had not finished \"Lulu\". The third act was only sketched in short score (showing the main notes, but not exactly what each instrument plays). When the opera was first performed, Act III was just acted out in mime while some other music by Berg was played. Berg\u2019s widow Helene did not want anyone else to finish the opera, so Act III was never performed until after Helene died in 1976. It was finished by Friedrich Cerha and performed in 1977, although a court action had tried to stop it from being performed."}

One such example is the Horse Conch (\"Pleuroploca gigantea\"). The genus Strombus is made up of the true conches. \nWhile most Strombid species are extinct, at least 65 species still exist. Of these, most are in the Indo-Pacific Oceans while six are in the greater Caribbean region. Living true conch species include the Queen Conch, \"Strombus gigas\", and the West Indian Fighting Conch (\"Strombus pugilis\"). \nMany conch, such as the Queen Conch, are found among beds of sea grass in warm tropical waters.\n\"Strombus gigas\" is included in Appendix II of the UNEP's CITES list of endangered species and international trade is heavily restricted.\nAnatomy.\nConches have spirally constructed shells. Depending on species (or aberrant growth patterns), shell growth can be sinistral (left-handed) or dextral (right-handed).\nConches have long eye stalks, a long and narrow aperture, and a siphonal canal with an indentation near the anterior end. This indentation is called a stromboid notch. They also have a foot ending in a pointed, sickle-shaped, horny operculum. They grow a flared lip on their shells upon reaching sexual maturity. \nConches have a characteristic leaping motion, using their pointed, sickle-shaped, horny operculum to propel themselves forward. They lay eggs in long, gelatinous strands.\nHuman use.\nThe animal inside the shell is eaten, either raw, as in salads, or cooked, as in fritters, chowders, gumbos, and burgers. In East Asian cuisines, the meat is often cut into thin slices and then steamed or stir-fried. Conch meat is also often confused with Scungilli, which is more accurately whelk meat.\nConch shells are sometimes used as decoration, as decorative planters, and in cameo-making. As with other mollusk shells, they are ground up into an ingredient in porcelain. In classic Mayan art, conches are shown being utilized in many ways including as paint and ink holders for elite scribes, as bugle or trumpet, and as hand weapons (held by combatants by inserting their hands in the aperture).\nIn some countries, cleaned Queen Conch (\"Strombus gigas\") shells or polished fragments are sold, mainly to tourists, as souvenirs or in jewelry. Without a permit however, export is a breach of CITES regulations and may lead to arrest . This is most likely to occur on return to the tourist's home country while clearing customs. In the UK conch shells are the 9th most seized import. \nConch shells are occasionally used as a building material, either in place of bricks or as bulk for landfill.\nIt is also believed to be used as a weapon by the earliest Caribbean natives. \nPlaying the conch shell.\nConch shells are sometimes made into crude bugles by removing the small tip of the shell to form a mouthpiece. Such instruments are used in the Pacific Islands as well as in many parts of Asia. While lacking the range capabilities and tonal quality of brass instruments, the conch shell is still an interesting instrument to play. As it has no mouthpiece or valves, the embouchure in shell playing is critical. Most shells will only naturally play one note, but with pitch manipulations, multiple sounds can be achieved. The insertion of the hand and the placement of the fingers will also change the pitch of the shell. The conch shell is said to be the musical instrument of mermaids and mermen. Steve Turre is the leading innovator of the shell. It is sometimes found in classical works, such as the symphony piece \"La Noche de Los Mayas\", or \"Night of the Mayas\", which was premiered in 1939 with Jacob Watkins on percussion and conch.\nReligious symbolism.\nHindu tradition.\nThe conch shell is a major Hindu article of prayer, used as a trumpeting announcement of all sorts. The God of Preservation, Vishnu, is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life as it has come out of life-giving waters. In the story of Dhruva the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient India would blow conch shells to announce battle, such as is famously represented in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra in the Mahabharata, the famous Hindu epic. The conch shell is a deep part of Hindu symbolic and religious tradition. To this very day, many Hindus use the conch as a part of their religious practices, blowing it during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells.\nSee also: Krishna\nBuddhist tradition.\nBuddhism also has incorporated the conch into its symbolism. See: Buddhist symbolism.\nLiterature.\nWilliam Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\" features frequent references to \"The Conch\". In the novel, a conch shell is blown to call the other boys together. It is held by whoever is speaking at meetings, symbolically representing democracy and order. When Roger, Jack's lieutenant, smashes the shell, it is a sign that civilized order has collapsed and Jack's domination has begun."}

There are about 200 different species of cowry.\nShell.\nThe shell itself is almost always very smooth and shiny. They have with a long, narrow, slit-like opening. All varieties have a porcelain-like shine and many have colorful patterns. In life the shell is covered by the slippery mantle.\nShell sizes range from 5\u00a0mm (1/5\") for some tropical species to 15\u00a0cm (6\") for the tiger cowry, \"Cypraea tigris\".\nPredators.\nThe slippery shell is very difficult for most animals to grip. The very narrow toothed aperture of the cowry shell makes it difficult for predators to reach into. However cowries are still vulnerable to predation:\nTaxonomy.\nFor nearly 200 years, every species in the family Cypraeidae was placed in one genus, \"Cypraea\", but in 2002 the cowries were divided into many different genera.\nUses.\nCowries (esp. \"Cypraea moneta\") were used as a currency in Africa (Ghanaian cedi in Ghana named after cowry shells) and elsewhere, such as in China where the shell or copies of the shell were in theory used as a means of exchange. They are also worn as jewelry or otherwise used as ornaments or charms, as they are viewed as symbols of womanhood, fertility, birth and wealth. Many find the shiny, porcelain-like shells pleasing to look at.\nCowry shells are sometimes used in a way similar to dice, e.g., in board games like Pachisi, or in divination (cf. If\u00e1 and the annual customs of Dahomey).\nA number of shells (6 or 7 in Pachisi) are thrown, with those landing aperture upwards indicating the actual number rolled.\nCowries have also been used in the recent past as a frame over which sock heels were stretched for darning. The cowry ridges allowed the needle to get under the cloth more easily.\nThe Ojibway aboriginal people in North America used the cowry shells in ceremonies, and the Whiteshell Provincial Park in Manitoba, Canada is named after this type of shell. There is some debate about how they traded for or found these shells so far inland, away from the natural sources. Oral stories and birch bark scrolls seem to indicate that they were found in the ground, and/or washed up on the shores of lakes or rivers. The cowry shells so far inland may indicate the use of them by an earlier tribe or group in the area, and an extensive trade network in the ancient past.\nThe typewritten postage stamps of 1895 Uganda also are called \"Cowries\"."}

{"id": "51487", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51487", "title": "Cephalopod", "text": "The Cephalopoda (Greek meaning \"head-foot\") is an important mollusc class. They have bilateral symmetry, a head, and arms or tentacles. Teuthology, a branch of malacology, is the study of cephalopods.\nThe class has two living subclasses. In the Coleoidea, the mollusc shell has become smaller, or is not there at all; this subclass has the octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. The \"Nautiloidea\" have a shell; \"Nautilus\" is its only living genus.\nThere are at least 800 different living species of Cephalopods. Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonites, and the Belemnites (order \"Belemnoidea\", of class Coleoidea). Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of the world and at all pelagic levels. None of them can live in freshwater (water with no salt in it), but a few species live in brackish (partly salty) water.\nNumber of species.\nThere are still discoveries of new species of cephalopods:\nThere are many more fossil species. It is thought there are around 11,000 extinct taxa.\nNervous system and behaviour.\nCephalopods are the most intelligent invertebrates and have good senses and large brains. The nervous system of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates, and their brain to body mass ratio falls between that of warm and cold blooded vertebrates. The giant nerve fibers of the cephalopod mantle have been a favourite experimental material for many years; their large diameter makes them easier to study.\nColour and light.\nMost cephalopods have chromatophores \u2013 that is, cells with different colours \u2013 which they can use in a number of surprising ways. As well as blending with their background, some cephalopods bioluminesce, shining light downwards to hide their shadows from any attackers. The bioluminescence is made by bacterial symbionts; the host cephalopod is able to find the light made by these animals. Bioluminescence may also be used to attract prey, and some species use colourful shows to get mates, amaze predators, or even signal to one another.\nColouration.\nColouration can be changed in milliseconds as they adjust to their environment, and the pigment cells can expand or contract. Rapid colour change is usually more common in near-shore species than those living in the open ocean. Those in open ocean mostly use camouflage to make their body outline less easy to see.\nEvidence of original colouration has been found in cephalopod fossils as far back as the Silurian; certain straight-shelled species had lines round their shell, which are thought to have used as camouflage of their body outline. Devonian cephalopods bear more complex colour patterns, whose function may be more complex.\nMoving around.\nCephalopods usually move by jet propulsion (squirting water). This uses a lot of energy to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. They use jet propulsion because they do not have fins or flippers. The efficiency of jet propulsion goes down with larger animals. This is probably the reason why many species use their fins or arms for moving if possible.\nOxygenated water is taken into the mantle cavity to the gills. By contracting the mantle's muscles, the water is pushed out through the siphon, made by a fold in the mantle. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out forwards, but the siphon can be pointed in different directions. Some cephalopods can adjust their body shape to move through the water more easily.\nSome octopus species are also able to walk along the sea bed. Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by moving a flap of muscle around the mantle.\nInk.\nWith the exception of the Nautilidae and the species of octopus of the suborder Cirrina, all known cephalopods have an ink sac, which can be used to push out a cloud of dark ink to confuse predators.\nBlood.\nLike most molluscs, cephalopods use haemocyanin, a copper-containing protein, rather than haemoglobin to transport oxygen. As a result, their blood is colourless when deoxygenated and turns blue when placed in air.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nWith a few exceptions, Coleoideans live short lives with fast growth. Most of the energy from their food is used for growing. The penis in most male Coleoidea is a long and muscular end of the vas deferens (tube for sperms) used to transfer spermatophores (sperm packages) to a modified arm called a hectocotylus. That in turn is used to transport the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the penis is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female. The females lay many small eggs in one batch, and die afterwards. The Nautiloidea, on the other hand make a few large eggs in each batch, and live for a long time.\nEvolution.\nThe class developed during the late Cambrian and were the most common and varied marine life forms during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic eras. \"Tommotia\", an early cephalopod, had squid-like tentacles but also a snail-like foot it used to move across the sea floor. Early cephalopods were at the top of the food chain.\nThe old (cohort Belemnoidea) and modern (cohort Neocoleoidea) coleoids, as well as the ammonoids, all diverged (evolved away from) from the external shelled nautiloids during the middle Paleozoic Era, between 450 and 300 million years ago. Most ancient varieties had protective shells. These shells at first were conical but later developed into the curved shapes seen in modern nautilus species. Shells inside the body still exist in many living cephalopod groups, such as cuttlefish. The most famous group with external shells, the ammonites, became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period."}
{"id": "51496", "revid": "7806071", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51496", "title": "Cuttlefish", "text": "Cuttlefish are marine Cephalopod molluscs. They belong to the same class as squid, octopodes and the nautilus.\nCuttlefish have an internal shell (called a cuttlebone), large eyes, and eight arms and two tentacles furnished with finely toothed suckers, with which they grab their prey.\nCuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish and other cuttlefish. Various sharks and fish prey on them. They live about 1 to 2 years.\nAnatomy.\nCuttlebone.\nCuttlefish have an internal cuttlebone, made of calcium carbonate. It is porous, full of small holes, The buoyancy of the cuttlebone can change, allowing the cuttlefish to go lower or higher by changing the amount of gas and liquid in its chambers. The cuttlebone of each species has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. Cuttlebones are used by jewellers and silversmiths as moulds for casting small objects. They are probably better known today as the material given to pet birds as a source of calcium. The cuttlebone is only found in cuttlefish, and is one of the features that makes them different from squid and other molluscs.\nChanging color.\nCuttlefish are sometimes called the chameleon of the sea because they are able to change their skin color. Their skin can flash a colorful pattern in order to communicate with other cuttlefish and to camouflage them from predators. This color-changing function is produced by groups of red, yellow, brown, and black pigmented chromatophores above a layer of reflective iridophores and leucophores. These are all in the cuttlefish's skin, and work together to change its colour. There are up to 200 of these special pigment cells per square millimeter.\nThe pigmented chromatophores have a sac of pigment and a large membrane that is folded when retracted. There are 6-20 small muscle cells on the sides which can contract to squash the elastic sac into a disc against the skin.\nIridophores are plates of chitin or protein, which can reflect light. They are responsible for the metallic blues, greens, golds, and silvers often seen on cuttlefish. All of these cells can be used in combinations. As well as being able to influence the colour of the light that reflects off their skin, cuttlefish can also affect the light's polarization, which can be used to signal to other animals which sense polarization.\nEyes.\nCuttlefish eyes are among the most developed in the animal kingdom. The way cephalopod eyes develop is fundamentally different from that of vertebrates like humans, but the way they work is rather similar. The similarity between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes is an examples of convergent evolution. Although they cannot see color, they can perceive the polarization of light, which improves their ability to see contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retina (known as fovea), one to look more forward, and one to look more backwards. The lenses, instead of being reshaped as they are in humans, are instead pulled around by reshaping the entire eye in order to change focus.\nBlood.\nThe blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue because it uses the copper-containing protein haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red iron-containing protein haemoglobin that is found in vertebrates. This is similar to the blood of arthropods. Haemocyanin is not as good at carrying oxygen as haemoglobin. The blood is pumped by three separate 'hearts'. Two of these are used for pumping blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart for each gill), and the third for pumping blood around the rest of the body.\nHuman interest.\nInk.\nCuttlefish have inks like squid and octopuses. As with squid, the ink is a defensive tool, squirted out to cover its retreat in the case of danger. This ink was formerly an important dye, called sepia. Today artificial (not natural) dyes have replaced natural sepia.\nCuttlefish as food.\nCuttlefish are caught for food in Mediterranean, and East Asian cultures. Although squid is more popular as a restaurant dish all over the world, in East Asia dried cuttlefish is highly popular.\nCuttlefish is popular in Italy and Croatia, where it is used in \"Risotto Nero\". \"Nero\" means 'black', which is the colour the rice turns because of the cuttlefish ink. Spanish cuisine often uses cuttlefish and squid ink for cooking due to the marine flavor and smoothness that it provides to the meals and it is included in dishes such as rice, pasta and fish stews.\nCuttlefish in literature.\nCuttlefish made their most important literary appearance in the title of Eugenio Montale's collection of poetry called Cuttlefish Bones (\"Ossi di seppia\"), published in Turin in 1925. Montale was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1975.\nClassification.\nThere are over 120 species of living cuttlefish, in 5 genera. Sepiadariidae contains seven species and two genera; all the rest are in the Sepiidae."}

{"id": "51499", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51499", "title": "Nautilus", "text": "Nautilus is the common name for cephalopods of the family Nautilidae. They are the only living members of the subclass Nautiloidea. In appearance, they have not changed much in millions of years. The term \"chambered nautilus\" is also used for any species of the Nautilidae.\nMany biologists see them as 'living fossils', because they are the only living descendents of the group which gave rise to the ammonites in the Palaeozoic era.\nToday, there are six living species in two genera. The species \"Nautilus pompilius\", from Western Australia is the largest and best known. It get up to 27\u00a0cm in diameter. However, most other nautiluses never exceed 20\u00a0cm. The Bellybutton nautilus, \"Nautilus macromphalus\", is the smallest species, usually measuring only 16\u00a0cm.\nThe radula is wide and has exactly nine teeth. There are two pairs of gills.\nThe shell.\nNautiluses are the only cephalopods who have an external shell. This is an ancestral or basal, feature. The animal can withdraw completely into its shell. It can the close the opening with a leathery hood formed from two specially folded tentacles. The shell is coiled and calcareous, with mother-of-pearl lining. It is pressure resistant, but will implode at a depth of about 800 m. The nautilus shell is made of two layers: the outer layer is a dull white, while the inner layer is a striking white with iridescence. The innermost portion of the shell is pearlescent, blue-gray. A osmena pearl is not a pearl, but a jewellery product got from this part of the shell.\nThe shell is internally divided into chambers. All the walls between chambers ('septa') are pierced in the middle by a duct, the siphuncle. Through this the animal can change the air pressure in the chambers. As the nautilus matures its body moves forward, sealing each chamber in turn with a new \"septum\" (wall). The last fully open chamber, the largest one, is used as the living chamber. The number of chambers increases from around four at the moment of hatching to thirty or more in adults.\nThe shell colour keeps the animal hidden in the water. When seen from the top, the shell is darker in color and marked with irregular stripes, which makes it blend into the darkness of the water below. The underside is almost completely white, making the animal indistinguishable from brighter waters near the ocean surface. This mode of camouflage is called \"countershading\".\nThe nautilus shell is one of the finest natural examples of a logarithmic spiral.\nNatural history.\nBuoyancy and movement.\nIn order to swim, the nautilus draws water into and out of the living chamber and makes use of jet propulsion. When water is inside the chamber, the siphuncle extracts salt from it and diffuses it into the blood. When water is pumped out, the animal adjusts its buoyancy with the gas contained in the chamber. Buoyancy can be controlled by the pumping of gas and fluid into or from the chambers using the siphuncle. The control of buoyancy like this limits the nautilus; they cannot operate under extreme pressure.\nIn the wild, nautilus usually lives in depths of about 300 m, rising to around 100 m at night for feeding, mating and egg laying. The shell of the nautilus cannot withstand depths greater than approximately 800 m.\nDiet and sensory system.\nNautiluses are predators and feed mainly on shrimp, small fish and crustaceans, which are captured by the tentacles. However, due to the very little energy they devote to swimming, they need only eat once a month. Unlike other cephalopods, they do not have good vision; their eye structure is highly developed but lacks a solid lens. They have a simple \"pinhole\" lens through which water can pass. Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use olfaction as the primary sensory means during foraging, locating or identifying potential mates.\nEvolution.\nFossil records indicate that nautiloids have not changed much (at least in their body form) for the last 500 million years. Nautiloids were much more common and varied 200 million years ago. Many of the early ones were straight-shelled, as in the extinct genus \"Lituites\". They developed in the Cambrian and became a significant sea predator in the Ordovician period. Some species reached over 2.5 meters in size. The other cephalopod subclass, Coleoidea, diverged from the Nautilidae long ago and the nautilus has remained relatively unchanged since. Extinct relatives of the nautilus include ammonites, which were very important for many millions of years. Other groups were the baculites and goniatites.\nReproduction and lifespan.\nNautiluses are sexually dimorphic and reproduce by laying eggs. Attached to rocks in shallow waters, the eggs take twelve months to develop before hatching out at around 30\u00a0mm long. Females spawn once per year and regenerate their gonads, making nautiluses the only cephalopods to repeat reproduction. The lifespan of nautiluses is about 20 years, which is exceptionally long for a cephalopod.\nDistribution.\nNautiluses are only found in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans, from 30\u00b0 N to 30\u00b0 S latitude and 90\u00b0 to 185\u00b0 W longitude. They live on the deep slopes of coral reefs."}

The logarithmic spiral was first described by Descartes and later extensively investigated by Jakob Bernoulli, who called it \"Spira mirabilis\", \"the marvelous spiral\".\nDefinition.\nIn polar coordinates (\"r\", \u03b8) the curve can be written as\nor\nhence the name \"logarithmic\". In parametric form, the curve is\nwith real numbers \"a\" and \"b\".\nThe spiral has the property that the angle \u0278 between the tangent and radial line at the point (\"r\",\u03b8) is constant. This property can be expressed in differential geometric terms as\nThe derivative r'(\u03b8) is proportional to the parameter \"b\". In other words, it controls how \"tightly\" and in which direction the spiral spirals. In the extreme case that \"b\" = 0 (\"\u0278\" = \u03c0/2) the spiral becomes a circle of radius \"a\". Conversely, in the limit that \"b\" approaches infinity (\"\u0278\" \u2192 0) the spiral tends toward a straight line. The complement of \u0278 is called the \"pitch\".\n\"Spira mirabilis\" and Jakob Bernoulli.\nSpira mirabilis, Latin for \"miraculous spiral\", is another name for the logarithmic spiral. While this curve had already been named by other mathematicians, the name \"miraculous\" or \"marvelous\" spiral was given to this curve by Jakob Bernoulli, because he was fascinated by one of its unique mathematical properties: the size of the spiral increases, but the shape stays the same with each added curve. Maybe because of this property, the spira mirabilis has evolved in nature, seen in some living beings, such as nautilus shells and sunflower heads. Jakob Bernoulli wanted the shape on his headstone, but, by error, an Archimedean spiral was placed there instead.\nNotes.\nThe logarithmic spiral can be distinguished from the Archimedean spiral by the fact that the distances between the turnings of a logarithmic spiral increase in geometric progression, while in an Archimedean spiral these distances are constant.\nLogarithmic spirals are self-similar in that they are self-congruent under all similarity transformations (scaling them gives the same result as rotating them). Scaling by a factor formula_6 gives the same as the original, without rotation. They are also congruent to their own involutes, evolutes, and the pedal curves based on their centers.\nStarting at a point \"P\" and moving inwards along the spiral, one has to circle the origin infinitely often before reaching it; yet, the total distance covered on this path is finite. This was first realized by Evangelista Torricelli even before calculus had been invented. The total distance covered is \"r\"/cos(\u03b1), where \"r\" is the straight-line distance from \"P\" to the origin.\nOne can construct approximate logarithmic spirals with pitch about 17.03239 degrees using Fibonacci numbers or the golden ratio as is explained in those articles. Similarly, the exponential function exactly maps all lines not parallel with the real or imaginary axis in the complex plane, to all logarithmic spirals in the complex plane with centre at 0. (Up to adding integer multiples of 2\u03c0\"i\" to the lines, the mapping of all lines to all logarithmic spirals is onto.) The pitch angle of the logarithmic spiral is the angle between the line and the imaginary axis.\nLogarithmic spirals in nature.\nIn several natural phenomena one may find curves that are close to being logarithmic spirals. Here follows some examples and reasons:"}

{"id": "51512", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51512", "title": "Argonauta", "text": "Argonauta, the argonauts, is the only living genus in the Argonautidae family. They are a group of pelagic octopods.\nThey are also called paper nautiluses, because of the paper-thin eggcase that females make. This structure does not have the gas-filled chambers of nautilus shells, and is not a true cephalopod shell. It is an evolutionary innovation unique to the genus \"Argonauta\".\nArgonauts are found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide: they live in open ocean. Like most octopods, they have a rounded body, eight arms and no fins. However, unlike octopuses, argonauts live close to the sea surface rather than on the seabed. \"Argonauta\" species have very large eyes and small distal webs. They have a mantle-funnel locking apparatus, which is a way to identify the genus. It consists of knob-like cartilages in the mantle and corresponding depressions in the funnel. Unlike the closely related genera \"Ocythoe\" and \"Tremoctopus\", \"Argonauta\" species lack water pores.\nPhysical description.\nSexual dimorphism and reproduction.\nIn Argonauts, males and females are quite different in size and lifespan. Females grow up to 10\u00a0cm and make shells up to 30\u00a0cm, while males rarely grow larger than 2\u00a0cm. The males only mate once in their short lifetime, but the females can get pregnant repeatedly. The females have been known since ancient times while the males were only described in the late 19th Century. The males use a modified arm, the hectocotylus, to transfer sperm to the female. For fertilization, the arm is inserted into the female's pallial cavity, then is detached from the male.\nThe hectocotylus was originally described as a parasitic worm. The hectocotyl arm and its correct function were described by Aristotle. His account was disbelieved for over 2000 years, but was rediscovered in the early 19th century.\nEggcase.\nFemale argonauts make a laterally compressed, calcareous eggcase in which they live. The eggcase curiously resembles the shells of extinct ammonites. It is secreted by the tips of the female's two greatly expanded dorsal tentacles (third left arms) before egg laying. After she deposits her eggs in the floating eggcase, the female herself takes shelter in it, often along with the male's detached hectocotylus. She is usually found with her head and tentacles protruding from the opening, but she retreats deeper inside if disturbed.\nThese ornate, curved white eggcases are occasionally found floating on the sea surface, sometimes with the female argonaut still clinging to it. It is made of calcite, with a 3-layered structure The argonauts may have evolved to use ammonite shells for their egg laying, eventually becoming able to mend the shells and perhaps even make their own.\nThe egg case also contains a bubble of gas used for buoyancy similar to shelled cephalopods, although it does not have chambers as seen in other shelled cephalopods.\n\"Argonauta argo\" is the largest species in the genus and also produces the largest eggcase, which may reach a length of 300\u00a0mm. The smallest species is \"Argonauta bottgeri\", with a maximum recorded size of 67\u00a0mm.\nBeak.\nThe beaks of \"Argonauta\" species are distinctive. They are characterised by a very small rostrum and a fold that runs to the lower edge or near the free corner. The rostrum is 'pinched in' at the sides. This makes it much narrower than in other octopuses, with the exception of the closely allied monotypic genera \"Ocythoe\" and \"Vitreledonella\". Argonaut beaks are most similar to those of \"Ocythoe tuberculata\" and \"Vitreledonella richardi\". They differ in 'leaning back' to a greater degree than the former and because they have a more curved jaw angle than the latter.\nFeeding and defense.\nFeeding mostly occurs during the day. Argonauts use tentacles to grab prey and drag it toward the mouth. It then bites the prey to inject it with poison from the salivary gland. They feed on small crustaceans, molluscs, but also jellyfish and salps. If the prey is shelled, the argonaut uses its radula to drill into the organism, then inject the poison.\nArgonauts are capable of changing their color. They can blend in with their surroundings to avoid predators. They also produce ink, which is ejected when the animal is being attacked. This ink paralyzes the olfaction of the attacker, providing time for the argonaut to escape. The female is also able to pull back the web covering of her shell, making a silvery flash, which may deter a predator from attacking.\nArgonauts are preyed upon by tunas, billfishes, and dolphins. Shells and remains of argonauts have been recorded from the stomachs of \"Alepisaurus ferox\" and \"Coryphaena hippurus\".\nMale argonauts have been seen living inside salps, which are planktonic tunicates. Little is known about this relationship.\nClassification.\nThe genus \"Argonauta\" contains up to seven existing species. Several extinct species are also known.\nThe extinct species \"Obinautilus awaensis\" was originally assigned to \"Argonauta\", but has since been transferred to the genus \"Obinautilus\"."}

Without it, an animal would be recognised easily. If the natural colour of an animal makes it look like its surroundings, that is camouflage. A tiger's stripes in the long grass, and the battledress of a modern soldier are examples.\nCamouflage is a form of deception. The word camouflage comes from the French word \"camoufler,\" which means \"to disguise\".\nNatural camouflage.\nIn nature, most animals blend into their environment or conceal their shape. They are very hard to see. This way they survive, and if they survive, then they can reproduce. There are exceptions: animals which are dangerous to eat (e.g. wasps) advertise with warning colouration.\nPrey animals hide from predators. Predators must search for prey without being seen. Natural camouflage is one way to do this: an animal can blend in with its surroundings. Another way is for the animal to disguise itself as something harmless.\nSome camouflaged animals also copy movements in nature, e.g., of a leaf blowing in the wind. Other animals attach natural materials to their body for concealment. A few animals change color in changing environments. Seasonally: (many Arctic animals, such as the arctic fox, or arctic hare). Or quickly, like the chameleon and the cuttlefish. Some herd animals, like zebra, have a pattern which makes it difficult for the predator when they are running.\nMimicry is a special kind of camouflage, where an animal or plant looks like another, usually one which is unpleasant to eat or dangerous.\nCountershading.\nMost animals are dark on top and light underneath. With light coming from the sky, this \"countershading\" makes them less visible. That this is the correct explanation is proved by cases where the animal lives upside down. A famous example is the Nile catfish, which swims belly uppermost. In this case, the belly is dark, and the back is light in colour.p43\nTransparency and silvering.\nTransparent or partly transparent animals are common in the pelagic layer of the sea. These are the layers into which light penetrates. The effect of transparency or silvering works is better under water than above it. This is because the amount of light which penetrates is less and less as the depth increases. Also, the proportion of the light reflected is much less under water (0.001\u20130.6%) than in air (2\u20135%)."}

They include sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and their relatives.\nEchinoderms have these features:\nEchinoderms live in all parts of the ocean, but mostly on the sea floor. Some are filter feeders, and others (starfish) are important predators of molluscs and other shell-fish. They are extremely common near the shore, and on reefs.\nThey have a long and abundant fossil record. This phylum appeared in the early Cambrian period; it contains about 7,000 living and 13,000 extinct species. The four or five main groups are called sub-phyla by some authorities, and classes by others.\nEchinodermata is the largest animal phylum which is entirely marine: no animals in this group live on land or in fresh or brackish water.\nTaxonomy.\nA simplified classification.\nFor many purposes it is better to use the following classification. It is easier to learn and understand, and is based more on the living forms.p19\nOnly with the crinoids is it necessary to deal with the fossil forms, because the stalked crinoids were so important on the Palaeozoic sea floors.\nGeneral account.\nAll echinoderms have fivefold radial symmetry in their body at some stage of life. The holothurians have bilateral symmetry as adults, and do not have so much of a skeleton as other groups.\nEchinoderms have a hydraulic water vascular system. This network of fluid-filled canals moves and feeds the animal, and allows gas exchange. There is also a complete digestive tube. They have a simple radial nervous system that consists of a modified nerve net. There are nerve rings with radiating nerves around the mouth extending into each arm. The branches of these nerves coordinate the movements of the animal. Echinoderms have no brain, although some do have ganglia. They usually move with their tube feet, but brittle stars use their arms to pull against rocks. Some feather stars and sea cucumbers can swim.\nThe sexes are usually separate. Sexual reproduction typically consists of releasing eggs and sperm into the water, with fertilization taking place externally. Their larvae are planktonic.\nMany echinoderms have remarkable powers of regeneration. A starfish arm cut off will regenerate. A section as small as a single arm, with some central disk and neural tissue, can regenerate the whole organism.\nEchinoderm larvae.\nMost of the adults have radial symmetry. If they are not sessile or attached, they are at least benthic (bottom-dwellers). In contrast, echinoderm larvae are planktonic, and have bilateral symmetry.p119 Echinoderm larvae are ciliated free-swimming organisms that have a bilaterally symmetry rather like embryonic chordates. The first stage in all groups except the crinoids is the dipleurula, which has a row of cilia winding round its body. All the groups have second and third stage larvae. The larvae grow, and are carried away from their parents.\nLater, the adult body grows into a radial form, with the body arranged in five parts around a central axis. This means they often have a star-shaped pattern.\nEvolution.\nThere is no geological evidence about the origin of echinoderms. The first undoubted fossils in the Lower Cambrian are already well developed, and fall into five or six different groups. \"Arkarua\", from the Ediacaran, is thought to be an echinoderm. \"Tribrachidium\" is another possible, from the same period. On general biological grounds, it seems that echinoderms, and some related phyla, may have been derived from worm-like ancestors.p311\nOf all invertebrate phyla, the echinoderms are the closest relatives to the chordata, that is, animals who have spinal cord, such as vertebrates. With the chordates and hemichordates, echinoderms are deuterostomes, one of the two major divisions of the animal kingdom."}

It is the first of the four operas that together tell a story called \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\").\n\"Das Rheingold\" is an opera in one act, divided into four scenes. It is a very long act, lasting 2 \u00bd hours, but it is normally played without an interval as the music is continuous, even between the scenes.\nThe characters in the opera are Gods, Giants, Nibelungs and the Rhinedaughters. The Nibelungs are a race of dwarfs. They are cunning and evil and live underneath the surface of the earth.\nThe story of the opera.\nScene 1.\nThe first scene takes place in the river Rhine where the three Rhinemaidens: Woglinde, Wellgunde and Flosshilde, are guarding the precious Rhine gold. Alberich, an evil Nibelung dwarf, arrives and tries to catch the Rhinemaidens. From what they say Alberich learns that the gold they are guarding gives the person who owns it the power to rule the world. Alberich wants the gold, but the Rhinemaidens say that anyone who wants to have it has to renounce (give up) love. They think that Alberich will not do that because he is very fond of girls, but Alberich does renounce love and so he gets the gold.\nScene 2.\nThe second scene takes place in Valhalla, which is where the gods live. Wotan, the chief god, is there with his wife Fricka. Two giants have been building an enormous castle for the gods. Wotan has promised them that he would pay them for their work by giving them Freia, the Goddess of Youth and Beauty. Fricka is worried about the promise that Wotan has made, but Wotan tells his wife that he is not going to keep his promise. He thinks he can find a way of tricking the giants. Freia enters. She is frightened because the giants are coming for her.\nThe giants, Fasolt and Fafner, enter. They want to have Freia in payment for having built the castle. The problem for the gods is that Freia has a garden in which she grows golden apples. If the gods no longer have these golden apples they will grow old and die. Wotan does not know what to do.\nLoge, the god of fire, enters. Wotan is cross with Loge for not having found something else to pay the giants with. Loge says he has been all over the world looking for something. He tells everyone that the gold from the Rhine has magic power, and how Alberich renounced love so that he could steal it from the Rhinemaidens. He tells them that a ring can be made from the gold, and that whoever has the ring will have power over all the world. The giants hear what Loge is saying and decide that they want the gold instead of Freia. They take Freia as hostage, saying that they will be back later to collect the gold. If they do not get it then they will keep Freia forever.\nWotan asks Loge how they are going to get the gold. Loge tells them that they should steal it from Alberich. After all, Alberich stole it from the Rhinemaidens, so it does not belong to him. Wotan and Loge go down below the earth to the Nibelungs.\nScene 3.\nUnderneath the earth Alberich is forcing the Nibelungs to work for him. They are hammering at the anvil. Mime, who is Alberich\u2019s brother, has used some of the gold to make a helmet. This helmet is called the Tarn helmet. Anyone who wears it can change their shape or become invisible. Alberich treats his brother very cruelly.\nWotan and Loge tell Alberich that they have heard how clever he is. They ask him to show them what he can do with the Tarn helmet. Alberich puts on the helmet and changes himself into a huge dragon. Wotan and Loge pretend to be impressed. They ask him whether he can change himself into something small. Alberich show off again, changing himself into a frog. Wotan immediately puts his foot on him and catches him. Wotan and Loge take all the gold and go back to Valhalla.\nScene 4.\nWotan and Loge tease Alberich. Alberich asks them what they want so that he can be free. Wotan demands the gold. The Nibelungs pile the gold up. Alberich is not too worried, because he still has the ring which gives him magic power. He thinks he can use this power later to get the gold back. Wotan sees the ring on Alberich\u2019s finger. He tells him to give him the ring. Alberich is terrified, but Wotan tears it from his finger. Before Alberich goes he puts a curse on the ring. Whoever has had the ring will die. This is very important to the whole story of the four operas.\nThe two giants appear with Freia. The gods have become very weak, but once Freia returns they start to become stronger again. Wotan tells the giants they can have their gold. The giants say that they must pile up the gold in front of Freia until they cannot see her. They do this, but the giants say there is still a tiny hole through which they can see Freia\u2019s eye. They see the ring on Wotan\u2019s finger and tell him to put it in the hole. Wotan says they can have anything they want but not the ring.\nErda appears. Erda is the Earth Goddess. She is very wise. She reminds Wotan that there is a curse on the ring and that he should quickly give the ring to the giants. Wotan has no choice. He puts the ring in the hole. Now the giants are happy.\nImmediately, however, the giants start to argue with one another and Fafner kills Fasolt. The curse on the ring is working. Loge tells Wotan he was wise to give up the ring. However, Fricka is still worried because Wotan did have the ring. \nDonner, the god of Thunder, enters and swings his hammer. There is a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder. The clouds vanish, a rainbow makes a bridge to Valhalla and the gods enter Valhalla. The Rhinemaidens are heard crying out to Wotan to give the gold back, but Wotan takes no notice. The gods are now at the height of their glory. We shall see, at the end of the fourth opera, that the curse will catch up with them and that they, too, will die.\nThe music.\nThe music of \"Das Rheingold\" is beautifully written to fit every person and every situation. The famous opening starts with a low chord of E flat which describes the bottom of the river Rhine. At first the notes of the chords are held on, then gradually a ripple of broken chords and arpeggios suggest the ripples of the water. The harps make a sound like the waves. The harmony just consists of the same E flat chord for the first 136 bars until the Rhine Maidens start to sing.\nEach character in the opera has his own musical leitmotif which can change and combine to show their changing moods and situations. There are big, heavy chords for the giants, creepy chromatic winding music for Loge, the god of fire, who is supposed to be very crafty, dignified music for the Earth Goddess Erda etc. There is a special leitmotif for the curse, which is heard at various times in all four operas.\nWagner actually called \"Das Rheingold\" a \"prologue\" to the other three operas, which he saw as the main operas of the cycle."}

It is the second of the four operas that together tell a story called \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"). The story continues from the first opera which was called \"Das Rheingold\". It is a very beautiful piece. \n\"Die Walk\u00fcre\" was first performed on 26 June 1870 in Munich. The first performance that was part of the whole Ring cycle took place on 14 August 1876.\nThe story of the opera.\nAct One.\nThe opera starts with a storm. The young man Siegmund is out in the storm and comes to a house. The house belongs to Hunding who lives there with his wife Sieglinde. An ash tree is growing in the middle of the house. Siegmund and Sieglinde are twins who were separated as children, so neither of them knows who the other one is. Their father is Wotan, the chief god, but they don\u2019t know this either. Their mother was a mortal (an ordinary person, not a goddess) or perhaps a she-wolf, which is how the goddess Fricka refers to her.\nSieglinde lets Siegmund into the house and gives him a drink of mead. They start to fall in love. Hunding arrives and asks Siegmund who he is. Siegmund says that his name ought to be Woeful because he has had an unhappy life. When he was small he came home once and found his house burned down, his mother murdered and his twin sister had been abducted (taken away). He then remembers that some years later he went to help a young lady who had been forced to marry a cruel man. He had killed some of the man\u2019s friends. Hunding realizes that he himself was this man, so that he is Siegmund\u2019s enemy. He says to Siegmund that he can sleep in his house tonight because this is a law of hospitality, but in the morning he will have to fight him.\nSieglinde goes to prepare a drink for her husband. She puts a drug in it which will make Hunding sleep deeply. Siegmund meanwhile is thinking about something his father had promised him. He had told him that he would thrust a magic sword called \u201cNothung\u201d into a tree. No one would get that sword until, one day, when Siegmund found himself in great difficulty, he would be able to pull it from the tree and use it.\nSieglinde enters and tells Siegmund a story about how, on the day she was forced to marry Hunding, an old man had come into the house and thrust a sword into the ash tree in the middle of the room. They start to realize that they are brother and sister, but it does not stop them from falling in love and they sing passionately about their love for one another. Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree and the two lovers embrace.\nAct Two.\nWotan is the chief god, whom we heard in \"Das Rheingold\". He is trying to get rid of the curse of the Rheingold, and has built a grand plan around Siegmund. Wotan tells his daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde that she must make sure that Siegmund wins the fight with Hunding. Br\u00fcnnhilde (the out-of-wedlock daughter of Wotan and Erda, the Earth-Mother goddess) has the power to do this. She is one of eight daughters of Wotan who are Valkyries (German: Walk\u00fcren). Their job is to collect the dead bodies of brave heroes who have died in battle and take them back to Valhalla, the house of the gods. \nWotan\u2019s wife Fricka arrives in a chariot pulled by a ram. Br\u00fcnnhilde disappears, and there follows a big argument between husband and wife. Fricka says to Wotan that Siegmund and Sieglinde must be punished for breaking Hunding's marriage, and for loving one another because brothers and sisters are not allowed to be lovers (this is called \u201cincest\u201d). She says that she herself is the goddess of marriage and must make sure that marriage laws are obeyed. Fricka says that the gods will all be disgraced. Wotan says that he went to the world to have children with mortal women because the gods needed a race of heroes who would protect them. But Fricka says to Wotan that he is wrong: Siegmund cannot be a free hero if he is being protected by Wotan. Giving in, Wotan now tells Br\u00fcnnhilde that she must leave Siegmund to his fate.\nSieglinde tells Siegmund that she feels guilty and that he ought to leave her, but they are desperately in love. When she hears Hunding\u2019s horn she imagines that Siegmund will be torn apart by the dogs and she faints. Br\u00fcnnhilde pities Siegmund. She tells Siegmund that he must follow her to Valhalla. When Siegmund asks whether he can take Sieglinde with her Br\u00fcnnhilde says that he cannot do this. Siegmund refuses to go. Br\u00fcnnhilde tells him that he cannot escape his fate. Siegmund continues to plead with Br\u00fcnnhilde, and in the end she is so moved that she changes her mind. She breaks Wotan's order, and says that she will protect Siegmund in battle. Hunding appears and the two men fight. Br\u00fcnnhilde protects Siegmund with her shield. Siegmund is nearly winning when suddenly Wotan appears and smashes Siegmund\u2019s sword into pieces. Hunding kills Siegmund.\nAct Three.\nThe other Valkyries are wondering where Br\u00fcnnhilde is. They see her coming on her horse, but instead of a hero she is carrying a woman (it is Sieglinde). The Valkyries are angry with Br\u00fcnnhilde because she disobeyed Wotan. Sieglinde wants to die, but when she is told that she has a baby in her womb she asks Br\u00fcnnhilde to save her. She escapes into the forest with bits of Siegmund\u2019s sword. One day the baby she is now bearing will grow up, become a hero, and use the bits to make another sword.\nWotan goes to the Valkyries. He is furious with Br\u00fcnnhilde because she disobeyed him. He punishes her. He tells her that she is no longer a Valkyrie. She will fall asleep on a rock and any man who finds her can have her. Br\u00fcnnhilde pleads with Wotan. She asks him whether he could, at least, put a fire round her so that the only man who could get her would be a hero. In the end Wotan agrees. Loge, the god of fire, arrives and lights the fire. At the end of the opera Br\u00fcnnhilde is asleep on the rock, surrounded by the fire. There she will stay until, one day, a hero comes to rescue her.\nThe music of the opera.\nThe music contains many wonderful moments. The most famous bit is the beginning of Act Three where the Valkyries are riding on their horses. This music is known as \"The Ride of the Valkyries\". It is very dramatic music. The very beginning of Act One is also very dramatic. The music describes a storm. The orchestra is a very large one, including special tubas which are known as \u201cWagner tubas\u201d. There are no separate arias in these operas: all the sections flows into one another. Sometimes a character has a section when they are telling a story. There are beautiful sections like the one in Act One where Siegmund is remembering about his father and the sword, or the love music between Siegmund and Sieglinde. By using leitmotifs (music which goes with certain ideas or characters) he gets many subtle effects. When Siegmund looks at the ash tree we hear the sword motive because the sword is in the tree, although at that moment he does not know about it. We also hear Wotan\u2019s theme when Siegmund talks about his father. We (the listener) know who his father is, but Siegmund does not. The music tells us lots of things that the characters in the story may not understand. This makes the music very powerful and exciting."}

{"id": "51532", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51532", "title": "Siegfried (opera)", "text": "Siegfried is an opera by Richard Wagner. It is the third of the four operas that together tell a story called \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"). The story continues from the end of the second opera which was called \"Die Walk\u00fcre\". \nThe first performance of \"Siegfried\" took place when the whole Ring cycle (all four operas) were performed in the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth on 16 August 1876.\nThe story of the opera.\nAct One.\nThe first part of the opera takes place in a forest where the giant Fafner lives. He has used the magic tarn helmet to change himself into a dragon so that he can guard the treasure of the gold and the ring (we saw how he got the treasure in the first opera, \"Das Rheingold\"). Siegfried, who was not yet born at the end of the second opera, \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", is now a young lad. He has been brought up by the dwarf Mime, Alberich's brother. Mime is just as horrible as his brother.\nMime is hammering away at the anvil, trying to repair the sword that was smashed to pieces by Wotan in Act Two of \"Die Walk\u00fcre\". He wants to make the bits into a strong sword, but every time he thinks he has managed it Siegfried picks up the sword and breaks it with his strength. The reason that Mime wants to make the sword is so that he can give it to Siegfried (who is obviously the hero who is meant to have the sword in the end) and tell him to fight the dragon. Then Mime will be able to get the ring from him so that he can have power over all the world. When Siegfried enters he brings a bear from the forest. The bear chases Mime and Siegfried laughs. Then he lets the bear go free. \nMime says to Siegfried that he should be thankful to him for looking after him as a child and bringing him up. He has never told Siegfried who his parents were (they were Siegmund and Sieglinde, both now dead). Siegfried does not understand anything about how babies are born. He has never seen a woman before. He only knows Mime who is pretending to be his father. Siegfried has noticed that young birds look like their parents and he asks Mime why he does not look like him. In the end Mime is forced to tell Siegfried about his parents and about the sword that was smashed by Wotan. Siegfried tells Mime to forge (make) the sword so that he can kill the dragon. Siegfried goes off.\nWotan, the chief god, appears. He is disguised as a wanderer. Mime says he wants to ask him three questions, and if he cannot answer them he can chop off his head. Wotan agrees. First Mime asks him the name of the race of people who live below the earth. Wotan says they are the Nibelungs. Then Mime asks who are the people who live on the earth\u2019s surface. Wotan says they are the giants. Then he asks him who lives in the sky. Wotan says they are the gods. He has answered all three questions correctly. He now tells Mime it is his turn to ask Mime three questions which he must answer if he wants to keep his head. Mime is terrified, but has to agree.\nFirst Wotan asks him who are the people whom Wotan loves a lot although he has to be harsh with them. Mime answers: the W\u00e4lsung race. Then Wotan asks him the name of the sword that Wotan left for Siegfried. Mime answers: Nothung. Finally Wotan asks him who can put the pieces of the sword together. Mime is now terrified because he does not know the answer. Wotan tells him the answer: it is the person who does not know fear. He says to Mime that he can keep his head for the moment. He will leave it to the fearless person to chop it off later.\nWhen Mime and Siegfried are together again, Mime tries to frighten Siegfried so that he knows what fear is. He tells him all about the huge dragon in the cave. \"Does that not frighten you?\" he asks him. \"Not a bit\" answers Siegfried, who likes the thought of fighting a dragon. Siegfried works at the anvil and starts to make the sword. Mime is thinking of how he will trick Siegfried after the dragon has been killed, so that he can get the sword and kill Siegfried. At last Siegfried manages to make the mighty sword. He calls out its name: \"Nothung\"! Then he crashes the sword down on the anvil which splits into two pieces.\nAct Two.\nOutside the dragon\u2019s cave Wotan, still disguised as a wanderer, meets Alberich (Mime\u2019s brother who has not been in the story since the first opera). Alberich hates Wotan for having snatched the ring from him. Wotan does not care, and even wakes the dragon up, but the dragon does not want to fight them.\nMime and Siegfried appear. Siegfried is not frightened at all. He just wants to know where the dragon\u2019s heart is so that he can kill it. Mime leaves him alone. Siegfried sits down in the forest and thinks. He is glad to know now that the ugly Mime is not his father. He hears a bird singing and he tries to imitate the bird\u2019s song with a pipe he has made from a reed. He blows his horn and the dragon appears. Siegfried plunges the sword into the dragon\u2019s heart. Siegfried instinctively puts his hand in the dragon\u2019s mouth and tastes its blood. Suddenly he can understand what the bird is saying. The bird (originally sung by a boy but normally now by a woman) tells him to take the ring and the tarn helmet (which allows the wearer to change shape or make himself invisible). He takes them.\nMime and Alberich appear. They are arguing about who shall have the ring and the tarn helmet. Siegfried appears with both. Mime offers Siegfried a drink which is drugged. The bird warns Siegfried not to drink it. Siegfried kills Mime by chopping his head off with the sword. The bird then tells Siegfried about his beautiful bride Br\u00fcnnhilde who is lying on a rock, protected by fire, waiting to be rescued by him.\nAct Three.\nErda, the wise Earth Goddess, tells Wotan about the Norns who are weaving the rope of destiny. She is surprised to hear how Wotan has punished Br\u00fcnnhilde. Wotan says he now looks forward to the end of the gods, and wants Siegfried to take his place.\nSiegfried arrives. He tells Wotan (who is a stranger to him) about his heroic deed with the dragon. He finds Wotan annoying and smashes Wotan\u2019s sword. He goes to the rock where Br\u00fcnnhilde is lying.\nSiegfried bursts through the flames and finds the sleeping Br\u00fcnnhilde. He gently takes off her helmet, then her breastplate. Suddenly he sees that she is a woman. He has never seen a woman before. For the first time in his life he is frightened, yet he very much wants to wake her up. He kisses her lips and she opens her eyes and sits up. She tells him that she has always loved him, even long before he was born. Siegfried feels his passion growing and tries to put his arms round her, but now it is Br\u00fcnnhilde who is frightened. She tells him not to spoil the purity of their love. Finally they embrace.\nThe music.\nIt took Wagner more than 15 years to write this opera which is one reason why the music of Act Three is slightly different in style. Some ideas from the love music of Siegfried and Br\u00fcnnhilde were later re-used by Wagner in a separate orchestral piece, called the \"Siegfried Idyll\". Many of the leitmotifs (musical ideas that belong to particular characters or ideas) are ones that were heard in the \"Das Rheingold\" or \"Die Walk\u00fcre\". One unusual instrument in the orchestra is the anvil. It is played when Mime, and later Siegfried, are hammering on the anvil trying to forge the pieces of the sword together. The rhythm of this music is the same rhythm heard earlier in the Nibelung scene in \"Das Rheingold\".\nWhen Wagner started working on the opera he called it \"Der junge Siegfried\" (\"The young Siegfried\") but by 1856 he had changed the title to \"Siegfried\".\nThe German word \u201cSieg\u201d means \u201cvictory\u201d and \u201cFried\u201d or \u201cFriede\u201d means \u201cpeace\u201d. It is a good name for a hero. The role of Siegfried is sung by a tenor. The singer needs a very strong voice, often called a \u201cHeldentenor\u201d in German (a \u201cheroic tenor\u201d). He is on stage for most of the opera which lasts about four hours."}

It is the fourth and last of the cycle of operas that together tell a story called \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"). The story continues from the end of the third opera which was called \"Siegfried\". \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" is the German name for \"Ragnar\u00f6k\".\n\"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" is the longest of the four operas. It takes about five hours to perform. It consists of a prologue and three acts. Wagner finished composing the opera in the autumn of 1874. It was first performed on 17 August 1876 as part of the complete Ring cycle.\nThe story of the opera.\nThe Prologue.\nThe three Norns, daughters of Erda the Earth Goddess, are spinning the rope of destiny. This rope is a symbol of what has to happen in the end. They take it in turns to tell the story of the past, spinning as they sing and passing on the rope to the next one. The first Norn tells how Wotan went to drink from the Well of Wisdom for which he lost an eye. He then cut a spear from a tree which then died. The second Norn tells how a young hero broke Wotan\u2019s spear and how the gods were sent from Valhalla to chop down the World Ash. The third Norn tells how the logs from the ash tree have been piled round Valhalla ready for a fire that will burn everything. The Norns have visions of the future. The rope breaks. The Norns disappear into the earth.\nBr\u00fcnnhilde and Siegfried come out of a cave by the rock where they were left at the end of the third opera. Siegfried has to go off to do heroic deeds. He gives Br\u00fcnnhilde the ring as a token of his love for her. She gives him her horse which is called Grane (pronounce: GRAH-ne). Siegfried travels down the river Rhine.\nAct One.\nAct One takes place in the Hall of the Gibichung palace. Gunther is the chief of the Gibichungs. His half-brother Hagen tells him he would look more important if he got married. He also says that Gunther\u2019s sister Gutrune ought to get married. He tells him about Br\u00fcnnhilde who, he thinks, is still asleep on the rock surrounded by fire that no one except Siegfried would be able to get through. He says that if they manage to get Siegfried to marry Gutrune, then she could persuade him to go and catch Br\u00fcnnhilde for Gunther. He says that they could give Siegfried a potion (a special drink) which would make him forget that he loved Br\u00fcnnhilde.\nThey hear Siegfried\u2019s horn outside and the great hero arrives. Siegfried asks Hagen whether he knows him. Of course, Hagen does. Siegfried is carrying the magic tarn helmet which allows a person to change their shape or become invisible. Siegfried, however, does not know what the tarn helmet can do, and Hagen has to explain it to him. Gutrune appears and offers Siegfried a drink. It is the potion which is going to make him forget any other woman. He drinks to the health of Br\u00fcnnhilde. As soon as he has drunk it he looks at Gutrune and is in love with her. He agrees to marry her, and he agrees to get a wife for Gunther. Hagen tells him about Br\u00fcnnhilde on the rock. Siegfried has forgotten about her. He agrees to put on the tarn helmet and disguise himself as Gunther and to go and get Br\u00fcnnhilde. He goes off, leaving Hagen guarding the palace.\nThe next scene takes place on the top of the Valkyrie rock. Her sister Waltraute arrives on a flying horse. She says that Wotan (their father, the chief God) returned to Valhalla with his spear broken. She says he told the gods to pile up the logs from the World Ash for a fire which will burn everything. Wotan desperately wants the ring to be given back to the Rhine Maidens (who were guardians of the gold, from which the ring was forged, in the first opera). Br\u00fcnnhilde refuses to give her the ring that Siegfried had given her as a token of their love. Waltraute disappears.\nAfter the weather calms the flames flicker again. Siegfried arrives, disguised as Gunther. Br\u00fcnnhilde is horrified to see a person she thinks is a stranger. Siegfried says she is his bride, forces the ring from her finger and drags her into a cave for the night, although placing the sword between them.\nAct Two.\nBack at the palace Alberich tries to persuade his son Hagen to get the ring. Hagen wants to get the ring, but only for himself. Siegfried arrives. He no longer wears the tarn helmet so he looks like himself. Hagen blows his horn to call his vassals (soldiers) for a celebration. Gunther is to marry Br\u00fcnnhilde and Siegfried is to marry Gutrune. Br\u00fcnnhilde cannot understand why Siegfried is doing this. She sees the ring on his finger and asks him how he got it, as she thinks Gunther snatched it from her. Siegfried says that he won it by killing a dragon. He tells people how he tricked Br\u00fcnnhilde and swears that a sword lay between them during the night, although Br\u00fcnnhilde tries to make people think otherwise.\nBr\u00fcnnhilde is left alone with Gunther and Hagen. She tells them that, although Siegfried is so strong and impossible to kill in battle, he has one weak spot on his back. Gunther does not like the idea of having Siegfried killed, but Hagen promises him that he can then have the ring. They decide to kill Siegfried and to tell Gutrune that he was killed by a wild boar.\nAct Three.\nThe last act takes place in a wild forest. Siegfried\u2019s hunting horn is heard, and then the hunting horn of the Gibichungs. By the river Siegfried happens to meet the Rhine Maidens and teases them by showing them the ring, but does not let them have it. They tell him about the curse on the ring but Siegfried does not believe them. He meets Hagen. They drink together. Siegfried tells the men all about his life, how he was brought up by Mime, about the sword, the dragon and the bird singing. Then he cannot remember any more. Hagen gives him another drugged drink which makes him start to remember what actually happened. He remembers Br\u00fcnnhilde and how he found her surrounded by fire. He gradually realizes how he has been tricked and feels unbearable sadness. Two ravens fly overhead and Hagen plunges his spear into Siegfried\u2019s back. He dies while speaking the name of Br\u00fcnnhilde. His body is carried off to a funeral march.\nBack at the palace his body is brought in. Gutrune accuses Gunther of murdering him, but Gunther says Hagen did it. Hagen says he did it because Siegfried, when disguised as Gunther, had slept with Br\u00fcnnhilde. He tries to snatch the ring from the dead Siegfried\u2019s finger, Gunther tries to stop him but is murdered by Hagen. He tries again to snatch the ring but to everybody\u2019s horror the arm of the dead hero rises in the air.\nBr\u00fcnnhilde enters and tells everyone how she promised Siegfried her love. Gutrune curses Hagen and falls onto her brother\u2019s dead body. Br\u00fcnnhilde orders a funeral pyre (a fire) to be prepared. She sings to Wotan that Siegfried is now at peace in death and that she understands more now. She takes the ring and promises to return it to the Rhine Maidens. She lights the fire which flares up and she rides on her horse Grane into the flames. The whole building catches fire, and the Rhine overflows and puts it out. Hagen jumps into the water trying to get the ring from the Rhine Maidens who drown him and finally take it back. The flood dies down and Valhalla (the gods\u2019 palace) is lit up by the fire. The gods and the heroes die in the flames. The Twilight of the Gods has happened and Br\u00fcnnhilde has redeemed the world with her love.\nThe music.\nThe music of this long opera is extremely cleverly linked so that musical ideas flow into one another and combine to comment on the drama. Many of the themes have been heard in the other three operas. It is a very exhausting opera to sing, especially for Br\u00fcnnhilde. There are usually two long intervals during a performance. The orchestra is very large and includes eight harps."}
{"id": "51536", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51536", "title": "Der Ring des Nibelungen", "text": "Der Ring des Nibelungen (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\" (Alberich)) is a cycle of four operas by Richard Wagner. \nStories.\nThe story of each opera can be found in the separate articles.\nSometimes it is known as a \u201ctetralogy\u201d meaning: four works that belong together.\nWagner took the story of the operas from a book called the \"Nibelungenlied\" (the \"Nibelung Song\") which was written in the 12th century by a German poet. We do not know the name of the poet. The story is about the ancient gods from German mythology.\nComposition.\nWagner made a lot of changes to the story in order to make it suitable for his four operas. Wagner\u2019s story tells of a hoard of gold which is being guarded by the Rhinemaidens. The dwarf Alberich steals the gold and uses some of it to make a ring which makes the owner powerful over all the world. When Wotan, the chief god, steals it from him, Alberich puts a curse on the ring. The ring will bring death to whoever has it. The ring goes through the hands of several characters, all of whom die in the end.\nAlberich belongs to a race of dwarfs called the \u201cNibelungs\u201d. The word \u201cNibelungen\u201d in the title of the cycle: \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\u201cThe Ring of the Nibelung\u201d), refers to Alberich (it is singular, not plural).\nThe story of Wagner\u2019s Ring cycle sounds quite fantastic and strange, like a fairy tale. Although the characters seems very different from real people, the story tells us all about basic human emotions. It is a story about greed, love, lust, intrigue etc. This is what makes it so powerful.\nWagner\u2019s music matches each character and situation beautifully. It develops continuously: there are no breaks in the music during the acts. Wagner used what he called leitmotifs (leading motives). These are tunes or chords or little musical phrases which are linked to particular people in the opera. In this way he can hint at things very cleverly in the music. For example: there is a leitmotiv for the curse. Whenever we hear this curse motive we know that the curse of the ring is working.\nWagner spent about twenty years writing the Ring cycle. He started in the 1850s when he was living in Switzerland. He wrote all the libretto (the words) himself, as he always did for his operas. By 1857 he had finished the first two operas and two thirds of \"Siegfried\". It was many years later that he finally finished \"Siegfried\" and wrote the final opera as well.\nOpera house.\nWagner wanted to have the Ring cycle performed in a special opera house which would be built in the way he wanted. He needed a lot of money for his ideas, and he was very lucky to find someone who adored his music and was happy to give him a lot of money. This was King Ludwig II of Bavaria (sometimes called the \u201cmad king of Bavaria\u201d because he did become insane). Wagner told the King that the Ring cycle would be performed in Munich which was the capital city of Bavaria. Later, when it seemed impossible to build a new opera house there, Wagner broke his promise and built his opera house in Bayreuth instead. The King did not seem to mind and still gave him lots of money for the project as well as a nice house to live in. \"Das Rheingold\" was first performed in Munich in 1869 and \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" in 1870. The whole Ring cycle was first performed in 1876 in the new opera house called the \"Festspielhaus\" in Bayreuth."}

V\u00e4ki could sometimes be seen. They looked like little man-like creatures. Sometimes V\u00e4ki went inside people and made people ill. V\u00e4ki makes people ill if they behave badly in their kingdom. For example, if someone shouted in a forest without reason then the V\u00e4ki of forest may make then ill.

It was released on September 7, 2008 in America, and September 5 in Europe.\nInitially, it was going to be 6 different phases, but they merged the city and civilization phases, so it's only 5 phases now.\nOne of the biggest parts of the game is the different editors. Almost all things in the game can be made by the player, from buildings in the civilization phase to the creature in the creature phase. The player uses different parts that he can place as he wants. He can also change things like size and \"stretch\" the parts. All these things made by players can be uploaded as pictures to the \"sporepedia\". A picture has all the info needed for the game to make the thing, and is very small in size, usually less than 30 kilobytes. This means, that a player can find a picture of a car made in Spore that he likes, copy it, and put it in the Spore folder. Then they can play with it.\nAll the different phases of the game offer many choices. Roughly, the player can choose to be peaceful, aggressive, or both. For example, in the creature phase, there is a choice to eat other animals, just fruit, or both. And in the civilization phase, there is a choice to be military, religious, economic, or a little of all of them. "}

Both names are from the Germanic root \"lind\". The modern forms in English went from \"linde\" or \"linne\" in Anglo Saxon and old Norse, and in Britain the word transformed more recently to the modern British form \"lime\". In the United States, the modern German name \"Linde\", from the same root, became more common, partly to avoid confusion with any other uses of the name.\n\"Tilia\" species are large deciduous trees, reaching typically between 20m and 40m tall, some species grow as shrubs. Plants of this genus are found through the north temperate regions.\nHistory.\nThe Germanic tribes associated the Linden tree with the goddess Freya. Very often, these tribes held their assemblies, called Thing near or under such a tree. Often, trees that were standing alone somewhere were chosen. These assemblies were used to make laws. They usually lasted three days.\nUses.\nThe tree produces fragrant and nectar-producing flowers, the medicinal herb lime blossom. They are very important honey plants for beekeepers, producing a very pale but richly flavoured monofloral honey. The flowers are also used for herbal tea, and this infusion is particularly popular in Europe."}

It is also called the \"rectangular coordinate system\". The numbers are usually called the formula_1 \"coordinate\" and the formula_2 \"coordinate\". To find the coordinates of a point, two perpendicular lines, called \"axes\" (singular: \"axis\"), are drawn. The point where the axes meet is the coordinate origin, written (0,0). The formula_1 \"coordinate\" gives the position of a point measured along the formula_1 axis, and the formula_2 \"coordinate\" gives the position along the formula_2 axis. Cartesian coordinates can be used in three dimensions (3D), by adding a third number, the formula_7 \"coordinate\". In four dimensions (4D), a fourth number, the formula_8 \"coordinate\", is added. Each coordinate represents a dimension of space.\nUsing the Cartesian coordinate system, many shapes, like straight lines and parabolas can be described by using algebraic equations. The results of the equations can be seen by plotting (drawing) a point for each solution to the equations. For example, the formula_1 axis is described by the equation formula_10. A circle having radius formula_11 and centered at the origin can be described with the equation formula_12 (see Figure 2).\nThe name Cartesian comes from the French mathematician and philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes (Latin: \"Cartesius\"), who worked to merge algebra and Euclidean geometry. This work was important in creating calculus and cartography.\nThe idea of this system was developed in 1637 in two works by Descartes. In part two of his \"Discourse on Method\", Descartes explains plotting the position of a point or object on a surface, using two perpendicular axes as measuring guides. In \"La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\" (\"Geometry\"), he further explores these ideas."}
{"id": "51722", "revid": "103847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51722", "title": "Polar coordinate system", "text": "In mathematics, the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.\nThe polar coordinate system is especially useful in situations where the relationship between two points is most easily expressed with angles and distance; in the more familiar Cartesian or rectangular coordinate system, such a relationship can only be found through trigonometric formulae.\nAs the coordinate system is two-dimensional, each point is determined by two polar coordinates: the radial coordinate and the angular coordinate. The radial coordinate (usually denoted as formula_1) denotes the point's distance from a central point known as the \"pole\" (equivalent to the \"origin\" in the Cartesian system). The angular coordinate (also known as the polar angle or the azimuth angle, and usually denoted by \u03b8 or formula_2) denotes the positive or anticlockwise (counterclockwise) angle required to reach the point from the 0\u00b0 ray or \"polar axis\" (which is equivalent to the positive x-axis in the Cartesian coordinate plane).\nHistory.\nThe concepts of angle and radius were already used by ancient peoples of the 1st millennium BCE. Hipparchus (190-120 BCE) created a table of chord functions giving the length of the chord for each angle, and there are references to his using polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions.\nIn \"On Spirals,\" Archimedes describes the Archimedean spiral, a function whose radius depends on the angle. The Greek work, however, did not extend to a full coordinate system.\nThere are various accounts of the introduction of polar coordinates as part of a formal coordinate system. The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's \"Origin of Polar Coordinates.\" Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.\nIn \"Method of Fluxions\" (written 1671, published 1736), Sir Isaac Newton examined the transformations between polar coordinates, which he referred to as the \"Seventh Manner; For Spirals\", and nine other coordinate systems. In the journal \"Acta Eruditorum\" (1691), Jacob Bernoulli used a system with a point on a line, called the \"pole\" and \"polar axis\" respectively. Coordinates were specified by the distance from the pole and the angle from the \"polar axis\". Bernoulli's work extended to finding the radius of curvature of curves expressed in these coordinates.\nThe actual term \"polar coordinates\" has been attributed to Gregorio Fontana and was used by 18th-century Italian writers. The term appeared in English in George Peacock's 1816 translation of Lacroix's \"Differential and Integral Calculus\". Alexis Clairaut was the first to think of polar coordinates in three dimensions, and Leonhard Euler was the first to actually develop them.\nConverting between polar and Cartesian coordinates.\nThe polar coordinates \"r\" and \"\u03c6\" can be converted to the Cartesian coordinates \"x\" and \"y\" by using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine:\nThe Cartesian coordinates \"x\" and \"y\" can be converted to polar coordinates \"r\" and \"\u03c6\" with \"r\"\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 and \"\u03c6\" in the interval (\u2212, ] by:\nCylindrical coordinates.\nCylindrical coordinates take the same idea that polar coordinates use, but they extend it further. To get a third dimension, each point also has a \"height\" above the original coordinate system. Each point is uniquely identified by a distance to the origin, called \"r\" here, an angle, called \"formula_5\" (\"phi\"), and a height above the plane of the coordinate system, called \"Z\" in the picture.\nSpherical coordinates.\nThe same idea as is used by polar coordinates can also be extended in a different way. Instead of using two distances, and one angle only, it is possible to use one distance only, and two angles, called formula_5 and formula_7 (\"theta\")."}

{"id": "51746", "revid": "1050767", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51746", "title": "Singing", "text": "Singing means making music with the voice. Singing is probably the way that music started many thousands of years ago. When people sing they make their voices go high or low. If they do this in a way that uses notes of a scale then they make tunes, called songs. A song, very broadly, is a musical piece, produced by the voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns of sound and silence and a variety which often includes repetition.\nMany birds also sing. They are the passerines, a very large order often called the songbirds. \nSinging technique.\nWhen people sing they use the air in the lungs. The pressure of the air that comes out of the lungs can be controlled with several respiratory muscles, including the muscle called the diaphragm which goes across the front of the body below the ribs. People who have singing lessons spend a lot of time practising \u201cbreath control\u201d.\nThe air comes through the throat where the larynx is like a reed on a clarinet: it vibrates, controlling the passage of air, and this makes the note higher or lower depending on how it is controlled.\nThe sound comes into the mouth which is space where the sound can be made bigger (it \u201cresonates\u201d). Professional singers even learn to think of the whole head as a resonator. They sometimes talk about the \u201cmask\u201d, i.e. they imagine a mask in front of the face and this makes the sound bigger. The sound then comes out of the mouth so that it can be heard.\nSinging is different from speaking because of the special way the vocal cords in the throat are used.\nVoice ranges.\nMost people can sing notes which cover more than an octave. People who sing a lot will probably be able to sing over two octaves. Singers can be called according to whether they have higher or lower voices: soprano, mezzo-soprano and contralto for women, tenor, baritone or bass for men. Some men are able to train their voices to sing alto by using a falsetto voice. Children\u2019s voices are often called treble.\nTypes of singing.\nThere are lots of different singing styles in the world. Each one has a different technique. In Western classical music singers learn to sing in a bel canto voice which uses lots of resonance in the head and makes a smooth sound. Bel canto was used in Italian opera. Later, in the 19th century, Richard Wagner wrote operas in which the singers needed to be more dramatic. Opera singers today can have different kinds of voices: bel canto, lyrical, dramatic, coloratura (extremely high and light) etc.\nIn church choirs the singers are often trained to use a lot of head voice because this sounds beautiful in large cathedrals.\nPop singers generally have a different technique: their singing is more from the throat. They do not need to develop powerful voices like opera singers because they sing into microphones so that their voices are electronically amplified (made louder).\nVoices singing music from different parts of the world may sound very different. Chinese singing sounds nasal (through the nose). In Mongolia there is a technique of overtone singing which sounds rather like a finger being rubbed against the rim of a wineglass. In Switzerland men often yodel.\nRap is a kind of singing in which the rhythm is the most important thing. The pitch is high and low, but not to any particular notes. Scat singing is rather like rap.\nAcappella singing is vocal music specifically without instrumental accompaniment. The name is from Latin \"a\" (without) and \"cappella\" (musical accompaniment).\nCantata is a term that exclusively refers to accompanied singing, which is the exact opposite of Acappella.\nWays to enjoy singing.\nSinging is something that can be enjoyed by everybody. A group of people singing together is often called a choir. People can sing in choirs or smaller groups or on their own (solos). People can sing for their own enjoyment (e.g. in the shower), or they can practise hard and sing in concerts to an audience.\nSinging can be done alone (\"a cappella\") or it can be \"accompanied\" (usually with musical instruments).\nSome people say they are \u201ctone-deaf\u201d, meaning that they cannot sing in tune. But almost everybody can learn to sing if they try hard enough."}

They have a common history with other Baptist movements, such as the Mennonites.\nThe Amish are known for simple lifestyle, plain dress, and reluctance to adopt many conveniences of modern technology. The history of the Amish church began with a schism in Switzerland within a group of Swiss and Alsatian Anabaptists in 1693 led by Jakob Ammann. Those who followed Ammann became known as Amish. In the second half of the 19th century, the Amish divided into Old Order Amish and Amish Mennonites. During the 20th century, the Amish Mennonites assimilated, and took several of the conveniences modern technology has to offer. The Old Order Amish on the other hand, kept much of their traditional culture. When people speak of Amish today, they usually mean the Old Order Amish. There were other smaller splits as well. At the end of the 20th century, there were about 18 bigger groups of Amish.\nMany of them emigrated to the United States. Today, most of the Amish live in Pennsylvania (Lancaster County), Indiana and Ohio, in the United States. This can still be seen with family names. In Lancaster County, almost 25 percent of the Amish have the name Stoltzfus (or Stoltzfoos), other common Amish names are Byler, Fisher, Petersheim, Lapp and King. In LaGrange, Indiana, most are named Borntrager, Miller or Schrock. In Allen County, Adams County, Indiana the names Graber, Grabill/Kraybill and Schwartz are common.\nMany Amish people prefer simple lifestyles. They are usually farmers. Many of the old order Amish saw that between the two world wars, cars became more common. This automatic mobility weakened the sense of belonging together, and owning a car was a means to stand out from the community. For this reason, many groups forbid car ownership, they are less sceptical about using a car. Amish often live alongside other Engilsh settlers. In areas, where there are many Amish, there is also a number of taxi services, who will drive Amish people around.\nMany Amish settlements are not connected to the electricity network. When they need electricity, they usually produce it themselves, often with diesel-powered engines. Many Amish do not allow posing for photographs; they say it is against their sense of humility and not standing out from the others. They are usually less strict about appearing on a photograph, where the person is not the subject of the picture).\nGenerally, they are friendly people in that they will wave to someone passing by. However, they live in rural Amish communities which are separate from mainstream American society. It is against their religion to pose for photographs. Often they will turn their head down and to the side if someone aims a camera in their direction.\nMarried men are not allowed to shave their beards, but they are also not allowed to have moustaches. Only unmarried men shave their faces.\nAmish characters are in the movie Witness, starring Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis.\nAmish education and language.\nMany of the people who emigrated kept their language, which is a dialect of German and known as Pennsylvania German or Pennsylvania Dutch. In 2012, it was estimated that there were between 350.000 and 420.000 speakers of Pennsilvania German. Pennsylvania German was relatively common until the time before the Second World War, with an estimate of about 800.000 speakers. During the war, people frowned upon German speakers, so many speakers did not teach the language to their children. Only conservative Baptists, such as Amish and Mennonites withstood the pressure, and sill taught the language to their children.\nAfter the Second World War, the Amish started to run their own schools, where they teach their children, how to read, write, and calculate. Very often, they also learn German, to be able to read the religious texts. Subjects such as natural sciences, such as biology are not taught at school.\nAmish dating.\nAmish dating is different between different communities and different churches. In most communities the common thing to do would be: have some other guy go ask the girl (preferably someone related to her) if it is OK for them to date. If she says it is OK he sees her home (from their Sunday night thing, called a \"Singeon\", which normally ends at 10:30-11:30\u00a0p.m.) and stays at her house till a certain time, some communities midnight, some 1:00\u00a0a.m., and others anywhere between 1:00\u00a0a.m. and 5:00\u00a0a.m. Some communities they sit on each other's lap, others aren't allowed to touch each other, while still others are allowed to kiss. Dating really varies between different types of \"Amish\"."}

During the Battle of Trafalgar, his greatest victory, he was killed by a French sniper.\nLast words.\nAt least three versions of his last words exist, and are shown in \"wikiquote\". \nHis most well-known last words are, \"Kiss me, Hardy\".\nAnother statement during his last hours was, \"Thank God I have done my duty.\"\nAlternatively, he may have said both of these statements; \"Kiss me, Hardy\" and Hardy kissed him on the cheek. Then Nelson said, \"Now I am satisfied. Thank God I have done my duty.\" Then Hardy kissed him again on the forehead and Nelson called out, \"Who is that?\" Hardy replied, \"It is Hardy.\" Then Nelson said, \"God bless you, Hardy.\" Then he murmoured to those around him to look about Emma Hamilton and his daughter.\nMost recently are accounts of his chaplain, Alexander Scott; his steward, Chevalier; and the purser, Walter Burke. \"Drink, drink. Fan, fan. Rub, rub\" was a request to ease his symptoms of thirst, heat, and the pains of his wounds. \nScott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as 'God and my country'."}

It may be a connected set of ideas, or a style of thought, or a world-view. It was coined by a French philosopher, Destutt de Tracy in 1801/5.\nThere are two main types of ideologies: \"political ideologies\", and \"epistemological ideologies\". Political ideologies are sets of ethical ideas about how a country should be run. Epistemological ideologies are sets of ideas about the philosophy, the Universe, and how people should make decisions.\nThere are many different types of ideologies. Communism, socialism, and capitalism are political/economical ideologies.\nMany political parties base their political action and program on an ideology. In social studies, a political ideology is a certain ethical set of values, principles, doctrines, myths, or symbols of a social movement, institution, or class which explains how society should work. It offers a political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends it should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them.\nPolitical ideologies have two dimensions:\nAn ideology is a collection of ideas. Typically, each ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers to be the best form of government (e.g. democracy, theocracy, etc.), and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism, socialism, etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, \"socialism\" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology which supports that economic system.\nIdeologies also identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum (such as the left, the center or the right), though this is very often controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g. populism) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. legalization of marijuana). \nToday, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age, in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed. This is often associated with Francis Fukuyama's writings on \"the end of history\"."}

It was commonly called the \"Persian Gulf War\" until Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The Iraq-Kuwait war, which the United States entered, later was called the \"Persian Gulf War\" or the \"Gulf War\".\nThe war began when Iraq invaded Iran on 22 September 1980, after a long history of border disputes and demands for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. Iraqi forces did well at the beginning of the war, taking Iranian Khuzestan, but before long they were stopped and forced out of Iran. The war continued for years, and neither side gained much ground in the resulting trench warfare. About a million soldiers died and a similar number of civilians. Both sides used blockade, which other countries opposed. Despite several calls for an end to the fighting by the United Nations Security Council, the two countries fought until 20 August 1988; the last prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003. The war changed politics in the Middle East and worldwide.\nThe Iran\u2013Iraq War is also noted for Iraq's use of chemical weapons and biological weapons against Iranian troops and civilians. The role of the United States and Soviet Union was very important, dating back to the Cold War. In 1953, the US encouraged a coup d'\u00e9tat against Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was the Prime Minister of Iran. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi returned to power, supporting his military and his government. The United States sold many weapons to the Shah's government. Meanwhile, revolutionaries of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party overthrew the king of Iraq and, with the help of the Soviet Union, built up their army. Starting with the United Arab Republic, they sought to unite all the Arabs into one state, including the Arab minority in Iran.\nAfter the war started, (especially between 1983 and 1988) the United States sold weapons to the Iraqis. This move was largely due to America's interest in containing the revolutionary Ayatollah Khomeini. Thus, both the Soviet Union and the United States supplied Iraq with weapons to use against Iran. The United States had sold many weapons to Iran before the war. it was believed the soviet union was selling weapons to both sides during the war."}

The Cavalera brothers chose this name after translating English band Motorhead's song called \"Dancing On Your Grave\".\nSinger Wagner Lamounier and bass player Paulo Jr. were the first stable members to join the band along the Cavaleras. Lamounier left after a year and Max decided to sing as well as play guitar. The band added a second guitar player named Jairo Guedez. These members recorded their first album \"Morbid Visions\" in 1986. The song \"Troops of Doom\" from this album gave the band a small amount of popularity.\nGuedez left after the album was released, being replaced by Andreas Kisser. This line-up lasted until 1996 and accomplished several things. They recorded five more albums, where they began to play a more thrash metal sound than death/black metal in the first three albums, Schizophrenia (1987), Beneath The Remains (1989) and Arise (1991), and then moved on to groove metal with the last two of these five albums, Chaos A.D. (1993) and Roots (1996). Popular songs from the Chaos A.D. include Refuse/Resist and Roots Bloody Roots. On Roots, they also included a song they recorded with the Brazilian Xavantes tribe called Itsari, who also toured with them.\nConflicts between Max and the other members led to Max leaving the band. He was replaced with American singer Derrick Green. Although the band's album sales have lowered with each album released with Green, he remains in the group today, having recorded the albums Against (1998), Nation (2001), Roorback (2003), Dante XXI (2006), A-Lex (2009) and Kairos (2011) with the band.\nIgor Cavalera left the band in 2006 after Dante XXI.

The 14th and current Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso.\nBetween the 17th century and 1959, the Dalai Lama was the head of the Tibetan government. During winter, the Dalai Lamas stayed in the Potala palace. In summer they were in the Norbulingka palace. These two palaces are both in Lhasa, Tibet. In 1959, the Dalai Lama had to flee from Tibet to Dharamsala, India. This is still his base today.\nThe current Dalai Lama is His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso.\nDalai Lama is the title of Tibetan Buddhism leader. \"Dalai\" is original from Mongolian which means \"ocean\" and \"Lama\" is original from Tibetan which means \"the highest principle\". In 1653, during the Qing Dynasty, this title was authorized to Dalai Lama V by the Chinese Emperor for the first time.\nModern history.\nThe 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, expelled all Chinese civilians from the country, and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet. These included provisions to curb excessive demands on peasants and tax evasion by the nobles, setting up an independent police force, the abolishment of the death penalty, extension of secular education, and the provision of electricity throughout the city of Lhasa in the 1920s. Thubten Gyatso died in 1933.\nThe 14th Dalai Lama was not formally enthroned until 17 November 1950, during the People's Republic of China invasion of Tibet (1950\u20131951). Fearing for his life, the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India where he has led a government-in-exile since. With the aim of launching guerrilla operations against the Chinese, the Central Intelligence Agency funded the Dalai Lama $1.7 million a year in the 1960s. In 2001, he gave up his absolute power over the government to an elected parliament of selected Tibetan exiles. His original goal was full independence for Tibet, but by the late 1980s, he was seeking high-level autonomy instead. He is still seeking greater autonomy from China, although Dolma Gyari, deputy speaker of the parliament-in-exile has stated \"If the middle path fails in the short term, we will be forced to opt for complete independence or selfdetermination as per the UN charter\"."}

It was written and directed by Joss Whedon. The movie takes place in the fictional universe of the cancelled FOX science fiction television series \"Firefly\". It takes place about two months after the final episode, \"Objects in Space\". That is 500 years in the future.\n\"Serenity\" is the story of the captain and crew of a transport and cargo spacecraft. The captain and first mate fought together on the losing side of the Unification War. Their lives of small crime are interrupted by a passenger with mental abilities who has a dangerous secret.\nThe movie was released in North America on September 30, 2005 by Universal Pictures. It received good reviews. It made $10.1 million during its first weekend. The movie made $25.5 million in the United States and $13.3 million in other countries.\nFans call the movie the \"Big Damn Movie\" (\"BDM\"). This is a reference to a line from the \"Firefly\" episode \"Safe\" in which Mal and Zoe call themselves \"big damn heroes\" after rescuing River and Simon.\nProduction.\nThe movie is based on \"Firefly\", a television series that was cancelled by Fox in December 2002. Fox stopped the show after 11 of its 14 episodes had been shown. After trying to get another network to show the series, creator Joss Whedon tried to sell it as a movie. He was introduced to Mary Parent with Universal Pictures, who agreed to make the movie after watching the episodes on DVD.\nAfter Universal Studios got the movie rights to \"Firefly\" from Fox, Whedon began writing the screenplay. Universal wanted to start making the movie in October of 2003 but problems with the script made them have to wait until June of 2004 to start of shooting the movie. Universal did not want to spend the normal amount of money for a story set in space ($100 million). Whedon told them he could do it for less. He also told them he could do it in 50 days, instead of the usual 80 days. On March 3, 2004 the movie was greenlighted to start being made. It was shown to have budget of only $40 million.\nThey started filming the movie on June 3 2004. Joss Whedon said that the movie would be called \"Serenity\" to keep it separate from the TV series. All nine of the main actors from the television series (Adam Baldwin, Alan Tudyk, Gina Torres, Jewel Staite, Morena Baccarin, Nathan Fillion, Ron Glass, Sean Maher, and Summer Glau) returned for the movie. On September 17 2004, Joss Whedon said on the movie's official site that shooting was done.\nWhedon had to take a television series that not many people had seen and explain the idea of the movie. He had to do this without boring the audience or the fans of the television series. He did this by doing things in the beginning of the movie. At first, it is a just a voice telling what has happened. It then is shown to be a school room where the voice was that of the teacher. They next showed that this was all just memories in one of the character's mind.\nSince the budget was not very large, physical special effects were used as much as possible. They made as sets and props as they could to use less CGI effects. The most technically challenging scene was the mule skiff chase. Because it would cost too much, a gimbal (a hydraulic turntable) and CGI, like the pod race scene in \"\" could not be used. The production team to find other ways to do things. They built a trailer connected to the \"hover craft\" in the movie and shot the scene while riding up a highway north of Santa Clarita. \"Serenity\" visual effects supervisor Loni Peristere said in a Los Angeles Times article: \"Traditionally this would have been, like, a 30-day shoot. I think we did it in five.\"\nOne item from the television show that could not be used again was the original set of the inside of the ship \"Serenity\". It had to be built for the movie, using images from the \"Firefly\" DVD set. The company that did the graphics for the series also had to change the computer model of \"Serenity\". The television model was not good enough for high-definition cinema screens and HD DVD.\nSynopsis.\nFive hundred years into the future, mankind has left Earth. All the people moved to a new large star system. The system is controlled by the Alliance. Away from the \"core planets\" people like the crew of the cargo ship \"Serenity\" can make a living if they stay away from Alliance ships and the Reavers - space-faring cannibals who raid the planets of \"the Rim.\" One of the Alliance's projects is the creation of a group of warriors with mental powers. The star of this project is teenager River Tam. After her older brother Simon rescues her, the Alliance Parliament sends \"The Operative\", a man with no name, rank or official existence after them.\nAbout eight months after River and Simon have joined \"Serenity's\" crew, the ship's captain Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds takes River with him to rob a bank. While they are robbing the bank, Reavers attack. After they escape back to \"Serenity\", Simon argues with Mal. Mal decides to leave Simon and River at their next stop. While at their next stop, River starts a fight that is started by a subliminal message broadcast by the Alliance in a commercial. Mal lets Simon and River keep traveling on \"Serenity\" while the crew talks to a techno-geek known as Mr. Universe. Mr. Universe lives on a planet inside a giant cloud of objects in space that does not let people see there is a planet there. Mr. Universe watches a video of the fight and finds the subliminal message. He also sees that River said the name \"Miranda.\" Mal gets a call from Inara, a former passenger. He knows it is a trap, but also knows that she must be in danger. Mal goes to her. He is confronted by the Operative. The Operative tells Mal that he will let him go if Mal turns River over to him. Mal refuses and they escape from the Operative and go back to \"Serenity\". The crew finds out that \"Miranda\" is an unknown planet near the edge of the solar system. To get to Miranda, they would have to cross into Reaver territory. They think this is too dangerous. \"Serenity\" instead goes to Haven which is home to another former passenger, Shepherd Book. When they get to Haven, the crew sees that it has been attacked by the Alliance. They also see that Shepherd Book was hurt very bad and dying. The Operative sends a message saying he did it. He said he will keep doing things like it until River is given to him.\nMal orders that \"Serenity\" be made to look like a Reaver ship. They get the disguised ship through a fleet of Reaver warships. When they get to Miranda, the crew finds everyone that lived there is dead. There are dead bodies everywhere but they can not tell how the people died. The crew finds a video made after the disaster by an Alliance ship. It tells them that the Alliance made a chemical that was susposed to stop aggression and make the planet free of violence. The chemical worked so well that the people stopped doing everything, including eating, and let themselves die. In a tenth of a percent of the people, the chemical had the opposite effect. It turned them very aggressive and caused mental problems: they became the Reavers. Mal wanted to show this secret to all the worlds by using Mr. Universe's equipment. The Operative figures out where they are going and waits just outside of Reaver space with an Alliance fleet. Knowing that the Operative is likely to be waiting for them, \"Serenity\" opens fire on one of the Reaver ships while coming back. The other Reaver ships chase after them. \"Serenity\" leaves Reaver space and pass through the cloud around Mr. Universe's planet while being chased by the entire Reaver fleet. There is a large fight between the Alliance and the Reavers. The fight lets \"Serenity's\" pilot Wash to fly down to the planet. The Operative's ship is destroyed, and he also goes to the planet in an escape pod.\n\"Serenity\" crashes on the planet. While the ship is damaged very badly, the crew has survived. Just as everyone begins to relax, a Reaver harpoon hits Wash, and kills him. The crew leaves \"Serenity\" and finds a place to fight off the Reavers while Mal goes to get to Mr. Universe and send the message. Mal finds Mr. Universe has been killed and his equipment is destroyed. He finds a message that tells him about a hidden backup transmitter. The Reavers attack the crew, and make them move back. The crew tries to close a blast door, but it will not shut all the way. River dives through the hole in the door and closes it from the other side. This traps her with the Reavers. Mal gets to the other transmitter. The Operative gets there also and they fight. Mal wins but does not kill the Operative. He leaves him to watch the video from Miranda as it is being broadcast. Mal goes back to his crew. As he is told what River did, the blast door opens to reveal River standing unhurt on an large pile of dead Reavers. A group of Alliance soldiers show up but the Operative orders them not to fight because of what he has seen on the video. The crew buried their dead and fixed \"Serenity\". \"Serenity\" leaves the planet with Mal in Wash's seat as the pilot, and River as his copilot.\nThemes.\nWhile the movie shows the Alliance as an all-powerful regime, Whedon is careful to point out that it is not that simple. \"The Alliance isn't some evil empire\", he says, but a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance\u2019s main problem is that it cannot and should not try to control all the different cultures that are a part of it. The crew of Serenity, and specifically Mal, show the idea that people should have the right to chose for themselves, even if those choices are bad.\nThe Operative is all that the Alliance stands for. He is, as Whedon described, the \"perfect product of what's wrong with the Alliance\". He is someone who is a force for good, who wants to help make his (and the Alliance's) image of a \"world without sin.\" The Operative believes so much in this idea that he do anything to make create that world . Mal is the opposite. At the movie's beginning, he is a man who has lost all faith. By the end of the movie, however, Mal finally believes in something\u2014freedom of choice\u2014so strongly that he is willing to die to preserve it. Whedon has said that the most important line in the movie is Mal's to the Operative at its end: \"I'm going to show you a world without sin.\" Whedon's point is that a world without sin is a world without choice, and that choice is what defines humanity. The Operative, who does only what he is told to do, and the inhuman Reavers, created by the Alliance's need to control people, are only two examples of this theme."}

He was a member of the Whig Party. He was one of the few prime ministers who never was given a title of nobility.\nGrenville was the second son of Richard Grenville and Hester Temple. His older brother was Richard Grenville-Temple. Grenville went to school at Eton College and at Christ Church College, Oxford. He entered Parliament in 1741 as member for Buckingham, and represented Buckingham until his death.\nAs Treasurer of the Navy in 1758 he introduced and carried a bill which established a fairer system of paying the wages of sailors. He stayed in office in 1761, when Pitt resigned, and in the administration of Lord Bute acted as Leader of the House of Commons. In May 1762 he became Secretary of State for the Northern Department, and in October First Lord of the Admiralty; and in April 1763 he became First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. \nWhile Prime Minister, his government oversaw the prosecution of John Wilkes and the passing of the American Stamp Act 1765, which led to the first disagreements between American colonies and Great Britain that led to the American Revolutionary War. \nAfter many years of being Prime Minister, he began to have disagreements with young king George III. The king started to think that the Prime Minister was using him as a puppet. The king convinced Rockingham to become the new Prime Minister and Grenville never held an office again.\nGrenville was called the \"gentile shepherd\" because he bored the House by asking over and over again, during the debate on the Cider Bill of 1763, that somebody should tell him \"where\" to lay the new tax if it was not to be put on cider. Pitt whistled the air of the popular tune \"Gentle Shepherd, tell me where\", and the House laughed. Though few excelled him in a knowledge of the forms of the House or in mastery of administrative details, he lacked tact in dealing with people and with affairs.\nIn 1749 Grenville married Elizabeth Wyndham (before 1731-5 December 1769), daughter of Sir William Wyndham. They had seven children."}

He was also called Hardrada (, modern Norwegian: (\"stern counsel\" or \"hard ruler\") in the sagas). \nHarald was King of Norway (as Harald III) from 1046 to 1066. Also, he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066. Before becoming king, Harald had spent about fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire.\nWhen he was fifteen years old, in 1030, Harald fought with his half-brother Olaf against Cnut (Canute). Olaf sought to reclaim the Norwegian throne, which he had lost to the Danish king Cnut the Great two years before. In the battle, Olaf and Harald were defeated by forces loyal to Cnut. Harald was forced into exile to Kievan Rus' (early form of Russia). After some time in the army of Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, he moved on to Constantinople with his companions around 1034. In Constantinople, he commanded the Byzantine Varangian Guard. \nHarald got wealthy during his time in the Byzantine Empire. He shipped the money to Yaroslav in Kievan Rus' for safekeeping. He finally left the Byzantines in 1042. He arrived back in Kievan Rus' to prepare his campaign of reclaiming the Norwegian throne. In his absence Olaf's illegitimate son Magnus the Good had got the throne. Magnus had also become king of Denmark.\nIn 1046, Harald joined forces with Magnus's rival in Denmark the pretender Sweyn II of Denmark, and started raiding the Danish coast. Magnus, unwilling to fight his uncle, agreed to share the kingship with Harald, since Harald in turn would share his wealth with him. The co-rule ended abruptly the next year as Magnus died, so Harald became the sole ruler of Norway. \nDomestically, Harald crushed all opposition, and outlined the union of Norway under a national rule. Harald's reign was probably one of relative peace and stability, and he set up a viable coin economy and foreign trade. Probably seeking to restore Cnut's \"North Sea Empire\", Harald also claimed the Danish throne, and spent nearly every year until 1064 raiding the Danish coast and fighting his former ally, Sweyn. Although the campaigns were successful, he was never able to conquer Denmark.\nNot long after Harald had renounced his claim to Denmark, the former Earl of Northumbria, Tostig Godwinson, brother of the English king Harold Godwinson, pledged his allegiance to Harald and invited him to claim the English throne. Harald invaded Northern England with 10,000 troops and 300 longships in September 1066, raided the coast and defeated English regional forces of Northumbria and Mercia in the Battle of Fulford near York. Although initially successful, Harald was defeated and killed in an attack by Harold Godwinson's forces in the Battle of Stamford Bridge, which wiped out almost his entire army. Modern historians have often considered Harald's death, which brought an end to his invasion, as the end of the Viking Age. The famous Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records these events."}

It was quickly accepted because it was better than ropes made of hemp or to metal chains, such as had been used before.\nWilhelm Albert's first ropes consisted of wires twisted about a hemp rope core, six such strands then being twisted around another hemp rope core in alternating directions for extra stability. Earlier forms of wire rope had been made by covering a bundle of wires with hemp.\nIn America wire rope was later manufactured by John A. Roebling, forming the basis for his success in suspension bridge building. Roebling introduced a number of innovations in the design, materials and manufacture of wire rope.\nManufacturing a wire rope is similar to making one from natural fibres. The individual wires are first twisted into a strand, then six or so such strands again twisted around a core. This core may consist of steel, but also of natural fibres such as sisal, manila, henequen, jute, or hemp. This is used to cushion off stress forces when bending the rope.\nConstruction &amp; specification.\nThe specification of a wire rope type, including the number of wires per strand, the number of strands, and the lay of the rope, are is documented using a commonly accepted coding system, with abbreviations. For example, the rope shown in the figure \"Wire rope construction\" is designated:\n6x19 FC RH OL FSWR\nEach of the sections of the wire rope designation described above is variable. There are therefore a large number of combinations of wire rope that can be specified in this manner. The following abbreviations are commonly used to specify a wire rope."}

A set with one thing in it is countable, and so is a set with one hundred things in it. A set with all the natural numbers (counting numbers) in it is countable too. This is because even if it is infinite, someone who counts forever would not miss any of the numbers. The sets which has the same size as the natural numbers are therefore called countably infinite. The size of these sets are then written as formula_1(aleph-null)\u2014the first of the aleph numbers. Sometimes when people say 'countable set' they mean countable and infinite. Georg Cantor coined the term.\nExamples of countable sets.\nCountable sets include all sets with a finite number of members, no matter how many.\nCountable sets also include some infinite sets, such as the natural numbers. Since it is impossible to actually count infinite sets, we consider them countable if we can find a way to list them all without missing any. The natural numbers have been nicknamed \"the counting numbers\", since they are what we usually use to count things with.\nYou can count the natural numbers with formula_2\nYou can count the whole numbers with formula_3\nYou can count the integers with formula_4\nYou can count the square integer numbers with formula_5\nA more-complex example.\nThe rational numbers are also countable, but its counting becomes tricky. We can't just list the fractions as (0/1, 1/1, -1/1, 2/1, -2/1...) since we will never get to 1/2 this way. However, we can list all of the rational numbers in the form of a table. The horizontal rows are the numerators, while the vertical columns are the denominators. We can then zigzag through the list, starting at 1/1, then 2/1, then 1/2, then 1/3, then 2/2, then 3/1, then 4/1, then 3/2, then 2/3, etc. If we keep this up, we will get to all of the numbers on the table in due time. Each time we hit a new rational number that is new, we add it to the list of counted numbers. We don't want to count numbers twice, so when we hit 3/6, for example, we can skip it, because we already counted the rational number 1/2. In this way, we produce an infinite list with all the rational numbers. Therefore, the rational numbers are countable.\nNot all counting schemes will yield a countable list.\nSuppose the integers are counted differently, as\nThis does not prove that the integers are uncountable, but it does illustrate what one might call a \"failed\" effort to count a set, because it is never possible to reach formula_7.

Still others say that the colour name means the colour of the belly of a flea. \nOn the other hand, the colour name may refer to blue-lavender of the Pennyroyal flower, also named \"puce\" in French. The name may come from the use of strong-smelling Pennyroyal to ward off fleas.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED) dates the use of \"puce\" (in \"couleur puce\")in English from 1787. The first recorded use of \"puce\" as a color name was in the 14th century, in the French language."}

{"id": "51911", "revid": "766335", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51911", "title": "Claudius", "text": "Claudius ; 1 August 10 BC \u2013 13 October 54 AD) was the fourth Roman emperor. He ruled from 24 January 41 to his death in 54 . His great-uncle was the first emperor, Augustus, and his uncle was the second emperor Tiberius. His nephew was the third emperor, Caligula. His maternal grandfather was Mark Antony.\nClaudius had some kind of disability, in speech and walking, and his family kept him from public office until he was 38. Claudius' infirmity may have saved him from the purges of Tiberius' and Caligula's reigns; enemies did not see him as a serious threat. He was declared emperor at the insistence of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination. He was then the last adult male of his family.\nDespite his lack of experience, Claudius proved a good administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the Empire, and the conquest of Roman Britain. He took a personal interest in the law, and he presided at public trials. Claudius suffered setbacks in his personal life, one of which may have led to his murder. He married four times, and the marriages did not turn out well. Claudius' relative and adopted son Nero succeeded him as emperor, and undid much of his good work.\nAssassination of Caligula.\nOn 24 January 41 , Caligula was assassinated by a broad-based conspiracy. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the assassination, although it has been argued that he knew about the plot. In the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the German guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including some of his friends. He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named Gratus found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him emperor. A section of the guard may have planned to seek out Claudius, perhaps with his approval. They reassured him that they were not one of the groups looking for revenge. He was put under their protection.\nThe Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government. When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval. He refused, sensing danger. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.\nExpansion of the empire.\nUnder Claudius, the empire expanded for the first time since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of Thrace, Judea and three other provinces were annexed during his term. The annexation of Mauretania, begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, and divided into two provinces. The most important new expansion was the conquest of Great Britain (). In 43 , Claudius sent four legions to Britain. The island was an attractive target for Rome because of its wealth \u2013 particularly mines and slaves. It was also a haven for Gallic rebels and the like, and so could not be left alone much longer. Claudius himself traveled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements and elephants.\nThe Senate granted him a Roman triumph for his efforts: in the Roman Empire only members of the imperial family were allowed such honors. Claudius later lifted this restriction for some of his generals. When the British general Caractacus was captured in 50, Claudius granted him his life. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.\nClaudius conducted a census in 48 that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens, an increase of about a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death.\nMarriages and personal life.\nClaudius married four times. His first marriage, to Plautia Urgulanilla, occurred after two failed betrothals. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Unfortunately, Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, the daughter of Sejanus. Claudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius repudiated the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was one of his own freedmen.\nSoon after (possibly in 28 ), Claudius married Aelia Paetina, a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, Claudia Antonia.\nSome years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39 , Claudius married Valeria Messalina, who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter Claudia Octavia. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as Britannicus, was born just after Claudius' accession. This marriage ended in tragedy. Messalina was regularly unfaithful to Claudius and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth. In 48 Messalina married her lover Gaius Silius in a public ceremony while Claudius was at Ostia. The result was the execution of Silius, Messalina, and most of her circle. Claudius made the Praetorians promise to kill him if he ever married again.\nAgrippina the Younger.\nDespite this declaration, Claudius did marry once more, his niece Agrippina the Younger.\nThe attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position since he did not have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy. Agrippina's son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the emperor Nero) was one of the last males of the imperial family. Future coup attempts could rally around the pair, and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina, and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son.\nNero was made joint heir with the underage Britannicus, married to Octavia and heavily promoted. Nero was popular with the public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.\nDeath, deification, and reputation.\nThe consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison, and died in the early hours of 13 October, 54 . Accounts vary greatly, but nearly all implicate his last wife, Agrippina, as the instigator. Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.\nClaudius was described as physically repulsive, weak, and easily manipulated by his wives and companions by Suetonius, but this historian cannot be entirely trusted. The surviving works of Claudius present a different view. They paint a picture of an intelligent, scholarly, well-read, and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice. Thus, Claudius becomes an enigma. Since the discovery of his letter to the Alexandrians in the last century, much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies.\nScholarly works and their impact.\nClaudius wrote copiously throughout his life. Besides the history of Augustus' reign, his major works included an Etruscan history and eight volumes on Carthaginian history, as well as an Etruscan dictionary and a book on dice playing. Claudius is the last person known to have been able to read Etruscan. His first wife was Etruscan. Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography.\nUnfortunately, none of these major works survive. They do live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius' autobiography once, and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of Pliny's \"Natural History\". Pliny credits him by name in Book VII 35.p83\nMany of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by Julius Caesar. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.\nIn literature and film.\nThe best known fictional representation of the emperor Claudius were the books \"I, Claudius\" and \"Claudius the God\" (published in 1934 and 1935) by the poet Robert Graves. They were both written in the first-person, as if they are Claudius' autobiography. Graves' plot suggested there were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius' writings. Claudius' genuine surviving letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, \"Claudius the God\") in order to add authenticity.\nGraves's two books were the basis for an \"I, Claudius\" TV series by the BBC. The series starred Derek Jacobi as Claudius and was broadcast in 1976 on BBC2. It was a substantial critical success, and won several BAFTA awards. The series was later broadcast in the United States on \"Masterpiece Theatre\" in 1977. The DVD release of the television series contains \"The Epic that Never Was\" documentary.\nClaudius has been portrayed in movies on several occasions. \"I, Claudius\" (1937, Director Josef von Stromberg), unfinished; Charles Laughton as Claudius was a great performance. The surviving reels were featured in the BBC television documentary \"The Epic that never was\" (1965), revealing some of Laughton's most accomplished acting. Also, minor portrayals in \"Demetrius and the Gladiators\" (1954) and \"Caligula\" (1979)."}

Claudius was probably assassinated by Nero's mother Agrippina the Younger. Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus (Claudius' natural son) could gain power.\nNero as Emperor.\nDuring his reign, Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade, and improving the cultural capital of the empire.

{"id": "51913", "revid": "103847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51913", "title": "Trades union", "text": "A trades union (U.S: \"trade union\") is an organization or group of workers who join together to negotiate pay, hours, benefits, and working conditions. Union members and supporters of unions claim that they are necessary because the people that run companies want to pay as little as possible. In the United States, they are often called labor unions.\nThe term as used in Great Britain is trades union (plural: \"trades unions\") because they were a joining of men \"working in different trades\". For example: on the engine of a steam locomotive were two men: a driver and a stoker shovelling the coal into the oven. The driver was a skilled man, and paid much more than the stoker. They were two different trades. When they joined into the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF), their negotiations with management was done together. A quite different union, the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) looked after other employees of the railway compaies. That was a whole collection of different trades.\nActivities.\nUnions do many things for their members. This includes:\nArticle 8 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ensure the right to form and join trade union and use strikes.\nStrikes.\nIf collective bargaining does not work, unions often use strikes to get their demands. However, the threat of a strike is usually enough: over 98% of union contracts are renewed without a strike.\nHistory.\nTrades unions are the descendants of the trade guilds of mediaeval times. These guilds were made up of independent skilled workers (or artisans) who had been apprenticed and qualified by a guild.\nBritish trades union 1750\u20131850.\nA trades union is a collection of people from different trades who want to keep and improve their jobs and their working and living conditions. Member of a trades union will usually working in the same industry.\nTrade unionism eventually became accepted as a fact of life by British governments and employers \u2013 but with much struggle. The acceptance of trades unions was no coincidence; it took place when British industry was at its most confident, steady economic growth had dampened revolutionary enthusiasm. At the same time providing the means whereby employers could buy off discontent with higher wages and improved conditions of work.\nThis did not mean that unions were will liked by the Establishment. In fact, trades unions had to take care to create a good image in mid-Victorian terms in order to win tolerance and acceptance. However, in the early part of the nineteenth century the future of Trade Unionism was not certain.\nThe development of trades unionism.\nTrades unions developed slowly in Britain but they can be traced right back to the Middle Ages. In medieval towns and villages, trade guilds started to develop. With both the master and the employees assigned to the guild of their particular craft.\nIn 1563 The Statute of Artificers was passed by Elizabeth 1\u2019s government. The Statute had some negative effects such as not allowing apprentices to look for work outside of their parish but it had positive effects as well such as requiring justices of the peace to maintain living standards and to monitor apprentices in their district. This meant that craftsmen received some protection from the state.\nBy the 19th century attitudes had changed. People now hated government interference in their businesses. As the population increased so did the size of businesses and it was no longer possible for employers to have a personal relationship with each employee. Due to this in 1813 the Statute was repealed. Now workers began to form trade clubs and associations to protect industrial and personal interests.\nEarly trades unions were only for skilled \u201cartisan\u201d trades. These craft trade unions or \u201csocieties\u201d were mainly formed amongst cobblers, printers and mechanics.\nCraft trade unions were distinctive because they had:\nCraft societies had only a few members and were restricted to a certain trade in a certain town. Members were usually literate and rationalist. The actual society was usually based on a public house, with meetings etc. convened there.\nFriendly societies.\nThese were different from trades unions but had some functions in common. Friendly societies were \u201cself help\u201d organisations. In exchange for a subscription fee, they would provide financial support to workers in the event of, for example, death or illness.\nThey were usually locally based; Tyneside in the 1820s had 165 societies with a total of 10,000 members.\nGradually the societies or groups of workers were formed into larger bodies called \u201ccombinations\u201d. Instead of just paying out benefits, they became more militant and begun to lobby for better conditions and better pay etc.\nWorkers were also able to petition parliament when they had a particular grievance over working conditions or wages for instance.\nOver the 18th century, these trade clubs became more aggressive and powerful. Small groups joined together into \u201ccombinations\u201d and campaigned to improve working conditions and demanded higher wages. Some combinations organised local strikes.\nCombination acts.\nThe government realised that something had to be done about combinations. The Aristocracy were worried about the number and power of combinations. The French Revolution only scared them more. As a result of the above-mentioned situation, the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 were introduced. The acts forbade Labour Unions from combining to campaign for better working conditions and for an increase in wages. If workers broke this new law they could be sent to prison for up to 3 months. This act was strictly enforced.\nThe combination acts had little success, trades union simply carried on in secret. E.P. Thomson claimed that the number of trade unions had even increased. Some unions called themselves \u201cfriendly societies\u201d and thus continued to work. In 1823 a London tailor called Francis Place led the movement for repeal. With the support of MP Joseph Hume the government was convinced to set up a parliamentary committee to look into the issue of repeal. The government no longer feared revolution, combinations and peaceful bargaining now seemed acceptable. The committee recommended the repeal of the Combination Acts and parliament acted accordingly. The combination acts were repealed in 1824. Trades unions were now legal.\nStrikes quickly occurred across the country. The government then decided to bring in the Amending Combination Act in 1825 which allowed the existence of trades union but refused them the right to stage protests.\nThe problems of early trades unionism.\nTrades unionism faced quite a few problems in their creation and organisation:\n1. Preventative legislation (laws etc.) most notably the Combination Acts 1799\u20131800\n2. The prevalence of the domestic system of working.\n3. an identity of interest between employer and the domestic employee (domestic employees only had contact with their employer and not with their fellow employees \u2013 employers adopted a \u201cpaternalistic\u201d approach to their workers)\n4. Factory works was undeveloped in the early 19th century. As soon as factories had taken off the \u2018working classes emerged. The traditional bond of trust between employer and employees were later eroded and working people began to club together.\n5. Government fears. The government believed that all working people could club together and react en masse to social change scared the government. The ruling classes associated \u2018combinations\u2019 with revolution. The many Combination acts of 1700\u20131800 aimed to prevent trade unions from being formed.\nEarly national trades unions.\nIn the 1820s the idea of creating a national union was spreading.\nA cotton spinner from Manchester named John Doherty summoned a conference on the Isle of Man in 1829 to discuss the idea of a national trade union. He then formed the Grand General Union of Operative Spinners of Great Britain and Ireland. The following July he formed National Association for the Protection of Labour which was to be made of most trades. In 1831 the association had disintegrated; mainly due to poor communication links which made it impossible to organise events.\nRobert Owen and the GNCTU.\nIn February 1834, the Grand National Consolidated Trade Union was formed, largely as a result of Robert Owen. Owen dreamed of a socialist society, he hoped that a national union would help this happen.\nRobert Owen was an important figure in the formation of the GNCTU. Owen and Doherty were associates and the GNCTU was based on Doherty\u2019s Grand General Union. The union was heavily influenced by Owenite socialism.\nWhy was the GNCTU Formed?\nThe objectives of the GNCTU were straightforward and traditionalist, thus strike action was to be used:\nThe failure of the GNCTU.\nIt is disputed whether of not his union succeeded. It lasted just six months (February to August 1834). Owen claimed that there was around half a million members, but other estimates put the figure at around 16,000 members.\nThe union failed for a number of reasons. Owen did not really understand or empathise the suffering of the workers, who had genuine and immense concerns. The general body or workers favoured militant action but Owen preferred a steady, more legalistic approach. The size of the GNTCU also made any strikes difficult to organise. A further problem was the fact that many employers forbade their employees from joining the GNTCU, and refused to let them work if they had not signed a document which renounced the organisation.\nTolpuddle martyrs.\nIn February 1834 six workers for Tolpuddle in Dorset formed a union. 13 shillings was what the average family need to survive but the men were being paid just 9 shillings. Led by George Loveless the farm labourers fought for increased wages. James Frampton, the landowner, was determined to stop industrial action; he reported the group to the Home Secretary Lord Melbourne. The men were arrested, tried and sentenced to seven years transportation. The judge said that he made he did this to make an example of them for the sake of the stability of the nation. The men became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs, and the judge's wishes were carried out. Support for the GNCTU fell dramatically and by August 1834 it had collapsed.\nTrades unions between 1835 and 1850.\nThe orthodox view is that trade unionism virtually stopped for the next 15 years after the collapse of the GNCTU, with many workers becoming involved in the alternative reforms adopted by Chartism. However, in the skilled trades unions were flourishing, with trade unions having an estimated 100,000 memberships in the early 1840s.\nCriticism.\nUnions have been criticized for increasing the cost of workers. Because of this, it is said that fewer people will be hired. A union might also protect workers an employer feels are not productive enough. For example, many unions protect workers who have worked for a job for a long time from being punished or fired, even if new workers are faster.\nSome unions are also tied to organized crime, political corruption, or even tied to the employers of the workers they represent."}

It was used on the battlefield before katana was, so it is considered to be older. The word Tachi translates as \"the soul of bushi\" (soul of samurai). \nWhen the katana began to be widely used the tachi sword became a court sword for ceremonies. It looks very richly decorated with traditional cord wrappings and a specially designed handle. The length of a tachi blade was around 30.70 inches (about 75cm) Because of its length the tachi was a cavalry sword and was mainly worn by horsemen. The strongly curved blade also made it easy to make slicing blows. Even if the tachi is a very long sword it is light enough to be handled with one hand. The tachi had a long enough hilt to hold it with two hands. It was especially useful for warriors who were not riding.\nThe tachi was worn hung to the belt with the cutting-edge down, unlike the katana which was worn with the cutting-edge pointing upwards. Not all tachi were the standard size. Small ones were called ko-dachi. If the sword was longer than the standard one it was called o-dachi.\nThe tachi that can be seen in museums have one or more chips along the back of the sword, while the cutting edge looks almost untouched and mirror polished. The experts explain that Samurai made the smallest possible moves with their tachi to kill the enemy. Thus when both swords were about to collide, the samurai both turned their swords and let only the blunt back (mune) of the blades hit one another. The cutting edge was used for finish touches, namely for cutting the human body."}

The Lower Jurassic started after the end-Triassic extinction event at 201.3 million years ago (mya). Its rocks form in Europe the \"Lias\" group of marine strata consisting mostly of limestone, with some clays and siltstone. It was in this formation on the Dorset Jurassic Coast that Mary Anning did much of her work. The mudstones of the earliest Jurassic (Blue Lias) give way to carbonate rocks as the water deepens in the Middle Jurassic.\nThe Jurassic period was one of the time periods when dinosaurs were on the Earth. By this time, many groups of the Triassic period had become extinct.\nBritain.\nAt the start of the Jurassic, Britain was warm temperate to subtropical, between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 north of the equator. Temperature would have been in the range of 12\u201329\u00b0C. \nShallow seas were over southern England; higher ground like the Mendip Hills were a string of islands stretching westwards South Wales. \nNorth America.\nThe Lower Jurassic in western North America is quite different. It is continental in origin, sandstones laid down in shifting streams and rivers. These sandstones were laid down over a long period from the later Permian to the Lower Jurassic."}

Personal digital assistants were designed to replace non-electronic day planners. Many PDAs can work as an address book, a calculator, a clock, and a calendar. Some also have games on them. Newer PDAs are now called smartphones and have Wi-Fi, touch screens, can read e-mail, record video, play music and make phone calls.\nProcessor.\nPDA's processor is a chip which makes the device work. PDAs can have different processors depending on their speed. If access to the Internet, GPS, or video recording are needed, the PDA needs to have a fast processor.\nMemory.\nPDA stores data and applications on RAM memory(Random Access Memory). It is a memory card inside the device. PDAs can also use SD (Secure Digital), SDIO and MMS cards. These are easy to remove and are called flash memory cards. USB flash drives can be used to add more memory.\nScreen.\nMost PDAs have touch screens. This means that the device has less buttons or has no buttons at all. Usually PDAs come with removable 'pen' (stylus) with which the screen is touched. The pen acts like a mouse for desktop PCs or like a touch pad for laptops. For other PDAs a finger is used instead of the pen.\nBattery.\nPDAs are powered by batteries. There are two types of batteries: removable and fixed. Older PDAs used alkaline batteries which the user would have to take out and replace when they ran out. Most new PDAs have Li-ion batteries. These batteries are rechargeable. PDAs use more battery power when playing video, accessing Internet or transferring data using Bluetooth. Large and bright screens also take more power. This makes the battery run out faster.\nConnection.\nA PDA can communicate with other devices, PDAs, PCs, etc. This is made with the help of infrared (IrDA) port or with Bluetooth. With this ability the devices can transfer data, download music, images, video, games, etc.\nSynchronization means having the same data on both the PDA and PC or other device. When changes are made on either the PDA or the PC, when they are synchronized, these changes made to data on one of them are also made the data on the other. The synchronization also prevents the loss of the stored information.\nAdaptation (Customization).\nCustomization is adding more memory, miniature keyboards, etc. to the PDA. Customization also can be putting other software (download Internet programs) on the PDA device."}

In simple words, it is the way of organizing information in a computer so that it can be more easily understood and worked with. Data structures are different from abstract data types in the way they are used. Data structures are the implementations of abstract data types in a concrete and physical setting. They do this by using algorithms. This can be seen in the relationship between the list (abstract data type) and the linked list (data structure). A list contains a sequence of values or bits of information. A linked list also has a \u201cpointer\u201d or \u201creference\u201d between each node of information that points to the next item and the previous one. This allows one to go forwards or backwards in the list. Furthermore, data structures are often optimized for certain operations. Finding the best data structure when solving a problem is an important part of programming. Data structure is a systematic way to store data\nBasic data structures.\nArray.\nThe simplest type of data structure is a linear array. Also known as a one-dimensional array. An array holds several values of the same type (Integer, Floats, String, etc.). Accessing elements within the array is very fast. An array is normally of fixed size. After the size of the array is defined at the start, it may not be possible to increase the size of the array without creating a new larger array and copying all values into the new array. In\u00a0computer science, an\u00a0array data structure\u00a0or simply an\u00a0array\u00a0is a\u00a0data structure\u00a0consisting of a collection of\u00a0\"elements\"\u00a0(values\u00a0or\u00a0variables), each identified by at least one\u00a0\"array index\"\u00a0or\u00a0\"key\". An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index\u00a0tuple by a mathematical formula.\nFor example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10\u00a0words\u00a0at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, 2036, so that the element with index\u00a0\"i\"\u00a0has the address 2000 + 4 \u00d7\u00a0\"i.\"\nAs the mathematical concept of a\u00a0matrix\u00a0can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term \"vector\" is used in computing to refer to an array, although\u00a0tuples\u00a0rather than\u00a0vectors\u00a0are the more correct mathematical equivalent. Arrays are often used to implement\u00a0tables, especially\u00a0look up tables; the word\u00a0\"table\"\u00a0is sometimes used as a synonym of\u00a0\"array\".\nArrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They can also be used to implement many other data structures, such as\u00a0lists\u00a0and\u00a0strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many\u00a0external storage\u00a0devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.\u00a0Processors, especially\u00a0vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.\nArrays are useful because the element indices can be computed at\u00a0run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative\u00a0statement\u00a0to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,\u00a0but not always, fixed while the array is in use.\nThe term\u00a0\"array\"\u00a0is often used to mean\u00a0array data type, a kind of\u00a0data type\u00a0provided by most\u00a0high-level programming languages\u00a0that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by\u00a0hash tables,\u00a0linked lists,\u00a0search trees, or other data structures.\nLinked list.\nA\u00a0linked data structure\u00a0is a set of\u00a0information/data\u00a0linked together by\u00a0references. The data are often called \"nodes\". The references are often called \"links\" or \"pointers\". From here on, the words \"node\" and \"pointer\" will be used for these concepts.\nIn linked data structures, pointers are only\u00a0dereferenced\u00a0or compared for equality. Thus, linked data structures are different than\u00a0arrays, which require adding and subtracting pointers.\nLinked lists,\u00a0search trees,\u00a0and expression trees are all linked data structures. They are also important in algorithms such as\u00a0topological sort\u00a0and\u00a0set union-find.\nStack.\nA stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things from it. This structure is used all throughout programming.\nThe basic implementation of a stack is also called a \u201cLast In First Out\u201d structure; however there are different variations of stack implementations.\nThere are basically three operations that can be performed on stacks. They are:\nQueue.\nA queue is an abstract data type or a linear data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end (the \u201ctail\u201d), and the deletion of existing element takes place from the other end (the \u201chead\u201d). A queue is a \u201cFirst In First Out\u201d structure. \"First In First Out\" means that elements put in the queue first will come out first, and elements put in the queue last will come out last. An example of a queue are lines of people waiting. The first person in the line goes first, and the last person in the line goes last.\nThe process of adding an element to a queue is called \u201cenqueuing\u201d and the process of removing an element from a queue is called \u201cdequeuing\u201d.\nGraph.\nA\u00a0graph\u00a0is an\u00a0abstract data type\u00a0that is meant to implement the\u00a0graph\u00a0and\u00a0hypergraph\u00a0concepts from mathematics.\nA graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable)\u00a0set\u00a0of ordered pairs, called\u00a0edges\u00a0or\u00a0arcs, of certain entities called nodes\u00a0or\u00a0vertices. As in mathematics, an edge (\"x\",\"y\") is said to\u00a0point\u00a0or\u00a0go\u00a0from\u00a0\"x\"\u00a0to\u00a0\"y\". The nodes may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or\u00a0references. A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some\u00a0edge value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute.\nTree.\nThe tree is one of the most powerful advanced data structures. It often appears in advanced subjects such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and design. Surprisingly, the tree is important in a much more basic application - the keeping of an efficient index.\nWhen a tree is used there is a high chance that an index is used. The simplest type of index is a sorted list of key fields. A tree normally has a defined structure. In the case of a binary tree, you can use a binary search to locate any item without having to look at every item.\nThe tree data type is a type of graph meaning that many algorithms made to traverse a graph also work with a tree however, the algorithms can be much similar and must have a dedicated start node, that is the node with no other nodes linking to it.\nThe problem with a simple ordered list occurs when you start adding new items and have to keep the list sorted - it can be done reasonably efficiently but requires some modifications. Additionally, a linear index is not easy to share because the whole index needs to be \u201clocked\u201d when one user edits it, whereas one \u201cbranch\u201d of a tree can be locked, leaving the other branches editable by other users (as they cannot be affected).\nHash Table.\nA hash table is an array where each index points to a linked list based on a hash value. A hash value is a value determined by a hash function. A hash function determines a unique value based on the data it is storing. This allows for access of data in constant time because the computer always knows where to look."}

{"id": "51985", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51985", "title": "Hepatitis C", "text": "Hepatitis C is an infection that mostly affects the liver. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes this disease. Often, a person with Hepatitis C does not have any symptoms (health problems or signs that he has the disease). However, chronic infection can scar the liver. Many years of infection may cause cirrhosis. Sometimes, people with cirrhosis also have liver failure or liver cancer. They can also have very swollen veins of the esophagus and stomach. The blood loss from this problem can kill.\nHepatitis C is usually spread by blood-to-blood contact (when blood from a person with Hepatitis C contacts (touches or gets into) another person's bloodstream). The most common ways that this happens are through intravenous drug use (when a person shoots drugs into one of their veins, with a needle that was already used by a person infected with Hepatitis C); nonsterile medical equipment (medical tools that were not cleaned well enough after being used on an infected person); and blood transfusions (when a person is given blood that came from an infected person).\nAround the world, about 130\u2013170 million people have Hepatitis C. Scientists began studying the Hepatitis C virus in the 1970s, and in 1989 they proved that the virus exists. As far as scientists know, this virus does not cause disease in any animals other than humans.\nThe medications that are normally used to treat Hepatitis C are called peginterferon and ribavirin. Between 50 and 80% of people who are treated (or 5 to 8 out of every 10) are cured. However, if a person's Hepatitis C has progressed (or gotten worse) so much that the person has cirrhosis or liver cancer, the person might need a liver transplant (they might need to have surgery where they are given another person's liver, or part of another person's liver). This makes it possible for the person to survive, but the Hepatitis C virus usually comes back after the transplant. There is no vaccine that works to prevent people from getting Hepatitis C.\nSigns and symptoms.\nHepatitis C causes acute symptoms (symptoms that begin quickly or last only a short time) in just 15% of people with the disease. More often, infected people have symptoms that are mild (not serious) and vague (not very specific), like a decreased appetite (not feeling like eating), fatigue (feeling tired), nausea (feeling like throwing up), pain in the muscles or joints, and losing weight. Every once in a while, an infected person may get jaundice (where a person's skin turns yellow, a sign that their liver is not working quite right). If it is not treated, Hepatitis C goes away by itself in 10-50% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 10). This happens more often in young women than in other infected people.\nChronic infection.\nEighty percent (or 8 out of every 10) of people exposed to the Hepatitis C virus get a chronic infection (one that does not get better and lasts for a long time). Most experience very few or no symptoms during the first decades of the infection, although chronic Hepatitis C can cause fatigue (feeling tired). But in people who have been infected for many years, Hepatitis C can cause serious problems, like cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C leads to cirrhosis in 10\u201330% (between 10 and 30 out of every 100) of people who have been infected over 30 years. People with Hepatitis C are more likely to get cirrhosis if they are men; if they are alcoholics; or if they also have Hepatitis B or HIV. Cirrhosis can cause serious problems on its own, but it also makes people more likely to get other serious illnesses. For example, people who get cirrhosis are twenty times more likely to get liver cancer (with about 1-3% getting liver cancer every year). People with Hepatitis C who are alcoholics are even more likely - 100 times more likely - to get liver cancer. Among people in general, 27% of all cases of cirrhosis, and 25% of all cases of liver cancer, are caused by Hepatitis C.\nCirrhosis of the liver can cause many different symptoms. Some of these symptoms are high blood pressure in the veins that travel to the liver; a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, called ascites; easy bruising or bleeding; veins becoming larger than normal, especially in the stomach and esophagus; jaundice (a yellowing of the skin); and brain damage.\nEffects outside the liver.\nHepatitis C can also cause some rare problems (problems which do not happen very often), which affect parts of the body outside of the liver. One rare problem that Hepatitis C can cause is Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder (or a disorder where the body's system of defenses attacks itself). Hepatitis C can also cause a lower-than-normal number of blood platelets (the part of the blood which causes blood to clot; without enough platelets, a person can have bleeding problems, or can start bleeding and be unable to stop. Other rare problems that Hepatitis C can cause are chronic (long-lasting) skin disease; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (a type of cancer); and diabetes (where a person's body does not make or use enough insulin, an important hormone that controls the level of sugar in the blood).\nCause.\nHepatitis C is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the scientific system that names and organizes viruses, the Hepatitis C virus is part of the \"hepacivirus\" genus in the family \"Flaviviridae\". There are seven major types of HCV, called \"genotypes\". In the United States, the first genotype of HCV causes 70% of all cases of Hepatitis C (or 7 out of every 10); the second genotype causes 20% (or 2 out of every 10); and each of the other genotypes causes 1% (or 1 out of every 100 cases). Thr first genotype is also the most common in South America and Europe.\nTransmission.\nIn the developed world, the most common way that people get Hepatitis C is through intravenous drug use (by shooting drugs into a vein, using a needle that was already used by a person who has Hepatitis C). In the developing world, most people get Hepatitis C through blood transfusions (being given blood that was taken from a person with Hepatitis C) or by getting medical care with tools that were not cleaned enough after being used on a person with Hepatitis C. In 20% of all cases of Hepatitis C (or 1 in every 5 cases), it is not known what caused the infection, but many of these cases are thought to have been caused by intravenous drug use.\nIntravenous drug use.\nIn many parts of the world, intravenous (IV) drug use (shooting drugs into a vein using a needle) is a major risk factor for Hepatitis C (meaning that it makes people more likely to get the disease). One study that looked at 77 countries showed that in 25 of these countries (including the United States), between 60% and 80% (or 6 to 8 out of every 10) of all IV drug users had Hepatitis C. and China. In twelve of the countries in the study, more than 80% of all IV drug users had Hepatitis C. Across the world, as many as ten million IV drug users are thought to have Hepatitis C; the highest totals are in China (1.6 million), the United States (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million). Studies have also shown that in places where there are high numbers of IV drug users, people are more likely to have Hepatitis C. For example, prisoners in the United States are ten to twenty times more likely than the general population (people in general) to have Hepatitis C. This is thought to be because prisoners are more likely to things that put them at high risk for getting Hepatitis C, like using IV drugs and getting tattoos with tools that have not been cleaned properly.\nHealthcare exposure.\nPeoples are at risk for getting Hepatitis C if they get blood transfusions (where a person is given blood from another person), blood products (which have blood or parts of blood in them), or organ transplants (where a person who needs a new organ is given an organ from another person), if these things have not been screened (or tested) for the Hepatitis C virus. In the United States, there has been universal screening - meaning that all blood and organs are tested before being given to another person - since 1992. Before then, about one out of every 200 units of blood carried the Hepatitis C virus; since 1992, only one in 10,000 to 10,000,000 units of blood carry the virus. The reason that there is still a low risk, instead of no risk at all, is that a person's blood does not test positive for the Hepatitis C virus until about 11\u201370 days after they get the disease. So every once in a while, the screening tests may not pick up on a person's infection if the person got Hepatitis C less than 11\u201370 days before giving blood. While Hepatitis C screening works very well, some countries still do not screen blood and organ donations for the disease because of the cost.\nSometimes, a healthcare worker will accidentally get stuck with a needle that was used on a person with Hepatitis C. If this happens, the healthcare worker has a small chance - about a 1.8% chance - of becoming infected. The worker is more likely to get infected if the needle they were stuck with was hollow, or if the needle stuck deeply into their skin It is also possible for the Hepatitis C virus to spread if an infected person's mucus touches another person's blood; however, the risk of this happening is low. The virus cannot be spread if an infected person's mucus touches another person's intact skin (skin that is whole and not damaged, with no wounds).\nHepatitis C can also be transmitted (or spread) through hospital equipment that has not been cleaned enough after being used on an infected person. Hepatitis C can be spread through needles, syringes, and medication vials (or containers) that are re-used; through infusion bags (which are used to pump medications into a person's body; and through surgical equipment that is not sterile (or clean and free of germs). In Egypt, which has the highest rate of infection in the world, medical and dental facilities with poor standards of care and cleanliness are the most common reason that Hepatitis C spreads.\nSexual intercourse.\nScientists do not know whether Hepatitis C can be transmitted (or spread) through sex. Hepatitis C is more likely in people who have high-risk sexual activity (sexual actions which make them much more likely to get Hepatitis C). However, it is not known whether this is because of these people's sexual behavior, or because these people were also using IV drugs. There does not seem to be any risk that Hepatitis C can be spread through sexual contact between a heterosexual couple (a man and a woman; commonly called a \"straight\" couple) if neither person has sex with anyone else. There does seem to be a risk of Hepatitis C spreading if one person already has a sexually transmitted infection, like HIV or genital ulceration; or if two people have sex in a way that causes wounds to the lining of the anal canal (like anal penetration - one person putting his penis into another person's anus). The United States government says that most people need to use condoms to protect themselves from getting Hepatitis C only if they have more than one sexual partner.\nBody piercings.\nPeople who get tattoos are about two to three times more likely to get Hepatitis C. This can be because of tools that are not sterile (not clean or free of germs), or because the dyes used for tattooing are contaminated (the Hepatitis C virus has gotten inside of them).\nTattoos or body piercings that were done before the mid-1980s or by people who are not professionals (not experts) are especially likely to spread Hepatitis C, since they are more likely to have used tools that were not sterile. Bigger tattoos also seem to put a person at more risk of getting Hepatitis C. The risk of getting Hepatitis C is very high in prisons; in the United States, almost half of all prison inmates share tattooing tools that are not sterile. However, if a tattoo is done in a licensed place of business (which has to follow rules about cleaning tools and preventing diseases from spreading), there is almost no risk of getting Hepatitis C from the tattoo.\nContact with blood.\nBecause Hepatitis C is spread by blood-to-blood contact, personal-care tools which come into contact with blood - like razors, toothbrushes, and manicure or pedicure equipment or any other kind of blood to blood contact - can spread the disease if they are shared. To prevent the spread of Hepatitis C, people should be careful with cuts, sores, or anything else that causes bleeding. Hepatitis C does not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating or cooking utensils.\nTransmission from mother to child.\nAlthough this does not happen very often, a pregnant woman who has Hepatitis C can give the disease to her baby when it is born, or to her fetus while she is pregnant. This happens in less than 10% of all pregnancies (less than 1 out of every 10 pregnancies). If a pregnant woman has Hepatitis C, nothing can be done to make her less likely to give her baby the disease. If the woman is in labor (the process of delivering her baby) for a long time, there is more of a chance that the baby will become infected during the birth. Breastfeeding does not seem to spread the disease. However, doctors say that an infected mother should not breastfeed if her nipples are cracked and bleeding, or her viral loads (the amount of the Hepatitis C virus in her blood) are high.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are a few different tests that can diagnose Hepatitis C (or say for sure that a person has the disease). These tests are called HCV antibody, ELISA, Western blot, and quantitative HCV RNA tests. A technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can show that a person has Hepatitis C virus RNA (part of the virus's genetic blueprint) one to two weeks after the person becomes infected. Tests that look for Hepatitis C antibodies (which the body makes to fight the disease) cannot be done this quickly after infection, because the antibodies can take much longer to form and show up.\nA person has chronic Hepatitis C if he has been infected with the Hepatitis C virus for more than six months. Because people with chronic Hepatitis C often have no symptoms for decades, doctors often diagnose it through liver function tests (which test how well the liver is working) or by doing routine (regular) screening of high-risk people. Tests cannot tell whether an infection is acute or chronic.\nBlood testing.\nHepatitis C testing usually begins with blood tests that look for antibodies to the Hepatitis C virus, using a technique called an enzyme immunoassay. If this test is positive (showing that the body is making antibodies to fight the Hepatitis C virus), the person will be tested a second time to make sure that the results are correct and to see how serious the infection is. The results are confirmed using a technique called a recombinant immunoblot assay, and an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction shows how serious the infection is. If the immunoblot is positive, but there are no Hepatitis C virus RNA, this shows that the person had an infection, but it cleared up either with treatment or on its own. If the immunoblot is negative, this shows that the immunoassay (the first test) was wrong, and the person does not have Hepatitis C. It takes six to eight weeks after a person gets infected before the immunoassay will test positive.\nDuring the first part of a Hepatitis C infection, a person's liver enzymes may change; on average, they begin to rise seven weeks after infection. A person's liver enzymes usually do not affect how severe their infection is.\nBiopsy.\nA test called a liver biopsy can show whether a person's liver has been damaged, or how badly it has been damaged, by Hepatitis C. However, there are some risks from the procedure. In a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece out of the patient's liver so that he can test it. There are three major changes to the liver that a biopsy usually shows. One is that lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) show up in the liver tissue. Another is that lymphoid follicles (small masses or swellings) show up in the portal triad, a part of the liver. The third is changes to the bile ducts (these carry bile, which is made in the liver and is needed to help a person digest their food, to other parts of the body). Many blood tests are available which try to measure how much damage there is to a patient's liver, in order to avoid the need for a biopsy and its risks.\nScreening.\nAs few as 5\u201350% of infected people in the United States and Canada (or 5 to 50 out of every 100) know that they have Hepatitis C. Doctors suggest that people who are at high risk for the disease, including people with tattoos, should get tested. Screening is also suggested for people with elevated (high) liver enzymes, since this is often the only sign that a person has chronic hepatitis. Routine screening (testing everyone) is not recommended in the United States.\nPrevention.\nAs of 2012, there is no vaccine that works to prevent Hepatitis C. Researchers are working on vaccines, are some are making progress. The spread of Hepatitis C can be prevented by using a combination of strategies, like needle exchange programs (where IV drug users can get clean needles which will not spread the virus) and treatment for drug abuse. If these strategies are used together, the risk of IV drug users getting Hepatitis C drops by about 75%. At a national level - within each country - screening blood donors is important for preventing the spread of Hepatitis C. So is using universal precautions in healthcare facilities. (This means that healthcare workers treat every patient as if he has Hepatitis C, and they always wear gloves, clean their equipment properly, and keep things sterile so that diseases cannot be spread.) In countries that do not have enough sterile syringes to use a new needle for every patient, healthcare providers should give medications orally (by mouth) rather than via injection (using a needle) so that needles do not have to be re-used.\nTreatment.\nThe Hepatitis C virus causes chronic infection in 50\u201380% of infected persons (or 5 to 8 out of every 10). About 40-80% of these cases (or 4 to 8 out of 10) clear up with treatment. Although this almost never happens, chronic Hepatitis C can sometimes clear up on its own, without treatment. Doctors suggest that people with chronic Hepatitis C should avoid drinking alcohol and taking medications that can be toxic (or poisonous) to the liver. They also suggest that people with chronic infections should be given vaccines for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. People with cirrhosis should also have ultrasound tests for liver cancer.\nMedications.\nIf a person has liver abnormalities (changes in the liver that are not normal) due to Hepatitis C virus infection, the person should get treatment. The first treatment that is used is a drug called pegylated interferon given together with the antiviral (virus-killing) drug ribavirin. These medications are given for 24 or 48 weeks, depending on what type of Hepatitis C virus the person has. About 50\u201360% of people who are treated improve. For people with Hepatitis C virus genotype 1, treatment may work even better if another medication - either boceprevir or telaprevir - is given along with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa. Side effects with treatment are common; half of people treated get flu-like symptoms, and a third have emotional problems. Treatment works better if it is given during the first six months than after Hepatitis C becomes chronic. If a person gets a new infection and it has not cleared up after eight to twelve weeks, doctors usually suggest giving pegylated interferon for another 24 weeks. For people with thalassemia (a blood disorder), ribavirin appears to be a helpful treatment, but it makes it more likely for patients to need blood transfusions (where they need to be given blood from another person).\nSome supporters of alternative medicine say that alternative therapies like milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver can be helpful for Hepatitis C. However, there is no proof that any alternative therapy has any effect on the Hepatitis C virus.\nLikely outcome.\nPeople respond differently to treatment, depending on which of the Hepatitis C virus genotypes they have. About 40-50% in people with genotype 1 have a good, stable response with 8\u201348 weeks of treatment. In people with genotypes 2 and 3, about 70-80% have a good, stable response with 24 weeks of treatment. About 65% of people with genotype 4 have a good, stable response with 48 weeks of treatment. There is not much evidence about how well treatment works for people with genotype 6 disease is currently sparse. The evidence that does exist looks at results after 48 weeks of treatment at the same medication doses as people with genotype 1.\nEpidemiology.\nBetween 130 and 170 million people, or about 3% of all of the people in the world, are living with chronic Hepatitis C. Between 3\u20134 million people get infected per year. More than 350,000 people die every year from diseases caused by Hepatitis C. The numbers of people getting Hepatitis C have increased a lot in the 20th century for a few different reasons. More people are using IV drugs. Also, more people are getting medical care with medical equipment that is not sterile, and it is more common for medications to be given intravenously.\nIn the United States, about 2% of people have hepatitis C, with 35,000 to 185,000 new cases a year. Rates have decreased in the West since the 1990s due to improved blood screening before transfusion. Annual deaths from HCV in the United States range from 8,000 to 10,000. Expectations are that this mortality rate will increase as people infected by transfusion before HCV testing become ill and die.\nInfection rates are higher in some countries in Africa and Asia. Countries with very high rates of infection include Egypt (22%), Pakistan (4.8%) and China (3.2%). The high rate in Egypt is linked to a now-discontinued mass-treatment campaign for schistosomiasis, using improperly sterilized glass syringes.\nHistory.\nIn the mid-1970s, Harvey J. Alter, Chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, and his research team demonstrated that most post-blood transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A or B viruses. Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify the virus failed for the next decade. In 1987, Michael Houghton, Qui-Lim Choo, and George Kuo at Chiron Corporation, collaborating with Dr. D.W. Bradley from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, used a new molecular cloning approach to identify the unknown organism and develop a diagnostic test. In 1988, Alter confirmed the virus by verifying its presence in a panel of non A non B hepatitis specimens. In April 1989, the discovery of HCV was published in two articles in the journal \"Science\". The discovery led to significant improvements in diagnosis and improved antiviral treatment. In 2000, Drs. Alter and Houghton were honored with the Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research for\n\"pioneering work leading to the discovery of the virus that causes hepatitis C and the development of screening methods that reduced the risk of blood transfusion-associated hepatitis in the U.S. from 30% in 1970 to virtually zero in 2000.\"\nChiron filed for several patents on the virus and its diagnosis. A competing patent application by the CDC was dropped in 1990 after Chiron paid $1.9 million to the CDC and $337,500 to Bradley. In 1994, Bradley sued Chiron, seeking to invalidate the patent, have himself included as a coinventor, and receive damages and royalty income. He dropped the suit in 1998 after losing before an appeals court.\nSociety and culture.\nThe World Hepatitis Alliance coordinates World Hepatitis Day, held every year on July 28. The economic costs of hepatitis C are significant both to the individual and to society. In the United States the average lifetime cost of the disease was estimated at US$33,407 in 2003, with the cost of a liver transplant approximately US$200,000 as of 2011. In Canada the cost of a course of antiviral treatment was as high as 30,000 CAD in 2003, while the United States costs are between 9,200 and 17,600 in 1998 USD. In many areas of the world people are unable to afford treatment with antivirals because they lack insurance coverage or the insurance they have will not pay for antivirals.\nResearch.\nAs of 2011, about one hundred medications are in development for hepatitis C. These medicines include vaccines to treat hepatitis, immunomodulators, and cyclophilin inhibitors. These potentially new treatments have come about due to a better understanding of the hepatitis C virus."}

He wrote about many topics, and influenced many other thinkers.\nFoucault studied institutions such as psychiatric wards, hospitals, schools, and prisons, to figure out how they affected the people living in them. He was gay. He also studied the history of sexuality and, later in his life, wrote about homosexuality.\nHe is often called a postmodernist or post-structuralist philosopher. Some philosophers claim that some of his ideas were influenced by existentialism. However, Foucault rejected all of these labels.\nEarly life.\nFoucault was born in 1926 in Poitiers, France. His father, Paul Foucault, was a surgeon. He attended the Jesuit Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Stanislas. After World War II Foucault studied at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. While attending university, he became depressed, and tried to kill himself.\nFoucault became very interested in psychology. He got a degree in philosophy and a degree in psychology. Foucault joined the French Communist Party from 1950 to 1953. He left the Communist Party because he was sad about all of the people that Stalin was killing in the Soviet Union.\nUniversity professor.\nIn the early 1950s, he taught at the \u00c9cole Normale. Then he began teaching psychology at the University of Lille. In 1954 Foucault published his first book, \"Maladie mentale et personnalit\u00e9\". In the mid-1950s, he worked at Warsaw University and at the University of Hamburg.\nHe returned to France in 1960 to become a philosophy professor at the University of Clermont-Ferrand. In the mid-1960s, Foucault moved with his lover to Tunis (in North Africa), and got a job teaching at the University of Tunis. In 1966 he published \"Les Mots et les choses\" (The Order of Things), which was very popular. In 1968 he returned to France, where he published \"L'arch\u00e9ologie du savoir\" (The Archaeology of Knowledge).\nIn the late 1960s, after France had huge student protests and riots, the French government created a new experimental university at Vincennes. Foucault became the first head of its philosophy department. Foucault joined students in occupying administration buildings and fighting with police.\nIn 1970, Foucault became a Professor of the History of Systems of Thought at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. His political involvement now increased. His male lover Defert joined the ultra-Maoist Gauche Proletarienne (GP). Foucault then wrote \"Surveiller et Punir\" (Discipline and Punish), about prisons and schools.\nFinal years.\nIn the late 1970s, Foucault wrote books about the history of sexuality. Foucault began to spend more time in the United States, at the University at Buffalo. In 1978 Foucault toured Iran to support the new revolutionary Islamic government. Foucault died of an AIDS-related illness in Paris on 26 June 1984.\nTranslated writings.\nThe major collections of Foucault's writing translated into English are:"}

It was first released as a single in 1975. In 1976, it was released as part of the album \"Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols\". The song's lyrics espouse a nihilistic and violent concept of anarchy. It has been covered by various other bands, including Megadeth.\nThis song was in the video game \"\".\nMegadeth cover.\n\"Anarchy in the U.K.\" was covered by American heavy metal band Megadeth for their third album \"So Far, So Good... So What!\", released in 1994.\nMegadeth's version has altered lyrics. Dave Mustaine explained that he could not understand Johnny Rotten's singing, so he made up the parts he could not understand (in a notable example, the line \"another council tenancy\" is changed to \"and other cunt-like tendencies\"). In addition, the country is changed to \"USA\", though the title is kept unchanged. The song's music video is a montage of live footage of the band, cartoon political figures, which were designed and caricatured by Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, Paul Rudish and Rob Renzetti and animated by Fil-Cartoons, various stock footages, and of a man being forced to watch (much like Alex's therapy in \"A Clockwork Orange\"). Steve Jones played the second solo.\nMustaine now refuses to play the song live due to lyrics referring to the Anti-Christ, and he believes he's \"better for it\"."}

They released their first album in 2002. The band has released four albums to date. The band consists of Gerard Way (lead vocals), Ray Toro (lead guitar/vocals), Mikey Way (bass guitar), Frank Iero (rhythm guitar/vocals). The band announced that they were breaking up on March 22, 2013, but have announced their reunion as of October 31, 2019 guest starring Welling based guitarist Harley Roy Baker. \nHistory.\nThe band was started by Gerard Way on the day of the September 11, 2001 attacks after he was on his way to work in New York and saw the bodies falling from the building. Gerard said that he thought to himself \"What am I doing with my life? I'm slaving away doing drawings for Cartoon Network and not actually helping anybody\", he then called up his friend Matt Pelissier who went on to recruit Ray Toro - the band's lead guitarist. Gerard said \"there's nobody in New Jersey who can beat him, he is the best\". Gerard's brother Mikey Way, bass guitarist, joined his brother's new band soon after.\nProgression.\nIn May 2002, Frank Iero joined as the rhythm guitarist for the band. He was more than happy to leave college against his parents wishes to join his favourite band, and whilst MCR were on tour, he got a tattoo of a scorpion as high up on his neck as he could get it, as a stand against getting a regular job. \nIn 2004, Pelissier was kicked out of the band for stealing from the band, and was replaced by Bob Bryar - a sound technician for The Used and Thursday at the time.\nName.\nThe name of the band comes from an Irvine Welsh book titled \"Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance\" which caught Mikey Way's eye when he was working in Barnes &amp; Noble.\nMusical style and influences.\nMy Chemical Romance's sound usually has elements of punk rock, pop and alternative rock.\nThey have been categorised as alternative rock, post-hardcore, punk rock, pop punk, and, most controversially, emo.\nThe band's official website describes their music as simply \"rock\" or \"violent, dangerous pop\".\nBand frontman Gerard Way has publicly rejected the term \"emo\", describing the genre as \"fucking garbage\". However, Way has reportedly also described the band's style as \"What-else-ya-got-emo\".\nGerard said to \"Rolling Stone\", \"We love bands like Queen, where it's huge and majestic, but also bands like Black Flag and the Misfits, who would go absolutely crazy.\" Lead singer Gerard Way has stated that the band is very influenced by The Cure, Joy Division, Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Smiths/Morrissey. Way has also said that his band patterns their career after that of The Smashing Pumpkins, another band they like. The band's overall influences are:Black Flag, Iron Maiden, The Misfits, Morrissey/The Smiths, At the Gates, The Cure, The Descendents, Pantera, The Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd, Bon Jovi, The Damned, Fugazi, Ministry, New York Dolls, Nirvana, Queen, Sunny Day Real Estate, Green Day, Joy Division, Kill Creek, AFI, Cursive, and Alkaline Trio. One of Gerard Way's biggest influences was The Beach Boys.\nEspecially Pet Sounds.\nGrowing up, they were also very influenced by horror films and comic books, and therefore their music, lyrics, and image all have overt elements of fantasy, horror, and theatricality.\nAlbums.\nI Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\nThe band released their first album on July 23, 2002. It was titled \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\". The album featured the first song written by the band, Skylines And Turnstiles, which Gerard began to write after the 9/11 attacks, in 2001.\nThree Cheers for Sweet Revenge.\nThe second album by My Chemical Romance, \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\", was the album that shot them to fame with songs like \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\" and \"Helena\" (A song written about the Way brothers' grandmother, Elena. Her friends called her Helen, and Gerard thought of her as Helena). It was released in June 2004. Over two million copies of the album have been sold in the United States. The album contained a lot about death, dying and killing, but also showed the better sides of the matter.\nDuring 2004, drummer Matt Pelissier left the band.\nThe Black Parade.\nTheir third album titled \"The Black Parade\" was released on October 23rd, 2006. The album sold more than 240,000 copies in the first week after it was released. It has sold over 1 million copies in total. The first single taken from The Black Parade called \"Welcome to the Black Parade\" reached the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No.1 in the UK charts for two weeks.\nThe band has commented in the past about the album, saying that The Black Parade is like a different band performing in a different 'world', and once that's over, My Chemical Romance will never be The Black Parade again. The album largely focuses on one character, The Patient, but also consists of songs and lyrics about different subjects and aspects of life and death. At the end of the CD, there is an extra track called Blood which plays over a minute and a half later.\nDanger Days: The True Lives Of The Fabulous Killjoys.\nMCR's newest album was released on November 22, 2010. The original album was scrapped by the band due to their dislike and disappointment in it, and their second effort became what is now Danger Days. The band was halfway through making it when Bob Bryar suddenly left the band, which resulted in restarting the record. The record has spawned a tour called the World Contamination Tour, which is set to play through at least May 2011. MCR also went out on the Honda Civic tour 2011 with Blink 182. The band was using Michael Pedicone as a touring drummer to replace Bob Bryar. Pedicone was caught red handed stealing from My Chemical Romance. This resulted in him being kicked out, and replaced with Jarrod Alexander for the remainder of the Honda Civic Tour (2011). This album is musically different from Black Parade as the band has departed a bit from the dark themes of before and is infused with more pop influenced sounds and color. Set in California in the year 2019, a group of rebels called the Killjoys are rebelling against a dictator-like corporation called Better Living Industries."}

This place was famous for a kind of deep blue stone. Now we call this stone \"lapis lazuli\". This means \"stone of Lazhward\".\nThe word came to Old French by the twelfth century. The French used this word to talk about the colors of coats of arms. From the French the word came to the English. The first recorded use of \"azure\" as a color name in English was in 1374.\nHeraldry.\nIn heraldry, the word \"azure\" simply means \"blue\". Azure is said to represent Jupiter and sapphires.\nIt belongs to the class of tinctures called \"colors\". In engraving, it is sometimes depicted as a region of horizontal lines or else marked with either az. or b. as an abbreviation.\nIn addition to the standard blue tincture called azure, there is a lighter blue sometimes found that is called bleu celeste or \"sky blue\". Neither azure nor bleu celeste is precisely defined as a particular shade of blue, but azure is consistently depicted in a much darker shade."}

They got their name from the long bones in their feet. They are now placed together with the simians (monkeys). \nThey live in trees, and are entirely nocturnal. Tarsiers are the only primates which are wholly carnivorous. They mainly eat insects, but some are also known to eat birds and snakes. Tarsiers can catch prey like birds even if they are in motion as the tarsiers jump from tree to tree to catch their prey.\nSenses.\nTarsiers have incredibly good hearing. \nThey have large eyes. Each is about 16 mm wide.They are very sensitive to touch, and weigh as much as their entire brain. Unlike many nocturnal animals, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting area (tapetum lucidum) of the eye. They also have a fovea, which is also not usual in nocturnal animals. \nBrain difference.\nThe tarsier's brain is different from other primates in one respect. The sequence of cell layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus getting information from both eyes is different from the set-up in lemurs, lorises, and monkeys. \"This apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, and reinforces the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution\".\nReproduction.\nPregnancy takes about six months, which is a long time for such a small animal. Tarsiers give birth to single offspring. \nHistory.\nThey were once widespread, but now tarsiers live only on islands in south-east Asia. Fossils are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, and some disputed fossils from Africa. Living tarsiers are on several southeast Asian islands, including the Philippines, Sulawesi, Borneo, and Sumatra. \nThey also have the longest continuous fossil record of any primate. The fossil record shows that their teeth have not changed much, except in size, in the past 45 million years. That means what they eat, and probably their lifestyle, has not changed much, either.\nMass media.\nTarsiers are said to be the inspiration for the famous movie character Yoda of Star Wars due to their small size but excellent hunting skills. \nConservation status.\nOne tarsier species, Dian's tarsier (\"Tarsius dentatus\"), is listed by on the IUCN Red List as being \"lower risk \u2013 conservation dependent\". Horsfield's tarsier (\"Cephalopachus bancanus\") is listed as \"lower risk \u2013 least concern\". The spectral tarsier (\"Tarsius spectrum\") is categorized as \"lower risk, not threatened\". The pygmy tarsier (\"Tarsius pumilus\") was thought to be extinct until a family were found in 2008. The two males and single female (a fourth escaped) were captured using nets, and were radio collared to track their movements. Other tarsier species are listed as \"data deficient\"."}

Actors whose characters must appear nude or otherwise show more skin, often have flaws and imperfections such as may come with age or being overweight and it can be expensive to digitally edit these out. Often, movies or television shows that use body doubles do not admit that a body double model was used. \nIn the popular American movie \"Pretty Woman\", a fashion and parts model named Donna Scoggins posed for the infamous movie poster in thigh-high boots, while another body double, Shelley Michelle, filmed nude scenes that actress Julia Roberts did not want to do. \nRelated concepts.\nAnother job in the movie and television production industry where people do actions that the actors or actresses do not want to do is the job of stuntman. A stuntman is a person who does dangerous actions in movies, for example, jumping, falling, getting in a car accident, or pretending to fight with knives.\nWhat distinguishes a \"stunt person\" from a \"stunt double\" is the particular character they portray.

The Inca road system covered approximately 22,500 kilometres (14,000 mi) and provided access to over three million km\u00b2 of territory.\nBecause the Incas did not make use of the wheel for transportation, and did not have horses until the arrival of the Spanish in Peru in the 16th century, the trails were used almost exclusively by people walking, sometimes accompanied by pack animals, usually the llama.\nThe trails were used by the Inca people as a means of relaying messages, carried via knotted-cord quipu and by memory; and for transporting goods. Messages could be carried by runners covering as much as 240 km (150 mi) per day, working in relay fashion much like the Pony Express of the 1860s in North America.\nThere were approximately 2,000 inns, or \"tambos\", placed at even intervals along the trails. The inns provided food, shelter and military supplies to the tens of thousands who traveled the roads. \nMain routes.\nThe most important Inca road was the \"Camino Real\", as it is known in Spanish, with a length of 5,200 km (3,230 mi). It began in Quito, Ecuador, passed through Cusco, and ended in what is now Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina. The Camino Real went across the mountain ranges of the Andes, with peak altitudes of more than 5,000 m. \"El Camino de la Costa\", the coastal trail, with a length of 4,000 km (2,420 mi), ran parallel to the sea and was linked with the Camino Real by many smaller routes.\nInca trail to Machu Picchu.\nBy far the most popular of the Inca trails for trekking is the \"Capaq Nan trail\", which leads from the village of Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu, the so-called \"Lost City of the Incas\". There are many well-preserved ruins along the way, and hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world make the three- or four-day trek each year, accompanied by guides.\nThe Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is actually three routes, which all meet up near Inti-Pata, the 'Sun Gate' and entrance to Machu Picchu. The three trails are known as the \"Mollepata\", \"Classic\" and \"One Day\" trails, with \"Mollepata\" being the longest of the three. Passing through the Andes mountain range and sections of the Amazon rainforest, the Trail passes several well-preserved Inca ruins and settlements before ending at the Sun Gate on Machu Picchu mountain. The two longer routes require an ascent to beyond 12,000 ft (3,660 m) above sea level, which can result in altitude sickness. "}

What is meant by \"opposite\" can be different between color science, and art and the printing process.\nColor science.\nIn color science \"complementary colors\" are colors opposite to each other on the color wheel. Primary colors and secondary colors are typically paired in this way:\nAfterimages.\nIf a person stares at a single color for about a minute then looks at a white surface, an afterimage of the complementary color will appear. This is because of \"eye fatigue\". For example, if the person stares at a red color, the photoreceptors (cells in the eye which catch colored light) for red light in the retina (the back part of the eye) become fatigued. When photoreceptors are fatigued they are less able to send information to the brain. If the person then looks at white light, all photoreceptors will send information. Because the photoreceptors for red light are fatigued, the information they send will not be as strong as the information about the colors other than red and the illusion of seeing the complementary color is created.\nArt and design.\nBecause of the limited range of colors that was available throughout most of the history of art, many artists still use a traditional set of complementary pairs, including:\nThe complement of each primary color (red, blue, or yellow) is roughly the color made by mixing the other two in a subtractive system (red + blue = purple; blue + yellow = green; red + yellow = orange). When two complements are mixed they produce a gray or brown.\nThe use of complementary colors is an important aspect of art and graphic design. This also extends to other fields such as contrasting colors in logos and retail display. When placed next to each other, complements make each other appear brighter. On an artistic color wheel, complementary colors are placed opposite one another. Although these artistic complements may not be precise complements under the scientific definition, most artistic color wheels are laid out roughly like the HSV color wheel discussed above."}

They are still in use today, although not nearly as much as 100 years ago when there were many more horses. \nAnvils are extremely heavy. They are made in different sizes. The 17th century writer John Bunyan was a tinker (someone who mends pots and pans). He walked around the villages of Bedfordshire with a small anvil and a few tools on his back. His anvil was wedge-shaped, so that he could knock it into the ground when he needed to do a repair. His anvil is now in the John Bunyan museum in Bedford.\nUse as a musical instrument.\nThe anvil has sometimes been used as a percussion instrument because it makes a very loud sound when hit by the hammer. Usually musicians use a metal bar mounted on a sound-box. This sounds just as good as a real anvil (which would be very heavy to carry around).\nVerdi wrote some famous music called the \"Anvil Chorus\" in his opera \"Il Trovatore\". Wagner asked for 18 anvils in \"Das Rheingold\" in the scene which takes place below the earth where the Nibelungs are working at their forges. Albert Parlow wrote an \"Anvil Polka\", Var\u00e8se used an anvil in \"Ionisation\", Walton uses an anvil in \"Belshazzar\u2019s Feast\" and there is an anvil in the orchestra in Howard Shore's music for \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy."}

The word Inca can also mean the emperor or king of the Inca people. It was the largest empire in the Americas, and was large even by world standards. It existed shortly before Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas. \nThe Inca ruled along the western coast of South America for a little over 100 years, until the Spanish invasion in the 16th century. The empire was centred around the city of Cusco, or Qosqo, in what is now southern Peru. This was the administrative, political and military center of the empire. In later years, it was also centred around Quito. The Inca were ruled by an Emperor known as the \"Sapa Inca\". Throughout their empire, they built many roads and bridges to make travel between their communities easy.\nThe Inca Empire was called in Quechua, which means \"four regions\". The empire only lasted for about 100 years as the arrival of the conquering Spaniards in 1532 AD marked the end of their reign. Their main language was Quechua, but as the Empire was made up of many different groups there were probably many different languages as well.\nThe Inca Empire began around Lake Titicaca in about 1197. From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used conquest and non-violent assimilation to gain a large portion of western South America. Their empire centered on the Andean mountain ranges. It included large parts of what is now Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.\nIn 1533, Atahualpa, the last sovereign emperor, was executed by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro. That meant the beginning of Spanish rule in South America. The Inca Empire was supported by an economy based on the collective ownership of the land."}

Duct tape was also called \"100 mph tape\" by the military because it is said the tape will still stick in winds at speeds of 100 miles per hour. Duct tape got its name from its use on heating and air conditioning ducts but oddly enough, that is the one use that the tape is not very good for. It is illegal in California to use duct tape on ducts and most professional builders in the United States are not allowed to use it either.\nIn the United States, people use duct tape in many action movies and television shows.

{"id": "52286", "revid": "24306", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52286", "title": "Bastide", "text": "A bastide is a fortified town. They were built mainly in the south of France in the Middle Ages. Most bastides were built between 1229 and 1373, between the Albigensian Crusade and the Hundred Years' War. Today, there are about 400 bastides. They all have a central square, and a rectangular street layout. On the market square, the houses have arcades. They were usually built in places that were easy to defend, such as the top of a hill or on a plain.\nWell-known bastides today are Carcassonne and Andorra la Vella.\nOverview.\nBastides are medieval cities. There is an act of foundation (a law made to start them). There are often historic documents written about them.\nSome times they are planned cities and are usually only one architect (or one lord) designs it. They were often built where there was already a village, or at a place of historical importance. They were sometimes also built where people bought and sold things a lot (for example where trading routes crossed).\nThe Treaty of Paris (1229) is sometimes seen as the foundation act which made the construction of modern cities and bastides possible. The treaty itself ended the Albigensian Crusade. One of the first bastides built was Montauban. Montauban became a city in 1144. However some consider Mont-de-Marsan which was founded in 1133 to be a bastide.\nPurpose.\nMost bastides were built in the countryside. They were basically to serve the needs of local trade (usually, agriculture). A few of them were built in places which were very easy to defend. Others were built where it was possible to defend them, but most bastides were simply built where they were needed. The time when they were built was a peaceful one in the region.\nBuilders of Bastides.\nBastides were built by people who had a high social status, such as:\nStructural elements.\nCentral square.\nThe main feature of all bastides is a central, open place, or square. It was used for markets, but also used for political and social gatherings. A typical square, (which was probably a model for other bastides), can be found in Montauban.\nGenerally, there is just one square. Saint-Lys and Albias are different because they have two squares, one for the market, and one square for the church.\nThe square is also used to divide the city into quarters. Generally it lies outside the main street (the axis) which carried the traffic. There are three possible layouts:\nGenerally the flattest place in the bastide was used for the square.\nChurch.\nExcept in very rare cases, the church was not on the central square. Usually it was at an angle, and faced the square diagonally. One of the rare exceptions is Villefranche-de-Rouergue.\nHouses.\nThere were clear rules how houses could be built in the bastide. The front of the houses - the fa\u00e7ades - had to line up. Also there had to be a small space between the houses. The different housing lots were all alike, by was a common size. There were only a limited number of lots. This varied between 10, and several thousand (3,000 in Grenade-sur-Garonne)\nStreets.\nThe streets were usually \u2013 wide, so a chariot could pass through. They ran alongside the fa\u00e7ades of the houses. Alleys run between streets, these are usually only \u2013 wide. Sometimes they are only \u2013 wide. In a bastide there were usually between one and eight streets.\nCity walls.\nWhen bastides were founded most had no city walls or fortifications. This was because it was a peaceful time in history. Such things were added later. This was done either through a special tax, or through a law that required that the people of the city helped build the walls. A good example is Libourne. Ten years after the city was founded, the people asked for money to build city walls. Once they had received the money, they spent it on making their city prettier, rather than building walls.\nAt the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, many bastides that had no city walls were destroyed. Some of the others quickly built stone walls, to protect the city.\nLayout of a bastide.\nThere are different base layouts for bastides. Often for each type of layout, there was a bastide that was an example for other bastides. The most common layout started from two perpendicular streets. New streets were made parallel to the two original streets. This led to a usually rectangular grid layout.\nUnstructured bastide.\nThere seems to have been no plan when these bastides were built. This may have been for the following reasons:\nAn example of such a bastide is La Bastide-de-Bousignac.\nCircular bastide.\nThe circle layout for a bastide was very rare. The only surviving example is in Fourc\u00e8s.\nEnclosing type.\nEnclosing bastides were built around an existing small village or hamlet. There already was a church or a small group of houses. When new houses were built, they were added around the original buildings.\nOne axis design.\nThere is one main street that links the two gates. This makes the axis around which the bastide was built. These are quite common, with about 30\u201440% of all bastides using this design. Very often they are found on flat land. The square is often made by making the main street bigger. Very often there are alleys which run perpendicular to the main street. This layout is very easy to change to fit in with the local landscape.\nAn example of a one axis bastide is Gimont. Gimont is long, and only wide. Sometimes, there is another street which runs parallel to the main axis. The city square is made between the two streets.\nTwo axis design.\nThere are two main streets, axes, which are perpendicular (make a right angle). All other streets are at a right angle, or parallel to one of the two main streets. The city square is very often in the centre, or very near the centre. The whole city is either rectangular, square, hexagonal or oval shaped. This layout was the plan used at the height of the bastide movement.\nMaking a bastide.\nA few steps are necessary to make a new bastide, these are:\nOnce all this steps are done, the bastide is not yet founded. The next step is to attract people to come live in the new city. This is done by making a \"Charta of customs\". This Charta does not tell so much about customs, but rather about the privileges those that live there (the citizens) get. These privileges can be of different kinds:\nBastides wanted to attract people who should come to live there. They therefore offered equality to those who came to live there. They made it look like citizens had equal rights, and were free.\nLegal foundations for bastides.\nThe social system was very fixed and unchanging during the Middle Ages. The system of laws of the Middle Ages was built on the fact that society did not change. Everyone had their place in the system and they stayed there. The lords who built the bastide did not want to change the social system. All they wanted was small local improvements. Usually, the land where the bastide was built was not developed. The lords that owned the land were not making much money from it. They built the bastide because they hoped they would get more profits from the land.\nFor these reasons, people who already had a social status, (serfs, noblemen and priests) could not settle in the bastide. A few poor noblemen gave their land to the city and started a career as a trader, because that way they could earn more money than before.\nThe people who lived in the city looked free, but this freedom had limits:\nMen and women did not have equal rights. Women are often mentioned in the Charter, and have some rights:\nLepers were usually not welcome in the city. Certain bastides had special places which would treat them, but they were generally excluded from social life. They had to wear special badges to show they were ill, and they could not come close to normal people.\nAnother group of people that was generally not welcome were the Jews. In the beginning there was no problem, but later Jews were persecuted. Philip IV of France did not allow any Jews to live in France, in 1306. He confiscated their belongings and sold them.\nLater developments.\nA number of bastides were successful and still exist today. Many others have failed, and most of their population left them.\nThe bastides had three stages of development or change:"}

The term is used for mammals, particularly hoofed animals. Herding is a good example of collective animal behavior. Other terms are used for similar types of behavior in other types of animal. For example, a large group of birds is usually called a \"flock\" (this may also refer to certain mammals as well) and a large group of carnivores is usually called a \"pack\". \nIn addition, special collective nouns may be used for particular cases: for example a flock of geese, if not in flight, is sometimes called a gaggle. However, in theoretical discussions in behavioural ecology, the term \"herd\" is used for all these kinds of assemblage. A herd may also refer to one that tends and cares for such groups (e.i. shepherds tend to sheep, and goatherds tend to goats, etc.).\nWhen an association of animals (or, by extension, people) is described as a \"herd\", that means that the group tends to act together (for example, all moving in the same direction at a given time), but that this does not occur as a result of planning or co-ordination. Rather, each individual is choosing behaviour that corresponds to that of the majority of other members, possibly through imitation or possibly because all are responding to the same external circumstances. A herd can be contrasted with a co-ordinated group where individuals have distinct roles. Many human groupings, such as an army detachments or sports teams, show such co-ordination and differentiation of roles, but so do some animal groupings such as those of eusocial insects, which are co-ordinated through pheromones and other forms of animal communication. Conversely, some human groupings may behave more like herds."}

However, recent discoveries show that the Cetacea were descended from early artiodactyls. \nUngulates are typically herbivorous and many use specialised gut flora to digest cellulose. Some modern species, such as pigs, are omnivorous. Some prehistoric species, such as the Mesonychia, were carnivorous.\nUngulates include odd-toed ungulates such as horses, rhinoceroses and tapirs, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, sheep, deer, and hippopotamuses.

For all other uses see: Spectrum (disambiguation)\"\nA spectrum, plural: spectra, is a band of several colours: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. A spectrum can be seen if the Sun's light is passed through a prism and allowed to gather on a white screen. This visible spectrum is part of the larger electromagnetic spectrum. Spectroscopy is the study of spectra.\nA natural example of a spectrum is a rainbow. The word \"spectrum\" was first used by scientists studying optics. They used the word to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light when separated using a prism. The spectrum seen when light passes through a prism is an example of the dispersion of light. The material from which the prism is made has a different refractive index \"n\" than air. Usually, \"n\"prism is greater than \"n\"air, and \"n\"air is taken to be approximately one. This implies that light travels a little slower in the material of the prism than in the space surrounding it. The angle of refraction can be determined from the angle of incidence and the refractive indexes using Snell's law. \nThe reason why the white light separates into in its component colors instead of remaining white is because the shorter wavelengths are refracted, or bent, more than the longer wavelengths. Thus, red, having the longest visible wavelength, will appear closest to the line perpendicular to the surface of the material (the normal), that is, it will be bent the least. Violet light, with the smallest wavelength in the visible spectrum, will be bent the most. The rainbow produced will always be in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet."}

The third Hagia Sophia was built between 532 and 537, as the cathedral of Constantinople, the capital city of the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity. The Roman emperor Justinian the Great ordered the construction. The architects were Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus. The Greek historian Procopius wrote about Hagia Sophia's construction. The building's roof (a large dome) fell down not long after the church was complete. Justinian again ordered the church's completion. The dome broke apart and has been rebuilt many times, but the walls and floor of the building are the same as those of Justinian's time. The decorations, including mosaics and frescoes, are mostly from the Middle Ages.\nAfter an earthquake, Trdat the Architect finished rebuilding it again in 994. It was used as an Eastern Orthodox cathedral until 1453, except when it was the Roman Catholic cathedral between 1204 and 1261. The Ottoman sultan and caliph Mehmed the Conqueror converted Hagia Sophia into a mosque in 1453 after the Fall of Constantinople.\nIt became a museum in 1935 after the decision of the secularist Turkish government under Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in 1934. In July 2020, the Islamist Turkish government under Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ordered the Hagia Sophia to be turned back into a mosque following a supreme court annulment of a 1934 presidential decree that made it a museum."}

It was created by the International Phonetic Association in 1886, so that people could write down sounds of languages in a standard way. Linguists, language teachers, and translators use this system to show the pronunciation for words.\nWikipedia also uses the IPA to show how certain words are meant to be spoken. Most symbols are letters in the Latin alphabet, or variations of it. For example, the \"palatal approximant\" (the \"y\" in yesterday) is written with []. In IPA symbols can be written between slashes (called a broad transcription, e.g.\"little\" can be written as /l\u026atl/ ) or in square brackets (called a narrow transcription, e.g. \"little\" can be written [l\u026a\u027e\u026b], which is how specific groups say it). Narrow translation is more precise than broad.\nThe IPA has symbols only for sounds that are used normally in spoken languages. The Extended IPA is used to write down other sounds.\nThe IPA is sometimes changed, and symbols are added or taken away. Right now there are 107 different letters in the IPA. There are also 52 marks which are added to letters to change their sound. These marks are called \"diacritics\".\nHistory.\nIn 1886, a group of French and British language teachers formed the International Phonetic Association. These teachers used the Romic alphabet at first. They later changed the alphabet so that different languages would all write the same sounds with the same letters.\nUse of the alphabet.\nThe IPA is made to have one symbol for every sound. This means that every letter always makes the same one sound. This is different from English. In English, some letters make multiple sounds. For example, the letter &lt;x&gt; in English normally is spoken as two sounds ([ks]), but could also mean [gz] or [z].\nLetters.\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet has letters for three types of sounds: pulmonic consonants, non-pulmonic consonants, and vowels.\nPulmonic consonants.\nPulmonic consonants are made by blocking air coming from the lungs. Most consonants (and all English consonants) are pulmonic. The symbols for these sounds are arranged in a table. The rows show how the sound is made, and the columns show where it is made.\nNon-pulmonic consonants.\nNon-pulmonic consonants are made without air coming from the lungs. There are three types of non-pulmonic consonants. Implosive consonants are made by taking air into the mouth. Ejective consonants are made by forcing the air out of the voicebox instead of the lungs. Click consonants are made by creating an airtight pocket in the mouth and quickly releasing it."}

It is currently in modern-day southeastern Turkey.\nAccording to Anania Shirakatsi's \"Ashkharatsuyts\" (\"World Atlas,\" 7th century), Tsopk was the 2nd among the 15 provinces of Greater Armenia. It consisted of 8 cantons (\"gavars\"): Khordzyan, Hashtyank, Paghnatun, Balahovit, Tsopk (Shahunyats), Andzit, Degiq, and Gavreq (Goreq).\nTsopk was part of the kingdom of Urartu in the 8th-7th cc BC. After unifying the region with his kingdom in the early 700s BC, king Argishtis I of Urartu resettled many of its inhabitants to his newly built city of Erebuni (modern day Armenian capital Yerevan). Around 600 BC, Tsopk became part of the newly emerged ancient Armenian Kingdom of Orontids.\nAfter Alexander the Great's campaigns in 330s BC and the subsequent collapse of the Achaemenid Empire, Tsopk remained part of the newly independent kingdom of Greater Armenia. In the early 200s BC, at the instigation of the Seleucid Empire, which was trying to weaken the Armenian kingdom, Tsopk, along with Commagene, split from Greater Armenia, forming the Hellenistic kingdom of Tsopk-Commagene. The kingdom was ruled by a branch of the Armenian royal dynasty of Orontids. Tsopk later split from the Tsopk-Commagene kingdom as well, forming an independent kingdom.\nAround 200 BC, in his attempt to finally subjugate Armenia, Seleucian king Antiochus III conquered both Greater Armenia and Tsopk, installing Armenian generals Artaxias I and Zariadres as governors-strategoses respectively in each kingdom. Following Antiochus' defeat by Romans at the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, both Zareh and Artashes declared themselves independent kings. Zareh and his descendants ruled the kingdom of Tsopk until it was reunified with Greater Armenia by Tigranes the Great in the 80s BC.\nPompey gave Sophene to Tigranes, after defeating his father Tigranes the Great.\nSophene later become part of the Roman Empire, and was made into a province of the Roman Empire. The capital was Amida (modern Diyarbak\u0131r). Around 54, the province was ruled by Gaius Julius Sohaemus.\nIn 530, Sophene was included into the province of Armenia IV."}

Later on, much of this area became part of the Umayyad Empire and then the Abbasid Empire.\nThere were over 30 kings of the Seleucid dynasty from 323 to 63 BC.\nThe partition of Alexander's empire (323\u2013281 BC).\nAlexander the Great had conquered the Persian Empire but later died young, leaving his huge empire of partly Hellenized culture without an adult heir. \nThe empire was put under the management of a regent named Perdiccas in 323 BC, and the territories were divided between Alexander's generals, who thereby became satraps, at the Partition of Babylon. Leaders who thought they should have more, started wars to get it.

The Seleucid Empire quickly expanded, eventually taking parts of Thrace in the west and advancing past the Indus in the East. \nSeleucus I clashed several times with his southern rival for power, the Ptolemaic Dynasty. The Ptolemaic Dynasty controlled most of Egypt and the lands around it, and would fight the Seleucid Empire on many occasions for control of Syria. Seleucus I conquered much of Anatolia, and was preparing to invade Macedonia, when he was assassinated. This momentarily put an end to the Seleucid Empire's ambitions in Greece. After Seleucus I died, his heirs spent much of their time and money trying to maintain the enormous empire they had inherited. In this, they were rather successful, but the vastness of the empire defied attempts by the successors of Seleucus to control it effectively."}

Most counties began as Anglo-Saxon shires, and duchies.\nThe names, boundaries and functions of these divisions have changed many times. A series of local government reforms from the 19th century onwards has left the exact definition of the term 'county' unclear, and many counties have more than one definition in law.\nTherefore, the term \"counties of England\" does not refer to a unique set of names or boundaries. There are specific sets of counties that serve a purpose in government (e.g. ceremonial county, registration county or former postal county) or are cultural regions that are sometimes loosely defined (e.g. historic county).\nTwo definitions have a purpose in present-day government:\nFor example, Leicester is not in the administrative county of Leicestershire, but is in the ceremonial county of Leicestershire.\nHistoric counties.\nThe 39 historic, ancient or traditional counties, developed from the 12th to the 16th centuries, though many of the specific areas are much older. They were not used for census reporting since 1841. Most of the historic counties continue to form part of the local government structure, often with reformed boundaries.\nRegistration counties.\nRegistration counties existed from 1851 to 1930 and were used for census reporting from 1851 to 1911.\n1889 to 1974.\nElected county councils were set up in England in 1889, taking over many of the administrative functions of the Quarter Sessions courts, as well as being given other powers over the years. A County of London was created from parts of Kent, Middlesex and Surrey. The counties were divided into administrative counties (the area controlled by a county council) and independent county boroughs. Some counties were covered by several administrative counties; they were Suffolk, Sussex, Northamptonshire, Hampshire, Cambridgeshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.\n1965 saw a minor change as the original County of London became instead the 'administrative area' of Greater London.\nChanges in 1974.\nOn 1 April 1974 the Local Government Act 1972 came into force. This abolished the existing local government structure in England and Wales (except in Greater London) and replaced it with a new entirely two-tier system. It abolished the previously existing administrative counties and county boroughs (but not the previous non-administrative 'counties') and created a new set of 46 'counties' in England, 6 of which were metropolitan and 40 of which were non-metropolitan.\nSome of the counties established by the Act were entirely new, such as Avon, Cleveland, Cumbria, Hereford and Worcester, and Humberside, along with the new metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. The counties of Cumberland, Herefordshire, Rutland, Westmorland and Worcestershire were abolished and the county boroughs as well.\nA further local government reform in the 1990s grouped the counties into regions, created many small unitary authorities with county level status (re-establishing in effect if not in name the old county boroughs), and restored Herefordshire, Rutland and Worcestershire as administrative entities.\nThere are now 81 county level entities outside Greater London. Of these, 34 are so-called 'shire counties' with both county councils and district councils, and 40 are unitary authorities. Six are metropolitan counties. The remaining one is Berkshire, whose county council has been abolished and its districts have become unitary authorities.\nPost-1996 ceremonial counties.\nBecause of the local government reforms in the 1990s, the distinction between the counties used for local government and those used for Lieutenancy, abolished in 1974, was revived, and a new term, 'ceremonial county', coined. Most unitary authorities remained associated with the same county for Lieutenancy, and in a few areas the old ceremonial counties were restored (Bristol, East Riding of Yorkshire, Herefordshire, Rutland, Worcestershire).\nThese are also known as the geographic counties and are generally used to describe a place's location in England. They are also taken into consideration by the boundary commission when they draw up boundaries for constituencies, for example.\nPostal counties.\nThe former postal counties as used by the Post Office are no longer required on addresses. They included most of the 1974 changes, but did not acknowledge Greater Manchester or Greater London as postal counties. They went out of official use in 1996."}
{"id": "52444", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52444", "title": "Lord Lieutenant", "text": "The title Lord Lieutenant is given to the British monarch's personal representatives around the United Kingdom, usually in a county, with varying tasks throughout history. Usually a retired local notable, senior military officer, peer or business person is given the post honourarily. Both men and women are eligible for the post.\nOrigins.\nEngland and Wales.\nIn England and Wales and Ireland, the lord lieutenant was the principal officer of his county. His creation dates from the Tudors.\nLieutenants were first appointed to a number of English historic counties by Henry VIII in the 1540s, when the military functions of the sheriff were handed over to him. He raised was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of the county, and afterwards of the yeomanry, and volunteers. He was Commander of these forces and appointed their officers.\nLieutenancies became more organised soon, probably in the reign of his successor Edward VI, their establishment being approved by the English parliament in 1550. It was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of Spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties. After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the need for lieutenants was reduced \u2014 and the lieutenancies of some counties were left vacant in the 1590s.\nThe three ridings (sub-divisions) of Yorkshire each got their own.\nThe official title of the office at this time was His or Her Majesty's lieutenant for the county, but as almost all office-holders were peers they were referred to as \"lord-lieutenant\".\nThe Twentieth Century.\nThe Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 established County Territorial Force Associations, of which the lord-lieutenant was to be head. So the combination of counties and county corporates as lieutenancy counties was restored.\nLocal Government reform in England in 1965 led to the appointment of lord-lieutenants to Greater London and Huntingdon and Peterborough, and the abolition of those of the County of London, Middlesex and Huntingdonshire.\nA more fundamental reform of local government throughout England and Wales (outside Greater London) created a new structure of metropolitan, non-metropolitan and Welsh counties in 1974. Section 218 of the Local Government Act 1972 that established the new system stated: \"Her Majesty shall appoint a lord-lieutenant for each county in England and Wales and for Greater London...\" The Act appears to be the first statutory use of the term \"lord-lieutenant\" for lieutenants to counties.\nIn 1975 counties ceased to be used for local government purposes in Scotland. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 replaced the counties with regions, and each region was to have one or more lord-lieutenants appointed. The areas to which they were appointed approximated to the counties and were based and were defined in terms of the new local government districts.\nPresent-day.\nIn 1996 Scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation, and since that date lord-lieutenants have been appointed to lieutenancy areas.\nPartial reform of local government in England since 1995 has led to the creation of so-called ceremonial counties to which lord-lieutenants are now appointed. The Lieutenancies Act 1997 is the most recent piece of primary legislation dealing with Lieutenancies in England and includes the definitive list of the current areas used. Ceremonial counties may be comprised of combinations of county council areas and unitary authorities.\nSince the local government re-organisation of 1996 in Wales, lord-lieutenants are now appointed to preserved counties.\nThe City of London was unaffected by changes introduced since 1882. It has a Commission of Lieutenancy rather than a single Lord-Lieutenant. The Head of the Commission is the Lord Mayor of London.\nThe modern responsibilities of lord-lieutenants include:\nAs the sovereign's representative in his or her county, the Lord-Lieutenant remains non-political and holds no office in any political party. The usual age of retirement is 75. They are appointed for life, although the sovereign may remove them.\nThe Lord-Lieutenant is supported by a Vice Lord-Lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenants which he or she appoints. \nThey are unpaid, but receive minimal allowances for secretarial help, mileage allowance and a driver. Male Lord-Lieutenants receive an allowance for the ceremonial uniform, worn when receiving members of the royal family and on other formal occasions.\nThere is no uniform for a female Lord-Lieutenant, but there is a badge which can be worn on ceremonial occasions. Male Lord-Lieutenants wear a dark blue uniform in the style of an Army No. 1 dress along with a cap and sword with a steel scabbard. The uniform for a male Vice Lord-Lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenants is of a similar style, but with features to distinguish it from a Lord-Lieutenant.\nLord Lieutenant of Ireland.\nThe Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the head of the British administration in Ireland until the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922."}

This was thought hypothetically to fill empty space. The experiment showed the substance did not exist.\nThe experiment was done by Albert A. Michelson and Edward Morley in 1887.\nSince waves in water need something to move in (water) and sound waves do as well (air), it was believed that light also needed something to move in. Scientists in the 18th century named this substance \"aether\", after the Greek god of light. They believed that aether was all around us and that it also filled the vacuum of space. Michelson and Morley created this experiment to try and prove the theory that aether existed. They did this with a device called an interferometer. This experiment is a test of Einstein's special relativity theory.\nThe experiment.\nThe Earth travels very quickly (more than 100,000 km per hour) around the Sun. If aether exists, the Earth moving through it would cause a \"wind\" in the same way that there seems to be a wind outside a moving car. To a person in the car, the air outside the car would seem like a moving substance. In the same way, aether should seem like a moving substance to things on Earth. \nThe interferometer was designed to measure the speed and direction of the \"aether wind\" by measuring the difference between the speed of light traveling in different directions. It measured this difference by shining a beam of light into a mirror that was only partially coated in silver. Part of the beam would be reflected one way, and the rest would go the other. Those two parts would then be reflected back to where they were split apart, and recombined. By looking at interference patterns in the recombined beam of light, any changes in speed because of the aether wind could be seen.\nThey found that there was, in fact, no substantial difference in the measurements. This was puzzling to the scientific community at the time, and led to the creation of various new theories to explain the result. The most important was the Lorentz factor, which is used in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity."}

It often results when bacteria break down organic matter if there is no oxygen. This happens in swamps, and sewers (alongside the process of anaerobic digestion). It also happens in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. This is the smell that people often think to be that of sulfur. But sulfur itself does not smell.\nHydrogen sulfide is also known as sulfane, sulfur hydride, sour gas, sulfurated hydrogen, hydrosulfuric acid, sewer gas and stink damp. IUPAC accepts the names \"hydrogen sulfide\" and \"sulfane\". When people speak of more complicated compounds they always use the term \"sulfane\".\nOccurrence.\nSmall amounts of hydrogen sulfide can be found in crude petroleum. Sour natural gas can contain up to 28%. But, sour natural gas must be cleaned before it can enter a long distance pipeline. Pipelines limit hydrogen sulfide to 3 grains per thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Volcanoes and hot springs give off some H2S, where it probably is made by the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals, i.e. MS + H2O to give MO + H2S.\nNormal average concentration in clean air is about 0.0001-0.0002 ppm.\nSafety.\nHydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas. Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces.\nToxicity.\nHydrogen sulfide is considered a broad-spectrum poison, meaning that it can poison several different systems in the body, although the nervous system is most affected.

Being called a noob is usually not a good thing especially if its by an \"Epic Gamer\". \nHistory.\nThe use of the word \"newbie\" originated in World War II. It was a word veterans used to describe new recruits. \nIn recent years, however, the term has been used more often in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)s or other internet based games. It can also mean someone who has a high level in a game, but is not a skilled player. A person new to a game or a younger player can be referred to as a newbie. \nMany places, such as internet forums or online communities, use the word \"noob\" differently than the word \"newbie\". A newbie is simply someone who is new to the forum or game. But a noob or n00b is someone who has been around long enough to know better, but doesn't. A noob is thought of as having no respect for the rules and does not seem to want to do anything for himself. So noob has become an offensive term on the internet. To behave like a noob can mean getting disrespect and a lack of interest from other players.\nNoobs are usually referred to by the 1337 (pronounced \"leet\") or skilled players, who have marginally higher experience in the game. When a leet soundly defeats a noob, he is said to be \"pawning noobs\". Recently \"noob\" is used mainly just as a name to refer to other players in various online games. It's usually a derogatory term, but can be exchanged as a friendly greeting. A noob is sometimes confused with a \"choob\" (a low skilled person in a game, but having acquired nice things as a result of playing). "}

They have attained a certain level of enlightenment, but decide not to enter Nirvana so that they can continue helping living beings in the world. \nThe word Bodhisattva can also refer to certain specific bodhisattvas such as Avalokiteshvara, Manjushri and Vajrapani.\nMany bodhisattvas made a special vow that defines their personality or method of helping people. For example, Kshitigarbha vowed not to attain enlightenment until there were no more beings in hell. Some Buddhas, such as Amitabha, made certain vows when they were bodhisattvas. He became a Buddha when these vows were fulfilled. "}

Tolkien's Middle-earth universe.\nAinur.\nValar.\nManw\u00eb.\nManw\u00eb S\u00falimo is the leader of the Valar. He is the lord of air and sky. His wife is Varda. He lives on the mountain of Taniquetil in Valinor, which is far west of Middle-earth.\nMorgoth.\nMelkor was originally the most powerful of the Valar, but he became evil. He was then named Morgoth (Sindarin: \"Black Enemy\"), and \"Morgoth Bauglir\" (Sindarin: \"Oppressor\"). Morgoth was the greatest enemy of all the peoples of Middle-earth during the First Age. He is the main villain of \"The Silmarillion\".\nMaiar.\nSauron.\nSauron is a Maia who became evil. He became the Dark Lord Morgoth's chief lieutenant. In the Second Age he disguised himself as Annatar and told the elves how to make the Rings of Power. He created the One Ring in the volcano Mount Doom, in his land Mordor. Since then he is the Lord of the Rings. \nHe was killed in the Downfall of N\u00famenor, but again took form in Mordor. He was again defeated by the \"Last Alliance of Elves and Men\". Later in the Third Age, Sauron again came to life, searching for the Ring, and starting the \"War of the Ring\". Sauron was later defeated when the One Ring fell to the fires of Mount Doom with Gollum. Sauron is mentioned as the Necromancer in \"The Hobbit\".\nIstari.\nThe Istari (Quenya: \"Wise Ones\"; singular: Istar) are a group of five Maiar. They came to Middle-earth in the Third Age, in the form of old human men. The names of the Istari are (in order of rank) Saruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown, Alatar the Blue and Pallando the Blue. The peoples of Middle-earth gave them many names, and called them \"wizards\".\nGandalf.\nGandalf the Grey is a main character in the books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". In the Third Age Gandalf came to Middle-earth as one of the Istari (or wizards). He worked much to help in the destruction of the One Ring, and in the War of the Ring. Later in the Third Age during the War of the Ring, he was later reborn as \"Gandalf the White\"' and succeeded Saruman as the head of the Istari order. Gandalf is also known by other names: Ol\u00f3rin, Mithrandir, Thark\u00fbn, Inc\u00e1nus, Gandalf Stormcrow, Gandalf Greyhame, L\u00e1thspell, White Rider, The Grey Pilgrim, Old Greybeard, Gandalf the Wandering Wizard. C\u00edrdan gave Gandalf the Elven Ring Narya, the Ring of Fire, which he had been given by Gil-galad. At the end of the Third Age, Gandalf left Middle-earth for Valinor, together with the bearers of the other two Elven Rings and the Ring-bearers of the One Ring.\nSaruman.\nSaruman the White is a character in the book \"The Lord of the Rings\". In the Third Age Saruman came to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. Saruman is also known as Curumo, Sharkey, Curun\u00edr, Saruman of Many Colours, The White Wizard and Saruman the Wise by Gandalf the Grey. Saruman was the leader of the wizards and the White Council that opposed the Dark Lord Sauron. Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor and created an army of 10,000 Uruk-hai and many Isengard who bore his white hand on their faces and armories. Saruman was later expelled from the Order of Istari as its head by Gandalf who broke his black staff of power leaving him powerless. He later managed to convince the Ents who held him captive into letting him leave Isengard after he met the conditions of handing over the Keys of Orthanc. He then went to the Shire, which his ally Lotho Sackville-Baggins had brought under control. He spent his final days as a small-time criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the Orkish Shark\u00fb, meaning \"old man\"), until he was overthrown in the Battle of Bywater. In the aftermath of that battle Frodo confronted Saruman and exiled him from the Shire, but before he could leave, Gr\u00edma killed him by slitting his throat with a dagger, on the very doorstep of Bag End. \nRadagast.\nRadagast the Brown is a character in the book \"The Lord of the Rings\". In the Third Age Radagast came to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. Radagast is also known as Aiwendil, Bird-Friend, Tender of Beasts, \"the Birdtamer\", \"the Simple\", and \"the Fool\". Radagast was a dweller in Rhosgobel with his animal friends. But, by the time of the War of the Ring, he was not a Rhosgobel dweller anymore. Later on Midsummer's Day, Radagast was sitting on the side of the Greenway with his horse near Bree when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the Nazg\u00fbl were abroad, disguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of the Shire. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by getting beasts and birds to send news to Orthanc. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood. By sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured. Saruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in Orthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of Saruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of Gwaihir. Radagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the Council of Elrond, many scouts were sent out from Rivendell to many different locations. Some passed over the Misty Mountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but they found that Radagast was not there.[6] His fate after the War of the Ring is not known.\nAlatar and Pallando.\nAlatar the Blue and Pallando the Blue are the Blue Wizards. They went into the east of Middle-earth. Little is known about them. Alatar was originally a Maia of Orom\u00eb the Huntsman named Morinehtar, and presumably lived in his forests on the continent of Aman, west of Middle-earth. The other servants of Orom\u00eb included R\u00f3mest\u00e1mo (later Pallando), who was a friend of Morinehtar's, and whom he later chose to journey with him. At some point in the Second Age, around the forging of the Rings of Power, Mohrinehtar and R\u00f3mest\u00e1mo were chosen to become the first of the Istari, and were sent to the East of Middle-earth to stir up rebellion against Sauron and assist the few tribes of Men who had refused to worship Morgoth in the First Age. Before he came to Middle-earth, Pallando was a Maia of Orom\u00eb the Huntsman. He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another Istar who took him as a friend. During the Third Age, the Valar selected Morinehtar, renamed Alatar, meaning \"after-comer\", and Pallando to be two of the five Maiar to travel from the Undying Lands to Middle-earth and serve as Istari wizards. Alatar, Curumo (Saruman the White) and Ol\u00f3rin (Gandalf the Grey) were assigned the objective of encouraging the peoples of Middle-earth to oppose Sauron. However, two more joined the original three Wizards and they became five. Aiwendil (Radagast the Brown) was chosen by Yavanna to travel with Curumo, and Alatar took Pallando the Blue as a companion. Upon arrival in Middle-earth, Alatar and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue. Due to this, they were called the Blue Wizards (or Ithryn Luin, in Sindarin). With Saruman, they travelled east in an attempt to help free the last Men of N\u00famenor, who were now Haradrim and Easterlings. Later, Saruman came back to the west alone. However, Alatar and Pallando were never seen again, and their ultimate fates are unknown. Pallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes) traveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to aid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons who worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing. Saruman later returned to the West, but Pallando along with Alatar stayed behind.

It was used in the Middle Ages. With feudalism, all the land in a kingdom was the king's. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him, called vassals. These gifts of land were called fiefs.\nCharacteristics.\nUnder feudalism, taxes were not paid with money. They were paid in products and services. Presents and taxes had to be given to the lords by their vassals. At harvest time, the vassals gave shares of their crops to the lords. The vassals would grind their grain at the noble's granaries. They would give part of the grain to their lord. When animals were killed for food, part of the meat was given to the lords. The lords promised to give protection, peace, and safety to their vassals.\nNobles.\nManors were completely owned by the nobles. They were given from one generation to another. The noble's firstborn son took it all when his father died. Each manor had its own pasture lands, mill, wine press, church, and village. A manor had to let many people live there. Lords gave their servants food and a place to sleep, but they did not pay their servants money.\nVilleins.\nThe villein was in a poorer class. They had to serve the lords, but were free in other ways. They had work to do for the lord or the town. Then they went back to their little houses with floors made of earth and a thatched roof. On the walls of their houses, the villeins hung meats, tools, and dried vegetables.\nA villein was more free than slaves or serfs, but they still were not completely free. They could not move or marry if the lord didn't say yes. They also could not leave the manor lands if the lord said no. If they escaped, they could run away to a town where they could try to live quietly without being known, until he is discovered. If they did this, they become a free men. If they wanted to help the Catholic Church, they needed special permission. As a member of the church, their position could get higher. However, if this did not work, they could join a band of outlaws.\nSerfs.\nThe serfs were in the lowest class. They were only a little better than slaves. They could not be sold away from the land, but were always sold \"with\" the land.\nBut villeins and serfs had rights as well. They could cultivate grain and vegetables for sale, and the lord had duty to protect them and provide them land to cultivate. If they got wealthy enough, they could buy their freedom from the lord. They also did not need to serve in levy (that is: army mustered up by conscription) and they did not need to pay state taxes. They usually paid 10% of their income to the Church and 10% to the feudal lord, which was called a tithe.\nMarxism.\nAccording to Karl Marx, feudalism was the stage of society before capitalism and after slavery. When the lords and the serfs fought, feudalism ended and capitalism came into being. However, instead of the lords exploiting the serfs, now it was the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat."}

They correspond with the Hayasa-Azzi Tribes. The Armans united with the tribes of Hayasi. Recent linguistic studies present strong evidence that the Indo-European language group originates in Anatolia. According to most accounts, the Armens were generally tall, blond-haired, and blue-eyed in appearance, in contrast to their Urartian cousins who tended to be slighter with black hair and black eyes. The Urartian state, which existed there prior to the coming of the\nIndo-European-speaking \"Armen\" tribes from the west, was a federation of many peoples.\nHistory.\nAt the end of the second millennium BC, another Indo-European ethnic group, closely related to Thracians and Phrygians and referred to by the Greeks as Armens, migrated to the Armenian Highland from Northern Balkans.\nOne theory suggests that the Armens were of Thracian origin, and related to the Phrygians. The Armens were near the head waters of the Halys, to the west of the Euphrates. The Armens seemed to have mixed blood with another Asiatic element whose patronymic Hai, became in time their national designation. The country where the Armens settled were a mountainous region, traversed by deep valleys and smiling plains.\nEtymology.\nThe word Armani, (mentioned in Akkadian inscriptions as early as 2400 BC) an early form of Armen-Armin or Arman denotes the national affiliation, as with many cultures standing for the particular nation thus, the God AR being the primary deity in the Indo-European (aka Aryan) pantheon - thus AR MAN denotes\u2014Men of Ar or Children of Ar, again initially AR standing for ARAREL-ARARICH [hence Ar-Ar-At the Place of ARAR] -- Create-Creator, also Sun, Light, Life and Love."}

This last group, also knowns as Phrygians may have brought their Indo-European language to Armenia. The Armenian language today is Indo-European, but shows a lot of influence from the earlier languages, especially Urartean. \nAncient period.\nThe Armenians had friendly relations with the Parthian empire. The fighting between the Roman Empire and Parthia was centered in Armenia. Armenia was in between Parthian and the Roman Empire. The Armenians had already played a role in the early history of the Roman-Parthian relations. Tigranes put military and political relations with Rome and Parthia on an international legal foundation. The Parthians were allies to Armenians in many times. Many Parthian noble families had moved out and they went to Armenia. "}

Its creation with borders were the Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north, the Ottoman Empire to the west, the Persian Empire to the south, and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic to the east.\nEnd of the Republic, 1920.\nArmenia gave way to communist power in late 1920. In September 1920, the Turkish revolutionaries moved in on the capital. First an armistice was concluded, on November 18, and then a full peace treaty - Treaty of Alexandropol on 2nd and/or 3rd of December 1920.\nDuring that time, the Soviet 11th Red Army invasion started on the 29th of November 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan. Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum, presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran - who was at work as one of major Russian diplomats on Caucasus at that time. Armenia decided to join the Soviet sphere, while the Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, protect the Armenians, not to pursue non-communist Armenians. None of these promises were kept.\nOn December 4, 1920, the Red Army entered Yerevan, the government of Armenian Republic effectively stopped working. On December 5, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom; made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan) also entered the city. Finally, on the following day, December 6, Felix Dzerzhinsky's dreaded secret police, the Cheka, entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending the existence of the Democratic Republic of Armenia.\nThe rest of Armenia was under control of the communist government. The part by Turkey remained for the most part theirs - by the subsequent Treaty of Kars. Soon, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed, under the leadership of Aleksandr Miasnikyan.

He also began art shows in his store, to make people want to visit the store to see the art. In 1939, the company started a catalog, which is a book that shows all the products that people can buy from the store. In 1951, the catalog listed unusual gifts for people to buy. Many people started to read the catalog every year to see the unusual gifts.\nIn the 1940s, at the time of the Second World War, the government of the United States asked Mr. Marcus for help. The government wanted to make sure there would be enough fabric to make clothes for the military, so they asked Mr. Marcus to make rules about clothes for ordinary people. He made rules for companies that made clothes so that popular styles for women and men would not change every year. With these rules, people would not need new clothes so often. Also, he said that men's socks should not use rubber to make elastic to hold the socks in place. This rule made sure the government could use rubber for military products that were needed for the war.\nPersonal life.\nMr. Marcus married Mary \"Billie\" Cantrell in 1932.

It was part of Guadeloupe, which is an overseas \"r\u00e9gion\" and overseas \"d\u00e9partement\" of France. For this reason, it is part of the European Union. In 2003, the people voted in favour of becoming independent from Guadeloupe. They wanted to form a separate overseas collectivity (COM) of France. On February 7, 2007 the French Parliament passed a bill granting COM status to both Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy and neighbouring Saint-Martin. The new status took effect on 22 February 2007, when the law was published in the Official Journal. \nSt. Barts has long been considered a playground of the rich and famous and is known for its beautiful pristine beaches, gourmet dining in chic bistros and high-end designer shopping.\nGeography.\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy is about 150 miles east of Puerto RicoIt is near the islands of Saint Martin, Saba and Anguilla.\nGustavia, which is the main town of the island, was named after King Gustav III of Sweden, and remains as a reflection of the Swedish period.\nThe oldest settlement still remaining is the village of Lorient (or L'Orient), although scattered in every cemetery on the island are Swedish grave markers. Lorient's sister village on the French mainland is the city of Lorient on the northern coast of Brittany.\nBeaches.\nOf the 20 beaches on the small island, several are seen as especially inviting. On the southern side of the island, Saline and Governor beaches are pristine beaches with no development on them. On the western edge of the island is Colombier beach. This beach is only reachable by boat or a hike. St. Jean, Flammands and Grand-Cul-de-Sac beaches are also popular and attractive beaches which have hotels and other establishments on them. Shell Beach is popular for families with kids as it has little surf, and lots of tide pools. \nSt. Barths has a tidal difference of only 3 - 5\u00a0inches. The beaches vary according to ocean currents\u2014the weather travels onto the island following the sun from the East. One of the main surfing beaches (Toiny) is known for its riptide, while Grand Fond is one of the island's only non-swimming beaches. Although tourism does not allude to it, there are a small variety of warm water sharks in the Caribbean. So, swimming at dusk and dawn or in murky waters is not recommended. Otherwise, scuba and snorkeling are a great way to see the nurse sharks, lobsters, conch and green sea turtles that abound in the waters surrounding St. Barths.\nThe beach of Grand Cul-de-Sac is the easiest beach in the Caribbean to learn to sail, windsurf or kitesurf on, as it has a reef which closes off the entire bay. The current that passes outside the reef here also carries the migrating whales and dolphins.\nHistory.\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy was first claimed by France in 1648. It was sold to Sweden in 1784. Sweden sold it back to France in 1878. The Swedish period left its mark in the names of many of the streets and the town (in honor of King Gustav III). It also left its national arms, the three crowns along with the grey heron, in the island's coat of arms.\nDemographics.\nAt the 1999 census, Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy had 6,852 people. There were 326 people per square kilometer. Unlike most Caribbean islands, most of the people are white.\nMany of the people who live there all the time are French citizens who work at the various establishments on the island. French is the primary language spoken, but many locals also speak English, particularly at the hotels and restaurants.\nTransportation.\nSaint Barts has a small airport (IATA identifier SBH) is served by small regional commercial aircraft and charters. Most visiting aircraft carry fewer than twenty passengers, such as the Twin Otter, a common sight around Saint Barths and throughout the northern West Indies. The short airstrip is at the base of a steep hill ending directly on the beach. The arrival descent is extremely steep over the hilltop traffic circle and departing planes fly right over the heads of sunbathers (although small signs advise sunbathers not to lie directly at the end of the runway). The nearest commercial jet airport is on the neighboring island of Saint Martin. \nThere are also charters to St. Barths from San Juan, Puerto Rico available through Tradewind Aviation. The current mayor's airline, called St. Barths Commuter, offers non-prohibitive cost one-way/roundtrip travel between both of St. Maarten's airports and St. Barths. It is also an excellent service for charters. A favorite island business for an extra fee is via St. Barths Services, as they offer full-service attention.\nFerries to and from Saint Martin are the only other real option (although the passage from St. Maarten to St. Barths is often rough), unless one is arriving by private charter boats/yachts.\nTourism.\nSt. Barts has about 25 hotels, most of then with 15 rooms or fewer, and the largest, the Guanahani has just 70 rooms. Hotels are classified in the traditional French manner 3 Star, 4 Star and 4 Star Luxe. \nVilla vacations are extremely popular and there are hundreds of villas terraced into the hillsides throughout the island as well has many beachfront locations. Villas here by definition can range from one-bedroom bunglalows to large luxurious homes. St. Barth Properties and Wimco are the two main villa rental agencies on the island. \nSinger Jimmy Buffett is a frequent visitor on the island, and owns a house there. He also owned a hotel, the Author de Rocher, before it burned down.\nSports.\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy has its own bobsled team. To date the team has not achieved competitive success. The island also competes in carotchie.\nThe junior national French surf champion was named recently in the winter of 2006, and he is from Lorient."}

{"id": "52590", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52590", "title": "Hispaniola", "text": "Hispaniola is an island in the Caribbean Sea. It is the second largest island (after Cuba) of the West Indies, east of Cuba and west of Puerto Rico.\nThe Republic of Haiti occupies the western three-eighths, the Dominican Republic the rest. Hispaniola is one of two Caribbean islands in which there are two countries; the other is Saint Martin.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian history.\nWhen Columbus arrived to America, some groups of native people, coming from northern South America, had lived in the Caribbean Islands since a very long time. That movement from South America to the Caribbean islands was not continuous but it happened in several waves during almost twelve centuries.\nArcheological studies suggests that those people from South America came to the Caribbean islands during four periods.\nThe first period began around 5000 B.C. For most Caribbean islands, this period ended around 2000 years ago except in Cuba and Hispaniola where there were some small populations in western Cuba and southwestern Hispaniola when the Europeans arrived to these islands. They were called Ciboney or Siboney by the Ta\u00ednos, meaning \"man that lives among rocks\" (\"Ciba\" means stone and \"eyeri\" man).\nThe second group was the Igneri, the first Arawak Indians to come to the Caribbean Islands. They displaced the Ciboney people and, later, they were displaced by another group of Arawak Indians, the Ta\u00ednos. Ta\u00ednos occupied all the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico) and they developed a culture different from the culture of the Arawaks of South America. They were the first people that the Spanish met in the Americas.\nThe fourth and last group was the Carib. The Carib were also Arawaks but with a different language. Even if they used to go to Puerto Rico and the Hispaniola to fight against the Ta\u00ednos, they lived only in the Lesser Antilles when Columbus got to America.\nAt the moment when the Spanish came to the Hispaniola, most of the island was occupied by Ta\u00ednos; only in the western tip of the Southern Peninsula (in modern Haiti), there were some small groups of Ciboney In the northeastern part of the island (Saman\u00e1 Peninsula and north of the Northern mountain range), there was a group called Ciguayos, and sometimes Macorix, with the same culture of the Ta\u00ednos but a different language. It seems that they were Carib that took the Ta\u00edno culture. They were the first Indians that fought against the Europeans.\nDiscovery, conquest and colony.\nChristopher Columbus arrived to the island on December 5, 1492, naming it as La Espa\u00f1ola, meaning \"The Spanish Island\". When Peter Martyr d'Anghiera wrote in latin about this island, he wrote \"Hispaniola\", meaning \"Small Spain\"; that was not correct. Because the book of Anghiera was translated into English very soon, the name Hispaniola is the most used in English-speaking countries and in scientific works.\nFor centuries, other names were used for the island. The most common were \"Santo Domingo Island\" (the Dominican constitution still uses that name) and \"Haiti\".\nHispaniola was the only island that Columbus visited in all his four travels to the Americas. He saw the island for the first time on December 5, 1492 but he stayed on his ship during the night; the next day, he went to land. The Spaniards spent the rest of December traveling along the north coast of Haiti; on December 12, Columbus took possession of the island in the name of the King and Queen of Spain and named the island as \"La Espa\u00f1ola\".\nOn Christmas Eve, December 24, the main ship (\"Santa Mar\u00eda\") was badly damaged. The next day, Christmas Day, Columbus gave orders to use the wood of the ship to build a small fort on what is now M\u00f4le Saint-Nicolas, Haiti. That fort was named \"La Navidad\" (\"Navidad\" means Christmas) and was the first European building on American soil. Columbus left 39 men there because there was not space in the other two ships for all the people.\nFrom \"La Navidad\", they traveled east along the north coast of the island and in Saman\u00e1 they had a small fight with some natives (\"Ciguayos\", not Ta\u00edno Indians) and named the bay as \"Golfo de las Flechas\" (Gulf of the Arrows), but now is called \"Saman\u00e1 Bay\". From there, they went back to Spain.\nIn 1493, Columbus found, when he returned in his second trip, that \"La Navidad\" was destroyed by the Indians and all Spaniards killed. Then he went to the east, founding the first European city in the American continent, near the present city of Puerto Plata; he named the city \"La Isabela\" in honor of Queen Isabella of Castile. The first Catholic mass in America was celebrated at La Isabela on January 6, 1494. From La Isabela, Columbus sent groups of persons to explore and take control of the island.\nBecause La Isabela was an unhealthy site, Bartholomew Columbus, brother of Christopher, established a new city, \"La Nueva Isabela\" (The New Isabela) on the south coast of the island, on the left side of the Ozama river. Because a hurricane destroyed the city, it was built again but on the right side of the river and with the new name of Santo Domingo. It is the oldest permanent European city in the Americas.\nThe Ta\u00edno population of the island decreased very fast because a combination of new diseases, like smallpox, and abuses by the Spaniards. Even if some black slaves were brought from Spain since 1501, the colony began to import African slaves when the colony began to grow sugar cane, around 1516, to produce sugar.\nSpain kept conquering new regions of the Americas and, for the Spanish people, those new regions were more interesting because there was more gold; the population of the island grew very slowly. By the early 17th century, the island and its smaller neighbors (above all, the Tortuga island) became places often visited by Caribbean pirates. In 1606, the king of Spain gave the order that all inhabitants of Hispaniola had to move close to the city of Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates and Protestant people. This resulted in French, British and Dutch pirates establishing bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island.\nIn 1665, the presence of French people on the island had the official approval of the French king Louis XIV and he named Bertrand d'Ogeron as the governor of the western part of Hispaniola (in French, Saint-Domingue). By the Treaty of Ryswick, Spain gave the western third of the island to France and kept the eastern part. The development of the French \"Saint-Domingue\" was very fast, both in wealth and population, and it became the richest colony in the Caribbean. The eastern, Spanish colony of \"Santo Domingo\" remained poor and with a very low population.\nGeography.\nThe island of Hispaniola has an area of . There are two countries: the Republic of Haiti is in the western part of the island and the Dominican Republic in the eastern part. These two countries are separated by an artificial border, except in the northern and southern extremes where they are separated by the rivers Dajab\u00f3n and Pedernales, respectively.\nThe island is separated from Cuba by the Windward Passage (81\u00a0km from Punta Mais\u00ed in Cuba to Cape Saint-Nicolas in Haiti), from Jamaica by the Jamaica Channel ( from Point Morante in Jamaica to Cape Irois in Haiti) and from Puerto Rico by the Mona Channel, as from Punta Hig\u00fcero in Puerto Rico to Punta de Agua in the Dominican Republic.\nThe maximun length, east to west, is from Cape Enga\u00f1o to Cape Irois. The maximum width, north to south, is from Cape Isabela to Cape Beata. The highest point of the island, and of the Caribbean is Duarte Peak (\"Pico Duarte\") in the Dominican Republic with ; the lowest point is in the Enriquillo Lake, which is about under sea level.\nIslands.\nThere are many smaller islands around the Hispaniola. The largest are:\nMountains and valleys.\nThe Hispaniola is an island with many mountains, and the highest peaks of the West Indies are here. The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern peninsula (in Haiti) where they have a direction west-east. The mountains are separated by valleys with the same general direction.\nFrom north to south, the mountain ranges and valleys are:\nRivers and lakes.\nThe sources of the longest rivers of Hispaniola are in the mountains of the \"Cordillera Central\" (Dominican Republic) - \"Massif du Nord\" (Haiti).\nThe 10 longest rivers of the island are:\nThe largest lake of the Hispaniola, and of the West Indies, is the \"Lake Enriquillo\". It is in the \"Hoya de Enriquillo\" with an area of 265\u00a0km\u00b2. There are three small islands within the lake. It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a saline lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water.\nThe second largest lake, \"\u00c9tang Saum\u00e2tre\" (also known as \"Lake Azuei\"), is close to Lake Enriquillo but in Haiti, in the \"Cul-de-Sac\". It is also a saline lake with an area of around 170\u00a0km\u00b2.\nOthers lakes are \"Rinc\u00f3n\" (fresh water, area of 28.2\u00a0km\u00b2), \"Oviedo\" (brackish water, area of 28\u00a0km\u00b2), \"Redonda\" \"Lim\u00f3n\", \"\u00c9tang de Mirago\u00e2ne\".\nClimate.\nHispaniola has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the \"trade winds\" (winds that come from the northeast, from the Atlantic Ocean). At sea level, the average temperature is 25\u00a0\u00b0C, with small changes from one season to another. In the highest mountains, the temperature in winter can be as low as 0\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThere are two wet seasons: April-June and September-November. The most dry period is from December to March.\nRainfall varies greatly; eastern regions, like the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula, get an average of over 2,000\u00a0mm in a year, but less than 500\u00a0mm fall in the southwest (Hoya de Enriquillo - Cul-de-Sac).\nFrom June to November, hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the island.\nPopulation.\nHispaniola has a total population, estimated for July 2013, of 20,113,564 inhabitants, for a density of 263 inhabitants per km\u00b2.\nIn Haiti, 95% of the population belongs to the black ethnic group, and in the Dominican Republic it is about 70% of the population.\nIn the Dominican Republic, only Spanish is spoken (except for groups of immigrants) even if Haitian Creole is gaining importance because the massive immigration from Haiti. Both French and (Haitian) Creole are spoken in Haiti, and both are official languages.\nIn both countries, the main religion is Roman Catholicism. Protestant groups are important, more in Haiti (15% of the population) than in the Dominican Republic (5%).\nThe most important cities in the island are Santo Domingo (capital of Dominican Republic), Port-au-Prince (capital of Haiti), Santiago (Dominican Republic), Carrefour (Haiti)."}

By this definition, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta are classified as \"astika\" schools; while Charvaka, Jainism and Buddhism are considered \"nastika\" schools.\nIn non-technical usage, the term \"astika\" is sometimes loosely translated as \"theist\" while \"nastika\" is translated as \"atheist\". However this interpretation is distinct from the use of the term in Hindu philosophy. Notably even among the \"astika\" schools, \"samkhya\" and the early \"mimamsa\" school do not accept a God (see Atheism in Hinduism) while accepting the authority of the Vedas; they thus are \"atheistic \"astika\" schools\".\nThe three main heterodox schools of Indian philosophy do not base their beliefs on Vedic authority:\nThe use of the term \"nastika\" to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows:\nAt an early period, during the formation of the Upani\u015fads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions... These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (\"n\u0101stika\") by orthodox (\"\u0101stika\") Brahmanism.\nThe Tantric traditions in Hinduism, have both \"astika\" and \"nastika\" lines; as Banerji writes in \"\"Tantra in Bengal\":\nTantras are ... also divided as \"\u0101stika\" or Vedic and \"n\u0101stika\" or non-Vedic.

{"id": "52723", "revid": "1157808", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52723", "title": "Capsicum", "text": "Capsicum is a genus of plants from the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Some of these plants are used as spices, vegetables, or drugs. The fruit of \"Capsicum\" plants have a variety of names. The names vary depending on place and type. They are commonly called Chili pepper, red or green pepper, or just pepper in Britain and the US; the large mild form is called bell pepper in the US, capsicum in New Zealand English, Australian English and British English, and paprika in some other countries (although paprika can also refer to the powdered spice made from various capsicum fruit).\nCapsicums originated in the Americas, but are now grown worldwide.\nCapsaicin.\nThe fruit of \"most\" species of \"Capsicum\" contains capsaicin. Capsaicin is a chemical that can produce a strong burning sensation in the mouth (and, if not properly digested, anus) of the unaccustomed eater. Most mammals find this unpleasant; however, birds are unaffected. The plants developed the secretion of capsaicin to protect the fruit from being eaten by mammals. At the same time, the bright colors attract birds. These birds will spread the seeds. The amount of capsaicin in peppers is highly variable and dependent on genetics. This means that almost all types of peppers have varied amounts of heat felt by those consuming them. The only pepper without capsaicin is the bell pepper. Chili peppers are of great importance in Native American medicine. Capsaicin is also used in modern Western medicine to stimulate blood circulation or to relieve pain.\nBlack pepper and Sichuan pepper cause similar burning sensations. These are caused by different substances though \u2014piperine and hydroxy-alpha-sanshool, respectively.\nCuisine.\n\"Capsicum\" fruits and peppers can be eaten raw or cooked. Those used in cooking are generally varieties of the \"C. annul\" and \"C. pubescens\" species, though a few others are used as well. They are suitable for stuffing with fillings such as cheese, meat or rice.\nThey are also frequently used both chopped and raw in salads, or cooked in stir-fries or other mixed dishes. They can be sliced into strips and fried, roasted whole or in pieces, or chopped and incorporated into salsas or other sauces.\nThey can be preserved by drying or pickling. Dried peppers may be reconstituted whole, or processed into flakes or powders. Pickled or marinated peppers are frequently added to sandwiches or salads. Extracts can be made and incorporated into hot sauces.\nIn 2005, a poll of 2,000 people revealed peppers to be Britain's 4th favorite culinary vegetable.\nVarieties.\nMany varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways; for example, \"C. annual\" includes the \"bell pepper\" variety, which is sold in both its immature green state and its red, yellow or orange ripe state.\nThis same species has other varieties as well, such as the Anaheim chilly often used for stuffing, the dried Ancho chilly used to make chili powder, the mild-to-hot Jalape\u00f1o, and the smoked ripe Jalape\u00f1o, known as a Chipotle.\nMost of the capsaicin in a pepper is found in the interior ribs that divide the chambers of the fruit, and to which the seeds are attached. At the stem end of the pod, glands secrete the capsaicin, which then spreads throughout, but is concentrated on the ribs and seeds. The amount varies very significantly by variety, and is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU), ranging from the mild bell pepper to the scorching Habanero chile.\nSynonyms and common names.\nThe name given to the fruits varies between English-speaking countries.\nIn Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore and Hong Kong, heatless species are called \"capsicums\" while hot ones are called \"chilli/chillies\" (double L). The term \"bell peppers\" is rarely used, usually in reference to C. annuum and other varieties which look like a \"capsicum\" or bell but are fairly hot.\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada, the heatless varieties are called \"peppers\", \"sweet peppers\" or \"capsicums\" (or \"green peppers,\" \"red peppers,\" etc.) while the hot ones are \"chilli/chillies\" (double L) or \"chilli peppers\".\nIn the United States and Canada, the common heatless species is referred to as \"bell peppers,\" \"sweet peppers,\" \"red/green/etc peppers,\" or simply \"peppers\", while the hot species are collectively called \"chile/chiles,\" \"chili/chilies,\" or \"chili/chile peppers\" (one L only), \"hot peppers\", or named as a specific variety (e.g., banana pepper). In many midwestern regions of the United States the Sweet Bell Pepper is commonly called a mango. With the modern advent of fresh tropical fruit importers exposing a wider latitude of individuals to the tropical fruit variety of the Mango, this definition is becoming archaic. However many menus still call a stuffed Bell Pepper a \"Mango\".\nThe name \"pepper\" came into use because the plants were hot in the same sense as the condiment black pepper, \"Piper nigrum\". But there is no botanical relationship with this plant, nor with Sichuan Pepper.\nIn Spanish-speaking countries there are many different names for each variety and preparation. In Mexico the term \"chile\" is used. Several other countries, such as Chile, whose name is unrelated, Per\u00fa, and Argentina, use \"aj\u00ed\". In Spain, heatless varieties are called \"pimiento\" and hot varieties \"guindilla\".\nIn Indian English, the word \"capsicum\" is used exclusively for bell pepper. All other varieties of chili peppers are called chili. In northern India and Pakistan, bell pepper is also commonly called \"Shimla Mirch\" in the native languages. Shimla incidentally is a popular hill-station in India (and \"Mirch\" means chili in native languages).\nIn Polish, the word \"papryka\" is used for capsiscum fruit and dry spice (the word \"pieprz\" is used for black, red, and green pepper, but not for capsisum fruit or spice).\nIn Hungarian, the word \"paprika\" is used for capsicum fruit and dry spice.\nIn Israel capsicum is commonly called \"pilpel\", meaning pepper in Hebrew.\nYou can test how hot a hot pepper can be by using the Scoville scale.\nMedical Usage.\nCapsicum is excellent source of laxative (purgative) and pain relief. Capsaicin has also been studied for possible prostate cancer fighting effects."}

Its diet consists of termites and ants, hence the name. It is the largest anteater: its length is between 182\u00a0cm and 217\u00a0cm. Males weigh between 33 and 41\u00a0kg, female are 27 and 39\u00a0kg. This species lives on the ground, in contrast to other living anteaters and sloths which are arboreal or semi-arboreal. It forages in open areas and rests in more forested habitats.\nMode of life.\nThe giant anteater is adapted to eat termites and ants, and does not have any teeth in its mouth. It uses its front claws to dig them up and its long, sticky tongue to collect them. They eat about 30,000 ants and termites every day.\nThe tongue can reach up to , longer than the length of the skull, and move in and out around 160 times per minute (nearly three times per second). The anteater's tongue has little to no attachments to the hyoid and this is what allows it to flick its tongue at such distances and speed. The hyoid apparatus is large, V-shaped and flexible and supports the tongue as it goes in and out of the mouth. Before being swallowed, insects are crushed against the palate.\nThe giant anteater knuckle-walks, meaning its front toes are curled under like a fist when it moves. It is one of only a few animals other than primates that do this."}

The term originally meant the innovators and manufacturers of silicon chip who worked here, but now means all the high-tech businesses in the area. Even though it's not truly a valley, it is a term for the high-tech sector generally.\nSilicon Valley includes the northern part of Santa Clara Valley and adjacent communities in the southern parts of the San Francisco Peninsula and East Bay. It reaches from Menlo Park (on the Peninsula) and the Fremont/Newark area in the East Bay down to San Jose.\nCurrently, many locations in Silicon Valley are full of tourists.\nOrigin of the term.\nThe term \"Silicon Valley\" was coined by journalist Don Hoefler in 1971. He used it as the title of a series of articles \"Silicon Valley USA\" in a weekly trade newspaper Electronic News which started with the January 11, 1971 issue. \"Valley\" refers to the Santa Clara Valley, located at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, while \"Silicon\" refers to the high concentration of semiconductor and computer-related industries in the area. These and similar technology firms slowly replaced the orchards which gave the area its initial nickname, the \"Valley of Heart's Delight\".\nHistory.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area had long been a major site of U.S. Navy work, as well as the site of the Navy's large research airfield at Moffett Field. A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett to serve the Navy. When the Navy moved most of its West Coast operations to San Diego, NASA took over portions of Moffett for aeronautics research. Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in. The immediate area was soon filled with aerospace firms.\nHowever, there was almost no civilian \"high-tech\" industry in the area. Although there were a number of excellent schools in the area, graduating students almost always moved east or south (that is, to Los Angeles County) to find work. This was particularly annoying to Frederick Terman, a professor at Stanford University. He decided that a vast area of unused Stanford land was perfect for real estate development, and set up a program to encourage students to stay in the area by enabling them to easily find venture capital. One of the major success stories of the program was that it convinced two students to stay in the area, William Hewlett and David Packard. In 1939, they founded Hewlett-Packard in Packard's garage, which would go on to be one of the first \"high tech\" firms in the area that was not directly related to NASA or the U.S. Navy.\nNotable companies.\nThousands of high technology companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley; among those, the following are in the Fortune 1000:\nAdditional notable companies headquartered (or with a significant presence) in Silicon Valley include (some defunct or subsumed):\nBefitting its heritage, Silicon Valley is home to the high-tech superstore chain Fry's Electronics.\n\"For a larger list of companies, see \"\nUniversities.\nTechnically the following universities are not located in Silicon Valley, but have been instrumental as sources of research and new graduates:\nCities.\nA number of cities are located in Silicon Valley (in alphabetical order):\nCities sometimes associated with the region:\nTrivia.\nIn the James Bond film \"A View to a Kill\", villain Max Zorin plans to destroy Silicon Valley by detonating explosives between the \"Hayward Fault\" and \"San Andreas Fault\", causing them to flood. He dubs the operation 'Main Strike' in order to gain complete control of the microchip market by selling his own and destroying the competition."}

When Prime Minister, he acted as his own Foreign Minister.\nLord Cecil was elected to Parliament in 1853 as a member of the Conservative Party. In 1866 (now called Viscount Cranborne), he served as Secretary of State for India under Prime Minister Lord Derby. Cranborne resigned, but he would return to government in 1874, now as the Marquess of Salisbury. Salisbury was again Secretary of State for India under Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. In 1878, Salisbury became Foreign Secretary in the Disraeli government.\nSalisbury became the Conservative Party leader. Salisbury first served as Prime Minister from 23 June 1885, to 28 January 1886.

He would be in office until 11 August 1892. His third time as Prime Minister was from 25 June 1895, until 11 July 1902.\nTwo issues dominated his time as Prime Minister. One was the struggle between European powers seizing parts of Africa, the so-called \"Scramble for Africa\". The United Kingdom fought the Second Boer War while Salisbury was Prime Minister.\nThe other was Ireland, the rise of Irish nationalism amongst Catholics in Ireland. This was backed by his great opponent, Gladstone, leader of the Liberal Party and also three times Prime Minister.\nSalisbury helped establish the London County Council. Salisbury built up the Royal Navy. Africa was divided up into colonies. \nSalisbury resigned on 11 July 1902. He died on 22 August 1903. The great issues that had divided the country in his time (colonialism, Ireland and Africa) would last in British politics for most of the next century. The one great issue that was not appreciated at the time was the rise of militant German nationalism, which would in the next century lead to two World Wars.

In the Liberal administration that followed, Rosebery served in junior offices, including that of Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, before entering the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal in March 1885.\nRosebery became a leader of the Liberal Imperialist faction of the Liberal Party, and in Gladstone's third (1886) and fourth (1892\u20131894) administrations, Rosebery served as Foreign Secretary.

Rosebery's government was largely unsuccessful\u2014his designs in foreign policy, such as expansion of the fleet, were defeated by disagreements within the Liberal Party, while the Tory-dominated House of Lords stopped the whole of the Liberals' domestic legislation. In 1895, Rosebery resigned, and a Conservative government under Lord Salisbury took his place.\nRosebery resigned as leader of the Liberal Party in 1896, and gradually moved further and further from the mainstream of the party, supporting the Boer War and opposing Irish Home Rule, a position which prevented him from taking part in the Liberal government that returned to power in 1905.

The suggestion was that Queensberry had threatened to expose the Prime Minister if his government did not vigorously prosecute Wilde for Wilde's relationship with Francis Douglas's younger brother, Lord Alfred Douglas. Queensberry believed, as he put it in a letter, that \"Snob Queers like Rosebery\" had corrupted his sons, and he held Rosebery indirectly responsible for Drumlanrig's death."}

A canton is similar to a state in the United States.\nIn the past, each canton had its own army and money. This changed in 1848 when Switzerland finished a civil war and changed to the structure it has now.\nThe cantons Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden (Nidwalden and Obwalden together are called \"Unterwalden\") are called \"Urkantone\". An Urkanton is a canton that existed since the foundation of Switzerland in 1291. With time, other cantons joined Switzerland. \"Jura\" is the newest canton in Switzerland since 1978. In that year, it split from the canton of Berne, after some rioting.\nThe cantons of Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Appenzell-Innerrhoden, Appenzell-Ausserrhoden, Obwalden and Nidwalden are different from the others in one way. For historical reasons, their voting is counted differently in national elections. Other than that, they are the same as the others.\nIn Switzerland, the individual municipalities and cantons are very free. Usually, there is a Swiss law (at the level of the whole confederation). Very often this states general things and says that the cantons must follow this rule. The cantons then make detailed rules, each in the way it sees fit. Sometimes this leads to strange situations. There are 26 different schooling systems.\nDrug abuse is a federal offense. Punishment is usually one to three years, but can also be only a fine. The problem is: Consumption itself (not trading, or giving away for free) is not punishable. Also in light cases, the police can say that there will be no fine. This has led to the fact, that in each canton, this law is applied differently. In one canton, smoking marijuana will mean a fine, in another, it can mean a prison term.\nThe word for that is called federalism. That means, that each canton has its own government. So all cantons have their own constitution. The constitution is the highest law in a state.\nList and map.\nThe cantons are listed in the order given in the federal constitution.\nNotes: 1 As of 31 December 2001, National Statistics, 2 km\u00b2, 3 per km\u00b2, based on 2000 population 4 seat of government and parliament, the seat of the judicial authorities is Trogen.\nThe two-letter abbreviations for Swiss cantons are widely used, e.g. on car license plates and in the ISO 3166-2 codes (with the prefix \"CH-\", i.e. CH-SZ for the canton of Schwyz)."}

Like his father, Alexandre Dumas, fils was a celebrated author and playwright.\nAlexandre Dumas \"fils\" was born in Paris, France, the illegitimate child of Marie-Catherine Labay, a dressmaker, and novelist Alexandre Dumas. In 1831 his father legally recognized him (he adopted him) and ensured the young Dumas received the best education possible at the Institution Goubaux and the College Bourbon. At that time, the law allowed the elder Dumas to take the child away from his mother. Her agony inspired Dumas \"fils\" to write about tragic female characters. In almost all of his writings, he emphasized the moral purpose of literature and in his 1858 play, \"Le fils naturel\" (\"The Illegitimate Son\"), he wrote about the belief that if a man fathers an illegitimate child, then he has an obligation to legitimize the child and marry the woman.\nDumas' paternal great-grandparents were a white French nobleman and a young black Haitian woman. In the boarding schools, Dumas \"fils\" was constantly taunted by his classmates. These issues all profoundly influenced his thoughts, behaviour, and writing.\nIn 1844, Dumas \"fils\" moved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye to live with his father. There, he met Marie Duplessis, a young courtesan who would be the inspiration for his romantic novel, \"La dame aux cam\u00e9lias\" (\"The Lady of the Camellias\"). Adapted into a play, it was titled in English (especially in the United States) as \"Camille\" and is the basis for Verdi's 1853 opera, \"La Traviata\". Although he admitted that he had done the adaptation because he needed the money, he had a huge success with the play. With this work began the playwriting career of Dumas \"fils\" which not only eclipsed that of his father during his lifetime but also dominated the serious French stage for most of the second half of the nineteenth century. After this, he virtually abandoned the novel (though his semi-autobiographical \"L'Affaire Clemenceau\" (1867) achieved some success).\nIn 1864, Dumas married Nadeja Naryschkine, with whom he had a daughter. After Naryschkine's death, he married Henriette Regnier.\nIn 1874, he was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise and in 1894 he was awarded the \"L\u00e9gion d'Honneur\".\nAlexandre Dumas the son died at Marly-le-Roi, Yvelines, on 27 November 1895 and was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre in Paris. It was, perhaps coincidentally, only some 100 metres away from Marie Duplessis."}

The Archimedes principle says that the force holding up an object that is inside a liquid in part or totally. So, a ship actually does sink, until it moves an amount of water that is the same weight of the weight of the ship. The weight must be over a wide area to work. This explains why ships and boats (including submarines) float. An object's weight pulls down in the direction of gravity, but the water's buoyant (floating) force pushes it up. Because these forces counteract each other, the object seems to lose weight. NASA uses this principle to prepare their astronauts for the weightlessness of space, so they had the astronauts work on parts of the space ship inside water tanks 25 feet (7.6 m) deep.\nTerms.\nBow is the frontmost part of the hull\nStern is the rear-most part of the hull\nPortside is the left side of the boat when facing the Bow\nStarboard is the right side of the boat when facing the Bow\nWaterline is an imaginary line circumscribing the hull that matches the surface of the water when the hull is not moving.\nMidships is the midpoint of the LWL (see below). \nIt is half-way from the forwardmost point on the waterline to the rear-most point on the waterline.\nBaseline an imaginary reference line used to measure vertical distances from.

It comes from the Spanish word for \"float\", \"boyar\". Buoyancy is made by the difference in pressure put on the object by the Fluid or air that the object is in.\nThe net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid that is displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter. Buoyancy is important for many vehicles such as boats, ships, balloons, and blimps. \nDensity.\nIf the object has exactly the same density as the liquid, then its buoyancy is the same as its weight. It will not sink or float.\nIf the object has a higher average density than the liquid, then its buoyancy is less than its weight. It will sink. That is why pebbles do not float. \nIf the object has a lower average density than the liquid, then its buoyancy is greater than its weight. That is why, although a ship may be made of steel which is more dense than water, it floats because it encloses a volume of air and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water."}

But this was not always that way. The idea of the Asuras is very, very old, from long before the time people learned how to read and write. The Asuras only became demons after much time had passed. Buddhism also has Asuras. These are from Hinduism but have also changed a lot in their own way.\nSome of the Asuras are very important, and have been worshiped for thousands of years. The most important of these are Varuna and Mitra. Varuna is the god of the ocean, which in olden times was thought to be flowing under the earth. So, Varuna came to be seen as god of the underworld. In ancient times, water was thought to be where wisdom came from. So Varuna is considered very wise, and he gives his wisdom to those who honor him. Varuna's closest companion is Mitra. Mitra mostly means \"friend\" in Hinduism, but it originally meant \"promise\". And so Mitra is the god of friendships and promises. He protects people who honor the truth and punishes those who tell lies. The \"Mi-\" in \"Mitra\" means \"to tie tightly\". Friendship and promises tie people to one another.\nIn Hinduism.\nIn Hinduism, the Asura (Sanskrit: \u0905\u0938\u0941\u0930) are a group of creatures looking for more power, sometimes called demons. They went against the devas. The devas and asuras are the children of \"Kashyapa\". \nHinduism has many stories of Asuras and Devas fighting each other. Mostly they fight about who will get the best prayers from the worshipers.\nIn Hinduism the Asuras are said to be beings of moral and social things. Like truth and marriage. The Daevas are said to be beings of natural things. Like the sun and the rain. In Hinduism, the Asuras are said to be \"older\". And the daevas are said to be \"younger\". There are very many Asuras and Daevas. Two hundred years ago someone counted them and said there were over 2,000 Daevas and Asuras. So naturally not all Asuras are very important. But some names have been forgotten since then, and others have been added. This is why Hinduism is called a \"living religion.\" It is changing all the time. \nIn Buddhism.\nThe Asuras are partly\u2014but not completely -- demonic in Buddhism. Buddhism takes the basic idea from Hinduism.\nMostly the Asuras of Buddhism represent some mental state of humans that is not nice. For example, anger or pride or violence. There are many different kinds of Asuras. They are always angry with everyone and are always fighting. Their leaders are called the Asurendra, which means \"Lord of Asuras\".\nThe Asuras are almost human in their emotions. On the Buddhist scale of supernatural beings, the Asuras are almost at the bottom.\nBuddhism is very popular in the far east. So, many of the Asuras also have Japanese, Chinese and Korean names.\nIn the Vedas.\nThe Vedas are the most holy books of the Indian religions, especially of Hinduism. There are four Vedas, and they are all very, very old. The oldest of the Vedas is called the RigVeda, and it is more than 3,000 years old. \nIn the RigVeda the Asuras are not yet demons. At that time the Asuras and the Devas were both still groups of gods. In fact, many of the figures of the RigVeda are both \"asura\"s \"and\" \"daeva\"s. This is because, at that time, the two words were not yet names of groups. They were just names of characteristics. \"Asura\" means \"life\", and so the gods who were called \"asura\"s were thought to give life. And the \"daeva\"s were shining. This is the original meaning of the names. In later books they became different. \nIn the RigVeda many of the devas are called asuras, and many of the asuras are called devas. Sometimes they are also called both at the same time: Like \"daev\"ic\" asuras\" or \"asur\"ic\" devas\". The \"-\"ic\"\" makes those words a part of the other word. There are some beings who are both ahuric daevas \"and\" daevic ahuras. This shows that there was no big difference between 'ahura' and 'daeva' in the RigVeda.\nThe forefathers of the people who wrote the Vedas spoke Sanskrit. Sanskrit is the source of many Indian languages. The stories in the Rig Veda are seen in the books of various North Indian peoples, and also in the books of some Iranian peoples like the Zoroastrians.\nOne of the books of the Iranian peoples is called the Avesta. It is not really one book, but a collection of many books, but together they are called the Avesta. The Avesta is the holy book of Zoroastrianism. The language of the Avesta is very similar to the language of the RigVeda. The Avesta also has asuras and devas. But in Iran they are written as \"ahura\" and \"daeva\".\nThe old part of the Avesta is almost as old as the RigVeda. In this old part of the Avesta the ahuras and the daevas are almost like they are in the RigVeda. In both books they are groups of supernatural beings. But they are very different in character.\nSome time after the RigVeda was written, stories were told about the asuras and devas that made them not friends any more. A similar thing also happened in the Avesta. Only that the two groups had been switched: The Asuras became demons in regions where North Indian languages were spoken, and the Daevas became demons in regions where Iranian languages were spoken.\nIt is not known for sure why this happened. It was a very, very long time ago. \nOne possible reason why the Asuras became demons in India is this: Some time after the RigVeda was written Indians started to think that \"asura\" means \"a-sura\", which means \"not a hero\". So, maybe that way the \"asura\"s got a bad name. \nOne possible reason why the Daevas became demons in Iran is this: At about the same time as the Indians were writing the last part of the RigVeda, a very thoughtful man named Zoroaster appeared in Iran. He thought and thought a lot about why there was goodness and badness in the world. Finally, he told everyone what he had been thinking about. And one of those things was that Daevas were not to be trusted because they could not tell the difference between truth and lies. After some time Zoroaster became very popular for his ideas. And so, with time, the Daevas became demons in Iran. \nIn both cases, the one side did not know what the other side was thinking. So in India only the Asuras became demons. And in Iran only the Daevas became demons.\nMany, many centuries before the RigVeda and before Zoroaster, a name that sounds like \"Asura\" was the proper name of a very mighty god. Some scholars say his name was \"Ansu\" but this is not sure. So that is why they write the name as \"*Ansu\". That '*' means it is not sure. *Ansu was the god of life from which the name 'asura' and 'ahura' comes. We know that this god existed because far, far away in Northern Europe there was also a god named 'Aesir', who was also a giver of life. It sometimes can happen that a similar name appears in two or three places. But it is very rare that the same name with the same function appears. So, that is why 'Asura' and 'Ahura' and 'Aesir' must be all come from '*Ansu'. And we know that such a god must have been very powerful because he was very popular for so very long.\nAlthough the Asuras and the Ahuras are related, they should not be mixed up. This is not only because their names are slightly different. It is also because they are very different. But the most important thing is that they are from different cultures. Even if they came from the same place, that was very long ago. After such a long much time, people have very different ideas about them."}

Very often, the reference point is mean sea level, the level of the ocean midway between high and low tide on an average day. Most land has a positive elevation, which means it is above sea level. A few desert places are below sea level, thus have negative elevation.\nSometimes elevation is measured against the center of the earth. The problem there is that the geoid, the shape of the earth, does not really look like a ball, it is slightly squashed (an oblate spheroid). This means, that while still at mean sea level (at the equator), some points are farther away from the center of the earth than others. That way the peak of Chimborazo, a volcano in Ecuador is farther away from the center of the earth than the peak of Mount Everest. Yet, Mount Everest is higher above sea level."}

Approximately 1 to 2% of the world's population has red hair.\nIn iceland people that have red hair are called Anton Einar or short name for it l\u00fa\u00f0i\nRed hair is made by genes. The gene for red hair is recessive, meaning to be weaker than other genes, like the brown hair gene, for example. Because of this, in order to have natural red hair a person needs to have red-haired ancestors present on both the maternal (mother's) and paternal (father's) side of the family.\nRed hair is said to be most common close to the Northern European coasts and islands of the Atlantic Ocean, like British Isles, and in particular among Celtic people.\nIn Ireland, the percentage of population with red hair is very high relative to the rest of the world at around 10%, with 46% carrying the gene. Parts of the United Kingdom such as Scotland also have very high percentages with around 6%. There was a misconception that red hair occurrence in Scotland ran at around 13%, due to this figure appearing in reliable media sources, however this figure was only an estimate and has since been disproved by research. Dr. Jim Wilson of Britain's DNA has carried out the only large scale genetic study of Red Hair using a sample of over 2,343 people; and has found red hair occurrence of 6% in Scotland, this is concurrent with the largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland which analysed over half a million people and found red hair prevalence of 5.3%. A 1956 study of hair color among British army recruits also found high levels of red hair in Wales and the English Border counties.\nDepite all this, the US has the largest number of redheads living there in the world (up to 18 million compared to 650,000 redheads living in Scotland).\nIn some countries, particularly the British Isles, despite the high proportion of redheads there, redheads are sometimes given rude names such as \"carrot-top\" and \"ginga\", and are in some cases heavily ridiculed (made fun of) by their peers. In some extreme cases, people have been harassed (others have behaved threateningly towards them) for having red hair."}

He is perhaps best known as a television and radio news journalist over three decades. Spencer-Thomas combined this career with that of ordained Anglican clergyman and charity fundraiser. He is married to Maggie; they have three adult children, two sons and a daughter. \nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHe graduated in sociology at The Polytechnic, Regent Street, (now the University of Westminster) where he helped to establish its Students' Union and became its first elected President in 1966. He continued his studies at Westcott House and Fitzwilliam College in the University of Cambridge. His father, Ivor Spencer-Thomas, held the feudal barony of Buquhollie and Freswick in Caithness, Scotland.\nMedia.\nHe has wide experience in the field of communications - mainly in television and radio broadcasting as a news journalist. Joining Anglia Television in 1978 as senior reporter on the regional magazine programme \"About Anglia\", he became news bulletin editor of \"Anglia News\" in 1992. He also presented Anglia Television\u2019s late night religious programme \"Reflections\". He has been a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's \"You and Yours\" and \"Sunday\" programmes and has presented religious and ethics programmes on Thames Television and Southern Television. He has reported for Independent Television News. \nHe devised and presented the popular \"Sounding Brass\" radio phone-in programme which was later fronted by Gloria Hunniford on BBC Radio 2. His radio biographies appealed to a wide audience and his portrayal in 1978 of the outspoken television personality, panellist and quizmaster, Gilbert Harding, was widely acclaimed. \nAn innovative programme producer, Spencer-Thomas recorded two half-hour interview programmes with Kenneth Williams in which the comic actor, who rarely revealed his private life, spoke frankly about his early days and his feelings of loneliness, despondency and underachievement. Carry On Kenneth also featured skilfully chosen clips from the famous Carry On films, in which Williams starred, adding a gentle humour to the probing interview questions. \nHis award-winning documentary \"Underneath the Arches\" broke tradition by enabling London\u2019s homeless people to tell their own stories without any links from a programme presenter. Instead, short clips from catchy music hall songs were used to establish each location and, with careful editing, the interviewees related their own experiences and introduced each other.

He is known for books including Desert Solitaire, Black Sun, The Journey Home, The Fool's Progress, and Hayduke Lives.\nEarly life and education.\nHe was born in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States in 1927. He grew up in Pennsylvania, in a small town in the mountains near the city of Pittsburgh. He later moved to the American Southwest and wrote several books. He spent most of his adult life in the states of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. Most of his books are about the Southwest.\nDuring World War II, he was in high school. He took a trip hitchhiking to see the American West. During his trip through Arizona and New Mexico, he fell in love with the Southwest. He enlisted near the end of World War II and was stationed in Italy as a military policeman. When he came back to the United States, he moved to New Mexico and got a college degree. Then he started writing books.\nWriting works.\nAbbey's first book was titled \"Jonathan Troy\". It did not sell well and Abbey did not like it very much, and it was taken out of print. His second book was \"The Brave Cowboy\". This book sold better and made him known as a writer of western fiction. It was also made into a movie called \"Lonely are the Brave\". \"Fire on the Mountain\" was his third book. \"The Brave Cowboy\" and \"Fire on the Mountain\" are about cowboys who loved the old American West and did not like it becoming modernized.\nHe moved to New Jersey for a short time but did not like it, and moved back to the Southwest. He took a job as a park ranger in Utah. He wrote about his job as a park ranger in his fourth book, \"Desert Solitaire\". \"Desert Solitaire\" became a bestseller and made him a popular nature writer. He also took other jobs in the Southwest. He worked as a fire lookout at the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and as a park ranger in other National Parks.\nAfter \"Desert Solitaire\" became a bestseller, he wrote several books of nature essays. Some of these include \"The Journey Home\", \"Abbey's Road\", \"Down the River\", \"Beyond the Wall\", and \"One Life At a Time, Please\". He also kept writing novels. His next novel was \"Black Sun\", which is about a fire lookout at the Grand Canyon falling in love but then seeing his girlfriend disappear. His next novel after that was \"The Monkey Wrench Gang\". This was his most controversial novel because it was about four people using sabotage to stop development in the Southwest. He also wrote a science fiction novel called \"Good News\".\nHis last two novels were \"The Fool's Progress\" and \"Hayduke Lives\". \"The Fool's Progress\" is a long novel that is based on Edward Abbey's own life. \"Hayduke Lives\" is a sequel to \"The Monkey Wrench Gang\".\nAbbey died in 1989 and was buried in the desert in Arizona."}

The 2001 census also included Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire in the Midlands but these are not generally considered to be part of the Midlands but East Anglia.\nThere are two administrative regions of England in the Midlands: West Midlands and East Midlands.

South Cheshire has strong links with North Staffordshire (definitely in the Midlands), and North Cheshire with Merseyside and Manchester (both definitely in Northern England). Officially Cheshire is now part of the North West region.\nThe largest Midlands conurbation, which includes the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton, is approximately covered by a metropolitan county (which also includes Coventry) also called the West Midlands. Thus, there are two West Midlands, a Region and a (smaller) County.\nParts of the East Midlands are also densely populated, particularly the triangle formed by the cities of Leicester, Nottingham and Derby.\nThe South Midlands have an own government for development. They include Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire with northern Buckinghamshire. In other context Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire are not considered part of the Midlands.

It is named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745\u20131827), who invented the voltaic pile, the first chemical battery.\nDefinition.\nThe volt is defined as the potential difference across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power. Hence, it is the base SI representation m2 \u00b7 kg \u00b7 s\u22123 \u00b7 A\u22121, which can be equally represented as one joule of energy per coulomb of charge, J/C.\nHydraulic analogy.\nIn the \"hydraulic analogy\" sometimes used to explain electric circuits by comparing them to water-filled pipes, voltage is like water pressure - it determines how fast the electrons will travel through the circuit. Current (in amperes), in the same analogy, is a measure of the volume of water that flows past a given point, the rate of which is determined by the voltage, and the total output measured in watts. The equation that brings all three components together is: volts \u00d7 amperes = watts\nCommon voltages.\nNominal voltages of familiar sources:\nNote: Where 'RMS' (root mean square) is stated above, the peak voltage is formula_2 times greater than the RMS voltage for a sinusoidal signal.\nHistory of the volt.\nIn 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Volta developed the so-called Voltaic pile, a forerunner of the battery, which produced a steady electric current. Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and silver. In the 1880s, the International Electrical Congress, now the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), approved the volt for electromotive force. The volt was defined as the potential difference across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power."}

Their music sounded too modern for his taste.\nHe was born into a German-speaking family. His father was a music teacher.

He did not study music at university but he knew a lot about music and played the piano very well. He started writing music reviews (writing about concerts that had taken place). For many years he wrote reviews in a paper called \"Neue freie Presse\". He became professor of history and music at the University of Vienna and was an adjudicator at lots of music festivals. His most famous book was called \"Vom Musikalisch-Sch\u00f6nen\" (\"About Beauty in Music\").\nHanslick's tastes were conservative (he did not like new ideas). We remember him today for writing good things about Brahms and bad things about Wagner. A lot of musicians took sides on this matter. It is sometimes called: \"The War of the Romantics\". Musicians had long arguments in the music journals about which kind of music was better.\nAlthough in some ways he was narrow-minded he had a lot of influence on music. His books on music are very interesting showing great knowledge. He knew most of the great musicians of his day.\nWagner made a caricature of Hanslick in his opera \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\" in which the town clerk Beckmesser criticizes the young singer Walther who sings songs which break the traditional rules of composition."}

It was the start of World War II in Europe. The invasion took place from 1 September to 6 October 1939. The invasion of Poland caused Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September; they did little to affect the September Campaign. In the end, Poland lost. Germany and the Soviet Union divided the country according to a treaty signed years before the war.\nIt is often called the first time that blitzkrieg was tried on the battlefield, but similar methods had been used earlier. The German surprise attack was successful. It was very effective against the ineffective and demobilized Polish Army, whose tanks and airplanes were nearly out and mostly old. They were outflanked, outmaneuvered, and outnumbered in September 1939, and easily destroyed by the Blitzkrieg. The Poles, if well prepared, could have had two million soldiers in the fight.\nIn the first few days of the German invasion, the Poles proved to be more difficult than the Germans expected. In the Battle of Mokra on September 2nd, the Poles repulsed an attack by a German Panzer division forcing their retreat. The German air force, unlike their invasions of other countries, did not easily overcome the outnumbered Polish Air Force. However, due to their great superiority in numbers, they gained air superiority after 5 to 6 days.\nSurrounded by German territories north, west, and south of Poland, the Poles had little space for tactical retreat. The Germans reached Warsaw and attacked on September 7 but were repulsed. They had suffered heavy tank losses and so were forced to retreat. The Battle of Bzura, on September 9, was the largest attack by the Poles during the war. The Poles had great initial success by decimating 2 German divisions and taking 3500 German prisoners. Polish infantry fought well, but by September 19, overwhelming German reinforcements defeated the Poles.\nThe Poles realized the British and French were in a phoney war and had no intention of assisting Poland, and the Red Army invaded Poland from the east on September 17, the Polish high command ordered as many troops and equipment to the Romanian bridgehead to enter Romania with the intention to continue their resistance by moving as much of their army to France as possible. Most of the Polish Navy escaped to Britain. Polish cryptographers who had cracked the German Enigma (machine) went to France and then to Britain to continue their work.\nPolish politicians set up a government-in-exile in France and later escaped to Britain. In 1945, when the Allied armies invaded Germany, forcing their surrender, the Polish army was the fourth largest allied army."}

One reason the Finnish forces did better is because they had good winter clothes and they wore white coats which camouflaged them in the snow. As well, the Finnish soldiers moved around on skis, which made it easy for them to sneak up on the Soviet soldiers.

It has with one of the highest standards of living in the country. Its capital is Florian\u00f3polis, which partly lies on the Santa Catarina Island.\nSanta Catarina shares borders with the states of Rio Grande do Sul to the south and Paran\u00e1 to the north. It is bordered on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the west it borders the province of Misiones, Argentina.\nSanta Catarina is the most \"European\" state of Brazil. Most of the people that live there are descendants of Portuguese, German and Italian immigrants.\nIts largest city is Joinville.\nHistory.\nEuropean colonies began with the Spanish settlement of Santa Catarina island in 1542. The Portuguese took control in 1675. The captaincy of Santa Catarina was created in 1738. Large numbers of European immigrants, especially from Germany, began arriving in the early 19th century. Immigrants from Italy, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Japan and other parts of Europe later came. This led to many small, family held farms in the state.\nIn late March 2004, the state was hit by the first ever hurricane recorded in the South Atlantic. Because there is no naming system for such an event in Brazil, Brazilian meteorologists called it Catarina, after the state.\nEuropean settlement.\nSanta Catarina is one of the Brazilian states that shows the most signs of recent European colonization. Most of the population are descendants of European settlers.\nPortuguese.\nThe Portuguese started arriving in the 1750s. The came mainly from the Azores islands, and colonized the coast. In the late 18th century, half of Santa Catarina's population was Portuguese-born. These Portuguese created many important towns of the State, such as Florian\u00f3polis, the capital.\nGermans.\nGermans started arriving in 1828. They were peasants that came to Brazil to get their own lands. They did this since Germany had many people and many people had no lands to work. German immigration was very low, until the 1850s, when many Germans started arriving in Southern Brazil. To create more German colonization in Southern Brazil, the Brazilian government created many \"German colonies.\" Many of these German colonies became big towns, such as Blumenau and Joinville, the largest city in Santa Catarina.\nGermans had kept to themselves in these communities for decades. They did not have much contact with other people of Brazil. For generations they were able to speak German and keep their German traditions in Brazil. This changed in the 1930s, when Brazil declared war against Germany in 1942. The German immigrants learned Portuguese and followed a \"Brazilian way of life.\"\nNowadays, the German influence in the State of Santa Catarina is still very strong. Many towns still have many parts of the German culture. For example, Pomerode is a small town where 90% of the people are German-Brazilian. Most of the people speak German fluently. Another example is the Oktoberfest of Blumenau and many other towns in the region. The architecture and food also show German influence.\nItalians.\nItalian settlers started arriving in Santa Catarina in 1875. They came in large numbers until the 1910s. They were peasants from Northern Italy. They created Italian colonies close to the coast. In the beginning, the Italian settlement had failed. This was because many Italians died of tropical diseases or left the colonies to find better conditions. However, in southern Santa Catarina, they found cooler weather and better lands, and the colonies did very well. Many Italians worked in the coal industry."}

Some trails are off-limits to everyone other than hikers, and few trails allow motorized vehicles. \nNomenclature.\nIn the United States, the word footpath is also used to mean a trail; however in Australian English, New Zealand English, Indian English, and Irish English this word means \"sidewalk\" (American English) or \"pavement\" (British English).\nIn Australia, the word track can be used interchangeably with trail, and can refer to anything from a dirt road to a pedestrian walkway (generally also unpaved). The term \"trail\" gained popularity during World War II, when many servicemen from the United States were stationed in Australia, which probably influenced its being adopted by elements of the Australian media at the time (see Kokoda Track). In New Zealand, the word track is used almost exclusively except in reference to cross-country skiing, where trail is used.\nTrail types and use.\nWalking trails.\nTrail use has become very popular for a wide variety of users. Some trails are meant as nature trails, and are used by people learning about the natural world. Many trails are day trails, what means that they are generally used by people out for a short hike, less than a day. Some trails are backpacking trails, or long-distance trails, and are used by both day hikers and by backpackers. Some of the trails are over a thousand miles (1,500 km) long and may be hiked in sections by backpackers, or completed in one trip by dedicated hikers. Some trails are specifically used by other outdoor enthusiasts to gain access to another feature, such as good climbing sites. Many runners also favor running on trails rather than pavement, as giving a more vigorous work-out and better developing agility skills, as well as providing a more pleasant exercise environment. See trail running.\nStairway Trails.\nStairway is another way to ascend higher slopes. Stairway trails are usually for walking only. The stairs are constructed using cuts in dirt, rocks or concrete. Popular stairway trails include Stairway Trails in Bernal Heights East - San Francisco, Stairs at many hill top Hindu temple (Tirumala, Palani) used during Pilgrimage &amp; Machu Picchu.\nBicycle trails.\nRecent decades have seen an explosion of interest in cycling, both street-type and off-road type. A common term for these facilities is simply \"bike trail\". These trails may be built to a different set of standards than foot trails, requiring more stable, harder surfaces, less strenuous grades, longer sight visibility, and less sharp changes in direction. On the other hand, the cross-slope of a bike trail may be significantly greater than a foot trail, and the actual treadway may be narrower in some cases.\nEquestrian trails.\nHorseback riding has continued to be a popular activity for many trail users. Again, horse trails must be built to different standards than other trails. Sight distance is an important issue with horse trails, as is overhead and side clearance. While trail surface types are a relatively unimportant issue with hikers, they may be an important issue with horses. \nCross-country skiing.\nIn cross-country skiing, a trail (also called a 'track' or 'piste') refers to the parallel grooves cut into the snow, one for each ski.\nMotorized trails.\nMotorized trail use also remains very popular with some people. Such terms as \"ORV\", \"four-wheeling\", \"all-terrain vehicle\", and others actually have highly specific meanings. "}

He has piercing black eyes and his face was as smooth as he had just shaved. He had a thin and feeble voice yet he was hardly an old spiritual man.\nFailures.\nAlthough the Pardoner was a priest he lived a life that was far from the word of Jesus Christ. He often broke many of the seven deadly sins including greed, gluttony, and pride. He earned a living through preaching and selling fake relics to his supporters. He lies to people and promises them salvation and prosperity for a price. He has even taken money from a poor widow with starving children in order buy himself more luxuries.\nThe tale describes him getting money from the crowd as he cared more about money than a holy life.\nThe Tale Begins.\nThe host asks the Pardoner to tell a happy story after the sad tale that the Franklin told. The other people object to this and hope that he will tell a tale that is rich in morals. \nThe tale.\nHe starts his tale by talking about three young men who, like him, do sinful things like drink alcohol and sleep with young women. The Pardoner goes on to talk about the sins of the men in detail especially gambling, drunkenness, and gluttony. These three young men are rioters from the town of Flanders. \nOne night the three drunken men were at a tavern when they saw a corpse being carried to a grave. They ask who had died and find out it is one of their friends who has been killed by a murderous thief named \"Death\". The three men plan to avenge their friend's death and kill Death themselves. \nOn their way to find Death they see an old man that says Death will not take him even in his old age and suffering. The man says that he had left Death under an oak tree and that he was sure to still be there. They run to the tree and instead of seeing Death, they see lots of gold under the tree. They want to bring the gold back under the cover of night so that nobody will think they have stolen it. They sat down and sent the youngest to fetch 3 pies and 3 bottles of wine.\nThe remaining two come up with a plan to kill the third when he comes back so that the money could be split between only the two of them. At the same time the third man has the same thoughts as the other two and wants to have all of the money for himself. So he went and bought poison and poured it between the two bottles making sure he kept an un-poisoned bottle for himself. When he got back the other two men jumped out and killed the third man. But in celebration they decide to drink the wine unknowing that the poison was still in the wine, the choked to death due to the poison.\nSo in the end the moral to this story is that, the gold was the Death that the old man said was beneath the tree and due to their greed and gluttony they all died with nothing.\nMoral.\nThe love of money is the root of all evil, but also the divide between right and wrong.\nIrony.\nThe irony in this story has to do with the person telling it. The pardoner himself is a greedy man, but he goes on saying that greed is the root of all evil."}

Princess Ashe of Dalmasca and Prince Rasler of Nabradia had been married for a short time when the Archadian Empire invaded Dalmasca. A war started thereafter, and Archadia took over Dalmasca in no time, for the small country of Dalmasca stood no chance against the massive Archadian Empire. While the war was going on, Prince Rasler died, leaving Princess Ashe alone. The king of Dalmasca, Ashe's father, decided to surrender to Archadia, clinging to dreams of peace. However, Archadia's ruler wanted him dead as soon as the treaty was signed. Knights from Dalmasca tried to rescue him, but one of the captain of the knights, Basch, was replaced by his twin brother, who then killed king Raminas of Dalmasca, and the main character's older brother Reks. Basch's twin brother is a \"Judge\" who works for Archadia. The real Basch is accused of high treason and is supposedly killed. Princess Ashe went into hiding afterwards, and was deemed dead.\nTwo years later, Vaan, Reks' little brother, sneaks into the royal palace. When he was sneaking in, there was a banquet going on to celebrate the election of a new Consul, Vayne. Vaan meets the sky pirates Balthier and Fran in the palace as they were trying to steal the same thing he himself had taken. When Resistance forces broke into the palace, Vaan and his new friends had to hide in the waterways beneath the palace. While they were in the sewers, they met the leader of the Resistance, named Amalia. \nThis led to Vaan, Balthier and Fran getting put into the Nalbina Dungeons. What became of Amalia is yet unknown.\nIn the dungeons, Vaan, Balthier and Fran, find Basch. The Captain deemed a traitor by the people. They free Basch from the cage he is being held in and they go away from the Nalbina Dungeons to the Barheim Passage far below. There in the Barheim Passage, they fight creatures that can imitate treasure chests called Mimics, and they battle a Mimic Queen. After, the wall collapses, and Balthier, Vaan, Fran and Basch go back into the city of Rabanastre, which is the capital of Dalmasca. There, they learn that Vaan's friend Penelo was kidnapped by a head-hunter who was looking for Balthier. The kidnapper is named Ba'Gamnan, and he has taken Penelo to Bhujerba, a city in the sky. Balthier lets Vaan use his airship, which is like an airplane except different in shape, and they fly to Bhujerba to rescue Penelo\nWhen they get to Bhujerba, they go to the Lhusu Mines. The Lhusu Mines have a lot of magicite, but also have a lot of dangerous monsters. They go inside with a person who calls himself Lamont, and when they get to the end they see Ba'Gamnan. He chases them but does not reach them and they manage to get away safely."}

Hideki tries to get into a university by moving from his farm and studying at Seki, a cram school in Tokyo. He is not used to women, but likes to imagine that he is. He wants to have a girlfriend and a 'Persocom'. A Persocom is a kind of robot that looks like a person, but can be used like a computer, phone, and a \"partner\" in some cases. \nOne evening when Hideki is walking home from the grocery store, he finds a unique Persocom on a curb. It is a beautiful young girl with long blonde hair, wrapped in white cloth, lying against a pile of trash bags. He takes the Persocom home. Hideki looks all over the Persocom's body for a switch to turn her on, and finds it between her legs. He turns her on and asks her questions, but all she can say is \"chi\", so Hideki names her Chi .\nAnime.\nThe anime has 26 episodes and was broadcast across East Asia and Southeast Asia by the anime television network, Animax. Episodes 9, 18, and an extra 27th OVA episode are used as \"recap\" episodes, looking back on the events that happened previously. The episodes were given different numbers for the DVD release because the original recap episodes were not included as part of the main anime, instead being published together on the final DVD and re-numbered as 8.5, 16.5 and 24.5 making the series only 24 episodes.\nThere is a 6-minute special episode: \"Sumomo and Kotoko on a Quest\", or \"Chibits\", which is about Sumomo and Kotoko.\nThe series was supervised by Morio Asaka, and Hisashi Abe was the character designer and the animation director. The ending to the anime series is different from the manga. One thing that is different is that there is no allusion to Hideki never having Chi because of where her switch is, and the new part of Freya taking over Chi's body and asking her mother Chitose to shut them down, saying the Chobits series is a failure, and the activation of the program after all, although the effect on Persocons is not the same as in the manga."}

He is especially famous for his nine symphonies. They are all very long and are written in a late Romantic style for a large orchestra. He was also an organist and teacher.\nLife.\nBruckner\u2019s father was an organist and schoolmaster in a small village in Austria. By the age of four Bruckner was showing musical talent. He played hymn tunes on a tiny violin and then found the chords to go with them on the family spinet. When he was ten he sometimes played the village organ for services. After his father\u2019s death in 1837 he became a choirboy at the monastery school of St Florian where, in 1848, he became the organist of the abbey church. He started composing at this time and wrote a \"Requiem in d minor\". He liked the music of Schubert and Mendelssohn and they influenced the way he composed.\nAlthough he was happy at St Florian his friends told him he ought to look for a better job. They made him apply for the job of organist at the cathedral of Linz which he got easily. Meanwhile, he was trying to learn more about harmony and took a course with a famous teacher Simon Sechter. He then took a course in orchestration with the teacher Otto Kitzler. He became very interested in the music of Romantic composers like Liszt, Berlioz and especially Wagner. In 1864 he wrote a \"Mass\" in d minor for chorus and orchestra which clearly showed Wagner\u2019s influence. In 1866 he finished the first of his nine symphonies. He also wrote some very beautiful motets which are among the best music of the 19th century written for the Roman Catholic church.\nIn 1866 he spent three months in a sanatorium after a nervous collapse. During his later years he often suffered from depression.\nIn 1868 he became professor at the Vienna Conservatoire where he taught harmony and counterpoint. This was an excellent job. The last 25 years of his life he spent his time teaching and composing his symphonies. He also travelled and gave organ recitals at Notre Dame in Paris and the Royal Albert Hall and Crystal Palace in London. \nHis music was very modern for its time and some people, including the famous music critic Eduard Hanslick, did not like it. Hanslick said that Bruckner composed like Wagner, but although Bruckner had learned from Wagner he did not simply copy him. Bruckner\u2019s music shows his own strong personality. Hanslick, who preferred the symphonies of Brahms, did Bruckner a lot of harm by writing bad reviews of his music. He was Dean of the Music Department at the university in Vienna and did not want Bruckner to be appointed lecturer at the University. However, Bruckner did get that job in 1875. He became more and more famous, especially after the great conductor Arthur Nikisch conducted the first performance of his \"Symphony no 7\" in the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1884. He was given many honours. At the time of his death he had not yet finished his \"Symphony no 9\". He was buried in St Florian.\nPersonality.\nBruckner always remained a simple person who dressed and behaved like someone from a small village. He never felt very self-confident and was always asking other people whether he was good enough for his job. He never married or had a proper relationship with anyone although he fell in love with several young women.\nMusic and achievement.\nBruckner\u2019s symphonies show a wonderful ability to develop ideas slowly over a long period of time. Some of the slow movements last about 30 minutes. His music builds up in stages to big climaxes in a similar way to organ music. His scherzos (third movements) are tuneful dance movements which often sound like country dances. His music shows great harmonic and polyphonic skills. Bruckner often made revisions (changes) to his music. This often makes a problem for conductors today as they have to decide which version to use. Many musicians think that often Bruckner\u2019s first versions were the best. The revisions were often cuts to make a symphony shorter so that orchestras would be more likely to play it, but the cuts spoil the flow of the music. Nowadays we recognize Bruckner as one of the greatest writers of symphonies as well as a great composer of choral music."}

If we give the main theme a label \"A\" and the other musical ideas \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" etc. then the form of a rondo can be described as ABACADA. The sections in between the main \"A\" section are called \"episodes\". Rondos can vary in length, e.g. a rondo might be ABACADAEAFA. Each episode is normally in a different key from the main key.\nThe word \"rondo\" is sometimes given the French spelling: rondeau.\nComposers from the Baroque period onwards often write movements which are in rondo form. In the Classical music period the last movement of a symphony or sonata is very often a rondo. Rondos are normally fast and lively. They are a good way of finishing a long piece of music with something that is happy.\nThe word \"rondo\" is related to the word \"ritornello\" meaning: something that keeps returning.\nRondo form is sometimes combined with sonata form to make something which is called \"sonata rondo form\". In sonata rondo form the second tune is treated like the second subject in sonata form where it comes back in the main key the second time."}

In some cases an engineer may have to destroy something that he has built before. This may be to stop the enemy soldiers following them across the river for example. In many armies the military engineers are also called pioneers or sappers.\nToday a military engineer that operates during battle is called a combat engineer.\nPerhaps the first people who had a special force of military engineering specialists were the Roman army. Roman military engineering was very good in its time.

They are often called vocal runs or simply runs. Music which uses melismas can be called melismatic.\nIn Western music melismas are often used in operas or any other music which is written for the singer to show off the voice. Melismatic music is the opposite of music where each syllable has its own note. In the \"Alleluia Chorus\" from Handel's \"Messiah\" each syllable of the word \"Alleluya\" has its own note. But in other parts of the \"Messiah\" there are often melismas, e.g. in \"Thus saith the Lord\" the word \"shake\" (\"and I will shake the heavens and the earth\") is set to a run of 25 fast notes. This example can also be described as \"word painting\". Handel uses the melisma to make it sound like someone shaking something.\nMelismas are used a lot in music from many different cultures."}

The advantage of a spinet was that it was cheaper than a harpsichord and it also took up less room.\nSometimes the word used to be spelt differently, e.g. \"spinnet\" or \"spinnit\".\nThe spinet is different from a harpsichord because of the angle of the strings which run at an angle to the right. The whole instrument is a bit like a triangle in shape. The strings are arranged in pairs and the jacks (the quills which pluck the strings) are also in pairs in the wider gaps, plucking the string next to them.\nHarpsichords may have several sounds (in the same way that an organ has several stops making different sounds. This is not possible on a spinet, which has one sound only. It is always an 8-foot sound (the notes sound at the normal pitch, never an octave higher). Spinets were useful for accompanying."}

They were Metro Pictures, Samuel Goldwyn Productions, and Louis B. Mayer Productions.\nFrom the 1920s through World War II, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was the largest movie studio in Hollywood. They made more money than any other studio. At its busiest, MGM made about one movie a week and also made many short movies and cartoons. By the mid-1930s MGM had 4,000 employees. It had 23 Sound stages on their 117-acre lot. In 1939 MGM's assets were worth $144 million USD. In the 1940s the studio had problems. Movie theatre attendance was declining and television was starting to draw people away from the movies. In 1948, the Supreme Court decision United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. put an end to movie studios owning their own theatres. Lowes continued to be the parent company of MGM. But in 1954 Lowes Theatres was formed to control most of the movie theatres. In the late 1960s and 1970s, MGM sold off most of their back lot. They sold MGM's British studios and MGM Records.\nMGM/UA Entertainment.\nIn 1981 MGM's major stockholder, Kirk Kerkorian bought United Artists. In 1983 MGM and United Artists merged as MGM/UA Entertainment. On August 7, 1985, Turner Broadcasting System announced that they would buy MGM/UA. Turner saw the value of acquiring pre-May 1986 MGM's film library for his superstation WTBS. Under the terms of the deal, Turner would immediately sell MGM's United Artists back to Kerkorian. As a result of the MGM split from Turner, both MGM and UA became merely brands of MGM/UA Communications Co. in late 1986.\nMGM/UA Communications.\nIn late 1986 after Turner Broadcasting System split into two companies; Turner Broadcasting System and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Turner continued to release the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library on video known as Turner Home Entertainment. Turner sold the MGM lot for $190 million to Lorimar-Telepictures.\nMGM-Path\u00e9 Communications.\nIn 1990, Giancarlo Parretti, the owner of The Cannon Group, bought MGM/UA for $1.2 billion. He then merged Cannon with MGM and named it MGM-Path\u00e9 Communications. In 1991 there were a number of lawsuits and he defaulted to Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, his financial backer. Parretti also faced securities fraud charges in the United States and Europe. The company name was changed back to Metro-Goldwin-Mayer Inc. US bankruptcy laws forced Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais to sell MGM. It was acquired again by Kerkorian for $1.3 billion.\nNotable movies.\n\"The Wizard of Oz\" is one of the most famous movies made by MGM. It was made in 1939.

In 1825, he continued studies at Harvard Divinity School to be a minister. By 1829, he was the head of a church in Boston. Then some events happened that made him change the direction of his life.\nIn 1831, his wife died. Soon after that, Emerson left America to go on a journey through Europe. He returned after almost a year, then married again in 1833. Emerson didn\u2019t want to continue to be the head of a church. Instead, he began speaking in halls and schools. He began writing his thoughts in short writings and speeches. His first essay was \u201cNature.\u201d It would become one of his most popular essays. Then, many scholars know about him after he gave a speech at Harvard Divinity School in 1837. Emerson became an author instead of a head of a town church by creating his own, instead of following someone else's, plan for his life.\nEffects on his writings.\nEmerson\u2019s days as a child, when he was the son of a head of a town church, shaped his religious views. He also formed his way of thinking about spiritual topics from his education at Harvard. These views are present in his philosophy of Transcendentalism, a way of thinking about the connections between man, nature, and the highest being. Church leaders of Emerson\u2019s time focused on religious topics. Emerson instead focused on the everyday lives of people. Even though his father died when he was eight, and his first wife died a few years after marriage, Emerson wrote in a good way about his subjects. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, an author who lived during the same time as Emerson, also affected him.\nHis effect on American society.\nEmerson had several effects on Americans during his time. The first effect he had was on the value of the individual. He once wrote, \u201cLet us unfetter ourselves of our historical associations and find a pure standard in the idea of man.\u201d Up to this time, Americans still looked to England and other European countries for ideas on fashion and ways of thinking. Emerson\u2019s writings gave impulse to Americans to be free of European ideas on what is right or good. Along with individualism, Emerson is best known for starting the Transcendentalist movement. This philosophy made important the ideas of self-discovery and the connections between nature, all persons as a group, and the highest being.\nEnd of life.\nIn his later life, Emerson was a close friend of many other important authors and thinkers, including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Stuart Mill, and Thomas Carlyle. He traveled the world, including France, England, Italy and the Middle East. Emerson was active in writing and speaking into the 1870s. However, he started to forget things. He would only read from detailed notes or scripts. By 1879, his memory was so bad that he stopped making public appearances and speeches. He still socialized at private events, but never with the amount of talking that he once did. Walt Whitman described him at a party in 1881 to be a careful listener but he didn\u2019t join in any conversations. Within six months, in early 1882, Emerson died of pneumonia in Concord, Massachusetts."}

Bushrangers often stole expensive things from banks or coaches. There were more than 2000 bushrangers during Australia's past. Most were simply criminals and thieves. A few bushrangers became famous and were seen as heroes. They are part of a long history that has men such as Robin Hood and Dick Turpin in England, or Jesse James and Billy the Kid in the US.\nHistory.\nThe word \"bushranger\" was first used in Australia in 1805. It described three men who had stopped a cart near Sydney. Then, the word was used for criminals who attacked people on the roads or in the bush (the Australian countryside away from towns).\nThe first bushrangers were escaped convicts. One of the last bushrangers was Ned Kelly who was captured in 1880.\n1788 to 1840s: Criminals who escaped.\nCriminals who escaped stole things from farms far away and people walking on the roads. Sometimes they sold the stolen things to other free settlers.\nJohn \"Black\" Caesar was the first bushranger. He ran away from Sydney Cove many times before he was shot dead in 1796.\nBold Jack Donahue appeared in newspapers around 1827 for bushranging on the road between Sydney and Windsor. In the 1830s he was seen as the worst bushranger in the colony. Leading a gang of escaped criminals, Donahue became an important person in Australian folklore as the Wild Colonial Boy.\nBushranging happened all over Australia, but Van Diemen's Land (later known as Tasmania) produced the most violent and serious bushrangers. Hundreds of criminals were at large in the bush, farms were given up, and the army was brought in to try and capture the bushrangers. Indigenous Australian bushranger Musquito led attacks on settlers.\n1850s: gold rush era.\nThe bushrangers were busiest during the Gold Rush years of the 1850s and 1860s. Gold can be easily carried and also it can easily be turned into cash. The goldfields were in remote places and there were not very many police to guard the gold.\nGeorge Melville was killed by hanging in front of many people for stealing from the McIvor gold escort near Castlemaine in 1853.\n1860s to 1870s.\nBushranging numbers grew in New South Wales with the rise of the colonial-born sons of poor, often ex-convict farmers, who wanted a more exciting life than mining or farming.\nMuch of the bushranging in these years was in the Lachlan Valley, around Forbes, Yass and Cowra.\nFrank Gardiner, John Gilbert and Ben Hall led the most notorious gangs of the period. Other active bushrangers included Dan Morgan, based around the Murray River, and Captain Thunderbolt, killed outside Uralla, New South Wales.\n1880s to 1900s.\nThe increasing push of settlement, increased police efficiency, better rail transport and communications, such as telegraphy, made it increasingly difficult for bushrangers to evade capture.\nAmong the last bushrangers was the Kelly Gang led by Ned Kelly, who were captured at Glenrowan, Victoria in 1880, two years after they were outlawed.\nIn 1900 the Governor Brothers scared many people in the north of New South Wales.\nPublic perception.\nIn Australia, bushrangers often attract public sympathy.\nEntertainment.\nIn the same way that outlaws feature in many movies of the American western genre, bushrangers regularly feature in Australian literature, movie, music and television. These include:\nFamous bushrangers.\nSome bushrangers became famous as a result of their activities. They include:"}

The word is mainly used in Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Canada, and Alaska. \nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the phrase, \"the bush\", has a special symbolic meaning in Australian life. When used to describe the land, \"the bush\" means a wooded area, but not dense forest. It is usually dry and nitrogen-poor soil, mostly grassless, with thin to thick woody shrubs and bushes, with some eucalypt trees.\nWhen talking about people, \"the bush\" means any unpopulated areas outside of the major metropolitan areas. This can include mining and farming areas. It is not unusual to have a mining town in the desert, such as Port Hedland, Western Australia (Pop. 14,000) called \"the bush\" in the media.\nThe word bush is also added to any number of other words, things or activities to describe their rural, country or folk nature, e.g. \"Bush Cricket\", \"Bush Music\", etc."}
{"id": "53594", "revid": "1070632", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53594", "title": "Moondyne Joe", "text": "Moondyne Joe (1826 \u2013 1900), real name Joseph Bolitho Johns, is the most famous bushranger from Western Australia. He became famous, not for his crimes, but for his many escapes from gaol (jail).\nEarly years.\nJohns was born in Cornwall, England around 1826. His father Thomas Johns was a blacksmith. He might have had smallpox in his youth, as later his face is said to be \"pockmarked\". After his father died, Johns and his three brothers worked in the copper mines. In 1841 the family was living at Illogan, Penwith, Cornwall. By 1848 Johns had moved to Wales, working as an iron ore miner, at the Clydach Iron Works.\nCrimes.\nOn 15 November 1848, Johns and a friend, John Williams, were arrested near Chepstow for stealing from the house of Richard Price, three loaves of bread, one piece of bacon, several cheeses, and \"other goods\".&lt;ref name=\"The Welshman 30/03/1849\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with burglary and stealing, but they said they did not steal anything. On 23 March they were tried in court with Sir William Erleas the judge. Newspaper reports say that the men were very determined to prove their innocence, but Johns was not polite and did not follow the normal court rules. The men were convicted and sent to gaol for ten years. Johns must have made the judge angry. In other cases before the same judge that day, people on the same type of charges were sent to gaol for times between three weeks to three months.\nJohns and Williams spent the next seven months working on a government work party in the local area, before being sent to Millbank Prison. On 1 January 1850, they were sent to Pentonville Prison to serve six months of solitary confinement. On 21 October 1851, they were sent to Dartmoor Prison. Johns was sent to the Woolwich prison hulk \"Justitia\", probably for bad behavior. When the \"Justitia\" was destroyed by fire, he was moved to the \"Defence\". About a year later, he was put on convict transport ship, the \"Pyrenees\", and sent to the British penal colony of Western Australia.\nWestern Australia.\nThe \"Pyrenees\" sailed for Western Australia on 2 February 1853, and arrived in Fremantle on 30 April. He was a well behaved prisoner, and as a reward Johns was given a ticket of leave. On 10 March 1855, he was given a conditional pardon. He moved to the Avon Valley, which was a remote valley, in the Darling Range. The Aboriginal name for the area was \"Moondyne\". Johns put a fence around a natural water spring in the area, and trapped lost sheep, cattle and horses when they came to drink. Farmers would pay a reward to get their animals back.\nIn August 1861, Johns trapped a horse without a brand (owner's mark). He put his own brand on it, which was really stealing. He was soon arrested by the police. The horse was taken as evidence, and Johns was placed in the Toodyay gaol. During the night, Johns escaped from his cell, took the horse and the magistrate's new saddle and bridle. He was caught the next day, but he had killed the horse and cut out the brand to destroy the evidence. Without the proof he was only sent to gaol for three years for escaping, not the ten years he would have been given for horse stealing.\nMoondyne.\nJohns was a well behaved prisoner, so he was let out early with a ticket of leave in February 1864. He worked on a farm at Kelmscott. In January 1865 a bullock was killed and eaten, and the police said that Johns had done it. He said he had not killed the animal, but in court he was sent to gaol for ten years. At this time the only things he owned were one pair of trousers, one shirt, one pair of boots, one strap and one old hat. Johns decided he would not stay in gaol because he had not done anything wrong. In November he and another prisoner escaped from a work party. During the next month they robbed a few houses. Johns began calling himself \"Moondyne Joe\". They were captured east of York by the police with help from a black tracker, Tommy Windich. Black trackers were Indigenous Australian who had very good skills for finding things in the bush. For escaping, and for having a gun, Moondyne Joe was sent to prison for 12 months. He had to wear iron chains around his legs.\nEscapes from gaol.\nMoondyne Joe did not think he had been treated properly. In April 1865, he wrote a letter to the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice cut his gaol time by four years, but Joe was still not happy. A few weeks later he tried to cut the lock out of his door. He was given another six months in leg irons. In August, he escaped again, cutting off his leg irons. He met up with three other escaped convicts and together they robbed people in the bush around Perth. At the end of August, one of the gang was taken prisoner by the police.\nMoondyne Joe came up with a plan to get away from Western Australia by going overland to South Australia. This would be a long and difficult journey through the desert. On 5 September, Moondyne Joe stole boots, blankets, clothing, guns and ammunition, knives and food from a shop at Toodyay, owned by an old convict, James Everett. The gang went east, following the track made by the explorer Charles Hunt. Their tracks were discovered by police on 26 September, about east of York. The police set out after them, and they were captured on 29 September, about north east of Perth. This is near where the town of Westonia is now.\nBack to prison.\nMoondyne Joe was sent back to jail, and given another five years with hard labor. To make sure that he could not escape again, he was sent to Fremantle Prison where a special cell was built. It was made with stone, and lined with very thick pieces of wood. He was set to work in the prison yard breaking up rocks into small stones. He was watched all the time by a prison guard. The Governor of Western Australia, John Hampton, said to Johns: \"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\".\nHowever, the rocks broken up by Joe were not taken away, and soon a large amount of stones blocked the guard's view of Joe's legs. Partly hidden behind the stones, he sometimes hit his hammer against the prison wall. On 7 March, 1867, Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. The police searched everywhere, but he could not be found. He did not rob any more people, and he did not go any place where someone might know who he was. Many prisoners heard about Moondyne Joe's escape, and tried to escape themselves.\nIn March 1867, Moondyne Joe tried to steal some wine from the cellars at Houghton Winery. The owner had been helping the police on another search, and brought the policemen to the winery for a drink. Joe thought he had been seen, and ran out of the cellar, right into the policemen. He was sent back to prison and given four more years, as well as having to wear chains around his legs. He tried to escape, but was quickly captured. The new Governor, Weld, heard about Hampton's promise, and said the extra punishment was not fair. Moondyne Joe was given another ticket of leave in April 1871.\nLast years.\nMoondyne Joe did not rob anyone else, though he did do some wrong things and was sent back to jail a few more times. In January 1879, he married a widow named Louisa Hearn, and they spent some time looking for gold near Southern Cross. In 1881, while looking around Karridale, he discovered Moondyne Cave. In his later years, he began acting strangely, and became mentally ill. He died of senile dementia in the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum (now the Fremantle Arts Centre building) on 13 August, 1900. He was buried in Fremantle Cemetery.\nMoondyne Festival.\nEvery year, on the first Sunday of May, the small town of Toodyay remembers the life of Moondyne Joe with the Moondyne Festival. This festival takes place in the main street with street theatre, markets and performances. The most recent Moondyne Festival was on Sunday May 1, 2016.\nBooks, movies, music and art.\nWhile Moondyne Joe was bushranging in 1869, an Irish prisoner named John Boyle O'Reilly was in Fremantle Prison. He must have heard many stories about Joe's escapes. In September 1869, O'Reilly escaped with help from an American ship. After he got to the United States, he wrote a novel about convict life called Moondyne: An Australian Tale, whose main character was called \"Moondyne Joe\". The book is not a true story, and the character and the story are different to the life of Joseph Johns.\nIn 1913, O'Reilly's book was made into a movie called \"Moondyne\". Directed by W. J. Lincoln, it starred George Bryant, Godfrey Cass and Roy Redgrave.\nRandolph Stow wrote a funny children's book, \"Midnite: The Story of a Wild Colonial Boy\", in 1967. This told the story of an Australian bushranger based on the lives of Moondyne Joe and a Queensland bushranger, Captain Starlight.\nIn 2002, Cygnet Books published \"The Legend of Moondyne Joe\", by Mark Greenwood and pictures by Fran\u00e9 Lessac. The book won the award in the Children's Books section at the 2002 Western Australian Premier's Book Awards.\nThe Ballad of Moondyne Joe, a song which started:\n\"In the Darling Ranges, many years ago,&lt;br&gt;\nThere lived a daring outlaw, by the name of \u2018Moondyne Joe\u2019...\".\nAnonymous \nsung at the time of his 1867 escape:\nThe Governor's son has got the pip,&lt;br&gt; \nThe Governor's got the measles. &lt;br&gt; \nFor Moondyne Joe has give 'em the slip, &lt;br&gt; \nPop goes the weasel. \"\nAnonymous\n\"It were Moondyne of course&lt;br&gt;\nThat took Ferguson's horse...&lt;br&gt; \""}

{"id": "53612", "revid": "1023273", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53612", "title": "Standard deviation", "text": "Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean or expected value). A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the average, while a high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out.\nThe reported margin of error is usually twice the standard deviation. Scientists commonly report the standard deviation of numbers from the average number in experiments. They often decide that only differences bigger than two or three times the standard deviation are important. Standard deviation is also useful in money, where the standard deviation on interest earned shows how different one person\u2019s interest earned might be from the average.\nMany times, only a sample, or part of a group can be measured. Then a number close to the standard deviation for the whole group can be found by a slightly different equation called the sample standard deviation, explained below. In which case, the standard deviation of the whole group is represented by the Greek letter formula_1, and that of the sample by formula_2.\nBasic example.\nConsider a group having the following eight numbers:\nThese eight numbers have the average (mean) of 5:\nTo calculate the population standard deviation, first find the difference of each number in the list from the mean. Then square the result of each difference:\nNext, find the average of these values (sum divided by the number of numbers). Last, take the square root:\nThe answer is the population standard deviation. The formula is only true if the eight numbers we started with are the whole group. If they are only a part of the group picked at random, then we can obtain an unbiased \"estimate\" of what the population standard deviation is by dividing by instead of in the bottom (denominator) of the formula above. Then the answer is the (bias-corrected) sample standard deviation. This is called the Bessel's Correction. We often use this correction because the sample variance, i.e., the square of the sample standard deviation, is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, in other words, the expected value or long-run average of the sample variance equals the population (true) variance. However, it is not the case that the sample standard deviation is an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation. Although Bessel's correction is an unbiased estimate of the variance, this estimate does have a higher mean square error than the biased estimate, or in other words, the biased estimate (that is, dividing by \"n\" rather than \"n-1\") is on average closer to the true value.\nMore examples.\nHere is a slightly harder, real-life example: The average height for grown men in the United States is 70\", with a standard deviation of 3\". A standard deviation of 3\u201d means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have a height 3\" taller to 3\u201d shorter than the average (67\"\u201373\") \u2014 one standard deviation. Almost all men (about 95%) have a height 6\u201d taller to 6\u201d shorter than the average (64\"\u201376\") \u2014 two standard deviations. Three standard deviations include all the numbers for 99.7% of the sample population being studied. This is true if the distribution is normal (bell-shaped).\nIf the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70\" tall. If the standard deviation were 20\", then some men would be much taller or much shorter than the average, with a typical range of about 50\"\u201390\". \nFor another example, each of the three groups {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has an average (mean) of 7. But their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1. The third group has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its numbers are all close to 7. In general, the standard deviation tells us how far from the average the rest of the numbers tend to be, and it will have the same units as the numbers themselves. If, for example, the group {0, 6, 8, 14} is the ages of a group of four brothers in years, the average is 7 years and the standard deviation is 5 years.\nStandard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty. In science, for example, the standard deviation of a group of repeated measurements helps scientists know how sure they are of the average number. When deciding whether measurements from an experiment agree with a prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is very important. If the average number from the experiments is too far away from the predicted number (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested may not be right. For more information, see prediction interval.\nApplication examples.\nUnderstanding the standard deviation of a set of values allows us to know how large a difference from the \"average\" (mean) is expected.\nWeather.\nAs a simple example, consider the average daily high temperatures for two cities, one inland and one near the ocean. It is helpful to understand that the range of daily high temperatures for cities near the ocean is smaller than for cities inland. These two cities may each have the same average daily high temperature. However, the standard deviation of the daily high temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city .\nSports.\nAnother way of seeing it is to consider sports teams. In any sport, there will be teams that are good at some things and not at others. The teams that are ranked highest will not show a lot of differences in abilities. They do well in most categories. The lower the standard deviation of their ability in each category, the more balanced and consistent they are. Teams with a higher standard deviation, however, will be less predictable. A team that is usually bad in most categories will have a low standard deviation. A team that is usually good in most categories will also have a low standard deviation. However, a team with a high standard deviation might be the type of team that scores many points (strong offense) but also lets the other team score many points (weak defense). \nTrying to know ahead of time which teams will win may include looking at the standard deviations of the various team \"statistics.\" Numbers that are different from expected can match strengths vs. weaknesses to show what reasons may be most important in knowing which team will win. \nIn racing, the time a driver takes to finish each lap around the track is measured. A driver with a low standard deviation of lap times is more consistent than a driver with a higher standard deviation. This information can be used to help understand how a driver can reduce the time to finish a lap.\nMoney.\nIn money, standard deviation may mean the risk that a price will go up or down (stocks, bonds, property, etc.). It can also mean the risk that a group of prices will go up or down (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is one reason to make decisions about what to buy. Risk is a number people can use to know how much money they may earn or lose. As risk gets larger, the return on an investment can be more than expected (the \"plus\" standard deviation). However, an investment can also lose more money than expected (the \"minus\" standard deviation). \nFor example, a person had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points (pp). Stock B over the past 20 years had an average return of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. Thinking about the risk, the person may decide that Stock A is the safer choice. Even though they may not make as much money, they probably will not lose much money either. The person may think that Stock B's 2 point higher average is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return).\nRules for normally distributed numbers.\nMost math equations for standard deviation assume that the numbers are normally distributed. This means that the numbers are spread out in a certain way on both sides of the average value. The normal distribution is also called a Gaussian distribution because it was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. It is often called the bell curve because the numbers spread out to make the shape of a bell on a graph. \nNumbers are not normally distributed if they are grouped on one side or the other side of the average value. Numbers can be spread out and still be normally distributed. The standard deviation tells how widely the numbers are spread out.\nRelationship between the average (mean) and standard deviation.\nThe average (mean) and the standard deviation of a set of data are usually written together. Then a person can understand what the average number is and how widely other numbers in the group are spread out. \nThe way a group of numbers is spread out can also be given by the coefficient of variation (CV), which is the standard deviation divided by the average. It is a dimensionless number. Coefficient of variation is often multiplied by 100% and written as a percentage.\nHistory.\nThe term \"standard deviation\" was first used in writing by Karl Pearson in 1894, after he used it in lectures. It was as a replacement for earlier names for the same idea: for example, Gauss used \"mean error\"."}

It is also said that deflation is a sign of a weak state of that country's economy, because deflation usually happens during an economic collapse. Deflation is thought to be even worse than inflation.\nDeflation starts when people are waiting for prices to go down even more. They will then spend less money. Because of that, companies can not afford to keep up the amount of goods that are made, and have to lower that amount, as well as fire workers to make even a small profit.\nEven if an economy is growing, there can be some amount of deflation - if the amount of money going around grows slower than the making of goods. There has not been much deflation in the world since the 1930s, except in Japan.\nDeflation can be helped by the country's own government by lowering the companies' tax levels, so they can lower their prices while getting the same profit. This way normal people are more encouraged to buy the cheap goods they were waiting for, and slowly the companies can make more profit. Governments do not like deflation, because it means that they can collect less tax."}

At this time a lot of exciting new movies were being made in the Soviet Union. There were also some very interesting new plays in the theatres. The famous theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold had many new ideas. However, operas that were being written then were mostly quite uninteresting.\nShostakovich, who was only just twenty years old, started to make Soviet operas interesting again. He took the story called \"The Nose\" which was written by Nikolai Gogol. It is about a man who wakes up one day to find his nose has gone.\nThe opera was first performed in 1930. Unfortunately by then the music critics had changed their ideas because of the political situation in the Soviet Union which was being ruled by the dictator Stalin. They wrote bad things about the opera and the performances soon had to stop. It was not until 1974 that it was performed again in the Soviet Union.\nThe opera is a satire. It pokes fun at bureaucrats: people in official jobs who think they are more important than they really are.\nThe story of the opera.\nIn the opera the barber Ivan Yakovlevich is seen shaving the Major. In the morning Ivan wakes up and his wife gives him some fresh bread and onion. When he cuts the bread open he finds a nose inside. His wife screams and yells at her husband. She chases him out of the house. He runs along the street with the nose, feeling very embarrassed. He throws the nose in the river, but a policeman catches him. He tries unsuccessfully to bribe him.\nIn the next scene the Major wakes up and finds he has no nose. He goes to tell the police. He goes to the cathedral and sees his nose who is dressed up as an important person (the nose is now a person, sung by a singer). The Major is not sure what to say to his nose because his nose is now more important than he is. He can\u2019t speak properly and the nose does not understand him. The nose speaks very confidently, like a person of high rank. The Major cannot find the Chief of Police so he goes to the newspaper office. The people there laugh at him and say that they cannot put a notice in the newspaper about a lost nose because it would make their newspaper look silly. He is told to see a doctor. When the Major takes his handkerchief away from his face to show that he really has lost his nose the newspaper staff become interested because they think they have a good story for the newspaper. They offer him some snuff. Of course, he cannot sniff it, and gets very cross.\nThe police, who are looking for the lost nose, are watching people who are getting into a coach. They think the nose might be trying to leave the city. As the coach leaves the nose runs in, tries to stop the coach, frightens thehorses, the driver tries to shoot the nose, and everyone starts to fight the nose, beating and hitting it until it is back to its normal size. The policeman wraps it in a piece of paper. He returns it to the Major and asks for payment. The Major tries to stick his nose back on his face but he can\u2019t. Even the doctor can\u2019t do it. The nose escapes into the crowd. The Major thinks that Madame Podtochina, who tried to make him marry her daughter, has used witchcraft on him. He writes to her asking her to stop the spell but she writes back thinking that he wants to marry her daughter. Large crowds appear on the street to try to see the nose.\nIn the last part of the opera the Major has got his nose back where it belongs. He is shaved by the barber and then walks along the street proudly showing everyone his nose.\nThe music.\nThe music is just right for telling a story which is a satire. The policeman, for example, sings in a high, squeaky voice. The music at the beginning sounds rather like circus music. At the end of the scene when he is unable to bribe the police officer there is music just for percussion instruments. This bit is very famous and often played as a separate piece. One of the barber\u2019s songs is accompanied by four balalaikas. Madame Podtochina\u2019s daughter sings like a romantic opera singer. The waltz which is sung as the people get on the coach is a parody waltz."}

Some developers make games for only one or two types of game systems, others might even make one kind of game. Some games are only for one system. Developers might try and make a copy of such a game to another, different system. Some translate games from one language to another.\nVideo game developers work in \"development companies\". There are over 1,000 development companies today. A big part of that thousand is very small companies, that usually only have one or two workers - these kind of small companies make games for the Internet or mobile phones. Some development companies are big, too. They have buildings in many places and hundreds of workers.\nTypes of developers.\nThere are three types of video game developers.\nThird-party developer.\nThird-party developers are video game developers that make deals with big publishers to make one game at a time. The developers are not part of the company: when the game is complete, the developers do not have to make another game for the publisher if they do not want to. Publishers will tell them exactly what they want third-party developers to do, and the developers do not have very much power to do something else.\nIn-house developers.\nIn-house developers work directly with the publisher. They have more freedom in the making of the game than third-party developers have. Sometimes publishers buy third-party developers, and so they become in-house developers: workers for the publisher. This is an easy way for the publisher because the developers are workers for the publisher and so the publisher has more control.\nIndependent developers.\nIndependent developers are usually small groups of people that are not owned by any publisher or another company. Because of that, most independent developers publish their games themselves. If they do that, the games usually will not get much attention or money. Still, independent developers can make exactly the game they want, when there is no publisher to tell them what to do. These are also sometimes called indie developers."}

There is also one legal thrust (\"tsuki\") on throat.\nThe \"men\" can only be struck from face, not from back. However, only one of the two hands can be struck, it depends on which kind of posture(\"kamae\") your opponent are using. A struck to the right side of body(one kind of \"do\") will often be ignored by referee because in the old days samurai will have a smaller sword in this position, which gives this position a good protection. Very important, because \"tsuki\" is somehow dangerous, junior practicer perform \"tsuki\" is forbidden both in match and daily training.\nIn a match, the attacker must name the location of each strike. Often, name these locations by Japanese list before(\"men\",\"kote\",\"do\",\"tsuki\"), but some people will name it by Korean or Chinese or other language, or even a meaningless shout. All these kinds of shout name \"kiai\". An effective attack must contains \"kiai\" besides other essential factors.\nEquipment.\nThe weapon used in kendo is a bamboo sword, called \"shinai\". The kendo armour, which the players must wear, is called \"bogu\" and is made of a helmet (\"men\"), breastplate (\"do\"), waist protector (\"tare\"), and special gloves (\"kote\").\nLesson contents.\nLesson is called \"keiko\" in kendo. keiko means that We think about past. kendo's keiko is distinguished between \"shinai keiko\" and \"kata keiko\". the building which we do kendo is called \"dojyo\".

The area has been designated as Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The highest point in the Cotswolds is Cleeve Hill at 330\u00a0m (1083\u00a0ft).\nThe Cotswolds lie within the current ceremonial counties of Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire. The county of Gloucestershire forms the largest area of the Cotswolds.\nDescription.\nThe spine of the Cotswolds runs southwest to northeast through six counties, particularly Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, and southern Warwickshire. The northern and western edges of the Cotswolds are marked by steep slopes down to the Severn valley and the River Avon, Avon. These are a result of the broken edge of the limestone layer. On the eastern boundary is the city of Oxford and on the west is Stroud. To the south towns as Cirencester, Lechlade, Tetbury, Beverston and Fairford mark the southern limit of this region. \nIn the Middle Ages, the wool trade made the Cotswolds prosperous. Some of this money was put into the building of churches. The area has a number of large, handsome Cotswold stone \"wool churches\". The area is still wealthy and has attracted people who own second homes in the area, or have chosen to retire to the Cotswolds.\nTypical Cotswold towns are Bourton-on-the-Water, Broadway, Burford, Chipping Norton, Cirencester, Moreton-in-Marsh, Stow-on-the-Wold and Winchcombe. The town of Chipping Campden is famous as the home of the Arts and Crafts movement, that was founded by William Morris at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.\nThe Cotswold Way is a long-distance footpath about 103\u00a0miles long (166\u00a0km) running the length of the AONB, mainly on the edge of the Cotswold escarpement with good views over the Severn Valley and the Vale of Evesham.\nCotswld stone.\nThe area has attractive small towns and villages built of \"Cotswold stone\" (a yellow limestone). This limestone is rich in fossils. The stone is a yellow oolitic Jurassic limestone. At the time, this was laid down in a warm tropical sea, about 177 million years ago. The latitude of Britain was about where North Africa is today. The stone is full of fossils such as stalked crinoids. A project is under way to collect examples for the Natural History Museum."}

It is in the northeastern part of the country. It is on the edge of the South American continent.\nGeography.\nRio Grande do Norte has a large coastline. The state is well known for its beaches and sand dunes. The air is the cleanest in South America. \nBecause of a large mountain chain called Serra da Borborema, Rio Grande do Norte has two main climates. The area along most of the coastline is very tropical. Inland, much of the state is very dry.\nThe dry climate is not only because by the low amount of rainfall but also because of the fact that it rarely rains at all. Often years go by with no or very little rain. Most of the interior of the state is part of the \"Polygon of Droughts\". This is an area which gets special attention from the federal government.\nRocas Atoll belongs to the state of Rio Grande do Norte. It is in the Atlantic Ocean, 260\u00a0km Northeast of Natal.\nHistory.\nThe first European to come to the region may have been the Spaniard Alonso de Ojeda in 1499. The northeastern tip of South America, cape S\u00e3o Roque, was first seen by European navigators in 1501. This was during a 1501-1502 Portuguese expedition led by Amerigo Vespucci. He named the spot after the saint of the day. The Vespucci expedition also named the Potengi river, \"Rio Grande\". The name is Portuguese for \"Great River\". The area and state were named after the river. For decades, no permanent European settlement was made in the area.\nIn the 16th century (between 1535 and 1598), the area was explored by French pirates. In 1598, the Portuguese built the \"Forte dos Reis Magos\". The next year, they created the city of Natal. \nIn 1633, the area was fought over between the Portuguese and the Dutch. In 1654, the Dutch were finally cast out.\nDuring World War II, Rio Grande do Norte was used as an Allied airbase. The base was used to German-occupied North Africa.\nIn 1964, Latin America's first space launch site was built in Rio Grande do Norte; \"Barreira do Inferno\" (Hell's Barrier). It is often called the \"Brazilian NASA\".\nEconomy.\nHistorically, the economy of Rio Grande do Norte has been based on sugar and cattle. In the 1980s, the state government has realised that tourism is a very good industry. Since then, more money is being used to build placed for tourists and repairing colonial buildings in major cities.\nFruit is also grown in Rio Grande do Norte. The state grows 70% of Brazil's melons. The state is famous for its mango and cashew fields. The world's largest cashew tree is there. It has a circumference of 500 metres and an area of 7,300m\u00b2. It is 70 times the size of average cashew trees.\nCities.\nNatal is the capital and largest city in the state. Other cities include:\nFlag.\nThe flag was adopted on December 3 1957. It is based on a design by Luis de Camara Cascudo. In the middle of the flag is the coat of arms of the state. The coat of arms was adopted on July 1 1909. It shows a sailing boat at the coast in the middle. This is for the fishing and salt industries. Above this is a bar which shows two flowers on the sides and two cotton bolls in the center. To the sides of the shield are a coconut palm to the right and a carnauba palm to the left.

The capital is a planned city. It had areas built for homes, business, schools and other uses. Originally built for up to one million people, the city now has many more than one million people.

He became emperor after defeating his younger half-brother Hu\u00e1scar in a civil war that followed the death of their father, Inca Huayna Capac, from an infectious disease (maybe malaria or smallpox). During the civil war, the Spaniard Francisco Pizarro arrived and captured Atahuallpa, and used him to control the Inca empire. Eventually, the Spanish executed Atahuallpa. So ended the Inca Empire (although several weak puppet successors followed him.) \nCivil war.\nOn the death of their father, the Emperor Huayna Capac, and their older brother, Ninan Cuyochi, who had been the heir, the empire was divided between the two surviving brothers, Hu\u00e1scar and Atahualpa. Huascar got the major part of it with the capital Cusco, and Atahualpa the northern parts, including Quito (now the capital of Ecuador). For a couple of years, the two brothers reigned without problems. But Huascar demanded that Atahuallpa swear an oath to him. Atahuallpa refused, and the civil war began. \nThe final battle took place at Quipaipan, where Huascar was captured. Atahuallpa was resting in the city of Cajamarca in the Andes with his army of 80,000 troops on his way to the south and Cusco to claim his throne. \nBy this time the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro had established the city of Piura, the first Spanish settlement in Peru on July of 1532. After two months on the march, Pizarro had arrived at Cajamarca with just 168 men under his command and sent Hernando de Soto, friar Vicente de Valverde and native interpreter Felipillo to speak with Atahuallpa about the Spanish presence. \nThe Spanish envoys returned to Pizarro, who prepared a surprise attack against Atahuallpa's army in what became the Battle of Cajamarca on November 16, 1532.\nAccording to Spanish law the Spanish officially declared war on the Inca people. When Atahuallpa coldly asked the priest Valverde by what authority he and his people could say such things, Valverde offered him a Bible, saying that the authority came from the words in it. He examined it and then asked why did it not speak to him. He then threw it to the ground. That gave the Spaniards the excuse they needed to wage war on the Incas. They opened fire, and over the course of 2 hours more than two thousand Inca soldiers were killed. The Spanish then imprisoned Atahuallpa in the Temple of the Sun. \nAtahuallpa still could not believe the Spanish intended to take control of his kingdom. He thought that if he gave them the gold and silver they sought they would leave. In exchange for his release, he agreed to fill a large room with gold and promised the Spanish twice that amount in silver. Although he was stunned by the offer, Pizarro had no intention of releasing the Inca because he needed the ruler's influence over the native people to maintain order in the surrounding country.\nBut then Pizarro decided to have him executed because he feared he could be freed by an Inca General. Pizarro staged a mock trial and found Atahuallpa guilty of revolting against the Spanish and murdering Hu\u00e1scar, his own brother. Atahuallpa was sentenced to execution by burning. He was horrified, since the Inca believed that the soul would not be able to go on to the afterlife if the body were burned. Friar Vicente de Valverde, who had earlier offered the Bible to Atahuallpa, intervened again, telling Atahuallpa that if he agreed to convert to Christianity he would convince the rest to commute the sentence. Atahualpa agreed to be baptized into the Christian faith. He was given the name Juan Santos Atahualpa and then was strangled with a garrote instead of being burned. Atahuallpa died on August 29, 1533.\nAtahuallpa was succeeded by his brother, the puppet Inca Tupac Huallpa, and later by another brother Manco Inca Yupanqui."}

It is the only comic opera that Wagner wrote. Wagner wrote the words (the libretto) in 1862 and composed the music in 1867. It was first performed in Munich in 1868.\nThe story is set in the town of Nuremberg (German: N\u00fcrnberg) in 16th century Germany. It is about a group of Mastersingers. The Mastersingers (German: Meistersinger) were a guild of singers in Germany many centuries ago. The most famous of them was a man called Hans Sachs, who lived in the 16th century. Although Hans Sachs was a real person, the story of the opera was made up by Wagner. It is a story about a song contest.\nThe story of the opera.\nThe prelude (orchestral introduction) to the opera is very famous and is often played by itself at concerts. It has several tunes which are sometimes cleverly played at the same time (counterpoint). These tunes are used during the opera and are associated with particular people or ideas (such tunes are called leitmotifs).\nAct One.\nThe young knight Walther is in church and sees a beautiful young girl, Eva. He wants to know whether she is married. She tells him that she will be married to the person who wins the singing contest the next day. Walther tries to learn the art of the Mastersingers from David, who works for Hans Sachs, the cobbler. David himself is in love with Magdalene. The apprentices start to prepare the stage for the contest.\nIf Walther is to win the contest he will have to compose his own mastersong and sing it. He will have to compose it according to a lot of strict rules (the number of lines, the rhyming patterns etc.). When he meets the other Mastersingers he introduces himself, saying that he learned the art of singing from the ancient poet Walther von der Vogelweide and from nature itself. He sings this in a song which is very beautiful, but it does not obey the rules of the Mastersingers. The Mastersingers are not able to understand the beauty of his song.\nOne of the Mastersingers is the town clerk. His name is Beckmesser. He is a comic figure and Wagner makes him look very silly. Beckmesser is the \u201cmarker\u201d. This means something like: an \u201cadjudicator\u201d. When a singer makes a \u201cmistake\u201d (disobeys the rules) the marker puts a chalkmark on the board. When Walther sings his song Beckmesser makes lots of chalkmarks. Hans Sachs is the only person who realizes the beauty of his song. There is a lot of shouting and Walther has to stand on a chair to finish his song.\nAct 2.\nA street in Nuremberg at night. Eva\u2019s grand house is opposite Hans Sachs\u2019 simple house. Eva\u2019s father realizes she is in love with Walther. Hans is thinking about the young knight and how well he sings. Eva asks Hans who he thinks will be likely to win the song contest. Then she is called back by her father. Beckmesser has come and would like to serenade her (sing her a love song). Walther meets up with Eva and they wonder whether they should elope (run away together). Eva changes clothes with her maid. Hans Sachs stops them as they are about to elope. Beckmesser is tuning his lute ready to sing. Walther would like to argue with him but Eva gets him to sit quietly while Beckmesser sings. Hans Sachs, who is mending Beckmesser\u2019s shoe, has other ideas: he sings a song himself, and this annoys Beckmesser who is trying to sing to the girl he thinks is Eva (but it is Eva\u2019s maid in disguise). He tells Hans to stop singing. Hans says that he will stop, but he will hammer on his shoe every time he hears Beckmesser make a mistake. Beckmesser starts singing again, and Hans hammers lots of times. All the neighbours wake up and come into the street and argue and fight. In the end the night watchman comes and everybody goes back into their houses.\nAct 3.\nDavid is preparing a song for the midsummer festival. Then Walther arrives and tells Hans that a song came to him in a dream. Hans helps him to prepare the song for the contest. When they have left the workshop Beckmesser comes in and sees the piece of paper with the song. He picks it up when Hans returns and says that it is obvious that he, Hans, wants to enter the contest. Hans tells Beckmesser that he can have the song. Beckmesser is delighted and thinks he can now win Eva in marriage.\nAt the song contest Beckmesser tries to sing the song, but he sings it to his own tune which does not fit the words, and he gets the words all muddled up. Everyone laughs and he leaves the stage angrily, saying that Sachs wrote the song. Walther now sings his prize song. This time people realize how beautiful it is although it does not obey the usual rules. Walther can marry Eva.\nThe music of the opera.\nWagner\u2019s operas have continuous music which develops is very logical ways using leitmotifs. In the prelude we hear several tunes which are leitmotifs that are to be important during the opera: a theme that represents the dignity of the mastersingers, a theme for passion which later becomes Walther\u2019s prize song, the chattering of the apprentices etc. The music at the beginning of Act Three is also often played separately in the concert hall.\nThere are many beautiful moments in the opera. Wagner cleverly changes the style to suit the action, for example when Eva\u2019s father is talking about the Mastersingers\u2019 reputation in Germany we hear an old-fashioned recitative. Beckmesser is made to look stupid through his music which contrasts with Walther\u2019s romantic music.\nInterpretations of the opera.\nPeople have explained the meanings behind this opera in several ways. The basic story is\nabout the wonderful German art of singing. It is also about the fact that composers should be able to write music which is beautiful without having to obey rules that were made up long ago and have become old-fashioned. Wagner was trying to bring lots of changes to opera, making the drama the most important thing. Some people found his new ideas quite difficult to follow, and this may be why he chose, for once, to write a comic opera instead of a serious one based on mythology. The character of Beckmesser is a caricature of Eduard Hanslick, a famous music critic who did not like the music of Wagner and Bruckner but preferred the more traditional music of Brahms and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.\nThe opera has been criticized because Wagner may have meant the story to have an anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) meaning. This is certainly the way that Hitler understood it. It was his favourite opera, and the idea of praising German art and song fitted in nicely with his racist views. The character of Beckmesser is also a caricature of a stereotype Jew."}
