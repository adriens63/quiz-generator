He served in the House from 1805-1809, in the 8th, 9th, and 10th Congresses. During the 10th Congress, he was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He was also one of the managers appointed in 1804 to conduct the impeachment hearings for John Pickering, judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, and later in the same year, the impeachment hearings against Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\nLife.\nBorn in Scotland, he immigrated to North Carolina in 1772 with his parents. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1794 and began studying law. He was admitted to the bar in North Carolina and began practicing in Knoxville, Tennessee. \nPolitical life.\nHe left Congress in 1809 to become judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court, serving until 1811.\nHe served as a United States Senator from Tennessee twice, once from 1811 to 1814, having been elected to fill the seat of Jenkin Whiteside, and again from 1815 to 1818. His first service was from October 8, 1811 to February 11, 1814, when he resigned to accept appointment as the United States Secretary of the Treasury. He returned to the Senate on October 10, 1815.

Congress had failed to recharter the First Bank of the United States after its charter expired in 1811, and appropriations for the war were unavailable, so Campbell had to convince Americans to buy government bonds. He was forced to meet to lenders terms, selling government bonds at exorbitant interest rates. In September, 1814 the British occupied Washington, D.C. and the credit of the government was lowered even further. Campbell was unsuccessful in his efforts to raise money through additional bond sales and he resigned that October after only eight months in office, disillusioned and in bad health.\nHe died in 1848 and is buried at Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.\nCampbell County, Tennessee, is named in his honor."}

It is an organic compound. Chloroform is one of the intermediate substances that occur in the production of Polytetrafluoroethylene, better known as \"Teflon\". Chloroform is used as a solvent. In the 19th century, it was a widely used anaesthetic.\nHistory.\nThe first who reported to have produced Chloroform was the French chemist Eug\u00e8ne Soubeiran, in 1831. Soubeiran took acetone and ethanol, and used bleach powder for the reaction. The American physician Samuel Guthrie prepared gallons of the material and described its \"deliciousness of flavor.\" Independently, Justus von Liebig also described it. Chloroform was named and chemically characterised in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas. Starting in the 1850s factories made large amounts. Its use as an anesthetic declined in the early 20th century as safer chemicals were more used.\nProduction.\nChloroform is produced by mixing methane and chlorine at a temperature of 400 to 500\u00b0C. In this reaction, the result is a mix of chloromethane, dichloromethane, trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane.\nThe four compounds get then separated with a distillation.\nIn laboratories, chloroform can be produced by mixing sodium hypochlorite and acetone together. This is an exothermic reaction, meaning it makes a lot of heat.\nUses.\nThe main uses of Chloroform are:\nProblems.\nChloroform was used as an anaesthetic during childbirth and surgery, from about 1847. It replaced ether which was used before. Chloroform is very poisonous, and can cause breathing problems, and problems with the heart. Death from chloroform can come from cardiac arrest. When Chloroform is stored for a longer time period, it can decay into Phosgene. Phosgene was a chemical weapon (poison gas) used during the First World War. Chloroform can cause birth defects and lead to miscarriages. It may cause cancer."}

This affects one's mental and physical health. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are two of the most well known eating disorders today. Eating disorders affect 5-7% of American women, and only a small percent of men are affected.\nEating disorders involve more than just food. Many people with eating disorders are very sad and feel alone. They get depressed and do not want to eat in front of other people. They might use food as a way to cope, or they might restrict their food intake as a means of control. They might eat a lot of food in a very short period of time. They might throw up their food because they feel guilty. They might eat very little because they want to lose weight, even if they are already dangerously underweight (weighing less than what it is considered healthy). Even if they are underweight, they might see themselves as very fat. Many people with eating disorders suffer physical complications, like malnutrition (not getting enough nutrients that the body needs to be healthy), or electrolyte imbalances (a change in the amount of elements such as sodium or potassium that causes problems in the body's ability to work properly). Eating disorders can cause death.\nOn 1 December 2013 the \"Daily Telegraph\" reported that the number of children under thirteen treated in hospital for eating disorders in the UK had tripled."}

There are only two outcomes; anything less than perfect is taken to be unacceptable. The belief holds that one can achieve perfection and should aim for it. A person who believes this is called a \"perfectionist\".\nAt first, some consider perfectionism as helpful. Perfectionism can lead people to achieve great things and give them motivation. However, it is considered to be a belief that is mostly unhealthy and harmful. Perfectionism makes people set goals that are unrealistic and cannot be reached. This leads to many problems like depression, anxiety, eating disorders and low self-esteem. Perfectionism may also lead to procrastination as it allows one to avoid being less than perfect (\"I can't do this project until I can do it the right way.\"). This can mean low productivity. \nPerfectionistic behaviour is growing in the newer generation. Perfectionism has received more attention by popular sayings like \u201cpractice makes perfect\u201d. There are also more and more people who see themselves as a perfectionist. These people also mentioned their difficulties which comes with this behaviour.\nNormal vs Neurotic Perfectionism.\nIn 1978, D. E. Hamachek shows that there are two types of perfectionists: normal and neurotic. Normal perfectionists are people who set high goals for themselves. The main thing is that they are open to making some errors. Neurotic perfectionists also set high goals, but with no room for error. They view themselves strictly at all times. This makes them feel like nothing is done well enough.\nBoth types set high standards for themselves. This shows that the psychological problems that come with perfectionism come from viewing oneself strictly.\nThe Comprehensive Model of Perfectionism (CMPB).\nThere are a few models of perfectionism. In 2017, Hewitt et al. released one of the most detailed models. Their Comprehensive Model of Perfectionistic Behaviour splits perfectionism into many levels of a personality style. There are three levels:\n1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Trait level\n2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Self-presentational or other-relational level\n3. \u00a0 \u00a0 Cognitive or self-relational level\nThe first part of this model is multiple perfectionistic traits that are linked. They include self-oriented perfectionism, socially prescribed perfectionism and other-oriented perfectionism. These are measures of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS).\nThe second level is concerned with the image oneself presents to others. The relational part says that rather than needing to be perfect, there is a need to only appear so. This leads to displays of perfection and hiding imperfections. They avoid making mistakes in front of others or speaking about their imperfections. This is due to a fear of being judged badly by others which will cause feelings of low self-esteem.\nThe cognitive part of this model refers to repeated and automatic cognitive thoughts of needing to be perfect. There is a rumination of the difference between one\u2019s present actual self and the perfect self that one can / should be.\nMeasuring Perfectionism.\nMultidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS).\nEarly theorists suggest perfectionism as firm unrealistic goals for oneself. These clinical observations were important. However, it was not possible, to sum up perfectionism as a single term. This led Frost et al. in 1990 and in 1991, Hewitt and Flett, to come up with their own multidimensional scales of perfectionism.\nFrost's Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) measures 6 different dimensions of perfectionism:\n1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Concern over mistakes (CM),\n2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Very high personal standards (PS),\n3. \u00a0 \u00a0 Views of parental expectations (PE),\n4. \u00a0 \u00a0 Views of parental criticism (PC),\n5. \u00a0 \u00a0 Doubts about one\u2019s actions (D), and\n6. \u00a0 \u00a0 Organisation (O).\nExamples of CM: \u201cIf I fail at work / school, I fail as a person\u201d, \u201cIf I do not do as well as others, I am a worse human\u201d and \u201cThe less mistakes I make, the more people will like me\u201d.\nExamples of PS: \u201cIf I do not set the highest standards for myself, I will end up second\u201d and \u201cI expect a higher performance of myself than normal people\u201d.\nExamples of PE: \u201cMy parents wants me to be the best at everything\u201d.\nExamples of PC: \u201cI was punished if I did something less than perfect\u201d and \u201cI felt like I cannot meet my parent\u2019s standards\u201d.\nExamples of D: \u201cFeeling like a task is not done right, even though it was done very carefully\u201d.\nExamples of O: Liking to be neat and organised.\nHewitt &amp; Flett\u2019s MPS is a 45-item scale measuring three parts of perfectionism:\n1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Self-oriented perfectionism,\n2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Other-oriented perfectionism, and\n3. \u00a0 \u00a0 Socially prescribed perfectionism.\nThe difference between these parts is not behavioural displays. It is to whom perfectionism is directed to (self or others) or to whom the perfectionistic behaviour is placed by (socially prescribed).\nSelf-oriented perfectionism refers to the setting of impossible standards and strictly examining oneself. Although there are harmful effects, it also results in motivation by aiming to achieve perfection while avoiding failure.\nOther-oriented perfectionism is placing unrealistic standards for significant others. There is a focus on others being perfect and strictly examining them. This leads to blaming, lack of trust, and unkind feelings towards others. However, this dimension may link to leadership ability and giving motivation to others.\nSocially prescribed perfectionism is the believed need to achieve unrealistic standards placed by other people on oneself. As the standards placed by others are felt as too much, it may often lead to anger, anxiety and depression."}

The right has generally been given after long political campaigns. In many countries, it was recognised before universal suffrage. Before the late 19th century, a very few countries allowed women to vote in political elections.\nThe modern movement for women to gain the right to vote started in France in the late-18th century. The French Republic had been founded after a revolution, and political scientist Antoine Condorcet and activist Olympe de Gouges campaigned for women to be allowed to vote in the national election.\nIn early cases of women's suffrage, only those women who met certain requirements were given the right to vote in certain kinds of elections. In Sweden, there was conditional women's suffrage during the Age of Liberty (1718\u20131771). Unmarried women who owned property could vote in New Jersey from 1776 to 1807. In the 1792 election in Sierra Leone, all heads of household\u2014one-third of whom were women\u2014could vote.\nSeveral British colonies recognised women's suffrage before most countries. The female descendants of the \"Bounty\" mutineers who lived on Pitcairn Islands could vote from 1838. This right was kept when they were resettled on Norfolk Island in 1856. Women in South Australia allowed to vote in local elections from 1861, and those on the Isle of Man could vote in parliamentary elections from 1881. In 1893, New Zealand became the first independent country to give all adult women the right to vote in national elections. The women in South Australia got the same right in 1894, and became the first to get the right to stand (run) for seats in parliament.\nMany countries did the same soon after, following similar battles. Limited voting rights were also gained by women in several Western countries in the late\u00a019th\u00a0century, including Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom. Russian Empire was the first European country to introduce women's suffrage, in 1906. It also elected the world's first female members of parliament in its 1907 elections. At that time it was a part of the Russian Empire. In the years before World War\u00a0I, women in Norway (1913) and Denmark (1915) also won the right to vote, as did women in the other Australian states. In most other Western countries, women's suffrage came at the end of World War\u00a0I.\nCeylon, now called Sri Lanka, recognised the right in 1931. It elected the world's first female head of government, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, in the country's 1960 elections. Women's suffrage was explicitly recognised as a right by the United Nations in 1979."}

A group is a set with an operation. The group's operation shows how to replace any two elements of the group's set with a third element from the set in a useful way. A familiar example of a group is the set of integers with the addition operation.\nInstead of \"an element of the group's set\", mathematicians usually save words by saying \"an element of the group\".\nMathematicians use capital letters to stand for groups. They often use \"G\", \"H\", or \"K\".\nThey also use lower-case letters to stand for group elements. For example, they would say \"\"a\" is in \"G\" to mean \"a\" is an element of \"G\".\nThey write group operations with symbols like \u2022 or *, or by writing two elements next to each other. So \"a\" \u2022 \"b\", \"a\" * \"b\", and \"ab\"\" can all mean \"the element formed when the group's operation combines \"a\" and \"b\"\".\nGroup axioms.\nNot every set and operation make a group. A group's set and operation must obey some special rules. These are called group axioms. The following list has each axiom in both words and mathematical symbols.\nSome more ideas.\nTo name the group, one should say all three parts: (\"G\", \u2022, \"e\"). But when it is clear, one may just say that \"G\" is a group.\nIt is possible to find that for two elements \"a\" and \"b\" in a group, \"a\" \u2022 \"b\" is different from \"b\" \u2022 \"a\". For example, maybe \"a\" \u2022 \"b\" = c, but \"b\" \u2022 \"a\" = d.\nThe number of elements in a group is called the group's \"order\". \nAbelian groups.\nFor some groups, however, \"a\" \u2022 \"b\" = \"b\" \u2022 \"a\" for every \"a\" and \"b\" in the group. These special groups have a special name. They are called Abelian groups and their operation is said to be commutative\".\"\nSubgroups.\nSometimes, part of the group is also a group. In that case, the part is called a subgroup. For example, the even numbers numbers form a subgroup of the whole numbers, when the operation is addition, because adding any two even numbers gives another even number. Another example is the group of isometries of a shape, which is the set of ways the shape can be moved, including rotating or mirroring it. Performing any two movements in a row gives another movement, so the set of movements forms a group. A subgroup of movements that do not rotate the shape, but only shift it to another place in space, form a subgroup.\nExamples of groups.\nIntegers, addition, zero.\nOne everyday example of a group is the set of whole numbers (integers) with the addition operation. It is easy to see that when adding two integers, the result is always an integer. So closure is true. The identity element for this group is zero. Because the order of additions does not matter (in other words, formula_1), associativity rule is also true. And the inverse of any integer is its opposite number (the inverse element of zero is zero). This group is also an abelian group. It is an infinite group (also called a group of \"infinite order\") because it has an infinite number of elements: all the integers.\nThe set of integers with the multiplication operation is not a group, because with multiplication, most integers have no inverse that is also an integer (closure rule is not always obeyed).\nSymmetries.\nAnother important kind of groups are groups of symmetries. Symmetry groups provide many examples of groups. It can be proved that every group of finite order is a group of symmetries. For this reason, group theory is called the mathematical study of symmetry.\nObjects are symmetric if keep some interesting features when changed. Those changes of objects (of any kind) are called symmetries.\nSets have only elements in them so they are one of the simplest objects to think of. Symmetries of a set are one-to-one functions that shuffle the elements of this set. Those functions change elements one with other but for example keep their amount the same as before shuffling.\nWhen such group is finite (has finite order), say it has \"n\" elements, one can think of this group as the set of those shuffles (one-to-one functions) of \"n\" elements. The symmetric group given on \"n\" elements is often written as formula_2.\nShuffles can be combined one after another\u2014function composition is the \"operation\" of this group.\nBecause making shuffling after shuffling is yet another shuffling, that means that there is \"closure\". \nAlso three shuffles can be combined in any of two ways: first two in the beginning to give a shuffle to combine with a third one, or last two in the beginning to give a shuffle to be combined with the first one (\"associavity\").\nThe \"identity element\" is the shuffle in which nothing changes.\nAny shuffle can be undone by reversing the change. That reverse is the \"inverse element\".\nBecause order of shuffling matters\u2014it is important which of the shuffles go first\u2014group of symmetries are almost never abelian.\nThink of a square and (one-to-one) functions can that shuffle the place of points of the square but keep the square as a whole in one place. Interesting features are size and place of the square. Such symmetries are called (global) isometries (see congruence).\nHere are all of the isometries of a square: turn the square clockwise 90o, 180o, or 270o; turn the square counter-clockwise 90o, 180o, or 270o; reflect the image of the square in a vertical mirror, or in a horizontal mirror, or a diagonal mirror to the right or the left; or leave the square as it was.\nThis is a \"finite\" group, or a group of (finite) order 8, because there are 8 different isometries in total. It is a non-abelian group because it makes a difference which order when making a turn and a reflection.\nThis is not only kind of symmetry for this square. When position is not an interesting feature then there are many more symmetries. Then infinitely many moves are allowed. If the shape of a square is all that matters then there is even more symmetries of this square, those are similarities.\nThis shows that it is important to say what one exactly mean by \u2018symmetry\u2019. What are interesting features of objects that keep the same during a change.\nIdea to study geometry by studying symmetries of figures goes back to XIX century. It is how mathematicians think of geometry today. They even use those methods when studying different objects and speak about \u2018geometry\u2019 and \u2018symmetries\u2019 of strange objects.\nOther groups.\nMany things in mathematics are groups. This is mostly because groups help to benefit from a brilliant idea of \u2018a change that keeps interesting feature unchanged\", which are called symmetries. For example, equations. The ways of solving equations can be a group. Physical things can be studied as groups. There are important symmetries about physical things which are groups (this can be place, turn, time, energy, electric charge). \nMany useful things can be proved about groups and their subgroups, which is a study called group theory. For example, the order (number of elements) of any subgroup is always a factor of the group's order."}

The prize money was \u20a4200 including \u20a475 from a magazine and \u20a450 from a tobacco company. There were 32,823 designs entered into the competition.

The Prime Minister Edmund Barton wrote to the Governor-General to get approval from the King for the new flag. This was officially announced on February 20, 1903.\nThe flag.\nSome of the winning flags had different numbers of points on the stars of the Southern Cross. This was simplified to seven points for the four largest stars and five for the small one. The Commonwealth Star had six points for the six states. This was the design in 1903. In 1912, an extra point was added to the Commonwealth Star for the Territories of Australia.\nIn 1934, the government published how the Australian flag should be made. The flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack was still the official flag in Australia until 1954. By law, only the Australian government was allowed to fly the blue Australian flag. Everyone else that wanted to use an Australian flag used the red one, called the Red Ensign. On 15 March 1941, the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, gave permission for the blue flag to be used on public buildings, schools and by the public. Australian ships would use the Red Ensign.\nIn 1954, the Australian Flag became the official Australian National Flag. The Australian flag is the most important flag flown in Australia, and must be given more importance than flags from other countries. When it is raised or lowered people should face the flag and not talk. It should only be used properly, for example, it can not be used to cover a table or a seat, and it can not be allowed to touch the ground.\nOther Australian flags.\nThe Royal Australian Navy has had its own flag from 1 March 1967. This looks like the national flag but has a white background with blue stars, called the Australian White Ensign. The Royal Australian Air Force got its own flag in 1949. This was changed in 1981 to feature a red kangaroo.\nThe Queen of Australia has her own flag for use when she visits Australia. The Governor-General of Australia also has a flag which is flown from his or her official house and from his or her car."}

Bush was seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination, and despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and other candidates, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Many third-party candidates also ran, most prominently Ralph Nader. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, and Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, though the foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore did not often campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky scandal two years prior.\nBush narrowly won the November 7 election, with 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. There was a disagreement over who won Florida's 25 electoral votes because the way Florida voted was different from other states. A recount happened in the state and the uncommon event that the winner got fewer popular votes than the loser. The Court's decision in Bush v. Gore announced on December 12, 2000, this ended the recounts, effectively awarding Florida's votes to Bush and granting him the victory."}

The instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another. A typical instruction might say, add X and Y and put the result in Z. In this instruction, X, Y, and Z are the names of storage locations.\nIn order to have a compact instruction encoding, most processor instruction sets have a small set of special locations which can be directly named. For example, the x86 instruction set architecture has 8 integer registers, x86-64 has 16, many RISCs have 32, and IA-64 has 128. In smaller processors, the names of these locations correspond directly to elements of a register file.\nDifferent instructions may take different amounts of time (e.g., CISC architecture). For instance, a processor may be able to execute hundreds of instructions while a single load from main memory instruction is in progress. Shorter instructions executed while the load is outstanding will finish first, thus the instructions are finishing out of the original program order. Out-of-order execution has been used in most recent high-performance CPUs to achieve some of their speed gains.\nConsider this sequance of instructions running on an out-of-order CPU:\nInstructions 4, 5, and 6 are independent of instructions 1, 2, and 3, but the processor cannot finish 4 until 3 is done, because 3 would then write the wrong value.\nProblem solution.\nWe can remove this restriction by changing the names of some of the registers:\nNow instructions 4, 5, and 6 can be executed in parallel with instructions 1, 2, and 3, so that the program can be executed faster.\nWhen possible, compilers do this renaming. But compilers are limited by the number of register inside the CPU. Many high performance CPUs have more physical registers than may be named directly in the instruction set and they can rename registers in hardware to achieve better instruction level parallelism.\nAnything that is read and written can be renamed. While the general-purpose and floating-point registers are the most, flag and status registers or even individual status bits are commonly renamed as well.\nMemory locations can also be renamed, although it is not commonly done to the level used in register renaming.\nHazards Problem.\nWhen more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either reading it (as an input) or writing it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can cause to three kinds of problems, also known as hazards:"}

The accepted idea is that 4.6 billion years ago, there was a very big cloud of gas nearby our area of space, known as a nebula. \nAll things with mass come together, or gravitate towards one another. This pulled all the gas towards the center. Eventually the pressure at the center raised the temperature so that hydrogen atoms fused together to make helium. This began the star we know as the Sun. The process by which solar systems are created is called \"the nebular theory\". \nThe spin of the planets around the Sun, and each around its own axis, was first caused by the original gas cloud having different density in different places. The spin increased because of the contraction under gravity (conservation of energy). So did the flatness of the solar system's shape. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation accelerated. This largely prevents the gas from directly sticking onto the central core. The gas is forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn sticks onto the core.\nGravity caused the atoms in the Sun to become very close to each other. All this energy eventually made our star: the Sun. The leftover gas mostly went to the gas giants\u2014also known as Jovian planets. \nBecause of the Sun's huge mass (99.86% of the whole mass of the Solar System), it had very strong gravity. The centrifugal force of the planets going round the Sun balances the gravitational pull of the Sun. The huge density at its core causes a fusion reaction which turns hydrogen into helium with the radiation of heat, light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation.\nRock and dust makes the terrestrial planets, their moons, asteroids and all other objects in the Solar System. The gas giant planets also do have rocky or metallic centres. This is known from the data-gathering by satellites. This rocky material cannot come from the Sun, because the Sun is all hydrogen plus some helium.\nThe next issue is: \"if the Sun turns hydrogen into helium, where do all the other elements come from?\" There is only one possible answer: these higher elements came from earlier generations of stars. Huge supernovas which exploded billions of years ago in the neighbourhood of the young Solar System produced the higher elements. Huge stars run through their life cycle much faster than smaller stars. That is caused by the even higher pressures and temperatures inside them as compared with an average main sequence star like the Sun.\nHistory of the idea.\nThe nebular hypothesis, as it was called, was first worked out in the 18th century. Three men worked on it:\nSwedenborg first had the idea, and Kant worked it up into a proper theory. In 1755 Kant published his \"Universal natural history and theory of the heavens\" (in German, of course). He argued that gaseous clouds, nebulae, slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity. They eventually form stars and planets.\nMeanwhile, a similar model was developed independently and proposed in 1796 by Laplace. in his \"Exposition du systeme du monde\". He thought that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout the volume of the Solar System. His theory had a contracting and cooling protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. Unfortunately, there was a problem with Laplace's version. The main problem was the angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. It was quite a long time before this was understood.\nThe birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation \u2013 the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) \u2013 is due to the Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His book \"Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets\", translated to English in 1972, had a big effect. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed. There are still quite a few aspects of the Solar System which need to be explained. \nAlthough it originally applied only to our own Solar System, the SNDM is now thought to be the usual way of star formation throughout the universe. As of August 2017, over 3000 extrasolar planets have been discovered in our galaxy. \nMeteorites as clues to dates.\nThe nebular hypothesis says that the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant molecular cloud. The cloud was about 20\u00a0parsec (65 light years) across, while the fragments were roughly 1\u00a0parsec (three and a quarter light-years) across.\nBecause of the conservation of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, a hot, dense protostar began at the centre. \nThe oldest inclusions found in meteorites may be the first solid material to form in the presolar nebula. They are 4568.2\u00a0million years old. This is one definition of the age of the Solar System."}

Microarchitecture and instruction set architecture (ISA), together, constitute the field of computer architecture.\nOrigin of the term.\nComputers have been using microprogramming of control logic since the 1950s. The CPU decodes the instructions and sends signals down appropriate paths by means of transistor switches. The bits inside the microprogram words controlled the processor at the level of electrical signals.\nThe term: microarchitecture was used to describe the units that were controlled by the microprogram words, in contrast to the term: \"architecture\" that was visible and documented for programmers. While architecture usually had to be compatible between hardware generations, the underlying microarchitecture could be easily changed.\nRelation to instruction set architecture.\nThe microarchitecture is related to, but not the same as, the instruction set architecture. The instruction set architecture is near to the programming model of a processor as seen by an assembly language programmer or compiler writer, which includes the execution model, processor registers, memory address modes, address and data formats, etc. The microarchitecture (or computer organization) is mainly a lower level structure and therefore manage a large number of details that are hidden in the programming model. It describes the inside parts of the processor and how they work together in order to implement the architectural specification.\nMicroarchitectual elements may be everything from single logic gates, to registers, lookup tables, multiplexers, counters, etc., to complete ALUs, FPUs and even larger elements. The electronic circuitry level can, in turn, be subdivided into transistor-level details, such as which basic gate-building structures are used and what logic implementation types (static/dynamic, number of phases, etc.) are chosen, in addition to the actual logic design used built them.\nA few important points:\nSimplified descriptions.\nA very simplified high level description \u2014 common in marketing \u2014 may show only fairly basic characteristics, such as bus-widths, along with various types of execution units and other large systems, such as branch prediction and cache memories, pictured as simple blocks \u2014 perhaps with some important attributes or characteristics noted. Some details regarding pipeline structure (like fetch, decode, assign, execute, write-back) may sometimes also be included.\nAspects of microarchitecture.\nThe pipelined datapath is the most commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today. This technique is used in most modern microprocessors, microcontrollers, and DSPs. The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution, much like an assembly line. The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs. Some of these stages include instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, and write back. Some architectures include other stages such as memory access. The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks. \nExecution units are also essential to microarchitecture. Execution units include arithmetic logic units (ALU), floating point units (FPU), load/store units, and branch prediction. These units perform the operations or calculations of the processor. The choice of the number of execution units, their latency and throughput are important microarchitectural design tasks. The size, latency, throughput and connectivity of memories within the system are also microarchitectural decisions. \nSystem-level design decisions such as whether or not to include peripherals, such as memory controllers, can be considered part of the microarchitectural design process. This includes decisions on the performance-level and connectivity of these peripherals. \nUnlike architectural design, where a specific performance level is the main goal, microarchitectural design pays closer attention to other constraints. Attention must be paid to such issues as:\nMicro-Architectural Concepts.\nIn general, all CPUs, single-chip microprocessors or multi-chip implementations run programs by performing the following steps:\nComplicating this simple-looking series of steps is the fact that the memory hierarchy, which includes caching, main memory and non-volatile storage like hard disks, (where the program instructions and data are) has always been slower than the processor itself. Step (2) often introduces a delay (in CPU terms often called a \"stall\") while the data arrives over the computer bus. A big amount of research has been put into designs that avoid these delays as much as possible. Over the years, a central design goal was to execute more instructions in parallel, thus increasing the effective execution speed of a program. These efforts introduced complicated logic and circuit structures.\nIn the past such techniques could only be implemented on expensive mainframes or supercomputers due to the amount of circuitry needed for these techniques. As semiconductor manufacturing progressed, more and more of these techniques could be implemented on a single semiconductor chip.\nWhat follows is a survey of micro-architectural techniques that are common in modern CPUs. \nInstruction Set choice.\nThe choice of which Instruction Set Architecture to use greatly affects the complexity of implementing high performance devices. Over the years, computer designers did their best to simplify instruction sets, in order to enable higher performance implementations by saving designers effort and time for features which improve performance rather than wasting them on the complexity of instruction set. \nInstruction set design has progressed from CISC, RISC, VLIW, EPIC types. Architectures that are dealing with data parallelism include SIMD and Vectors.\nInstruction pipelining.\nOne of the first, and most powerful, techniques to improve performance is the use of the instruction pipeline. Early processor designs performed all of the steps above on one instruction before moving onto the next. Large portions of the processor circuitry were left idle at any one step; for instance, the instruction decoding circuitry would be idle during execution and so on.\nPipelines improve performance by allowing a number of instructions to work their way through the processor at the same time. In the same basic example, the processor would start to decode (step 1) a new instruction while the last one was waiting for results. This would allow up to four instructions to be \"in flight\" at one time, making the processor look four times as fast. Although any one instruction takes just as long to complete (there are still four steps) the CPU as a whole \"retires\" instructions much faster and can be run at a much higher clock speed.\nCache.\nImprovements in chip manufacturing allowed more circuitry to be placed on the same chip, and designers started looking for ways to use it. One of the most common ways was to add an ever-increasing amount of cache memory on-chip. Cache is a very fast memory, memory that can be accessed in a few cycles as compared to what is needed to talk to main memory. The CPU includes a cache controller which automates reading and writing from the cache, if the data is already in the cache it simply \"appears,\" whereas if it is not the processor is \"stalled\" while the cache controller reads it in.\nRISC designs started adding cache in the mid-to-late 1980s, often only 4\u00a0KB in total. This number grew over time, and typical CPUs now have about 512\u00a0KB, while more powerful CPUs come with 1 or 2 or even 4, 6, 8 or 12\u00a0MB, organized in multiple levels of a memory hierarchy. Generally speaking, more cache means more speed.\nCaches and pipelines were a perfect match for each other. Previously, it didn't make much sense to build a pipeline that could run faster than the access latency of off-chip cash memory. Using on-chip cache memory instead, meant that a pipeline could run at the speed of the cache access latency, a much smaller length of time. This allowed the operating frequencies of processors to increase at a much faster rate than that of off-chip memory.\nBranch Prediction and Speculative execution.\nPipeline stalls and flushes due to branches are the two main things preventing achieving higher performance through instruction level parallelism. The from time that the processor's instruction decoder has found that it has encountered a conditional branch instruction to the time that the deciding jumping register value can be read out, the pipeline might be stalled for several cycles. On average, every fifth instruction executed is a branch, so that's a high amount of stalling. If the branch is taken, its even worse, as then all of the subsequent instructions which were in the pipeline needs to be flushed. \nTechniques such as branch prediction and speculative execution are used to reduce these branch penalties. Branch prediction is where the hardware makes educated guesses on whether a particular branch will be taken. The guess allows the hardware to prefetch instructions without waiting for the register read. Speculative execution is a further enhancement in which the code along the predicted path is executed before it is known whether the branch should be taken or not.\nOut-of-order execution.\nThe addition of caches reduces the frequency or duration of stalls due to waiting for data to be fetched from the main memory hierarchy, but does not get rid of these stalls entirely. In early designs a \"cache miss\" would force the cache controller to stall the processor and wait. Of course there may be some other instruction in the program whose data \"is\" available in the cache at that point. Out-of-order execution allows that ready instruction to be processed while an older instruction waits on the cache, then re-orders the results to make it appear that everything happened in the programmed order.\nSuperscalar.\nEven with all of the added complexity and gates needed to support the concepts outlined above, improvements in semiconductor manufacturing soon allowed even more logic gates to be used. \nIn the outline above the processor processes parts of a single instruction at a time. Computer programs could be executed faster if multiple instructions were processed simultaneously. This is what superscalar processors achieve, by replicating functional units such as ALUs. The replication of functional units was only made possible when the integrated circuit (some times called \"die\") area of a single-issue processor no longer stretched the limits of what could be reliably manufactured. By the late 1980s, superscalar designs started to enter the market place. \nIn modern designs it is common to find two load units, one store (many instructions have no results to store), two or more integer math units, two or more floating point units, and often a SIMD unit of some sort. The instruction issue logic grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different execution units that are idle at that point. The results are then collected and re-ordered at the end.\nRegister renaming.\nRegister renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions. Suppose we have to groups of instruction that will use the same register, one set of instruction is executed first to leave the register to the other set, but if the other set is assigned to a different similar register both sets of instructions can be executed in parallel.\nMultiprocessing and multithreading.\nDue to the growing gap between CPU operating frequencies and DRAM access times, none of the techniques that enhance instruction-level parallelism (ILP) within one program could overcome the long stalls (delays) that occurred when data had to be fetched from main memory. Additionally, the large transistor counts and high operating frequencies needed for the more advanced ILP techniques required power dissipation levels that could no longer be cheaply cooled. For these reasons, newer generations of computers have started to utilize higher levels of parallelism that exist outside of a single program or program thread.\nThis trend is sometimes known as \"throughput computing\". This idea originated in the mainframe market where online transaction processing emphasized not just the execution speed of one transaction, but the capacity to deal with big numbers of transactions at the same time. With transaction-based applications such as network routing and web-site serving greatly increasing in the last decade, the computer industry has re-emphasized capacity and throughput issues.\nOne technique of how this parallelism is achieved is through multiprocessing systems, computer systems with multiple CPUs. In the past this was reserved for high-end mainframes but now small scale (2-8) multiprocessors servers have become commonplace for the small business market. For large corporations, large scale (16-256) multiprocessors are common. Even personal computers with multiple CPUs have appeared since the 1990s.\nAdvances in semiconductor technology reduced transistor size; multicore CPUs have appeared where multiple CPUs are implemented on the same silicon chip. Initially used in-chips targeting embedded markets, where simpler and smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiations to fit on one piece of silicon. By 2005, semiconductor technology allowed dual high-end desktop CPUs \"CMP\" chips to be manufactured in volume. Some designs, such as UltraSPARC T1 used a simpler (scalar, in-order) designs in order to fit more processors on one piece of silicon.\nRecently, another technique that has become more popular is multithreading. In multithreading, when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory, instead of stalling for the data to arrive, the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute. Though this does not speed up a particular program/thread, it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle.\nConceptually, multithreading is equivalent to a context switch at the operating system level. The difference is that a multithreaded CPU can do a thread switch in one CPU cycle instead of the hundreds or thousands of CPU cycles a context switch normally requires. This is achieved by replicating the state hardware (such as the register file and program counter) for each active thread.\nA further enhancement is simultaneous multithreading. This technique allows superscalar CPUs to execute instructions from different programs/threads simultaneously in the same cycle."}

At first the trams were horse-drawn, but later they were powered by electricity.\nBackground.\nSouthampton, a city of the United Kingdom located in Hampshire, was becoming bigger in the nineteenth century. The population was 27,000 people in 1841. This was because the docks were becoming much more used. Also, a railway openened in 1839 and a horse-drawn omnibus service started at as well. By 1843 a regular service was running from the station to Millbrook, Eling, Bitterne, Shirley, Portswood, Totton and Romsey. Because of this, by 1861 the population had become 42,000.\nBy 1872 tramways were a lot more popular. The British and Foreign Tramway Company contacted Southampton Corporation with an idea to set up a tramway in the town. Lots of people were against the idea. The Corporation did not allow tram tracks to be put in the High Street and Above Bar. The British and Foreign Tramway Company stopped thinking about the idea.\nIn 1876 Southampton Corporation saw that their public transport was not as good as the public transport in other cities. The Southampton Tramways Company was made to build a new tramway system. The tramway started to be built in the summer of 1878.\nSouthampton Tramways Company.\nThe first tram ran on 5 May 1879. The tramway made \u00a326. Many people did not want the trams to run on a Sunday, and 3,500 people put their names on a petition to stop the trams running on a Sunday. The company's manager said that there were lots of people who rode on the trams on Sunday and that the service would continue. If the service made money on a Sunday, then the trams would keep running. The first tram route that opened was Stag Gate - Holy Rood. A second route opened on 6 May 1879 which was Alma Road - Canute Road - Oxford Street - High Street - Floating Dock and Stag Gates - Lodge Road - Portswood. The Tramway Junction - Commercial Road - Shirley route opened on 9 June 1879.\nThe company got into some trouble soon after it opened. One of the managers ran away with some money to America in 1881. Another manager got the sack in 1882 because there was a problem with the company's money. By 1887 though the company had recovered. It had a good financial base to stand on, and it was paying divedends of 8% a year to its shareholders. On the 22 October 1889, the Portswood route ran via Spear Road and Avenue Road. Fares cost less money in 1896 because they changed from 3d to 2d for \"through routes\". The tram times became two times as fast to every 5 minutes from Stag Gates to Holy Rood. Four new trams and forty horses were needed to run this service.\nThe Southampton Tramway Company was bought by Southampton Corporation on 30 June 1898 for \u00a351,000.\nTrams.\nThe tramway had twenty-three tramcars when it was bought in 1898. They were:\nSouthampton Corporation bought the Southampton Electric Light and Power Company in 1896. Two years later in 1898 it bought the Southampton Tramway Company two years later in 1898. This allowed them to change the town's tramway system to electricity instead of horse power. In 1899 a group of people from the Corporation visited tram systems in Bradford, Dover, Glasgow, Liverpool and London for ideas. They decided that Southampton's was going to be based on Liverpool's. The first electric tram route from Junction to Shirley opened on 22 January 1900. The second route from Stag Gates to Holy Road via Prospect Place opened on 29 May 1900. Over the next 3 years the system slowly got bigger. The following routes opened:\nThe last route to open as part of the first stage of the electrified system was Portswood - Hampton Park on 25 July 1903.\nBefore World War One more routes were added:\nAfter the war, more new routes were added:\nAfter thiese additions, the system was at its biggest. The only new lines opened after this were to miss out the Bargate Arch in Southampton. The east side opened on 24 April 1932 and the west side on 5 June 1938.\nBefore World War 2, two routes were also closed. Roberts Road - Millbrook closed on 2 October 1935 except for workmen's services. It did however re-open whilst the war was happening. The second route to close was Clock Tower - Northam Bridge, which closed on 4 June 1926.\nTrams.\nWhen the electrified system opened it needed some new tramcars to replace the horse drawn ones. The first trams used on the system were built by G F Milnes &amp; Co., Birkenhead. They had open upper deck had back-to-back \"knifeboard\" seats so that they could fit under Bargate arch. No.2 was changed into a \"toastrack\" car in 1916. It was sold to Portsmouth in 1919 where it became Number 104. In 1903 twelve trams were built by Hurst, Nelson &amp; Co. The trams originally had three windows on each side on the bottom deck. This was later chnged to have four windows on each side because the original design did not give enough support for the top deck. Two bogie trams were ordered in 1910. This order was later cancelled. The system also bought six ex-London County Council Tramways cars with enclosed upper decks. These were numbered 75-80. A final sixteen trams were bought in 1918. As well as these, a number of trams were built by the tramway:\nRound topped \"Bargate\" trams.\nBefore 1932, the only road route between Southampton High Street and Above Bar was through the arch in the centre of the Bargate. In 1923 a new design of enclosed double deck tram was built by P.J Baker, General Manager of the tramways. It had a rounded top that would fit through the arch. These trams had smaller wheels to help reduce the tram's height. They were driven by high speed motors which produced more torque. However, the roadway through the arch in the Bargate still had to be lowered to allow the trams to pass through the arch. Some secret changing of the profile of the arch's masonry was also needed at the last minute. Trams started to pass around the East of the Bargate on 24 April 1932. The last tram to pass through the central archway did so on 4 June 1938. By this time part of Southampton ancient walls had been demolished so that the Bargate was passable on both sides.\nWorld War One.\nSouthampton Tramways were mainly affected by staffing issues during World War I. To try and stop this women were allowed to become \"conductorettes\". Because of this toastrack tram No.2 had a gangway cut through the middle of it. In the early years of the war a tram went round Southampton for two hours twice a week. It had a military band playing on the top deck. This was an effort to try and boost recruitment.\nWorld War Two.\nWorld War II affected Southampton much more than World War One. Women were again employed by the company. Unlike in World War I though they were allowed to drive the trams this time.\nCar No.31 was destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 30 November 1940. It was the only tram to be destroyed during the war. To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II they were painted grey. Regular services stopped at 7pm and they were parked up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common for the same reason.\nIn November 1942, a tram was accidentally set in motion whilst parked up overnight. It took two other trams with it. The unmanned convoy of trams was stopped by a lorry before anybody was hurt. The incident caused some worry locally because it was thought that saboteurs were responsible. It later emerged that the incident was due to a young boy playing on the trams.\nClosure.\nThe trams in Southampton made good profits for Southampton Corporation. However the Corporation had not put those profits back into the tram system. Because of this the whole system needed modernisation by the end of the Second World War. This included the trams, the power supply and the track.\nIt was decided that buses were a better alternative to modernising the trams. The tramway system therefore closed. The first line to close was Bitterne Park - St. Mary's - Docks on 15 May 1948. Swaythling - Portswood - Lodge Road - Stag Gates closed on 30 October 1948. Swaythling - Burgess Road - Bassett Crossroads - Avenue Junction closed on 5 March 1949. Floating Bridge - Shirley, Holy Rood - High Street - Royal Pier and Roberts Road - Millbrook all closed on 31 December 1949. The last movement of a tram in Southampton was on 4 February 1950 when cars No.21 and No.101 were moved from Shirley depot to Portswood depot under their own power. After the system closed some trams were sold to Leeds. The majority though were sent to A F Harris's scrapyard at Bevois Valley for scrapping. A few were sold on from there to be used as sheds or summer houses. This allowed some trams to be preserved.\nPreservation.\nThree Southampton trams have survived."}

With this, certain states of the European Union will send police forces as well as lawyers to help make Kosovo more secure. This is what was agreed by the Ahtisaari plan. The idea is to continue the presence of foreign police forces to help the police in Kosovo, as planned under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. Russia and Serbia see this mission as illegal. The plan is to have 2.000 police force and lawyers on the ground. The mission started to deploy its forces on 16 February 2008. Currently only 400 of the some 1,900 police officers and judges foreseen by the EULEX mission are in place.\nComposition and deployment.\nThe European Council agreed on sending 1800 to 1900 people on 14 December 2007. Because of the unstable political climate, this force was later increased to 2000 people. Primarily this was done because it was impossible to reach an agreement with Serbia. The force is made up mainly of police officers. Some of the officers have received training on how to control rioting crowds. Some people of the force are prosecutors and judges. Because the force is so big, there will soon be the most EU civil servants doing their job there, rather than in Brussels. Chief of the mission is Yves de Kermabon, who is accountable to the European Union Special Representative in Kosovo, Pieter Feith. The mission is expected to cost \u20ac165 million in its first year.\nThe final decision on the mission was planned to be taken on 28 January 2008. This was postponed due to concerns over possible negative effects on the second round of the presidential election in Serbia on 3 February 2008 and the possible signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia on that date. The officially voiced reason for the postponement is the lack of a legal basis (through a UNSC resolution or something similar) for the mission. A Joint Action was approved on 4 February 2008, meaning that only the final approval is required; it is expected to be given on 18 February 2008.\nThere are still questions on how this mission should replace the UN administration in Kosovo. Until these are answered, Spain will not take part in the mission. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel \u00c1ngel Moratinos told a meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers that Spain will not send its contingent to the EULEX mission until there has been a formal transfer of powers from the United Nations.\nApart from EU members, third parties Turkey, Switzerland, Norway and the United States will also take part.\nPolitical situation.\nThe countries of the European Union are currently divided. Some recognise Kosovo, whilst others do not. The current Presidency of the European Council said\nthat countries could send people to take part in the mission, even without recognising Kosovo as an independent state.\nAccording to the EU, the mission will be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. This resolution introduced international rule in Kosovo in 1999. The EU force has not yet received a new UN Security Council directive, because Russia opposed it. Russia blocked the transfer of the UN mission to the EU. According to Serbia, the mission implies that the EU recognises Kosovo as an independent state."}

They are native to Central and South America. \nUnlike many frogs, these are active during the day. They often have brightly-coloured bodies, which act as warning colouration. All dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic. In the wild, frog of different species and in different places may have very different levels of toxicity. Many species are critically endangered. \nPoison dart frogs are poisonous because they eat ants and other small insects that have toxins in their bodies. If an animal eats the frog, it will become very sick. \nToxicity.\nMany poison dart frogs secrete alkaloid toxins through their skin. Alkaloids in the skin glands of poison frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation. They are able to be active alongside potential predators during the day. About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison frogs. \nThe most toxic of poison dart frog species is \"Phyllobates terribilis\". As mentioned above, dart frogs do not make their own poisons, but keep (sequester) the chemicals from arthropod prey, such as ants, centipedes and mites. This is the diet-toxicity hypothesis. Because of this, captive-bred animals do not have significant levels of toxins: they are reared on diets that do not have the alkaloids used by wild populations. Nonetheless, the captive-bred frogs can store up alkaloids if they get an alkaloid-containing diet. \nMost wild species are not lethal to their predators, but rather taste foul enough that frogs are released immediately. Despite the toxins used by some poison dart frogs, some predators can withstand them. One is the snake \"Leimadophis epinephelus\", which has developed immunity to the poison.\nTaxonomy.\nDart frogs are the focus of many studies. Their scientific names may sometimes change. Family Dendrobatidae was revised in 2006 and now has 12 genera, with about 170 species.\nColour morphs.\nSome poison dart frogs species include a number of colour morphs that evolved as recently as 6,000 years ago. \nPredation does influence the evolution of polymorphism, for example, in \"O. granulifera\". Sexual selection has contributed to differentiation among the Bocas del Toro populations of \"Oophaga pumilio\".\nOther websites.\nDyeing Poison Frog. ARKive, n.d.

Iniki was a powerful hurricane that affected Hawaii, just weeks after Hurricane Andrew stuck Florida during the Atlantic hurricane season.\nHistory.\nThe origin of Iniki is unclear, but it possibly began as a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on August\u00a018. It moved westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and crossed Central America into the Pacific on the 28th. the shock wave continued to go west, and remained disorganized. Conditions slowly became more favorable, and, as the convection concentrated around a center, the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on September\u00a05, located 1,700\u00a0miles (2700\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico or 1550\u00a0miles (2500\u00a0km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until the 8th, when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm. Iniki continued to get stronger and became a hurricane on September\u00a09. It turned north towards Hawaii and became major Hurricane the next day. On September\u00a011, Iniki peaked as Category\u00a04 hurricane and hit Hawaii with wind of 145\u00a0mph. Hurricane Iniki rapidly weakened and went extra tropical Midway between Also and Hawaii.\nPreparations and Impact.\nThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance. For several days prior to the disaster, the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain, with the only effect being some high surf conditions. Some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated Hawaiian Islands, but these were rejected by the CPHC forecasters. CHPC Advisory #19 was issued at 11 AM local time on September 10, and suggested that a weakening Iniki would remain well to the south. It was not until a special bulletin was issued by the CPHC at 6:30 PM on September 10 - less than 24\u00a0hours before landfall - that any warning was given to the public. \nA hurricane watch was issued for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000\u00a0people were housed in shelters, most of whom remembered Hurricane Iwa 10\u00a0years prior. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage. During the evacuation of the island, people left days before to family, friends or shelters. Because schools were cancelled, traffic was light and evacuation was well-executed.\nThe CPHC issued a tropical storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000\u00a0people to evacuate to 110\u00a0public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.\nHurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaii, causing $1.8\u00a0billion ($2.6\u00a0billion in 2004 US dollars) in damage.

It was first published anonymously in Paris in 1697 in \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9\" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault.\nThe story is about an ill-treated girl who, with the help of her fairy godmother, travels to a ball in a pumpkin coach. She flees the ball at midnight and loses her glass slipper. A prince, who has fallen in love with her, finds her lost slipper and uses it later to find her.\nSimilar European tales are found in Bonaventure des Periers's \"New Recreations and Joyous Games\" (1558) and Giambattista Basile's \"Pentamerone\" (1634-6). The Brothers Grimm included their version, \"Aschenputtel\", in \"Children's and Household Tales\" (1812). Tales similar to \"Cinderella\" exist in Chinese, Indian, African, Javanese, Australian, and Japanese literature and folklore. The tale has been adapted to the stage, movies, television, and other media.\nStory.\nA widower marries a proud and haughty woman. She already has two daughters of her own. They despise the man's daughter by his first marriage, but she is gentle and beautiful, They treat her meanly. She is assigned all the housework and sleeps in the attic. She gave her the name Cinderella because she sits in the chimney corner.\nA prince gives a ball and all the ladies of quality are invited. Cinderella's stepsisters go to the ball, but Cinderella remains at home crying. Her fairy godmother appears and transforms a pumpkin into a golden coach to take Cinderella to the ball. The fairy turns mice, lizards, and a rat into horses and coachmen with a wave of her wand. She gives Cinderella a gown of gold and silver and slippers made of glass. She orders Cinderella to return home by midnight for the charm ends at that time. Cinderella goes to the ball and dazzles everyone. The prince pays her special attention. Her stepsisters do not recognize her. She leaves at midnight and returns home. The next evening she again goes to the prince's ball. She loses track of time, hurries away just at midnight, but loses one of her glass slippers. At home, Cinderella's gown turns to rags, but the other glass slipper remains as it is.\nThe stepsisters tell her that the prince is in love with the unknown beautiful lady. The prince orders the slipper to be tried on all the ladies in the land. He will marry only the girl whose foot will fit the slipper. The stepsisters try it on but it does not fit. Cinderella tries it on and it fits. She pulls the other slipper from her pocket and puts it on. The Godmother appears and touches Cinderella's clothes with her wand. They are transformed into a gown more beautiful than that she wore to the ball. A few days later, the prince marries her. She forgives her stepsisters for their past meanness and finds husbands for them at the court."}

{"id": "140459", "revid": "7409", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140459", "title": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy", "text": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy which aims to help people transform their maladaptive thoughts and behaviours into a better state of being. Psychologists task patients to try out different situational coping skills and help patients to acknowledge, then challenge those problematic thought patterns, feelings and behaviors. CBT refers to many types of psychotherapeutic systems that deal with cognitions, interpretations, beliefs and responses. These systems come from strategies commonly used in cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, combining them. This combination is used to identify problems faced in the present and tries to improve the patient's current state of mind. \nCBT has emerged as a common treatment for concerns regarding moods. It has become increasingly popular for reasons such as its defined structure and that it is based on common sense. Research shows that CBT is the most effective form of treatment for those coping with depression and anxiety. CBT alone is 50-75% effective for overcoming depression and anxiety after 5 \u2013 15 modules. Medication alone is effective, however, science still does not understand the long-term effects on the brain and body. There is evidence which suggests that CBT may be more cost-efficient in the long run in comparison to medication. Although, a combination of medication and CBT seems to be the most effective in overcoming mental illness. In particular, antidepressants paired with CBT could reduce potential relapses in patients facing depression.\nCBT is often recommended for mood-related disorders such as depression and anxiety, but it can also treat personality disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders. CBT can take place one-on-one between a therapist and a client, during group therapy, or online.\nThe History of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.\nIn the early 1900s, Austrian psychotherapist Alfred Adler\u2019s notion of basic mistakes and their role in unpleasant emotions made him one of the earliest therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy. His work inspired American psychologist Albert Ellis to develop rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) in the 1950s. This is now considered one of the earliest forms of cognitive psychotherapy. It is based on the idea that a person\u2019s emotional distress arises from their thoughts about an event rather than the actual event itself.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck noticed that his clients had internal dialogues going on in their minds during analytical sessions. He discovered that the clients appeared to almost be talking to themselves, but they only shared a small part of this kind of thinking with him. For example, a person might have thought to themselves, \u201cThe therapist is being very quiet today; I wonder if he\u2019s mad at me?\u201d and then began to feel anxious as a result.\nCBT is based on a cognitive model of mental illness which Beck proposed. As shown in the example above, the model suggests our emotions are a result of our interpretations of events. Beck put forward three levels of cognition which are core beliefs, dysfunctional assumptions and negative automatic thoughts. Core beliefs seems to be a common issue in patients, an example is Beck's negative triad. This is composed of what seems to be irrational thoughts about the self, the world and the future. This may be evident in patients facing depression. Beck used his model as a starting point to develop CBT so that we can improve our understanding about emotions and behaviour. \nIn the 1960s, a number of empirical studies into how cognitions affect behaviours and emotions were carried out. This is known as the cognitive revolution. It emphasised the role that conscious thinking plays in psychotherapy and is known as the \u201csecond wave\u201d of CBT.\nHow it works.\nCBT targets different kinds of maladaptive thinking. The goal is to recognise unhealthy thoughts and develop them into positive thinking patterns. In that sense, CBT is scientific because irrational beliefs are thought of as theories which are tested to see if they are true. CBT is structured in that it uses an ABC format. A represents the activating event which triggers B, your beliefs. This is followed by C, the consequences, which are your actions. Beliefs are composed of different types of thinking. Some examples include catastrophising where small problems are blown out of proportion and all-or-nothing thinking which involves thinking in extremes. When creating solutions, the therapist and patient need to come to an agreement on attainable goals. They follow a criteria which is characterised as SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-limited. Specific and measurable highlight the science behind CBT as the goals are used to test the \"hypothesis\". Achievable, realistic and time-limited ensure that the patient makes small stages of progress through the intervention. \nTechniques.\nOne of the key reasons why CBT is so effective is because of its interactive nature. This is known as collaborative empiricism; the patient and therapist work together in targeting problems and changing negative mindsets. This means that patients play an active role in improving their mental health which is a key element that distinguishes CBT from other treatments. Therapists encourage patients to be active by setting them tasks. This may be noting down positive moments throughout their day or producing a list of things to complete. CBT combines cognitive and behavioural methods to maximise its effect. Therapists often set their patients homework which challenge their irrational beliefs. When patients feel down because of these beliefs, the therapist can produce this as evidence. An example of a behavioural method is that therapists help their patients to collect evidence that challenges the use of their avoidance behaviours. The techniques aim to prepare patient with the skills they need to target their problems independently in the future. \nUses.\nCognitive-behavior therapy can be effectively used as a short-term treatment centered on helping people with a very specific problem and teaching them to focus on present thoughts and beliefs.\nWhy it's effective.\nCBT is now increasingly recommended because it is successful in changing the patient's way of thinking. As previously mentioned, it's effective because patients participate in improving their mental health. They are encouraged to be proactive by acting as their own therapist. This means that once the sessions are over, patients are left with the skills they need to manage their problems. Furthermore, it works because the patient and therapist develop a healthy relationship. It is built upon understanding, cooperation and empathy. Therapists show patience when patients struggle to identify their negative thoughts or when adopting new coping mechanisms. Compromise is also a key element in this relationship, if a strategy is not working, they are willing to work together to find a better solution. It is also effective because CBT focuses mainly on the present. It does not dive into the patient's past because CBT aims to improve the patient's current state of mind. \nCriticisms.\nDespite its popular recommendations, CBT has faced criticism. Arguably, CBT fails to focus on the patient as a whole. This may be because CBT focuses solely on the patient's present. By ignoring the patient's past, therapists may be overlooking the origin of their maladaptive thinking. This makes it difficult to identify solutions if the therapist ignores the underlying issue. Furthermore, CBT is known for its interactive element. This may be counterproductive in patients who face mood-related disorders which are associated with reduced energy levels such as depression.\nRevisions.\nSince the emergence of CBT, several revisions and models have been made. One example is the Five Areas model. This model was created because traditional CBT tends to use complex terms which may be unsuitable for some patients or colleagues who do not specialise in CBT. The Five Areas model aims to be more versatile by using language that can easily be understood. In that sense, this model is not a new approach. Instead, it is a revision of standard CBT. The Five Areas model specifically focuses on five key elements, hence the name. These are life situation, altered thinking, altered emotions, altered physical feelings and altered behaviour. "}

Francine Shapiro, Ph.D., noted that recalling or thinking about disturbing events, coupled with eye-motion; audio input or sensory input (touch, smell, taste) could aid unprocessed emotional trauma that are emotionally hurtful or painful to the body. The once painful emotional materials are un-embedded via recall of the event coupled with a sensory input which are 'metabolized' by the person's psyche from a painful and harmful state into a helpful learning experience. This processing has proven useful in helping overcome many traumatic events ranging from rape, family violence, physical or verbal abuse, first-responder shock, chronic pain, combat, hurtful memories; select health issues and unresolved, hurtful life experiences. \nEMDR involves the processing of painful emotional events via the recalling of the event...paired with movement of the eyes; the hearing of select sound; tactile contact; gustatory (taste) input as an input into the brains processing. This process helps the client to move-on from the physical or emotional pain they are feeling. EMDR or Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) as it is alternatively named, has been being tested and researched in a large number of organizations since it was first discovered in 1987. \nLike all psychological theorems and processes it has it's admiring adherents and strong critics. \nThe EMDR has training and trainers licensed internationally and over 10,000 psychologists and therapists qualified to practice in the U.S. \nTREATMENT DESCRIPTION \nEMDR therapy combines different elements to maximize treatment effects.\u00a0 A full description of the theory, sequence of treatment, and research on protocols and active mechanisms can be found in F. Shapiro (2001) Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing:\u00a0 Basic principles, protocols and procedures (2nd edition) New York: Guilford Press. \nEMDR therapy involves attention to three time periods:\u00a0 the past, present, and future.\u00a0 Focus is given to past disturbing memories and related events.\u00a0 Also, it is given to current situations that cause distress, and to developing the skills and attitudes needed for positive future actions.\u00a0 With EMDR therapy, these items are addressed using an eight-phase treatment approach.\nPhase 1:\u00a0 The first phase is a history-taking session(s).\u00a0 The therapist assesses the client\u2019s readiness and develops a treatment plan.\u00a0 Client and therapist identify possible targets for EMDR processing.\u00a0 These include distressing memories and current situations that cause emotional distress.\u00a0 Other targets may include related incidents in the past.\u00a0 Emphasis is placed on the development of specific skills and behaviors that will be needed by the client in future situations.\nInitial EMDR processing may be directed to childhood events rather than to adult onset stressors or the identified critical incident if the client had a problematic childhood.\u00a0 Clients generally gain insight on their situations, the emotional distress resolves and they start to change their behaviors.\u00a0 The length of treatment depends upon the number of traumas and the age of PTSD onset.\u00a0 Generally, those with single event adult onset trauma can be successfully treated in under 5 hours.\u00a0 Multiple trauma victims may require a longer treatment time.\nPhase 2:\u00a0 During the second phase of treatment, the therapist ensures that the client has several different ways of handling emotional distress.\u00a0 The therapist may teach the client a variety of imagery and stress reduction techniques the client can use during and between sessions. A goal of EMDR therapy is to produce rapid and effective change while the client maintains equilibrium during and between sessions.\nPhases 3-6:\u00a0 In phases three to six, a target is identified and processed using EMDR therapy procedures.\u00a0 These involve the client identifying three things:\n1.\u00a0 The vivid visual image related to the memory\n2.\u00a0 A negative belief about self\n3.\u00a0 Related emotions and body sensations.\nIn addition, the client identifies a positive belief.\u00a0 The therapist helps the client rate the positive belief as well as the intensity of the negative emotions.\u00a0 After this, the client is instructed to focus on the image, negative thought, and body sensations while simultaneously engaging in EMDR processing using sets of bilateral stimulation.\u00a0 These sets may include eye movements, taps, or tones.\u00a0 The type and length of these sets is different for each client.\u00a0 At this point, the EMDR client is instructed to just notice whatever spontaneously happens.\nAfter each set of stimulation, the clinician instructs the client to let his/her mind go blank and to notice whatever thought, feeling, image, memory, or sensation comes to mind.\u00a0 Depending upon the client\u2019s report, the clinician will choose the next focus of attention.\u00a0 These repeated sets with directed focused attention occur numerous times throughout the session.\u00a0 If the client becomes distressed or has difficulty in progressing, the therapist follows established procedures to help the client get back on track.\nWhen the client reports no distress related to the targeted memory, (s)he is asked to think of the preferred positive belief that was identified at the beginning of the session.\u00a0 At this time, the client may adjust the positive belief if necessary, and then focus on it during the next set of distressing events.\nPhase 7:\u00a0 In phase seven, closure, the therapist asks the client to keep a log during the week.\u00a0 The log should document any related material that may arise.\u00a0 It serves to remind the client of the self-calming activities that were mastered in phase two.\nPhase 8:\u00a0 The next session begins with phase eight.\u00a0 Phase eight consists of examining the progress made thus far.\u00a0 The EMDR treatment processes all related historical events, current incidents that elicit distress, and future events that will require different responses."}

Naltrexone can help with overdose, but naloxone is more helpful in those cases.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends naltrexone for people who are fully detoxed from alcohol or opioids and are highly motivated to remain abstinent. Naltrexone is also sometimes used off-label to treat opioid and nicotine withdrawal as well. Although naltrexone is a helpful medication, it is not a cure for alcohol or opioid dependence. To be effective, naltrexone must be combined with other psychosocial therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy or motivational interviewing, or with a 12-step program such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.\nHistory.\nNaloxone was first synthesized and subsequently patented in 1961 by Drs. Jack Fischman and Mozez Lewenstein of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, based on a theory proposed by their colleague, Dr. Harold Blumberg at the Long Island-based Endo Laboratories.

Now called Doc Ock by the press, Otto attempts to rob a bank vault for cash, but is foiled by Spider-Man in the process.\nLater, Peter promises to attend Mary Jane Watson's play, but is distracted by a crime in progress and has to go fight it and arrest the criminal. He cannot go into the play afterwards and Mary Jane likes him less for missing the play. He finally decides to give up the Spider-Man costume and become a normal person.\nWithout Spider-Man in his life, Peter's grades improve in school. He attends Mary Jane's play. However, she tells him that she has already been engaged to John Jameson. John is the son of his boss at the Daily Bugle.\nDoc Ock later, after finishing the machine, wants some more tritium to power it.. He wants to build rebuild his reactor to be even larger than before. He forces Harry to give it to him by threatening to kill him. Harry says he will give him the tritium as long as he brings Spider-Man to him. Doc Ock kidnaps Mary Jane, forcing Peter to put his suit again. A fight breaks out. Finally, Doc Ock puts a subway on course to crash. Spider-Man manages to stop the train with great effort. but becomes very weak and is captured and tied up and brought to Harry. Harry takes out a knife to kill him, but is shocked and stops when he pulls off Spider-Man's mask to reveal that his friend Peter is underneath the mask. Peter forces Harry to tell him where Doc Ock is, and then goes down there to save Mary Jane and the city.\nDown at the river, Doc Ock has rebuilt his reactor, this one much larger than before. Peter stuns him with an electric shock, reveals who he is, and convinces him to not do it, and Doc Ock has a change of heart. He says that the reactor is so big that only a river can contain it and uses his mechanical arms to destroy the floor underneath and dies in the process. Peter reveals his secret identity to Mary Jane but says they cannot be together because Spider-Man's enemies will target her.\nAt the end of the movie, Peter sits in his apartment and is very unhappy. The wedding for Mary Jane Watson is about to take place, but at the last minute she cancels and runs to the apartment. There, she tells him that she is willing to take the risk of being Spider-Man's girlfriend. A fire truck siren roars past. She says, \"Go get them, tiger\" and watches as Spider-Man goes out on another rescue mission."}

It was published in 1870. It is the story of Captain Nemo and his submarine \"Nautilus\". The book depicts the latest technology, and more advanced things that had not yet been invented.\nPlot.\nThe story starts in 1866. All over the world, people on ships see something strange in the sea. The strange thing is long and thin, and sometimes it glows in the water. It is much bigger and faster than a whale. Some people think it is a moving reef. Others say it could be a sea serpent.\nThe next year, in 1867, the strange thing attacks two ships. People become scared that the strange thing will attack other ships, so the United States government sends an expedition to look for the thing and find out what it is. The expedition group includes a French professor named Pierre Arronax. He thinks the strange thing might be a giant narwhal. Arronax's servant Conseil goes with him. A Canadian harpooner named Ned Land is also in the group.\nThe expedition sets sail on a ship, the \"Abraham Lincoln\" (named after Abraham Lincoln). After looking for some time, the expedition sees the strange thing. The thing attacks the \"Abraham Lincoln\". Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land fall into the sea. They swim to the strange thing and climb onto it. They find that it is not a sea animal at all; it is a submarine, the \"Nautilus\". (The submarine is named after the nautilus, a sea creature that can rise and sink to different levels in the sea, just like a submarine).\nArronax, Conseil, and Ned Land meet the owner of the submarine, who calls himself Captain Nemo (\"Nemo\" is the Latin word for \"nobody\"). Nemo tells them that they will be prisoners on the submarine for the rest of their lives, because if he let them escape from the submarine, they would tell everybody about him. Ned Land is very angry to be a prisoner, and he starts making up plans to escape. Arronax is angry at first, but soon he finds that living in a submarine is fun; he is an expert on sea animals, and now he can look at them in their own habitat. As for Conseil, he just likes being a helpful servant, so he is happy as long as Arronax is happy.\nNemo takes his prisoners on a trip around the world, going through all of the world's oceans. They travel 43,200 miles, or 20,000 leagues (that is why the book is called \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\"). They have many adventures. But then Arronax discovers that Captain Nemo attacks some ships on purpose, to try to sink them. Nemo is trying to get revenge on a country that killed his family. But he will not say which country it is, or even where he came from.\nFinally, the \"Nautilus\" gets stuck in the Maelstrom, a giant whirlpool in the Atlantic Ocean. Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land finally escape and make it back to dry land. Arronax wonders whether Captain Nemo got out of the Maelstrom safely. He also wonders whether he will ever learn what Nemo's real name is, or where he came from. Most of all, Arronax hopes that Nemo will forgive his enemies and become a peaceful man, studying all the wonderful things under the sea. The story ends\nPublication.\nPierre-Jules Hetzel published the novel in a magazine he owned, the \"Magazine of Education and Recreation\" (). The story was serialized in issues of the magazine, beginning in March 1869 and ending in June 1870. After that, in 1871, Hetzel published it as a book, with more than a hundred illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and \u00c9douard Riou."}

They are small, burrowing rodents which live in short-grass prairies and the high plains of western North America. The explorers Lewis and Clark sent a prairie dog to President Thomas Jefferson during their expedition; it was quite strange to him.\nPrairie dogs are found in North America. In Mexico, they are mostly found in the northern states, which are the southern end of the great plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and northern Tamaulipas; in the U.S., they range primarily west of the Mississippi River, though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. They are also found in the Canadian Prairies. They will eat all sorts of vegetables and fruits.\nDiet.\nPrairie dogs are mostly herbivores (plant-eaters). They eat grasses, seeds, leaves, flowers, fruit, eggs, and some insects.\nBiology and behavior.\nHighly social, prairie dogs live in large colonies \u2013 collections of prairie dog families that can span hundreds of acres. Families usually are made up of one male and two to four females living in a strict social hierarchy. Prairie dog pups reach sexual maturity at about 3\u00a0years of age, and after their third winter the dominant male in a given family will drive them away, forcing them to establish their own families on the edges of the colony. The dominant male will defend the family's borders against rival prairie dogs, and disputes are resolved by fighting. Prairie dogs are also aggressive against predators such as badgers and snakes. \nPrairie dogs are social animals, and often make social visits with each other, and greet each other with a sort of kiss. Prairie dogs employ a complex form of communication that involves barks and rhythmic chirps.\nPrairie dog tunnel systems usually have several rooms. Tunnels can go down as far as , and can extend laterally as much as . Prairie dogs line their burrows with grass to insulate them, and the earth excavated from the burrow is piled up in mounds around the burrow's entrance. The prairie dogs use these carefully maintained mounds as observation posts.\nThe prairie dog is well adapted to predators. They can detect predators from a far distance and alert other prairie dogs to the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Prairie dogs use different calls to identify specific predators. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators. Their burrows generally contain several routes of escape.\nThe prairie dog is chiefly herbivorous, though it eats some insects. It feeds primarily on grasses and, in the fall, broadleaf plants. Prairie dogs have 1-6 pups (babies) yearly, which are born blind and furless and need about 30\u00a0days of close nurturing from their mother.\nSometimes two prairie dogs touch teeth with each other. Researchers think they do this as a way of recognizing each other.\nPredators.\nPrairie dogs are hunted by many animals, including wolves, dogs, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, and humans."}

He was a leading painter who helped to create the Impressionist style. He painted portraits, and still life, but above all, he painted social scenes of the day. \nAs a painter of women, it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau\".\nYouth.\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, the child of a working class family. As a boy, he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china. He also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school. During those early years, he often visited the Louvre to study the French master painters.\nMaturity.\nIn the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water \"en plein air\" (in the open air), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect today known as diffuse reflection. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet, working side-by-side, depicted the same scenes (\"La Grenouill\u00e8re\", 1869). \nRenoir experienced his initial acclaim when six of his paintings hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. In the same year, two of his works were shown with Paul Durand-Ruel in London.\nOne of the best known Impressionist works is Renoir's 1876 Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (\"Bal du moulin de la Galette\"). The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people, at a popular dance garden on the \"Butte Montmartre\", close to where he lived.\nThe works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling colour and light.\nA trip to Italy in 1881, when he saw works by Raphael and other Renaissance masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path. For the next several years he painted in a more severe, classical, style. After 1890, however, he changed direction again, returning to thinly brushed colour to dissolve outlines as in his earlier work. From this period onward he concentrated on nudes and domestic scenes.\nA prolific artist, he made several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir's style made his paintings some of the most well-known and reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works\u2014181 paintings in all\u2014is at the Barnes Foundation, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \nIn 1890, he married Aline Victorine Charigot. She, with a number of the artist's friends, had been a model for \"Le D\u00e9jeuner des canotiers\" (Luncheon of the Boating Party, 1881). They already had a child, Pierre, in 1885. After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life, including their children and their nurse, Aline's cousin. The Renoirs had three sons, one of whom, Jean, became a film director of note and another, Pierre, became a stage and film actor.\nOld age.\nAround 1892, Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of \"Les Collettes,\" a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life, even when arthritis severely limited his movement, and he was wheelchair-bound. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to adapt his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.\nDuring this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to help him paint large works.\nIn 1919, Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with the old masters. He died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, on 3 December."}

It moved onto the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land.\nIn North Carolina, the storm surge from Isabel washed away part of Hatteras Island. This area of washed away land was sometimes known as Isabel Inlet. Damage was highest along the Outer Banks, where thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. The worst effects happened in Virginia, especially in the Hampton Roads area and on the shores of the James River. Virginia had the most deaths and damage from the hurricane.

Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\nIn contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on color and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modeled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the \"forces of the sublime\", of nature in often violent action.\nHowever, Delacroix was given neither to sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, \"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\"\nDelacroix was a member of the Club des Hashischins, or Hashish Club.

This process is termed: multiplexing.\nAn electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one expensive device or other resource, for example one A/D converter or one communication line, instead of having one device per input signal. \nAn analog multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output.\nA digital multiplexer is a set of parallel switches, with selector that selects one of the input digital channels to outputs into the single digital output channel. The selector selects one of the input channels according to the digital command (number) it receives.\nIn electronics, a demultiplexer (or demux) is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data-output-lines, which is connected to the single input. A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end. \nAn electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple-input, single-output switch, and a demultiplexer as a single-input, multiple-output switch. \nIn telecommunications and signal processing, a multiplexer is a device that combines several input information signals into one output signal, which carries several communication channels, by means of some multiplex technique. A demultiplexer is in this context a device that takes a single input signal that carries many channels and separates the channels over multiple output signals.\nOne cost-saving use for multiplexers is connecting a multiplexer and a demultiplexer (or demux) together (called mul-dex) over a single communication channel (by connecting the multiplexer's single output to the demultiplexer's single input). The image to the right demonstrates this.\nIn this case, the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is more expensive than the cost of implementing the multiplexing/demultiplexing functions.\nAt the receiving end of the data link a complementary \"demultiplexer\" is normally required to break single data stream back down into the original streams.\nIn some cases, the far end system may have more functionality than a simple demultiplexer and so, at the same time as the demultiplexing still exists logically, it may never actually happen physically, such as in network address translation where a number of IP private network users are multiplexed over a single public IP address.\nReferences.\nM.

Groups that believe in Hindutva include the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Sangh Parivar. Hindutva considers Hinduism better than other religions and cultures. Because of this, some people describe Hindutva as almost fascist, while others say that Hindutva is conservative.\nComments by scholars.\nAccording to Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist specializing in South Asia, the Hindutva ideology has roots in an era where the fiction in ancient Indian mythology and the Vedics was thought to be valid. This fiction was used to \"give sustenance to Hindu ethnic consciousness\". Its strategy emulated the Muslim identity politics of the Khilafat movement after World War I, and borrowed political concepts from the West \u2013\u00a0mainly Germany.\nAccording to Anthony Parel, a historian and political scientist, V. D. Savarkar's \"Hindutva, Who is a Hindu?\" (1923) is a fundamental text of Hindutva ideology. He comments on Savarkar's summary of Hindu culture \"as a self-sufficient culture, not needing any input from other cultures\" by saying that this is \"an unhistorical, narcissistic and false account of India's past\".\nChakravarthi Ram-Prasad, a Fellow of the British Academy and a scholar of Politics and Philosophy of Religion, says that Hindutva is a form of nationalism that is seen differently by its opponents and its supporters. The Hindutva ideology according to Savarkar, states Ram-Prasad, is based on \"geography, race, and culture\"."}

( Alternatively, Variable Length Instruction Word or VLIW a refers to a CPU instruction ( instruction set ) designed to load ( or copy ) a literal value count of inline Machine code to the on-chip RAM for higher speed CPU decoding. )\nA processor that executes every instruction one after the other (i.e. a non-pipelined scalar architecture) may use processor resources inefficiently, leading to poor performance. \nThe performance can be improved by using micro-architectural design techniques that use ILP including:\nAll above ILP techniques are implemented at a higher cost with increased hardware complexity. Before executing any operations in-parallel, the processor must verify that the instructions do not have interdependencies. There are many types of interdependencies, but a simple example would be a program in which the first instruction's result is used as an input for the second instruction. They clearly cannot execute at the same time, and the second instruction cannot be executed before the first. Modern out-of-order processors use major resources in order to take advantage of these techniques, since the scheduling of instructions must be determined dynamically as a program executes based on dependencies.\nThe VLIW approach, on the other hand, executes operation in parallel based on a fixed schedule determined when programs are compiled. Since determining the order of execution of operations (including which operations can execute simultaneously) is handled by the compiler, the processor does not need the complex hardware required by ILP techniques described above. As a result, VLIW CPUs offer significant computational power with less hardware complexity but with greater compiler design complexity.\nThe VLIW approach is a concept which is only useful as the code generated by a compiler makes it, but with a number of special-purpose instructions available to simplify certain complicated operations:"}

Below his gaping anus, his dangling penis and scrotum were visible, as well as a ring on the ring finger of his left hand.\nThe image hello.jpg comes from a set of forty pictures from a file named gap.zip. In those images, the man used sex toys and butt plugs to stretch his anus. The images were located by \"Stile Project\" and are also available from the \"Contrib\" section of the goatse.cx website under the filename gap.zip. hello.jpg is the third file in the archive, gap3.jpg.\nSite suspension.\nOn January 14, 2004, the domain \"goatse.cx\" was closed for a time. by Christmas Island Internet Administration for policy violations in response to a complaint, but many mirrors of the site are still available, and the picture is displayed on many websites.\nIn January 2007, Christmas Island Internet Administration put the domain goatse.cx back into the pool of available domains. The domain was then registered on January 16 through domain registrar Variomedia, and the current holder tried to auction off the right to use the domain.\nThe goatse.cx domain name was reported sold at an auction on April 30, 2007 to an unknown bidder. According to seobidding.com, the first auction ended with fake bids so the auction was reactivated. This was again won by fake bidders, so Seobidding.com announced that the website would be sold for $500,000 and that legal action would be pursued against the fake bidders. On November 25, 2007, the site was for sale on seobidding; \"goatse.cx asking: $50200 minimum.\"\nControl of the domain was moved to the another market, and was taken by domain squatters who were trying to sell the domain name for 10,000 euros.\nRe-launch.\nOn July 4, 2008, the site was open again, with a picture of Bill O'Reilly and a legal notice.

The Hick.org domain was registered by Matt Miller in Overland Park, Kansas. Both Goatse.cx and Hick.org originated from the same IP address; the server was in Kansas City, Missouri, metro-region. Goat.cx, formerly a mirror of Goatse.cx, was in the Dallas, Texas, metro-region, while current mirror Goatse.ru is in Russia.\nGoatse in popular culture.\nMany Internet users have been tricked into looking at the site at one time or another, it has become something of an Internet meme. As such, hello.jpg and the other images on the site are common subjects of parodies and tributes.\nAfter Hurricane Charley in August 2004, an image purporting to show \"the hands of God\" in the cloud formations in the aftermath of the disaster circulated in email. The image was proven to be a false Goatse parody.\nIn June 2007, a parody of the 2012 Summer Olympics logo sent by \"Sean Stayte\" appeared on the BBC News website under the alternative Olympic Logo entries and was broadcast on their BBC News 24 channel. Two hands were pulling the 0 from 2012 apart. The image was later shown as part of a gallery of viewers logos on BBC London News and BBC News 24, and was subsequently removed from the website.

Excessive modesty is sometimes called prudery.\nModesty usually includes:\nDifferent fashion trends test the levels of modesty. People are usually also subjected to peer pressure.\nDifferent levels of modesty apply in different situations, and to different groups of people.\nModesty does not apply in an emergency situation.\nModesty is a social norm, it does not apply where it cannot, such as in an emergency. In the case of an emergency it is more important that doctors treat those that are wounded. It does not matter that doctors may see those people naked. In some cases, it may be necessary that they take off all the clothes, to be able to treat them better.\nSome people still insist on maintaining their standards of modesty, even in an emergency situation.\nDifferent levels of modesty for different groups of people.\nModesty usually says that the parts of the human body that do not need to be exposed should not be. Usually, this applies to bare skin, hair, undergarments, and especially to intimate parts. Sometimes, the standards do not only say that the respective part should be hidden, but also that special clothing should hide its shape, what it looks like. Certain standards say how the changing of clothes should be done, like using a towel on a beach or closing (and locking) a door of a cabin that is provided.\nDifferent cultures have different standards of modesty. But standards are also different according to who the other people are, that could possibly see one's body:\nSocial standing or class can also matter. That way, different rules can apply to people of the same social class than to those of other (or lower) social classes.\nOther things that influence these norms include:\nThat way, a teacher that would perform at a night club might be seen as \"bringing the profession into disresapect\". Some people say this kind of modesty is \"body shame\".\nToo much modesty is called prudishness. As a medical condition it is also called gymnophobia. Excessive \"immodesty\" is called exhibitionism. Proponents of modesty often see it as respect for their bodies and the feelings of themselves and others, and some people believe it may reduce sexual crimes. Critics argue that it's not healthy to have a negative attitude toward the human body. Some assert that there may be a correlation between repressive body attitudes and undesirable outcomes such as sexual crimes, violence, and stress.\nDifferent cultures have different views.\nThe cultural and religious background heavily influence the views a person has on modesty.\nGenerally accepted western norms.\nWhat is called Western culture expects that Intimate body parts are covered in public places at all times. There are exceptions for places where people change clothes, as these are usually differentiated by sex. This means there is one changing-room for men, and another for women. Other exceptions include saunas, which tend to be mixed-sex (there is one sauna for both men and women) places.\nSpecial rules also apply for places where bathing is common. It might be tolerated that a woman is topless on a beach, or near a pool. If there is a restaurant near the beach or pool, it is usual, that the woman can be topless on the beach, but if she wants to eat something in the restaurant, that she has to cover her breasts. Very often, such restaurants are visually segregated by a railing. On one side of the railing there is the beach, on the other, there is the restaurant.\nThere are more and more beaches in cities. This blurs the boundary even more. There may be people in swimsuits next to businesspeople in a suit.\nIn private homes, the rules may be more relaxed. Nudity among close family members in the home is sometimes permitted, especially in the bedroom and bathroom. Wearing undergarments casually may be permitted as well. Elsewhere in the home, family members may be expected to wear more clothes, casually, especially if guests are present. A bathrobe may fulfill the purpose here.\nNaturism.\nNaturists have different views. They want to create an environment, were people can feel at ease, even when they are nude, they can be seen nude, or nude people are among them. These values conflict with the current standards of modesty. For this reason, nudists mostly reject the current standards of modesty.\nIndigenous tribes.\nTraditional indigenous cultures such as those in Africa, or the aborigines in Australia have social norms that vary greatly. How much exposure is acceptable varies from nothing for some women, to everything except the glans penis for some men of certain tribes. Certain African cultures think body painting is body coverage. Many think it is an \"attire\".\nDifferent standards for men and women.\nThere are different standards of modesty for men and women. Western culture expects that both men and women keep their genitals covered. It also expects that women keep their breasts covered, most of the time. There may be exceptions for bathing, or breastfeeding.\nShowing naked soldiers bathing became common during the Second World War. Boys in high-school age also swam in the nude, during that time.\nFashion as well as other social norms expect that men cover more body parts than women, such as the midriff and the upper part of the back.\nSwimming pants are often larger for men than for women. Before the 1930s, men were generally prohibited from baring their chests in public, even at beaches. Organizations such as the Topfree Equal Rights Association advocate for gender equality in this regard. In 1992, New York State's highest court accepted 14th Amendment arguments and struck down the provision in New York's \"Exposure of the Person\" statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so.\nSexual orientation is a subject that is less and less a taboo. Homosexuality also seems to be more common or more talked about. This has led to stricter levels of modesty in same-sex situations, such as in changing-rooms. In several places, community showers have been converted to single showers, with curtains or doors. Many students no longer shower after exercise. Research has shown a dramatic decline in same-sex sexual activity among adolescent males that correlates with the increasing social visibility of gays and the increasing level of modesty. Related factors are the increasing emphasis on ideal male physiques shown by advertisements and the concern over being photographed and videotaped.\nWhat religious communities think.\nIslam.\nIslamic society thinks modesty is important, but there are different interpretations of what dress should be considered modest. Many Muslim women wear a headscarf (hijab) as a sign of modesty. More conservative societies expect that women cover their whole body, except for their hands and their face.\nA woman who choses to also cover her face and hands is said to be expressing greater \"modesty and holiness\". In some Islamic societies, women wear the niqab, an all-encompassing garment intended to conceal every part of the body, sometimes including the eyes. Wearing a niqab (sometimes referred to as a burqa, although this term only technically applies to an Afghan all-in-one garment) is common in some countries with a majority Muslim population.\nIn most Muslim countries a woman can chose how to express her modesty. More conservative countries such as Afghanistan or Iran do have laws that say what kind of dress a woman should wear. Not obeying these laws can lead to harsh punishments.\nLikewise, according to some Islamic interpretations of Hadith, men are required to cover everything from 'navel to knee'; with some men choosing to extend this to the traditional Islamic head covering taqiyah (cap), the male counterpart to hijab which closely resembles the Jewish yarmulke but is slightly larger in size. The taqiyah cap may vary in shape, size or color just as the hijab does, with many regional differences according to tradition and personal taste.\nA burqini is a swimsuit designed for Muslim women that covers the whole body except the face, the hands and the feet, that enables them to satisfy the requirements of Muslim standards of modesty while enabling them to take part in swimming activities.\nJudaism.\nModesty is also important in Judaism, especially in the case of women. An ultra-orthodox Hasidic married woman is expected by their community to cover her hair in public, and sometimes at home. The hair covering may be a scarf, hat, snood, or a wig (\"sheitel\"). Some communities have stricter standards and expect women to cover their elbows and legs, with blouses covering the collarbone and sleeves covering elbows. Skirts are expected to cover the knees. All slits in skirts are expected to be closed. See-through materials may not be used and clothes are expected not to be tight-fitting, provocative, loud in color, or display texts. Some communities apply these standards to girls as young as three. Modern Orthodox women will usually wear a kerchief or a hat to cover the top of their head, exposing lower hair.\nNon-orthodox Jewish women tend to adopt the fashions of the non-Jewish society in which they live.\nCatholic Christianity.\nCatholics are expected to dress modestly, but there are no \"official guidelines\". Form time to time, priests and popes have given their opinion. These opinions are not binding, nevertheless many Catholics find them useful.\nPope Pius XII stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders, that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee, and the neckline should not reveal anything. Another example is Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa, who stated that trousers were unacceptable dress for women. Many tradition-minded Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard.\nSome Catholics have attempted to make theories of modesty. Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective, while at other times it takes a more systematic, Thomistic approach, combined with the writings of the Church Fathers. Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities, such as the saints, can also be found.\nThe Church also expects men to dress modestly, but the demands are not as strict for them as for women; this is largely because men are often thought to be more inherently susceptible to sexual thoughts."}

They have stocky legs at each corner of their muscular body, so when they walk, they take short steps and swing their body from side to side. \nTheir fur comes in many colors, including light brown, white, black or mixed (brindle).

{"id": "140697", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140697", "title": "Child pornography", "text": "Child pornography is pornography that exploits children. It is against the law in many countries. Child pornography is made by taking pictures or videos, or more rarely sound recordings, of children who are wearing less clothing than usual, wearing no clothing, or being raped. It can also be made using illustrations of children. Child pornography is sometimes called \"child sexual abuse images\" because it is images (pictures) of a child who is being sexually abused. Child pornography can be made by setting up a camera or other recording device and molesting a child. \nChild pornography can also be drawn, written, or created by a computer. In that case, it is called \"simulated child pornography\", \"virtual child pornography\", \"non-photographic child pornography\", or \"pseudo-photographic child pornography\": the child in the pornography is simulated, virtual, or drawn, meaning the child is not real. \nThere are several possible reasons for a person to look at child pornography. The most common is that the viewer is a pedophile, hebephile, or ephebophile who finds minors sexually attractive and uses pornography featuring minors to induce arousal. Viewers may be curious about the subject. Or a person who plans to commit statutory rape may plan to show the pornography to a minor as a form of grooming to convince the minor that minors having sex with adults is normal. Mexico is the largest distributor of child pornography in the world.\nLaws about child pornography.\nBetween 2016 and 2018, many countries made their child pornography laws more similar, which let police from different countries work together more easily. In particular, the word \"child\" in the new child pornography laws is used as a synonym for legal minors under the age of 18. This can be confusing because \"child\" usually means a person who has not yet reached puberty. However, in 2007, the United States already had laws forbidding pornography with models under 18, and most people who were arrested for owning child pornography around that time had images of children who have not started puberty. \nSome countries consider virtual or non-photographic child pornography which depict children who are not real to be a type of child porn that is illegal, whereas other countries do not consider this type of child porn illegal. Making this type of child porn illegal has been controversial. This is due to multiple reasons: due to the opinion that it is pointless to protect children who are not real, the opinion that such laws remove people of their rights, a fear that these laws can cover harmless material, and the fear that it is possible to exploit such laws to charge harmless individuals with heavily disproportionate charges. Another criticism that is often given to the illegal nature of pornographic depiction of fictional children is the assertion that removing a potential a paedophile's ability to access an alternative to the \"real thing\" will encourage them abuse real children. Research on whether this is true or not has produced mixed results. \nIn England due to a 2009 act, basically all non-photographic child pornography is illegal, even if it is something unrealistic, such as an anime drawing. However, charges for unrealistic non-photographic child porn possession or creation which do not involve real children tend to get dismissed by judges at trials and are not treated overly seriously. \nThe Internet is a common place for people to share child pornography, especially on the dark web. When police officers find child pornography on the Internet, it is difficult for them to track down the molester and the other people who have looked at the recording.\nAbuse and harm caused to the child.\nChild molestation is when an adult touches a child in the genital area (between the legs), buttocks, or breasts, or a child is made to touch an adult in those areas. An adult touching any part of a child's body without consent (permission) from the child is also sometimes called molestation. Molestation is very harmful to children and can traumatize them for years or for the rest of their lives. An adult recording an instance of molestation as child pornography also harms the child. This harm from the recording is added to the harm from the molestation itself. Knowing that the molestation was recorded can slow down the child's healing from the abuse. The adult who has the recording can sell the recording, or threaten to share it with other adults to scare the child in the recording and make them obey the adult."}

{"id": "140701", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140701", "title": "Child prostitution", "text": "Child prostitution is prostitution involving children. They are children who get paid for sex acts. Sometimes, the children do not get paid with money, but they are given other things in exchange for having sex such as toys. Sometimes, the child isn't paid with anything at all and is being forced to be a prostitute by an abuser. The meaning of \"child prostitute\" varies. In most cases, it is not the child who makes money from the prostitution, but another person. This is either a pimp, or someone who directly abuses the child. This person will make a deal directly with the child to get sexual gratification. Different people may also exchange children to have sex with. \nThe Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (Convention No 182) of the International Labour Organization (ILO) provides that the \"use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution\" is one of the \"worst forms of child labor\". This convention from 1999, provides that countries that have signed it must get rid of child prostitution s soon as possible. It has the fastest pace of ratifications in the ILO's history since 1919.\nThe prostitution of children is seen as part of the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and is sometimes connected to the trafficking of children for sexual purposes, and to child pornography. Child sex tourism also falls within the category of the prostitution of children.\nHow many there are.\nIn 1992, researcher and expert Ron O'Grady estimated the number of child prostitutes to be 1 million.\nIn 2001, Dr. Richard Estes and Dr. Neil Alan Weiner estimated that in the U.S., 162,000 U.S. homeless youth are victims of commercial sexual exploitation (CVE) and that 57,800 children in homes (including public housing) are estimated to be victims of CVE. They also estimated that 30% of shelter youth and 70% of homeless youth are victims of CVE in the United States.\nOne third of street-level prostitutes in the U.S. are less 18 years old while fifty percent of off-street prostitutes are less than 18 years old. Off-street prostitution includes massage parlors, strip clubs, and escort services. According to Estes and Weiner, 12 to 14 is the average age of entry into prostitution for girls under 17 years old in the United States while the average age of entry into prostitution is between 11 and 13.\nIn Ukraine, a survey conducted by the group \u201cLa Strada-Ukraine\u201d in 2001-2003, based on a sample of 106 women being 'trafficked' out of Ukraine found that 3% were under 18, and the US State Department reported in 2004 that incidents of minors being trafficked was increasing. \nIn Thailand, NGOs have estimated that up to a third of prostitutes are children under 18. A study by the International Labor Organization on child prostitution in Vietnam reported that incidence of children in\nprostitution is steadily increasing and children under 18 make up between 5 percent and 20 percent of prostitution depending on the geographical area.\nIn the Philippines, UNICEF estimated that there are 60,000 child prostitutes and many of the 200 brothels in the notorious Angeles City offer children for sex.\nECPAT New Zealand and Stop Demand Foundation have cited in a report \u201cThe Nature and Extent of the Sex Industry in New Zealand,\u201d a police survey of the New Zealand sex industry that 210 children under the age of 18 years were identified as selling sex, with three-quarters being concentrated in one Police District.\nThe 1996 report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography estimates that about one million children in Asia alone are victims of the sex trade. According to the International Labor Organization, the problem is especially alarming in Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia and Nepal.\nA 2006 report by World Vision Middle East/Eastern Europe funded by the Canadian government and supported by six United Nations agencies and the International Organization for Migration reported that the sexual exploitation of children, child trafficking and sexual violence towards minors is increasing and that Russia is becoming a new destination for child sex tourism. The report adds that some studies claim approximately 20 to 25 percent of Moscow's sex workers are minors.\nIn Africa and South Asia, many countries are faced with a rising child prostitution rate and the linkage with tourism is evident. Child prostitution and the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation is also increasing in Europe, North America, and Australia.\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the City Social Assistance Secretary estimates that there are 223 child prostitutes, both boys and girls. Some are transvestites. The transactions are intermediated by pimps. They charge from 2 reals (US$ 0,36 in 09/29/2020) to 30 reals (US$ %,34 in 09/29/2020). The children are between 10 and 17 years old. In some cases, the families are involved in the prostitution."}

When an adult becomes friends with a child, this is sometimes done for a reason. The reason is to lower the inhibitions of the child and to prepare for sexual abuse. So, action taken by an adult to form a trusting relationship with a child, with the intent of later having sexual contact, is 'child grooming'.\nThe act of grooming a child may include activities that are legal, but later lead to sexual contact. The grooming is done to gain the child's trust, and the trust of those responsible for the child. Children are less likely to report a crime if it involves someone the child knows, trusts, and cares about. Also, a relationship with the family means the child's parents will be less likely to believe any accusations.\nExamples of grooming.\nChild grooming on the internet.\nSexual grooming of children also occurs on the internet. Some abusers pose as children online and make arrangements to meet with them in person.\nIn 2003, MSN implemented restrictions in their chat rooms purportedly intended to help protect children from adults seeking sexual conversations with them. In 2005, Yahoo! chat rooms were investigated by the New York State attorney general's office for allowing users to create rooms whose names suggested that they were being used for this purpose. That October, Yahoo! agreed to \"implement policies and procedures designed to ensure\" that such rooms would not be allowed.\nAn organization called Perverted-Justice (known as PJ) uses PJ operatives posing as underage teens on the internet to identify potential child molesters and turn the information over to the police and the courts. The news program \"Dateline NBC\" features the recurring segment \"To Catch a Predator\", based on documenting such activities.\nAn organization called Crisp Thinking has created an expert service providing social platforms and apps with the risk protection they need to protect their users from sexual exploitation, child abuse images and trolls.\nAnother software company in the UK has developed a program that hold as competitor to Crisp, called Sentry Parental Controls . It was launched by television personality Coleen Nolan and is supported by Mark Williams-Thomas, a leading expert in child protection."}

Their philosophy taught that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all the usual desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, and by living a life free from all possessions. People are reasoning creatures. They could therefore gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into Stoicism.\nThe first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes, who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE. He was followed by Diogenes of Sinope, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens, took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of Imperial Rome in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the Empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although many of its ascetic and rhetorical ideas were adopted by early Christians."}

In 2007, it was the most voted place in an online election to choose the \"Seven Wonders of Brazil\". The botanical garden houses part of the campus of the Federal University of Paran\u00e1. It is the unofficial symbol of the city and of all South Brazil.\nThe international identification code is CURIT.\nHistory.\nThe first Botanical Garden in Curitiba was the Passeio P\u00fablico (\"Public Promenade Park\"), in 19th century. Inaugurated by the President of Paran\u00e1 Province Alfredo d\u2019Escragnolle Taunay, was the first public park of the city.\nName.\nThe official name - \"Jardim Bot\u00e2nico Fanchette Rischbieter\" - is a tribute to Francisca Maria (Fanchette) Garfunkel Rischbieter (1929-1989), pioneer planner in urban planning of Curitiba.\nCurrent location.\nOpened in the administration of Jewish Mayor Jaime Lerner, on October 5, 1991 on an old dump, was created in the style of French gardens. The design of flowerbeds geometrical gardens was inspired by the flag of the city, which can be clearly seen in an aerial view of the place. The greenhouses of iron and glass - the main one of them inspired in the Crystal Palace (a building that existed in London in 1851) were designed by the architect Abra\u00e3o Assad, who also planned the Botanical Museum.\nDescription.\nThe Botanical Garden of Curitiba is the most know Curitiba's picture postcard landmark and contains many Brazilian plants and from other countries, spread across boulevards and greenhouses of iron and glass - the main one of them, in an art nouveau style with a modern metallic structure, looks like the mid-19th century Crystal Palace in England. \nOnce the portal of entry, may be seen extensive gardens in the French style in the middle of fountains, waterfalls and lakes, and the main greenhouse of 458 square meters, which holds in its interior, copies plants characteristic of tropical regions. It rolls out its carpet of flowers to the visitors right at the entrance, between 6 geometric gardens (each one illuminated by chandeliers with Republican-style, each with five lanterns), each with 4 flowerbeds - totaling 24 flowerbeds - enclosed by buxaceae and adorned with seasonal flowers. This occupies 278.000 m\u00b2 in area. The principal greenhouse, with three domes, in an art nouveau style with a modern metallic structure, looks like the mid-19th century Crystal Palace in London, England. The Botanic Museum, which provides a national reference collection of native flora, attracts researchers from all over the world. It includes many botanic species from the moist Atlantic Forests of eastern Brazil. \nThe native forest have many paths for walk. Behind the greenhouse is the Museum of Franz Krajcberg , the Polish Brazilian artist who took up the cause of environmental conservation; with 1,320 square meters of area, divided into multimedia classrooms, an auditorium with 60 seats and lounge with several exhibitions of works donated by visual artist, represented by sculptures and reliefs, as well as photographs, videos, publications and educational materials.\nIn the other side is the Botanical Museum, a wooden building which entrance using a bridge made of wood also. Actually, the Botanical Museum of Curitiba has the fourth largest herbarium in the country. In front of the construction there is a pond with carp, turtles, teal, herons, etc., and offers a lake, an auditorium, a library, an expositions area and a theatre. The park also has tennis courts and a cycle track.\nPlant collections.\nMore than a postcard of the city, or a place for leisure and recreation, is a research center for the flora of Paran\u00e1, contributing to environmental education, preservation and conservation of nature.\nLike all botanical gardens, the curitiban has a great variety of plants and also has the objective of cultivate them, protect them, study them and reproduce them. \nIn 2008, another greenhouse was built to research, shelter and reproduction of Brazilian living plants - and in danger of extinction - and Brazilian native ornamental plants. In contrast to main greenhouse, this is not open to the public; it serves to scientific research and is home to rare plants to prevent disappearance of nature. It is made of polycarbonate and has internal system of irrigation and temperature control.\nIn order to appreciate the native plants, in 2007, the Garden of Native Plants of Curitiba was created; every plant in the garden is native, even the grass. Because it has no exotic plants, the garden attracts lots of butterflies and other pollinating insects\nIn the past, the Atlantic Forest was the second largest forest in Brazil; currently there is less than 5% of forest in the country.\nThis is the native vegetation of Curitiba. The araucaria moist forests are a subtropical moist forest ecoregion of southern Brazil, and is now one of the most endangered biomas of the world; corresponds to approximately 40% of the vegetation of the \"Jardim Bot\u00e2nico de Curitiba\". The park was created in order to protect this biodiversity.\nNext to one of the lakes, 200 seedlings of trees and shrubs native of the Serra do Mar of Paran\u00e1 were planted; the Mountain Range of the Sea () is a 1,500\u00a0km long system of mountain ranges and escarpments in Southeastern Brazil, which runs in parallel to the Atlantic Ocean coast. Some planted species were cultivated on the coast of Paran\u00e1 and then transplanted into the garden of plants of the Serra do Mar.\nEvery year, in July, the prunus serrulata blossoms; there are about 30 trees, planted in a path that connects the parking to the portal of entrance of the park.\nIn the capital city of Parana, the first seedlings were taken by Japanese immigrants in the first half of the 20th century, but began to be planted in large quantities from the 1990s, with the opening of the Botanical Garden. Now the seedlings are produced by the city and used in afforestation of streets and squares.\nOpened in 2008, the \"Jardim das Sensa\u00e7\u00f5es\" is a track of 200 meters long where visitors walk blindfolded (without the vision) to know some plants and natural landscapes using the other senses. More than 70 plant species with smells, textures, shapes and sizes fill the course of the Garden. \nOccupies an area of 2381 meters square surrounded by trees that help to isolate external noise and, to guarantee the surprise, it is hidden by a fence of bamboo. All elements of the track are identified in Braille, the language made with points in high relief used by blind persons. The space is free and monitored, where small groups are organized to make the experience (that can walk the path with or without the blindfold). Receives approximately 5,000 visitors per week.\nThe Botanical Museum of Curitiba.\nThe Museu Bot\u00e2nico de Curitiba (\"Botanical Museum of Curitiba\") is inside the Botanical Garden of the city; has ample space for exhibitions, library and auditorium. Was founded in 1965, when the botanical Gerdt G\u00fcnther Hatschbach donated his private collection to the municipality of Curitiba. Today, the collection is the fourth largest in Brazil, with more than 333,000 specimens.\nThe Museum has developed an exchange program for botanical material, and exchanges material with 207 institutions worldwide (53 in Brazil, 154 in other places). Due to this program, around 90% of the collection has been identified by specialists; it makes the Botanical Museum of Curitiba an international reference for botanical material - receives annually an average of 400 research scientist visitors, and includes specialists and graduate students.\nEach year, the collection increases by approximately 15,000 specimens.\nCulture and arts.\nSculptures.\nAmor Materno (\"Maternal Love\") - Sculpture of Polish artist Jo\u00e3o Zaco Paran\u00e1 (stage name of Jan \u017bak) (1884-1961), cast in bronze and placed in a fountain. This sculpture was made in 1907 (in the same year, the Polish-Brazilian artist won the special prize of the \"Hall of Fine Arts in Brussels\"), and was donated by the Polish colony of Brazil to honor all paranaense mothers in the celebration of 300th anniversary of the city in 1993.\nZaco Paran\u00e1 immigrated with his parents to Brazil in 1896; was the author of many monuments, statues, sculptures, etc. in several Brazilian states and around the world.\nTorso do Trabalhador (\"Worker's Trunk\") - Sculpture of paranaense artist Erbo Stenzel (1911-1980), cast in bronze and placed inside the glasshouse, in a fountain. This sculpture was made in 1941 and was placed in 1994 to honor all the workers of the world, when Curitiba hosted the \"World Habitat Day\" in 1995 - an event celebrated by UN to make reflection on the situation of cities and the human right to adequate housing, as well remind the world of its collective responsibility for the habitat for future generations.\nErbo Stenzel was born in Parana State, descendant of Germans and Austrians; held many monuments and sculptures of political personalities of the state and about local culture.\nEspa\u00e7o Cultural Frans Krajcberg.\nThe \"Frans Krajcberg Cultural Space\" is behind the main greenhouse. Originally opened to be a orchidary, received the artworks in 2003, including 110 large sculptures (all made from the remains of burned or illegally cut down trees), reliefs, photographs, videos and texts. The name \"The Revolt\" expresses the artist's feeling about the complete destruction caused by man in the Brazilian forests. There is also an exhibit of photos taken by the sculptor and selling books related to the artist. The main purpose of the space is, according to Krajcberg, environmental awareness. All works were donated by the artist.\nKrajcberg was born in 1921, in Poland. Son of a Jewish family who disappeared in 1945 (in the Holocaust), left for Brazil in 1948 and became a naturalized Brazilian years later. Received many awards around the world, and other \"Frans Krajcberg Cultural Space\" - but in Paris. But in Curitiba Botanic Garden was the first place in the world that was specifically designed to house his works. The gallery receives about 60,000 visitors each year.\nIconic use.\nThe new Botanical Garden was part of many other creations of Mayor Jaime Lerner, who at time had created the slogan for the city \"The Ecological Capital of Brazil\". It quickly became an icon of the city, and the image of the main greenhouse is the most landmark used in advertising about the city, becoming the unofficial symbol of Curitiba and of all the South region of Brazil.\nThe city of Conc\u00f3rdia, in Santa Catarina state, built a mall inspired in the greenhouse of the Botanical Garden; another construction evidently inspired is the Shopping P\u00e1tio Higien\u00f3polis, in S\u00e3o Paulo City. The logo for the candidacy of Curitiba as the host city of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil was also inspired in the park's glasshouse.\nThematic lighting.\nAs the best known place in the city, the image of greenhouse is used from many manifestations: since 2008, the park lights are turned off by one hour as a way to join the Earth Hour (an global event organized by World Wide Fund for Nature - WWF - held on the last Saturday of March annually); every year, in October, the greenhouse is illuminated with pink, to support the \"Breast Cancer Awareness Month\"; in December, an Christmas decoration is made, as part of the \"Christmas of Light\". And a thousand days to the World Cup in Brazil (2014), between 16 and 23 September 2011 was made an tribute with the light colors of the flags of each country that has won the championship: Brazil, Italy, Germany, Uruguay, Argentina, England, France and Spain. At the same year Curitiba became part of the cities engaged in the \"Decade of Action for Road Safety\", by United Nations; the yellow color, that in traffic means \"attention\", lighted the greenhouse.\nSports and leisure.\nThe park has Wi-Fi at many places. To access the network of free wireless internet is necessary first register on the site of Passport Curitiba.\nThe Curitiba Velodrome.\nThe Irineu Marinho Velodrome (also known as Curitiba Velodrome) was opened in 1979 and is the first Brazilian velodrome to have a public cycling school. The measurements are Olympic, with 333,33 meters long and holds national and international competitions.\nIn 1982, it was refurbished and in 2002 and underwent a major renovation. Due to the work of their coaches, became an important way to formation of many of Brazil's best cyclists, male or female, forming teams representing the state and the country to participate in national championships, international and Olympic.\nThe Velodrome Center for Sport and Leisure\nThe \"Center for Sport and Recreation\" has the velodrome cycling track, courts to beach football and sand volleyball, and three tennis courts. It offers activities guided by physical education teachers, like gymnastics, walking and cycling. In 2010, he was installed an \"outdoor gym\", and like the other things, is open to the public and completely free.\nAddress.\nOn Eng. Ostoja Roguski Street, s/n\u00b0, Jardim Bot\u00e2nico Neighborhood, Curitiba, Paran\u00e1, Brazil. Free open daily to visitors from 6 am till 9 pm during summertime and from 6 am till 8 pm during the rest of the year. Phone: +55 (41) 3362-5289."}

The area forms the border of Bangladesh with the Republic of India and Burma. It was a single district of East Pakistan till 1971. In that year it was divided into three separate districts: Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban. Topographically, this is the only hill intensive area of the People's Republic. With a population of Around 800,000 Indigenous peoples (Native (non-Bengali). The Chittagong Hill Tracts is one of the most diverse regions in the country in terms of geography, ethnicity, culture and traditions of the people. The indigenous distinct Jumma people are distinct and different from the majority Bengali people of present-day \"Bangla-desh\" in respect of race, language, culture, heritage, religion, political history and economy.\nWhen India was split into two separate countries in 1948, the Radcliffe Line gave this area to East Pakistan (Bangladesh), which was mostly Muslim, even though most people in the area were Buddhists. Today most people are Buddhist, some Christians and animists. The major ethnic groups among 13 peoples are the Chakma, Tipra, Murong and Magh, Marma, Tanchangya, Mro, Lushai, Khumi, Chak, Khiyang, Bawm, Pangkhua and with the Ten indigenous languages. Beside, a very small number of descendants of Ahamiya, Gorkha and Santal also live there. They collectively identify themselves as the Jumma people (High Landers), the first people of the CHT.but almost 50% of the present day's population are immigrated Bengali Muslim settlers. Since the Independence of Bangla-Desh the indigenous population was faced with increasing immigration of settlers from the mainland, fostered by the central nationalist government. Among the tribal nations first political and civil, later (since the 1980s) armed resistance was organised, especially by the Shanti Bahini guerrilla movement. In reaction the whole region was heavily militarised and the police and army unleashed a wide spread repression with a serious human rights violations. The 5-points-manifesto of the Jana Samhati Samiti, released on 7 September 1987, was focused on a well entrenched Autonomy:\nOn 2 December 1997 a \"Peace agreement\" was signed by the government and Parvatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti, the political platform of the indigenous peoples, granting a limited level of autonomy to three districts of CHT. The Jana Samhati Samiti transformed into a party, but this treaty has never been implemented, as it was opposed by both the opposition parties of Bangla Desh and by the majority fraction of the Shanti Bahini. The previous nationalists Bangla Desh government of Khaleda Zia promised to re-launch the peace process, but until now did not accomplish with its promises.\nHistorical Background.\nBefore the colonization, the indigenous Jumma people of CHT were independent. There had been no external interference by any outside power in the affairs of the CHT until 1787, when an agreement was signed with the British. British colonization actually started in 1860. From 1787 to 1860 the British government did not intervene in the internal administration of the CHT. After 1860 and until 1900 the British government administered CHT through a set of Rules promulgated from time to time. For the maintenance of discipline among the police personnel in the CHT, Frontier Police Regulation III of 1881 was promulgated on the 7 December 1881 and CHT Police Force was raised with indigenous Jumma people. For the good government of the CHT, in 1900 the British government enacted the CHT Regulation 1 of 1900 and declared it as an Excluded Area, in order to protect the Jumma people from economic exploitation by non-indigenous Bengali people and to preserve their traditional socio-cultural and political institutions based on customary laws, community ownership of land and so on.\nThrough the Partition of India, CHT was ceded to the Dominion of Pakistan. The Pakistani government recognized CHT as an Excluded Area and even in the first Constitution of Pakistan, which was adopted in 1956, CHT was declared as an Excluded Area under the CHT Regulation of 1900. From the very outset, the Pakistani government looked upon the Jumma people with an eye of suspicion for being anti-Pakistani as well as anti-Islamic. There was discrimination against the Jumma people in employment, business and education. The government policy was clearly revealed by the repeal of the CHT Frontier Police Regulation of 1881, thus disbanding the Jumma police force in 1948. Even in 1950, in implementing its brazen designs violating the principles and spirit of the CHT Regulation of 1900, the Government of Pakistan started Bengali Muslim settlement program, which continued up to 1966. The government had enacted the CHT (Land Acquisition) Regulation in 1958 in order to grab Jumma people\u2019s ancestral lands. Moreover, the government snatched away the rights and privileges of the Jumma people by canceling the Excluded Area status of the CHT in 1963. In 1960, in order to carry out its plan and break down the economic backbone of the Jumma people of the CHT in the name of so-called industrial development, the Pakistani government built the Kaptai hydro-electric dam on the Karnaphuli river in the heartland of the indigenous Jumma people.\nDuring the Separatists War of 1971, the then Chakma King sided with the Pakistanis, so when independence came, the Adivasis\u2019 plea for special status fell on deaf ears. The Chakma king left for Pakistan and later became that country\u2019s ambassador to Argentina.\nMeanwhile, more and more Bengalis were migrating into the area, usurping the land. In 1973 the Adivasis initiated an insurgency. To counter it, the government, in 1979, started issuing permits to landless Bengalis to settle there, with title to tribal land. This practice continued for six years and resulted in a mass migration of approximately 400,000 people into the area \u2013 almost as many as all the tribal groups combined. Countless human-rights abuses occurred as the army tried to put down the revolt.\nFrom 1973 until 1997 the Hill Tracts area was the scene of a guerrilla war between the Bangladeshi army and the Shanti Bahini rebels. The troubles stemmed from the cultural clash between the tribal groups and the plains people. After nine months of war of separatism against Pakistan, Bangladesh emerged as an independent state on 16 December 1971. The Jumma people then had hoped that the new rulers of Bangladesh would realize their hopes and aspirations. So the Jumma people demanded to the then government for regional autonomy in a democratic way. Unfortunately, the government of Bangladesh did not respect their fundamental rights and did not write even a single word in the Constitution regarding the entity and safeguard of the Jumma people. Rather, immediately following the independence of Bangladesh in early 1972 the CHT underwent militarization. When the democratic movement to safeguard the national existence of the Jumma people was negotiated by the government with repressive measures through the civil and police administrations, including through militarization with the construction of three Army cantonments, it forced Manabendra Narayan Larma, the then MP and the hero of the CHT Jumma movement, to call for an armed struggle. An armed wing of PCJSS was formed with the name of Shanti Bahini (Peace Force). Since 1979 the Government of Bangladesh has undertaken a drastic program to settle the Bengali population from other Districts of Bangladesh to CHT, so that they would outnumber the Jumma people and use them as human shields for the protection of the Army personnel. At least four hundred thousands of Bengali Muslims were transferred into the CHT and settled on Jumma people\u2019s lands.\nThe PCJSS has always kept the door open for dialogue for resolving the CHT problem through political and peaceful means. For this purpose, the PCJSS held 6 and 13 times formal dialogues with the governments of Ershad and Khaleda Zia respectively. During the last one, after holding 7 round of dialogues with Sheikh Hasina government, the 'CHT Accord' was signed between the National Committee on the CHT on behalf of the government of Bangladesh and the PCJSS on behalf of the permanent residents of the CHT in Dhaka on 2 December 1997."}

It is also a suite of free software published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that implements this protocol. Its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model, and it provides mutual authentication \u2014 both the user and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks.\nKerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the insecure network can be read, modified, and inserted. Kerberos builds on symmetric-key cryptography and requires a key distribution center. Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication.\nHistory and development.\nMIT developed Kerberos to protect network services provided by Project Athena. The protocol was named after the Greek mythological character \"Kerberos\" (or \"Cerberus\"), known in Greek mythology as being the monstrous three-headed guard dog of Hades. Several versions of the protocol exist; versions 1\u20133 used only internally at MIT.\nSteve Miller and Clifford Neuman, the primary designers of Kerberos version 4 (which used the DES encryption algorithm with 56-bit keys),\npublished that version in 1989, although they had targeted it primarily for Project Athena. \nVersion 5, designed by John Kohl and Clifford Neuman, appeared as RFC 1510 in 1993 (made obsolete by RFC 4120 in 2005), with the intention of overcoming the limitations and security problems of Version 4. The MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos Version 5 freely available, under a software license similar to that used by BSD license.\nSeveral companies used Kerberos Version 5 in commercial software including:\nIn 2005, the IETF Kerberos working group introduced a new updated specifications for Kerberos Version 5 . updates include:\nIn 2007, MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium for continuation of development.\nProtocol.\nKerberos uses as its basis the Needham-Schroeder protocol. It makes use of a trusted third party authentication known as \"key distribution center (KDC)\", which consists of two logically separate parts: an Authentication Server (AS) and a Ticket Granting Server (TGS). Kerberos works on the basis of \"tickets\" (called Kerberos tickets) which serve to prove the identity of users.\nKerberos database: The key distribution center (KDC) maintains a database of secret keys; each entity on the network \u2014 whether a client or a server \u2014 shares a secret key known only to itself and to the KDC. Knowledge of this key serves to prove the identity of each entity. For communication between two entities, the KDC generates a session key which they can use to secure their communications.\nThe term \"Kerberos server\" generally refers to the KDC. For reliability purposes, it is possible to have backup KDCs. These are referred to as \"Kerberos slave servers\". All slaves synchronize their databases from the master Kerberos server.\nThe term \"Kerberized application server\" generally refers to Kerberized programs that clients communicate with using Kerberos tickets for authentication. For example, the Kerberos telnet server is an example of a Kerberized application server . While the term \"Kerberized applications\" is used to referrer to the client side of Kerberized application server , For example, the Kerberos telnet client is an example of a Kerberized applications\nThe security of the protocol depends heavily on:\nSimplified description of the protocol.\nThe following abbreviations will be used:\nBriefly, the client authenticates to AS using a long-term \"shared secret\" and receives a ticket from the AS. Later the client can use this ticket to get additional tickets for SS using the same shared secret. These tickets can be used to prove authentication to SS.\nThe protocol in more detail.\nUser Client-based Logon Steps:\nClient Authentication Steps:\nClient Service Authorization Steps:\nClient Service Request Steps:"}

It was mainly active during the 18th and 19th centuries. Until the 18th century, few people criticized slavery. But thinkers of the Enlightenment started to criticize it, because in their opinion slavery was against human rights. Communities like the Quakers thought that slavery was contradicting with Christianity.\nThe United States.\nRace-based slavery was established in the parts of British North America, New France, and Spanish America that would become the U.S. in the 16th and 17th centuries. By the beginning of the 18th century, enslavement of black Africans was powering the economy in these areas. Most opposition to slavery was from enslaved people themselves.\nDuring the American Revolution, beginning in 1775, the Virginia Governor, Lord Dunmore promised freedom to slaves and indenture servants \"able and willing to take up arms\" with the British. This proclamation would give freedom to the indentured servants and slaves held by the rebelling colonists, and wouldn't effect the loyalists. Many of the former slaves would die of disease, in fact 8 times as many blacks died of disease than died in battle. When the war ended, most slaves who decided to fight with the British were returned to servitude. Some black Loyalists were taken to Canada and elsewhere.\nThe American Army of the revolution contained many blacks, most of them coming from New England. The most significant black regiment was the 1st Rhode Island. The Regiment was created in 1778 and consisted of mostly blacks. Upon joining the regiment, the commander, Colonel Christopher Greene, would release any slave from servitude.\nFollowing drafting, and signing of the new United States Constitution, blacks in the country were completely disenfranchised, and most remained slaves. Slavery began to decline. Most northern states outlawed its practice shortly after the Revolution, and in the south, Tobacco, the primary cash crop, was losing value In 1794, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin. This new invention helped to increase the profitability of cotton by mechanically removing its seeds. After 1800 the amount of cotton produced in the United States would double every 10 years. By the middle of the century, the United States produced three quarters of the worlds cotton.\nThe Haitian Revolution, a slave rebellion that lasted from 1791 to 1804, changed the whole direction of the slave system. In the next 100 years, slavery would be legally abolished in many of the colonies controlled by European empires."}

His friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson\u00a0had a great impact on him, and supported him in many ways. Emerson provided a place for Thoreau to live at Walden Pond, which inspired his book, \"Walden\". He is best known for his book \"water\"\n\"Walden\", a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, \"Civil Disobedience\", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state.\u00a0\nEarly life.\nThoreau was born on July 12, 1817 in Concord, Massachusetts. He spent his childhood with his three brothers and sisters: John, Helen, and younger sister Sophia. His father owned a local pencil factory, and his mother rented out parts of the family home to boarders - people who come from other places. Thoreau received his education at the public school in Concord, the private Concord Academy, and graduated from Harvard College.\nHow he became an author.\nOne day in the summer of 1841, Henry David Thoreau was worried about money after leaving his job at his father's pencil factory. Suddenly, the most famous writer at the time, Ralph Waldo Emerson, knocked on his door. Emerson asked him to work as a live-in handyman at his house. During the days he lived with Emerson, Thoreau began to have dreams of becoming a writer.\nProtest against the government.\nAs the government needed money for the Mexican-American War, Henry David Thoreau refused to pay a direct tax for the war. This was his first protest against the government. He thought war was a bad thing, so it was necessary to resist government. \u00a0That led to him being put into jail. Although people gave him advice to pay the tax, he still didn't pay it. He didn't fear the government and at the same time inspired other people to join this protest. The night in the jail allowed him to start writing his essay, \"Civil Disobedience\", In the notes, he talked about the thought process of active, stated refusal of a citizen to obey certain laws or demands, orders of the state, and commands of a government. After twenty years, the notes were printed into a book by the same name, and read by many people, including Martin Luther King Jr.\nLater years.\nOn May 6, 1862, Thoreau died of tuberculosis, a disease, which had been affecting him for many years. After he died, he left behind many unfinished notes. Some of them were later printed. When Thoreau died, Ralph Waldo Emerson said of him in his funeral speech: \"The country knows not yet, or in the least part, how great a son it has lost... His soul was made for the noblest society; he had in a short life exhausted the capabilities of this world; wherever there is knowledge, wherever there is virtue, wherever there is beauty, he will find a home.\"\nHe was first buried in the Dunbar family plot at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts. However, in 1870, his grave was moved to Author's Ridge towards the back of the cemetery to be closer to the graves of his writer friends Emerson, Alcott, Hawthorne, and Channing.\nInfluence on American society.\nHenry David Thoreau became successful because Ralph Waldo Emerson helped Thoreau spread his work in England. Thoreau's ideas were about nature. He was heavily influenced by Emerson, who also introduced him to . He set an example by doing things that inspired people during his lifetime. He is someone who didn\u2019t follow normal social rules .His ideas made him stand out during that time. He also had concerns about the environment and helped to build a canal. \nMajor works.\n\"Walden\" was printed in 1854, and it seemed to be one of the most well-liked books during that time. The book is about his stay in the woods by a pond in 1845 for two years, two months, two weeks, and two days. During this time, he learned many things like how to get in touch with nature and spend time with himself. The books, \"The Maine Woods\", \",\" and \"\" also supported these ideas of trying to have a more natural and non-material life-style."}

These action groups usually want to spread the news that being naked is a good feeling, even around other people. Usually males and females are mixed and spend their time together. Nakedness is seen without any relation to sex. Rather, these action groups want to enjoy common activities in the nude, like bathing. Often, they also want to do things nude where this is not really necessary, like naked bicycle tours.\nIt is difficult to know exactly when naturism began as an action group. In 1903, Paul Zimmermann opened the first club, \"Freilichtpark\" (in English, \"Free Light Park\"), near Hamburg, Germany. In the United States, German immigrant Kurt Barthel organized the first nudist event in the forest just outside of New York City. His club was called \"the American League for Physical Culture\" (ALPC) and started in the late 1920's. Zimmermann's vice president was a man named Ilsley Boone. Boone had been a minister (religious leader) of a large church. He quit to become involved with naturism all the time, and soon replaced Zimmermann as president. Also, he renamed the ALPC as the \"American Sunbathing Association.\" Since 1995, it is known as the \"American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR).\"\nNaturists come from many different social classes and backgrounds, and practice naturism for very different reasons. In addition, religion can affect how people dress. Islam generally does not allow anyone to be seen naked by others, except married couples in private, and young children by their parents and caregivers. Traditional Judaism is similar, but less strict about a group of people of the same sex. In India, Hinduism and Jainism have a few rituals with male nudism. Buddhism has little to say about naturism. If practiced, it is considered more of a way of living, than anything religious. Nudity and naturism are probably the most complicated in Christianity. Many Christians have similar views as those of traditional Judaism, the religion from which Christianity began and grew out of. Others, called \"Christian naturists,\" believe it is alright to be nude, and even to live nude, unless it is for the wrong reason or forced. They consider the human body to be the greatest creation of God. They think it is not shameful and should not be covered. In addition, they believe it was the devil, not God, who told Adam and Eve that they were naked upon eating from a fruit tree which was not theirs."}

The tramway was built in 1885. It is one of the oldest electric tramways in the world and is the only one of the earliest tramways that is still in operation in the United Kingdom.\nThe tramway is owned by Blackpool Borough Council and is run by Blackpool Transport as part of the \"Metro Coastlines\" network. The tramway runs for , and over 6,500,000 people travel on it each year.\nHistory.\nThe first part of Blackpool tramway opened on 29 September 1885. It was a conduit line. It ran from Cocker Street to Dean Street on the Blackpool Promenade. This was one of the first practical electric tramways built in the world. It opened six years after Werner von Siemens first showed electric traction. At the opening was Holroyd Smith, the person who created the system, and Alderman Harwood, the Mayor of Manchester, along with many other people.\nThe Blackpool Electric Tramway Company ran the line until 1892. At this point, the lease on the line finished, and Blackpool Corporation then ran the line. In 1895 another line was added. It ran from Manchester Square along Lytham Road to South Shore. In 1897 the tracks were extended to South Pier. A line was also built on Station Road that connected Lytham Road to the promenade.\nThe conduit system was changed to overhead wires in 1899. In 1900 the line was built more to the north to Gynn Square. It linked up the \"Blackpool &amp; Fleetwood Tramroad\" there. The Marton loop opened in 1901. It connected Talbot Square and Central Station along Church Street, Devonshire Square, Whitegate Drive, Waterloo Road and Central Drive. At Whitegate Drive in Marton a new depot was built. Another line was added from Talbot Square along Talbot Road to Layton on 1902. The promenade line had got as far as the Pleasure Beach by 1903.\nThe Blackpool Corporation took over the \"Blackpool &amp; Fleetwood Tramroad Company\" in 1920. The Corporation got eight miles of track and three depots from the take-over. Two depots were in Fleetwood and one was in Bispham. The small Bold Street Depot in Fleetwood was closed and a new loop was built at Fleetwood Ferry.\nThe depot at Blundell Street was replaced by a bigger one on Rigby Road in 1920. In 1925 the line to Fleetwood was made more direct between Rossall and Broadwater. The last extension was built in 1926. It went along the promenade to Clifton Drive at Starr Gate. A connection was made there with the Lytham St Annes tracks.\nThe first route closure took place in 1936. They were the Central Drive and Layton routes. In 1961 Lytham Road closed, and Marton closed one year later. The tramroad line on Dickson Road to North Station closed in 1963. Marton and Copse Road Depots closed in the same year. The depot at Bispham closed in 1966. All that was left was the track running from Starr Gate to Fleetwood. It is still there today. The running of the buses and tramway was handed over to Blackpool Transport Services Limited in 1986 by Blackpool Borough Council.\nNetwork.\nToday the tramway runs from Starr Gate in Blackpool to the Ferry Terminus in Fleetwood. Most of the route runs along the Fylde Coast sea front. At Cleveleys the line turns inland for a few miles. It then returns to the coast in Fleetwood. There are four different types of track:\nOn the line there are four turning loops. One is at Starr Gate, another is opposite the Pleasure Beach and two more are at Little Bispham and Fleetwood. There is also one that links into Rigby Road Depot.\nBlackpool tramway today.\nBlackpool runs a mix of double-deck and single-deck cars, though there are more single-deck trams in the fleet. The double-deck trams are used the most in the tourist season. The single-deck trams are not used as much at that time. They are sometimes used though when it is busy to let the system carry more passengers. Blackpool was the only town in the UK that kept its trams. Between 1962 and 1992 Blackpool was the only town with a tramway in the UK that was not a preserved system. The last English city to lose its trams was Sheffield in 1960. The last in the UK was Glasgow in 1962. Trams have been returning to the towns and cities in Britain since the Manchester Metrolink opened in Manchester in 1992.\nThere are lots of different trams in the fleet at Blackpool. Most of them were built in the 1930s and are still in service in an unchanged condition. Some others have had their bodywork changed. Sometime historic trams are borrowed from the National Tramway Museum in Crich and other museums for public service.\nThe trams from Starr Gate in the south to Fleetwood in the north. At busy periods such as the Blackpool Illuminations or on bank holidays services start or finish short at Cleveleys, Bispham or the Pleasure Beach. This means that more trams can run through the centre of Blackpool in a small period. When the Illuminations are on specially decorated trams carry passengers along the promenade and the illuminated area. The area runs from Starr Gate to Bispham. Until the opening of the Metrolink, Fleetwood was the only town in England that kept trams running down the main street.\nIn November 2007 the whole tramway closed for the first time. It was closed for five months for the second part of an \u00a311,800,000 upgrade. Blackpool Transport Services and Blackpool Council currently have a joint bid awaiting Government approval. It could give up to \u00a377,000,000 for a total upgrade of the trams and tracks. In January 2007 the City Class 611 prototype \"supertram\" was being tested on the tramway. It caught fire as it approached Central Pier. This caused lots of damage. The driver managed to get out of the cab. The tram was built by Mersyside-based Tram Power. It was being tested as part of a bid to replace the current trams. The same tram had already derailed on 30 May 2006 at Starr Gate loop in trials then. A Rail Accident Investigation Board report said that the derailmet was because of wear and tear on the track. They said another factor was the new type of running gear on the two-car prototype.\nThe company paid \u00a3150,000 to rebuild the tramcar. It cannot be re-tested until November 2008 at the earliest though. This is because testing is not allowed during the busy summer months and also because of the earlier closure of the tracks for repairs.\nA \u00a31 billion bid for a Government grant was made in 2002 by Blackpool Council and Lancashire County Council after the Government made a pledge to build 25 new tram networks by 2010. They want to expand the tram network to include St Annes to the south and new housing estates in Fleetwood to the north. There is a possible further phase to include links to Poulton-le-Fylde and Thornton. In 2004 campaigners behind the bid expressed disappointment that nothing had been done to take the plans forward in two years. By November 2007 there was no further development."}

It is often called birth control pill or simply \"The Pill.\" The pills contain hormones that make the women who take them infertile. Women who take the pill will not become pregnant during sexual intercourse. When a woman stops taking the pills, she will usually become fertile again. When taken as prescribed, the pills are one of the safest methods of contraception.\nIn the 1950s, scientists (such as Carl Djerassi, George Rosenkranz and Alejandro Zaffaroni) realized that the hormone progesterone stopped women from making eggs (stopped ovulation). After this discovery, the combined oral contraceptive pill was created. The combined oral contraceptive pill has two female hormones: estrogen and progesterone. Some oral contraceptive pills have only progesterone. These are often called the \"minipill\".\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill is thought to be safe and usually works well.\nIn the United States, the combined oral contraceptive pill was first given to women in 1960. It was a revolutionary breakthrough in contraception for two reasons. First, it is extremely effective at preventing pregnancy if it is used in the right way. Second, it was the first contraceptive to completely separate the act of contraception (in this case the taking of a pill) from sexual intercourse itself. Unlike barrier methods, when a woman is \"on the Pill,\" she and her man are usually not even aware of it during sexual intercourse, which seems and feels very natural. (In fact, it is possible for the woman to be on the pill without her partner even knowing.) The couple can have sex at any time they wish; they don\u2019t need to interrupt foreplay to put birth control in place, and they can feel the physical sensations and emotional closeness of intercourse without interference from a make or female condom. Unlike coitus interruptus, when a woman is on the Pill, intercourse usually ends with her man reaching orgasm while inside the vagina, which both the man and woman usually find very pleasurable. It may also make women's menses shorter and with less bleeding, as well as helping her complexion, which most women like. For all of these reasons, the Pill is very popular. In 2005, more than 80 million women across the world used the Pill. It is the most common method of contraception in the United States, with four out of five women there having used the pill for birth control at some point in their lives. Use of the Pill is different in different countries, and among women of different ages and levels of education. Both single women and married women use the Pill in large numbers.\nThe Pill has some slight risks for side effects. It may make a very small increase in the risk of blood clots in the lungs, strokes, heart attacks, and breast cancer. Most of these risk are small. Some women may experience mood swings, weight gain, or loss of sex drive. Sometimes, but rarely, these side effects are serious enough to make a woman decide to stop using the Pill.\nDifferent countries use different contraceptives.\nThe choices a woman has for contraception - and whether contraception is even available - depends on what country she lives in. These things are different in different countries. In the United Kingdom, one out of every 4 women aged 16\u201349 were using the Pill as at 2006 (either the combined pill or progestogen only pill (\"minipill\")). compared to only 1% of women in Japan.\nLocal culture and habits may also affect whether or not people use the Pill.\nIn some countries, women do not really have a choice because only one kind of contraception is available. In some countries (like Algeria, Morocco, and Zimbabwe), the Pill is the most common method offered by national family planning programs. In other countries, like India, national family planning programs only offer female sterilization (a surgery which makes a woman unable to ever have children again). Other countries, like Egypt and Vietnam, only offer the IUD, intrauterine device.\nDifferent kinds of pills.\nThere are two major kinds of oral contraceptive pills. The first kind has both estrogen and progesterone in it. The other only has progesterone (these are called progesterone-only pills, or POPs). The pills do not actually have natural hormones in them. Instead, they have other chemical substances that are mostly the same as the hormones, but have been made in a laboratory.\nSome women can only take one kind of COCP. For example, estrogen stops the breast from producing milk. Because of this, women who are breastfeeding should not take pills that have estrogen in them. There are also some other types of women who should not be given estrogen. These women should only use progesterone-only pills.\nWhile there are just two major kinds of birth control pills (COCPs and POPs), there are many different brands or versions of each kind of pill. Every brand of COCP will have the same hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in it. However, each brand has a different amount of hormones in it. Also, some brands change the amount of hormones given from week to week.\nEffectiveness.\nThere are two ways to measure how well COCPs work. (Most forms of birth control are also measured in these two ways.):\nTo show how well the Pill works, scientists figure out rates of effectiveness (for perfect use and for actual/typical use). These rates show how many women are kept from getting pregnant by the Pill. Rates of effectiveness usually look at how well the Pill works during the first year that women are using the Pill. Most often, the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates. However, some studies use decrement tables.\nThe typical use pregnancy rate for women taking COCPs measures how many women get pregnant while taking COCPs. All women are not equally likely to get pregnant while taking COCPs. Different groups of women have different typical use pregnancy rates. Overall, between 2% and 8% of women taking COCPs get pregnant every year. If COCPs are used perfectly, only 0.3% become pregnant each year.\nThere are a few reasons why women do not use the Pill perfectly. Because of these things, typical use effectiveness is lower than perfect use effectiveness.\nCOCPs can prevent pregnancy if the first pill is taken no later than 5 days after a woman starts menstruating. If the treatment is started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, COCPs cannot safely prevent pregnancy for the first 7 days of use. During this time, a woman needs to use other types of contraception in order to prevent pregnancy. When active pills have been taken for 7 days, COCPs can work well to prevent pregnancy. COCPs should be taken at about the same time every day.\nCertain things can make COCPs not work as well:\nProblems with other drugs.\nSome other medicines can interact with COCPs and make them not work as well. These medicines can also cause breakthrough bleeding (where a woman bleeds between her periods). Some of these medicines are:\nThe traditional medicinal herb St. John's Wort also seems to make COCPs not work as well. This is because of the way St. John's Wort affects the liver.\nNon-contraceptive uses.\nThe Pill can be used for other things besides contraception. There are many medical conditions that are caused by problems with hormone levels. Because the Pill has hormones in it, it can treat these conditions. Some of these conditions are:\nIf a woman's menstrual cycle is not regular, the Pill can make the woman menstruate on a regular schedule. The Pill can also be used to treat certain problems that cause bleeding from the uterus.\nWomen who use combined oral contraceptives are less likely to get cancer of the ovaries. If a woman takes Pill for five years, her risk for getting ovarian cancer is cut in half. Women taking the Pill are also only half as likely to get endometrial cancer than women who have never taken the Pill. The longer a woman uses the Pill, the more her risk of getting endometrial cancer drops. However, women who take the Pill have a higher risk of getting breast cancer and cervical cancer."}

Peer-to-peer architectures are often abbreviated using the acronym P2P.\nBoth client-server and P2P architectures are in wide usage today.\nClient-server relationship.\nThe client-server relationship describes the relation between the client and how it makes a service request to the server, and how the server can accept these requests, process them, and return the requested information to the client. The interaction between client and server is often described using sequence diagrams. Sequence diagrams are standardized in the Unified Modeling Language.\nTwo-tier.\nThe basic type of client-server software architecture employs only two types of hosts: clients and servers. This type of architecture is sometimes referred to as two-tier. The two-tier architecture means that the client acts as one tier and server process acts as the other tier.\nNetwork computing.\nThe client-server software architecture has become one of the basic models of network computing. Many types of applications have been written using the client-server model. Standard networked functions such as E-mail exchange, web access and database access, are based on the client-server model. For example, a web browser is a client program at the user computer that may access information at any web server in the world. \nExamples.\nSpecific types of servers include: web servers, FTP servers, database servers, E-mail servers, file servers, print servers. Most web services are also types of servers."}

An example of the opposite of the mainstream is counterculture. The term is sometimes used as a negative term. In the United States, Protestant with a mix of conservative, moderate, and liberal theologies are sometimes referred to as \"mainstream.\"\nIn movies.\nMainstream movies can be defined as movies that cost much to make and are created for profit. To pay the cost and make the profit they are made so very many people will want to pay to see them. They have a wide release to first run theaters. Those are movie theaters that run mostly new mainstream movies from the major movie companies. After their time in first-run theaters, mainstream movies are sold at popular stores. Hollywood and Bollywood movies are usually considered mainstream, and may also be blockbusters. The boundary is vague. An example of the opposite of mainstream movie is art films.\nIn literature.\nIn literature, \"mainstream\" refers to traditional realistic fiction, as opposed to genre fictions such as science fiction or mysteries.\nIn music.\nMainstream music refers to music that is familiar to and popular with the majority of people in their culture. For example, popular music or pop music. However, older generations often dislike the mainstream taste of the youth, and may not agree as to what is or is not mainstream.\nOpposing mainstream music is the music of subcultures. These opposing subcultures exist in most genres of music and is commonly found in punk rock, indie rock, and extreme metal, among others. In the 1960s, the music of the hippie counterculture exemplified this music. In more recent years, alternative rock, such as the music of Nirvana, has managed to maintain popularity in the mainstream music market even though their music did not conform to mainstream standards.\nPunk rock has set itself apart from other non-mainstream genres by self-asserting an active \"anti\"-mainstream social movement that resists commercialism and corporate control. The punk subculture usually does not appreciate major label bands that play punk music that denies the do it yourself (DIY) punk ethic, and thinks they are the same as mainstream music. Indie rock that surfaced in the early 1990s underground took this same DIY ethic. \nMainstream media.\nMany anti-corporate and not-for-profit forms of alternative protest have surfaced in the punk underground, for example, self-made publications known as \"zines\", where there is greater freedom to discuss controversial (usually far left) political issues such as bigotry, LGBT community issues, feminism, militant atheism, and veganism. Although the mainstream media often views this behavior as a youthful expression of rebellion, modern punk embodies a range of age groups who generally disagree with the perceived shared countercultural principals. It is not uncommon for middle-aged people to form punk houses (houses where people of the punk subculture live and open to others to stay, including touring bands) and resistance movements against what they see as the widespread, unfair use of human and animal rights for profit. This modern group is effectively voiced through the anarcho-punk and crust punk subcultures, in attempt to fight what is seen by those groups as a general of, and way to profit from, life.\nMainstreaming in education.\nMainstreaming refers to a type of education where children with a learning disability are mixed into classes with children without learning disabilities to help them learn better and to become comfortable with the \"mainstream\" of student life and life in their community. This is normally called \"integration\". When their needs cannot be met, they must be moved to special schools."}

If an album on Heatseekers does enter the top 100 of the \"Billboard\" 200, it and any albums the act later releases are not eligible to appear on the Heatseekers chart. Many artists have bypassed Top Heatseekers because their first chart entry debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at position 100 or above."}

Subcultures can be hobbies, groups or communities. A subculture is a group of people with a culture (whether distinct or hidden) which makes them different from the larger culture that they belong to, known as the \"dominant\" culture. If a subculture is described as opposing the dominant culture, it may be described as a counterculture. As Ken Gelder notes, subcultures are social, with their own shared rules, values and rituals, but they can also seem self-involved \u2014 another thing that makes them different from countercultures.\nIdentifying subcultures.\nSubcultures can be identified by the members' age, race, ethnicity, social class, location, or gender. The qualities that distinguish among subcultures may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors. Members of a subculture often signal each other through the use of fashion style, stereotypical behaviors, and use of a secret language created to prevent outsiders from understanding them (this is known as Argot). They also live out particular relations to places: Ken Gelder talks about 'subcultural geographies' along these lines.\nThe study of subcultures often involves the study of symbolism attached to clothing, music and other visible things by members of subcultures, and also the ways that these same symbols are seen and understood by members of the dominate culture. Subcultures have been documented by others for a long time. In some cases\u2014such as homeless people, criminal gangs or skateboarders\u2014subcultures have had laws created to control or end their activities. But subcultures also talk about themselves, very often."}

It is a sequel movie to \"Spider-Man\" and \"Spider-Man 2\" and has Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in the same roles as Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson. Spiderman gets a black suit from space, which begins to make him angry when fighting his enemies the Sandman and the new Goblin. He gets the black suit off, and it takes over another photographer called Eddie Brock to become another villain called Venom. Set shortly after the events of \"Spider-Man 2\", as Peter Parker prepares for his future with Mary Jane Watson, he faces three more villains: Uncle Ben's true killer, Flint Marko who becomes the Sandman after a freak accident; Harry Osborn, who is now aware of Peter's identity and seeks to avenge his father; and Eddie Brock, a rival photographer who becomes Venom. Peter also faces his greatest challenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote that augments his abilities but brings out his anger and other negative traits.\nDevelopment of \"Spider-Man 3\" began immediately after the successful release of \"Spider-Man 2\" for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer Avi Arad, he added Venom and the producers also requested the addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006, and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland before moving to New York City from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures Imageworks created over 900 visual effects shots. With an estimated production budget of $258\u2013350 million, it was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release.\n\"Spider-Man 3\" premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the third-highest-grossing film of 2007 and was the highest-grossing \"Spider-Man\" film until it was surpassed by \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, \"Spider-Man 3\" received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the performances, visual effects and action sequences, but criticized the overloaded storylines, subplots, and overabundance of villains. The majority of these topics were later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi and Arad.\nA fourth installment, titled \"Spider-Man 4\", was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a \"Venom\" spin-off film, but both were canceled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The \"Spider-Man\" film series was rebooted twice; first with \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" (2012) by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield; and later a new film series set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Jon Watts and starring Tom Holland, beginning with \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" (2017). The \"Venom\" spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with \"Venom\", set within Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters and directed by Ruben Fleischer and starring Tom Hardy.\nPlot.\nSeveral months after Otto Octavius' sacrifice, Peter Parker plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson, who has just made her Broadway musical debut. A meteorite lands at Central Park, and an extraterrestrial symbiote follows Peter to his apartment by latching on to his motorbike after he and Mary Jane leave there after stargazing. Harry Osborn, seeking vengeance for his father's death and having taken the performance-enhancing gas, attacks Peter with his father's Green Goblin technology, but the battle ends in a stalemate with Harry crashing down and having partial amnesia, losing his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and sick daughter before fleeing again. Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, he transforms into the Sandman, who can control sand and reform his body with it.\nDuring a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving Gwen Stacy's life, Peter kisses her, angering Mary Jane. Meanwhile, Marko robs an armored truck, easily defeats Peter and flees. NYPD Captain George Stacy, Gwen's father, informs Peter and his Aunt May that Marko was uncle Ben's true killer; the deceased Dennis Carradine was Marko's accomplice. At his apartment, while Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit to wait for Marko, the symbiote assimilates the suit; Peter later awakens at the top of a building, discovering that his costume has changed to black and his powers are enhanced; however, the symbiote brings out his dark side. Peter locates and battles Marko in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, he opens a pipe, releasing water that reduces Marko to mud and washes him away.\nPeter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, who is struggling in her career because of her shows receiving negative reviews from critics. She shares a tender moment with Harry, but leaves afterward in regret. Harry recovers from his amnesia, urged by a hallucination of his father and coerces Mary Jane into breaking up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves \"somebody else,\" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Peter confronts Harry over this and spitefully tells him that his father never loved him. Another battle ensues, with Harry throwing a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.\nAt the \"Daily Bugle\", Peter exposes rival photographer Eddie Brock, whose fake photos depict Spider-Man as a criminal. Publisher J. Jonah Jameson fires Brock and hires Peter to be a staff photographer. Later, Peter brings Gwen to a jazz club, where Mary Jane now works. Peter passionately dances with Gwen in front of Mary Jane, in order to make her jealous. Gwen, realizing this, apologizes to Mary Jane and leaves. After assaulting the bouncers and accidentally hitting Mary Jane, Peter finally realizes that the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church's bell tower, upon realizing high-pitched sounds weakens the creature, Peter removes the symbiote, where it bonds with Brock, transforming him into Venom. Brock locates Marko, who survived being washed away, and convinces him to join forces to defeat Peter.\nBrock abducts Mary Jane and holds her captive from a web high at a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. After Harry refuses to help Peter, he finally learns the truth about his father's death from his butler. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry arrives to help him with his Green Goblin technology and saves Mary Jane. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's glider, but Harry jumps in and is impaled himself. Peter, remembering the symbiote's weakness, assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. He activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote. However, Brock, who became addicted to its influence, attempts to save it, and ends up vaporized along with the symbiote.\nAfterward, Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted Marko ever since; Peter forgives Marko, allowing him to escape. Harry and Peter reconcile before Harry subsequently dies from his injuries. Sometime later after Harry's funeral, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile and share a dance at the jazz club."}

It is in Cowra Shire. It is 310m above sea-level and about 300 km west of Sydney. Cowra is on the banks of the Lachlan River.\nThe first name for Cowra was \"Coura Rocks\". This may have been the name of one of the first cattle farms. This name is probably the name of the river ford (crossing) where people could cross the Lachlan River.\nThe name Cowra comes from a local aboriginal word meaning \"eagle on the rocks\".\nIt should not be confused with another New South Wales town named Corowa.\nHistory.\nThe first people to live in the area were the Wiradjuri people. The first European explorer, George Wilson Evans, came into the Lachlan Valley in 1815. He named the area the Oxley Plains after his boss, the Surveyor-General, John Oxley. In 1817 he said the area was \"unfit for white settlement\". An army camp was set up soon after at Soldiers Flat near present-day Billimari. Arthur Ranken and James Sloan, from Bathurst, were amongst the first European settlers on the Lachlan. They moved to the area in 1831.\nThe township of Coura Rocks began in 1840. By 1847 the township was called Cowra. The village was officially listed in 1849.\nIn the 1850s many people looking for gold went through on their way to the gold fields at Lambing Flat (Young) and Grenfell. The first school was started in 1857. The first bridge over the Lachlan River was built in 1870. Gold was found at Mount McDonald in the 1880s. The railway, from Sydney, reached Cowra in 1886. Local government started in 1888. The first telephone were connected in 1901. The town water supply was started in 1909, the gas in 1912, and town supplied electricity was connected in 1924.\nCowra is home to the Australian copy of the United Nation's World Peace Bell. These are normally kept in a nation's capital city. It was given to Cowra because of its special role in international understanding, world peace and as a centre of world friendship.\nThe Cowra breakout.\nDuring World War II Cowra was the site of a prisoner of war (POW) camp. Most of the prisoners were captured Japanese and Italian soldiers, sailors and airmen. On August 5, 1944 about 545 (some sources say over 1000) Japanese POWs attempted a mass escape from the camp. This is perhaps the largest prison escape in the world. At the same time, other Japanese prisoners killed themselves, or were killed by their countrymen, inside the camp.\nThe POWs tried to capture machine gun posts, armed only with home made weapons. The Prime Minister John Curtin said this was a \"suicidal disregard of life\", and had no chance of success.\nDuring the escape 231 Japanese and 4 Australian guards were killed, and 108 prisoners were wounded. The dead Japanese were buried in Cowra in a specially made Japanese War Cemetery. This is the only such cemetery in Australia. It also has some of the dead from the WWII air raids on Darwin.\nAn Avenue of Honour also remembers those who died in World War I.\nJapanese Garden.\nThe Japanese War Cemetery was looked by members of the Cowra RSL and given to Japan in 1963. In 1971 the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link with Japan. They planned a Japanese garden for the town. The Japanese Government agreed to help as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead. The garden also received money from the Australian Government and private groups.\nThe garden was designed by Ken Nakajima (1914 - 2000). He was a world famous designer of Japanese gardens. The first part was opened in 1979, with a second part opened in 1986.\nThe gardens were built in the style of the Edo period. They are a \"kaiy\u016b-shiki\" or strolling garden. They are designed to show all of the landscape types of Japan. At five hectares, the Cowra Japanese Garden is the largest Japanese garden in the Southern Hemisphere. An annual \"Sakura Matsuri\" (cherry blossom festival) is held in the gardens during late September and/or early October each year. The garden also has other events during the year."}

The borrower needs to repay the lender the sum of money loaned part by part over time in order to clear the debt.\nActing as a provider of loans is one of the main tasks for financial institutions. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a main source of funding. Bank loans and credit are one way to increase the money supply.\nImportant components of a loan.\nA loan can be broadly described by the following terms. \nDeposit or Down-payment.\nThe deposit or down-payment is an amount of money that the borrower is required to pay, as the first contribution towards clearing the debt, so that the loan deal can be finalized. The deposit is usually higher than the monthly contribution towards the loan. Some loans require a deposit while some do not. The deposit is usually a fraction, typically a percentage, of the total amount that is loaned out.\nInstallments.\nAn Installment is money that is a monthly payment towards the loan. It may not be necessarily paid monthly but it has to be paid from time to time over throughout the loan deal. Installments are paid according to a loan rate.\nInterest.\nInterest is a charge on top of the value of the loan, that acts as a cost of the loan. Interest is paid according to a rate called an interest rate. The interest rate varies from loan to loan and from lender to lender.\nTypes of loan.\nLoans can be broadly classified as either secured or unsecured loans.\nSecured and unsecured loans.\nSecured loans are loans for which the borrower is required to guarantee repayment, by pledging with property, for instance a car, a house etc. This property is called security or collateral. Because of the pledging, secured loans are given in larger amounts and have lower interest rates. However, there is a risk of losing the property used as security, in the event that the loan is not paid off.\nAn example of a secured loan is a mortgage.\nUnsecured loans are loans that are given without pledges of repayment. This means that the borrower is not required to provide security to get the loan.\nBecause of the high risk involved, unsecured loans are given out in smaller amounts and have higher interest rates. The lenders raise the interest rates in an effort to recover their money as quickly as possible. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.\nPersonal loans.\nA personal loan is a 'small expense' loan that is mostly used by people to \nfinance their day to day emergencies. They come in smaller amounts and\ntherefore, just like most unsecured loans, they are easily approved.\nHome loans.\nHome loans are loans that are taken for the purpose of buying a house.\nHome loans are secured loans. The house acts as a collateral or security\nto the loan. \nPayday loans.\nPayday loans are signature loans or cash advances that requires no security. This means that it is possible to get a payday loan even with a bad credit status or no credit at all. Payday loans are given on the basis of employment and income.\nHowever, payday loans have a high interest rate especially when the paying\nschedule is not followed. The high interest rates are a cost of convenience.\nInterest could run as high as 2000%, for this reason, it is not a good idea to\ntake a payday loan if you don't expect to earn enough to repay it.\nAuto loans.\nAuto loans are loans given out by financial institutions or car dealerships, for the purpose of buying an automobile. Due to the nature of automobiles to lose value with time, Auto loans usually have high interest rates. The shorter the time an auto loan is paid, the lower the overall cost of the loan will be.\nBike Loan.\nA two wheeler loan enables you to buy a bike of your choice on low-interest rates with monthly EMIs without hurting your budget. Bike Loan is a credit line for people who want to own a bike, but don't have the cash up front to make a purchase.\nMortgage.\nMortgage is a loan that is used specifically to purchase a house. Usually, a mortgage is given to you by a mortgage company or any financial institution, after evaluation of your potential to pay back the loan in full. A mortgage is a secured loan, therefore, providing collateral is necessary. Mortgage can be further classified into long-term and short-term mortgages, depending on the length of time required for the mortgage to be paid. Short-term mortgages usually have a term of 15 years while long\u2013term mortgages have a 30-year term.\nCredit card loans.\nWhen you get a credit card, you have taken a loan. This is a credit card loan, and just like any other loan, it comes with interest and fees. Credit card loans are given out by credit companies and most banks today. The interest rates on credit card loans are higher than that on most personal loans, often around 15%."}

Real property can be land, a house, or a building. Many people do this to buy the home they use for mortgage: the loan provides them the money to buy the house and the loan is guaranteed by the house.\nIn a mortgage, there is a debtor and a creditor. The debtor or mortgagor is the owner of the property, while the creditor or mortgagee is the owner of the loan. When the mortgage transaction is made, the debtor gets the money with the loan, and promises to pay the loan. The creditor will receive money back with interest over time (usually in payments made each month by the debtor). If the debtor does not pay the loan, the creditor may take the mortgaged property in place of the loan. This is called foreclosure.\nIn the 2008 American economic failure, creditors lent money to debtors who could not pay back that money. This lowered housing prices and hurt the economy.\nTypes of mortgage.\nSimple mortgage.\nDefined under Section 58(b) of the Indian Transfer of Property Act as a simple mortgage is a transaction whereby \u2018without delivering possession (ownership or occupancy) of the mortgaged property, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the mortgage money and agrees, expressly or implicitly, that in the event of his failing to pay according to his contract, the mortgagee shall have a right to cause the mortgaged property to be sold by a decree (an order of law) of the court in a suit(a case in a law court) and the proceeds of the sale to be applied so far as may be necessary in payment of the mortgage money; there is no foreclosure of the mortgaged property. Normally a mortgage is to be registered if the mortgaged money is Rs.100 or more. Mortgage deed is to be executed and appropriately stamped ad valorem with two best available witnesses.\nIt can be said generally when the possession of the mortgaged property is not delivered, the transaction is simple mortgage.\nEnglish mortgage.\nA mortgage has a product term and a mortgage term, the mortgage term is the total amount of time you will have the mortgage (typically 10 to 25 years) where the product term is how long you will be tied into a fixed rate (normally 2 to 5 years) The borrower promises to repay the borrowed money on a certain date and if it is a repayment mortgage will have cleared the mortgage in full by the end of the mortgage term. The borrower transfers the property to the lender. The lender will re transfer the property when the money is repaid when the mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the mortgagee. The land registry holds information on who owns a property and which properties have charges outstanding on them.\nEnglish mortgage is a type of mortgage where the ownership of property is transferred to the mortgagor on a condition that the mortgagee will transfer the ownership on repayment of the loan, the title deeds are transferred to the mortgagee\nReverse mortgage.\nA reverse mortgage is a loan where the lender pays the monthly instalments to the borrower instead of the borrower paying the lender. The payment stream is reversed. A reverse mortgage allows people to get tax-free income from the value of their home. They are mainly to improve older people's personal and financial independence.\nUsufructuary mortgage.\nIn this form of mortgage, the property is given as a security to the mortgagee, who is let into possession or is permitted to repay himself out of the rents and profits of such property. Following Two points should be noted carefully with respect to Usufructary mortgage, that is \n(i) Possession must be given to the mortgagee, or the mortgagor must expressly or impliedly bind himself to deliver possession and \n(ii) The mortgagor will not be personally liable, unless there is a distinct agreement to the contrary.\nThe lender takes the property. The lender receives income from the property (rent, profit, interest, etc.) until the money is paid back. The owner keeps the title deeds with him."}

Another more specific phrase used for this meaning of bandwidth is monthly data transfer.\nWeb hosting companies often quote a monthly data transfer for a website, for example 500 gigabytes per month.

One representation of the integral, is the area under a curve in a graph. The Riemann sum is calculated by splitting the region into equal parts. In each part, the function is replaced by a shape. Shapes that are commonly used are rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas and cubics.The area of the similar shape can then be calculated. This method is often used when finding the closed form integral is difficult or impossible. The shapes used also influence how accurate the approximation is. More complex shapes give a higher accuracy, but this also means that calculating the approximation becomes more difficult.\nBecause the region filled by the small shapes is usually not exactly the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured. This error can be reduced by dividing up the region more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the Riemann integral.\nThe Riemann sum may also be used to define the integration operation. The sum is named after a German mathematician who was called Bernhard Riemann.\nDefinition.\nYou divide the horizontal length under the part of the function you want to evaluate into \"n\" equal pieces. That is the n on top of the \u03a3 (Greek letter sigma). The (xi-xi-1) represents the size of one horizontal segment that is created from dividing the whole by the \"n\". The f(yi) is a y value in an \"n\" segment. Since the area of a rectangle is \"length\" \u00d7 \"width\", the multiplication of xi and f(yi) is the area of a rectangle for that part of the graph. The \u03a3 means we add up all of these small rectangles to get an approximation of the area under the segment of a function."}

In this kind of life, a person gets rid of worldly pleasures for religion or spirituality. A person might not have sex or drink alcohol. One might spend much of their time in prayer or meditation. Often, the reason is to follow goals of Christianity and the Indian religions (including yoga). These teach that salvation and freedom involve a process of changing one's mind and body. This is done by limiting speech, what one thinks and does with the body. \nThe earliest people who practiced Buddhism, Jainism, and the Christian hermits, lived very simply and without luxury. They rejected sensual pleasures and keeping money. This did not mean that life could not be enjoyed. But spiritual and religious goals are hindered by such indulgence. \nAsceticism is closely related to the abstinence and the Christian concept of chastity and might be said to be the technical implementation of the abstract vows of renunciation. Those who practice ascetic lifestyles do not consider their practices as virtuous but pursue such a life-style in order to satisfy certain technical requirements for mind-body transformation. There is remarkable uniformity among the above religions with respect to the benefits of sexual continence. Religions teach that purifying the soul also involves purification of the body which thereby enables connection with the Divine and the cultivation of inner peace. In the popular imagination asceticism is considered a sort of perversion (self-flagellation by birch twigs as the archetypal stereotype of self-mortification) but the \"ask\u0113sis\" enjoined by religion functions in order to bring about greater freedom in various areas of one's life, such as freedom from compulsions and temptations bringing about peacefulness of mind with a concomitant increase in clarity and power of thought. Asceticists sometimes neglect their maslowist or maslowic needs."}

The church also has the Museum of St. Mark (Museo di S. Marco) which shows paintings by Fra Angelico.\nThe Domincan Convent was begun in the early 1400s. The first \"prior\" (head man) was St. Antoninus of Florence. The famous painter known as Fra Angelico was one of the first of the Dominican Friars to live and work there. He later became the prior. The land for the convent was given to the friars by Cosimo Medici. The monks lived in small rooms called \"cells\". Cosimo had a cell built for himself, where he could stay sometimes. Between 1447 and 1452 Cosimo got his favourite architect, Michelozzo, to build a large new library and improve other parts of the building. In the late 1700s, the facade (front) of the building was rebuilt in a Classical style.\nIn 1490, the prior of St. Marks was a famous Domincan called Savonarola. He lived in the cell that had once belonged to Cosimo Medici. He was a great preacher. He disliked Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo Medici, who was often called \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\" (Lorenzo il Magnifico). He thought that Lorenzo had too much power and was acting like a prince. He preached against Lorenzo, against the Pope and against the Roman Catholic Church. He told everyone that the end of the world was near. Many people became frightened or depressed by the things that he said. Pope Alexander VI had Savonarola arrested. He was tortured and put to death in 1498. 60 years later, the Church agreed that, in fact, he had said nothing wrong.\nTreasures.\nThe Library of St. Mark's contains many illuminated manuscripts.

After this, many more Africans came to South Arabia as slaves; men were usually traded and the women were kept as servants for the Arab leaders. Mixed race children were more valuable in South Arabia. Two such children became Princes of the Abbassids. At this time, the Arabian army, known as the Sabaens, moved to Ethiopia. In Iraq, Bantu-speaking Africans were called Zanj. The large number of Zanj slaves working in bad conditions in Iraq lead to the famous Zanj Rebellion over fifteen years (869-883 AD). African rebels took over many of Iraq's cities forcing Arabs to flee to African nations such as Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania. Today someone of African and Arab descent is considered Afro-Arab.\nA former slave by the name of Najah seized power in the 10th century and established the Banu Najah dynasty, the first royal Afro-Asian family.\nSouth Asia.\nAs early as 1100 AD, African slaves were brought to India by Arab merchants in medieval times from the Bantu-speaking parts of eastern Africa. These Africans became known as Siddi or Habshi, Arabic word meaning Black African. Today, marriage has made the Siddi population in India much smaller. Someone of Indian and African background is considered an Indo-African. In South Asia, there are over 15,000 individuals who identify as Afro-Asian.\nUnited States.\nIn 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and Chinese workers who chose to stay in the U.S. could no longer be with their wives who stayed behind in China. Because White Americans looked at Chinese labor workers as stealing jobs, they were treated badly. Many Chinese men settled in black communities and in turn married black women.\nTiger Woods, a famous golf player, is of white, black, Native American, Chinese and Thai descent; his mother being half Thai and his father being half African-American. R&amp;B singer Amerie is another famous Afro-Asian-American, with her mother Korean and her father being black. Hines Ward, an NFL football player who currently plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is also an Afro-Asian.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 106,782 Afro-Asian individuals in the United States.\nThe West Indies.\nIn the 1860s, Chinese people were imported for labor and trade. It became more common for a Chinese man to marry a black woman since there was more black women than Chinese women. According to the 1946 Census, 12,394 Chinese were located between Jamaica and Trinidad. 5,515 of those who lived in Jamaica were Chinese-Jamaican and another 3,673 were Chinese-Trinidadians living in Trinidad. In Guyana and Haiti, there is also a very small percentage within the minority who are of Asian descent.\nHaitian painter Edouard Wah was born to a Haitian mother and Chinese father.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe UK has a large mixed race population, which is about 1.4% of the population (or around 850,000 people). The largest groups are mixed Whites and Black and mixed Whites and Asians. However, there are over 70,000 UK citizens that are mixed race and do not fit the above descriptions, a large percentage of these are Afro-Asian.

RC6 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. RC stands for \"Rivest Cipher\", or alternatively, \"Ron's Code\".\nIn 1997, the NIST announced a competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES) to be known as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). RC6 was derived from RC5 to meet the competition requirements, and was selected as one of the \"five finalists\" of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition, but was not selected as a standard.\nIn order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels, RC6 allows choices for the block size: 32 bits (for experimentation and evaluation purposes only), 64 bits (for use as a replacement for DES), and 128 bits (intended for AES). The number of rounds can range from 0 to 255, while the key sizes can range from 0 bits to 2040 bits in size. \nRC6 is very similar to RC5 in structure and could be viewed as interweaving two parallel RC5 encryption processes. However, RC6 does use an extra multiplication operation not present in RC5 and the use of four b/4-bit working registers (see splitting of plaintext blocks in feistel cipher) instead of two b/2-bit registers as in RC5 (b is the block size). Integer multiplication is used to increase the diffusion achieved per round so that fewer rounds are needed and the speed of the cipher can be increased.&lt;br&gt;The reason for using four working registers instead of two is mainly for optimization on 32-bit CPUs. The default block size of RC5 was 64 bits, while the default block size of the AES is 128 bits. RC5 has only two working registers. It uses 32-bit operations when dealing with 64-bit blocks and 64-bit operations when dealing with 128-bit blocks, so four working registers are required to build the AES architecture using only 32-bit operations.\nRC6 is a proprietary and patented algorithm (by RSA Security and ), and may require licensing and royalty payments for any products using the algorithm. It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin, and was also submitted to the NESSIE and CRYPTREC projects."}

RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR (Xor)s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of \"nothing up my sleeve numbers\".

Since the publication of Roy Andrew Miller's \"Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages\" in 1971, some also included Japanese (Nicholas Poppe) or Japonic, consisting of Japanese and Ryukyuan.\nA few linguists (such as (Street 1962)) even count Ainu with the Altaic languages but as part of a node including Korean and Japanese, in contrast to a Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic node, with Korean-Japanese-Ainu and Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic, in turn, forming a higher-level node.\nThe core version of Altaic, consisting of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, is sometimes referred to as \"Micro-Altaic,\" and the expanded version, including Korean and sometimes Japanese, is referred to as \"Macro-Altaic,\" but even the core version is very controversial."}

Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1987. \"RC\" stands for \"Rivest Cipher\", or alternatively, \"Ron's Code\".\nRC2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable key size and using 18 rounds.\nRounds are arranged as a source-heavy feistel network, with 16 rounds of one type called \"mixing rounds\" interleaved by two rounds of another type called \"mashing rounds\".\nThe 18 rounds are performed using the following interleaved sequence: \nRC2 uses \"key-expansion algorithm\" by which an expanded key consisting of 64 (16-bit words) is produces depending in a complicated way on every bit of the supplied \"variable-length\" input key. A mixing round consists of four applications of the \"mix-up\" transformation, as shown in the diagram. A round is \"mashed\" by adding to it one of the 16-bit words of the expanded key (RFC 2268).\nRC2 is susceptible to a related-key attack using 234 chosen-plaintext attacks (Kelsey \"et al.\", 1997).\nThe development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus, who were seeking a custom cipher be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software, after evaluation by the NSA. The NSA suggested a couple of changes, which Ronald Rivest incorporated. After further negotiations, the cipher was approved for export in 1989.\nAlong with RC4, RC2 with a 40-bit key size was treated under US export regulations for cryptography. Now all 40-bit encryption algorithms are obsolete because they are dangerously susceptible to brute force attacks.\nInitially, the details of the algorithm were kept secret \u2014 proprietary to RSA Security \u2014 but on 29 January 1996, source code for RC2 was anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum, sci.crypt. A similar post had occurred earlier with RC4. It is unclear whether the poster had access to the specifications or whether it had been reverse engineered."}

Militia who did not like the independence in East Timor started the conflict when they attacked civilians. These attacks led to more violence all over the country. Most of the violence occurred in the capital Dili.\nThe violence started after the result of an election was independence from Indonesia. About 1400 people are thought to have died. An UN force (InterFET) made up mainly of people from the Australian Defence Force was sent to East Timor to establish and maintain peace.\nDetails.\nBackground: referendum.\nIn 1999, there was a lot of pressure on Indonesia. Therefore, the Indonesian government decided to hold a vote. In this referendum it asked the people of East Timor, whether they wanted to stay with Indonesia or become independent. Portugal had done some lobbying. The referendum was held on August 30. In it, a clear majority (78.5%) of people voting said they would prefer to become independent. The alternative proposal would have been to stay with Indonesia, but to have many freedoms as an \"autonomous province\", called Special Autonomous Region of East Timor (SARET).\nViolence.\nDirectly after the referendum, violence broke out. The violence came from Indonesian soldiers and from a special East Timorese pro-integration militia which was supported by Indonesia. These troops became violent and terrorised the population. They did not like how the people had voted. About 14,000 Timorese people were killed. 300.000 had to flee to West Timor to live as refugees. Most of the infrastructure of the country, including houses, watering systems, and the electricity was destroyed. Noam Chomsky said: \"In one month, this massive military operation murdered some 2,000 people, raped hundreds of women and girls, displaced three-quarters of the population, and demolished 75 percent of the country's infrastructure.\"\nInterFET.\nOn 20 September 1999 the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) came to the country. This ended the violence. Activists in Portugal, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere pressured their governments to take action. US President Bill Clinton eventually threatened Indonesia, that the IMF loans would be stopped. Indonesia was in deep economic troubles already. The Indonesian government agreed to withdraw its troops and allowed a multinational force into Timor to stabilize the area. It was clear that the UN did not have sufficient resources to fight the paramilitary forces directly. Instead, the UN authorised the creation of a multinational military force known as INTERFET (International Force for East Timor), with Security Council Resolution 1264. 23 nations sent troops, about 11,000 people in total. The force was led by Major-General Peter Cosgrove. Troops landed in East Timor on 20 September 1999."}

The Earl\u2019s taxes were very high, and people in Coventry was very upset about it. Lady Godiva begged her husband to lower the taxes many times, but he never agreed to. Finally, the Earl told Lady Godiva that if she rode through the streets completely naked, he would lower the taxes. Lady Godiva sent a message through town that told everyone to close their shutters and stay indoors. Then, she rode through town only clothed by her hair. The Earl gave in and lowered the taxes of the town. However, a tailor named Tom drilled a hole through his shutters, and caught a glimpse of Lady Godiva. He was struck blind, some think from heaven, and some think the town \u201ctook care of him\u201d themselves. This is where the phrase \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d for a voyeur comes from.

In 2013 there were 514,417 people living there, which makes it the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom.\nIt is a city and metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. Manchester was given city status in 1853. The city is in the middle of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, which has 2,240,230 people, and is the United Kingdom's third largest built-up place.\nManchester is a very important city in England, and is often called the \"Capital of the North\". Manchester has many places for the arts, places for learning, businesses providing media as well as lots of shops. In a poll of British managers in 2006, Manchester was named the best place in Britain to have a business. A report in 2007 said Manchester is a fast-growing city (meaning lots of jobs are being created). Manchester was the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. It has two well-known football teams, Manchester United and Manchester City.\nManchester was the first city to industrialise, because of the Industrial Revolution. It became the main place for making cloth and fabric. During the 19th century it had the nickname Cottonopolis, because it had so many cotton mills. The middle of Manchester is important because of its network of canals and mills built during its 19th-century development.\nHistory.\nIn the late 18th century, Manchester was much smaller than it is today with about 40,000 people living there. This changed at the start of the Industrial Revolution. During this time, there were revolts about the living conditions for workers. The most well known of these revolts was the Peterloo Massacre. Fifteen to twenty people were killed during the Peterloo Massacre and hundreds of other people were hurt. In 1780, Richard Arkwright built the first cotton mill in the area.\nLater in the 1800s, Manchester became most important cotton town in the world. It was also the first 'industrialised' city, meaning that it was the first city to have a big amount of industry in it. Only a small amount of cloth is still made in the city and the trade has mainly stopped. This left a big number of old buildings from that time including the Town Hall, Free Trade Hall and Central Library and left a lot of other buildings empty.\nThe Manchester Ship Canal was created by the digging of canals in the rivers Irwell and Mersey for from Salford to the Mersey estuary. This let ocean going ships sail into the Port of Manchester.\nThe county of Greater Manchester was made in 1974. The county was made from cities and towns in southern Lancashire and northern Cheshire (the two main areas which make up Greater Manchester), and some mainly rural districts of Derbyshire and Yorkshire.\nIn 1996, the Irish Republican Army put a bomb in a truck in the centre of the city. Nobody was killed, but it did a lot of damage.\nOn 22 May 2017, a bombing occurred at the Manchester Arena which killed 22 people and injured 55. It was a suicide bombing.\nGeography.\nManchester is northwest of England's capital, London. The city has many canals and rivers which were important to its growth, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. The largest open space in the city is Heaton Park. It has an area of about . Heaton Park is a place that attracts many people every year. People go there to see the many animals and the beauty of the countryside. Much of Manchester is built-up (or 'urbanised'). Much of Manchester's rain comes over from the Pennines, which are hills to the east of the city. The city is mainly urban areas but also has some areas which are mainly of farmland. To the south of the centre is Manchester Airport. This is the third largest airport in the United Kingdom.\nCulture.\nA revival of the city's importance started in the 1980s. This was partly led by a vibrant music scene whose spirit was called 'Madchester'. It was led by bands such as The Happy Mondays and Joy Division. The Smiths came from nearby Salford.\nThe scene was partly fuelled by the number of students attending the universities and further education colleges in the city. Manchester has the most students in the United Kingdom in term time.\nThe University of Manchester is the largest university in the UK. It has over 30,000 students. The city also has the UK's fourth largest university, the Manchester Metropolitan University.\nThe city has two Premier League football teams, Manchester City and Manchester United. Football is a very important part of the culture of the city. Many of the people support or show interest in the sport.\nTransport.\nManchester and North West England are served by Manchester Airport. The airport has the most passengers in the UK outside London, with 22.1\u00a0million passengers in 2007. Planes fly to lots of destinations in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than from London Heathrow).\nManchester is very well served by train and in terms of passengers, Manchester Piccadilly was the busiest English train station outside London in 2005 and 2006. Northern Rail operates all over the north of England, and other operators include Virgin Trains. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first passenger railway in the world. Greater Manchester has a very big railway network. The city centre has over a lot of park and ride sites. Manchester became the first city in the UK to get a new tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. There are lots of new lines being built.\nThe city has one of the biggest bus networks outside London with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester area around the city. First Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester are the main bus operators. First Manchester also operates three free bus services called Metroshuttle which carry workers around Manchester's business areas.\nA big canal network runs though the city, built in the Industrial Revolution, today mainly used for leisure. The Manchester Ship Canal is open, but not many boats use it.\nBuildings.\nManchester's buildings display many different types of building styles, from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The very common use of red bricks characterises the look of the city. Much Manchester's architecture dates back to its days as a global centre for the trade of cotton. Just outside the city centre is a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left mostly untouched since they were closed, while many others have been turned into apartment buildings and office spaces.Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the gothic revival style and is thought of by many to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in all of England.\nEducation.\nThere are two universities in the city of Manchester. The University of Manchester, created in 2004 when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST were combined, is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom. The Manchester Business School, at the University of Manchester, was the first school to offer an MBA course in the United Kingdom in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was created as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It was given university status in 1992, and in the same year, combined with Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education, in South Cheshire.\nTwin cities.\nManchester has twinning plans (or \"friendship agreements\") with lots of places. In addition, the British Council has a \"metropolitan centre\" in Manchester. Although not an official twin city, Tampere, Finland is known as \"the Manchester of Finland\" \u2013 or \"Manse\" for short. Also, Ahmedabad, India became the centre of a booming textile industry, and it got the nickname \"\"the Manchester of the East\".\""}

It is run by the BBC. It takes place every year in November. The appeal has raised over \u00a31 billion since it started in 1980.\nOverview.\nChildren in Need has been given one evening on BBC One every year since 1980. Events aimed at raising money for charities working with children in the UK were shown. In 2007 over \u00a339 million was raised. \u00a319 million was raised on the programme. In 2008, nearly \u00a322 million was raised on the night. The BBC also broadcast local fundraising events on the radio stations and regional television channels. The programme's mascot is called 'Pudsey', or 'Pudsey Bear'. It is a yellow teddy bear with a bandage over one eye. It was first seen in 1985. Pudsey and the Children in Need Logo were changed in 2007. Children in Need became a registered charity in 1989.\n.Most of the money raised by the appeal comes from people who may have raised it themselves by taking part in sponsored events. A popular event is to sit in a bath of baked beans. Lots of companies also donate money or benefits. In the past, HSBC have helped with banking and BT have helped with the donation call centres and phone lines. On the night of the seven-hour long television programme lots of celebrities appear to support the cause and ask for donations. Various performances are often given, including sketches and musical numbers. There are also featurettes that show what the money is used for. Celebrities that appear are from both the BBC's own programmes, and also from the rival ITV network. They often appear in character and on the sets of their own programmes. One of the most popular features has been a musical number by the BBC newsreaders. In 2006 they had a \"James Bond\" theme, and in 2008 it was a \"Mamma Mia!\" one. The stars of newly opened West End musicals also perform songs from their shows later in the evening, after the 'curtain call' of the actual show performance for that evening. The total is also show on a screen about every hour. The presenters always accompany this with the phrase \"every penny counts\" to help to push the total beyond that of the previous year.\nMost of the British public support Children in Need, but some have a different view. They say that showing children on television as victims, many of which are disabled, is unfortunate and counter-productive. Changes in society will be better for such children than money and sympathy.\nMoney that is given to Children in Need is used in lots of ways. When the appeal for the year closes, the money is given to organisations that help children that are at the age of 18 and under. The children that are helped often have mental, physical or sensory disabilities, or have behavioural or psychological disorders. Others live in poverty or deprivation, and some are living in distress, are sexually abused or just neglected. These children are in need of some help and children in need provides a basis for that help."}

One of rock music's most successful acts, the group have sold over 210 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million albums in the United States alone.\nPink Floyd had moderate mainstream success and were one of the most popular bands in the London underground music scene in the late 1960s led by Syd Barrett; however, Barrett's decline in health would eventually forced his band members to replace him with guitarist and singer David Gilmour. After Barrett left the group Pink Floyd released \"Ummagumma\". The album was released as a double disc, the first disc contained songs performed live the other disc contained the new studio recorded songs. Singer and bass player Roger Waters gradually became the leader of the band in the mid-1970s, until 1985 when he left the group. The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973), \"Wish You Were Here\" (1975), \"Animals\" (1977), and \"The Wall\" (1979) with all of them topping the American record chart with the exception of Animals. \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" is the third best-selling studio album in the world (not counting compilations and various artists soundtracks). In 1985, Waters stated that Pink Floyd was no more, but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Waters sued the remaining members for the rights to the name, Waters lost and the band enjoyed worldwide success with \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" (1987) and \"The Division Bell\" (1994).\nSingles.\na These singles would later appear on the Pink Floyd compilation \"The Early Singles\"."}

Thus, there is a better representation of those who voted for the government that holds the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty.\nIn the government of a country that uses responsible government, the leaders of the executive branch of government (called the cabinet) are also members of the legislature. Also, the cabinet must have the support of the majority of the legislature to stay in power. If it loses the support of the legislature, there will be an election or a different political party will make a new cabinet.\nCountries that use responsible government usually have parliamentary systems of government. Some examples of countries that have responsible government are the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.\nIn countries that do not have responsible government, the cabinet and the legislature are each elected separately. This system has more separation of powers than a system with responsible government. Some examples of countries that \"do not\" have a system of responsible government are the United States and France. "}

The rivers flow between the Khao Luang mountain range and the Khao Banthat mountain range.\nTrang used to be a port involved in foreign trade and transportation. Trang was the first province in Thailand where rubber trees were planted. Governor Mahison Phakdi brought rubber from Malaysia and planted it here in 1899. Rubber is now considered an important product of Thailand.\nThe monsoon season on the Andaman Coast runs from June to September, when there are very big storms and a lot of rain. The province is driest during October to May.\nIn the past, Trang's name was Ta-Rang, a Malay name. The Thai people later shortened the name into one syllable.\nDistricts.\nThe province is divided into ten districts (\"amphoe\"):"}

Most Palestinians view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as the area of their future state, which is a view also accepted by most Israelis. A handful of academics advocate a one-state solution, where all of Israel, the Gaza Strip, and West Bank would become a bi-national state (a country for both Israelis and Palestinians) with equal rights for all. However, there are big areas of disagreement over the form of any final agreement and also about the level of trust each side has in the other in following an agreement.\nIn 1920, 1937, 1948, 1967, 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2021 there were agreements to split the land into two countries, away from the original plan of a Jewish state in all of mandatory Palestine (Jordan and Israel).

It includes work made in many different ways including painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpting, ceremonial clothing and sand painting. Aboriginal art is closely linked to religious ceremonies or rituals. It is an important part of the world's oldest continuous cultural tradition, based on totems and the Dreaming. \nAustralian Indigenous art is the oldest ongoing tradition of art in the world. The earliest artworks were rock carvings, body painting and ground designs, which date back more than 30,000 years.\nSymbols are used in aboriginal art, to show different things. While the meaning of these symbols is often shared, they can change meaning within the same piece, and they can be different between different groups. Aboriginal art is a language in itself, communicating through beautiful patterns. This started around 30,000 to 40,000 years ago.\nSome aboriginal artists sell their artwork for a lot of money. In 2007 Pitjantjatjara artist Yannima Pikarli Tommy Watson sold a painting for AU$240,000.\nIn 2010 the Queensland Government said that it would have the first two Tilt Trains painted by indigenous artists Judy Watson and Alick Tipoti. With seven carriages and two locomotives, the trains will be 185 metres long, making them the biggest modern aboriginal art piece. The Tilt Trains will run between Brisbane and Cairns.\nTypes of art.\nThere are several types of aboriginal art and ways of making art. This includes rock painting, dot painting, rock engravings, bark painting, carvings, sculptures, and weaving and string art. \nRock painting.\nAustralian indigenous art is the oldest unbroken tradition of art in the world. The oldest dated rock art painting in Australia is a charcoal image on a rock, drawn 28,000 years ago. It is one of the oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth. It was found in the Narwala Gabarnmang rock shelter in south-western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. \nRock art includes painting and engraving or carving. It can be found at sites throughout Australia, but is difficult to date. Some examples in the Pilbara area of Western Australia and at Olary in South Australia are believed to be 40,000 years old. Some art shows extinct animals such as \"Genyornis\" and \"Thylacoleo\". Other paintings show the arrival of European ships.\nRock engravings.\nThe indigenous Australians used different ways of making a rock engraving. This often depended on the type of rock. There are several different types of rock art across Australia. The most famous sites are Murujuga in Western Australia, the Sydney rock engravings around Sydney in New South Wales, and the Panaramitee rock art in Central Australia. The Sydney engravings show carved animals and humans in a style not found elsewhere in Australia. \nThe rock art at Murujuga is said to be the world's largest collection of petroglyphs. It has images of animals such as the thylacine, which are now extinct.\nDot painting.\nDot painting is made up of small dots of paint colours like yellow (representing the sun), brown (the soil), red (desert sand) and white (the clouds and the sky). These are traditional Aboriginal colours. Dot paintings can be painted on anything, including on rocks, in caves, etc. The paintings were mostly images of animals or lakes, and the Dreamtime. Stories and legends were shown on caves and rocks.\nBark painting.\nBark painting is made on sheets of bark from trees. Bark paintings are regarded as fine art, and high prices are often paid for it on the international art markets. The best artists are recognized annually in the National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award.\nAerial desert \"country\" landscapes.\nThis is a kind of maplike, bird's-eye view of the desert landscape. It is often used to tell Dreaming stories. In the distant past, these were made on rock, sand or as body painting. Today they are often colored drawings with liquid based color on canvas (see section Papunya Tula and \"Dot Painting\" above).\nStone arrangements.\nStone arrangements are found across Australia. Some are large, such as the 50m-diameter circles of Victoria, with 1m-high stones buried in the ground. Some are small such as those near Yirrkala which show images of the praus used by Macassan Trepang fishermen and spear throwers.\nSymbols.\nModern Aboriginal art still uses traditional symbols. While the meaning of the symbols can be the same across Australia, they can also change within in a single painting. A symbol such as a circle can be used as a circle within a circle, sometimes on its own or clustered in groups. The meaning can depend on which tribe the artist is from. The circles could be campfires, trees, hills, digging holes, water holes or a spring. The meaning can be changed by the use of colour, so water could be blue or black.\nMany paintings by Aboriginal artists, tell a story from the Dreamtime. These can be drawn like a map. The story shows how the land was created by ancestral beings in their journey or during creation. These paintings continue a tradition of songs, ceremonies, rock art and body art that is thousands of years old.\nWhatever the meaning, interpretations of the symbols should be made in context of the entire painting, the region from which the artist originates, the story behind the painting, and the style of the painting, with additional clues being the colours used in some of the more modern works, such as blue circles signifying water. \nReligious and cultural aspects of Aboriginal art.\nTraditional art almost always is about the Dreamtime of indigenous Australian artists. Wenten Rubuntja, an indigenous landscape artist, says it is hard to find any art that is devoid of spiritual meaning\n\"Doesn't matter what sort of painting we do in this country, it still belongs to the people, all the people. This is worship, work, culture. It's all Dreaming. There are two ways of painting. Both ways are important, because that's culture.\"\u00a0\u2013 source \"The Weekend Australian Magazine\", April 2002\nStory-telling and totem representation feature prominently in all forms of Aboriginal artwork. In some parts of Arnhem Land, the artists used an X-ray style of painting. \nDamage.\nMany important sites of Aboriginal rock paintings have been gradually damaged or destroyed by early settlers and modern-day visitors. Some sites have been cleared or built over. Other sites have been damaged by visitors touching the paint, or graffiti. Many sites are now protected by fences or closed off to the public permanently."}

Mice might spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots could spontaneously appear in meat.\nAccording to Aristotle it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants, fleas from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water, and so forth. In the 17th century these things started to be questioned.\nSir Thomas Browne wrote a book called \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\". He subtitled it \"Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and Commonly Presumed Truths\". He published it in 1646. He wrote it as an attack on \"false beliefs and \"vulgar errors\"\". \nScientists failed to accept the conclusions he reached. For example, Alexander Ross, a scientist who lived at the same time as Browne, wrote about it: \"To question this (he meant: to question spontaneous generation) is to question reason, sense and experience. If he doubts of this let him go to Egypt, and there he will find the fields swarming with mice, begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants.\"\nIn 1546 the physician Girolamo Fracastoro theorized that epidemic diseases were caused by tiny, invisible particles or \"spores\", which might not be living creatures, but this was not widely accepted. Next, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism in 1665. He is also credited for naming the cell which he discovered while observing cork samples.\nIn 1676, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms that were probably protozoa and bacteria. This sparked new interest in the microscopic world. \nThe first step was taken by the Italian Francesco Redi. In 1668, Redi proved that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. From the 17th century onwards it was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be omne vivum ex ovo: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (literally, everything from an egg). \nIn 1768 Lazzaro Spallanzani proved that microbes came from the air, and could be killed by boiling. Yet it was not until 1861 that Louis Pasteur performed a series of careful experiments. With these experiments, Pasteur proved that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not appear in nutrient-rich media of their own accord in non-living material. This experiment supported cell theory."}

He was one of the few members of the gang to die of old age, and not to be killed.\nVane was born at Jerry Plains near Singleton, New South Wales on 28 June 1842. His grandparents had come to Australia as convicts but his father and mother were seen as respectable and wealthy. They lived at Kelso, near Bathurst before moving to Jerry Plains in about 1841. When John was about six years old the family moved back to Kelso and then onto Teasdale Park (Carcoar), near Hobbys Yards. Teasdale Park was owned by George Chesher (Cheshire) who would become Vane's father-in-law. The Vane family moved to Kempfield, near the Abercrombie caves where they stayed for a number of years. John worked as a shepherd and the money he was paid helped his father buy land, probably their Wattle Grove home.\n1850 John Vane and his brother William (Billy) went to work at James Hanrahan's Wentworth Gully Station near the Weddin Mountains. It is not known if all the family went or just the two boys. Billy taught John to ride horses while at Hanrahan's. They stayed there for about a year and returned to the Kempfield district.\nJohn was 14 years when sent to Bathurst, apprenticed to a blacksmith and wheelwright named McDonald. He then went on to the Turon goldfields where he saved a some money before it was stolen from him. He then drove a bullock team between Orange and Lambing Flat (Young).\nHe was described in 1863 as being about six feet tall, with dark hair and a ruddy complexion. He worked as a stockman, looking after cattle and was said to be an excellent horse rider.\nBushranger.\nOn Christmas Eve of 1862 John Vane, Billy Vane, George Chesher Jnr, James Burke and John McKellar were at Boyce's public house at Long Swamp near Trunkey Creek. Warrants were issued for the five youth for robbery of the publican. John Vane hid in the bush and eluded capture until his surrender later that year. The others were captured by police but were released as there was not enough evidence to take them to court [1863 New South Wales Police Gazette].\nJohn Vane and his good mate Micky Burke had built a reputation for providing locals with stolen beef and horses. In July 1863 members of the Ben Hall gang were seeking fresh horses and new places to rob. John Gilbert and John O'Meally came to the Carcoar district and sent out word that they needed Vane's local knowledge and skills. The pair met with Vane at his camp at Millpost Creek and laid plans for an attack on the Carcoar bank. On 30 July 1863 that plan was put into action. Vane had provided information and support for the raid, though he did not participate. Gilbert and O'Meally rode into town and performed the first daylight bank robbery in Australia. Vane joined the gang and soon after so did his mate Micky Burke.\nBen Hall joined the other members of the gang and they began stealing around the district. They bailed up store owners and gold buyers. They held the town of Canowindra and all its people prisoner for three days. They tied the pursuing police troopers to trees and took their uniforms and weapons. They raided the large town of Bathurst and which sent the colonial government into turmoil.\nThe excitiment and adventure came to a tragic end when on the afternoon of 24 October 1863, the gang went to the home of Gold Commissioner Henry Keightley at Dunn's Plains, near Rockley. At the house were Mrs. Keightley, house staff and Dr. Pechey. During the gun battle Vane's mate Micky Burke was shot in the stomach, and through fear of being caught by police decided to shoot himself. There is still debate today around who actually shot Burke. Vane was enraged and wanted to kill Keightley in revenge. It was decided though that the ransom Keightley would receive for killing Burke (\u20a4500)should be sought by the gang. Keightley's wife and Dr Pechey rode to Bathurst that night to get the money from Mrs Keightley's father, Henry Rotton. Pechey and Rotton returned the next morning and the money was handed to Gilbert. Keightley was immediately released. The story of the ride was later turned into a stage play. Many people say that John Vane is a handsome, old, lad but hated him dearly.\nSurrender.\nIn November 1863 a priest, Father Tim M'Carthy met Vane by chance in the bush. He later met the bushranger's mother. They talked Vane into giving himself up. It is said that John, cried and cried. His Father and mother knew how he felt! They gave him some food and money and told him sternly that a life as a bushranger was not good. He eventually decided that there was no point continuing to hide, so he walked off with shredded pants and shirt. He went with the priest to Nathaniel Connolly's home, who supplied them with a letter to secure Vane's passage to Bathurst courthouse. Vane was sentenced to 15 years at Darlinghurst and released after six for good behavior.\nLater life.\nHe drove the mail coach between Carcoar and Mt Donald until retiring. Vane continued to be in trouble with the police. In 1880 the newspapers reported that John Vane, ex-bushranger, was in court at Bathurst, for stealing 431 sheep. A friend, Terence M'Cann who had helped steal the sheep, was the main witness. John Vane's brother-in-law, Thomas Parker, tried to stop M'Cann from giving evidence. He was put in gaol for 12 months.\nJohn Vane died of Ileocolitis in the hospital at Cowra, New South Wales on January 30, 1906.\nJohn was a known bushranger in the 1800's because of all the big and small things he stole. He was also a help to the police in controlling, pubs, roads and the like. Although it wasn't his intention he inadvertently made these places better today! \nHe made gold diggers and people around the gold fields more aware of robbers and bushranger."}

It is like the way in which electricity is sent to users: they simply use the electricity that is sent to them and do not need to worry where the electricity is from or how it is made and brought to them. Every month, they pay only for what they used and nothing more. The idea behind cloud computing is similar: The user can simply use storage, computing power, or development environments, without having to worry how they work behind the scenes.\nThe cloud is a metaphor for the Internet based on how it is described in computer network diagrams. Just as how in the real world, clouds hide parts of the sky from sight, the \"cloud\" in computing hides the complex infrastructure that makes the Internet work. It is a type of computing in which IT-related actions are provided \u201cas a service\u201d, allowing users to access these services through the Internet (\"in the \"cloud\"\"). They do not have to know or control the technologies behind them, preventing them from running into ethical and legal problems.\nAccording to the IEEE, cloud computing is a concept where information is placed on servers and sent over the Internet to other devices, such as computers, laptops, handhelds, and sensors. It includes the idea of having software as a service (SaaS), such as Web 2.0, that depend on the Internet to meet the needs of their users. For example, Google has made several office suite apps which are accessed from a web browser. Unlike other software that does the same tasks, including Microsoft Office, the software and data are stored on Google's servers, not on the machine in which they are used.\nBrief.\nComparisons.\nCloud computing is often confused with other ideas:\nCloud computing often uses grid computing, has autonomic characteristics and is billed like utilities, but cloud computing can be seen as a \"natural next step\" from the \"grid-utility model\". Some successful cloud architectures have little or no centralised infrastructure or billing systems including peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent and Skype.\nPower BI Certification.\nPower BI, the latest business intelligence product by Microsoft, is covered in depth in the Microsoft Power BI Training, which was developed to aid people in dynamic learning about the latest business intelligence tool by Microsoft. This training introduces new learners to more advanced concepts, including data kinds, generation, and exploration, as well as adding slicers, optimizing data, and charting, to name a few. In this course, you'll learn how to leverage Microsoft Power BI Certification to effectively understand and communicate analytics and data visualization.\nArchitecture.\nThe majority of cloud computing infrastructure currently consists of reliable services delivered through data centers that are built on computer and storage virtualization technologies. The services are accessible anywhere in the world, with \"The Cloud\" appearing as a single point of access for all the computing needs of consumers. Commercial offerings need to meet the quality of service requirements of customers and typically offer service level agreements. Open standards and open source software are also critical to the growth of cloud computing.\nCharacteristics.\nAs customers generally do not own the infrastructure or know all details about it, mainly they are accessing or renting, so they can consume resources as a service, and may be paying for what they do not need, instead of what they actually do need to use. Many cloud computing providers use the utility computing model which is analogous to how traditional public utilities like electricity are consumed, while others are billed on a subscription basis. By sharing consumable and \"intangible\" computing power between multiple \"tenants\", utilization rates can be improved (as servers are not left idle) which can reduce costs significantly while increasing the speed of application development.\nA side effect of this approach is that \"computer capacity rises dramatically\" as customers do not have to engineer for peak loads. Adoption has been enabled by \"increased high-speed bandwidth\" which makes it possible to receive the same response times from centralized infrastructure at other sites.\nProviders.\nCloud computing is being driven by providers including Google, Amazon.com, and Yahoo! as well as traditional vendors including IBM, Intel, Microsoft and SAP. It can adopted by all kinds of users, be they individuals or large enterprises. Most internet users are currently using cloud services, even if they do not realize it. Webmail for example is a cloud service, as are Facebook and Wikipedia and contact list synchronization and online data backups.\nHistory.\n\"The Cloud\" is a metaphor for the Internet, or more generally components and services which are managed by others.\nThe underlying concept dates back to 1960 when expressed his opinion that \"computation may someday be organized as a public utility\" and the term \"Cloud\" was already in commercial use in the early 1990s to refer to large ATM networks. By the turn of the 21st century, cloud computing solutions had started to appear on the market, though most of the focus at this time was on Software as a service.\nAmazon.com played a key role in the development of cloud computing when upgrading their data centers after the dot-com bubble and providing access to their systems by way of Amazon Web Services in 2002 on a basis. They found the new cloud architecture resulted in significant internal efficiency improvements.\n2007 observed increased activity, including Google, IBM and a number of universities starting large scale \"cloud computing\" research project, around the time the term started gaining popularity in the mainstream press. It was a hot topic by mid-2008 and numerous cloud computing events had been scheduled.\nIn August 2008 Gartner observed that \"organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models\" and that the \"projected shift to cloud computing will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas\".\nPolitical issues.\n\"Clouds\" cross many country borders and \"may be the ultimate form of globalisation\". As such it is the subject of complex geopolitical issues, whereby providers must satisfy many legal restrictions in order to deliver service to a global market. This dates back to the early days of the Internet, where libertarian thinkers felt that \"cyberspace was a distinct place calling for laws and legal institutions of its own\"; author Neal Stephenson envisaged this as a tiny island data haven in his science-fiction classic novel Cryptonomicon.\nAlthough there have been efforts to match the legal environment (such as US-EU Safe Harbor), providers like Amazon Web Services usually deal with international markets (typically the United States and European Union) by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select their countries. However, there are still concerns about security and privacy for individual through various governmental levels, (for example the USA PATRIOT Act and use of national security letters and title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Stored Communications Act).\nLegal issues.\nIn March 2007, Dell applied to trademark the term '\"cloud computing\" in the United States. It received a \"Notice of Allowance\" in July 2008 which was subsequently canceled on August 6, resulting in a formal rejection of the trademark application in less than a week later.\nIn November 2007, the Free Software Foundation released the Affero General Public License (abbreviated as Affero GPL and AGPL), a version of GPLv3 designed to close a perceived legal loophole associated with Free software designed to be run over a network, particularly software as a service. According to the AGPL license application service providers are required to release any changes they make to an AGPL open source code.\nArchitecture.\n\"Cloud architecture\" is the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of \"cloud computing\" (e.g. hardware, software) as designed by a \"cloud architect\" who typically works for a \"cloud integrator\". It typically involves multiple \"cloud components\" communicating with each other over application programming interfaces (usually web services).\nThis is very similar to the Unix philosophy of having multiple programs doing one thing well and working together over universal interfaces. Complexity is controlled and the resulting systems are more manageable than their monolithic counterparts.\n\"Cloud architecture\" extends to the client where web browsers and/or software applications are used to access \"cloud applications\".\n\"Cloud storage architecture\" is loosely coupled where metadata operations are centralized enabling the data nodes to scale into the hundreds, each independently delivering data to applications or users.\nComponents.\nApplication.\nA \"cloud application\" influences The Cloud model of software architecture, often eliminating the need to install and run the application on the customer's own computer, thus reducing software maintenance, ongoing operations, and support. For example:\nClient.\nA \"cloud client\" is computer hardware and/or computer software which relies on The Cloud for application delivery, or which is specifically designed for delivery of cloud services, and which is in either case essentially useless without a Cloud. For example:\nInfrastructure.\n\"Cloud infrastructure\" (e.g. Infrastructure as a service) is the delivery of computer infrastructure (typically a platform virtualization environment) as a service. For example:\nPlatform.\nA \"cloud platform\" (e.g. Platform as a service) (the delivery of a computing platform and/or solution stack as a service) facilitates deployment of applications without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. For example:\nService.\nA \"cloud service\" (e.g. Web Service) is \"software system[s] designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network\" which may be accessed by other cloud computing components, software (e.g. Software plus services) or end users directly. For example:\nStorage.\n\"Cloud storage\" is the delivery of data storage as a service (including database-like services), often billed on a utility computing basis (e.g. per gigabyte per month). For example:\nTraditional storage vendors have recently begun to offer their own flavor of cloud storage, sometimes in conjunction with their existing software products (e.g. Symantec's Online Storage for Backup Exec ). Others focus on providing a new kind of back-end storage optimally designed for delivering cloud storage (EMC's Atmos), categorically known as Cloud Optimized Storage.\nRoles.\nProvider.\nA \"cloud computing provider\" or \"cloud computing service provider\" owns and operates \"cloud computing\" systems serve someone else. Usually this needs building and managing new data centers. Some organisations get some of the benefits of cloud computing by becoming \"internal\" cloud providers and servicing themselves, though they do not benefit from the same economies of scale and still have to engineer for peak loads. The barrier to entry is also significantly higher with capital expenditure required and billing and management creates some overhead. However, significant operational efficiency and quickness advantages can be achieved even by small organizations, and server consolidation and virtualization rollouts are already in progress. Amazon.com was the first such provider, modernising its data centers which, like most computer networks were using as little as 10% of its capacity at any one time just to leave room for occasional spikes. They opened it up to outsiders as Amazon Web Services in 2002 on a utility computing basis.\nA user is a consumer of \"cloud computing\". The privacy of users in cloud computing has become of increasing concern. The rights of users is also an issue, which is being addressed via a community effort to create a bill of rights (currently in draft).\nVendor.\nA vendor sells products and services that facilitate the delivery, adoption and use of \"cloud computing\". For example:\nStandards.\nA \"cloud standard\" is one of a number of existing (typically lightweight) open standards that have facilitated the growth of cloud computing, including:"}

The tree \"Pimenta dioica\" is from the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), and it is very valued for its berries. The allspice was named because the flavor of the berry is like a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It is used very much in baking, mostly for making mincemeat and mixed pickling spice. It was discovered first by the early Spanish explorers, who mistook it for a type of pepper.\nAllspice is the only spice grown in the Western Hemisphere. But after that, the wild trees were cut down to get the berries and only a few allspice are left. There are many plantations in Mexico and Central America, too. However, the best allspice comes from Jamaica where the weather and soil are best for the berries.\nHistory.\nAllspice was used by the Mayans and by other South American Indians when making chocolate. The name \"Jamaica\" comes from Xamayca. This means \u2018land of wood and water\u2019 in the language of the Arawaks. The Arawaks used allspice to help keep the meat from rotting, or sometimes against their enemies.\nThe spice was imported to Europe after it was discovered. There were many tries to plant it in the East, but it did not work because the trees could not give a lot of fruit. Even though it had a rich smell and a tasty flavor, allspice never had the same cach\u00e9 in Europe as cinnamon or pepper. The English started taking the spice by ship to England in 1737, but by that time the want for spices had been taken over by other kinds of products such as sugar and coffee. It was still a little popular in England though, where it came to be known as the \"English Spice\".\nIn the Napoleonic war of 1812, Russian soldiers put the spice in their boots to keep their feet warm. Because of this, today the pimento oil from the allspice is usually used for the men\u2019s dress.\nDescription.\nDried allspice berries look like large brown peppercorns and their colors are cocoa brown. When the berries are not yet ripe, they are harvested and dried by the sun. They are different in size from between 4 and 7 mm (1/8 - 1/4 in) in diameter and are dark brown. Their skin is very wrinkled, and the outer case has two seeds. Allspice can be eaten ground or whole.\nStorage.\nWhole dried allspice can keep without a time limit if they are properly kept in airtight jars. They also must not face the light. It can be ground in a mill or an electric coffee grinder. After it is ground, the spice loses its flavor in a few days."}

In written communication, Morse code uses \"dots\" and \"dashes\" to represent a limited number of alphabet letters, numbers, punctuation and special characters of a given message. When messages are sent by sound, radio signals or light flashes, dots are short beeps or clicks or flashes, and dashes are longer ones.\nMorse code is named after Samuel Morse, who helped invent it. It is not used as much today as it was in the 19th and 20th centuries. Teletypewriters were invented in the early 20th century with their own codes and gradually replaced Morse code. Other types of technology that are easier to use for communication became even more common. \nSome amateur radio operators still use Morse code to communicate and were previously required to learn and pass telegraphy exams to qualify their licenses. The requirements were lifted after 2003. \nThere are different types of Morse code for some different countries. \nThere are three different symbols in Morse code; there's a short one, usually called 'dit', a long one, called 'dah', and the pause. A dah is three times as long as a dit, and the pause has the same length as the dit.\nToday, Morse codes can be easily generated through smartphone applications or through a web application, which take text as input and outputs the Morse code in copyable text or downloadable audio form. Its usage as a method of sending secret messages has become obsolete in favor of more powerful encryption techniques provided by advanced modern computer machines.\nDifferent ways to send Morse code.\nMorse code can be sent in different ways. On ships, flickering lights were often used instead of radio communication.\nThe history of the S.O.S.\nThe S.O.S as it is used today, was introduced by the Imperial German Marine in 1904. It was mandatory for all German ships starting in 1905. It was meant as a distress signal, and should be repeated until all other stations stopped sending. Afterwards the real message would be sent. Also, there is no pause between the characters. \nAt the time, the market was controlled by two companies; one was Telefunken, and the other was Marconi. Marconi was under British control, Telefunken was German. Marconi used CQD as a distress signal. \nThe people doing the communication were employees of either Marconi or Telefunken; they were not employed by the ships' owners. These operators were not allowed to answer calls sent by the competing company, which also included distress signals. As this was against the laws of the sea, a conference in Berlin decided to use the German distress signal internationally. This started in 1908. When the ship Republic sent a distress signal in 1909, it was still CQD, and the Titanic also sent CQD at first, in 1912. \nThe first ship to use the new signal was the RMS Slavonia, in 1909.\nReplacing the S.O.S signal.\nThe Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) is a satellite-based system that was introduced in 1999 to handle distress situations. It defines four different regions, three of which are covered by satellite. The fourth, which covers the polar regions, is covered by shortwave radio. With the introduction of GMDSS, the S.O.S signal is no longer used."}

{"id": "142002", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142002", "title": "Komodo dragon", "text": "The Komodo dragon (\"Varanus komodoensis\") is a species of lizard that lives in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rincah, Flores, Gili Motang, and Gili Dasami. It is the largest living lizard. They grow to an average length of 2\u20133\u00a0meters (approximately 6.5\u201310\u00a0ft) and weigh around 70\u00a0kg (154 pounds). Komodo dragon bites can be very dangerous, and they sometimes attack people.\nWestern scientists first saw Komodo dragons in 1910. They are very popular animals in zoos because they are very big and look scary. The lizards are in some danger. There are very few Komodo dragons still alive on their home islands. Indonesian law does not allow hunting these lizards. Komodo National Park was made to help protect Komodo dragons.\nThe Komodo dragon has other names. It can also be called the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor by some scientists, but this is not very common. The people who live in Komodo Island call them \"ora\", \"buaja durat\" (land crocodile) or \"biawak raksasa\" (giant monitor).\nDescription.\nThe Komodo dragon is cold-blooded. Its tail is as long as its body. It has about 60 sharp teeth that can grow up to 2.5 centimeters (1\u00a0inch) long. It also has a long, yellow, forked tongue. Its skin can be blue, orange, green, gray, or brown. Its saliva is red because its gums almost completely cover its teeth. When they eat, their teeth cut their gums and make them bleed. This creates a good environment for the dangerous bacteria that live in its mouth.\nSize.\nThese lizards are the top predators in the places where they live because they are so big.\nPeople used to think they were very big because there are no other large, meat-eating animals on the islands where they live. Therefore they did not have to compete with other similar animals for the same food and places to live. People also thought they were big because of their low metabolic rate.\nHowever, facts are different. The fossil record shows that the Komodo is the last of a group of lizards called varanids. These lizards have been about the same size for nearly a million years. They had their origin in Australia nearly four million years ago, and spread later to much of Indonesia. Their size has nothing to do with being on a relatively small island.\nMost of them died out after contact with the \nmodern humans.\nSenses.\nThe Komodo dragon's earholes are easy to see, but Komodo dragons are not very good at hearing. It is able to see as far away as 300 meters (985\u00a0feet), but it is thought to have poor night vision. The Komodo dragon is able to see in color, but has trouble seeing objects that do not move.\nThe Komodo dragon uses its tongue to taste and smell like many other reptiles. They have a special part of the body called the Jacobson's organ for smelling. With the help of a good wind, they can smell dead animals from 4\u20139.5\u00a0kilometres (2.5\u20136\u00a0mi) away. The Komodo dragon's nostrils are not very useful for smelling, because it does not have a diaphragm. It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat. Its scales have special connections to nerves that give the lizard a sense of touch. The scales around its ears, lips, chin, and bottoms of the feet may have three or more of these connections.\nSaliva.\nKomodo dragons have dangerous bacteria in their saliva. Scientists have identified 57 of them. One of the most dangerous bacteria in Komodo dragon saliva appears to be a kind of \"Pasteurella multocida\". These bacteria cause disease in the blood of their victim. If a bite does not kill an animal and it escapes, it will usually die within a week from infection. The Komodo dragon seems to never get sick from its own bacteria. So, researchers have been looking for the lizard's antibacterial. This may be used as medicine for humans.\nIn addition to the deadly bacteria, the Komodo dragon has venom glands in its lower jaws which match the potency of the inland taipan, a venomous snake. The venom acts as a blood thinner, and will cause death by heart failure and massive internal bleeding in as little as 30 minutes.\nReproduction.\nMating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. Dragons leave about twenty eggs in empty nests left by birds called megapodes. The eggs develop for seven to eight months. The eggs open and the baby lizards come out in April, when there are many insects to eat. Young Komodo dragons live in trees, where they are safe from adult Komodo dragons and other animals that might eat them. They take around three to five years to mature and may live as long as fifty years. Female Komodo dragons can have babies without fertilisation (parthenogenesis).\nHabitat.\nThe Komodo dragon likes hot and dry places and lives in dry open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest on lower land. It is most active in the day because it is cold-blooded, although it is sometimes active at night. Komodo dragons live alone. They come together only to breed and eat. They can run up to 20 kilometers per hour (12.4\u00a0mph), dive up to 4.5 metres (15\u00a0ft) at top speed for short periods of time. When they are young, they climb trees with their strong claws. As the Komodo dragon grows bigger, its claws are used mostly as weapons, because it is too big to climb trees well.\nThe Komodo dragon digs holes for protection with its powerful legs and claws. These holes can be from 1\u20133\u00a0metres (3\u201310\u00a0ft) wide.\nBecause it is very big and sleeps in holes, it is able to keep itself warm through the night. The Komodo dragon usually hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day. Komodo dragons have special resting places on ridges that catch cool sea breezes.\nFood.\nKomodo dragons are carnivores, which means that they eat meat. Although they eat mostly dead animals they will also catch live animals as prey. When prey goes by a Komodo dragon, it will suddenly charge at the animal and bite or claw the belly or the throat. To catch animals that are up high and out of reach, the Komodo dragon may stand on its back legs and use its tail as a support.\nKomodo dragons do not chew their food. They eat by biting and pulling off large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole. They can swallow smaller prey, up to the size of a goat, whole. This is because they have flexible jaws and skulls, and their stomachs can expand. Komodo dragons make much saliva to help the food move easily, but swallowing still takes a long time (15\u201320\u00a0minutes to swallow a goat). Komodo dragons may try to swallow faster by running and pushing the dead animal in its mouth very hard against a tree. Sometimes a lizard hits the tree so hard that it gets knocked out. Dragons breathe using a small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs. This allows it to continue breathing even while swallowing large things. Komodo dragons can eat up to 80\u00a0percent of its body weight in one meal. After swallowing its food, it drags itself to a sunny place to speed up digestion so the food does not rot and poison the dragon. Large dragons can survive on as little as 12 meals a year. After digestion, the Komodo dragon vomits the horns, hair, and teeth of the animal it ate. This vomit is covered in a smelly mucus. After vomiting, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus. This suggests that komodo dragons dislike the smell, just like humans do.\nThe largest animals usually eat first, while the smaller ones eat later. Dragons of equal size may wrestle each other. Losers usually run away, although sometimes they are chased and eaten by the winners.\nThe Komodo dragon's diet includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boars, goats, deer, horses, and water buffalo. Young Komodo dragons will eat insects, eggs, geckoes, and small mammals. Komodo dragons may eat people and, they can even dig up bodies from their graves to eat them. Therefore, people on Komodo Island moved their graves from sandy to clay ground and piled rocks on top to stop the lizards from digging up dead bodies.\nBecause the Komodo dragon does not have a diaphragm, it cannot suck water when drinking. It cannot lap water with its tongue either. Instead, it drinks by taking a mouthful of water, lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.\nEvolutionary history.\nRecent fossils from Queensland suggests that the Komodo dragon evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia. Its body size remained stable on Flores, ever since the islands were isolated by rising sea levels, about 900,000 years ago. The sea level dropped very low during the last ice age and uncovered wide areas of continental shelf. The Komodo dragon spread into these areas. They became isolated on the islands where they live today when sea levels rose again. They moved into what is now the Indonesian island group. They spread as far east as the island of Timor. \nKomodo dragons and people.\nIn zoos.\nKomodo dragons have been popular in zoos for a long time. However, there are few of them in zoos because they may become sick and do not have babies easily. As of May 2009, there are 13 European, 2 African, 35 North American, 1 Singaporean, and 2 Australian institutions that keep Komodo dragons.\nA Komodo dragon was shown in a zoo for the first time in 1934 at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. But, it lived for only two years. People continued to try to keep Komodo dragons in zoos, but the lives of these creatures was very short. The average life of a dragon in a zoo was five years in the National Zoological Park. Walter Auffenberg studied the dragons in zoos and eventually helped zoos to keep dragons more successfully.\nMany dragons in zoos may become tamer than wild lizards within a short period of time in a zoo. Many zoo keepers have brought the animals out of their cages to meet visitors without any problems. Dragons can also recognize individual humans. However, even dragons that seem tame may surprise people and become aggressive. This can often happen when a stranger enters the animal's home.\nResearch with captive Komodo dragons has shown that they play. One dragon would push a shovel left and seemed attracted to the sound of it moving across rocks. A young female dragon at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. would grab and shake things like statues, drink cans, plastic rings, and blankets. She would also put her head in boxes, shoes, and other objects. She did not make a mistake and think these objects were food; she would only swallow them if they were covered in rat blood.\nDanger to humans.\nKomodo dragons do not attack humans very often. However, they do sometimes hurt or kill people.\nIn June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously hurt Phil Bronstein\u2014executive editor of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". Bronstein had entered the dragon's cage at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. The zoo keeper had told him to take off his white shoes, which could have excited the Komodo dragon. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot. Although he escaped, he needed surgery to repair his foot.\nOn June 4, 2007, a Komodo dragon attacked an eight-year-old boy on Komodo Island. The boy later died because he lost too much blood. This was the first time that people know a dragon had killed a human in 33 years. Local people blamed the attack on environmentalists. People from outside the island had stopped local people from killing goats and leaving them for the dragons. The Komodo dragons no longer found the food they needed, so they came into places where humans lived in search of food. Many natives of Komodo Island believe that Komodo dragons are actually the reincarnation of relatives and should be treated with respect.\nOn March 24, 2009, two Komodo dragons attacked and killed fisherman Muhamad Anwar on Komodo Island. They attacked Anwar after he fell out of a sugar-apple tree. He was bleeding badly from bites on his hands, body, legs, and neck. He was taken to a clinic on the nearby island of Flores, but doctors said he was dead when he arrived.\nProtecting Komodo dragons.\nThere are very few Komodo dragons, and they may not survive. The lizards are on the IUCN Red List of animals in danger. Not many Komodo dragons still live on their home islands.\nHowever, there may now be only 352 females having babies in the wild. The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon on its home islands.\nMany things have reduced the number of dragons, including: volcanoes, earthquakes, loss of good places to live, fire, not enough animals to eat, tourism, and illegal hunting.\nBuying or selling Komodo dragons or their skins is illegal as part of an international law called CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species)."}

In British English, the term \"postgraduate student\" is more common.\nA graduate school is not always a separate school.\nThe term \"graduate school\" could be confusing because the verb \"graduate\" is also used to mean completing high school education or earning a Bachelor's degree. The verb is used for all those types of schools, but the meaning of the adjective \"graduate\" is changed to mean \"postgraduate\" in the term \"graduate school\". The small change in meaning can be viewed with an air of sophistication, where experienced students are often more aware of the issue, while novice students might not be aware, as being more naive."}

The SAT is owned, published, and created by the College Board, a non-profit organization in the United States, and was once owned by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). ETS now administers the exam. The SAT is usually taken by high school juniors and seniors.\nAs of March 5, 2016, the College Board has begun using a new SAT, which has four sections (reading, writing, math without calculator, math with calculator) plus an optional essay. \nThe reading section comes first. It is 65 minutes long, and has 52 questions. Unlike on the pre-2016 SAT, there are no vocabulary words or sentences to fill in.\nThe writing section, which is 35 minutes long and has 44 questions, comes next. It is similar to the old writing section.\nThe math section is split into two parts: one which lets students use calculators, and one which does not. The no-calculator section comes before the calculator section, and has 20 problems to be finished in 25 minutes. The calculator section has 38 problems to be done in 55 minutes.\nFinally, the essay is 50 minutes long, but does not have to be taken by every student. The new essay is based on analyzing a passage, instead of answering a question about life experiences.\nScores on the new SAT range from 400 to 1600, as on the pre-2005 SAT.\nOlder versions.\nBefore 2005.\nOn the old SAT administered before 2005, the top score was 1600. The two sections were Critical Reading and Mathematics. The scores in each area ranged from 200 to 800, 800 being the best score. The two scores were added together.\nFrom 2005 to 2016.\nFrom 2005 to 2016, the SAT had questions in three areas: Critical Reading, Mathematics, and Writing. Writing included a new essay section. The scores in each area go from 200 to 800, 800 being the best score. The scores in the three areas are added up, for a score between 600 and 2400. The average score is about 1500 in total. Getting near the highest or lowest scores is rare.\nThe test had ten sections, with the essay always coming first. There is also a section that is not scored. College Board said:\nThe sections are mostly 25 minutes long, but the later sections start to get shorter, with fewer questions. The whole test lasted 3 hours and 45 minutes.\nRelated tests.\nThe PSAT is also fee-based, and is practice for the real SAT.\nThe NMSQT is the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. It's a qualifying test for the National Merit Scholarship Program.\nThe SAT Subject Tests were one hour long tests in mathematics, science, history, English, and foreign languages. They were all multiple choice and scores ranged from 200 to 800 points. No subject tests will be held after June 2021."}

Sexual dimorphism is inherited, which means the differences between males and females help the animal stay alive in some way.\nThe things that make the two sexes of a species different are called secondary sex characteristics. They are not directly part of the reproductive system. They are the product of sexual selection for traits that give an animal an advantage over others in staying alive and reproduction. In humans, beards are a secondary sex characteristic. Human beings do not use beards to make babies. A man can even shave off his beard and he will still be able to have children. But men grow beards and women do not, and they are easy to see.\nThe difference between sexes can include:\nThe main functions of sexual dimorphism are to improve the individual's chance of mating in various ways:\nSome animals show these differences only during mating season. Deer shed their antlers and peacocks shed their tails out of season. This minimises the key disadvantage of sexual dimorphism, which is, it makes the male much easier to be seen by predators."}

{"id": "142144", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142144", "title": "Kavirondo", "text": "Kavirondo is the old name of the region around Kavirondo Gulf (now Winam Gulf) as well as of two native peoples living there under the regime of British East Africa (The \"Nilotic Kavirondo\" and the \"Bantu Kavirondo\"). Broadly, this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the Nzoia River, on the western slopes of Mount Elgon, and along the northeast coast of Victoria Nyanza. \nSuggested origins of the name \"Kavirondo\" include \nOrigins and divisions.\nKavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of tribes: The Bantu immigrated from the south and the other Nilotic, came from the north. The Bantu appear to have been the first. The Nilotic tribes are probably an offshoot of the Acholi. They appear to have crossed the lake to reach their current home, the country around Kavirondo Gulf. Of the two groups the Bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors, and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race (Hobley). Their further progress north was stopped by the southward movement of the Nilotic tribes, while the Nilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of Elgumi people (themselves probably of Nilotic origin) from the east. \nThe Bantu Kavirondo are divided into three principal types: the Awa-Rimi, the Awa-Ware and the Awa-Kisii. Their Bantu neighbors call the Nilotic Kavirondo \"Ja-Mwa\". The generic name for the Nilotic tribes is \"Ja-Luo\", but the Bantu Kavirondo call them \"Awa-Nyoro\". The two groups have many characteristics in common. \nThe Kavirondo have many tribes, divided, Sir H. H. Johnston suspects, totemically.\nCulture and society.\nTraditionally, these people seem to be naked. The men of the Nilotic Kavirondo start to wear a small piece of goat-skin on their penis when they become fathers. This is called \"Sembe\". Even though this covering is practically useless as a covering, ettiquette says it must still be worn. Even those men who wear clothes must wear the goat-skin, when they are fathers. \nMen of the tribe have traveled more, and have had more contact with white people. Some of the tribesmen now wear European-style clothing. Women traveled less, or were more conservative. They kept the nudity, or the few garments they had before.\nAmong the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fiber suspended from a girdle behind. This tassel looks like a tail from a distance. The first travelers to Africa talked about a \"tailed race\". The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but not the fringe in front. For dandy they wear a goat-skin slung over the shoulders. \nSome of the Bantu tribes practice circumcision, the Nilotic tribes do not. Patterns are tattooed on chest and stomach for ornament. Men, even husbands, are forbidden to touch the women's tails, which must be worn even should any other clothing be wrapped round the body. \nThe Kavirondo are known for being independent, eager, and ready to fight. They are seen as honest, and as having a high sexual morality, traits common among the Bantu tribes. There are more women than men. For this reason, polygamy is common.\nAmong the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters of his wife as they attain puberty. Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life, for if no suitor seeks her, she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price, an offer usually accepted, as the women are excellent agricultural laborers. The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to exogamy, endeavoring always to marry outside their clan. Girls are betrothed at six or seven, and the husband-elect continually makes small presents to his father-in-law-elect till the bride reaches womanhood. It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day. She is sent back to her parents, who have to return the marriage price, and pay a fine. The wife's adultery was formerly punished with death, and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young men and girls guilty of adultery. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual minimum price for a wife is forty hoes, twenty goats and one cow, paid in installments. The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows; the husband-elect can claim his bride after half payment; if a woman dies without bearing children, the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father, unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister. The women are prolific and the birth of twins is common and considered a lucky event, which is celebrated by feasting and dances. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must remain in her hut for seven days; among the Nilotic Kavirondo the parents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month. If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession, the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road, where it is left till a neighbor, usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose, picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return; a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Niotic tribes. Names are not male and female, and a daughter often bears her fathers name.\nThe Kavirondo bury their dead. Among one of the Bantu tribes, the Awa-Kisesa, a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting position, but at such a depth that the head protrudes. Over the head an earthenware pot is placed, and his principal wives have to remain in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes, when the skull is removed and buried close to the hut. Later the skeleton is unearthed, and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place of the tribe. Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up, the hut being then deserted. Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the veranda of the hut. Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open space in the midst of their huts; in the Nilotic tribes, if the first wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut, if not, beneath the veranda of the hut in which he died. A child is buried near the door of its mothers hut. A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fiber worn round the neck and waist.\nA chief chooses, sometimes years before his death, one of his sons to succeed him, often giving a brass bracelet as insignia. A man's property is divided equally among his children.\nWhile some tribes live in isolated huts, those in the north have strongly walled villages. The walls are of mud and formerly, among the Nilotic tribes, occasionally of stone. Since colonization by the British the security of the country induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into disrepair. Their huts are circular with conical thatched roofs, and fairly broad verandas all round.\nA portion of the hut is partitioned off as a sleeping-place for goats, and the fowls sleep indoors in a large basket. Skins form the only bedsteads. In each hut are two fireplaces, about which a rigid etiquette prevails. Strangers or distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first, which is near the door, and is used for cooking. At the second, which is nearly in the middle of the hut, sits the hut owner, his wives, children, brothers and sisters. Around this fireplace the family sleep.\nCooking pots, water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other furniture. The food is served in small baskets. Every full-grown man has a hut to himself, and one for each wife. The huts of the Masaba Kavirondo of west Elgon have the apex of the roof surmounted by a carved pole which Sir H. H. Johnston says is obviously a phallus. Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons, nor do brothers eat together. Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat together, usually in a separate hut with open sides. Women eat apart and only after the men have finished. \nThough a peaceful people the Kavirondo fight well. Their weapons are spears with rather long flat blades without blood-courses and broad-bladed swords. Some use slings, and most carry shields. Bows and arrows are also used; firearms are however displacing other weapons. Kavirondo warfare was mainly defensive and intertribal, this last a form of vendetta. When a man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return and was rubbed with medicine (generally goats dung), to defend him from the spirit of the dead man. The Awa-Wanga abandoned this custom when they obtained firearms. The young warriors were made to stab the bodies of their slain enemies. \nIn the colonial era the Kavirondo are on the increase due to their fecundity and morality. Those who live in the low-lying lands suffer from a mild malaria, while abroad they are subject to dysentery and pneumonia. Epidemics of small-pox have occurred. Native medicine is of the simplest. They dress wounds with butter and leaves, and for inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy, pierce a hole in the chest. There are no medicine-men: the women are the doctors. Certain of the incisor teeth are pulled out. If a man retains these he will, it is thought, be killed in warfare. Among certain tribes the women also have incisor teeth extracted, otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands. For the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach. A Kavirondo husband, before starting on a perilous journey, cuts scars on his wife's body to ensure him good luck.\nOf dances, the Kavirondo have the birth dance, the death dance, that at initiation and one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought. Their music is plaintive and sometimes pretty, produced by a large lyre-shaped instrument. They also use various drums.\nThe Ja-Luo women use small beads attached to pieces of brass for ear ornaments. Like the aggry beads of West Africa these beads are not of local manufacture nor of recent introduction. They are ancient, generally blue in color, occasionally yellow or green, and are picked up in certain districts after heavy rain. The natives believe they come down with the rain. They are identical in shape and color to ancient Egyptian beads and other beads obtained from ancient cities in Baluchistan.\nReligion and beliefs.\nThey appears to practice a vague ancestor worship, but the northern tribes have two gods, Awafwa and Ishishemi, the spirits of good and evil. To the former, cattle and goats are sacrificed. \nThe Kavirondo have great faith in divination from the entrails of a sheep. Nearly everybody and everything are ominous of good or evil to the Kavirondo. \nThey have few myths or traditions; the antbear is the chief figure in their beast-legends. \nThey believe in witchcraft and practice trial by ordeal.\nEconomy.\nThe Kavirondo are essentially an agricultural people: both men and women work in the fields with large iron hoes. In addition to sorghum, Eleusine and maize, tobacco and hemp are both cultivated and smoked. Both sexes smoke, but the use of hemp is restricted to men and unmarried women, as it is thought to injure child-bearing women. Hemp is smoked in a hubble-bubble. The Kavirondo cultivate sesamum and make an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps of the ancient saucer type, the pattern being, in Hobley's opinion, introduced into the country by the coast people. \nThe Kavirondo keep cattle, sheep, goats, fowls and a few dogs. Women do not eat sheep, fowls or eggs, and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other things. The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of the tribes. Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated, the snout being held until the animal dies. From Eleusine a beer is made. \nThe Kavirondo are plucky hunters, capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps, and attacking with spears the largest elephants. Fish, of which they are very fond, are caught by line and rod or in traps. Bee-keeping is common, and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of the hut. \nTraditional Kavirondo industries are salt-making, effected by burning reeds and water-plants and passing water through the ashes; the smelting of iron ore (confined to the Bantu tribes); pottery and basket-work."}

Clement VII commissioned the painting in 1534, the last year of his papacy. After the election of Paul III Farnese, Michelangelo, aged 61, began work in 1536. He completed the Last Judgement in the autumn of 1541. \nThe Last Judgment shows the Second Coming of Christ, as described by John the Evangelist in the apocalypse. The painting depicts the moment when the living and dead are judged by Christ, and their souls consigned to heaven or hell.\nThe painting was not unanimously admired at the time. Due to his depiction of holy persons in the nude, with exposed genitals, Michelangelo was accused of immorality and obscenity. The cardinal said that this could not be tolerated inside the most important church of Christianity. A censorship campaign was started, known as the \"Fig-leaf campaign\". Carafa and Monsignor Sernini (Mantua's ambassador) launched the campaign to remove the frescoes. When the Pope's own Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, said \"it was mostly disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully,\" and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather \"for the public baths and taverns,\" Michelangelo worked the Cesena's semblance into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld (far bottom-right corner of the painting). It is said that when Cesena complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain.\nThe genitalia in the fresco were later covered by the artist Daniele da Volterra, whom history remembers by the derogatory nickname \"Il Braghettone\" (\"the breeches-painter\").\nIn the painting, Michelangelo does a self portrait depicting himself as St. Bartholomew after he had been flayed (skinned alive) This is reflective of the feelings of contempt Michelangelo had for being commissioned to paint \"The Last Judgement\"."}

However, in 1857 rebellions broke out in many different places, Murree being one of these places. People thought the rule of the British was about to be overthrown. In the Murree hills it was the Dhund Abbasi and Karlal tribes who rose up against the British.\nBackground.\nAlthough the tribes of Murree had risen against the British, not everyone had been against British rule. Before British rule had been established in the area, the tribes had fought against the Sikhs. Under the command of Mohammed Ali Shah (also known as the Pir of Plasi), they had fought against the Sikh Army in Balakot - the troops here were commanded by Syed Shah Ismail Shahid and Syed Ahmad Shaheed (known as \"The Martyrs\")\nThe British, after battling in Rawalpindi in 1845 had captured Rani Jind Kaur, the widow of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (the former Ruler of Punjab) - this caused the collapse of Sikh rule and, when the British marched into the Murree area, the local tribes at first welcomed them. However, many of the tribes soon considered that they had exchanged one form of occupation for another and events elsewhere in India also encouraged an uprising.\nThe British had recruited many of the tribes in the area into their army, for example many members of the Satti tribe were recruited as Sepoys and the British commanders (like elsewhere across Colonial India) won this war largely by the use of Indian soldiers.\nWar reaches Murree.\nThe War against the British then reached Murree and the Southern Areas of Hazara Division, the part of which is now known as Circle Bakote in July 1857 when the Dhund Abbasi leader Sardar Sherbaz Khan planned to attack the British.\nAttack on Murree.\nBy the end of August many of the British troops who had been in Murree had left to join the campaign in Delhi. Rebels had taken Delhi from British control and the British had sent as many soldiers as they could. The decision to send troops to Delhi meant that the defence of Murree was weakened However the British were unable to take Delhi quickly, and as Delhi still held out against the British the Dhund tribesmen decided to take Murree. The Dhund attacked Murree by rising on every side at the same time and crowding up the nearer hill-sides threatening destruction of the station. Several of the table-servants supported the hill-men, and for some hours the danger to Murree became imminent.\nAccording to the 1857 Punjab Mutiny Report the attack failed because the British were told of the plan to attack them. One of Lady Lawrence's servants, named Hakim Khan, told the British of the attack to come. The loyalty of Hakim was described in the report as \"the means, under God, of saving Murree\" The British quickly organised defences, and quickly got volunteers. A cordon of sentries surrounded the station and the three weakest points were held in some force. When the Dhunds arrived in the middle of the night they found the whole station waiting for them.\nAfter a few hours of skirmishing the Dhunds retreated with the loss of two or three of their men who had come within musket range of the British. After that, the British quickly arrested, convicted and executed two Hindustani doctors for being involved in the plot. They had been educated in government institutions, were practising in Murree and employed by the government. The British suspected that the Dhunds were expecting support from their Hindustani allies, so as well as the doctors several domestic servants were seized and punished.\nAn urgent request was sent to troops in Hazara to reinforce Murree and Major Beecher sent every available man from Abbottabad to Murree - however the British troops in Murree had managed to secure the station and beat off the attack before the arrival of reinforcements.\nAftermath.\nThe revolt did not succeed, the rebels' leaders were arrested and punished. All of Sardar Sherbaz Khan's eight sons were blasted by cannon fire in Murree whilst Sardar Khan himself was hanged."}

They inhabit Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. Most pygmy marmosets lives in troops of two to nine individuals, with a dominant male, a breeding female, and up to four successive litters of offspring. The modal size of a standard stable troop would be 6 individuals.\nPygmy marmosets have tawny agouti fur (the tip of the hair is a different color to the base) with an indistinctly dark-ringed tail. They can range in size from 4.6 in to 6 in but could possibly be half that size when they are first born since they are the size of a human thumb.\nThey are expected to live as long as 15-20 years. \nHabitat.\nThey live in flooded forest near rivers, bamboo thickets and the edges of agricultural fields. They're mostly native in South Africa but can also be found around the western part of the amazon rainforest. Can also be found in Bolivia, Peru, Columbia, and Western Brazil. \nDiet.\nPygmy marmosets mainly feed on gum (tree exudates, sap), but they also eat fruit, nectar and insects. They gouge holes in the bark of trees, and revisit these holes daily to collect the sap. The marmosets hang on with specially adapted claws.\nReferences.\n2.

The total population of Patra, including all its suburbs, is over 200,000 people. Patra is a coastal city, so it has a big port. Patra's port connects Greece with east-facing Italian ports such as Bari, Brindisi and Ancona. \nHistory.\nPatra developed in the third century BC. During the Roman period, Patra became an important city. In Patra Christianity arrived quite early, approximately in the first century AD, by St Andrew, who was martyred there. During the Middle Ages Patra was not very significant. Patra developed again after the Greek liberation from the Turks, in 1830 following the Greek revolution of 1821.\nSights.\nThe most important site in Patra is the contemporary Bridge Rion-Antirion which links Peloponnese and Sterea Ellada. This bridge is located a short distance from Patra's center, in the district of Rio. Opposite Rio is Antirio and it ends at the bridge. Other significant sites in Patra are the church of Agios Andreas and the Apollon theater. The cathedral of Agios Andreas is the third biggest churches in Greece.

On the floor, he marked the axis, along which the pendulum was swinging. After some time, he noticed, that the pendulum no longer swung along the axis he had marked on the floor, but on an different axis. When he tried to explain this, he considered, what could have caused the axis to change. He considered gravity. Gravity could not have caused the axis to change, as it only acts vertically. There were no other forces acting on the pendulum. So: according to Newton's laws, the pendulum did not change the axis it was swinging in. So it was the floor (or the earth) that changed this axis, because it rotated. \nVincenzo Viviani (1662-1703) had made similar observations, but he didn't attribute them to the rotation of the earth. \nOn the 3rd of February 1851, he repeated the experiment, with a 12m pendulum at the Paris observatory. On 26th of March he presented the experiment to the public: At the Panth\u00e9on, he used a 67m long pendulum, with a weight of 28kg. At the bottom of the pendulum, there was a tip that left a trace in a sandbox. This was an easy way to show the earth's rotation to common people. The metal ball of this pendulum still exists: Until 1946, it was stored at the Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers, then it was returned to the Panth\u00e9on.\nCaspar Garthe repeated the experiment at Cologne Cathedral, Friedrich Magnus Schwerd did in Speyer Cathedral. Their results were deceptive, and not nearly as good as those obtained in Paris. In 1879, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes wrote his thesis on the subject, doing extra calculations on the exact magnitude of the effect. In his thesis, he also pointing out the problems the people had encountered in Cologne and Speyer.\nAn exact copy of the original has been operating in the Panth\u00e9on since 1995. It takes 31h 50min to do a full rotation (of 360 degrees). \nBecause a Foucault pendulum is an easy way to show the rotation of the earth, such devices can be found in many science museums around the world today.

While modern guineafowl species are endemic to Africa, the helmeted guineafowl has been introduced as a domesticated bird widely elsewhere.\nTaxonomy and systematics.\nThis is a list of guineafowl species, presented in taxonomic order.\nPhylogeny.\nLiving Galliformes based on the work by John Boyd:\nDescription.\nThe insect- and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds of this family resemble partridges, but with featherless heads, though both members of the genus \"Guttera\" have a distinctive black crest, and the vulturine guineafowl has a downy brown patch on the nape. Most species of guineafowl have a dark grey or blackish plumage with dense white spots, but both members of the genus \"Agelastes\" lack the spots. While several species are relatively well known, the plumed guineafowl and the two members of the genus \"Agelastes\" remain relatively poorly known. These large birds measure from 40\u201371\u00a0cm (16\u201328\u00a0in) in length, and weigh 700\u20131600\u00a0g or 1.5-3.5\u00a0lb. Guinea hens weigh more than guinea cocks, possibly because of the larger reproductive organs in the female compared to the male guinea fowl. Also, the presence of relatively larger egg clusters in the dual-purpose guinea hens may be a factor that contributes to the higher body weight of the guinea hens.\nBehavior and ecology.\nThe species for which information is known are normally monogamous, mating for life, or are serially monogamous; however, occasional exceptions have been recorded for helmeted and Kenya crested guineafowl, which have been reported to be polygamous in captivity. All guineafowl are social, and typically live in small groups or large flocks. Though they are monogamous, species of the least-derived genera \"Guttera\", \"Agelastes\", and \"Acryllium\" tend toward social polyandry, a trait shared with other primitive galliforms such as the crested partridge and Congo peafowl.\nGuineafowl travel behind herd animals and beneath monkey troups, where they forage within manure and on items that have fallen to the understory from the canopy. They play a pivotal role in the control of ticks, flies, locusts, scorpions, and other invertebrates. They pluck maggots from carcasses and manure.\nWild guineafowl are strong flyers. Their breast muscles are dark (aerobic metabolism), enabling them to sustain themselves in flight for considerable distances if hard-pressed. Grass and bush fires are a constant threat to them and flight is the most effective means of escape.\nSome species of guineafowl, like the vulturine guineafowl, may go without drinking water for extended periods, instead sourcing their moisture from their food. Young guineafowl (called keets) are very sensitive to weather, in particular cold temperatures.\nGuinea hens are not known to be good mothers, but in the wild, the guinea hen's mate (a guinea cock) may help tend the young keets during the day by keeping them warm and finding food. Sometimes, more than one cock helps raise the young. Guineafowl (hens and cocks together) make good parents. During warm weather, the cock is unlikely to set on the keets during the night (leaving that duty to the hen), but may help the hen keep them warm at night when temperatures drop below freezing.\nGuineafowl may be trained to go into a coop (instead of roosting in trees) when very young. Once hatched and ready to leave the brooder (around 3 weeks), they may be enclosed in a coop for at least three days so they learn where \"home\" is. When guinea parents (that already roost in a coop) raise their own keets, the hen sets on them outdoors at night, but then the parents teach the keets to also go into the coop in the evenings around 3 weeks of age.\nEach sex has a different call, which can be used to differentiate between female and male. Unlike chickens (which generally do best with one rooster for a flock of hens), guinea fowl do well with one cock for each hen.\nDistribution and habitat.\nGuineafowl species are found across sub-Saharan Africa, some almost in the entire range, others more localized, such as the plumed guineafowl in west-central Africa and the vulturine guineafowl in north-east Africa. They live in semiopen habitats such as savanna or semideserts, while some, such as the black guineafowl, mainly inhabit forests. Some perch high on treetops.\nThe helmeted guineafowl has been introduced in East Africa, the West Indies, the United States, Britain, and India, where it is raised as food or pets.\nGuineafowl as food.\nGuineafowl meat is drier and leaner than chicken meat and has a gamey flavour. It has marginally more protein than chicken or turkey, roughly half the fat of chicken and slightly fewer calories per gram. Their eggs are substantially richer than those of chickens."}

It was one of the first experiments showing that bacteria can get DNA through a process\nGriffith used two strains of \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\". He then uses the bacteria to infect the mice, which have many similar characteristics to humans. He used a type III-S (smooth) and type II-R (rough) strain. The III-S strain covers itself with a polysaccharide capsule that protects it from the host's immune system. This means that the host will die. The II-R strain does not have that protective shield around it and is killed by the host's immune system.\nIn this experiment, bacteria from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither harmed the mice on their own, the blend of the two was able to kill mice.\nGriffith was also able to get both live II-R and live III-S strains of \"S. pneumoniae\" from the blood of these dead mice. He concluded that the type II-R had been \"transformed\" into the lethal III-S strain by a \"transforming principle\" that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.\nToday, we know that the \"transforming principle\" Griffith saw was the DNA of the III-S strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the shielding polysaccharide part from attack. Armed with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host.\nThe exact nature of the transforming principle was confirmed in the experiments done by Avery, McLeod and McCarty, as well as Hershey and Chase."}

This is seen in microbiology where strains are got from a single cell colony, and are quarantined by being in a Petri dish. Strains are also commonly referred to in virology, in horticulture, and with rodents used in experimental studies.\nMicrobiology/Virology.\nA strain is a genetic variant or subtype of a microorganism, that is to say a virus or bacterium or fungus. For example, a \"flu strain\" is a certain biological form of the influenza or \"flu\" virus. Properly speaking, bacteria, archaea and viruses do not have species, because they do not have eukaryote-type sexual reproduction. Bacteria do exchange DNA, but they may exchange it between different kinds of bacteria, which shows their difference from eukaryotes. Strains are therefore an essential part of bacterial identification. \nPlants.\nIn botany, the term is not used to rank plants. It is sometimes used to refer to all the descendants produced from a common ancestor that share a uniform morphological or physiological character. A strain is a designated group of offspring that have descended from a modified plant, produced ether by conventional breeding or by biotechnological means or result from genetic mutation. \nFor example, some rice strains are made by inserting new genetic material into a rice plant, all the descendants of the genetically modified rice plant are a strain with a unique genetic code that is passed on to later generations. The strain designation, a number or a formal name, covers all the plants that descend from the originally modified plant. The rice plants in the strain can be breed to other rice strains or cultivars, and if desirable plants are produced, these are further breed to stabilize the desirable traits; the stabilized plants that can be propagated and come true, are given a cultivar name and released into production to be used by farmers.\nRodents.\nA mouse or a rat strain is a group of animals that is genetically uniform. Strains are used in laboratory experiments. Mouse strains can be inbred or genetically engineered, while rat strains are usually produced by inbreeding."}

At school he played both rugby football and cricket very well. By his final year in England, he was captain of the Rugby XI and he was listed in Bells Sporting Life as being one of the most promising young cricketers in England.\nIn 1859, Wills was involved with others in creating a set of football rules that were like a cross between rugby, soccer and Gaelic football. He made up the game for cricketers to keep in shape during the off-season (winter). Wills had help from people who included his cousin Henry Colden Harrison, and W.J. Hammersly and J.B. Thompson. This game is now Australian Rules Football. \nWills grew up with Indigenous Australians. He spoke the language of the people who lived near him and played with the children. It has been suggested that Australian Rules Football is based in part on \"Marn Grook\", an Aboriginal game with some similar rules to Australian Rules Football.

These impure atoms are called donor impurities because they give free electrons to a semiconductor. The doping increases the number of charge carriers in the material for conduction (read more: why do we need doping in semiconductor?). A n-type semiconductor is a lot more conductive than the pure silicon or germanium.\nIntroduction.\nSemiconductor materials like silicon and germanium have four electrons in their outer shell. The outer shell of electrons is called the valence shell. The four electrons are used by the semiconductor atom in forming bonds with its neighbouring atoms. This leaves a low number of electrons available for conduction. \nPentavalent elements are those elements which have five electrons in their outer shell. To make the n-type semiconductor, pentavalent impurities like phosphorus or arsenic are added. Four of the impurities' electrons form bonds with the surrounding silicon atoms. This leaves one electron free. The resulting material has a large number of free electrons. Since electrons are negative charge carriers, the resultant material is called an n-type (or negative type) semiconductor. The pentavalent impurity that is added is called a 'dopant' and the process of addition is called 'doping'.\nManufacture.\nN-type semiconductors are manufactured by doping pure semiconductor material. The amount of impurity added is very small compared to the amount of semiconductor. The way this new semiconductor works is changed by controlling the quantity of the dopant.\nExamples.\nArsenic doped Silicon, Phosphorus doped Silicon, Arsenic doped Germanium, Phosphorus doped Germanium etc. are the examples of n-type semiconductor."}

A plug-in hybrid differs primarily in that it can be plugged in to charge the batteries, while a conventional hybrid relies solely on energy generated from braking, coasting or from the gasoline engine.\nHowever, a plug-in hybrid uses larger battery packs that can be recharged by connecting to common household electricity. Plug-in hybrids can be driven for long distances\u2014from a few miles to as much as 40 miles\u2014without using any gasoline. Plug-in hybrid cars are also known as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or PHEVs. Plug-in hybrid cars that use a gas engine exclusively for recharging batteries\u2014rather than directly powering the wheels\u2014are also called Extended-Range Electric Vehicles or E-REVs.\nFueling a car with electricity is about 5 times cheaper than fueling it with gasoline. That is equivalent to buying gasoline at less than $1 per gallon. It also reduces greenhouse pollution and helps reduce crude oil imports. Also plug-in hybrids produced substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than either conventional gasoline cars or unplugged hybrids. The reduction in emissions results from electric operation being much more efficient than gasoline operation. \nCriticisms.\nCriticisms of the hybrid include the additional cost, weight, and size of a larger battery pack. But The extra weight of the batteries will be offset somewhat by the reduced weight of the gas engine. \nIt is obvious for most people that internal combustion engine cars cannot represent the future anymore because of the oil reserves that are estimated to be finished in forty or fifty years. Obviously, Plug-in vehicles cannot be considered a short term option because we lack the needed infrastructure and capable batteries for increasing the autonomy that is currently limited. The general opinion was that, at least for the next seven or eight years, Plug-ins are not going to become the standard in hybrid vehicles and that regular HEVs will have the biggest proportion on the market."}

It has the most members of any technical professional organization in the world, with more than 400,000 members in more than 160 countries. About 45% of IEEE's members live outside the United States.\nIt was formed in 1963 by the merger of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE, founded 1912) and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, founded 1884).\nThe IRE concerned mostly radio engineering. The major interests of the AIEE were wire communications and light and electric power systems. As technology developing, the IRE and the AIEE became difficult to distinguish. And people who belong to both group were increasing gradually. After World War II, the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE merged the organizations on January 1, 1963.\nIEEE says its purpose is \"scientific and educational, directed toward the advancement of the theory and practice of electrical, electronics, communications and computer engineering, as well as computer science, the allied branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences.\" In pursuing these goals, the IEEE serves a major publisher of scientific journals, provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology and so on.\nIEEE consists of 150 countries, 350,000 members, 39 societies, organized around specialized technical fields, with more than 300 local organizations that hold regular meetings. Famous presidents of IEEE and its founding organizations include Elihu Thomson, Alexander Graham Bell, Ernst Weber. In 2008 the president of IEEE was Lewis M. Terman.\nIEEE produces 30 percent of the world's literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields, publishing well over 100 peer-reviewed journals. The content in these journals and from several hundred annual conferences are available in the IEEE's online digital library.\nStandards and development process.\nIEEE is one of the leading standards-making organizations in the world. The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) makes and maintains standards for the IEEE. IEEE standards affect a wide range of industries including: power and energy, biomedical and healthcare, Information Technology (IT), telecommunications, transportation, nanotechnology, information assurance, and many more. In 2005, IEEE had close to 900 active standards, with 500 standards under development. One of the more notable IEEE standards is the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN group of standards which includes the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networking standard (Wi-Fi)."}

It is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current. It is named after Luigi Galvani. It is an analog electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection, through a limited arc, in response to electric current flowing through its coil. The term has been expanded to include uses of the same mechanism in recording, positioning, and servomechanism equipment.\nOperation.\nThe most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument, often called a meter. It is used to measure the direct current (flow of electric charge) through an electric circuit. The D'Arsonval/Weston form used today is constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.\nWhen a direct current (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against the permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves the pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform, so that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current. A useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without oscillation.\nTangent galvanometer.\nA tangent galvanometer is an early measuring instrument used for the measurement of electric current. It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the tangent of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet in 1837.\nA tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle."}

Nearly all recording tape is of this type, whether used for recording audio or video or computer data storage.\nMagnetic tape recording uses magnetic tape which moves on a recording head. Electrical signals are fed to the recording head, inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal.\nDevices that record and playback audio and video using magnetic tape are generally called tape recorders and videotape recorders respectively. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape can be called a tape drive, a tape unit, or a streamer. Autoloaders and tape libraries are frequently used to automate cartridge handling.\nHistory.\nMagnetic tape was first invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany. Pfleumer's invention used an iron oxide(Fe2O3) powder coating on a long strip of paper.\nMagnetic tape has been used for data storage for over 50 years. In this time, many advances in tape have been made. Modern magnetic tape is most commonly packaged in cartridges and cassettes. \nToday, many other technologies like CD or DVD are replacing magnetic tape. However, innovation in the technology continues and tape is still widely used.\nStrength and Weakness.\nWhen storing large amounts of data, tape can be cheaper than disk or other data storage options. Tape storage has always been used with large computer systems. Modern usage is a high capacity medium for backups and archives. As of 2019, the highest capacity tape cartridge can store 330 TB of data without using compression.\nMagnetic tape data storage uses the Sequential access method for reading data. Tape has a longer access time than disk for random accesses since the deck must wind the tape to move from one location to another."}

Electrodes are an electrical conductor (usually a metal) that is connected to something that is not a metal. Electric current is a flow of charges through a conductor. There are two theories; one theory is conventional current flow and the other is actual current flow. The anode delivers conventional (or customary) current (which travels in the opposite direction as electrons) and the cathode receives that current. This means that electrons come out of the anode and electrons go into the cathode. \nThis lets an electric current go into an electrical device such as a battery or other electrical cell. It can also end in a vacuum, like in a cathode ray tube. In this case, the electrons may go into open space.\nIn other words, a cathode is a positive electrode on a battery and a negative electrode on an electrolytic cell. Electric current is perceived as flowing in the opposite direction that the electrons are flowing. So electrons go into the + (positive) terminal of a battery, but electric current goes out. Electrons go into the + (positive) terminal of an electrolytic cell, but electric current goes out.\nAn electrode through which electrons flows out of the device is termed a cathode because it is negatively charged. A cathode is a negative electrode on a battery and a negative electrode on an electrolytic cell."}

The project was announced on December 13, 2007 and opened in beta to the public on July 23, 2008. When it was opened, there were a few hundred articles mostly about health and medicine.\nKnol pages are \"meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read\", according to Manber. The term \"knol\", which Google defines as a \"unit of knowledge\", refers to both the project and an article in the project. Several experts see Knol as Google's attempt to compete with Wikipedia, while others point out the differences between the projects.\nContent.\nAnyone can create and own new knols. There can also be several articles on the same topic, each written by a different author.\nBecause multiple articles can have the same title, readers find a topic by searching, rather than just by title. The authors can say who can edit their articles: the public, other authors, or only themselves. They may also choose to include ads from Google's AdSense to their knols. Knol has a policy that specifies topics that are unacceptable for the project. Relevant nudity is allowed (in most countries), but pornography, commercial or otherwise, is forbidden. Also forbidden is discriminatory or violent content. Content designed to promote businesses, products or services is allowed, but articles devoid of substantive content and created solely to generate ad revenue are not.\nIn its early stages of development as a resource, Knol was criticised very much. Commentators have called it a \"wasteland\" of articles copied from other sources, entries that were outdated or abandoned, as well as spam or self-promotion. Knol is frequently criticized for having incomplete and inaccurate articles. Google has said that \"Since knol authors receive attribution, knols are a great forum for expressing your opinions.\" In October 2008, Google unveiled using Knols as a forum for debate, and enabled French, Italian and German versions, in the face of stagnating traffic.\nProcess.\nAnyone who wants to contribute to Knol must first sign in, with a Google account. The users should give their real names. If permission is given, Google will check if the name is true. Google will do this by credit card or phone. Google \"[believes] that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content\". The company hopes that \"knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line\".\nReaders who are logged in with a google account can comment on entries, rate them or suggest changes. This works much like a blog. When the project was announced, Manber said that \"Google will not serve as an editor in any way, and will not bless any content. All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors.\"\nAll knols are licensed by default under the Creative Commons CC-BY-3.0 license. This license allows anyone to reuse the material as long as the original author is named, but authors may choose the CC-BY-NC-3.0 license (which prohibits commercial reuse) or traditional \"all rights reserved\" copyright protections instead.\nKnol has \"nofollow\" outgoing links, using an HTML directive. This prevents links in its articles from influencing search engine rankings.\nWhat people say about Knol.\nPeople have described Knol as a rival to other encyclopedia sites such as Wikipedia and Scholarpedia. Sometimes people pointed out that the format was very different, and therefore it might be an addition to these sites. It might allow to get around some of the Problems of Wikipedia. The non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which owns the name Wikipedia and the servers hosting the Wikipedia projects, welcomed the Google Knol initiative saying that \"The more good free content, the better for the world.\" Wikipedia articles are written collectively under a \"neutral point of view\" policy,\nThere has been debate whether Google search results can remain neutral because of possible conflict of interest. According to Danny Sullivan, the editor of \"Search Engine Land\", \"Google\u2019s goal of making Knol pages easy to find on search engines could conflict with its need to remain unbiased.\" Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, raised similar concerns: \"At the end of the day, there's a fundamental conflict between the business Google is in and its social goals. What you're seeing here, slowly, is Google embracing an advertising-driven model, in which money will have a greater impact on what people have ready access to.\""}

There is some criticism of Wikipedia.\nCritics of Wikipedia.\nWikipedia editors know that the site should not be used as a primary source for research. A librarian, whose name is Philip Bradley, said Wikipedia does not have authority. For a printed encyclopedia, the people writing it have to make sure the information is correct, or they could lose their job. Some people say calling Wikipedia an \"encyclopedia\" means that people trust it even when they should not trust it. Some librarians, academics, and writers of other encyclopedias do not like Wikipedia as a source of information. Many schools and universities do not accept Wikipedia as a source, except most of them do not want \"any\" encyclopedias used - they want primary sources instead.\nCriticism of the Wikipedia community.\nKat Walsh, a person in the Wikimedia Foundation (which runs Wikipedia), said Wikipedia was easier when it was made. Today, there are many rules and it is more difficult for new people to change articles. Many people who change Wikipedia have stopped, and the number of article changers have gone down since 2006. In 2006, Jimmy Wales said most of changes on Wikipedia are made by about 500 people who \"all know each other\". But most of the changes are made by people who sometimes change articles, or who do not have Wikipedia accounts at all.\nOn some articles, many people bother each other. Sometimes good arguments are ignored because they are not popular with the article changers.\nTo stop vandalism, some people have administration powers. People with administration powers can delete articles, stop a change on an article, and stop users. There are special rules to stop people with administrative powers from taking too much control, but the ideas of people with administration powers can be over the ideas of other people."}

It is served hot and made with lentils. It is popular all over the Middle East. Usually it is a vegetarian soup, but can also be made with meat stock. Red or green lentils may be used and in some recipes the lentils are boiled with vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, parsley and onion, and then pureed. Things commonly added include garlic, cumin, and lemon juice. Sometimes croutons are added to make it look good.\nLentil soup is mentioned in the Bible: In Genesis 25:34, Esau is prepared to give up his birthright for a pot of fragrant red lentil soup being cooked by his brother, Jacob. \nThe ancient Greek dramatist, Aristophanes, mentions lentil soup in his plays: He describes it as the \"sweetest of delicacies.\"\nLentil soup was once a food for the poor. Today, it is recognized as highly nutritious and provides a good source of protein, fiber, iron and potassium."}

The program was started at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, by the then college president Gordon Chalmers which was then called the \"Kenyon Plan\". The first study was conducted by three preparatory schools\u2014the Lawrenceville School, Phillips Academy, and Phillips Exeter Academy\u2014and three universities\u2014Harvard University, Princeton University, and Yale University. In 1952 they gave the report \"General Education in School and College: A Committee Report\" which said to allow high school seniors to study college level material and to take achievement examinations that allowed them to get college credit for this work. The second committee, the Committee on Admission with Advanced Standing, developed and put the plan to choose a curriculum. A pilot program was run in 1952 which covered eleven disciplines.\nThe College Board, a non-profit organization based in New York City, has run the AP program since 1955. From 1965 to 1989, Harlan Hanson was the director of the Advanced Placement Program. It makes and keeps guidelines for the teaching of higher level courses in various subject areas. In addition, it supports teachers of AP courses and universities. These activities are funded through fees charged to students taking AP Exams.\nIn 2006, over one million students took over two million Advanced Placement examinations. Many high schools in the United States offer AP courses, though the College Board allows any student to take any examination, regardless of participation in the course. Therefore, home-schooled students and students from schools that do not offer AP courses have an equal opportunity to take the examination.\nAs of the 2011 testing season, exams cost $87 each, though the cost may reduced for poor students who cannot pay for it. The exam reduction is $22 per exam from College Board plus an additional $8 rebate per fee-reduced exam from the school. There may be further discounts depending on the state. Out of the $87, $8 goes directly to the school to pay for the administration of the test, which some schools will reduce to lower the cost to the student.\nOn April 3, 2008, the College Board announced that four AP courses \u2013 French Literature, Latin Literature, Computer Science AB, and Italian Language and Culture \u2013 will be gone after the 2008\u20132009 school year due to no money.\nDifficulty.\nAdvanced Placement coursework is made to be very hard for average high school students. Most AP courses are sufficient preparation for the AP exams that students can take at the end of the year. If students do well on these exams, they can skip the introductory courses in college.\nThe academic benefit of AP coursework, aside from being able to pass out of college courses with good AP exam scores, is that students get an extra GPA point particularly for that class. An A+ or A in regular US History, for example, will factor in 4.0 GPA points to a student's grade; however, an A+ or A in AP US History would factor in 5.0 GPA points, which would improve that student's grade a lot.\nAP courses are not required to go to college however, most students who apply to picky colleges and universities like Stanford University and MIT take multiple AP courses in high school. They do this for various purposes:\nScoring.\nAP tests are scored on a 1 to 5 scale as follows:\nGrading the AP exam takes a long time. The multiple choice part is graded by a computer and the essays are scored by a group of teachers that do not teach at the student's school.\nStudents usually find out what they got on the test until the middle of July .\nSome students who do well on their AP exams may be allowed to skip a few classes in college. Generally, if a student gets a 4 or 5, then their university will award them credit; some colleges will also take a 3."}

Manichaeism appears to have died out before the sixteenth century in southern China.\nThe original six sacred books of Manichaeism were written in Syriac Aramaic. They were soon translated into other languages to help spread the religion. As they spread to the east, the Manichaean writings passed through Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian, and ultimately Uyghur and Chinese translations. As they spread to the west, they were translated into Greek, Coptic, and Latin. The spread and success of Manichaeism were seen as a threat to other religions, and it was widely persecuted in Christian, Zoroastrian, and later, Islamic areas."}

{"id": "142773", "revid": "19712", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142773", "title": "Niobe", "text": "In Greek mythology, Niobe (\u039d\u03b9\u03cc\u03b2\u03b7) was the daughter of the semi-legendary ruler Tantalus, called the \"Phrygian\" and sometimes even as \"King of Phrygia\" Tantalus ruled in Sipylus, a city located at the western end of Anatolia. The city has the same name than the mountain on which it was founded (Mount Sipylus) and of which few traces remain, and not in the traditional heartland of Phrygia lying more inland and centered around Gordion. Niobe was an Anatolian princess. She married Amphion of Thebes and Greek mythology was a vehicle for her historical record mixed with legends. Niobe was the sister of Pelops, who gave his name to the Peloponnese.\nLife.\nAccording to the Greek myth, Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because the goddess only had two children, the twins Apollo and Artemis, while Niobe had fourteen children (the Niobids), seven male and seven female. Her famously quoted speech which caused the indignation of the goddess is as follows:\nArtemis killed Niobe's daughters and Apollo killed Niobe's sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life. The bodies of her children lay for nine days unburied, for Zeus had changed the people to stone; on the tenth day they were buried by the gods. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions at least one Niobid was spared, (usually Meliboea). Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo for swearing revenge. A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylus (Spil Mount) of Lydia in Anatolia and was turned into a stone waterfall as she wept unceasingly. Spil Mount has a natural rock formation resembling a female face claimed to be Niobe, not to be confused with a sculpture carved into the rock-face of nearby crag Coddinus, north of Spil Mount, probably representing Cybele and attributed by the locals to Broteas, the ugly brother of Niobe. The rock formation is also known as the \"Weeping Stone\", as the stone is said to have wept tears during the summer. The rock appears to weep because it is porous limestone and rainwater seeps through the pores. \nThere are various accounts about how and where Niobe died; the story that returns Niobe from Thebes to her Lydian homeland is recorded in \"Bibliotheke\" 3.46.\nThe names and number of her children, and the time and place of their death, are variously given. This , described by Pausanias (i. 21) and Quintus Smyrnaeus (i. 293-306), both natives of the district, was the appearance assumed by a cliff on Sipylus when seen from a distance and from the proper point of view (see Jebb on Sophocles, \"Antigone,\" 831). It is to be distinguished from an archaic figure still visible, carved in the northern side of the mountain near Magnesia, to which tradition has given the name of Niobe, but which is really intended for Cybele.\nAccording to some, Niobe is the goddess of snow and winter, whose children, slain by Apollo and Artemis, symbolize the ice and snow melted by the sun in spring; according to others, she is an earth-goddess, whose progeny - vegetation and the fruits of the soil - is dried up and slain every summer by the shafts of the sun-god. Burmeister regards the legend as an incident in the struggle between the followers of Dionysus and Apollo in Thebes, in which the former were defeated and driven back to Lydia. Heffter builds up the story round the dripping rock in Lydia, really representing an Asiatic goddess, but taken by the Greeks for an ordinary woman. Enmann, who interprets the name as \"she who prevents increase\" (in contrast to Leto, who made women prolific), considers the main point of the myth to be Niobe's loss of her children. He compares her story with that of Lamia, who, after her children had been slain by Zeus, retired to a lonely cave and carried off and killed the children of others. The appearance of the rock on Sipylus gave rise to the story of Niobe having been turned to stone. The tragedians used her story to point the moral of the instability of human happiness; Niobe became the representative of human nature, liable to pride in prosperity and forgetfulness of the respect and submission due to the gods.\nThe tragic story of Niobe was a favourite subject in literature and art. Aeschylus and Sophocles wrote tragedies upon it; Ovid has described it at length in his \"Metamorphoses.\" In art, the most famous representation was a marble group of Niobe and her children, taken by Sosius to Rome and set up in the temple of Apollo Sosianus (Pliny, \"Nat. Hist.\" xxxvi. 4). What is probably a Roman imitation of this work was found in 1583 near the Lateran, and is now in the Uffizi gallery at Florence. In ancient times it was disputed whether the original was the work of Praxiteles or Scopas, and modern authorities are not agreed as to its identity with the group mentioned by Pliny.\nThe story of Niobe is an ancient one among Greeks: Niobe is mentioned by Achilles to Priam in Homer's \"Iliad\" book XXIV, as a stock type for mourning. Priam is like Niobe in that he is grieving for his son Hector, who was killed and not buried for several days. Niobe is also mentioned in Sophocles'\n\"Antigone\": as she is marched toward her death, Antigone compares her own loneliness to that of Niobe. The \"Niobe\" of Aeschylus, set in Thebes, survives in fragmentary quotes that were supplemented by a papyrus sheet containing twenty-one lines of text. From the fragments it appears that for the first part of the tragedy the grieving Niobe sits veiled and silent. Sophocles too contributed a \"Niobe\" that is lost. Furthermore, the conflict between Niobe and Leto is mentioned in one of Sappho's poetic fragments, (\"Before they were mothers, Leto and Niobe had been the most devoted of friends.\") The subject of Niobe and the destruction of the Niobids was part of the repertory of Attic vase-painters and inspired sculpture groups and wall frescoes as well as relief carvings on Roman sarcophagi.\nNiobe's iconic tears were also mentioned in Hamlet's soliloquy (Act 1, Scene 2), in which he contrasts his mother's grief over the dead King, Hamlet's father \u2014 \"like Niobe, all tears\" \u2014\nto her unseemly hasty marriage to Claudius."}

It officially began May 15, 1996 in the eastern north Pacific and on June 1, 1996 in the central north Pacific. It ended on November 30, 1996. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nFew notable storms formed this season, however it was very eventful. Twelve tropical cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category\u00a04 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Douglas.\nStorms.\nHurricane Alma.\nAlma was the first of three consecutive storms to come close to, or make landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten-day span. Alma killed at least three people, and possibly twenty. Three were killed when a house near Lazaro Cardenas collapsed. There were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in Puebla from rains related to Alma. Trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places. Roads were flooded and covered with Debris.\nHurricane Boris.\nHurricane Boris was the second consecutive storm to approach close to Mexico. It made landfall halfway between Acapulco and Lazaro Cardenas on June 29. It killed ten people. A flood caused by Boris on the San Jeronimo River left thousands homeless.\nTropical Storm Cristina.\nCristina was the third cyclone to come close to Mexico in the space of ten days. It killed a fisherman when his boat was caught at sea off Oaxaca. At least 11 other fishing boats and 22 people were missing. Their fate is unknown.\nHurricane Douglas.\nHurricane Douglas was a continuation of Atlantic Hurricane Cesar, which crossed Central America. Continuing Cesar's nearly due-west heading, it was still a tropical storm when it entered the Pacific on July 29, and quickly regained hurricane status.\nDouglas's strengthened over the next two days as it turned west-northwest, paralleling the coast of Mexico. It reached its peak intensity on August 1, with winds of and a central pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane of the season. Its slow weakening began on August 2 as it entered cooler waters, and it officially dissipated on August 6, though like many Pacific hurricanes, a remnant circulation could be tracked westward for several days afterward.\nHurricane Fausto.\nThe precursor disturbance to Fausto was first noticed over Venezuela as early as August 31, and may have been related to the tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Fran. By September 4 the wave had crossed Central America into the Pacific; it steadily organized until it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fausto on September 10.\nFausto intensified rapidly after it reached hurricane intensity on the 12th, peaking with sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of . The hurricane weakened as an approaching trough increased shear over the storm; this same trough also turned the storm north on the 13th, where it made landfall as a minimal hurricane Baja California that day. On September 14, the storm turned northeastward across the Gulf of California, and dissipated inland over the Sierra Madre range after its second landfall as a hurricane. Its extratropical remnants flared up briefly over northern Mexico and Texas, but otherwise soon lost their identity.\nDamage in Mexico was relatively minor, with only a single casualty caused by a downed power line.\nHurricane Hernan.\nHurricane Hernan made landfall in a thinly-populated region of Mexico. It washed out roads, and knocked down power lines and telephone poles. There were 100 injuries but no deaths."}

The most notable storm this year was Hurricane Kenna, which reached Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico, on October 25. It killed four people and was one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever strike the western coast of Mexico. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico, and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast, although it remained offshore. \nOther storms were individually unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category 5 intensity, but neither did any damage. Hurricane Fausto, while it had no effect on land, regenerated into a tiny tropical storm at a very high latitude.\nSeason summary.\nIt officially started May 15, 2002, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 2002, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2002. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nThere were twelve tropical storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean this season. Of those, six became hurricanes and five became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or high on the Saffir Simpson Scale. A record three Category 5 storms formed. In the central Pacific, one tropical storm, one hurricane, and one major hurricane formed. The season saw below average activity in terms of the number of systems, but above average activity in terms of stronger storms. This was due to a moderately strong El Ni\u00f1o that also suppressed activity in the Atlantic Ocean.\nAlso of note this season is an unusual gap in storm formation during the first three weeks of August. That time usually sees several nameable storms, but for some reason there were none.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Boris.\nOn June 8, an area of disturbed weather that had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two-E. It became a tropical storm the next day. After peaking on June 9, steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two ridges of high pressure. Shear increased, and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10. The next day, Boris degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12.\nBoris dumped heavy rains on sections of the Mexican coast. Several homes at an unspecified location were damaged. There were no deaths.\nTropical Storm Julio.\nAn area of convection and disturbed weather possibly related to outflow from Hurricane Isidore developed a circulation on September 23 and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 25. The depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm the same day. Julio turned to the northwest and peaked just before landfall near Lazaro Cardenas on September 26. The storm quickly dissipated over Mexico.\nNo one was killed by Julio. Around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash flooding.\nHurricane Kenna.\nA powerful Category 5 hurricane at its peak, the third of the season, Kenna made landfall on Mexico as a Category 4. As of 2005, it is the most recent Pacific hurricane to have its name retired.\nKenna killed four people in Mexico and left thousands homeless. Its total damage was from 5 to 100 million dollars.\nTropical Depression Eleven-E.\nEleven-E threatened land. It resulted in warnings and watches being issued for parts of the Baja California Peninsula, but it weakened to a remnant low before strengthening into a storm. No deaths or damages were reported. Eleven-E was the final storm of the season. It lasted for two days in November and dissipated on the sixteenth day of that month."}

Hurricanes Emilia, Gilma, John, and Olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars. Elsewhere, Hurricane Rosa killed several people in Mexico.\nActivity.\nThis season had slightly above average activity. Five hurricanes reached Category 2 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In addition, there were four other hurricanes and eight tropical storms. In the Central Pacific, two tropical storms and one hurricane formed.\nHurricane Emilia.\nHurricane Emilia was a powerful Category 5 storm. It briefly threatened the Hawaiian Islands near peak strength, but instead encountered wind shear and weakened. There was minor damage to roofs and some downed trees, and moderate rainfall.\nHurricane Gilma.\nHurricane Gilma was the strongest storm of the season, and the first Category 5 storm in the East Pacific since Ava in 1973. It is also the strongest July storm in the east Pacific, and is the fifth strongest overall.\nHurricane/Typhoon John.\nHurricane John was the longest lasting and most continuous tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history. Its life began on August 11 south of Mexico, and 31 days later the storm became extratropical south of Alaska, after reaching Category 5 strength and passing the International Date Line twice. John caused $15 million (1994 USD) in damage on Johnston Island.\nTropical Depression One-C.\nAn area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on August 9 while located 740 miles (1190\u00a0km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression moved westward without organizing, and dissipated on the 14th. Moisture from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of Hawaii, totaling to over 15 inches. The flooding closed all major roads in Hilo, and was considered the worst flooding in 40 years. The rainfall destroyed 2 homes and damaged 214, 14 severely. It also damaged roads and businesses. Damage throughout the island totaled to $5 million (1993 USD).Flooding occurred in Maui as well, where landslides blocked portions of the Hana Highway. \nHurricane Olivia.\nHurricane Olivia was the second strongest storm of the season. It is one of the ten most intense east Pacific hurricanes ever recorded. At the time, it was the strongest October storm.\nHurricane Rosa.\nAn area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on October 8. It had trouble organizing, and advisories were discontinued for a while. The cyclone finally became a tropical storm on October 11 and was named Rosa. It moved glacially, but eventually a trough steered Rosa north and then northeast. Rosa intensified quickly, peaking at Category 2 intensity just before landfall near La Concepcion on the morning of October 14. Rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of Mexico, and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the Plains and Mississippi Valley, moistening the atmosphere enough in Texas ahead of a slow moving occluded cyclone to help set the stage for a significant flood event in east Texas on the October 17.\nFour deaths, two in each of Nayarit and Durango, were reported. Four people were missing in Sinaloa. More than 100,000 people had their homes damaged in Nayarit. Telephone poles and power lines were downed in Sinaloa.

It slowly organized, and became Tropical Depression 10-E on August 11th, 300 nautical miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Conditions were not ideal for development, but it developed banding features and well-defined outflow, and managed to strengthen to become Tropical Storm John later that day.\nA strong ridge of high pressure over the Northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level shear kept John a tropical storm as its intensity fluctuated. The shear greatly lessened greatly on the 19th, and John became a hurricane on the 20th. Later that day, it became a major hurricane, and crossed into the Central Pacific shortly thereafter.\nHurricane John continued to strengthen, and reached a peak of 150 knots (175\u00a0mph winds) on the 23rd, passing 300 nautical miles south of Hawaii. John had posed a threat to the island days before, but the ridge of high pressure pushed John safely south of the island. The hurricane still caused heavy waves and rains, though. During these days, John's intensity was constantly checked by Air Force Reserve aircraft reconnaissance.\nJohn turned more northerly, where it steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane on the 26th. Then, it crossed just north of Johnston Island, where it caused moderate damage. Conditions again favored strengthening, and John re-strengthened to a 135\u00a0mph Category 4 hurricane, but upper level shear again weakened it. John crossed the International Date Line, and became Typhoon John.\nThe system continued to weaken, becoming a tropical storm on the 31st and a tropical depression on the 2nd while drifting eastward. John looped back to the northwest, and gradually restrengthened. An upper trough pulled the storm to the northeast on the 7th, and re-entered the Central Pacific on the 8th.

As a typhoon, Ioke managed to achieve Category 5-equivalent one-minute sustained winds one more time before weakening.\nIoke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon, but the storm passed over Johnston Atoll as a Category 2 hurricane and Wake Island as a Category 5 typhoon. Despite its strength, Ioke only caused moderate damage to Wake Island, and was not responsible for any fatalities.\nStorm history.\nThe system began in the third week of August as a persistent tropical disturbance south of the Hawaiian Islands. It was initially embedded in a trough, but gained convection and developed into a tropical depression about 775\u00a0miles south of Honolulu on August 19. It continued to strengthen, and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center designated the system with the name \"Ioke\" (IPA /i\u02d0\u02c8\u0259\u028a.ke\u026a/), which is Hawaiian for the name Joyce, becoming the first tropical storm to form in the Central Pacific since 2002.\nIoke quickly began to enter a process of rapid development; strengthening into a hurricane just 24 hours after it had formed. While safely avoiding the Hawaiian Islands, it continued to rapidly intensify and became a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater) on the morning of August 21. Later that day, Ioke intensified even further into a Category 4 hurricane. On August 22, it began to weaken as a result of cooler water and eyewall replacement cycle, and was downgraded back to a Category 2. As a Category 2 storm, Ioke affected Johnston Atoll.\nThe storm began to rapidly deepen again late on August 23 as it moved over increasingly warm water, reaching major hurricane status for the second time while moving to the west-northwest. From there, conditions would become even more favorable for development.\nOvernight between August 24 and August 25, Ioke strengthened rapidly, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the 25th - the first system originating from the Central Pacific to reach that intensity while still in the Western Hemisphere. Ioke then began to travel over a large environment highly favorable for hurricane development, and would maintain its strength for an extended period of time. Ioke also became the most intense hurricane ever to develop in the Central Pacific, with a central pressure of 921\u00a0mbar (27.19\u00a0inHg) at that point (which dropped to 920 mbar at its Central Pacific peak).\nIoke began to fluctuate in intensity afterward; weakened back to a Category 4 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, regaining Category 5 strength on August 26. Ioke held that intensity until crossing the International Date Line that evening (August 27 after the crossover), becoming Typhoon Ioke in the process. The storm weakened to Category 4 strength according to the JTWC, but by 2100 UTC on August 29, the JTWC advised that Ioke had regained Category 5 strength for the third time.\nAfter maintaining Category 5 strength for 12 hours, Ioke weakened back to a Category 4 for the final time on August 30 while approaching Wake Island. Ioke passed almost directly over the island on early September 1 and continued tracking to the west-northwest while slowly weakening over gradually cooling waters. On September 3, under the influence of an approaching trough, the typhoon began to recurve to the northwest, then to the north and away from Japan, while weakening more rapidly. Ioke began to transition into an extratropical storm late on September 4 due to increased wind shear and rapidly cooling seas, and the JTWC issued its last advisory at 1200 UTC on September 5 after it was decided that Ioke had begun extratropical transition. The JMA followed suit early on September 7 after Ioke had become completely extratropical east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.\nThe remnant extratropical low is currently monitored by National Weather Service and is expected to be near Alaska in 48 hours.\nImpact.\nDespite Ioke's extreme intensity and impacting two small land masses, damage was surprisingly moderate. Little damage was done on Johnston Atoll, and damage to infrastructure on Wake Island was less than expected, despite Ioke's eyewall brushing the island.\nJohnston Atoll.\nThe National Weather Service reported that the eastern eyewall of Ioke passed over the uninhabited Johnston Atoll, buffeting it with hurricane-force winds.\nTwelve people on a United States Air Force vessel in the Pacific were forced to abandon ship and take shelter in a hurricane-proof bunker on the island. They were reported safe the next day, and a reconnaissance flight reported little damage on the island.\nWake Island.\nDue to Typhoon Ioke's projected path near Wake Island, all 188 people who live and work there were evacuated in two C-17 Globemaster IIIs to Oahu in Hawaii. The typhoon's powerful winds, estimated to gust as high as 190\u00a0mph, damaged weather sensors on the island, causing them to fail after the instruments reported a 100\u00a0mph gust. A reconnaissance mission by the Coast Guard indicated the typhoon caused moderate damage on the island, including blown off roofs, damaged sides of buildings, and downed trees. However, the damage was repairable, and the major infrastructure on the island was intact.\nMinami Torishima.\nThe JMA issued evacuation orders for its staff on Minami Torishima on September 1 in view of the approaching typhoon, but so far, no damage has been reported."}

{"id": "142930", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142930", "title": "Closure (computer science)", "text": "In computer science, a closure is a function that has an environment of its own. In this environment, there is at least one bound variable (a name that has a \"value\", such as a number). The closure's environment keeps the bound variables in memory between uses of the closure.\nPeter J. Landin\u00a0gave this idea the name \"closure\"\u00a0in 1964. The Scheme programming language made closures popular after 1975. Many programming languages made after that time have closures.\nAnonymous functions (functions with no name) are sometimes wrongly called closures. Most languages that have anonymous functions also have closures. An anonymous function is also a closure if it has an environment of its own with at least one bound variable. An anonymous function with no environment of its own is not a closure. A named closure is not anonymous.\nClosures and first-class functions.\n\"Values\" may be numbers or some other type of data, such as letters, or data structures made up of simpler parts. In the rules of a programming language, the first-class values are values that can be given to functions, returned by functions, and bound to a variable name. Functions that take or return other functions are called higher-order functions. Most languages that have functions as first-class values also have higher-order functions and closures.\nFor example, take a look at the following Scheme function:\nIn this example, the lambda expression codice_1 is part of the function codice_2. When the function is run, Scheme must make the value of the lambda. It does this by making a closure with the code for the lambda and a reference to the codice_3 variable, which is a free variable inside the lambda. (A \"free variable\" is a name that is not bound to a value.)\nThe codice_4 function then runs the closure on each book in the list to pick which books to return. Because the closure itself has a reference to codice_3, the closure can use that value each time codice_4 runs the closure. The function codice_4 itself might be written in a completely separate file.\nHere is the same example rewritten in (JavaScript), another popular language with support for closures:\nECMAScript uses the word codice_8 here instead of codice_9, and the codice_10 method in place of the codice_4 function, but otherwise the code does the same thing in the same way.\nA function may create a closure and return it. The following example is a function that returns a function.\nIn Scheme:\nIn ECMAScript:\nThe closure environment keeps the bound variables codice_12 and codice_13 after the \"enclosing\" function (codice_14) returns. In languages without closures, these values would be lost after the enclosing function returns. In languages with closures, a bound variable must be kept in memory as long as any closure has it.\nA closure need not be formed using an anonymous function. The Python programming language, for example, has limited support for anonymous functions but does have closures. For example, one way the above ECMAScript example could be implemented in Python is:\nIn this example, the function named \"gradient\" makes a closure together with the variables \"f\" and \"dx\". The outer enclosing function named \"derivative\" returns this closure. In this case, an anonymous function would work also.\ndef derivative(f, dx):\n return lambda x: (f(x + dx) - f(x)) / dx\nPython must often use named functions instead because its lambda expressions may only contain other \"expressions\" (code that returns a value) and not \"statements\" (code that has effects but no value). But in other languages, such as Scheme, all code returns a value; in Scheme, everything is an expression.\nUses of closures.\nClosures have many uses:\nIn Scheme\nNote: Some speakers call any data structure that binds a lexical environment a closure, but the term usually refers specifically to functions."}

It continued to be popular during the 17th century and is still popular today.\nThe title is difficult to translate. A close translation is \u201ccomedy of craft\u201d. This is shortened from \"commedia dell\u2019arte all\u2019improvviso\", or \u201ccomedy of improvisation\u201d.\nThe plays of Commedia dell'arte were often performed by a small group of actors who traveled around and performed in town squares. The actors would pass a hat around for people to put money in.\nThe earliest known company was in Padua in 1545. By the turn of the seventeenth century there were several troupes (group of actors) such as the Gelosi, Confidenti, and Fedeli. Some troupes were popular at foreign courts, especially in France, where images from the commedia became a favorite theme of well-known artists.\nThe actors often wore masks. The stories were often about people being cunning. Hunger, love and money were important in the stories. There were several characters who often appeared in lots of the stories. These are called \"stock characters\". Examples of stock characters from Commedia dell'arte are: Harlequin, Pantalone, Arlecchino, Colombina, Pulcinella, Pierrot, Scaramuccia.\nCommedia dell'arte had a lot of influence on theatre plays in many countries. Punch and Judy shows, popular with children in Britain and other countries, are similar to Commedia dell'arte. They also have stock characters: Punch, Judy, the crocodile, the policeman etc."}

It accelerates charged particles by whirling them in a circle. The first cyclotrons were the size of a hand. Some modern circular accelerators use a circle as wide as a city.\nCyclotrons use perpendicular magnetic field to bend electrons and particles through into a semicircular path by an applied electric field. The applied electric field accelerates electrons between the \"D\" electrodes(also called \"dees\") of the magnetic field region.\nThe accelerating electric field reverses just at the time the electrons finish their half circle, so that it accelerates them across the gap. With a higher speed, they move in a larger semicircle. After repeating this process several times, they come out the exit port at a high speed.\nCyclotron Frequency.\nA moving charge in a cyclotron will move in a circular path under the influence of a constant magnetic field. If the time to complete one orbit is calculated:\nformula_1.\nIt is found that the period is independent of the radius. Therefore if a square wave is applied at angular frequency qB/m, the charge will spiral outward, increasing in speed.\nWhen a square wave of angular frequency \u03c9=qB/m is applied between the two sides of the magnetic poles, the charge will be boosted again at just the right time to accelerate it across the gap. Thus the constant cyclotron frequency can continue to accelerate the charge (so long as it is not relativistic)."}

She also made her first solo album, \"Airs and Graces\" in 1976. She recorded again with Prior, this time using the name Silly Sisters for their act together. In 1977 guitar player Martin Simpson worked with her in the recording studio for three albums. He moved to America in 1987. (Simpson has come back from America to be a guest player on her albums in the 2000s.) After he left, she worked with piano player Huw Warren.\nTabor stopped singing after many years as a performer. She worked as a librarian\n. With her husband David Taylor she ran a restaurant called \"Passepartout\" in Penrith, Cumbria, England. She returned to performing in the 1990s.\nSolo work.\nIn 1990, June Tabor made an album with the folk-rock band The Oyster Band called \"Freedom and Rain\". She went on tour with the Oyster Band. A live recording from the tour was made into an album by the Rykodisc label in 1991. In 1992 singer Elvis Costello wrote \"All this Useless Beauty\" just for Tabor. She recorded the song on \"Angel Tiger\". Costello didn't record it himself until 1996, on his album \"All This Useless Beauty\".\nIn 1983 June Tabor sang the title song for the BBC TV series \"Spyship\". In 1997 she was on Ken Russell's TV show, \"In Search of English Folk Song\" shown on Channel 4. Tim Winton, author of the 2001 novel \"Dirt Music\", made a selection of music to go with his novel. The CD \"Dirt Music\" (2001) includes \"He Fades Away\" by June Tabor, a sad song about the death of a miner. The song was on her 1994 CD \"Against the Streams.\" In 2002, at the \"Passchendale Peace Concert\" in Flanders, Tabor shared the stage with Coope Boyes and Simpson. On 30th June 2006 BBC Radio 3 broadcast \"Night Waves\" to remember the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. It was broadcast live, with World War I songs sung by June Tabor.\nOver the years she has worked in various styles including jazz and art song. She usually has a very plain and simple sound with a sad feeling to it. Her 2003 album \"An Echo of Hooves\" went back to the traditional ballad style. Many people said it was a great album. \"Allmusic\" said it was \"A stunning jewel in a remarkable career, and one of the best things Tabor\u2019s ever released.\" \"Always\" (2005) is a boxed set of four CDs, with songs from her whole career. It has many rare recordings.\nWork with other people.\nOn 24th October 2003 Tabor appeared on \"Later With Jools Holland\" (BBC TV), singing \"Hughie Graeme\". This was later put on a DVD of the series. \"Folk Britannia\" was the name of a concert at the Barbican centre, and a TV mini-series (February 2006, repeated in October). She sang \"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\" at the Barbican, under the heading \"Daughters of Albion\". Tabor sang one song on Ashley Hutchings' album \"Street Cries\" (2001). She also sang on a collection of folk musicians singing songs by the Beatles - \"Rubber Folk\" (2006). She sang Lennon's \"In My Life\" a cappella (with out any instruments).\nThe way June treats songs is different. For example she often sings traditional songs with just a piano. On the album \"Singing The Storm\" (2000) she sings with Savourna Stevenson's harp, and Danny Thompson's bass. In May 2004 she performed as part of \"The Big Session\" and sang Love Will Tear Us Apart as a duet with John Jones of The Oyster Band. In 1992, The Wire voted her song \"Queen Among the Heather\" one of the \"Top 50 Rhythms of all Time\".\nShe also has a sense of humour and fun. This can be seen in her work with Les Barker's The Mrs Ackroyd Band which performs his funny songs. Tabor has sung on three of their albums. In 1990 on the album \"Oranges and Lemmings\" she sang \"The Trains of Waterloo\", a funny version of the folk song \"The Plains of Waterloo\" in a duet with Martin Carthy. In 1994 on \"Gnus and Roses\" she sang \"The January June\", which made fun of her sad and serious singing style. In 2003 on the album \"Yelp!\" she sang \"There's a hole in my bodhran\", to the tune of \"There's a Hole in my Bucket\". She sang two songs on \"Beat The Retreat\", a tribute to Richard Thompson.\nRecordings.\nDuo with Maddy Prior\nSolo albums\nRecordings with The Oyster Band\nRecordings with The Mrs Ackroyd Band\nCollections"}

The county was named for Isaac Shelby. He was a hero of the King's Mountain Battle during the American Revolutionary War. Alabama gained statehood on 14 December 1819.\nMany of the first settlers came from South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Many came to this region after the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814. The 1820 census records say that Shelby County contained 2,492 people at that time, 2,044 whites and 448 Africans.\nU.S. Highway 31 was a two-lane highway at that time. Because it was the main artery from Birmingham to Montgomery, the highway played an important part in the growth of the community.\nGeorge L. Scott, Sr. was an Alabaster pioneer. He owned and operated Alabaster Lime Co. His shipping point, which was named after him, was known as \u201cScott Rock\u201d. Later, houses were built for his employees to live in. These houses became a community. It got its name from alabaster, a white chalky mineral. The First Bank of Alabaster opened in 1952. Its president was George L. Scott, Jr. He later became the first mayor of Alabaster. The first attempt in 1952 to incorporate Alabaster failed. In January 1953 the petition was filed again. On 23 February 1953, Alabaster was officially incorporated. There were 427 people living there. Other Alabaster pioneers were Kenton B. Nickerson and William J. Maxwell. In 1955, the Alabaster Water and Gas Board was formed. Alabaster merged with the adjoining city of Siluria, Alabama April 27, 1971.\nToday, Shelby County is the fastest-growing county in Alabama."}

He was one of the first performers in the renewed interest in British folk music in the 1960s. He has inspired other musicians such as Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Richard Thompson. He is seen as one of the most important people in English folk music.\nEarly life.\nMartin Carthy was born in Hatfield on May 21, 1941. He grew up in Hampstead, North London. After he left school he had a number of jobs. He worked behind the scenes at the open air theatre at Regent's Park as a prompter (helping actors who forgot their words). He later worked as an assistant stage manager (ASM) on a tour of \"The Merry Widow\". He then worked at Theatre in the Round in Scarborough. He then sang in coffee bars. He became a resident (regular act) at The Troubadour Folk Club in Earls Court in the early 1960s. He joined Redd Sullivan's \"Thameside Four\" in 1961. He is a famous solo performer of traditional songs. He has a very special individual style of guitar playing on his old Martin Guitar. He uses different ways of tuning his guitar. He has a strongly percussive (drum like) picking style that brings out the melody. His first album, \"Martin Carthy\", was released in 1965. It had Dave Swarbrick playing fiddle playing on some songs, although he was not named on the album cover. Carthy's way of playing the traditional song Scarborough Fair was used by Paul Simon on the Simon and Garfunkel album Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme in 1966. Simon did not admit that he had used Carthy's version.\nWorking with others.\nCarthy has also worked with many other musicians. He has sung with The Watersons since 1972.

It lived in enormous migratory flocks \u2014 sometimes containing more than two billion birds \u2014 that could stretch one mile (1.6\u00a0km) wide and 300 miles (500\u00a0km) long across the sky, sometimes taking several hours to pass.\nSome estimate that there were three billion to five billion passenger pigeons in the United States when Europeans arrived in North America. Others argue that the species had not been common in the Pre-Columbian period, but their numbers grew when devastation of the American Indian population by European diseases led to reduced competition for food.\nThe species went from being one of the most usual birds in the world during the 19th century to extinction early in the 20th century. At the time, passenger pigeons had one of the largest groups or flocks of any animal, second only to the Rocky Mountain locust.\nSome reduction in numbers happened because of habitat loss when the Europeans started settling further inland. The primary factor emerged when pigeon meat was commercialized as a cheap food for slaves and the poor in the 19th century, resulting in hunting on a massive scale. There was a slow decline in their numbers between about 1800 and 1870, followed by a catastrophic decline between 1870 and 1890. Martha, thought to be the world's last passenger pigeon, died on September 1, 1914, in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nIn the 18th century, the passenger pigeon in Europe was known to the French as tourtre; but, in New France, the North American bird was called tourte. In modern French, the bird is known as the pigeon migrateur.\nIn Algonquian languages, it was called \"amimi\" by the Lenape and omiimii by the Ojibwe. The term passenger pigeon in English derives from the French word \"passager\", meaning to pass by."}

{"id": "143225", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143225", "title": "Sergei Eisenstein", "text": "Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein (; January 23, 1898\u00a0\u2013 February 11, 1948) was a Soviet Russian movie director and movie theorist. He was known mostly for his silent movies \"Strike\", \"The Battleship Potemkin\" and \"\". He was also known for his historical epics \"Alexander Nevsky\" and \"Ivan the Terrible\". His work had a major impact on early movie directors because of his creative use of and writings about montage.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nEisenstein was born in Riga, Latvia but his family moved a lot in his early years. Eisenstein continued to move often during his life. Eisenstein's father Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein was of German-Jewish and Swedish descent and his mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, was from a Russian Orthodox family. He was born into a middle-class family. His father was an architect and his mother was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. Julia left Riga the year of the 1905 Revolution. She brought Sergei with her to St. Petersburg. Sergei would return at times to see his father. His father would later move to join them around 1910. His mother soon divorced his father and moved to France away from the family.\nAt the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering, Sergei studied architecture and engineering, the job of his father. At school with his fellow students however, Sergei would join the military to serve the revolution. His father did not support his joining the army. In 1918 Sergei joined the Red Army with his father, Mikhail, supporting the opposite side. This brought his father to Germany after defeat, and Sergei to Petrograd, Vologda, and Dvinsk. In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in Minsk, after success providing propaganda for the October Revolution. At this time, Sergei studied Japanese. He learned some three hundred kanji characters which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development. This also allowed him to see Kabuki theatre. Because of his studies, he traveled to Japan.\nFrom theatre to cinema.\nIn 1920 Eisenstein moved to Moscow, and began his career in theatre working for Proletkult. His productions there were named \"Gas Masks,\" \"Listen Moscow,\" and \"Wiseman\". Eisenstein would then work as a designer for Vsevolod Meyerhold. In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist, by writing \"The Montage of Attractions\" for LEF. Eisenstein's first movie, \"Glumov's Diary\", was also made in that same year. Dziga Vertov hired at first as an \"instructor\" for the film The movie formed part of his theatre production \"Wiseman\".\n\"Strike\" (1925) was Eisenstein's first full-length movie. \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) was well liked by critics throughout the world. Because he was known throughout the world, Eisenstein was able to direct \"\" (also known as \"Ten Days That Shook The World\"). The movie was part of the tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917. He then directed \"The General Line\" (also known as \"Old and New\"). People in the outside world praised the movies. However, in the Soviet Union, Eisenstein's focus on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements and montage, was not liked by the much of the Soviet movie community.\nTravels to Europe.\nIn the autumn of 1928, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe. He was joined by Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. The trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and others to learn about sound motion pictures. It would also show the famous Soviet artists to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zurich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Edouard Tiss\u00e9 entitled \"Frauennot - Frauengl\u00fcck\".\nAmerican projects.\nIn late April 1930, Jesse L. Lasky, working for Paramount Pictures, offered Eisenstein the chance to make a movie in the United States. He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930. However, this agreement failed. Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking did not work with the style and way movies were made in American movie studios.\nEisenstein proposed a biography of munitions invester Sir Basil Zaharoff and a movie version of \"Arms and the Man\" by George Bernard Shaw. He also made plans for a movie of \"Sutter's Gold\" by Jack London. But the studio's producers did not like the plan. Paramount then proposed a movie version of Theodore Dreiser's \"An American Tragedy\". This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930. Paramount disliked it completely. They also found themselves intimidated by Major Frank Pease, president of the \"Hollywood Technical Director's Institute\". Pease, an anti-communist, started a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract canceled. Eisenstein and his movie partners were given return tickets to Moscow, at Paramount's expense.\nEisenstein was faced with returning home as a failure. The Soviet movie industry was solving the sound-movie issue without him and his movies. His methods and ideas were becoming increasingly attacked as 'ideological failures'. They were called examples of formalism. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as \"Eisenstein on Disney\", have been found decades later as important scholarly texts. These are used in movie schools around the world.\nEisenstein spent a large amount of time with Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin recommended that Eisenstein meet American socialist author Upton Sinclair who Chaplin thought might help Eisenstein. Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the Soviet Union, and were known to Eisenstein. The two liked each other's work. Between the end of October 1930, and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had gotten an extension of Eisenstein's leave from the Soviet Union. He also received permission for Eisenstein to travel to Mexico to make a movie to be produced by Sinclair and his wife, Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair. They joined with three other investors to make the Mexican Film Trust.\nTrip to Mexico.\nOn November 24, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust. The deal was \"upon the basis of Eisenstein's desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity.\" The contract also said that the movie would be \"non-political.\" The money first came from Mrs. Sinclair and would be \"not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars.\" The schedule for making the movie would be \"a period of from three to four months,\". The contract also said that \"Eisenstein...agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair...\" An addition to the contract, dated December 1, allowed that the \"Soviet Government may have the [finished] movie free for showing inside the U.S.S.R.\" Reportedly, it was verbally decided that the movie was expected to be an hour long.\nBy December 4, 1930, Eisenstein was on his way to Mexico by train. He was joined by Alexandrov and Tisse. Later he came up with a short summary of the six-part movie which would come. This would be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project. The title for the project, \"\u00a1Que viva M\u00e9xico!\", was decided on some time later. While in Mexico, Eisenstein mixed socially with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Eisenstein liked these artists and Mexican culture in general. They inspired Eisenstein to call his movies, \"moving frescoes.\"\nAfter a long time away from the Soviet Union, Stalin sent a telegram saying he was worried that Eisenstein had become a deserter. Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, for the film's problems. Kimbrough had been sent along to act as a line producer on the movie. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to stop Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the movie in his own way.\nThe upset Sinclair shut down production. He ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining movie footage. The three Soviets came as well to see what they could do with the movie already shot. For the unfinished filming of the \"novel\" of Soldadera, Eisenstein had gotten 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army. This was lost due to Sinclair's canceling of production.\nWhen Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of Jesus along with other material of a pornographic nature. Eisenstein's re-entry visa had expired, and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Alexandrov and Tisse were, after a month's stay at the U.S.-Mexico border outside Laredo, Texas, allowed a 30-day \"pass\" to get from Texas to New York. From there, they would be allowed to leave for Moscow. Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining movie.\nEisenstein toured the American South, on his way to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to get the services of Sol Lesser. Lesser had just opened his own distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corp.. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative\u00a0\u2014 at the Sinclairs' expense\u00a0\u2014 and distribute any finished product. Two short movies and a short subject\u00a0\u2014 \"Thunder Over Mexico\" based on the \"Maguey\" footage, \"Eisenstein in Mexico\", and \"Death Day\" respectively\u00a0\u2014 were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934.\nEisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser movies, nor a later effort by his first biographer, Marie Seton, called \"Time In The Sun.\" He would publicly say that he had lost all interest in the project.\nReturn to Soviet Union.\nEisenstein's trip to the west made the Soviet movie business look at him with a suspicion that would never completely go away. He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933. This was possibly a result of depression because he realized that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage which was turned over by Sinclair to Hollywood editors.\nHe was then given a teaching job with the movie school GIK (now Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography) where he had taught before. In 1933 and 1934 he was in charge of writing the education plan. Eisenstein married filmmaker and writer Pera Atasheva (1900\u201365) in 1934. They remained married until his death in 1948. There is some question about his sexuality.\nIn 1935, he began another project, \"Bezhin Meadow\". It appears the movie had many of the same problems as \"Que Viva Mexico\". Eisenstein decided to movie two versions of the plot. One was for adult viewers and one was for children. He failed to set a clear shooting schedule. He also used a lot of film which meant a lot of costs and missed deadlines. The movie ran into problems because it was not fully supported by its American financers.\nThe thing that may have saved Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up saying that the \"Bezhin Meadow\" problems, along with several other problems facing the business, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been watching him. In the end, this made Boris Shumyatsky, \"executive producer\" of Soviet movies since 1932 to blame. In early 1938, he was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot. (The production executive at movie studio Mosfilm, where Meadow was being made, was also replaced, but without more executions).\nReturn to success.\nEisenstein was then able to impress Stalin again for \"one more chance\", and he chose, from two offerings, the job of a movie of \"Alexander Nevsky,\" with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev. This time, however, he was also given a co-writer, Pyotr Pavlenko, to bring in a completed script. He had professional actors to play the roles. He also had an assistant director, Dmitri Vasilyev, to make the filming faster.\nThe result was a movie critically received by both the Soviets and in the West. He won the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It was an obvious allegory and hard warning against the growing forces of Nazi Germany. This was started, completed, and put in theatres all within 1938. It was Eisenstein's first movie in nearly a decade. It also his first movie with sound.\nBut, within months of its release, Stalin entered into his agreement with Hitler. \"Nevsky\" was quickly pulled from distribution. Eisenstein returned to teaching. He was assigned to direct Richard Wagner's \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" at the Bolshoi Theatre. Eisenstein had to wait until Hitler's sent German troops across the Soviet border in a fatal first strike, to see \"Nevsky\" receive wide distribution and real international success.\nWith the war coming to Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma-Ata. There is where he first considered the idea of making a movie about Czar Ivan IV. Eisenstein wrote letters to Prokofiev from Alma-Ata. Prokofiev joined him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed the score for Eisenstein's movie. Eisenstein designed sets for an opera version of \"War and Peace\" that Prokofiev was creating.\nIvan trilogy.\nEisenstein's movie, \"Ivan The Terrible, Part I\", showing Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero, was liked by Joseph Stalin (and it won a Stalin Prize). The sequel, \"Ivan The Terrible, Part II\", was not approved of by the government. All the film from the not-finished \"\" was taken away, and most of it was destroyed (though several filmed scenes still exist today).\nEisenstein's health was also failing. He had a heart attack during the making of this movie. He died soon after of another heart attack at the age of 50. He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\nmovie theorist.\nEisenstein was one of the first to use montage, a specific form of movie editing. He and Lev Kuleshov, two of the first movie theorists, said that montage was the basis of movies. His articles and books\u00a0\u2014 especially \"Film Form\" and \"The Film Sense\"\u00a0\u2014 explain the need for montage in detail.\nHis writings and movies have continued to have a major impact on later filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just explaining a scene or moment through a \"linkage\" of related images. Eisenstein felt the \"collision\" of shots could be used to control the feelings of the audience and create movie metaphors. He believed that an idea should be concluded from comparing two different shots. This is what made a collage or montage within movie. He developed what he called \"methods of montage\":\nEisenstein taught movie making during his career at GIK. He also wrote the lessons for the directors' course there. His classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhni\u012d's \"Lessons with Eisenstein.\" Exercises and examples for students were based on literature such as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot.\" Another situation students had to produce was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's \"The Black Consul,\". Eisenstein also taught the specifics of directing, photography, and editing. He encouraged his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity. Eisenstein's teaching, like his movies, were politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin.\nIn his first movies, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives did not focus on individual characters. Instead, they addressed broad social issues, especially class conflict. He used basic characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the matching classes. He avoided using stars. Eisenstein's vision of communism brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling system of Joseph Stalin. Like many Bolshevik artists, Eisenstein pictured a new society which would pay for artists totally. This would free them from bosses and budgets. It would leave them free to create. But budgets and producers were as important to the Soviet movie business as the rest of the world. The isolated, post-revolution, new nation did not have the resources to nationalize its movie business at first. When it did, limited resources\u00a0\u2014 both monetary and equipment\u00a0\u2014 required production controls as big as in the capitalist world."}

It is in the Yass Valley Shire. The name probably comes from an Aboriginal word, \"Yarrh\" (or \"Yharr\"), which means 'running water'.\nYass is about 280 km southwest of Sydney and is 56\u00a0km north of Canberra. It is on the Hume Highway which is the main road between Melbourne and Sydney. The new Hume Freeway goes around the town. The Yass River flows past the town. It later flows into the Murrumbidgee River.\nYass has an impressive and historic main street. It includes many 19th century hotels with large verandahs. It is popular with tourists, some from Canberra and others taking a break from the Hume Highway.\nThe Pride of Erin Festival and Yass Show are held in March. The Yass Arts-and-Crafts Festival is held in November.\nHistory.\nThe Yass area has long been inhabited by Aboriginal tribes called the Wiradjuri and Ngunnawal. They called it \"yarrh\", meaning \u201crunning water.\u201d\nIn 1821 the area was visited by the European explorer Hamilton Hume. In 1830 a small village began. It started where the road crossed the Yass River. The road became the main road to Melbourne.\nYass became a District Council in 1842. By 1848 there were 248 people living in Yass. On 13 March, 1873, the Municipal District of Yass was begun. James Cottrell was elected as the first Mayor of Yass.\nOne of Australia's best known poets, A.B. 'Banjo' Paterson came to the area with his family in 1871. He was only 7 and spent his childhood in the district, near Binalong. He later bought a property at Wee Jasper, near Yass, so that his children could enjoy a country life. Poet and priest Patrick Hartigan was born near Yass in 1878. He studied at the local convent school as a youth. He wrote using the name John O'Brien.\nSir Walter Merriman started a farm called 'Merryville'. It became one of Australia's most famous sheep farms. It produced some of the best fine wool in 1903. Yass is an important area for raising sheep which have very fine wool. This is because of the soil and climate in the Yass area.\nYass was one of the sites suggested for the Australian Federal Capital after 1901.\nRailways at Yass.\nBecause of the steep hills the New South Wales Government Railways built the railway a few kilometres from the town. The people in Yass wanted the railway to pass closer or even through the town. In 1892, a light railway or tram was built to connect Yass Junction on the main railway line and Yass Town.\nYass Junction was the nearest railway station on the Sydney Melbourne railway to serve the national capital at Canberra. The uniform gauge (distance between the rails) railway line between Melbourne and Sydney was opened in 1961. The special train had to stop at Yass Junction to pick up William Charles Wentworth. He was a member of parliament who had worked hard to get the railway built. He could not get on the train at Sydney because he was needed in the parliament at Canberra.\nSt Augustines.\nSt Augustine's Parish Yass began in 1838 with the laying of the foundation stone of the church now called the Chapel.\nAn unusual modern style new building (the 'big' church) was begun in 1954. The bishop in charge was Bishop Young who later became the Archbishop of Hobart. The design for the church was by the architects Fowell Mansfield and Maclurcan of Sydney. The builder was James Wallace of 123 Sussex St Sydney.\nThere are important works of art by famous Australian sculptor Tom Bass in the Church:\nThe foundation stone of the new church was laid on 11 April 1954 by Archbishop Eris O'Brien and the church was opened on 29 April 1956, by Archbishop Guilford Young. Fifty year celebrations were organised on 29 April 2006 by Father Laurie Bent."}

The attack started when two heavily-armed terrorists opened fire and throw grenades on the public and police inside the CST (VT) Railway Station. After that they threw grenades at BMC Office and moved to Cama Hospital. Terrorists tried to take some hostages in the hospital. They came out on the main road where they shot dead the ATS chief, HemantKarkare and other police officials, who were coming in a Toyota Qualis vehicle. Two terrorists tried to escape but faced cross fire from police. The police injured and captured one terrorist. The other died near Metro Cinema.\nAnother group of terrorists opened fire on occupants of Leopold Cafe, Colaba (at a distance of 2.5\u00a0km from CST). They took some hostages including a Jewish couple. Later, the group holed itself up inside Nariman House after taking hostages while another group forced themselves inside the lobby of Hotel Taj (at 0.5\u00a0km from Nariman House). They threw grenades and fired on the people inside the hotel lobby. Later, they moved onto the third floor and took some hostages including foreigners. They tried to blast the dome of the hotel and set the hotel on fire through grenade blast. Yet another group of terrorists entered into the lobby of Hotel Trident Oberai (at 1.5\u00a0km from CST) and started indiscriminate firing at different locations such as pool side/upper floors and took hostages. Two taxies carrying explosives exploded and killed its drivers and inmates in WadiBunder and Vile Parle area.\nIn a major operation, the National Security Guards (NSG) neutralized all the terrorists holed up in Taj Hotel, Oberoi-Trident and Nariman House, Mumbai. The NSG completed the sanitization of Nariman House and Oberoi-Trident Hotel on November 29, 2008, Hotel Taj on early morning of November 30. \nIn the attack, 175 persons were killed (Police-18, Public-122, Foreigners-26 and terrorists-9) and 291 were injured (Police-25,Public-243 Foreigners-22 and terrorist-1).\nThe multiple terrorist attacks in Mumbai were launched from Karachi from where a group of 10 Laskhar-e-Taiba (LeT) fidayeens (all Pakistanis) equipped with arms/ammunition had sailed off on November 23,2008. \nA new militant outfit called Deccan Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the attack. Investigations have revealed that the sender of the email was connected to Zarrar Shah Communication, Coordinator of LeT based in Pakistan. One of the perpetrators namely Ajmal belonging to district Okara of Pakistan, who was captured, revealed in his interrogation his LeT connections and other details about the attack. According to him, the operation was planned by Zaki-ur-Rehman of LeT.\nNine terrorists killed in the operations by the security forces in Mumbai have been identified by Ajmal as his fidayeen associates from LeT.\nConviction of Mohd Amir MohdAjmalKasab and death penalty.\nSpecial Court, Mumbai convicted Mohd Amir MohdAjmalKasab (case no. 175/2009) and awarded him a death sentence on May 6, 2010. Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court of India upheld the death penalty. The President of India rejected the mercy petition of Ajmal Kasab. Ajmal Kasab was hanged on November 21,2012 at 7:30\u00a0am at Yerwada jail, Pune. \nAcquittal of Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin.\nIn the same case, The Trial Court acquitted two Indian accused viz.

Volta also studied what we now call capacitance, developing separate means to study both electrical potential V and charge Q, and discovering that for a given object they are proportional. This may be called Volta's Law of Capacitance, and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt. Around 1791 he began to study \"animal electricity\". In this way he discovered Volta's Law of the electrochemical series, and the law that the electromotive force (emf formula_1) of a galvanic cell. In 1800, he invented the \"voltaic pile\", an early electric battery, which made a steady electric current. It is credited as the first electrochemical cell.\nIn honor of his work in the field of electricity, Napoleon Bonaparte made him a count in 1810. A museum in Como, the Voltian Temple, has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments. In 1881, an important electrical unit, the volt(V), was named in his honor. There have also been innovations and discoveries named after Alessandro Volta including the Chevy Volt, and the Volta Crater on the Moon.\nVolta married the daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini, Teresa. They raised three sons. In 1779 he became professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia. He had the job for almost 25 years. Volta is buried in the city of Como.

UHF is commonly used for television signals. It is strong enough to be protected from other signal, but because of its strong directivity, receiving error by an obstacle occurs more.

It is built for a particular use instead of for general-purpose use. Digital circuits are a common form of ASIC, but analog ASICs were manufactured beginning in the latter half of the 1990s.\nASIC has advantages compared to Programmable Logic Device or Standard Logic IC. \nThere are also disadvantages of ASIC. \nDesign.\nDesign of ASIC is gate array design, cell base design, embedded array design, standard cell design, and structured ASIC design.\nGate array design has elementary gate circuit at first base, (we) manufacture the products with putting ordered proper wire-layers.\nManufacturing is quick because a finished product needs only production of wire-layers and it is cheap because of mass production of its foundation.\nHowever, because (we) form a circuit with formation of standard gate, it has worse contact rate and efficiency.\nCell base design uses wire-layer between block that was designed and arranged and logical circuit. and product is manufactured .\nPerformance is better than gate array, but time of making cell base is longer than time of making gate array, and cost of making cell base is more expensive than cost of making gate array.\nEmbedded array design Use finished functional block were located. It was rest of theory for wired to use part of gate array. It was called that gate array and basis of cell were compromising.\nStandard cell design is a general term for gate array, cell base, embedded array. if standard cell is cell base IC, direction is different each company.\nStructured ASIC design uses customization of standard subsystems to speed design and production.\nDesigners of ASIC use a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL to describe the functionality of the design.

The effect is based on the idea that electromagnetic radiation is made of a series of particles called photons. When a photon hits an electron on a metal surface, the electron can be emitted. The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons. The effect is also called the Hertz Effect, because it was discovered by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, but this name is not used often.\nThe photoelectric effect has helped physicists understand the quantum nature of light and electrons. The concept of wave\u2013particle duality was developed because of the photoelectric effect. Albert Einstein proposed the Laws of Photoelectric Effect and won the Nobel Prize For Physics 1921.\nMechanism.\nNot every electromagnetic wave will cause the photoelectric effect, only radiation of a certain frequency or higher will cause the effect. The minimum frequency needed is called the \"cutoff frequency\" or \"threshold frequency'. The cutoff frequency is used to find the work function, formula_1, which is the amount of energy holding the electron to the metal surface. The work function is a property of the metal and is not affected by the incoming radiation. If a frequency of light strikes the metal surface that is greater than the cutoff frequency, then the emitted electron will have some kinetic energy.\nThe energy of a photon causing the photoelectric effect is found through formula_2, where formula_3 is Planck's constant, J\u00b7s, formula_4 is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, formula_5 is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron and formula_1 is the work function for the metal. If the photon has a lot of energy, Compton scattering (~ thousands of eV) or pair production (~ millions of eV) may take place.\nThe intensity of the light alone does not cause ejection of electrons. Only light of the cut off frequency or higher can do that. However, increasing the intensity of light will increase the number of electrons being emitted, as long as the frequency is above the cut off frequency.\nHistory.\nHeinrich Hertz made the first observation of the photoelectric effect in 1887. He reported that a spark jumped more readily between two charged spheres if light was shining on them. Further studies were done to learn about the effect observed by Hertz. In 1902, Philipp Lenard showed that the kinetic energy of a photoelectron does not depend on the light intensity. However, it was not until 1905 that Einstein proposed a theory that explained the effect fully. The theory says that electromagnetic radiation is a series of particles, called photons. The photons collide with the electrons on the surface and emit them. This theory ran against the belief that electromagnetic radiation was a wave. Thus, at first it was not recognised as correct. In 1916, Robert Millikan published the results of experiments using a vacuum photo-tube. His work showed that Einstein's photoelectric equation explained the behaviour very accurately. However, Millikan and other scientists were slower to accept Einstein's theory of light quanta. Maxwell's wave theory of electromagnetic radiation cannot explain the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation. These are explained by quantum mechanics."}

The output of image processing can be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. It also means \"Analyzing and manipulating images with a computer\". \nImage processing is performed in three steps:\nFirst, import images with an optical devices like a scanner or a camera, or make them by computer-generated imagery.\nSecond, manipulate or analyze the images in some way. This step can include image improvement and data summary, or the images are analyzed to find rules that aren't seen by the human eyes. For example, meteorologists use this processing to analyze satellite photographs.\nLast, output the result of image processing. The result might be the image changed by some way or it might be a report based on analysis or result of the images.\nIn the 21st century image processing is usually \"digital\", but optical and analog image methods are still used."}
