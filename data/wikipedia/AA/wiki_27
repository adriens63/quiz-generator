The pedal on the right (operated by the player's right foot) sustains the sound of the notes for as long as the pedal is depressed. It does this by lifting the dampers from the strings. Some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well (\"in sympathy\").\nThe pedal on the left makes the sound quieter. It is called the \"una corda\" pedal (Italian for \"one string\"). This is because, in the early days of the piano, the una corda pedal made all the hammers move over so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three (most notes on a piano each have three strings to make a bigger sound). On modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of just one. They also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer, away from the grooves which get worn in the hammerhead. On an upright piano the una corda pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard.\nOn pianos which have a middle pedal (called a sostenuto pedal) any note or chord which the player is holding down when the pedal is pressed will be sustained, but any more notes he plays afterwards will not be affected.\nOrgan.\nOn pipe organs there is a pedalboard with pedals which play notes in the same way that the fingers are playing notes. An organ pedalboard usually has two and a half octaves of notes. These are low notes written in the bass clef. An organist has to learn to play with the feet at the same time as with the hands. He uses the toes or the heels of his shoes. It is even possible to play four notes at once (four part chords) but this is very difficult and usually found in some modern French music.\nHarp.\nThere are seven pedals on a concert harp. Each pedal can be in a high, middle or low position. The strings of the harp can be thought of like the white notes of a piano, tuned to naturals (C,D,E etc.). Each pedal can change one of the letter-named notes one semitone higher or lower. For example: the pedal on the left changes all the Ds to D flat (if the pedal is in the highest position) or D sharp (in the lowest position). From left to right the pedals operate the Ds, Cs, Bs, Es, Fs, Gs and As.\nTimpani.\nPedal timpani are timpani with a pedal which will tighten or loosen the drumhead. This will make the note go up or down in pitch. It is a fairly new invention. Composers in the Classical music period never had pedal timpani. Their timpani always had to be tuned by hand using the taps around the side. Composers like B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k wrote for pedal timpani.\nHarpsichord.\nModern harpsichords often have pedals which change the sound in the same way that stops on an organ change the sound. In earlier harpsichords the sound was more often changed by pushing in or pulling out hand stops."}

People who have alcoholism are called alcoholics. \nAlcoholism is a disease. It often gets worse over time, and can kill a person. However, alcoholism can be treated.\nAlcohol is the most commonly used drug in the world. Around the world, there are at least 208 million people with alcoholism. \nAlcoholism is a condition with a social stigma. Because of this, alcoholics often feel ashamed of their drinking. They may try to hide their drinking, avoid getting help, or refuse to believe that they are alcoholics, because they are too ashamed.\nDiagnosis.\nBeing an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol. It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink. No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking.\nTo be diagnosed with alcoholism, a person has to have three of these symptoms in the past year:\nThere is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic. There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person \"may\" be an alcoholic. These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers).\nAlcoholism causes many problems.\nProblems in the body.\nAlcoholism can cause many health problems. For example, it can cause:\nIf a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning. This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death.\nIn 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world. This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use.\nProblems in life.\nAlcoholism can also cause many problems in alcoholics' lives. These include:\nAlcohol withdrawal.\nIf an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal.\nThe most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called \"DTs\"). Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Many people who get the DTs die from them.\nThis does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking. It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking. Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking.\nEpidemiology.\nIn 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world. (This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.) In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world. This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics. \nAround the world.\nPeople in developed countries drink the most alcohol.p.4 \nAlcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Here is a list of all the areas in the world. It is in order from the areas where alcoholism is most common to the areas where it is least common:p.21\nThere are many reasons why alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Some of these reasons include religion, culture, laws, and people's attitudes about drinking. For example, on average, people in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and islands in the Indian Ocean drink less than people anywhere else in the world.p.4 These are areas where many people are Muslims. Many Muslims in these areas do not drink any alcohol, because the Koran says not to.p.4 In some of these countries, drinking alcohol is illegal. \nHowever, in other areas, like Western Europe, alcohol is a part of daily life. It is legal and easy to get. People very commonly drink alcohol with meals. Very few people drink no alcohol. People's attitudes about alcohol are very different than attitudes in mostly Muslim countries. This is an example of how differences in religion, culture, laws, and attitudes about drinking can affect the amount of alcohol use and alcoholism in different areas. \nMen and women.\nAlcoholism is more common in men than in women. However, in the past few decades, the number of female alcoholics has increased. \nFemale alcoholics are most common in the Americas and Europe. In the United States and Western Europe, five to ten percent of women will become alcoholics at some point in their lives.\nIn the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific areas, less than 1% of women are alcoholics. In Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean area, almost no women are alcoholics.p.21\nYoung people.\nIn many countries, young people are using more and more alcohol. In a 2008 WHO survey, underage drinking had increased in 71% of countries. Drinking by young adults (ages 18-25) had increased in 80% of countries.p.10\nTreatment options.\nAlcoholism can be treated. There are many forms of treatment for alcoholism.\nDetoxification.\nDetoxification (detox) is often the first step in treating alcoholism. \"Detoxification\" means \"getting toxins out of the body.\" Alcohol detoxification means that the alcoholic stops drinking, so that alcohol (a toxin) can get out of their body. The alcoholic also needs to give their body time to recover from not having alcohol any more.\nIt is not safe for an alcoholic to suddenly stop drinking on their own. The safest way to stop drinking is to go to a hospital that specializes in alcohol detoxification. These hospitals are often called \"detoxes\" or \"rehabs.\" These places can make sure that an alcoholic has a safe detox. They can also give medications to make the alcoholic more comfortable, and to prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The most common medications that doctors give during alcohol detox are benzodiazepines.p.35\nOnce a person stops drinking alcohol, they are called \"sober\". Most people need other treatments to help them stay sober.\nDetox can be an intense process, and some people experience very strong emotions during it. This is complicated by the fact that, in the past, they may have used drugs or alcohol to help them handle strong emotions. In detox, the therapist helps them manage their emotions.\nTherapy.\nPsychotherapy and group therapy can help alcoholics stay sober. For example, they can help alcoholics learn how to:\nMedications.\nSome medications can help alcoholics stay sober. These medications include:pp.130-144\nVitamins.\nMany alcoholics do not have enough vitamins in their body. This can cause serious problems. For example, if an alcoholic does not have enough thiamine, they can get brain damage. Often, alcoholics are treated with thiamine to prevent brain damage. They may also be given other vitamins if needed.p.144\nGroups for alcoholics.\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the biggest support and mutual aid group for alcoholics in the world. This means that in AA groups, alcoholics come together to support each other and help each other recover. AA uses a twelve-step program. This program is meant to help alcoholics fix the problems their alcoholism has caused.\nThere are also other groups for alcoholics, like:\nOther websites.\nHelp for alcoholism.\nGroups for alcoholics and their families"}

It is a part of World War II that started years before the other parts. The war ended when Japan surrendered unconditionally after two nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States.\nInvasion of China.\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War began when Japan invaded China in 1931. Japan used the Mukden Incident as an excuse to invade China. The invasion grew into a full-scale war after the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident. Japanese officers said that a Japanese soldier got lost and they were allowed to find him in Beiping. \nJapan invaded China for a few reasons:\nWhile the Imperial Japanese Army was trying to take over China, the KMT (the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong) cooperated a little to try to fight off Japan together. This was called the \"Chinese United Front\". However, for the most part, they continued to fight each other as well. \nJapanese occupation of China.\nIn 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army began to occupy China, starting in the northeast (Manchuria), where they created a puppet state called Manchukuo. In 1937, they occupied Beiping (now called Beijing), and then Nanjing. For six weeks in Nanjing, the army committed the Nanjing Massacre. During this massacre, Japanese soldiers killed between 40,000 and 300,000 Chinese people, and raped at least 20,000 women and girls. \nAfter six weeks, the Japanese Army left Nanjing. It finally occupied the industrial cities in southern China. Chiang moved his capital city from Nanjing to Chongqing, and began a tactic of \"using space to trade for time.\" He was able to spread Japanese soldiers out too thin. This means they were covering too much space with too few soldiers. This made them harder to fight, and made it easier for partisans to fight back in occupied China.\nMany soldiers died on both sides at this time. However, in 1940, the Japanese Army stopped being able to move farther into China and take more land. 1940 also marked the point where China began to be able to fight back, instead of Japan continuing to take over the country.\nEnd of the war.\nAfter Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 7, 1941, the Second Sino-Japanese War became part of World War II. It became a part of the area of fighting called the China-Burma-India theatre. The entrance of the United States into the war in Asia meant that the Chinese military forces started receiving lend-lease supplies from the British and Americans over the Burma Road. This helped the Chinese fight back and get much-needed modern weapons. \nThe Second Sino-Japanese War had damaged Japan. It had not been able to win the war against China quickly. Instead, Japan's military had already been fighting China for four years. This made it much more difficult for Japan to keep fighting (now in the Pacific against the Allied forces). This may have been one reason why Japan eventually lost the war.\nIn China, the war had some important effects. It made more people support the Chinese Communist Party. It also made Chiang's Republic fall apart more quickly, in 1949."}

Ligaments join bones to other bones to form a joint. They do \"not\" connect muscles to bones; that is the function of tendons. Some ligaments limit the amount of movement in a joint, or stop certain movements altogether. \nLigaments are only slightly elastic; when under tension, they gradually lengthen. This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened. Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple. \nThe result of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be joined."}

A county is part of a larger unit called a \"voivodship\" (in Polish, \"wojew\u00f3dztwo\". One would call it in English \"province\").\nNames.\nMost Polish counties are named after their capital city, or county seat. \nIf a county seat has a double-barreled name, as with \"Mak\u00f3w Mazowiecki,\" the county may become either \"Mak\u00f3w County\" or \"Mak\u00f3w-Mazowiecki County.\" Due, in all but the first case, to the existence, respectively, of two \"double-barreled\" county seats with the identical noun name, the corresponding adjectives \"\"bielski\",\" \"\"grodziski\",\" \"\"ostrowski\" and \"tomaszowski\"\" each denote \"two\" distinct counties.\nHistory and functioning.\nSome Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the \"urban county\" (\"powiat grodzki\"), similar in local administration and self-governance to \"land counties.\" An average county (the largest being the powiat of Bia\u0142ystok) comprises 5 \u2013 8 communes. The largest urban county, in terms of population and area, is the city of Warsaw. \nThe history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795. \nIn the 19th century, the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (\"Congress Poland\"), and as the Polish equivalent of the German \"Kreis\" in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Pozna\u0144. \nAfter Poland regained independence in 1918, the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland. \"Powiat\"s (counties) were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships, but were reintroduced in 1999. There are now 314 \"land counties\" (\"powiat ziemski\") and 65 \"urban counties\" (\"powiat grodzki\"), more formally \"municipalities with county status\" (\"miasto na prawach powiatu\")."}

The women's bodies were found floating in the Tampa Bay, Tampa in June 1989. They had been bound and gagged and then tossed into the bay with concrete blocks tied to their necks while still alive.\nBillboards where at the later stages of the investigation used in trying to find however did the murders, the billboards that was spread all over Tampa had pictures of the Rogers women and a picture of the hand-writing of the suspected triple murderer. This method had never been used before, and became useful in searches for missing people later on.\nChandler was arrested in September 1992. He was put on trial where he was found guilty of the murders by a 12-member jury. In November 4, 1994 he was sentenced to death by a deadly injection by the judge in the case. Before his execution, Chandler was locked up at Union Correctional Institution in Florida. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer Prize for his article series Angels &amp; Demons which told the story of the murders.\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nOba Chandler was born in Cincinnati in the state of Ohio. He was the fourth of five children. His parents were Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson. At the age of 10, Chandler's father Oba Chandler Senior hanged himself in the Chandler family's basement. This upset Oba so much that he jumped into his father's grave during the funeral in 1957 while gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt. Afterwards, Oba's life spun out of control and he was arrested many times and had been arrested 20 times by the time he was a teenager. As an adult, he was charged with a long list of crimes, including theft, having fake money, burglary, kidnapping and armed robbery. Chandler would also father a total of eight children before his arrest, the latest one being Whitney born in February, 1989 with his wife at the time Debra Chandler. Between May and September of 1991 Chandler worked as an informant for the US customs Tampa office, at the same time as Tampa police investigated the Rogers family triple murder.\nFacts of the murders.\nJoan Rogers and her two daughters, Michelle (17 years of age) and Christe (14 years of age) left their family dairy farm on May 26, 1989 in Willshire for a vacation in Florida.\n They had never before left the state of Ohio. On their last day in Florida they became lost and drove into Tampa to ask for directions to the nearest hotel, in a store they came across Oba Chandler and asked him. It is thought that he saw the Ohio state car license plates on Joan's car and used that as means to ask the family to join him out for a boat trip later.\nThe discovery of the bodies.\nThe women's bodies were discovered floating in the Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989 with bound hands and feet with concrete blocks tied to their necks and duct tape over their mouths. The first body was found floating over the Sunshine Skyway bridge when a sailboat on its way home to Tampa after a trip to Key West, had just crossed under the Sunshine Skyway when many people on board saw an object in the water. They soon realized it was a dead body of a female. Soon another body was found and yet another third body was also dragged out of the bay within an hour. All three bodies had been tied and gagged and had concrete blocks tied around their necks. Autopsies thought the women had been tossed into the bay while still alive.\nInvestigation.\nSubsequent investigaton.\nThe Rogers women where identified a week after their bodies where found in the bay. A hotel maid had discovered that a hotel room had stood unused for several days. And when the reports about the murders started to leap into the media the hotel decided to contact investigators in the case. Soon it stood clear that it was indeed the families room after fingerprints where matched to those of the victims, some snaphots from a camera was also discovered in the room which showed where the family had traveled and also a last shot over Tampa Bay. This photo was taken just minutes before the Rogers women went out to meet Oba Chandler to go on a boat ride out on the bay.\nIncriminating fact and arrest.\nThe case remained unsolved and cold for several years, partly due to the volume of tips pouring in to the police who investigated the crime.\nChandler would not be arrested for the murders until September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions and palmprint on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, along with a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to his being named a suspect. Also, authorities had posted the handwriting from the brochure on billboards, which was historic as it was used for the first time in an attempt to find the unknown killer, and this led to a tip from a former neighbor who was able to provide a copy of a work order that Chandler had written. A handwriting analysis conclusively matched the two.\nSentence and aftermath.\nThe Rogers women were all buried on June 13, 1989 after a funeral service at the Zion Lutheral Church in their hometown of Willshire, Ohio. About 300 people among them family and friends of the victims attended the service. Numerous police officers were also present to keep all news media and crews out of the church during the funeral service, this because of the huge media interest for the case by media at the time. Chandler was tried and found guilty of the murders, and sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. After sentencing, the jury forewoman commented regarding the death sentence that \"They need to do this swiftly. The man is a mutation of a human being and he needs to be destroyed.\" In July 2008, it was revealed that Chandler was on Florida's short-list of executions.\nProfiling experts believe that Chandler may have killed previously, based on the speculation that a first-time killer would not be experienced or bold enough to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remains a suspect in a 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island, he is also a suspect in a rape case concerning a Canadian woman weeks before the Rogers women's murder. However, Chandler has never been charged with other murders. Chandler got an Institutional Adjustment disciplinary report on December 15, 2001, for disobeying orders in prison. All of Chandler's appeals since his 1994 conviction have been denied, the latest one in May 2007. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer prize for his article series Angels &amp; Demons which told the story of the murders.\nExecution.\nOba Chandler was executed on November 15, 2011 with a lethal injection at 4:25\u00a0pm in Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida."}

{"id": "60166", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60166", "title": "Origami", "text": "Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It uses many techniques and various objects can be created. The object is made of origami paper, which is specially made for folding and staying in shape. Many dictionaries and television shows suggest that origami is only paper cranes, waterbombs, and paper planes, but many new models and creatures have been made because new folding techniques have allowed this.\nWhen the Japanese first folded origami, they used only one piece of paper. A different kind of origami called \"modular origami\" uses many small pieces that are the same, which are combined to form one large model. Also, many mathematical shapes can be made with origami.\nHistory.\nThe beginnings of origami are not clear. Paperfolding started in China in the 1st or 2nd century. It finally came to Japan in the 6th century. Instead of making models that looked exactly like things, the first origami models only looked similar to things. People often folded models and gave them to other people for good luck. For example, Shinto nobles celebrated weddings with sake in glasses decorated with origami butterflies, which gave good luck to the bride and groom.\nThere were also independent paperfolding traditions in other countries, like Germany and Spain. The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a boat in 1490. There was also a paper box from 1440. Finally, in 1845, \"Kan no mado\" was written, and it was the first book of origami models.\nRecently, people have become more interested in origami. In 1954, Japanese paperfolder Akira Yoshizawa created rules to explain how to fold origami models. His instructions on paperfolding are now used in all countries.\nPaper.\nPeter Engel, who is a well-known paperfolder, says \"the best paper [for origami] is thin and crisp and absolutely square.\" Pre-cut origami paper is sold in many colors, sizes, and patterns. Duo paper, or paper with different colors on each side, is used by paperfolders because it makes areas of different color on the finished model. There are also special papers, like textured, metallic, and patterned.\nMany people like to make their own paper. Engel describes a process shown to him by Robert Lang that is \"a sandwich of aluminum foil and two pieces of tissue paper.\" In this method, two pieces of paper are pasted to each side of the aluminum foil. Many people like origami because there is almost always paper. Copy paper, napkins, wallpaper, index cards, and even paper money can be used to make interesting and unique models.\nTools.\nMany paperfolders prefer to use a flat surface to fold models on, but others, like the Japanese, fold in the air. Traditional paperfolders believe that only the hands should be used when folding, but many modern folders use other tools when folding. Tweezers and paper clips can be used to make very small folds. Some folders use rulers or other flat tools to make sharper creases in the models.\nTypes.\nNew types of origami have been made because more people are making origami models.\nPureland.\nPureland origami is origami with one rule: only one fold can be made at a time. British paperfolder John Smith started pureland origami for inexperienced paperfolders or for people with poor motor skills. Hard folds, like the inside-reverse fold, are not allowed in pureland origami."}

The first polyhedra are the tetrahedron, which is made of four triangles, pentahedron (five faces, can look like a four-sided pyramid), hexahedron (six faces, a cube if it is regular), heptahedron (seven faces) and octahedron (eight faces).

The Croatian language consists of three vernaculars (Kaikavian, Chakavian and Shtokavian). \nCroatian grammar books show that the codification of the language started at the beginning of the 17th century (the first grammar was written by Bartol Ka\u0161i\u0107 in Latin in 1604). This means that the rules for the language were written down. From 1604 to 1836 there were 17 grammars. Most of them described the \u0160tokavian dialect, but some were about Kajkavian. In the 19th century, more grammars based on \u0160tokavian were written. They were \"Nova ricsoslovnica illiricka\", written by \u0160ime Star\u010devi\u0107 (1812), and \"Grammatik der illyrischen Sprache\", written by Ignjat Alojzije Brli\u0107 (1833). Even before the 19th century, the three dialects of the Croatian language were almost equally used. However, the way each dialect was written down varied throughout Croatia. Near the Adriatic coast, it was more similar to Italian, and near the Hungarian border, it was more similar to Hungarian. \nAll grammars of the above period (1604-1836) used three accents: acute, grave and circumflex, Star\u010devi\u0107's grammar is an exception as it uses a system of four accents.\nIn 19th century, Ljudevit Gaj proposed new letters from Czech (\u010d,\u017e,\u0161,\u013e,\u0148,\u010f and \u01e7). The letters that were accepted were \u010d, \u017e and \u0161, and from Polish, \u0107. For other phonemes (sounds), the digraphs that were accepted were ie, lj, nj and d\u017e. Later dj or gj was changed to \u0111 (according to proposal by \u0110uro Dani\u010di\u0107).\nOrthography.\nThe Croatian language uses a Latin script of 30 letters and one diphthong \"ie\" or \"ije\", and \"\u0155\". This system is called \"gajica\" in Croatian (or Croatian Gaj's Latin alphabet). The name came from Ljudevit Gaj. The letter order (and whole alphabet) is called \"abeceda\" in Croatian, because the first 4 letters are spelled \"a, be, ce, de\". For writing foreign names and words, and in some professions, the Croatian language uses letters which do not belong to \"gajica\", like \"X, x (iks), Y,y (ipsilon)\" and others.\nCroatian alphabet (Gaica) 1830.c\nGrammatical cases.\nIn Croatian, nouns change form depending on the composition of the sentence. This is called declension. For people who are learning Croatian, declension is the most difficult part of the language to master. It is very complicated and time consuming to explain it and because of that we will use simpler techniques. However, many languages have noun and pronoun declension, including English. In English, though, only pronoun declension now remains. Let us start by explaining all of the seven Croatian grammatical cases. The technique that is most frequently used in determining grammatical cases (the same technique is used in Croatian schools when taught to children) is by asking yourself a question when you are trying to figure out which case a noun should be in. In Croatian, grammatical cases are called pade\u017ei (plural) and pade\u017e (singular). \nThe question you will ask yourself here is: \u201cWhere is Kre\u0161imir going?\u201d. And the answer is that he's going to school. By looking at the table below you will see that the question 'where' is used for the Locative case.\nGender.\nCroatian nouns are divided into three genders: the masculine, feminine and neuter gender. To know a noun's gender is very important because it affects all the words in a sentence that are tied to the noun, such as adjectives. A gender is determined by the noun's ending (with some exceptions). This makes it easier to tell what gender a noun is without memorizing the gender of every word. See the table below.\nNouns retain their gender in plural. For instance, even though the noun '\u017eene' (women) ends in -e, it is of the feminine gender.\nGrammatical aspects.\nCroatian verbs have two grammatical aspects: the perfective and imperfective. The perfective aspect depicts an action that has already been finished. The imperfective aspect depicts an action that is still continuing. So, each verb in its infinitive form can be written in 2 ways: in its perfective and imperfective aspect. The table below is showing 5 verbs both in their perfective and imperfective aspects.\nGrammatical tenses.\nIn Croatian, there are seven grammatical tenses. They can be divided in two ways: by the time they take place in and by their complexity. Simple tenses consist of only 1 word (simple tenses are aorist, imperfect, and present) while complex tenses consist of 2 or even 3 words (complex tenses are pluperfect, perfect, first future, second future) because they also consist of auxiliary verbs. Also, some grammatical tenses cannot be formed with both grammatical aspects, they work with only one aspect.\nCommon phrases.\nThe Croatian week starts with Monday and ends with Sunday, unlike weeks from some other countries, where Sunday is the first day and Saturday the last."}

It means every person who has ever accepted or ever will accept the Christian Faith. The idea is that all these people together make up one \"body\" called \"the Church\". \"The Church\" (in this sense) is not thought of by Christians as an ordinary human organisation. It is thought of as being part of God's way to bring people close to him. \"The Church\" was begun by Jesus in the 1st century AD. It is called \"The Christian Church\" because Jesus was called \"The Christ\" (or holy one from God).\nToday there are many churches in the sense of \"church organisations\". The different organised churches are called Christian denominations.\nThe main Christian beliefs are held by all major Christian denominations. These beliefs are often said aloud by Christian people in a \"statement of faith\" which is called the Creed. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican Communion and other Protestant churches all believe that God is the \"creator and eternal father of all things\", that Jesus was the \"Christ\" and son of God who died to save people from the punishment for their sins, and that the Holy Spirit is God's gift to help and comfort Christian people. Christians believe that these are three parts of One God.\nThere are many other beliefs that are different between different denominations. These differences have sometimes caused arguments and have caused the organised church to split into denominations. The different opinions are called controversies.\nDuring Late Antiquity, the Christian Church started became the most important persecuting organization in human history.\nTerminology.\nThe English word \"church\" comes from the Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae (kyriake) meaning \"Master's (house)\", or \"Lord's (house)\". In modern English the word \"church\" is used for both a church building and \"the Christian Church\" throughout the world.\nIn 381 AD, at the a meeting of bishops known as the First Council of Constantinople, the Nicene Creed (a statement of beliefs) that was used at the time was changed to include a description of the Church. The words that were added to the Nicene Creed are \"One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church\". This important addition describes the four most important things that Christians were to believe about the Christian Church.\nThese are the four words that are used in the Nicene Creed: \nControversies.\nOne important controversy is simply the definition of the Christian or Catholic Church. To some degree this controversy comes from the Nicene Creed with its words \"One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church\" which means \"universal\" church. Many denominations believe that all denominations are part of a world-wide Christian Church and think that the most important thing is the \"common faith\" and not a common organisation or tradition. (\"Common faith\" means \"the faith that is the same\". The word \"common\" does not mean \"ordinary\" in this sense.)\nFor many hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has regarded itself as the only Christian Church and has called itself the \"Catholic\" (or \"universal\") church. In other words, only those people who were within the \"organisation\" of the Roman Catholic Church were believed to belong to the \"Universal Church\". In the 20th century this view began to change and in the late 20th century there was a strong movement within parts of the Roman Catholic Church to reach out to other denominations. The Eastern Orthodox Church has thought of itself in the same way, but in the late 20th century there has been much more discussion between the Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. Some smaller denominations such as Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that they are the one and only true Christian Church."}

Christianity is divided into ten main groups. These groups all branched out at different dates from the early Christianity founded by the followers of Jesus. The splits generally happened because they could not agree on certain beliefs or practices. The groups then divided into smaller groups. Each group that has its own separate name is a \"denomination\". The word \"denomination\" means \"Being given a name\u201d \nDenominations.\nWorldwide Christianity is divided into 10 major groups :\nEach of these ten has important subdivisions. There are also other (smaller) groups that are not mentioned here.\nThe Evangelical and Nontrinitarian branches of Christianity are much more divided up than any of the others. Each separate Evangelical church is often called a \"denomination\". While the Roman Catholic Church looks to a single earthly leader, the Pope, and has similar beliefs right across the world, the several Protestant denominations do not look to a single leader and sometimes have beliefs that are very different from each other. \nMany Christian denomination see themselves as part of the worldwide Church which includes other denominations as well. Some denominations, such as the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches and some Protestant Churches, believe that they are the \"only\" true Christian church. \nSome denominations have beliefs which almost all the other denominations would disagree with, very strongly. These beliefs are called \"heresy\" by the other churches. \nThere were some movements considered heresies by the early church which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations. Examples include the Gnostics (who had believed in an esoteric dualism), the Ebionites (who venerated Christ's blood relatives), and the Arians. The greatest divisions in Christianity today, however, are between Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and various denominations formed during and after the Protestant Reformation. There also exists in Protestantism and Orthodoxy various degrees of unity and division.\nComparisons between denominations must be approached with caution. For example, some churches are part of a larger church organization or diocese, while in other groups, each congregation is an independent organization. This issue is further complicated by the existence of groups of congregations with a common heritage that are officially nondenominational and have no centralized authority or records, but which are identified as denominations by non-adherents. Study of such churches in denominational terms is therefore a more complex proposition.\nNumerical comparisons are also problematic. Some groups count membership based on adult believers and baptized children of believers, while others only count adult baptized believers. Others may count membership based on those adult believers who have formally affiliated themselves with the congregation. In addition, there may be political motives of advocates or opponents of a particular group to inflate or deflate membership numbers through propaganda or outright deception."}

The total figure does not include independent Catholic denominations (18 million).\nIndependent Catholicism \u2013 18 million.\nVarious denominations self-identifying as Catholic, despite not being affiliated with the Catholic Church.\nProtestantism \u2013 900 million.\nProtestantism is the second largest major group of Christians by number of followers. Estimates vary from 800 million to a billion, or nearly 40% of all Christians. The main reason for this wide range is the lack of a common agreement among scholars as to which denominations constitute Protestantism. For instance, most sources but not all include Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists and Independent Nondenominational Christianity as part of Protestantism. Moreover, Protestant denominations altogether do not form a single structure comparable to the Catholic Church, or to a lesser extent the Eastern Orthodox Communion. However, several different comparable communions exist within Protestantism, such as the Anglican Communion, World Communion of Reformed Churches, World Baptist Alliance, World Methodist Council and the World Lutheran Federation. Regardless, 900 million is the most accepted figure among various authors and scholars, and thus is used in this article. Note that this 900 million figure also includes Anglicanism, as well as Anabaptists, Baptists and multiple other groups that might sometimes disavow a common \"Protestant\" designation, and would rather prefer to be called, simply, \"Christian\".\nHistorical Protestantism \u2013 300\u2013400 million.\nThe number of individuals who are members of historical Protestant Churches totals to 300-400 million.\nAnglicanism \u2013 110 million.\nThere are about 110 million Christians in Anglican tradition, mostly part of the Anglican Communion, the third largest Christian denomination in the world.\nBaptist churches \u2013 75\u2013105 million.\nThe number of individuals who hold membership in the Baptist denomination totals to 75-105 million, being represented in the following Churches:\nLutheranism \u2013 70\u201390 million.\nThe number of adherents in the Lutheran denomination totals to 70-90 million persons, being represented in the following Churches:\nReformed churches (Calvinism) \u2013 60\u201380 million.\nThe Reformed tradition is represented by 60-80 million people who hold membership in the following Churches:\nMethodism \u2013 60\u201380 million.\nThe number of members in the Methodist denomination totals to 60-80 million people, being represented in the following Churches:\nSeventh-day Adventist Church \u2013 21.4 million.\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church has a membership of 21.4 million people.\nPlymouth Brethren \u2013 1 million.\nThe Plymouth Brethren number around 1 million members.\nModern Protestantism \u2013 400\u2013500 million.\nThe denominations listed below did not emerge from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century or its commonly acknowledged offshoots. Instead, they are broadly linked to Pentecostalism or similar other independent evangelical and revivalistic movements that originated in the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason, several sources tend to differentiate them from Protestants and classify them as together as Independents, Non-core Protestants etc. Also included in this category are the numerous, yet very similar Nondenominational churches. Nonetheless, sources eventually combine their numbers to the Protestant tally. Despite the absence of centralized control or leadership, if considered as a single cohort, this will easily be the second largest Christian tradition after Roman Catholicism. According to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity (CSGC), there are an estimated 450 million Independents world-wide, as of mid-2019.\nPentecostalism \u2013 280 million.\nThose who are members of the Pentecostal denomination number around 280 million people.\nAfrican initiated churches \u2013 60 million.\n60 million people are members of African initiated churches.\nNew Apostolic Church \u2013 10 million.\nThe New Apostolic Church has around 10 million members.\nEastern Orthodoxy \u2013 230 million.\nThe best estimate of the number of Eastern Orthodox Christians is 210\u2013230 million or 80% of all Orthodox Christians worldwide. Its main body consists of the various autocephalous churches along with the autonomous and other churches canonically linked to them, for the most part form a single communion, making the Eastern Orthodox Church the second largest single denomination behind the Catholic Church. In addition, there are several Eastern Orthodox splinter groups and non-universally recognized churches.\nOriental Orthodoxy \u2013 62 million.\nThe Oriental Orthodox Churches are those descended from those that rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Despite the similar name, they are therefore a different branch of Christianity from the Eastern Orthodox (see above). There are an estimated 62 million Oriental Orthodox Christians, worldwide.\nNon-trinitarian Restorationism \u2013 35 million.\nA sixth group is composed by Non-trinitarian Restorationists. These groups are quite distinct from orthodox Trinitarian restorationist groups such as the Disciples of Christ, despite some shared history."}

The word comes from the Latin \"credo\" for \"I believe\". It is called \"symbol\" (Greek, \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd), that means a \"token\" by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other.\nChristian creeds.\nIt is likely that the earliest creed of Christianity that deserves the title in full is the Apostles' Creed. The Apostles' Creed seems to have been formulated to resist Gnosticism; it emphasizes the birth, physical death, and bodily Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It reads:\nThe Nicene Creed is clearly derived from the Apostles' Creed, and represents an elaboration of its basic themes. The most important additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning Christology and the Trinity. \nChristians today probably use the Nicene Creed most widely, followed by the Apostles' Creed.\nJewish Creed: the \"Shmah\".\nThe Jewish faith recognizes a single creed called the Shmah or Shema Yisrael, a statement of faith in strict unitarian monotheism, the belief in one God. This creed is embodied in a single prayer recited twice a day: \"Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One\", also translated as \"Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is unique [\"or\" alone].\"\nIn Hebrew: \u05e9\u05de\u05e2 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3\nThis is pronounced phonetically in Hebrew: \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad\".\nIslamic creeds.\nThe most basic attempt to put the religion of Islam in a brief statement of doctrine is the shahada, the proclamation that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet.\nMore detailed credal declarations of Islamic dogma constitute aqidah.\nThe six Sunni articles of belief are:\nAlso from the Aqidah of the Salaf is the belief that the faith (i.e. Eemaan) consists of (both) speech and action and that it increases and decreases. This differs from the Murji\u2019ah a sect who uphold the belief of \u201cIrjaa\u2019\u201d-to hold that sins major and minor, do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases.\nAnd they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah, His Revelation and Light. It is not created, since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created. One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech. Since His attributes have been with Him eternally, His Speech cannot be created and therefore, the Quran is not created. According to the Salaf, debating about it is disbelief. It is not denied except by a Jahmee. A Jahmee is one who denies Allah\u2019s attributes."}

Institutions are permanent, which means that they do not end when one person is gone. An institution has rules and can enforce rules of human behavior. The word \"institution\" can be used in two ways. It can mean a very broad idea, or a very \"specific\" (narrow) one. For example: \nInstitutions, in the broad sense, are found in every society. The way that each institution works is different in different cultures. Some important institutions are: \nSome societies have many institutions in the \"specific\" sense. These societies have an organised government, schools, hospitals, churches, clubs, armies, markets, courts and places for entertainment. Some societies have very few of these things, but this does not mean that there are no \"institutions\". The way in which the people relate to each other may have just as many \"controls\" as in a society with schools, markets and a government. An example of a society that has lots of \"specific\" institutions is Western Europe. \nHistorians look at institutions to find differences between eras or periods. They sometimes judge political and military events by the effect that they had on institutions."}

It has many thorns. It produces a fruit that is yellow when it is ripe. This fruit is preferred by bartenders to mix cocktails. They prefer this lime, rather than the Persian lime. \nThe lime plant originally came from southeast Asia, where it is native. It was taken to the Middle East, and Crusaders took it to Europe and North Africa. Spanish explorers took it to the West Indies and the Florida Keys. In 1926, a hurricane destroyed most of the commercially-grown limes in the region. The Persian lime was reintroduced then.\nSome of the original shrubs grew wild in the Florida Keys. It became clear that the originally introduced shrubs (now known as \"Mexican limes\") had modified their fruits. These were darker green than the original Persian limes, they also had a thicker skin.\nMore detail.\nIn biological taxonomy, race is an informal rank below the level of subspecies. It may be used as a higher rank than \"strain\". There are various definitions. Races may be genetically distinct populations in the same species, or they may be defined in other ways, e.g. geographically, or physiologically. Genetic isolation between races is not complete (some interbreeding takes place between the groups).\nHowever, the genetic differences are not (yet) enough to put the groups into separate species. The term \"race\" is recognized by some, but is not governed by any of the formal codes of biological classification.\nHuman beings.\nIn former times, scientists often divided human beings into races. For example, they called people with a dark skin \"Negroid\" or \"black race\". But, human gene sequences are very similar compared to many other animals. This is one reason why modern biology says that there is only one human race."}

{"id": "60259", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60259", "title": "Phenotype", "text": "The phenotype of an organism is the whole set of characters (or traits) of that organism.\nIt does not mean just 'what you can see on the surface'. Rather, it means anything which can be made visible by suitable means. For example, blood groups are definitely a part of the phenotype. However, they are not visible just by looking at a person.\nIn biology, the phenotype is distinguished from the genotype. This was proposed by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's heredity and what that heredity produces. The distinction is similar to that proposed by August Weismann, who distinguished between \"germ plasm\" (gametes or their stem cells) and \"somatic cells\" (the body).\nThe phenotype is important because it is exposed to natural selection:\nPhenotypes are determined mainly by genes and are influenced by environmental factors. So, knowing the genome of an organism does not give an exact prediction of its phenotype.\nTraits vary greatly in how much they owe to heredity (nature vs nurture). The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship:\nExtensions.\nThe term 'phenotype' must include characteristics that can be made visible by some technical procedure (such as blood types). Another extension adds behaviour to the phenotype since behaviours are also affected by both genotypic and environmental factors.\nThe idea of the extended phenotype has been developed by Richard Dawkins to mean all the effects a gene has on the outside world that may influence its chances of being inherited. These can be effects on the organism carrying the trait, the environment, or other organisms. For instance, a beaver dam might be considered a phenotype of beaver genes, the same way beavers' powerful incisor teeth are phenotype expressions of their genes. Dawkins also cites the effect of an organism on the behaviour of another organism (such as the devoted nurturing of a cuckoo by a parent clearly of a different species) as an example of the extended phenotype."}

Its Latin name is \"Citrus aurantiifolia\" (often, less correctly: \"C. aurantifolia\"), or \"Citrus\" x \"aurantiifolia\" (Christm.) Swingle. It is also known as the Mexican lime, West Indian lime or Bartender's lime. It is a shrub that grows to about 5m in height. \nIts fruit is 2.5-5 cm in diameter (1-2 in). The fruit is yellow when ripe but usually it is picked green. It is smaller, seedier, has a higher acidity, a stronger aroma, and a thinner rind than that of the more common Persian lime. It is valued for its unique flavor compared to other lime. The Key lime usually has a more tart and bitter flavor. It is perhaps most distinguished as an ingredient in the Key lime pie. \n\"C. aurantiifolia\" is a shrubby tree, that grows to 5 m (16 ft), with many thorns. Dwarf varieties are popular with home growers and can be grown indoors in winter in colder climates. The trunk rarely grows straight, with many branches that often originate quite far down on the trunk. The leaves are ovate 2.5\u20139 cm (1\u20133.5 in) long. They resemble orange leaves (the scientific name \"aurantiifolia\" refers to the leaves' resemblance). The flowers are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. They are yellowish white with a light purple tinge on the margins. Flowers and fruit appear throughout the year but are most abundant from May to September .\n\"C. aurantiifolia\" originally came from Southeast Asia. It was introduced through the Middle East to North Africa and Europe during the Crusades. Spanish explorers then took it to the West Indies (at some point including the Florida Keys) contemporaneously with Columbus, then tropical and sub-tropical North America including Mexico, Florida, and later California . The English name \"lime\" was derived from the Persian name \u0644\u06cc\u0645\u0648 \"Limu\" in this course. \"Key\" would seem to have been added some time after the Persian lime cultivar became more important commercially in the United States. This was after the hurricane of 1926. The hurricane destroyed most U.S. \"C. aurantiifolia\" plants. Some plants growing in the wild in the Keys survived the hurricane. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect, many Key limes are grown in Mexico and Central America. They are also grown in Texas and California."}

In the process, Europeans met people and mapped lands previously unknown to them. Among the most famous explorers of the period were Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, John Cabot, , Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Juan Sebastian Elcano, Bartholomeu Dias, Ferdinand Magellan, Willem Barentsz, Abel Tasman, Jean Alfonse, Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain, Willem Blaeu and Captain James Cook. \nPortuguese Empire.\nHenry the Navigator started by paying Portuguese sailors to explore the west coast of Africa. In 1419 Joao Goncalves Zarco discovered the Madeira Islands. Later in the 15th century, Vasco da Gama reached the southwestern tip of Africa and established the city of Cape Town, a Portuguese colony. This opened the way to the Indian Ocean. In the next two centuries, the Portuguese created a great trading empire on coasts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India. The Portuguese Empire eventually weakened after the Dutch East India Company rose as the major power in Indian Ocean trade. \nSpanish Empire.\nIn a hurry to compete with Portugal for a colonial empire, Spain sent Christopher Columbus to the opposite route of the Portuguese. Instead of going south along the west coast of Africa, Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. He believed that he came to Asia. Later, some Spanish sailors found out that this land was a different continent than Asia. It is now called the Americas.\nIn the 16th century, Spanish conquistadores gained the whole of what later became Latin America, except some British and French colonies in northeastern South America, and Brazil, which belonged to Portugal. The Spanish concentrated on conquest, unlike the Portuguese who focused on trading. They eventually developed a vast colonial empire, in contrast to the Portuguese who ruled a few islands and coastal cities along the Indian Ocean. When Spain and Portugal were united under King Philip II of Spain , their combined empire was the largest on earth.\nIn 1522 the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan returned to Spain. The survivors were the first ever to sail all the way around the world.\nBritain, France, and the Netherlands.\nIn the 17th century, political and religious wars with Britain, France, and the Netherlands weakened the Iberian Peninsula. These three nations emerged as the main winners of the wars and became major powers like Spain and Portugal. In the next two centuries, the world became a battlefield of the three nations. Britain and France held land in North America, in India and other distant places. The Dutch colonized smaller parts of the Americas, took the former Portuguese trading centers around the Indian Ocean, and conquered Indonesia. These three new great powers also had influence all around the world.\nEventually, the result was a series of wars that were fought both in Europe and overseas, with Britain emerging victorious. The British took the former land of French Canada and India in the 18th century. They seized power in the Indian Ocean and defeated the Dutch navy. By 1763, the British Empire had become the second global empire after Spain. However, in 1776, thirteen colonies of British America declared independence. With help from the French, Dutch and Spanish, they defeated Britain in the American Revolution.\nExploration of the Southern Pacific Ocean.\nIn 1778, Captain James Cook of Britain sailed across the South Pacific Ocean looking for a mysterious continent in the Southern Hemisphere. He landed on two large islands. Then he sailed west and found a bigger piece of land. The first, was modern New Zealand; the second was Australia. Captain Cook claimed these lands for Britain. He then explored the Pacific world for another year and died in a fight with the Hawaiians.\nEffects of the Age of Discovery.\nMany slaves brought from Africa were brought to the Americas which was claimed to be found by Christopher Columbus himself. In conclusion, the Portuguese were weakened after the Dutch rose in the Indian Ocean trade route. Spain gained almost all of Latin America and a massive amount of silver.\nWhen Christopher Columbus tried to find a new trade route to Asia, he thought that he could travel around the world. Instead, he had found a New World. Vikings had briefly visited Vinland around 1000 A.D."}

It is usually sold quite green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is larger, thicker-skinned, and less aromatic than the key lime. The key lime is grown more often worldwide. The Persian lime is bigger than the key lime, and has fewer seeds. The plant is also hardier, and has no thorns on the bushes. The fruit also has a longer shelf life. \nPersian limes are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavour. Persian limes are sold primarily in six sizes, known as 110's, 150's, 175's, 200's, 230's and 250's. They are grown primarily in Florida in the U.S. The Persian lime became more important when key lime orchards were wiped out by a hurricane in 1926. Persian lime orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed and exported every year primarily from Mart\u00ednez de la Torre, Veracruz, Mexico, to the American, European and Asian markets. U.S. Persian lime imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen, Texas.\nReferences.\nss"}

The city contains al-Masjid al-Nabawi (\"the Prophet's Mosque\"), which is the burial place of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is the second-holiest city in Islam after Mecca.\nMedina was Muhammad's destination after his Hijrah from Mecca, and became the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire, first under Muhammad's leadership, and then under the first four Rashidun caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. It served as the power base of Islam in its first century where the early Muslim community developed. Medina is home to the three oldest mosques, namely the Quba Mosque, al-Masjid an-Nabawi, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn (\"the mosque of the two qiblas\"). Muslims believe that the chronologically final surahs of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad in Medina, and are called Medinan surahs in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.\nSimilar to Mecca, non-Muslims are forbidden from entering the sacred core of Medina or the center of the city.\nOverview.\nMedina currently has a population of more than 1,300,000 people (2006). The city was originally known as \"Yathrib\", but later its name was changed to Mad\u012bnat al-Nab\u012b (\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \ufe8d\ufedf\ufee8\ufe92\ufef2 \"city of the prophet\") or \"Al Mad\u012bnah al Munawwarah\" (\"the enlightened city\" or \"the radiant city\"). The short form \"Mad\u012bnah\" simply means \"city\". Madina is the second holiest city of Islam, after Mecca (Makkah).\nMedina's religious significance in Islam.\nMedina is very important to Muslims. This is because the Prophet Muhammad is buried in a mosque known as 'Masjid-e-Nabawi' or 'The Mosque of The Prophet'. The Mosque was built on a site next to Muhammad's home. Muslims believe that Prophets must be buried at the very same place that they die. Accordingly, Muhammad was buried in his house. The tomb later became part of the mosque when it was expanded by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I. The first mosque of Islam is also in Medina. It is known as \"Masjid Quba,\" (the Quba Mosque).\nLike Mecca, the city of Medina only permits Muslims to enter. The \"haram\" (area closed to non-Muslims) of Medina is much smaller than that of Mecca, though. Many facilities on the outskirts of Medina are open to non-Muslims. In Mecca the area closed to non-Muslims extends well beyond the limits of the built-up area. Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their annual pilgrimage. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina each year to visit the 'Tomb of Prophet' and to worship at mosques in a unified celebration. Muslims believe that praying once in the Mosque of the Prophet is equal to praying at least 1000 times in any other mosque."}

{"id": "60295", "revid": "8630", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60295", "title": "Citron", "text": "The citron (\"Citrus medica\") is a species of citrus fruit. It usually has a thick rind and small sections. Originally, the tree came from Southeast Asia. Today it is mainly grown in Sicily, Morocco, Crete, and Corsica, as well as Puerto Rico. The tree can grow to a size of about 3 metres. The fruit can grow to a size of about 25\u00a0cm in length, and about 4\u00a0kg in weight. The pulp of the fruit is hardly ever used. The rind is used. It is made into an additive for cooking. Jam can also be made from the rind. The rind is also used to make vegetable oil, which is used for perfumes.\nGenerally, it is eaten preserved or in bakery goods, such as fruitcakes. (The candied peel rather than the fruit is often used in cooking.) In some cultures, it is made into a fruity tea. Pliny the Elder states that in his time , the citron could only be grown in Media and Persia (\"HN\" xii.7). The Romans tried to transport it into the Roman Empire in tightly packed pots, but failed, according to Pliny. There is evidence, however, which shows it was cultivated in the Mediterranean during Pliny's lifetime. Zohary and Hopf believe this tree was first domesticated in India. They think that its wild forms, along with those of the mandarin and pomelo, were the original citrus species.\nThe citron has many names in different countries; one popular reference is \"Cedrat\", which is the French name for the fruit. Theophrastus referred to the citron as the Persian or Median Apple, and the fruit later came to be known as the Citrus Apple. Pliny calls the tree the Assyrian, or the Median, \"apple\" (the generic Greco-Roman name for globose fruits). Other citrus crops were not introduced to the Mediterranean basin until Islamic times.\nIn many languages other than English, a normal lemon is called a \"citron\" and a Lime is called a \"limon\". Although the East Asian citrus fruit \"yuzu\" (also called \"yuja\") is sometimes called a citron, it is actually a separate species, \"Citrus junos\". \nCultivation and uses.\nThe citron fruit is slow-growing. The citron tree is typically grown from cuttings that are two to four years old; the tree begins to bear fruit when it is around three years old. The fruit is oblong in shape, and sometimes as much as six inches in length. Its skin is thick, somewhat hard, fragrant, and covered with protuberances; the pulp is white and subacid. \nIn Pliny's time the fruit was never eaten (it began to be used in cooking by the early 2nd century), but its intense perfume was used, penetrating clothes to repel noxious insects (compare Citronella). \nIn Hebrew, the citron is known as the etrog (). It is one of the Four Species used during the holiday of Sukkot each fall. The role of the citron in that holiday was portrayed in the Israeli movie Ushpizin. Citrons that have been bred with lemon (in order to increase output per tree and make the tree less fragile) are not kosher for use as part of the Four Species.\nIn South Indian cuisine, especially Tamil cuisine, citron is widely used in pickles and preserves. In Tamil, the unripe fruit is referred to as 'narthangai', which is usually salted and dried to make a preserve. The tender leaves of the plant are often used in conjunction with chili powder and other spices to make a powder, called 'narthellai podi', literally translating to 'powder of citron leaves'. Both narthangai and narthellai podi are usually consumed with 'thayir sadam' (Curd Rice - Yogurt Rice).\nIn Korea, it is used to create a syrupy tea (called Yuja cha) where the slices of whole fruit are eaten with the sweet tea. The fruit is thinly sliced (peel, pith and pulp) and soaked or cooked in honey or sugar to create a chunky syrup. This syrupy candied fruit is mixed with hot water as a fragrant tea, where the fruit at the bottom of the cup is eaten as well. Often perserved in the syrup for the cold months, Yuja tea served as a source of fruit in winter. It is also popular in Taiwan, where it is known as \u67da\u5b50\u8336 (Youzi cha).\n[Note: The Korean Yuja is the same as the Japanese Yuzu \u67da\u5b50 and must be different from the citron being described in this article. The Japanese Yuzu = Citrus junos.]"}

He is most known today because he was Beethoven\u2019s teacher for a time.\nLife.\nFrom the age of seven, Albrechtsberger was a choirboy. He had lessons in organ and music theory. As an adult, he had several jobs in churches in small towns. He became Kapellmeister at St Stephen\u2019s Church, Vienna in 1793. This was the best job for a church musician in the empire.\nWriting music.\nAlbrechtsberger wrote hundreds of compositions. He wrote most of them before he got the job in Vienna. He wrote in a classical style. Albrechsberger enjoyed doing things with music which were not normally done. He would ask string players to tune their strings in different ways (called \u201cscordatura\u201d). He would also write slow movements with muted strings. As well as classical sonatas he wrote lots of fugues. Several people, including Mozart, thought of him as the greatest organist in the world.\nTeaching.\nAlbrechtsberger was a very important music teacher. Joseph Haydn thought he was the best teacher in Vienna. He was very interested in contrapuntal music of the Baroque period. He copied many fugues by Bach and other composers.\nWhen Beethoven was a young man, he had some composition lessons from Joseph Haydn. When Haydn was going to travel to England for several months, he asked Albrechtsberger to teach Beethoven while he was gone. These lessons took place from 1793 to 1795. A few years later, Albrechtsberger said about Beethoven that \u201che learned absolutely nothing and will never accomplish anything decent\u201d. Beethoven said that Albrechtsberger was a \u201cmusical pedant\u201d. However, Beethoven still studied Albrechtsberger\u2019s books on music theory. The string quartets which Beethoven wrote near the end of his life show the influence of Albrechtsberger."}

It is Beethoven's only opera. The German libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner based on a French story. The opera tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard called \"Fidelio\", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison.\n\"Fidelio\" is an example of a \u201crescue opera\u201d, a type of opera which was popular at the time. The hero (or heroine) has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover. It was written at the time of the French Revolution. At this time, ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone, and this led to wars all over Europe. The famous Prisoners\u2019 Chorus is a song for freedom, just like the last movement of his Ninth Symphony.\nBeethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it. The first time it was performed (in 1805) it was a three-act opera called \"Leonore\". There were a lot of French military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised. In 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture (now known as \"Overture: Leonore No. 3\"). But arguments between Beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances. Eight years later Beethoven revised his opera again. This time it was called \"Fidelio\", and it was a great success. It has remained a famous opera ever since.\nPlot.\nThe setting is a Spanish state prison, a few miles from Seville, in the late 1700s.\nAct I.\nJaquino is a prison guard. He wants to marry Marzelline, the daughter of Rocco who is the warden of the prison. But Marzelline has just fallen in love with someone she thinks is a man called Fidelio. Actually Fidelio is a woman who has dressed up as a man so that she can get into the prison where her husband Florestan is a prisoner (he has been arrested for political reasons). She is pretending to return Marzelline\u2019s love so that she can find a way of rescuing Florestan. Rocco says he is happy for Marzelline to marry Fidelio. Fidelio (Leonore) says she will help Rocco with his job of looking after the prisoners. Rocco says she can do this, but there is one prisoner she is not allowed to guard. He has been locked up alone for two years. Leonore thinks it may be her husband, but she is not sure.\nDon Pizarro, the military governor of the prison, hears that the prison is going to be looked at by inspectors who make sure that the prison is being properly managed. He knows that he should not have locked Florestan up, so decides to kill him before the inspection starts. He asks Rocco to dig the grave so that he can get rid of the body quickly. Rocco does not want to do this, but has to agree.\nLeonore lets the prisoners have a walk in the garden. Rocco tells Leonore that he must help him dig the grave. Rocco is very cross that the prisoners are walking in the garden, but Rocco says they should be allowed because it is the King\u2019s name-day. Rocco says they should be locked up again.\nAct II.\nFlorestan sits alone in his cell. In his mind he imagines an angel who looks like his wife who is telling him to come to Heaven.\nLeonore goes with Rocco to the prisoner. She is still not sure whether it is her husband. She gives him some bread. When Pizarro comes he gets ready to kill Florestan, but Leonore stands between them and tells Pizarro she will shoot him if he comes nearer. A trumpet is heard playing a fanfare because the Minister is arriving.\nOutside the prison the Minister says that all the prisoners are now free. He is horrified to find Florestan among the prisoners, because he is his friend. The crowd ask for Pizarro to be punished. Leonore frees her husband from his chains and the crowd say that she is a great heroine.\nThe Overtures.\nBeethoven made several changes to the opera at different times. This included writing four different overtures. They are called \"Leonore 1\", \"Leonore 2\", \"Leonore 3\" and \"Fidelio\". The overture \"Fidelio\" is the one that is normally heard now at the beginning of the opera. \"Leonore 2\" was the overture performed at the first performance in 1805. \"Leonore 3\", composed in 1806, is the most famous of the overtures. \"Leonore 1\" may have been written in 1805, or it may have been intended for a performance in 1807 in Prague which never took place\". Sometimes the \"Leonore 3\" overture is played during Act II between the two scenes. However, many people think it does not work dramatically there. It is usually heard today as a separate concert piece. The overture \"Fidelio\" was composed for performances of the opera in 1814."}

This is why it is known as the \u201cchoral\u201d symphony (\u201cchoral\u201d means: \u201cfor choir\u201d). It is a very long work, lasting more than an hour. This, too, was unusual.\nThis symphony has four movements. The first movement is in sonata form. The second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order: the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement. It is a theme and variations. The last movement sets the words of a poem by Friedrich Schiller, a famous poet who had only recently died. The poem was called \"Ode an die Freude\" (in English: \"Ode to Joy\"). The poem has a strong message to all mankind: it is about living in peace and harmony together. It was written at the time of the French Revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in Europe.\nThe main tune of the last movement (sung to the words: \u201cFreude, sch\u00f6ne G\u00f6tterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium\u201d) is one of the best known tunes in the world. Many children like to play it on instruments because the first part of the tune only uses five notes (it can be played on C, D, E, F, G). When the tune comes the first time in the symphony it is played by the cellos and double basses.\nThe \"Ode to Joy\" was adopted as Europe's \u201cNational anthem\u201d in 1972, with an official arrangement for orchestra written by Herbert von Karajan.\nBeethoven had been interested in Schiller\u2019s famous poem since he was young. In 1817 he started to write the first two movements of the symphony. In 1822 he decided to use Schiller\u2019s poem in the symphony. Most of the rest of the symphony was written in 1823 and he finished it in 1824. It was first performed in May of that year. Beethoven conducted the performance. The story is told that he wondered why the audience were not applauding when it had finished. They were applauding, but Beethoven was deaf so he could not hear. Someone made him turn round, and he saw that people were applauding enthusiastically."}

Its English name is simply said to be SPYC or PYC. It was started in 1978, and uses the money given by the Hong Kong government. There are 4 classes each for Forms 1 to 6 (as in 2019). The school icon is an eagle, which means courage and determination. Its location is at 9 Fung Shun Street, Wo Che Estate, Sha Tin District, Hong Kong.\nWhat the school does.\nThe school teaches its students for public examinations. The school motto is: Faith, Hope, Love\" (\u300c\u4fe1\u3001\u671b\u3001\u611b\u300d). The school teaches the students other things to gain higher qualities of moral (\u5fb7), intelligent (\u667a), physical (\u9ad4), social (\u7fa4), art (\u7f8e) and heart (\u9748).\nSchool history.\nThe father of the school is Rev Henry Noyes. In 1879, he built a school in Guangzhou, teaching Mathematics and Science. Later he built more schools in Taishan, Jiangmen and Hong Kong.\nIn 1978, someone built the 5th school which is Shatin Pui Ying College. Mr Wong Wai Wah was the Principal. In the first year, the school worked on the campus of Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School at Lek Yuen Estate. In September 1979, the school could move into Wo Che Estate. The school library was opened since September 1982.\nIn order to make it possible for all the Form 3 students to study as Form 4 in the school, the school changed the class structure. The Student Union was set up in September 1995 and Parent-Teacher Association in 1996. In 1996, Principal Wong gave up working and the Vice Principal Ms Yau Oi Yuen started doing his work. The elite class system was deleted in September, 1996.\nThe library system was changed to use computer since September 2001. The new wing building of the school has been finished since July 2005. In the new wing, there are classrooms for higher forms classes, a new library, some special rooms and computer rooms.\nTeaching languages.\nEnglish.\nExchange students from Italy and Germany help the students learn English. The school has many English activities such as English Tutorial Class, English Drama Competition, Form 1 Bridging Programme, Lyrics-writing Course, English Immersion Speech Competition, Interviewing Tourists, English Phonetics Class, English Enhancement Course, Summer English Class, Overseas Immersion Course, Summer English Camp for senior form students, Summer English Day Camp for junior form students, Intra-school and Inter-school English Debate Competitions and English Musicals.\nChinese.\nThe Chinese Language teachers write their own teaching units for the students.

All of the Form 3 students can study as Form 4 in the school. Students have good results in public examinations. The average passing percentage for the HKCEE and HKALE is higher than 90%. The best student in HKCEE got 8As in 2004.\nAll Form 6 students in the school are from the Form 5 in the same school, except the exchange students from other countries. Most of the Form 7 students can study in the universities these years.\nAccording to the government, the school teaches Chinese language, English language and Mathematics very well from 2000 to 2006.\nThe school gives the good students some awards, such as scholarships, Academic Awards, Flying Eagle Awards and Improvement Awards. The school gives money to some students to take part in some inter-school competition and courses in some universities such as The University of Hong Kong, The Chinese University of Hong Kong and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. There are some tutorial classes to improve junior students' skills in both English and Chinese languages and also Mathematics.\nSpecial things.\nReading activities.\nReading Time is designed to help students having a good reading habit. Reading Days are held by the school library for all students to read or to take part in activities related to reading.\nInformation technology.\nThere are many computer subjects in the school, such as Information Technology (IT) for Forms 1 to 3, Computer and Information Technology (CIT) for Forms 4 and 5, and Computer Applications (CA) for Forms 6 and 7.\nTeaching art.\nThe school has organised 3 musicals, The Comeback Kid, Soul for Sale and The Last Move. The songs inside are written by the students and past students. Every Form 1 student has to play at least 1 musical instrument. The Photography Club and the Audio-Visual Group teaches students many skills, such as film editing, image recording, lighting, backdrop setting and sound engineering.\nStudy about the world.\nThe school invites some guest speakers to the school to give speeches. Students can know more about the political, social and economic issues in Hong Kong and around the world. The school lets the students to join some extracurricular activities such as \"The Youth Summit\", \"Dinner with Outstanding Citizens\" and \"Hong Kong International Model United Nations\". The school lets the students to join mainland and overseas cultural tours.\nStudent leaders.\nThe students can take leadership-training courses and extracurricular activities, such as activities such as \u201cYouth Leaders Auditorium 2005\u201d, \u201cThe 6th Basic Certificate Course for Student Leaders\u201d, \u201cOutstanding Leadership Development Programme\u201d and \u201cYouth Think Tank Training Project\u201d. There are Free Talks so that students can have better training in giving speeches.\nFlying Eagle Award.\nThis award is only for the students who have good learning habit, good examination results, good self-discipline, good responsibility, community skills and studies in school activities. There are 4 phases in this award. Students can get a Bronze Eagle Badge in Phase 1, a Silver Eagle Badge in Phase 2, a Gold Eagle Badge in Phase 3 and a cup in Phase 4.\nStudy about God.\nThere are many activities to teach students about the Christian principles, such as Gospel Week, Gospel Camp Evangelical Team, Evangelical Broadcast, Bible Study Groups and Christian Fellowship.\nSchool life.\nSchool songs.\nThere is a school song with Chinese lyrics. Its melody is the same as the song O Christmas Tree and there are two paragraphs. There is also a school hymn with English lyrics. There are three paragraphs in this school hymn.\nSchool uniform.\nAll boys in the school wear white shirts and green trousers, and all girls wear white dresses with green drawstrings as summer uniform. The boys wear grey trousers and the girls wear grey dresses with white socks as winter uniform. Both boys and girls wear green ties when wearing winter uniform.\nWhen students have physical education lessons, they wear PE uniform. From 2000, students can wear PE uniform to school without changing at school. From 2001, the PE uniform has been changed into a new format that is grey and blue in colour. The PE T-shirts have 3 different colours, namely black, blue and red, with respect to the students\u2019 house.\nClasses.\nThe class names are combined with one number and one English character, such as \u201c6B\u201d. After the New Secondary School program was out, the number of classes and students per class was changed. There are about 30 students in each class from Form 1 to Form 6. 1A and 1B are remedial classes whereas 1C to 1E perform better in exams. The classes are mixed when students go into Form 2 or Form 3.\nAll Form 3 students have to choose their subjects after finishing their year. After finishing 2 and a half years of High Form study, students have to join the public exam, DSE (usually in April).\nHouses.\nEach Form forms a House, with its own chairman and committee members elected by the students in the own Form. Each House has its own colour such as black, blue or red, just like the students\u2019 PE uniform. The forms from the same colours form some cheering teams during the sports days.\nSports days and swimming gala.\nThere are 2 sports days every year. The sports days take places on the Yuen Wo Road Sports Ground. Besides the various types of sports competitions, there are competitions among the cheering teams. The swimming gala is held every year with the Pui Ying Secondary School. It takes place on the Hong Kong Island or Sha Tin District alternatively every two years.\nExternal competitions.\nStudents in the school take parts in many external competitions in many fields such as music, sports, debates, writings, mathematics and other academic competitions. One of the most notable competitions is the Hang Lung Mathematics Award.

It is better than chance, but does not always work. A person develops a heuristic by using intelligence, experience, and common sense. Trial and error is the simplest heuristic, but one of the weakest. Rule of thumb and 'educated guesses' are other names for simple heuristics. Since a heuristic is not certain to get a result, there are always exceptions.\nSometimes heuristics are rather vague: 'look before you leap' is a guide to behaviour, but 'think about the consequences' is a bit clearer. Sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages. When doctors examines a patient, they go through a whole set of tests and observations. They may not find out what is wrong, but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding. This is called a diagnosis.\nIn computer science, a 'heuristic' is a kind of algorithm. Algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem. A heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions, but there is no guarantee or proof that the solutions are correct. The time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration.\nBackground.\nHeuristics is the art of finding an adequate solution to a problem, using limited knowledge and little time. More formally, heuristics are based on experience; they can speed up the search for a solution using simple rules. A complete search may take too long, or may be too difficult to do.\nIn more precise terms, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human beings and machines.\nHeuristics can be used in some fields of science, but not in others: For economics, a solution that is one percent off is often acceptable; a telescope that has an error of one degree is probably unusable if aimed at a far-away object. The same telescope pointed to the window across the street will probably tolerate this error; missing by one degree will not have a big impact on a short distance.\nHeuristics can be used to estimate an answer which is then made more clear by performing an exact solution at a very small scale, perhaps to save time, money or labor on a project - for example a heuristic guess as to how much weight a bridge is expected to carry can be used to determine whether the bridge should be made of wood, stone or steel, and appropriate quantities of the needed material can be purchased while the exact design of the bridge is being completed.\nHowever, the use of heuristics in certain very technical fields may be damaging computer science is one example. Programming a computer to perform more or less the desired actions may result in severe glitches. Therefore, computer tasks generally must be fairly exact. However, there are certain areas in which computers can calculate heuristic solutions safely for example Google's search technology relies heavily on heuristics, producing \"near-miss\" matches to a search query when an exact match cannot be found. This enables a user to correct for any mistakes the search produces. Example: Searching for the name \"Peter Smith\" and unable to find that exact name, the search engine heuristically matches \"Pete Smith\" instead, and the person using the search engine must decide whether Pete and Peter are the same person.\nExamples.\nPolya.\nHere are some other commonly used heuristics, from Polya's 1945 book, \"How to Solve It\":\nPacking problem.\nOne example where heuristics are useful is a kind of packing problem. The problem consists of packing a number of items. There are rules that need to be respected. For example, each item has a value and a weight. The problem now is to get the most valuable items, with the least weight possible. Another instance is fitting a number of differently-sized items into a confined space, like the trunk of a car.\nTo get the perfect solution to the problem, all possibilities must be tried. This is often not a good option, as trying them takes a long time, and on average, half the possibilities must be tried until a solution is found. So what most people will do is to start with the biggest item, fit it in, and then try to arrange the other items around it. This will give a good solution, most of the time. There are cases however, where such a solution is very bad and another technique must be used.\nTherefore, this is a heuristic solution."}

This however, is not sufficient. Many mathematicians prefer the definition of a Mersenne number where exponent \"n\" has to be a prime number.\nFor example, \"31 = 25 \u2212 1\", and 5 is a prime number, so 31 is a Mersenne number; and 31 is also a Mersenne prime because it is a prime number. But the Mersenne number \"2047 = 211 \u2212 1\" is not a prime because it is divisible by 89 and 23. And \"24 \u2212 1 = 15\" can be shown to be composite because 4 is not prime.\nThroughout modern times, the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime. Most sources restrict the term \"Mersenne number\" to where \"n\" is prime, as all Mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below.\nMersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers, which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Historically, the study of Mersenne primes was motivated by this connection; in the 4th century BC Euclid demonstrated that if \"M\" is a Mersenne prime then \"M\"(\"M\"+1)/2 is a perfect number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form. No odd perfect numbers are known, and it is suspected that none exist (If it exist, it would have to be greater than 101500).\nIt is currently unknown if there is an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Most mathematicians who have studied the question think there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Carl Pomerance, Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr. and Hendrik Lenstra developed a formula which they think should say about how many Mersenne primes there are under a given number.\nThe binary representation of 2\"n\" - 1 is \"n\" repetitions of the digit 1.\nFor example, 2\"5\" - 1 = 11111 in binary.\nThe first four Mersenne primes were known by the Ancient Greeks. They are 3, 7, 31 and 127. The next, 8191, was discovered in 1456. Some people like trying to find big primes. Since there are tricks and algorithms to finding Mersenne primes quickly, the largest known primes are also Mersenne primes.\nAs of December 21, 2018, 51 Mersenne primes have been found. The largest known prime is a Mersenne prime, formula_1."}

{"id": "60367", "revid": "1070632", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60367", "title": "Insolation", "text": "Insolation is derived from the words \"incoming solar radiation\". Insolation is specifically applied to radiation which is arriving at earth\u2019s atmosphere first and then earth's surface. The heat is derived from solar energy, normally called solar radiation. Insolation is the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface. It is measured by the amount of solar energy received per square centimetre per minute. Similarly, solar energy received by the earth is called insolation. It is the amount of incoming solar radiation that is received over a unit area of the earth\u2019s surface. Solar energy received over the planet\u2019s surface varies according to season, latitude, transparency of the atmosphere, and aspect or ground slope.\nInsolation affects temperature. The more the insolation, the higher the temperature.\nIn any given day, the strongest insolation is received at noon.\nFactors influencing insolation.\nThe amount of insolation received on the earth\u2019s surface is not uniform everywhere. It varies according to the place and time. When the tropical regions receive maximum annual insolation, it gradually decreases towards the poles. Insolation happens more in summers and less in winters. The major factors which influence the amount of insolation received are:\nSolar Constant.\nAt the top of the earth\u2019s atmosphere received insolation is expressed as the solar constant. It receives at the top of the atmospheric surface (thermopause) on a perpendicular plane to the solar beam. The average insolation received at the thermopause i.e.1368Wm2(Watt per squaremetre)energy(solar constant) is in the form of short wave. Thus, it is termed as solar constant for that mean distance from the sun. These solar constant is varying over 1 Wm2 by periodic disturbances and explosions in the solar surface basically related to sun spot. Sun spots are dark and cooler areas visible on the sun\u2019s surface.The recent researches have shown that more and more energy is released when the sunpots are in large number.The number of sunspots also increases or decreases on a regular basis, creating a cycle of 11 years.\nThe angle of incidence.\nSince the earth is a geoid resembling a sphere, the sun\u2019s rays strike the surface at different angles at different places. This depends on the latitude of the place.The higher the latitude, the less is the angle they make with the surface of the earth.\nThe area covered by the vertical rays is always less than the slant rays. If more area is covered, the energy gets distributed and the net energy received per unit area decreases. Moreover, the sun\u2019s rays with small angle traverse more of the atmosphere than rays striking at a large angle.\nDuration of The Day.\nThe length of the day determines the duration of sunlight which affects the amount of solar radiation received by the earth\u2019s surface. The longer period of sunshine, greater the quantity of solar radiation will be received by a portion of earth.For example, at the equator the length of days and nights is 12 hours in all the months but the tropics of Arctic and Antarctic sunshine duration varies between 0 and 24. On the autumn and springe quinoxes (September 23and March 21 respectively),the sun is overhead at the equatorat noon.The night and day all over the earth are equal on these days and maximum amount of insolation is received at the equator, and the amount of insolation decreasing towards the poles.It is caused by vertical sunshine at equator but with increasing latitudes, the rays become more and more slanting. Therefore, poleward, the received energy keeps on declining.\nEarth's Distance from Sun.\nThe earth is revolving around the sun in an elliptical orbit, resulting continuous change in the distance between sun and the earth on annual basis. It leads to seasonal variation in solar energy received by the earth.The mean distance between the earth and sun is about 149,600,000 kilometers(92,900,000 miles).When earth position is farthest(152 million km) from sun is known as \u2018aphelion\u2019 on July 4. It is perihelion(147 million km)occurs on January 3 each year which is the closest distance. During aphelion the northern hemisphere is facing the sun and therefore receives energy about 7 percent less than the perihelion (southern hemisphere).\nTransparency of the Atmosphere.\nAtmosphere is not transparent for all the radiation coming from the sun because of different composition and layers. It is also one of the controlling factors of insolation to reach earth surface. The atmosphere is composed of gases, water vapour and particulate matters.The atmosphere is a mixture of gases,such as nitrogen(N), oxygen (O2), Argon, carbon dioxide, Neon (Ne), Helium (He), Methane (CH4), Krypton (Kr), Ozone (O3), Nitrous oxide (N2O), Hydrogen (H) and Xenon (Xe). The atmosphere also contains water vapour, water in the gaseous state.\nThe longer the duration of daylight, the more the insolation received per day."}

He was the leader of the \"Bolivarian Revolution\" and promoted his vision of democratic socialism, Latin American integration, and anti-imperialism. Ch\u00e1vez was also an ardent critic of neoliberal globalization and U.S. foreign policy.\nCareer.\nCh\u00e1vez was a career military officer. He founded the left-wing Fifth Republic Movement after a failed coup d'\u00e9tat against former President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez. Ch\u00e1vez was elected to serve as president in 1998. This was mainly because he promised to help the poor majority of Venezuelan people. He was re-elected in 2000, and 2006.\nHe started a movement called Bolivarian Missions. Its goal is to fight disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, poverty, and other social problems. Abroad, Ch\u00e1vez is known for supporting alternative models of economic development. He also spoke in favor of a collaboration of poor nations, especially those in Latin America. On September 20, 2006, Ch\u00e1vez made a speech to the UN General Assembly. Ch\u00e1vez said that U.S. President George W. Bush is \"The devil came here yesterday, and it smells of sulfur still today\".\nCh\u00e1vez's reforms have caused controversy, both inside Venezuela, and outside the country. Some people criticized the reforms, others supported them. Those people who support the reforms say that he has given more power to the poor, and that he has stimulated economic growth. Those who argue against the reforms say that he is an autocrat who has mismanaged the economy.\nSome governments, especially the government of the United States saw Ch\u00e1vez as a threat to global oil prices, as well as to regional stability. Others sympathize with his ideology or welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements.\nAwards.\nIn 2005 and 2006 he was named one of \"Time\" magazine's 100 most influential people. Chavez has received many prizes: He has received honorary doctorates from the University of Beijing, the university of Rio de Janeiro, the university of Santo Domingo, and Kyung Hee University in South Korea.\nBelief.\nCh\u00e1vez said he was a Roman Catholic. Much like his predecessor Simon B\u00f3livar, Ch\u00e1vez tolerated elements of belief systems,popular in Venezuela, such as the Mar\u00eda Lionza cult and Saner\u00eda. These movements mix Roman Catholic belief with other elements, such as those of Voodoo and Shamanism. Chavez also put emphasis on the social ideas of the Catholic church, and remained in the background when it came to discussing controversial ideas. His ideas caused controversy with some clerics of the Catholic church, and some evangelical movements. While he was na pilgrimage, cardinal Rosalio Lara said that those that did not have the same ideas as the people in power were persecuted, and that Chavez' way of running the country was undemocratic.\nHealth.\nHe had an operation on his pelvis to remove his colorectal cancer. On January 2013, his cancer worsened and was put on life support. Ch\u00e1vez put his daughter in charge whether he should live or die. He was treated for the disease in Cuba and in Venezuela. On February 27, 2013 rumors said that his daughter stopped the life support on February 23. Later on February 28, the Vice President said that Ch\u00e1vez was fighting for his life. Ch\u00e1vez died of colorectal cancer on March 5, 2013.\nDeath.\nOn March 5, 2013 Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced on state television that Ch\u00e1vez died in Caracas, Venezuela at 16:25 VET (2055 UTC). The cause of his death was a heart attack caused by colorectal cancer and respiratory failure. He battled cancer since June 2011. He is survived by his three daughters and one son. Leaders from the world shared reactions about Ch\u00e1vez's death."}

Most of the material is calcite (a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3) and dolomite. It is often used for sculpture, as a building material, and for many other purposes.\nThe word 'marble' is also used for other stones that can be polished well and for ball shaped objects used for child games. \n'Faux marble' is a wall painting technique that imitates the color patterns of real marble (not to be confused with paper marbling). Marble dust can be combined with cement or synthetic resins to make \"reconstituted\" or \"cultured marble\".\nMarble has been used in construction for thousands of years. It was widely used by Greek and Roman sculptors and architects. Places named after the stone include Marble Arch, London; the Sea of Marmara; India's Marble Rocks; and the towns of Marble, Minnesota; Marble, Colorado; and Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York. The Elgin Marbles are marble sculptures from the Parthenon that are on display in the British Museum. They were brought to Britain by the Earl of Elgin.\nConstruction marble.\nIn the construction trade, the term \"marble\" is used for any massive, crystalline calcitic rock (and some non-calcitic rocks) useful as building stone. \nExamples.\nPurbeck marble is a fossiliferous limestone found in the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula in south-east Dorset, England. It has been quarried since at least Roman times as a decorative building stone. The industry is no longer active.\nTennessee marble is really a massive, highly fossiliferous gray to pink to maroon Ordovician dolostone, known as the Holston Formation by geologists. \"Tennessee marble\" is not true marble. Its crystalline nature gives it a resemblance to marble, especially when polished. \nCarrara marble is a genuine marble. It is white or blue-grey and of high quality, popular for use in sculpture and building decor. It is quarried at the city of Carrara in the Lunigiana, the northernmost tip of modern-day Tuscany, Italy. The illustration shows the \"Piet\u00e0\", which is a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture by Michelangelo. It is in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, and is the only piece Michelangelo ever signed.\nIndustrial use of marble.\nColorless marbles are a very pure source of calcium carbonate, which is used in a wide variety of industries. Finely ground marble powder is a component in paint, toothpaste, and plastics; calcium carbonate can also be reduced under high heat to calcium oxide (also known as \"quicklime\"), which has many uses including being a primary component of most cements."}

{"id": "60431", "revid": "6815997", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60431", "title": "Categorical imperative", "text": "The categorical imperative is an idea that the philosopher Immanuel Kant had about ethics. Kant said that an \"imperative\" is something that a person must do. For example: if a person wants to stop being thirsty, it is \"imperative\" that they have a drink. Kant said an imperative is \"categorical,\" when it is true at all times, and in all situations. \nThe example of a thirsty person Kant named the Hypothetical Imperative. Kant used the \"hypothetical\" imperative to explain his ideas about the ethics of a \"categorical \"imperative. For example, it is not usually a moral choice when a person decides to drink water, no matter why they are drinking the water. If a person is very thirsty, then it is a hypothetical imperative that they drink the water. \nInstead of the hypothetical imperative, Kant said that the moral choices are governed by a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative is something that a person must do, no matter what the circumstances. It is imperative to an ethical person that they make choices based on the categorical imperative. Another way of saying that, is that an ethical person follows a \"universal law\" regardless of their situation. \nKant explained his ideas about following the categorical imperative by introducing one more idea he called a \"maxim.\" A maxim is another way of saying what we want to do and why we want to do it in one sentence. We can learn ethical maxims by applying the test of the categorical imperative. And he said we can live ethical lives if we use these maxims whenever we make decisions. \nThe categorical imperative, hypothetical imperative, and the maxim can all be seen in the example of the thirsty man. A man locked alone in a room for one night, and he brought nothing with him except a bottle of water. The man has had nothing to drink all day and is very thirsty. We can call this man, \"Thirsty Man.\" \nA hypothetical imperative might be that \"a thirsty man must drink water if he wants to stop being thirsty.\" If Thirsty Man lived by a maxim based on this hypothetical imperative, it might be \"If I can, I will drink water whenever I am thirsty.\" In this example, Thirsty Man is not making any obvious moral choice. Some philosophers would say that the Thirsty Man's maxim is a reasonable one. Based on Thirsty Man's maxim, he will soon drink the water. A few minutes later a second man is brought into the room. Both men are told that they will be in the room all night, and that no one else will be back to see them until morning. \nThirsty Man has not yet opened the water bottle. The new man has not had anything to drink for many days. The second man is clearly dying of dehydration. If he is not given water soon he will die. We can call this second man, \"Dying Man.\" Thirsty Man now has a decision to make, will he share the water or drink it himself? Thirsty Man does not live by the maxim of \"I will drink water when I am thirsty,\" because that maxim fails the test of being universally fulfilling the \"categorical imperative.\" \nThirsty Man believes that the categorical imperative is the Golden Rule. To be an ethical person, Thirsty Man believes he must at all times treat others the way he would want them to treat him. From the categorical imperative of the Golden Rule, Thirsty Man has adopted a maxim of \"I will give anything I can to anyone I meet, if that person needs what I have much more than I need it.\" Thirsty Man prepares to decide if he will drink the water that he wants to drink, or if he will give it to Dying Man. Thirsty Man tests both choices by comparing them to his maxim. He sees that it is \"imperative \" that he give the water to Dying Man. Thirsty Man gives the water to Dying Man. Dying Man drinks nearly the entire bottle, but then he chokes on the last sip. There is nothing Thirsty Man can do to stop the choking, and Dying Man dies. There are many philosophies of ethics, and many philosophers who have very different opinions. Some philosophers might say that it would have been ethical if Thirsty Man had kept the bottle for himself to drink. It was his bottle to begin with and he could do whatever he wanted with it. Other philosophers might say that Thirsty Man was ethically wrong to give the bottle to Dying Man because the water ended up choking the Dying Man to death. \nKant's idea of the categorical imperative would say that Thirsty Man made the right choice, for the right reasons, and he made those ethical decisions in a logical way. \nAn important part of Kant's idea is that the morality of a choice is based on why we make the choice (intention), and not based on what happens after we make it (consequence). Another important part of Kant's idea is that these ethical decisions are not rules or laws handed down to us (universal law or objectively true ethical statement). Kant thought that ethical decisions needed to be based in logic and reason (correct reasoning or deductive reasoning). \nKant elaborated on these ideas by saying that we should treat other persons as persons and not as tools who can help us in some way. He said we should do this based on the ethical duty that all persons have to each other, an ethical duty which could be called a universal law. Kant's ideas about this universal law and the categorical imperative are important basic components of the philosophy of Absolutism. "}

It is the first stage in cellular respiration. It allows both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Glycolysis releases only a small amount of energy. The word \"glycosis\" comes from the Greek words \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cd\u03c2 (meaning \"sweet\") and \u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (meaning \"rupture\").\nGlycolysis is thought to be the archetype of a universal metabolic pathway. It occurs, with variations, in almost all organisms, both aerobic and anaerobic. The wide occurrence of glycolysis shows that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways.\nGlycolysis has ten intermediate compounds, catalysed by ten different enzymes. Only the broad outline is described here.\nProcess.\nPreparatory phase.\nThe first half of glycolysis is the preparatory phase. It starts off by adding a phosphate group to glucose (Glucose 6-phosphate). Next, the Glucose 6-phosphate is converted into Fructose 6-phosphate. Another phosphate group is added turning it into fructose -1,6- biphosphate. The fructose -1,6-biphosphate is then split in two, one part turning into G3P (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The dihydroxyacetone phosphate is converted into G3P, leaving us with the two G3P triose sugar molecules used in the Pay-off phase.\nPay-off phase.\nThe second half of glycolysis is known as the 'pay-off phase', by the net gain of the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADH. Since glucose leads to two triose () sugars in the preparatory phase, each reaction in the pay-off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule. This yields 2 NADH molecules and 4 ATP molecules, leading to a net gain of 2 NADH molecules and 2 ATP molecules from the glycolytic pathway per glucose molecule.\nSummary: 2ATP \u2192 4ATP + 2(NADH + H+) + 2 pyruvate (net production of 2ATP)\nAerobic respiration.\nCells performing aerobic respiration (respiration using oxygen) synthesize much more ATP, but not as part of glycolysis. These further reactions use the pyruvate from glycolysis. \nEukaryote aerobic respiration produces about 30 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule.\nGlycolysis, through anaerobic respiration, is the main energy source in many cells."}

The use of archetypes to analyze personality was advanced by Carl Jung early in the 20th century. The value in using archetypal characters in fiction derives from the fact that a large group of people are able to unconsciously recognize the archetype, and thus the motivations, behind the character's behavior.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"archetype\" appeared in European texts as early as 1545. It derives from the Latin noun \"archetypum\" via the Greek noun \"arkhetypon\" and adjective \"arkhetypos\", meaning \"first-moulded\".

They are best for using old software and games on newer computers. They can be hardware that you add to the computer, or software that you use on it. Some types of emulators require newer computers that have the right system requirements. For example, you need a processor that is fast enough to meet the demands of the emulator. Memory (both RAM and hard drive space) may be another factor to help it run smoothly and more accurately. With the more advanced emulators, if your computer is too old, the emulator or even the operating system may crash.\nTypes of emulators.\nThe simplest type of emulator is called an interpreter, and it runs the foreign program one step at a time. This is the slowest type of emulator but it is easy to debug and port to new platforms. Another type is called the dynamic recompiler, and it takes foreign code a block at a time and recompiles (converts) it into native code. Foreign code that has already been converted is kept, so if the foreign program uses that code again, the emulator does not have to recompile it again. This type of emulator is much faster than the interpreter. Another type is the virtualizer, which only makes slight modifications to the foreign code, and runs it directly on the host processor. The virtualizer requires that the guest (foreign) and host systems use the same type of CPU."}

His parents were of the working-class. The family was Roman Catholic. When he was eighteen, he had to go to war. The Army sent him the front lines of World War I. He was wounded there, by stray shell fragments. After the war, he changed his last name to \"Remarque\". This had been the family-name until his grandfather's time. He worked at a number of different jobs. He also took the jobs of librarian, businessman, teacher, journalist and editor, at some time.\nIn 1929, Remarque published his most famous work, \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (\"Im Westen nichts Neues\") under the name \"Erich Maria Remarque\". He Changed his middle name to honour his mother. The novel described the utter cruelty of the war from the perspective of a twenty-year-old soldier. A number of similar works followed; in simple, emotive language they realistically described wartime and the postwar years. An opposite view is found in \"Storm of Steel\" (\"In Stahlgewittern\") by Ernst J\u00fcnger.\nIn 1933, the Nazis banned and burned Remarque's works. They made propaganda materials. In the materials, they said that he was a descendant of French Jews and that his real last name was Kramer, his original name spelled backwards. This is still listed in some biographies despite the complete lack of proof. He had been living in Switzerland since 1931, and in 1939 he emigrated to the United States of America with his first wife, Ilsa Jeanne Zamboui, whom he married and divorced twice, and they became naturalized citizens of the United States in 1947. In 1948 he went to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of his life. He married the Hollywood actress Paulette Goddard in 1958. He was married to her until his death in 1970, at age 72. He is buried in the Ronco cemetery in Ronco, Ticino, Switzerland. Goddard is also buried there Goddard left $20m to New York University to fund an institute for European study which is named after Remarque.\nWork.\nHis books have been translated into at least 58 languages."}

In 2012, Socialist Party's candidate Fran\u00e7ois Hollande won the presidential election.\nHistory.\nFrench socialism until 1969.\nAfter the failure of the Paris commune (1871), French socialism was figuratively beheaded. Its leaders were killed or exiled. France's first socialist party, the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France (\"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des travailleurs socialistes de France\" or FTSF), was founded in 1879. \nIn 1899, the participation of Millerand in Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau's cabinet caused a debate about socialist participation in a \"bourgeois government\". Three years later, Jaur\u00e8s, Allemane and the possibilists founded the French Socialist Party while Guesde and Vaillant formed the Socialist Party of France. Then, in 1905, during the Globe Congress, the two groups merged in the French Section of the Workers International (\"Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale ouvri\u00e8re\" or SFIO). Jaur\u00e8s became the party leader.\nThe French socialists were strongly pacifist, but following the assassination of Jaur\u00e8s in 1914 they were unable to resist the wave of militarism which followed the outbreak of World War I.\nThe Socialists suffered a severe split over participation in the wartime government of national unity. In 1919 the anti-war socialists were heavily defeated in elections. In 1920, during the Tours Congress, the majority and left wing of the party broke away and formed the French Section of the Communist International (\"Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale Communiste\" or SFIC). This party joined the Third International, that was founded by Lenin. The right wing, led by L\u00e9on Blum, kept the \"old house\" and remained in the SFIO. \nIn 1934, the Communists changed their line, and the three parties came together in the Popular Front, which won the 1936 elections and brought Blum to power as France's first Socialist Prime Minister. \nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, the SFIO had a coalition with a powerful Communist Party (which became the main left-wing party) and the Christian Democratic MRP. This alliance did not survive the Cold War. Blum proposed the construction of a Third Force with the center-left and the center-right, against the Gaullists and the Communists. However, his candidate to lead of the SFIO, Daniel Mayer, was defeated by Guy Mollet.\nMollet was supported by the left wing of the party. Paradoxically, he spoke a Marxist language without questioning the alliance with the center and the center-right. He was Prime Minister at the head of a minority government in 1956. The SFIO returned to opposition in 1959. \nThe SFIO did not nominate a candidate for the 1965 election. Consequently, it supported the candidacy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, a former minister of the Fourth Republic who had been a conservative, then an independent of the left. He was resolutely anti-Gaullist. He obtained an honourable result and faced De Gaulle in an unexpected second ballot. He thus appeared as the leader of the non-Communist left.\nIn order to exist between the Communist Party, leading the left, and the Gaullist Party, leading the country, the SFIO, Radicals, and left wing republican groups created the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left under Mitterrand's leadership.\nThe foundation of the PS and the \"Union of Left\" (1969\u20131981).\nIn 1969 the SFIO was replaced by the Socialist Party (\"Parti socialiste\" or PS). It was joined by pro-Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France clubs (Union of Clubs for the Renewal of the Left led by Alain Savary) and left-wing republican groups (Union of Socialist Groups ad Clubs of Jean Poperen). During the Issy-les-Moulineaux Congress, Alain Savary was elected First Secretary with the support of his predecessor Guy Mollet. He proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists.\nTwo years later, pro-Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand clubs (Convention of the Republican institutions), joined the party. Mitterrand defeated the Savary-Mollet duo by proposing an electoral programme with the Communists. \nMitterrand's presidency and the practice of power (1981\u20131995).\nIn 1981 Mitterrand defeated the neoliberal Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, to become the first socialist elected President of France by universal suffrage. \nThe PS lost the majority in the French National Assembly in 1986, forcing Mitterrand to \"cohabit\" with the conservative government of Jacques Chirac. Nevertheless, Mitterrand was re-elected President in 1988 with a moderate programme entitled \"united France\". He proposed neither nationalisations nor privatisations. He chose as Prime Minister the most popular and moderate of the Socialist politicians, Michel Rocard. His cabinet included 4 center-right ministers but it was supported by only a plurality in the National Assembly elected in June 1988. \nDuring his second term, Mitterrand focused on foreign policy and European construction.\nJospin and the \"Plural Left\" (1995\u20132002).\nIn opposition, the PS reconstructed a coalition with the other left-wing forces: the PCF, the Greens, the Left Radical Party and the MDC. This \"Plural Left\" (\"Gauche plurielle\") gained the 1997 legislative election and Jospin became Prime Minister of the third \"cohabitation\".\nHis policy was broadly progressive but had little to do with socialism as traditionally understood. The Aubry laws reduced the working time to 35 hours a week. A universal medical cover was instituted. However, the policy of privatization was pursued. \nOn April 21, 2002 Jospin was eliminated at the first round of the presidential election. \nAfter the 2002 shock.\nIn the 2004 regional elections, the Socialists had a major comeback. In coalition with the former \"Plural Left\", they gained power in 20 of the 22 metropolitan regions (all except Alsace and Corsica) and in the four overseas regions. In fact, it benefited from a \"sanction-vote\" against the right. \nOn 1 December 2004, 59% of the members of the Socialist Party decided to approve the proposed European Constitution. However, several well-known members of the Party, including Laurent Fabius, and left-wingers Henri Emmanuelli and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, asked the voters to vote \"no\" in the 29 May 2005 French referendum on the European Constitution, at which the proposed Constitution was rejected. \n2007 presidential elections.\nFor the 2007 presidential election, many potential candidates appeared: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Laurent Fabius (who has joined the left-wing of the party), Dominique Strauss-Kahn (who claimed he represented \"social-democracy\"), Jack Lang, Martine Aubry and S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, who was favourite according to the polls. \nOn 16 November 2006, the members of the Socialist Party chose S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal to be their candidate with a majority of 60%. Her challengers, Strauss-Kahn and Fabius, obtained 21% and 19% respectively.\nAfter obtaining 25% of the vote in the first round of France's presidential elections S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal qualified for the second round of voting but lost to Nicolas Sarkozy on May 6, 2007. \nLeadership.\nFirst secretaries from 1969:"}

All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?\u201d Raskolnikov, the anti-hero of Dostoevsky\u2019s novel \"Crime and Punishment\", puts this philosophy into action when he kills an elderly pawnbroker and her sister, later rationalizing this act to himself with the words, \u201c...it wasn\u2019t a human being I killed, it was a principle!\u201d\nOn Hermann Hesse\u00b4s \"Der Steppenwolf\" we can also find a very clear picture of anomie. The protagonist affirms that the men of the Dark Ages did not suffer more than those of the Classical Antiquity, and vice-versa. It is rather those who live between two times, those who do not know what to follow, that suffer the most.

The season officially started on June 1, 1983, and ended on November 30. The seaon had only a total of 4 named storms, which was less than half of the average number of storms in a season. In addition, it was the least active season since ACE recording began in 1950.\nThe most strongest and deadliest storm of the season was Hurricane Alicia, which hit Texas causing great destruction and killing 21 people directly. The damages it brought totaled up to be $2 billion.\nStorms.\nTropical Depression One.\nThis was a small depression that affected the Lesser Antilles, but did not cause much damage.\nHurricane Alicia.\nAlicia formed in the north-central part of the Gulf of Mexico on August 15. It traveled west, strengthening into a hurricane. It quickly reached Category 3 strength as it approached the Texas coastline, and made landfall at Galveston, Texas on August 18 at its strongest intensity. The storm then moved northward, its eye passing over Houston. Alicia still kept its tropical characteristics while over land, but eventually becoming extratropical and combining itself with another storm over northern Kansas on September 21. A total of 21 people died in the storm, which caused $5.1 billion (2005 USD) of damages.\nHurricane Barry.\nAn African tropical wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry for a short time just off the east coast of Florida on August 24. Barry weakened to a depression just before it made landfall near Melbourne, Florida, but managed to cross the Florida peninsula and continued west across the Gulf of Mexico. In the central Gulf, it began to restrengthen, and was a minimal Category 1 hurricane when it made landfall in northeastern Mexico. Barry then began to quickly weaken over land at about 1200 UTC August 29 and soon dissipated.\nHurricane Chantal.\nA group of scattered tropical thunderstorms 200 km south of Bermuda, strengthened into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season. An Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 35\u00a0kt (40\u00a0mph, 65\u00a0km/h) and was named Tropical Storm Chantal. Chantal continued to strengthen and developed into a minimal hurricane with 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) winds on September 11 and maintained that strength until September 13, when it weakened back into a tropical storm.\nChantal travelled northeast over open waters, missing the island of Bermuda, before weakening and being destroyed by a frontal system on September 15. As Chantal never made landfall, no damage or fatalities were reported that was related to the storm. However, Chantal created giant waves that were 30\u201340\u00a0ft (9\u201312\u00a0m) high across the East Coast of the United States.\nTropical Depression Six.\nThis was a depression that formed over the Lesser Antilles. It caused no major damage.\nTropical Storm Dean.\nTropical Storm Dean was a short-lived storm that began as a subtropical storm which developed between Bermuda and the Bahamas on September 26. The subtropical storm headed north-northeast and became tropical the next day. Gale warnings were issued from North Carolina to New England that were produced by Dean, but the storm turned northwest and made landfall on the eastern shore of Virginia on September 30. The storm died out several hours later. Dean was one of only two tropical storms ever to make landfall in eastern shore of Virginia, the other storm being Tropical Storm Bret from the 1981 season.\nOverall damage turned out to be light with only minor beach erosion and flooding along parts of the Virginian coastline.\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Rating.\nThe table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season. ACE means the measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have higher ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35\u00a0knots (39\u00a0mph, 63\u00a0km/h) or tropical storm strength. The 1983 season had a cumulative ACE of 16.86 (17), which is extremely below normal and currently the least active season on record since 1914, which had an ACE rating of 2.53."}

She was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The Russian Orthodox Church canonised her as Saint Alexandra in 2000.\nAlexandra is best remembered as the last Tsarina of Russia. She is also one of the most famous royal carriers of the haemophilia disease. Her friendship with the Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin was also an important part of her life.\nEarly life.\nAlexandra Fyodorovna was born Princess Alix Viktoria Helene Luise Beatrix in Darmstadt, Hesse and by Rhine. That area was a part of the German Empire at the time. Her father was Grand Duke Louis IV. Her mother was the former Princess Alice, the second daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.\nIn November of 1878, diphtheria swept through Hesse. Alix, her sisters, Irene and May and brother, Ernst were infected by the disease. Her sister, May, died shortly before the end of the month but the others got better. Alix's mother became sick after caring for Ernie when he came down with the disease. Princess Alice died on December 14, 1878. Princess Alix became very close to her maternal grandmother. She was often thought to be Victoria's favourite granddaughter. Because of this, Alix spent many of her early years in the United Kingdom. In 1892 when she was twenty, her father died, and her brother, Ernst, became the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine.\nMarriage.\nWhen she grew up, Alix was a beautiful woman, with reddish-blonde hair, high cheek bones, pale skin, dark blue eyes, and long dark eyelashes. Alix was married relatively late for a princess in those times. She had already refused to marry Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) even though her family wanted her to marry him. She had, however, already met a relative by marriage, the Tsesarevich of Russia. His uncle Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich was married to Alix's sister Elizabeth. At first, Nicholas' father, Tsar Alexander III, told them they could not get married. He later changed his mind as his health began get bad. Alix did not like the need that she had to turn away from her Lutheran faith. The Russian Tsarina had to be an Orthodox. She later changed her mind and in time became a strong convert to the faith. She and Nicholas became engaged in April 1894. Alexander III died in November of that year, and Nicholas became Tsar of Russia at the age of twenty-six. The couple were married 14 November 1894.\nExecution of the Royal family.\nThe Tsar and Tsarina and all of their family, along with several family servants, were executed early in the morning during the night of July 17, 1918, by a detachment of Bolsheviks led by Yakov Yurovsky. Alexandra watched the murder of her husband and two servants before Peter Ermakov killed her with a gun shot to the left side of her head before she could finish making the sign of the cross. Ermakov, in a drunken haze, stabbed her dead body and that of her husband's, shattering both their rib cages.\nIdentification and burial.\nAfter the execution of the Romanov family, Alexandra's body, along with Nicholas, their children and some servants who died with them, was stripped and the clothing burnt. At first, the bodies were thrown down an unused mine shaft, 12 miles north of Yekaterinburg. A short time later they were retrieved. Their faces and bodies were badly damaged so they could not be recognized. All of the bodies except for two of the children were later buried again. The bodies missing are believed to be those of a daughter- Maria or Anastasia- and Alexis. In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, what is believed to be the bodies of most of the family were found and identified."}

{"id": "60687", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60687", "title": "Fire salamander", "text": "The fire salamander (\"Salamandra salamandra\") is a species of salamander which can be found in Europe. It is black and has different kinds of yellow spots or stripes. Some salamanders are mostly black while others are mostly yellow. Shades of red and orange may sometimes appear. They either mix with the yellow, or replace it completely. This depends on the subspecies. Fire salamanders can have a very long life. In the German natural history museum of Alexander Koenig a salamander lived more than 50 years.\nWhere they live and what they eat.\nFire salamanders live in forests in the hilly parts of southern and central Europe. They prefer deciduous forests. They like to hide in the fallen leaves or mossy tree trunks. They need clean small brooks (small rivers) in their habitat. This is for the development of the larvae. Both on land and in the water, Fire salamanders are hard to notice. \nThey spend much of the time hidden beneath stones, wood or other objects.\nFire salamanders are active in the evening and the night, but on rainy days they may be active in daytime as well. Their diet consists of insects, spiders, earthworms and slugs. Sometimes, they will eat small vertebrates\u2014for example, newts and young frogs. Small prey will be caught within the range of the vomerine teeth or by the posterior half of the tongue, which sticks to the prey.\nHow they reproduce.\nMales and females look pretty similar except during the breeding season, when the most conspicuous difference is a swollen gland around the male's vent. This gland produces the spermatophore, which carries a sperm packet at its tip. The courtship happens on land. After the male becomes aware of a potential mate, he confronts her and blocks her path. The male deposits his spermatophore on the ground. Reproduction occurs by means of this spermatophore, which will be taken up by the female. Their gills develop lungs. Neotenic fire salamanders have not been observed.\nHow they defend themselves against being eaten.\nSalamanders may actively defend themselves once they are grasped by a predator. Besides various antipredator postures, \"S. salamandra\" adults are able to make strong poisons. These usually act on the nerves of the predator. They are called neurotoxins. One such poison is the alkaloid Samandarin. When the salamander senses danger, it can secrete this through its skin. This alkaloid causes strong muscle convulsions and high-blood pressure combined with hyperventilation in all vertebrates. The poison glands of the Fire salamander are concentrated in certain areas of the body, especially around the head and the dorsal skin surface. The colored portions of the animals skin usually coincide with these glands. Most of these secretions might be effective against bacterial and fungal infections of the epidermis, but some secretions could also be dangerous to human life.\nWhere they occur.\nFire salamanders are found in most of southern and central Europe. They are most commonly found at altitudes between 400 and 1000 m, only rarely below (in Northern Germany sporadically down to 25 m). However, in the Balkans or in Spain they are commonly found in higher altitudes as well.\nCommon names.\n\"Salamandra salamandra\" (Linnaeus, 1758)\nSubspecies.\nSeveral subspecies of the Fire salamander are recognized. Most notable are the subspecies \"fastuosa\" and \"bernadezi\". These two are the only viviparous subspecies \u2013 the others are ovoviviparous.\nSome former subspecies are today recognized as species due to genetic reasons."}

She had the head of a lioness and the body of a woman. She was married to Ptah, the god of healing. They balanced each other. It was believed that her breath created the desert.\nSometimes known as sister to Bastet/Bast, a goddess who protected pregnant women and children.\nPhysical appearance.\nSekhmet had the head of a lioness and the body of a woman. She was usually depicted with a sun disc on top of her head. Many historians argue that she was from Sudan, since lions were plentiful there. When she was seated, she usually held the ankh of life, but when she was standing, she held a papyrus scepter, the symbol of Lower Egypt.\nPower.\nSekhmet's breath represented a hot desert wind, and her body was the glare of the midday sun. She was created when Hathor came down to earth to take vengeance on man. Sekhmet became the destructive eye of the sun, and a solar goddess, and was named \u201cEye of Ra.\u201d The ancient Egyptians knew that the sun could bring life, (Hathor), but also death. (Sekhmet). Her name translates as \"The Powerful One.\" Sekhmet used her power destructively and brutally\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Sekhmet took over sun and then the next morning she gave birth to the moon.\nFear of Sekhmet.\nPeople were afraid of Sekhmet because along with her healing and protective powers, she was also destructive and retaliating. The ancient Egyptians believed that the \"Seven Arrows of Sekhmet\" would bring bad luck, so they used many charms and spells to protect themselves. There was a \"Book of the Last Day of the Year\" which they recited over a piece of cloth and wore around their neck at the end of the year. This was considered to be a dangerous time. On the first day of the New Year (Wep Ronpet), people would exchange amulets in the form of Sekhmet to keep the goddess happy.\nWorship.\nSekhmet had an unusual form of worship. She was worshipped evenly with her husband, Ptah, and her son, Nefertem. Her main cult center was in Memphis. Many priests recited complicated prayers, used to avert the rage of Sekhmet. A well-known prayer was called \"The Last Day of the Year,\" and it was chanted while wearing a piece of cloth around one's head. The last day of the year was considered to be a dangerous period for the people, because Sekhmet usually attacked then.\nSekhmet was the Egyptian goddess of war and destruction. She was bloodthirsty, out of control, and the Egyptians thought she represented natural disasters. Her husband, Ptah, and her son, Nefertem were closely worshipped. Sekhmet was known as the lady of life, and the lady of terror. In one myth, Sekhmet terrorized the country of Egypt, crazy and thirsty for blood. Ra, the sun god, sent many swift-footed messengers to outsmart her. She saw through all, and then saw love through everything, and Sekhmet in her happiness, embraced it. She lay back and later turned into Hathor, the goddess of love.\nCult Center.\nSekhmet\u2019s main cult center was located in Memphis. When Amenemhat officially moved the capital of Egypt to Itjtawy, her cult center moved too. Her large similarity to Hathor brought the special erection of dual temples where citizens could worship Sekhmet and Hathor. Hundreds of jahovas were set up during the reign of Amenhotep III. At their bases, they emphasize Sekhmet's savagery and brutal myths.\nResources.\nAncient Egypt. Oakes, Lorna, &amp; Gahlin, Lucia. 268-269"}

As an adjective, \"heterodox\" is used to describe a subject as \"characterized by departure from accepted beliefs or standards\" (\"status quo\"). \nEcclesiastic usage.\nEastern Orthodoxy.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the term is used to refer to Christian churches not belonging to the Eastern Orthodox communion, but have no positions that are as different from those of Orthodox Christianity to thought to be as false as heresy.\nRoman Catholicism.\nHeterodoxy in the Roman Catholic Church in a similar way means views that differ from strictly orthodox views, but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid heresy. \nMany Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views, either on doctrinal or social issues. For example, the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain, and \"the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1261). A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment. The belief is not orthodox, as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants; however, it is also not heresy, as the Church accepts that such a scenario \"might\" be possible. By contrast, a denial of the doctrine of \"Original Sin\" (thereby negating the necessity of baptism for children) or Papal Infallibility -- would be labeled heretical.\nOther denominations.\nThe term \"heterodox\" is occasionally used by some Christians to refer to themselves when they are in disagreement with orthodox understandings. The heterodox Christians remain in the tradition and attempt a constructive dialog around issues with which they disagree."}

Players buy and trade cards, and build their own card decks. Decks must have at least 60 cards. Players can play in tournaments, and there are even professional \"Magic\" players. Most players of Magic: The Gathering simply call the game \"Magic\". The game is in a fantasy world involving magic. Richard Garfield made the game in 1993. It is said to be the first trading card game. The current Head Designer is Mark Rosewater, who also writes a weekly article about the game called \"Making Magic.\"\n2 or more people play the game. Players attack each other causing them to lose life points. Each player starts at 20 life points. There are many kinds of cards that can be used to reduce another player's life. Players can attack another player with a creature or deal direct damage with a spell. You win the game by reducing your opponent's life to 0, when your opponent runs out of cards to draw, or when a card says that you win the game.\nHistory.\nRichard Garfield started to make the game at University of Pennsylvania. In 1993 he showed the game to the game company Wizards of the Coast. The company liked the game, and started to produce it.\nThe first cards were made in 1993. The cards are produced in groups of cards called \"sets\". The first sets were very successful, so more sets were made. About four sets are produced each year. Cards made before 2003 look different than newer cards, but are still compatible with the modern game in most cases.\nProfessional \"Magic\" began in 1996. Professionals play in tournaments around the world in the . A player can win as much as $40,000 in one tournament.\nMagic: The Gathering Online (MTGO) was made in 2002. \"Magic\" players can now play their favorite game on the internet. A new MTGO was released in 2008. Also, a new online version called MTG Arena was released in 2019.\nGenerally more males play the game than females.\nPlaying the Game.\nA game of \"Magic\" is played by two or more players. A player starts the game with twenty \"life points\". A player loses when he or she has zero or fewer life points. There are different ways to lose life points: players play \"creature\" cards and attack other players with them, or players play spells on other players. There are also other ways for players to lose: they have no cards in their deck, they have 10 \"poison counters\", or a card is played that says they lose.\nPlayers begin the game by shuffling their decks (mixing up their cards) and then taking up seven cards. Each card has a different power. Players takes one new card at the start of each turn, but the first player does not take a card on their first turn. There are many steps in each turn. Certain cards can only be played in certain steps. A player can have no more than seven cards at the end of their turn. If they do, they must put cards into their \"graveyard\" (next to their deck) till they only have seven.\nThere are two basic kinds of cards: \"spells\" and \"lands\". Lands give its player \"mana\" (magical energy). Mana is used to \"cast spells\". A player may only play one land each turn. More powerful spells take more mana to play. There are also different kinds of spells. \"Sorceries\" and \"instants\" are played, and go directly to the \"graveyard\" after their effects take place. \"Permanents\" stay in play after they are played, and their effects stay as well. \"Creatures\" are a special kind of permanent that can attack and damage other players.\nlegendary creatures and planeswalkers are a totally different matter.\nColors of \"Magic\".\nMost spells are one of five colors: white, blue, black, red, and green. To play a spell, at least one mana that is the same color as the spell is needed. Players normally get this mana from \"basic lands\": \"plains\" for white, \"island\" for blue, \"swamp\" for black, \"mountain\" for red, and \"forest\" for green. Each color has strengths and weaknesses, with white magic dealing in protection and defense, blue magic dealing with manipulation and thinking, black magic dealing in death and greed, red magic dealing in fire and emotion, and green magic dealing in strength and nature.\nArtwork.\nEach card has a picture that gives an idea of the power of the card. Card sets are usually made along with stories, and the pictures on cards generally show actions, events or characters in the stories.\nAwards.\nRichard Garfield and Donato Giancola have also won personal awards for \"Magic\"."}

After the fertilization of the eggs, the male will guard them for at least six months. At this point, the offspring will live off their noticeable stored fat until they are ready to hunt. Once ready they will hunt as a group rather than individually.\nScientists at Asa Zoo in Japan have recently discovered that the male salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den. Sometimes the male \"den master\" will also allow a second male into the den, but the reason for this is unclear."}

His nickname was the \"Red Baron\". He is considered the ace-of-aces of the war, being officially credited with 80 air combat victories. The \"Red Baron\" is one of the most famous aviators in history and the subject of numerous representations in music, film and other media. He already received numerous honors and award for his exploits.\nRichthofen was born in Breslau, Germany.\nIn August 1914, Richthofen became a cavalry officer in World War I. In May 1915, he joined the air service and became an observer. He did that because the training course was shorter and would get him to fighting faster. In October, he began training as a pilot. In March 1916, he entered combat. He had his first victory in April. In 1917, he was in command of a squadron nicknamed the \"flying circus\". He painted his airplane red so his fellow Germans could see him. Richthofen\u2019s sixteenth victory flying a plane made him the best pilot in Germany in 1917.\nOn April 21, 1918, Richthofen was fatally shot, whilst flying low above the Somme Valley, near Amiens while fighting in France. He was 25 years old. He was chasing an enemy plane when a bullet passed through his chest. He then made a smooth landing, in a field on a hill near the Bray-Corbie road, just north of Vaux-sur-Somme. His Fokker Dr.I was not damaged by the landing. One witness, Gunner George Ridgway, said that Richthofen was still alive when he and other Australian soldiers reached the plane, but he died moments later. Another eyewitness, Sergeant Ted Smout, said that Richthofen's last word was \"kaputt\" (\"finished\"), immediately before he died.\nCanadian fighter pilot Arthur Roy Brown was officially credited with killing Richthofen. However, it is now generally agreed that the bullet that killed Richthofen was fired from the ground. The enemy buried Richthofen's body with full military honors."}

He received the nickname \"Butch\" as a youth and continues to use the name professionally as an adult. Hartman spent his childhood in Roseville, Michigan and his teen years in New Baltimore, Michigan.\nHe graduated from Anchor Bay High School in New Baltimore in 1983. He subsequently attended the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California.\nEarly career.\nWhile still attending the California Institute of the Arts, Hartman received the chance to intern as an in-between animator on the Don Bluth film, \"An American Tail\". Shortly after graduating for the California Institute of the Arts Hartman was hired as a character designer for the animated series \"My Little Pony\". Instead, they had him working on storyboards (which he had not done before) and as quickly as he was hired, he was fired.\nSoon after Hartman found work with Ruby Slash, where he worked on \"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\", \"Captain N: The Game Master\" and \"Gadget Boy &amp; Heather\".\nHe was also a video reference crew for the Disney movie Pocahontas.Later, he became a writer, television director and storyboard artist for several Hanna-Barbera shows, including \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Cow and Chicken\", and \"Johnny Bravo\".\nAfter his contract with Hanna-Barbera finished up he went to work with former co-worker Fred Seibert on \"Oh,Yeah!Cartoons\".\nHe's also a friend of Seth MacFarlane and worked on MacFarlane's animated short \"Zoomates\" and \"Dan Danger\" with Steve Marmel. MacFarlane also has a character on Family Guy named after Hartman named Dr. Hartman.\n\"The Fairly OddParents\" and \"Danny Phantom\".\nHis biggest success came in 1997, when he created \"The Fairly OddParents\". (The idea came to him during the drive from Hanna-Barbera to Nickelodeon to pitch an idea to Fred Seibert.) It was originally a series of made for TV shorts on the anthology show, \"Oh Yeah!Cartoons\". In 2001, Nickelodeon picked it up as a full series. \"The Fairly OddParents\" became a huge hit, second only in the ratings to \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". Due to the success of \"OddParents\", Hartman was asked to create another cartoon for Nickelodeon, (Hartman says the President of Nickelodeon asked him if he had an idea, and before he could say the title he was given a contract.) \"Danny Phantom\", in 2004. \"The Fairly OddParents\" ceased production in 2006, but it was announced on Hartman's website on February 2, 2007 that 20 more episodes will be produced. On July 11, 2007, The first new episode of Danny Phantom was aired on the Nicktoons Network. Danny Phantom ended production on August 24, 2007. The 7th Season of The Fairly OddParents aired on February 18, 2008, starting with the 1-hour special Fairly Odd Baby.\n\"Doogal\".\nHartman was asked to serve as executive producer and screenwriter of \"Doogal\", the Americanized dub of the British/French animated film \"The Magic Roundabout\". Butch Hartman revealed in an 2017 interview during the Weinstein scandal that the film was originally supposed to include a live-action frame story similar to \"The Princess Bride\" but it was scrapped due to budget costs and therefore replaced with Judi Dench's narration. Hartman even revealed that the original U.S. movie poster had his name and his production company Billionfold Inc. on it, until they were removed in later posters in copyright favor of both Path\u00e9 and Action Synthese's credits. He later expressed long-harbored remorse for his involvement where he revealed that most of his actual script was actually rewritten without his consent by producer Harvey Weinstein and his distribution and production company The Weinstein Company with a screenplay by Hoodwinked! co-director Cory Edwards; he also claimed that only 3% of his original script made it into the final film.\nThe film was then dubbed by The Weinstein Company, and was released on February 24, 2006. However, \"Doogal\" was poorly received by critics, and did poorly in the box-office, grossing only $7 million and getting 7% on Rotten Tomatoes.\nOther and future works.\nHartman is currently working on two new projects for Nickelodeon: one, a live-action series and the other, animated. It has also been stated that 20 more episodes of \"The Fairly OddParents\" are currently under production and if possible, he may decide to go ahead and work on a theatrical feature film \"The Fairly OddParents Movie\" as well. He also has a brand new cartoon series 'T.U.F.F. PUPPY' set to premiere on Nickelodeon in October, 2010.

They were used by the French composer Olivier Messiaen.\nMajor scales have twelve different transpositions. This means that a major scale can start on any of the twelve notes (C, C#, D, D# etc.). There are also twelve different transpositions of the minor scale. Each transposition (\u201ceach scale\u201d) is a different combination of notes (in this case: all of them).\nA chromatic scale (one which uses every note, i.e. using all white and black notes of a keyboard) only has one transposition. This means that a chromatic scale can start on any note: each time it is the same combination of notes.\nMessiaen was fascinated by scales that only had a few (usually two or three) transpositions. For example: the whole tone scale, which rises by a whole tone each time, has two transpositions. It can start, for example, on a C, so that the notes are C, D, E, F#, G#, A#, C. It can start on a C# so that the notes are C#, D#, F, G, A, B, C#. Transposing this up another semitone, starting on D, would give D, E, F#, G#, A#, C, D which is exactly the same combination of notes as the first one (the starting note is not important). The whole-tone scale was used by many composers including Glinka, Liszt and, especially, Debussy. Messiaen called it the \"first mode\" of transposition.\nMessiaen\u2019s \"second mode\", also called the \u201coctatonic scale\u201d, rises by alternating semitone, tone, semitone, tone etc. Messiaen used this scale a great deal, not just in his tunes but in the chords that he used (i.e. melodically and harmonically).\nThe \"third mode\" rises by a pattern of tone, semitone, semitone. It has four transpositions.\nThe other four modes each have a total of six transpositions.\nMessiaen liked these modes because there is no note which sounds like the starting note. All the notes sound equal. He described them as having \"the charm of impossibilities.\""}

He is the most famous French composer of the mid-20th century and one of the most important and original composers of his time. He was a brilliant organist and played the organ at the church of La Trinit\u00e9 in Paris for over 60 years. He wrote music for orchestra, piano and organ, most of which is very difficult to play. He was also a great music teacher who taught several young students who became well-known composers e.g. Pierre Boulez, Yvonne Loriod (who became his second wife), Karlheinz Stockhausen, George Benjamin and Iannis Xenakis.\nBiography.\nMessiaen started to compose when he was seven years old. When he was given the score of Debussy\u2019s opera \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" he could imagine the music in his head and he knew he wanted to be a composer. He went to the Paris Conservatoire when he was 11. His teachers included some famous composers such as Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupr\u00e9. He was appointed organist at the church of La Trinit\u00e9 in Paris in 1930, a post he held until his death.\nWhen World War II broke out Messiaen was made a prisoner of war in 1940. While he was held in a Silesian camp he composed a work which was to become a very famous piece of chamber music: the \"Quatour pour la fin du temps\" (\"Quartet for the end of time\") for piano, violin, cello, and clarinet. He composed for these instruments because they were the instruments available. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners to an audience of 5000 inmates and prison guards.\nWhen he was free again in 1941 Messiaen became professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire. He composed 20 pieces for piano which are called \"Vingt regards sur l\u2019enfant J\u00e9sus\" (\"Twenty visions of the child Jesus\"). He wrote a book about the way he composed, called \"Technique de mon langage musical\" (\"The Technique of my musical language\").\nMessiaen soon became famous for his teaching and was invited to teach in other countries such as Germany, Hungary and the United States. He became interested in the rhythms of Greek and Hindu music.\nHis first wife died in 1959 and he remarried in 1961. He also became very interested in birdsong and spent a lot of time with his wife in the country with a tape recorder recording birdsong. He imitated the birdsong in his music, especially in piano pieces called \"Oiseaux exotiques\" (\"Exotic birds\") and the \"Catalogue d\u2019oiseaux\" (\"Catalogue of birds\").\nMessiaen wrote a lot of organ music which he performed himself. One very popular work is called \"Transports de joie\" (\"Outburst of joy\"). It is one of four pieces called \"L'Ascension\" (The Ascension). A much longer work, consisting of nine movements, is the \"La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur\" (\"The Birth of our Lord\"). The last movement of this piece is a toccata called \"Dieu parmi nous\" (\"God among us\"). It has become a favourite piece for organists to play at recitals or after Christmas carol services.\nMessiaen wrote a long piece for orchestra called the \" Turangal\u00eela \" Symphony. It was first performed in Boston in 1949 with Bernstein conducting. The French government commissioned a piece called \"Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum\" (\"And we expect the rising of the dead\") which was dedicated to people who had died in the two world wars. It was performed in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and then in Chartres Cathedral in 1965 in the presence of General Charles de Gaulle. In 1966 Messiaen became professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire.\nHis visit to the Grand Canyon inspired him to write a ten-movement orchestral piece called \"Des Canyons aux \u00e9toiles\" (\"From the canyons to the stars\"), which was first performed in 1974 in New York.\nMessiaen had been asked in 1971 to write an opera for the Paris Op\u00e9ra. At first he did not want to start such a large work, but in 1975 he was persuaded to accept the commission and began work on his \"Saint-Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise\". It took him several years to compose. It was performed in 1983. Messiaen said that he preferred to call it a \u201cspectacle\u201d instead of an \u201copera\u201d.\nMessiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire in 1978. In 1987 he was given the highest rank: the Grand-Croix\" of the \"L\u00e9gion d'honneur\".\nMessiaen was in a lot of pain near the end of his life. He needed operations on his back. He still managed to finish a piece called \"\u00c9clairs sur l'au del\u00e0\", which was first performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra six months after the composer's death. Messiaen had also been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to: his wife Loriod, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin. This was nearly finished when Messiaen died, and Yvonne Loriod orchestrated the last movement with advice from George Benjamin.\nMusic style.\nMessiaen said of himself that he was a \u201ccomposer and rhythmician\u201d. He meant by this that rhythm was very important in his music. He taught himself all about Greek metres although he did not speak the Greek language. He liked rhythms which use odd numbers. Very often a bar of his music may have one extra semiquaver so that there might be 17 semiquavers in a bar. He studied Hindu rhythms and found ways of changing the rhythms during the music. He was very influenced by the rhythms in Stravinsky\u2019s famous piece \"The Rite of Spring\".\nMessiaen\u2019s harmonies are very individual. He was fascinated by scales which can only be transposed in two or three different ways. He called these scales \u201cmodes of limited transposition\u201d.\nMessiaen\u2019s music is full of different sounds. He wrote extremely well for large orchestras and for the organ, using different instruments or organ sounds in very original ways, e.g. in \"Chronochromie\" (1960) for large orchestra and \"M\u00e9ditations sur le myst\u00e8re de la Sainte Trinit\u00e9\".(1969), a work which uses styles from his earlier period together with birdsong. Messiaen had synesthesia which meant that music often made him think of particular colours. In his orchestra Messiaen often used an instrument called the ondes Martenot which was a kind of electronic keyboard instrument. His sister-in-law Jeanne Loriod was a famous player of the ondes Martenot. Messiaen was also influenced by Indonesian gamelan music. For a short time he experimented with total serialism.\nIn some of his later works such as the \"La Transfiguration de notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus-Christ\", for choir of 100 voices, seven instrumental soloists and large orchestra, composed in the late 1960s, he used a simpler musical language which has helped it to become very popular.\nMessiaen was a devout Roman Catholic all his life.

As its name shows, it is made of characters that have in part been \"simplified\" from the original written form, which are called traditional Chinese characters.\nHistory.\nWhen the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, the Communist Party of China under Mao Zedong wanted to help the Chinese people read and write. Before 1949, most Chinese people could not read. The government hoped that by using fewer strokes to write characters, along with many other changes in the education system, the Chinese language would become more standardized like Japanese. The Empire of Japan had brought changes to the Japanese writing system during the earlier Meiji Restoration to make literacy and education more widely available to all Japanese citizens. Mao also hoped that simplifying Chinese characters would begin to shift Chinese people away from using the character system itself and that eventually Chinese-speakers would only use a phonetic alphabet to write.\nThe first set of simplified Chinese characters were first put to public use in 1956. Over time, more characters became \"simplified\", or existing ones changed, once in 1964 and again in 1978 and 1984. Many people did not like these changes because too many characters with different meanings were merged.\nIn hopes of promoting phonetic writing, the CCP was also working creating a standard romanization to accurately represent the pronunciation of Standard Chinese, pinyin. It was first taught in primary schools in 1958.\nRoughly 2,000 Chinese characters have been simplified.\nCurrent use.\nToday, simplified Chinese characters are used throughout Mainland China. It is also taught and used in some countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, and Malaysia.\nSince the Republic of China fled to Taiwan and became separated from the rest of China, the government there did not choose to simplify its writing system, and so it still uses the older traditional Chinese characters. The territories of Hong Kong and Macau have also kept using traditional characters, even though they are politically part of the rest of China, which switched to simplified characters.\nIt could not be proven that Simplified Chinese characters were able to help people with reading and writing. As places using Traditional Chinese characters did not have literacy problems, in 2009 Pan Qing-Lin, a Chinese official, suggested to stop using Simplified Chinese characters. This did not happen.\nIn multi-racial societies, like Singapore, students have been learning a second language for many years. Because of this, Simplified Chinese characters are welcomed by students. People who learned the simplified set had little problem changing over to the traditional set. Even to this day, there are many reasons for the need to use traditional Chinese characters, such as working in places that did not adapt the simplified Chinese characters or reading older books that have not yet been translated to Simplified Chinese characters.\nMost simplified characters have far fewer strokes. For example, the traditional character \u99ac has 10 strokes, while its simplified version \u9a6c only has 3 strokes. However, there are some simplified characters with more strokes than their traditional versions. For example, the traditional character \u5f37 has 11 strokes, while the simplified version \u5f3a has 12 strokes. \nSimplified vs. traditional characters.\nBelow is a list of simplified characters next to their traditional versions.\nThere are several ways to simplify characters."}

As its name shows, it is the \"traditional\" written form of the Chinese language that first came about during the Han Dynasty (shortly after the Qin Dynasty) in 206 BC. The name \"traditional\" is used to set them apart from simplified Chinese characters.\nCourt officials in the Han Dynasty believed that small seal script characters, which were standardized under Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi when he unified China, took too much time to write because Chinese characters at the time were written using curved lines instead of more angular lines. So Han officials decided to simplify writing Chinese characters by using multiple strokes, or lines, to form characters and radicals, rather than long curved lines. The changed small seal script characters are now commonly known as Hanzi (Simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u5b57 / Traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57, meaning \"Han characters\"), because they were from the Han Dynasty. Hanzi became the standard writing system of Chinese and it even spread to other countries and languages. It was also used (with some differences) in the Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese languages.\nToday, Japanese is the only non-Chinese language that still uses Chinese characters in daily life. They call them Kanji. After WWII, the Japanese simplified many of the characters. They called their simplified characters Shinjitai (which are not to be confused with simplified characters in Chinese), while traditional characters were called Kyujitai.\nThe older, \"traditional\" forms of Chinese characters remained more or less the same (although there were a few changes now and then) until the People's Republic of China (PRC) was formed in 1949. At that time, the Communist Party of China (CPC) started to create simplified Chinese characters, in which anywhere between 20-30% of all the Chinese characters used in daily life were replaced by ones that had fewer strokes and were easier to write. This move by the CPC, which took place in the 1950s throughout Mainland China, was made in order to make education more available to common people, especially farmers.\nAt the same time, the government of the Republic of China, which had fled to Taiwan, chose not to simplify its writing system. They continue to use traditional Chinese characters, believing that simplified characters were made to take away important details in traditional characters in order to limit thought. The Cantonese-speaking territories of Hong Kong and Macau have also kept using traditional characters, even though they are politically part of the PRC, which uses simplified characters. The Chinese taught as a second language in Southeast Asia uses simplified characters, and the government of Singapore and the Chinese community in Malaysia have adopted simplified characters as their standard script. Many immigrant communities of overseas Chinese also tend to use traditional rather than simplified characters.\nTraditional vs. simplified characters.\nBelow is a list of simplified characters next to their traditional versions."}

It explains movement of the Earth's lithosphere: this is the earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle. The lithosphere is divided into plates, some of which are very large and can be entire continents.\nHeat from the mantle is the source of energy driving plate tectonics. Exactly how this works is still a matter of debate.\nEarth's crust.\nThe outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers. The lithosphere, above, includes the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle.\nBelow the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is like a solid or a hot viscous liquid. It can flow like a liquid on long time scales. Large convection currents in the asthenosphere transfer heat to the surface, where plumes of less dense magma break apart the plates at the spreading centers. The deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again. This is caused by extremely high pressure.\nContinental and oceanic plates.\nThere are two types of tectonic plates: oceanic and continental.\nAn oceanic plate is a tectonic plate at the bottom of the oceans. It is primarily made of mafic rocks, rich in iron and magnesium. It is thinner than the continental crust (generally less than 10 kilometers thick) and denser. It is also younger than continental crust. When they collide, the oceanic plate moves underneath the continental plate because of its density. As a result, it melts in the mantle and reforms. The oldest oceanic rocks are less than 200 million years old.\nContinental plate is the thick part of the earth's crust which forms the large land masses. Continental rock has lower density than oceanic rock. They are mostly made of felsic rocks. These have granite, with its abundant silica, aluminum, sodium and potassium. Continental plates are rarely destroyed. Their oldest rocks seem to be 4 billion years old. Oceanic plates cover about 71 percent of Earth\u2019s surface, while continental plates cover 29 percent.\nThickness of plates.\nOcean lithosphere varies in thickness. Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, it gets thicker as it moves further away from the mid-ocean ridge. Typically, the thickness varies from about thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than at subduction zones.\nContinental lithosphere is about thick. It varies between basins, mountain ranges, and the stable cratonic interiors of continents. The two types of crust differ in thickness, with continental crust being much thicker than oceanic: vs. .\nMovement of plates.\nThe lithosphere consists of \"tectonic plates\". There are seven major and many minor plates. The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere (aesthenosphere). The plate boundary is where two plates meet. When movement occurs, the plates may create mountains, earthquakes, volcanoes, mid-oceanic ridges and oceanic trenches, depending on which way the plates are moving.\nEarthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries. The lateral movement of the plates varies from:\nMajor plates.\nDepending on how they are defined, seven or eight major plates are usually listed:"}

That means the crust, plus the part of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on long time scales. \nUnder the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle. This part can flow. \nThe lithosphere provides a conductive lid atop the convecting mantle: it reduces heat transport through the Earth, A lithosphere (Ancient Greek: \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 [lithos] for \"rocky\", and \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 [sphaira] for \"sphere\") is the rigid,[1] outermost shell of a terrestrial-type planet or natural satellite that is defined by its rigid mechanical properties. On Earth, it is composed of the crust and the portion of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on time scales of thousands of years or greater. The outermost shell of a rocky planet, the crust, is defined on the basis of its chemistry and mineralogy.\nTypes of lithosphere :-.\nThere are two types of lithosphere:\nThe lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates, which move gradually relative to one another. \nOceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle, and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly dense with age. Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years, but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. \nWhen a continental plate comes together with an oceanic plate, at a subduction zones, the oceanic lithosphere always sinks beneath the continental. \nNew oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 200 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. \nAnother distinguishing characteristic of the lithosphere is its flow properties. Under the influence of the low-intensity, long-term stresses that drive tectonic motion, the lithosphere is like a rigid shell. It changes mainly by breaking (\"brittle failure\"). The asthenosphere (the layer of the mantle below the lithosphere) is heat-softened and adjusts by plastic changes (\"deformation\").\nOceanic lithosphere is made up of mostly basalt and gabbro. Continental lithosphere is made up of granite and gneiss."}

Andrew dissipated south of Cape Cod. One person drowned off the North Carolina coast in high surf, but no major damages was reported.\nHurricane Bonnie.\nTropical Depression Two formed south of the Louisiana coast on June 23 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane. Bonnie made landfall on the upper Texas coast near High Island. Streets were flooded throughout southeast Texas, mobile homes were destroyed, and three people were killed. Bonnie caused $2 million (1986 USD) in damage.\nHurricane Charley.\nA tropical depression formed off the coast of the Florida and moved inland. The depression then travelled across Florida and exited the coast near Savannah, Georgia, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Charley. Charley continued moving up the coastline, and the storm strengthened into a hurricane before moving across the Outer Banks and Delmarva Peninsula. Charley then moved out into the sea, later became extratropical in the north Atlantic Ocean, and later brought bad weather across the British Isles on August 25 where it caused major damages.\nTropical Storm Danielle.\nOn September 1, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and moved west. The disturbance was below the 10 degree latitude as it developed into a tropical depression on September 7 and then strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. Danielle peaked as a 60\u00a0mph storm on September 8, while a Reconnaissance Aircraft reported gusts of up to hurricane force. After passing through the Lesser Antilles, Danielle came across vertical wind shear, and on September 10, it dissipated in the central Caribbean Sea. The remnants of Danielle continued to move west and eventually redeveloped in the Pacific Ocean as Tropical Storm Lester.\nHurricane Earl.\nThe strongest storm of the season began as a tropical wave off Africa on September 4. After moving across the tropical Atlantic Ocean it strengthened as Tropical Depression Five on September 10 while about 1240 miles (2000 km) east of Puerto Rico. The depression quickly strengthened and reached hurricane strength on September 11; Earl reached its strongest point on September 12, as a Category 2 hurricane as it travelled in a half circle.\nThe hurricane weakened to a Category 1 on September 16 and bounced back the way it came. Earl then turned north and became extratropical southeast of Newfoundland on September 19. At its strongest point, Earl had sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 979 mbar.\nHurricane Frances.\nTropical Depression Six formed on November 18 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. The storm curved northeast and strengthened further, reaching hurricane strength on November 20. However, a high pressure system to the north caused the storm to fall apart. Frances was later destroyed by an extratropical low on November 21.\nStorm names.\nThese were the names set aside to be used in 1986 Atlantic hurricane.

The city is Ghana's largest city. It is also the administrative, communications, and economic center of the country. The main economic activities in Accra are financial and government services, communications, construction, transportation and agriculture (mostly fishing). Most of Ghana's ability to make build things is in the capital area.\nHistory of Accra.\nAccra was founded by the Ga people in the late 1600s. The word Accra comes from the word \"Nkran\" meaning ants. This is because of the many anthills seen in the countryside around Accra. During part of its history, Accra was a very important place for trade with the Portuguese. The Portuguese built a fort in the town. Many other countries also built forts at Accra during the 17th century. These countries included Sweden, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom and Denmark.\nThe location that is Accra today grew into a large town around the original Ga town. As the city grew, the British, Danish and Dutch forts and the small communities that formed around the forts were made added to the city.\nIn 1877, at the end of the second Anglo-Asante War, Accra replaced Cape Coast as the capital of the British Gold Coast colony. After a railroad was built between Accra and the inland locations of mines and farms, Accra became the economic center of Ghana. Large areas of the city were destroyed by earthquakes in 1862 and 1939, but the city rebuilt around a seaport and later a brewery. Each time it rebuilt, the city was made larger.\nThe Accra Riots in 1948 started people in Ghana fighting for independence. This led to the Ghana's independence from the United Kingdom and it becoming a country in 1957.\nToday, Accra is one of the richest and most modern cities in the African continent. It has a high quality of living by African standards."}

He was one of the great musicians of his time. He was organist at the church of Sainte Clotilde in Paris for more than 30 years, and he taught many talented young musicians. Most of the music for which he is famous was composed when he was already quite old.\nLife.\nC\u00e9sar Franck was born in Li\u00e8ge, a town which is now in Belgium. His father came from near the German-Belgian border and his mother was German. Because his father wanted him to be a concert pianist, he was sent to study at the conservatoire in Liege before going to the Paris Conservatoire in 1837. In 1842 his father made him come back to Li\u00e8ge so that he could practise for his career as a virtuoso pianist. He went back to Paris in 1844 and stayed there for the rest of his life. He told his father he did not want to be a concert pianist. This made his father very angry.\nDuring his first years in Paris, Franck made his living by teaching and playing the organ. In 1848 he married. His parents came to the wedding although they were still angry with him for not wanting to be a pianist.\nIn 1858 he became organist at a new church called Saint Clotilde Basilica. He stayed there for the rest of his life. He decided to improve his organ playing, in particular in the use of pedals and in improvisation. At that time changes were being made in France to the pipe organ. Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll was a very famous organ builder. He built an organ for Saint Clotilde Basilica and Franck gave the first recital on the new instrument in December 1859. Franck became famous for the way he improvised on the organ after the services. However, for many years he did not compose much.\nFranck was becoming known as a teacher of organ and composition. His group of pupils became known as the \"bande \u00e0 Franck\" (the \"Franck band\"). They included Henri Duparc, who introduced him to Alexis de Castillon. Franck became organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire. The students he taught included Vincent d'Indy, Ernest Chausson, and Louis Vierne. His organ works, especially the \"Grande Pi\u00e8ce Symphonique\", were some of the best organ pieces to come from France (or anywhere else) in over a century. They helped to prepare for the French symphonic organ style, which was to include many famous composers from the late 19th century onwards: people such as Vierne, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupr\u00e9.\nIn 1872 he wrote an oratorio \"R\u00e9demption\". It was not a success when it was first performed, but this was mainly due to the instrumental parts which had been badly copied, and by the famous conductor Edouard Colonne who conducted it very badly. The work became popular years later after Franck had died.\nFranck was now starting to compose the works which made him really famous. He wrote a very large oratorio called \"Les B\u00e9atitudes\". Later he wrote a \"Piano Quintet\" and the symphonic poems \"Le chasseur maudit\" and \"Les Djinns\". His piano music included \"Pr\u00e9lude, choral et fugue\" and the \"Variations symphoniques\". In 1885 he was awarded the cross of the Legion d\u2019honneur. A year later he became president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique. He wrote a \"Violin Sonata\" (1886) and a \"Symphony\" (1888), which are probably his two most famous compositions now.\nIn 1890, Franck was knocked down by a horse tram while crossing the road. He died shortly afterwards, although he still managed to compose his \"Trois chorals\" for organ just before he died.\nHis music.\nMany of Franck's works use \"cyclic form\", a way of making a long work with several movements sound like one piece by making the main theme or themes come back in later movements. He wrote in a Romantic style which was partly influenced by the music of Wagner and Liszt. Franck had big hands and when he wrote for the piano he often made the pianist play chords with very wide stretches.\nHe remains famous for just a small number of compositions written in his last years. One of his best known shorter pieces is the motet \"Panis Angelicus\", which was originally written for tenor solo, but is more often heard sung by a soprano or treble."}

It is over the Earth's iron-rich core, which takes up about 15% of Earth's volume.\nThe upper mantle.\nPast episodes of melting and volcanism at the outer levels of the mantle have produced a very thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface, where we live. The gases evolved during the melting of Earth's mantle have a large effect on the composition and size of Earth's atmosphere. \nUppermost mantle.\nA thin crust, the lower part of the lithosphere, surrounds the mantle and is about 5 to 75\u00a0km thick. There are two main zones in the upper mantle. The uppermost mantle plus overlying crust are relatively rigid and form the lithosphere, an irregular layer with a maximum thickness of perhaps 200\u00a0km, of which the uppermost mantle is 120 to 50\u00a0km thick.\nAsthenosphere.\nBelow the lithosphere the upper mantle becomes notably more plastic. It is called the asthenosphere, and is composed of flowing rock in the state of plasticity, about 200\u00a0km thick. \nLower mantle.\nThe lower mantle is much thicker than the upper mantle. It is made of magma, under great pressure, and so is thicker (higher viscosity) and flows less easily. The lower mantles temperature has a max of about 4,000 \u00b0C (7,000 \u00b0F). \nThe chemical composition of the mantle is heavily biased towards three elements: oxygen 44.8% by weight; magnesium 22.8%; silicon 21.5%. Compounds are oxides: silica SiO2 46%; magnesium oxide MgO 37.8%.\nPlace with no crust.\nIn 2007 a team of scientists on board the RRS James Cook went to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle has no crust covering. The anomaly is mid-way between the Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean in the Atlantic Ocean, at or near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is about three kilometres under the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres.\nOther such 'Oceanic Core Complexes' (OCCs) were found later. Many have active hydrothermal vents."}

The storm made landfall in Louisiana as a tropical storm on September 26. Isidore fell apart again and was last seen on September 27 before it went into a frontal zone in Pennsylvania. Isidore left $1.3 billion in damage and 22 deaths. No one knows the damage in Cuba.\nTropical Storm Josephine.\nTropical Storm Josephine was a weak tropical storm that formed on September 17 as Tropical Depression Eleven. It became a tropical storm later on before it died only two days later, which was September 19. Josephine did not cause damage or kill anyone.\nHurricane Kyle.\nHurricane Kyle lasted more than 3 weeks. Hurricane Kyle started as a Subtropical Depression on September 20. It became a subtropical storm, then a tropical storm, and after that, a hurricane. It weakened back to a tropical storm and down to a tropical depression. It became a tropical storm again and made a landfall in McClellanville, South Carolina. Kyle made its second and last landfall in Long Beach, North Carolina on the same day. Kyle left only $5 million in damage and killed only 1 person.\nHurricane Lili.\nHurricane Lili formed on September 21 as Tropical Depression Thirteen. It became a tropical storm on September 23, then it became a tropical wave on September and was not a tropical storm anymore. It reformed and became a tropical depression on September 28. Lili became a tropical storm again and a hurricane on September 30. Lili later made landfall in Cuba and Louisiana. Lili left almost $1 billion in damage and killed 15 people.\nTropical Depression Fourteen.\nTropical Depression Fourteen formed from a tropical wave on October 14. It had maximum wind speeds of 35\u00a0mph, and a minimum pressure of 1002 mbar. For most of the time, it was predicted to become a tropical storm, and to go up through the Bahamas. However, strong wind shear from the northeast did not allow development, and after making landfall in southern Cuba on October 16, it was destroyed by a cold front. Although it created heavy rains, there was no damage.\nStorm names.\nThis is the list of names that were set aside for the Atlantic in 2002. Names that were not used are marked in .\nRetirement.\nAfter the season the names Isidore and Lili were retired. In 2008 Ike and Laura were used instead."}

They were the main organisms in the stromatolites of the Archaean and Proterozoic eons.\nThe ability of cyanobacteria to perform oxygenic photosynthesis is highly significant. The early atmosphere on Earth was largely reducing, that is, without oxygen. The cyanobacteria in stromatolites were the first known organisms to photosynthesise and produce free oxygen. After about a billion years, the effect of this photosynthesis began a huge change in the atmosphere. The process, called the Great Oxygenation Event, took a long time. Eventually, it killed off most of the organisms which could not live in oxygen, and led to the kinds of environment we know today, where most organisms use and need oxygen.\nLight detection.\nCyanobacteria have a way of detecting light.

It is a Salamander (Urodela or Caudata). The alpine newt is one of five newts in Germany.\nDescription.\nEarly in the year, alpine newts mate. During that time, the males have a blue color on their sides but not too much to overlap their white-black-spotted flank. Their belly is a bright orange.\nThe females are more camouflaged to their marshy environment. They are a mottled brown with barely visible, black spots.\nThe biggest of the males can reach up to nine, and the females up to twelve centimeters in length. After the mating season, they return to their natural color of the mottled brown.\nLife and habitat.\nThe alpine newt typically lives in forests with good access to water in hilly to mountainous regions. They are mostly absent in forest-poor areas. They often occur in thick deciduous forests, as well as parland and natural gardens. Outside the spawning season, the Alpine Newt is a land animal. During the day it stays in all kinds of undergrowth, but during the mating season in cool water (forest pools, artificial pools). After the adults come out of winter dormancy, the alpine newts immediately take themselves to the spawning pools.\nLocation.\nThe spread of the alpine newt is constricted to Central Europe and parts of mountainous Southern Europe as well as an isolated area on the Iberian Peninsula.\nThere is also some introduced wild populations in the UK\nEndangerment.\nAfter a steep decrease in the alpine newt population in the 1960s-70s, they have recovered their numbers a bit. Surveillance in the surrounding area of Cologne (approximately 50m above sea level) showed an increase in alpine newt numbers, but the numbers of newts in breeding pools seemed to decline. In home gardens, newts are settling in pools in which there may be a high reproduction rate. If fish are in these ponds, the population will be completely wiped out. However, a small pool of 150 litres volume had more than 60 alpine newt tadpoles of different sizes at the beginning of July 2003. They were likely spawned from just one female.\nTaxonomy.\nThe alpine newt has been usually placed into the \"Triturus\" genus. Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds | display-authors = etal split the genus Triturus into three, and placed the alpine newt into its own genus \"Mesotriton\". Also the subspecies \"T. a. inexpectatus\" was elevated to species status. However this split has not been completely accepted yet. Originally 9 subspecies of the alpine newt were recognized."}

Differential equations are special because the solution of a differential equation is itself a function instead of a number.\nIn applications of mathematics, problems often arise in which the dependence of one parameter on another is unknown, but it is possible to write an expression for the rate of change of one parameter relative to another (derivative). In this case, the problem is reduced to finding a function by its derivative related to some other expressions.\nTypes of Differential Equations.\nIf a differential equation only involves x and its derivative, the rate at which x changes, then it is called a first order differential equation. A higher-order differential equation has derivatives of other derivatives. If there are more variables than just x and y, then it is said to be a partial differential equation. Sometimes, something in the world will obey several differential equations at the same time. These are said to be modeled by coupled differential equations.\nSome differential equations can be solved exactly, and some cannot. Sometimes one can only be estimated, and a computer program can do this very fast. Although they may seem overly-complicated to someone who has not studied differential equations before, the people who use differential equations tell us that they would not be able to figure important things out without them. Most scientists and engineers (as well as mathematicians) take at least one course in differential equations while in college. Some mathematicians devote their career to investigating differential equations that are difficult to solve.\nUses.\nDifferential equations are used in many fields of science since they describe real things:"}

The season officially started on June 1, 1982, and ended on November 30, 1982. Six named storms formed during the season, along with 2 hurricanes.\nWhile most of the storms were usually weak, the most deadliest storm of the season was Tropical Storm Beryl which killed 115 people while moving across the Caribbean Sea.\nStorms.\nHurricane Alberto.\nA tropical depression formed off western Cuba on June 1 from an group of organized thunderstorms. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto travelled usually northeast on an unpredictable course and for a hort time, strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane, one of the earliest hurricanes of June. Alberto then quickly weakened back into a tropical storm, moved back to the west, and died near the Florida Keys, Florida, on June 6.\nThough the storm never made landfall, Alberto killed 23 people in Cuba from heavy flooding. Southern Florida saw fair rainfall, with a maximum of 16.47 inches occurring in Tavernier.\nSubtropical Storm One.\nThe first subtropical storm of the season formed in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on June 18, and took an almost straight path to the northeast for its whole life. It crossed the Florida peninsula that night, causing an issue of several severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. The storm continued, crossing the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and kept its strength until June 20 when it became extratropical near Newfoundland.\nSubtropical Storm One caused three deaths in Florida, sank a fishing ship off the coast of North Carolina, and caused $10 million in damage (1982 USD, $20 million 2005 USD).\nTropical Storm Beryl.\nBeryl became a tropical storm on August 28 while southeast of the Cape Verde islands. The tropical storm travelled slowly west-northwest, while once coming close to hurricane strength. While midway across the Atlantic on September 2, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued west until its circulation collapsed on September 6, just north of the Windward Islands. Beryl killed 115 people in the Cape Verde islands. Though the Cape Verde islands are usually not affected by hurricanes, another tropical storm, Fran, hit the islands in 1984, killing 31 people.\nTropical Storm Chris.\nA non-tropical low formed on September 8 in the Gulf of Mexico. It moved west, and the next day it became into a subtropical depression. Under the control of another low pressure system, the depression turned north, and after slowly becoming better organized it strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris on September 10. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) before moving onto land near Sabine Pass in Louisiana. Chris continued to move inland until it died over central Arkansas on September 13.\nJust before Chris made landfall, as many as 6,500 people moved out from southern Louisiana, while many oil workers moved inland. Chris caused a total of $2 million (1982 USD) in damages.\nHurricane Debby.\nDebby began as a tropical wave that collapsed shortly after leaving the coast of Africa. The wave travelled across the Atlantic, and became a tropical depression off the northern coast of Haiti on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. Hurricane Debby moved north-northeast, affecting Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds. It continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking at 135\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h). Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race in Newfoundland when Debby passed by on September 18. The storm began to speed up and weaken over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby combined itself with a strong non-tropical system over the British Isles on September 20.\nThe tropical disturbance that eventually formed Debby dropped heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 12.86 inches in the southwestern part of the island. Debby was known to cause only minor damages that was related to the storm.\nTropical Storm Ernesto.\nA tropical wave formed off the coast of Africa on September 23. The westeren part of the wave grew bigger and was called Tropical Depression Six on September 30. The depression strengthened, and made a sharp turn on October 1. An Air Force plane found 40 mph winds with a pressure of 1003 mbar and the depression was given the name Ernesto. A second Air Force plane on October 2 found 70 mph winds with a pressure of 997 mbar. By October 3, Ernesto was no longer recognized after combining itself with an extratropical low. Ernesto never came near land and caused no damages."}

Muffins can also have extra ingredients to its flavour, such as blueberries or chocolate chips. Muffins are usually eaten at breakfast but can be eaten at any other meal. It is usually served with tea."}

They are often baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. Like larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations, such as sprinkles, are common on cupcakes. They are often sweet and include frosting. Some specialized bakeries sell only cupcakes.\nHistory.\nThe first cupcake could be traced back to 1796. A recipe for \"a cake to be baked in small cups\" was written in \"American Cookery\" by Amelia Simmons. The earliest use of the term \"cupcake\" was in \u201cSeventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats\u201d in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's \"Recipes\" cookbook.\nIn the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the name \"cup cake\" or \"cupcake\". Before muffin tins were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, ramekins, or molds. They got their name from the cups they were baked in. The name \"fairy cake\" is a description of its size. It would be appropriate for a party of small fairies to share a fairy cake. English \"fairy cakes\" vary in size more than American cupcakes. They are normally smaller and are rarely topped with much icing.\nThe other kind of \"cup cake\" referred to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume. They were measured using a standard-sized cup instead of being weighed. Recipes with ingredients that were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups. They were more commonly baked in tins. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was more used in home kitchens, these recipes became known as \"1234 cakes\" or \"quarter cakes\". They were called this because they are made up of four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs. They are plain yellow cakes that are less rich and less expensive than pound cake. This is because they use about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake. The names of these two major classes of cakes were to tell the baker whether to measure by volume or weight."}

Wounded by a Hollow she was hunting, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo so that he may fight in her stead while she recovers her strength in an artificial human body. Ichigo balances the demands of his substitute Soul Reaper duties and high school while gaining allies in his classmate Orihime Inoue, Yasutora \"Chad\" Sado, and Uryu Ishida of the Quincies.\nWhen Rukia is arrested by her Soul Reaper superiors and sentenced to death, Ichigo and his friends travel to the Soul Society with the help of ex-Soul Reaper scientist Kisuke Urahara, who allows Ichigo to access his own Soul Reaper powers. Conflict unfolds in the Soul Society as Ichigo's group fight through the 13 Court Squads save Rukia, only to learn that everyone have been manipulated by Squad Five captain Sosuke Aizen who faked his death to cause disorder within the Soul Reapers. Aizen reveals himself to masterminded Rukia's capture to acquire Kisuke's desire-granting invention, the Hogyoku, before he and his fellow conspirators escape into the Hollows' realm of Hueco Mundo. Afterwards, Ichigo is accepted by the Soul Reapers and is made an official substitute Soul Reaper.\nIchigo and friends soon enter into escalating skirmishes with Aizen's army of humanoid Hollows, the Arrancars, while joined by the Vizards\u2014Soul Reapers who were victims of Aizen's experiments in creating Soul Reaper/Hollow hybrids. When Orihime is kidnapped by Ulquiorra Cifer of the Espadas, Aizen's 10 most powerful Arrancars, Ichigo and his allies mount a rescue operation that turned out to be a distraction as Aizen's forces appear in Karakura Town with intent of sacrifice the residents to create a key as part of Aizen's plan to reach and assassinate the Soul King who reigns over the Soul Society. As the Vizards join the Soul Reapers defending the town, Aizen's conspirator Gin Ichimaru reals his true colors and attempts to kill Aizen. But Aizen uses Hogyoku to become a Hollow-like being, killing Gin while overpowering everyone. Ichigo ultimately subdues Aizen at the cost of his powers and reverts to a normal human. Months later, Ichigo prepares for life after high school when he is approached by Xcution, a gang of Fullbringers like Chad, who exploit him and his love ones to siphon his own Fullbring abilities. When Soul Society allies restore his Soul Reaper powers, Ichigo resolves to fight with them despite learning their apparent distrust when Xcution's leader Ginjo Kujo is revealed to be his predecessor.\nLater, Ichigo faces an army of Quincies known as the Wandenreich who serve under their people's progenitor Yhwach, who declares war on the Soul Society with ever intent of eliminating the Soul King and dispute the balance of life and dead. Ichigo, learning the full story of himself being a Visard with both Fullbring and Quincy powers, defeats Yhwach in an epic battle with aid from Uryu and his father. Years later, Rukia and Ichigo have their own children, Ichika Abarai and Kazui Kurosaki, who are also Soul Reapers."}

The story is about Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal who moves to Miami, Florida and creates his own cocaine business. It is a loose remake of the 1932 movie \"Scarface\". The movie made $85 million.\nStory.\nTony Montana is a prisoner from Cuba who is coming to the United States on a boat to escape the oppressive Communist government. Once there, he works for Frank Lopez, a Miami drug lord.\nSoon, Tony kills Frank and takes over his business. He also marries Elvira, Frank's girlfriend who at first refused to go out with Tony because of Frank. Soon, Tony becomes very rich and powerful because of his growing cocaine empire. He meets Alexander Sosa, a powerful Bolivian drug lord. Elvira later leaves Tony because she feels that despite all of their money and power, Tony's criminal lifestyle and drug problems make them losers.\nTony is eventually arrested for not paying taxes and even though he would be able to bribe some of the judges, he will still have to go to jail for three years. Sosa offers to have one of his contacts in the Justice Department write off Tony's charges if Tony kills a journalist who is going to make a speech against Sosa to the United Nations. Tony plants a bomb on the target's car, but sees the journalist's family inside it, and does not make the bomb go off. Tony later visits his best friend, Manny, but when he sees his sister, Gina, with him, he kills him. Gina reveals that she and Manny got married a few days earlier and wanted to surprise Tony. Tony, feeling extreme guilt for killing his friend and ruining his sister's life, withdraws to his mansion and begins to snort large amounts of cocaine. Sosa gets angry and sends many men to Miami to kill Tony. When the men enter Tony's mansion, they kill Gina and most of his men. Angry and sad at the death of his sister, Tony singlehandedly kills many of Sosa's men in a major shootout. Tony is then shot in the back by an assassin with a shotgun, and falls into his fountain below, dead."}

{"id": "61157", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61157", "title": "Ecstasy (drug)", "text": "MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), also known as Ecstasy (abbreviated E, X, or XTC), molly (U.S.), or mandy (U.K.), is a psychoactive drug with stimulant and psychedelic effects that is primarily used as a recreational drug. Drugs sold under the street names ecstasy, molly, or mandy are often advertised as pure MDMA, but are often mixed with multiple other drugs. MDMA can cause feelings of euphoria (extreme happiness) and altered sensations. Bad side effects include insomnia, nausea, rapid heartbeat, and addiction. It causes an initial increase in neurotransmitters that is followed by a short-term drop in neurotransmitters, which can lead to severe depression after coming down from the high.\nMDMA is illegal in most countries. Possessing, making or selling it could result in criminal prosecution and a possible prison term. Some countries, such as the U.S., have made limited exceptions to these laws for research. There have been some initial studies on whether it can help patients with severe PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) make progress in therapy if they take very low doses of MDMA immediately before appointments (under medical supervision). , MDMA has no accepted medical uses. The use of MDMA has become more widespread in recent years. Among teens surveyed in 2018, more than 4% of 12th graders in the U.S. reported using ecstasy at some point in their lives. Even some very young teens are experimenting with the drug. More than 1.5% of 8th graders reported ever having used the drug.\nMany ecstasy tablets, especially those sold online on the \u201cdark net\u201d are more potent than ever before, as well. According to one European study, while tablets in the 90s and early 2000s average about 50-80 mg, the average dose of an ecstasy tablet on the current market is now 125 mg. Some \u201csuper pills\u201d have been marketed, with doses ranging between 270 and 340 mg.\nEffects on health.\nMDMA has many effects on the human body and brain. It makes the brain release the chemicals serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. During MDMA use the body also makes more of the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin.\nAll these effects together can make MDMA dangerous to use. The change in body temperature and the tendency to dance for hours on end can make users dehydrate if not enough water is drunk during this time (an example of dehydration and hyperthermia). Lots of dancing can also put pressure on the heart. People with existing heart conditions are vulnerable to these negative side effects.\nAround 7 people die out of every million that use MDMA. Mostly this is due to overheating and dehydration. However, it is possible to drink too much water, swelling the brain and causing death. Many people have died from this after taking MDMA. Another factor is the hormone vasopressin, which is released during MDMA use. Vasopressin restricts the body's urge to urinate, which helps to get rid of excess liquid in the body before it becomes a problem.\nNo current legal use.\nEcstasy is illegal in most, if not all, countries. In the United States, it is classified as a \"Schedule I\" drug. Schedule I drugs have no official medical use and are highly addictive. Some scientists believe Ecstasy may be useful in therapy since it has been found to reduce fear in some individuals. Recently, there has been some research on if it can help people with severe PTSD confront painful memories during therapy appointments. It may also have potential to help people diagnosed with cancer manage their anxiety about death."}

It is only used for storms that are stronger than \"tropical storms\", and become actual hurricanes. The categories into which the scale separates hurricanes are noted by the strength of their maximum sustained wind speeds. The classifications are used mainly to predict the possible wind damage a hurricane will create when it makes landfall. It does not measure rainfall or storm surge or how wide the storm is.\nThe scale is also used to classify subtropical cyclones after a change in the rules made by the National Hurricane Center in 2002.\nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is used only to describe hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean, to the east of the International Date Line. Other areas call their tropical storms by other names, and use their own classification scales.\nExamples.\nCategory 1.\nDangerous winds will produce some damage\nCategory\u00a01 storms may damage roofs, shingles, vinyl sidings, and gutters to well-constructed frame homes. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.\nHurricanes that peaked at Category\u00a01 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Agnes (1972), Juan (1985), Ismael (1995), Danny (1997), Claudette (2003), Gaston (2004), Stan (2005), Humberto (2007), Isaac (2012), Manuel (2013), Earl (2016), Hermine (2016), Nate (2017), Barry (2019), Lorena (2019), Hanna (2020), Isaias (2020), and Nana (2020).\nCategory 2.\nExtremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage\nCategory\u00a02 storms may produce extremely dangerous winds that will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks.\nHurricanes that peaked at Category\u00a02 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Able (1952), Alice (1954), Ella (1958), Fifi (1974), Diana (1990), Gert (1993), Rosa (1994), Erin (1995), Alma (1996), Juan (2003), Alex (2010), Richard (2010), Tomas (2010), Carlotta (2012), Ernesto (2012), Arthur (2014), Sally (2020), and Zeta (2020).\nCategory 3.\nDevastating damage will occur\nTropical cyclones of Category\u00a03 and higher are major hurricanes, and devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.\nHurricanes that peaked at Category\u00a03 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Easy (1950), Carol (1954), Hilda (1955), Audrey (1957), Celia (1970), Ella (1970), Caroline (1975), Eloise (1975), Olivia (1975), Alicia (1983), Elena (1985), Roxanne (1995), Fran (1996), Isidore (2002), Jeanne (2004), Lane (2006), Karl (2010), and Otto (2016).\nCategory 4.\nCatastrophic damage will occur\nCategory\u00a04 storms may cause catastrophic damage. Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\nThe 1900 Galveston hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster (at the time) to hit the United States, peaked at an intensity that corresponds to a modern-day Category\u00a04 storm. Other examples of storms that peaked at Category\u00a04 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Donna (1960), Flora (1963), Cleo (1964), Betsy (1965), Carmen (1974), Frederic (1979), Joan (1988), Iniki (1992), Luis (1995), Iris (2001), Charley (2004), Dennis (2005), Gustav (2008), Ike (2008), Joaquin (2015), Harvey (2017), Laura (2020), and Eta (2020).\nCategory 5.\nNear-total damage will occur\nCategory\u00a05 is the highest category of the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. These storms cause roofs to break apart on many buildings, and some building may break apart, with small utility buildings blown over or away. Collapse of many roofs and walls, especially those with no inside supports, is common. Very heavy and unfixable damage to many wooden buildings and total destruction to mobile/manufactured homes is common. Only a few types of buildings can survive, and only if located at least inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of concrete or steel frame construction, multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either lots of brick or concrete/cement block and have roofs with slopes of no less than 35\u00a0degrees from a horizontal angle and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters. Unless most of these requirements are met, the catastrophic destruction of a structure may occur.\nThe storm's flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline, and many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked, isolating most affected communities. Massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas. Total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected, possibly for up to several months.\nHistorical examples of storms that made landfall at Category\u00a05 status include: \"Cuba\" (1924), \"Okeechobee\" (1928), \"Bahamas\" (1932), \"Cuba\u2013Brownsville\" (1933), \"Labor Day\" (1935), Janet (1955), Camille (1969), Edith (1971), Anita (1977), David (1979), Gilbert (1988), Andrew (1992), Dean (2007), Felix (2007), Irma (2017), Maria (2017), Michael (2018), and Dorian (2019). No Category\u00a05 hurricane is known to have made landfall at that strength in the eastern Pacific basin."}

They have scales on their skin. They are the only mammals which have this adaptation.\nThere are three genera of pangolin, all of which eat ants and termites. They catch their food using their tongues, and they do not eat anything else.\nThese scaled mammals are considered one of the most threatened animal among the mammal species. Unfortunately we know very little of their known status, such as their distribution across West African countries. Only evidence of the white bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis) was found. No evidence of the Giant Pangolin (Smutsia gigantic) was found leading to believe that the giant pangolin no longer appears in West Africa.\nPangolins have features of armadillos (long, ant eating tongue and broad tail) and sloths (claws), but the pangolin is in a completely different order. The pangolin belongs to the order Pholidota.\nPangolins have large, hardened, overlapping plate-like scales. The pangolin scales are made of keratin. and are attached to muscles under the skin. and can be moved to point towards predators. Hair grows between the scales and near the rear of the animal.\nThe pangolin's scaled body is a bit like a pine cone or globe artichoke. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting like armour while it tucks its face under its tail. The scales are sharp, providing extra defence from predators.\nA pangolin's main predators are wild cats, hyenas and humans.\nA mother pangolin's gestation period is between 120 and 180 days. Young pangolin are born with scales, and they harden by the second day the pangopup is out of the womb.\nWhen walking on a level surface the pangolin is bipedal. It walks on the back legs. Its body is held horizontal, and is balanced by its heavy tail at the back.\nSometimes pangolins are smuggled into China on the black market. Their scales are used as an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine.\nPangolins are a critically endangered species and have been hunted and trafficked all across Asia and Africa. They are usually sought after for their scales, meat and medical properties. This creature also has been identified as a host for SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses."}

Instead, the general manager of the Panthers, Mike Keenan, sent him to the Vancouver Canucks, along with Lukas Krajicek, in return for Todd Bertuzzi, Alex Auld, and Bryan Allen. Luongo first said that he was sad because he was leaving so suddenly and Vancouver was very far away.\nIn the 2007 season, Luongo was in Vancouver. He was voted into the All-Star Game as the starting goaltender. The Canucks went to the playoffs. It was Luongo's first time to reach the playoffs. In one game, against the Dallas Stars, he made around 70 saves, which is very close to breaking records.\nOn March 4, 2014, a day before the NHL trade deadline, the Canucks traded Luongo along with prospect Steven Anthony to the Florida Panthers for goaltender Jacob Markstr\u00f6m and centre Shawn Matthias. Luongo's salary will still be retained by the Canucks."}

The Internet Archive was founded by Brewster Kahle in 1996.\nThis archive includes \"snapshots of the World Wide Web\" (archived copies of pages, taken at various points in time), software, movies, books, and audio recordings. To make the books available on the Internet, they are first placed into special scanning machines by volunteers and employees of the library. These machines take very high quality pictures of the books' pages, and then images and text of the books are freely available on the Website. This process is called \"digitization\". The old collections of films and sound are digitized in this way too before being made available online. All of the original books, movies, records and so on are stored in a giant warehouse in California, just like normal libraries store their smaller collections of books or other records. This collection is called the Open Library and aims to create \"one web page for every book ever published.\" It was created by computer programmer and activist, Aaron Swartz.\nThe Archive also purchases new electronic books and loans them out to readers just like any other normal library. These electronic books can be read by viewing the Website, on the reader's own computer or electronic reading device, and even in special reading areas inside the Archive where the tables have touchscreens and computers built into them.\nTo ensure the stability and endurance of the archive, The Internet Archive is mirrored at Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt, the only library in the world with a mirror. The Internet Archive makes the collections available at no cost to researchers, historians, and scholars. The Internet Archive is a member of the American Library Association and is officially recognized by the State of California as a library."}

The term is also used for the location in which these records are kept. Archives are made up of records which have been created during the course of an individual or organization's life. In general, an archive consists of records which have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation. Records, which may be in any media, are normally unpublished, unlike books and other publications. Archives may also be generated by large organisations such as corporations and governments. Archives are different from libraries in that archives hold records which are unique. Archives can be described as holding information \"by-products\" of activities, while libraries hold specifically authored information \"products\". The word 'archives' is the correct terminology, whereas 'archive' as a noun or a verb is related to computer science.\nA person who works in archives is called an archivist.

This is similar to \"My-HiME\", as \"My-Otome\" has the same characters, but even they have different personalities.\nStory.\nIn the future, people live in planet Earl. Machines called nanomachines still keep the technology from the past. Nanomachines are used to give power to Otomes (Girls), who train in a school called Garderobe academy. The Garderobe academy train Otomes to become Meister Otomes (Dancing Star Girls), who protect their Masters - usually royal people of different kingdoms in Earl.\nA woman called Rena Searrs is an Otome, who had lost her powers because of having a baby. She fights to protect her Master, a king from Windbloom, and hangs her necklace to the daughter of the king, floating her away in a casket at a river.\n14 years later, Arika Yumemiya goes to Garderobe to become an Otome like her mother, who she does not know very much about. She enters the school and when she finds many things which disturb her from being an Otome because of her past, she tries to bear it with her cheerfulness. This story is about how Arika will begin to understand the meaning of being an Otome and how she will save the world from the legendary Harmonium's power.\nMy-Otome terms.\nThis is the list of My-Otome's fictional words or phrases.\nOtome.\nOtomes (Girls) are powerful girls of Earl, a future planet. Otomes are given money for 100 soldiers, because they are as strong as 100 soldiers put together. They train in a school called Garderobe, and when they graduate, they become Meisters (Dancing Star Girls). Otomes can only materialise when their master kisses their earring.\nOtomes can also become one of the Five Pillars, who do not need masters to materialise.\nMaster.\nWhen a royal person makes a contract with an otome, he or she becomes the master of the otome. Otomes can only materialise if the Master kisses them. The Master has to share a life with his or her otome, so when the otome dies, the Master dies, and when the Master dies, the otome dies.\nFive Pillars.\nThe Five Pillars are the five otomes who use the Shinsou, so they do not need a master.\nShinsou.\nThe Shinsou is a source who makes the Five Pillars materialise. There is only one Shinsou.\nNanomachine.\nA Nanomachine is a machine from the past which puts a Robe inside the otomes' bodies, so that the Robe shows when they materialise. An earring connects to the Nanomachines. But the Nanomachine has a weakness to males semen. This means that if an otome has sex with a male she will not be able to materialise any more, and will stop becoming otomes, because she lost her power.\nWhen a Master kisses an otome's earring, the otome can materialise because the Nanomachine absorbs the heat from the Master's lips, absorbing the Master's power. This is why a Master must share a life with the otome.\nNano means small, so Nanomachine means a machine which puts things into the body's small cells.\nGem.\nA gem is a jewel which the Master and otome can use to make a contract with each other. There are two same gems: one for the Master on his or her ring and one for the otome, for her earring. From then on, the earring on the otomes are kissed by their Masters to materialise. Stronger Otome's can also kiss there gem to give them permission to Materialise.\n\"Material\" means an object, and \"materialise\" means that a hidden object has shown itself. In My-Otome, materialising is when the Robe (Combat Suit) inside the Otomes are released, so that they can fight.\nSlave Monster.\nA Slave Monster is an evil robot which is controlled by a Slave Master.\nSlave Master.\nLike a Master, a Slave Master shares a life with its protector. Instead of otomes, they have a Slave Monster and they do not need a contract to materialise them, as Slave Monsters do not materialise. The Slave Master has to call the Slave Monster by using the Slave Crystal and give a pledge to the God of Wisdom, that they believe in his wisdom, and to call out a loyal slave for them. A Slave Master must always listen to the Slave leader, who is John Smith in My-Otome.\nSlave Crystal.\nA Slave Crystal is a diamond-shaped crystal. To call out a Slave Monster, a Slave Master must put blood into the crystal by pushing his or her thumb to the crystal and pledging.\nHarmonium.\nA harmonium is a musical instrument which opens up only for a protector, creator or a sword. Inside is a piano which can only be played when all the three conditions stepped onto its staircase. The piano makes the players have anything they desire or want to have."}

They are also known as 'fish hawk', 'sea hawk', and 'fish eagle'. It is a large bird measuring up to 60 cm (24 in) long from beak to tail. It has dark brown wings.\nDescription.\nThe osprey weighs 1.4\u20132 kg (3.0\u20134.4 lb) and is 52\u201360 cm (20\u201324 in) long with a 150\u2013180 cm (5\u20136 ft) wingspan (the distance between the right wingtip and left wingtip when they are spread out). The back of the bird is brown and the belly is white. The head is white with a dark stripe across the eyes. The eyes are golden to brown and the beak (the mouth of a bird) is black. The legs and feet are white with black talons (nails of a bird). \nThe osprey has a short tail and long, narrow wings. Males and females look similar, but males are often paler. In flight, the osprey raises its wings in an arch shape, making it look like a gull.\nConservation.\nScotland.\nScotland is typical osprey habitat with lots of trees and lakes (called 'lochs'). Because of egg thieves and hunting, only two pairs of ospreys were left there in 1967. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began to protect the nests. Ospreys have returned every year to the protected nest at Loch Garten. More than 1.5 million people have been to see them. \nThe number of ospreys in Scotland has increased a lot, but the population has been slow to spread. This is because ospreys often return to breed near to the place where they hatched. This has been shown in studies in the USA and Sweden."}

It may or may not be goal-directed, aimed at solving specific problems. It is not the only way brains operate. Behaviour may occur as a result of instinct, and the adaptive unconscious may solve problems without a person being aware.\nOther animals can use their brains to solve problems, but there is no way of telling whether they do so consciously. Thought is investigated by four or five academic disciplines, each in its own way. The disciplines include psychology, philosophy, biology, physiology, psychoanalysis and sociology.\nPhilosophy.\nPhilosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, functions, properties, and consciousness. The mind-body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, especially the brain, is a central issue in philosophy of mind.\nThe mind-body problem.\nThe mind-body problem has to do with the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how\u2014or even if\u2014minds are affected by and can affect the body.\nOur perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a hat, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how someone's beliefs and desires can cause that individual's neurons to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of Ren\u00e9 Descartes."}

Stems may point up or down. Different-facing stems indicate the voice for polyphonic music written on the same staff. For single-note melodies, the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If the stem points up from a notehead, the stem starts at the right-hand side of the note, but if it points down, it starts from the left. The exception to this rule is when a chord contains a second, in which case the stem runs between the two notes, the higher being placed on the left of the stem and the lower on the right. The length of a stem is usually that of an octave on the staff, going to either an octave higher or lower than the notehead, depending on which way the stem is pointing.\nProduction.\nStems are the individual parts of a mix, separately saved (usually to disc) for the purposes of use in a remix."}

It is cheaper to study at BYU than at other private universities because most of the cost of attending BYU is paid for by the LDS church.\nBYU has many topics to study. This includes liberal arts, engineering, agriculture, management, physical science and mathematical sciences, nursing, and law. The university is grouped into 11 smaller parts that create their own rules on how to be allowed to study a topic.

It is the most significant breeding place for tropical wading birds in North America. It also has the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western hemisphere. \nIt is also home to more than 350\u00a0species of birds, 300\u00a0species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40\u00a0species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles live within Everglades National Park.\nDiversion and quality of water.\nAll of South Florida's fresh water are kept in the Biscayne Aquifer. They are also recharged in the park. Only less than 50\u00a0percent of the Everglades water remain today. \nBetween the 1940s and 2000s, the number of wading birds has become smaller. It has reached around 90\u00a0percent decrease from their original numbers . \nThe diversion of water to South Florida's still-growing metropolitan areas is the number one threat for the park's inhabitants. \nIn the 1950s and 1960s, of canals and levees, 150\u00a0gates and spillways, and 16\u00a0pumping stations were built to lead water towards the cities and away from the Everglades. Low levels of water leave many fishes vulnerable to reptiles and birds. As sawgrass dry, it can burn or die off. \nAs a result, many apple snails and other animals that wading birds feed upon, are killed. Populations of birds have been dropping. \nIn 2009, the South Florida Water Management District claimed that the number of wading birds across South Florida have increased by 335%. However, despite three years of reported higher numbers, \"The Miami Herald\" discovered the same year that populations of waders in the park decreased by 29%."}

Most episodes showed events in the present combined with stories from a character's past or future. The show was created by J. J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, and Jeffrey Lieber. It was mostly filmed in Oahu, Hawaii. The first episode was shown on September 22, 2004. Since then, a total of six seasons have been shown on television. The series is made by ABC Studios, Bad Robot Productions and Grass Skirt Productions. It plays on the ABC Network in the United States. Other television networks show the series in other countries. Because of its large cast and the cost of filming in Hawaii, the series was one of the most expensive on television.\n\"Lost\" had an average of 15.5 million viewers per episode on ABC during its first year. It won many awards including the Emmy Award for outstanding drama series in 2005 and best American import at the British Academy Television Awards also in 2005.\n\"Lost\" ended with its sixth season. The sixth season began in February 2010 and ended in May 2010.\nStory.\nSeason 1.\nThe episodes of Season 1 were shown on television in the United States starting on September 22, 2004. There were 24 episodes, which were shown on Wednesday nights. After their plane crashes on an island, the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 must work together to stay alive. The survivors find mysterious things including polar bears, an unseen monster, and the other people living on the island, known as the \"Others.\" They also meet a Frenchwoman who has been on the island for 16 years and find a metal hatch (door) buried in the ground. Some of them try to leave the island on a raft.\nSeason 2.\nSeason 2 had 23 episodes and were shown in the United States and Canada on Wednesdays starting September 21, 2005. Most of the story is about the conflict between the survivors and the Others. The survivors go down into the hatch door and find a secret, underground building where a man named Desmond has been living for three years. They learn about the DHARMA Initiative, a group of scientists who built the hatch and many other buildings on the island. The characters meet a new group of survivors from the tail end of the crashed airplane. One of the crash survivors betrays the other castaways by working with the Others.\nSeason 3.\nSeason 3 had 22 episodes that began airing in the United States and Canada on October 4, 2006 on Wednesdays at 9:00 pm. After a break, the show returned on February 7, 2007 and aired at 10:00 pm. The story continues 67 days after the crash. New crash survivors and Others are introduced. The crash survivors learn about the Others and their history on the island. A war between the Others and the survivors begins, and the survivors make contact with a rescue team.\nSeason 4.\nSeason 4 began airing January 31, 2008 and ended on May 29, 2008. When the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike began, only 8 of the planned 16 episodes had been filmed. After the writer's strike was resolved, only 5 of the remaining 8 episodes in season 4 were filmed. In this season, people from a ship called the \"Kahana\" come to the island. The new characters are not really a rescue team, and they put the crash survivors in danger. Later, six of the survivors escape the island. They become famous and are called the \"Oceanic Six.\" The things they do after going back home are shown as \"flashforwards,\" which are scenes showing the future.\nSeason 5.\nSeason 5 was shown in the United States and Canada from January 21, 2009 to May 13, 2009. This season follows two time lines. The first takes place on the island where the remaining survivors time travel through many time periods. The second shows the Oceanic Six trying to return to the island. Later in the season, most of the characters end up on the island in the year 1977. They join up with the DHARMA Initiative, a group of scientists who lived on the island. Some characters return to the island in 2007, where they meet Jacob, the leader of the Others.\nSeason 6.\nSeason 6 aired on February 2, 2010. It was the final season and it had 18 episodes. To keep the story a surprise, the producers of the series do not want any preview scenes to be shown before the season starts.\nCast.\nCurrent.\nThese characters have regular appearances on the show as of the sixth season.\nFormer.\nThese characters were regular characters at one point of the show and are now no longer shown or shown only in flashbacks."}

It is the largest city in the country. The city has a population of 531,763 people. Most of the population of the Central African Republic lives in the western parts of the country, near Bangui.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1889 in what was then the French colony Haut-Oubangui ('Upper Ubangi'). The colony was later renamed Oubangui-Chari and made part of French Equatorial Africa. The city grew around the French military post on the Ubangi river. Bangui served as an administration center for the colony and is now the administrative center of the CAR.\nMuch violence in Bangui came after the March 1981 elections. These elections took place after the French removed Jean-Bedel Bokassa from office and replaced him with David Dacko. People who did not like Dacko attacked Bangui and made Dacko leave the country. Andre Kolingba then formed the Comit\u00e9 Militaire pour le Redressement National.\nAbout 200 Central African Republic soldiers mutinied in Bangui in May 1996. They wanted back pay and for dictator Patass\u00e9 to be removed from control of the country. French soldiers in the country stopped them and returned Patass\u00e9 to power. More than 50 people were killed during this time.\nGeography and Climate.\nBangui is on the northern banks of the Ubangi River. It is just below a series of rapids. The Congolese town of Zongo is on the opposite side of the river from Bangui. The city centre is near the river. It has a large triumphal arch, the Presidential Palace and the central market. North of the city lie rolling hills.\nThe Central African Republic is just north of the Equator. Because of this, the daily high temperatures rarely fall below the high 80s Fahrenheit. The rainy season lasts from May until October. Bangui, being in the south of the country and closest to the Equator, is slightly hotter and wetter than the northern parts of the country.\nEconomy.\nBangui is an administrative, trade, and commercial center. Bangui makes textiles, food products, beer, shoes, and soap. The main exports are cotton, timber, coffee, and sisal. Unemployment in the city was near 23% as of 2001.\nTransportation.\nBangui is a river port. It is served by Bangui M'Poko International Airport. The port handles the most of the country's trade with other countries. River ferries sail to Brazzaville and Zongo. Roads connect the city to Cameroon, Chad, and Sudan.\nCulture.\nSeveral periodicals and three daily newspapers publish in Bangui. Other things to see in Bangui include Boganda Museum and Bokassa Palace.\nEducation.\nBangui is home to the University of Bangui. It was founded in 1970. The University of Bangui is the only non-agricultural college in the Central African Republic."}

{"id": "61515", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61515", "title": "Satoru Iwata", "text": " was a Japanese businessman, video game programmer and gamer. He was the fourth president and CEO of Nintendo. He is widely regarded as someone who helped make video games liked by a wider audience by focusing on making entertaining games rather than advanced hardware.\nOn July 11, 2015, Iwata died of bile duct cancer at age 55. Iwata was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 DICE Awards.\nEarly life.\nIwata was born and raised in Sapporo, Japan on December 6, 1959. His father was a municipal mayor.\nIwata got his first computer, a Commodore PET, in 1978. He took the machine apart, and he studied the machine because he wanted to understand it. The computer had a central processing unit (MOS 6502) similar to the one used by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The NES was a gaming console for which he would later make games.\nIwata expressed interest in the creation of video games early on and during his high school years, began producing electronic games at his home. The several simple number games Iwata produced made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates. Following high school, Iwata was admitted to the Tokyo Institute of Technology, where he majored in computer science. Tomohiko Uematsu, an engineering professor, said Iwata was very good at software programming. He said that Iwata could write programs faster and more better than any of his other students. While attending the school, he did an unpaid internship at Commodore Japan. There, he helped the head engineer\u2014Yash Terakura\u2014with technical and software-development work. One of his main reasons for taking the job was to spend more time around computers and learn details of computers. Terakura would later be a mentor to Iwata. Terakura taught him about hardware engineering. Iwata and some of his friends rented an apartment in Akihabara. They formed a club where they would create and code games. Classmates living in nearby apartments called Iwata's room \"Game Center Iwata\". He would often show his games to the Seibu department store's computer department. By 1980, a group of employees there invited him to join their company, HAL Laboratory, Inc.\nHAL Laboratory.\nWhile attending the school, he worked part-time as a programmer for HAL Laboratory, Inc. HAL became the first company to make a license with Namco for developing games. He joined the company full-time after graduating in 1982. Iwata was its fifth employee and only programmer. Around the same time, Iwata's father was elected mayor of Muroran. Iwata's family did not agree with Iwata's career choice. His father did not talk to him for six months after Iwata joined HAL.\nIwata became the company's coordinator of software production in 1983. While he was coordinator, he helped HAL make a relationship with Nintendo so they would be able to makee games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. He went to Kyoto himself to ask for permission to work on games for the NES. Nintendo said yes. His first published game was \"Joust\" for the NES\u2014a port of the 1982\u00a0arcade game. Other video games he worked on were \"Balloon Fight\", \"NES Open Tournament Golf\", \"EarthBound\", and the \"Kirby\" games. Nintendo contacted other developers to make \"Open Tournament Golf\"; however, all of them did not want to as they did not believe the large amount of data could be kept in an NES cartridge. Iwata said he could develop the game. It was very difficult for Iwata; he had to create his own data compression method in order to fit all 18\u00a0golf courses into the game. HHAL had to make parallax scrolling for \"F-1 Race\" because the NES hardware did not support it.\nBecause Iwata was good at programming, programmers and gamers started respecting him. He would often continue to work on weekends and holidays (Japanese holidays, New Year's Eve-Day, Christmas and Japanese Independence Day) because he wanted to. HAL was about to be bankrupt, so Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in 1993 when Nintendo's then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi, asked him to be promoted. With Nintendo's help, Iwata helped turn the company around from its \u00a51.5\u00a0billion debt and manage its finances. It took about 6 years. Iwata did not have much managing experience. Because of this, Iwata learned how to make himself better. He often read books about managing. He also asked for advice from others.\nAlthough he was not part of Nintendo at the time, Iwata helped with developing \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\" and \"Silver\" by creating compression tools used for graphics in the games. While working as a go-between for Game Freak and Nintendo, he helped program \"Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\" for the Nintendo 64. All he had to do was read the original coding in \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\" and \"Green\" and porting the battle system into the new game in just one week. Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pok\u00e9mon Company, said that Iwata was important in bringing \"Pok\u00e9mon\" to Western markets. While being president of HAL, he created the plan for localization after reviewing the code for \"Red\" and \"Green\". They were released in the West two years after they were released in Japan. He also helped Masahiro Sakurai develop \"Super Smash Bros.\" for the Nintendo 64.\nNintendo.\nEarly years (2000\u201302).\nIn 2000, Iwata became the head of Nintendo's corporate planning division. He was also put on the board of directors. Over the next two years, he wanted to game development cheaper and shorter while making sure the quality was still good. During his first two years at Nintendo, the company saw profit increase 20 and 41\u00a0percent. Iwata's work helped do this. When Yamauchi, the company's president since 1949, retired on May\u00a024, 2002, Iwata became Nintendo's fourth president. He was the first Nintendo president that was not in the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage. Yamauchi asked Iwata for one things: \"that Nintendo have new ideas and create hardware that shows that ideal. And make software that has the same standard.\" Nintendo was a company that wanted individualism, with a policy created by Yamauchi to create new development positions when needed. However, this prevent good collaboration between departments.\nWhen Iwata was promoted, Nintendo was still a profitable company. However, they were not doing as well as other console makers. The GameCube was selling poorly compared to competitors, with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox outselling it. His presidency also happened when online gaming became popular. Nintendo had not started doing online gaming. He was careful about doing it, saying: \"We're not against the idea of going online. We're just practical.\" He also created a relationship between Nintendo and Capcom that helped the GameCube. During an interview in 2002, Iwata said that he felt the gaming industry was becoming too exclusive. He wanted to make hardware and games that all people would want to play rather than focusing on good graphics.\nOne of the first things he did as president was to meet directly with the company's 40\u00a0department heads and 150\u00a0other employees. This was very different from Yamauchi; Yamauchi did not meet with employees often, and he usually had only one speech every year. Iwata was knew that just because he is president, that would not mean everyone would agree with him. He decided to talk to them on a personal level. If employees disagreed with his view, Iwata would suggest they follow their idea instead of his own. He said \"creators only improve themselves if they take risks\". Iwata also brought more data and science into the business part of the company. Yamauchi made decisions using intuition and experience, Iwata had ideas with a lot of data to convince people. Iwata also promoted Miyamoto, Genyo Takeda, Yoshihiro Mori, and Shinji Hatano to representative directors on the company's board of directors. Their positions had the same power as his own.\nRevitalization of the company (2003\u201309).\nFollowing up on his 2002\u00a0interview, Iwata said there was a problem in the gaming market in his keynote speech at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show. During this speech, he thought about the history of the industry and that there was less interest in video games. Starting at the end of the 1990s, were fewer sales in the Japanese market. This continued into the early 2000s. Competition between Nintendo and Sony meant consoles were more focused on powerful hardware. However, the Nintendo 64 was too difficult for developers to make games. Because of this, software was not as good. Iwata asked for an analysis to be done. Nintendo decided that focusing on hardware was not the best way to promote video games. They decided to focus on software. In 2004, there was a big change within Nintendo. Iwata merged various departments created under Yamauchi. He wanted to have collaborative work throughout the company. He later created a \"User Expansion Project\" in 2005. Employees normally not related to game development would give ideas for new games.\nIn a March\u00a02004 interview, Iwata said: \"Games have come to a dead end.\" He said that developers wasted far too much time focusing on core gamers; he said that they would not make a profit if they did not make games for the normal game player. He also wanted to show that Nintendo, a \"conservative\" company, would become a big new creator of entertainment. Iwata created a \"blue ocean\" strategy to help Nintendo compete against the other console makers. Instead of competing against them about powerful hardware, Iwata decided to make interesting and entertaining hardware and games.\nFinancial downturn (2010\u201314).\nThe Nintendo 3DS and Wii U were not as successful as the DS and Wii. Nintendo's finances became worse starting in 2010.\nDeath.\nOn July 11, 2015, Iwata died of bile duct cancer at age 55."}

It was made on May 9; three weeks earlier than when the 2007 season was supposed to start. Andrea started from a non-tropical rain weather area off the coast of Daytona Beach, Florida. After staying close to the same area, on May 10, Andrea weakened into a subtropical depression after coming near to dry air and wind shear, and on the next day, the National Hurricane Center stopped looking at the storm and stopped giving out advisories.\nThe storm made bad surf along the beach areas from Florida to North Carolina. Andrea killed a total of 6 people not in a direct way, and 5 of those deaths happened when Andrea was extratropical before being a subtropical storm.\nAndrea was the first tropical storm to form before the official start of the season since Tropical Storm Ana from the 2003 season which formed on April 2003. The storm was also the first named storm to form in the month of May since Tropical Storm Arlene from the 1981 season.\nStorm history.\nSubtropical Storm Andrea formed out of an area of a kind of strong non-tropical rainy place that slowly moved around the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina. After becoming stronger a bit more and having the National Hurricane Center look at the storm closely, it was named \"Andrea\" on May 9 after the NHC discovered that the system had a closed low-level spinning and looked subtropical.\nThe storm did little more than stay near the same place before it became weak and turned into a subtropical depression after coming in contact with dry air and wind shear, both things which weaken tropical and subtropical cyclones. Andrea then died out off the coast of Florida on May 11 after collapsing because of bad weather conditions for the storm.\nPreparations.\nThe extratropical system that would later be Andrea created high waves that made the National Weather Service give a High Surf Advisory at the coastlines between Florida and North Carolina. Almost right after the NHC called the storm Andrea, it also gave out Tropical Storm Watches to Florida and Georgia's coast. But the NHC those stopped giving out advisories after Andrea weakened into a depression. Also, a gale warning was given out for much of the South Carolina coastline.\nImpact.\nAndrea was known to have killed a total of 6 people, while 5 of the people killed happened before Andrea became a subtropical storm. Also, the storm only made small damages between the Florida and the North Carolina coast."}

It is similar to a force field. The area is created by using magnetism to hold the plasma in place. With current technology, this area of space is quite small. It is in the shape of a flat planes inside a cylinder.\nAs plasma increases in temperature, it becomes thicker. At a high enough temperature, plasma is thick enough to separate a vacuum from normal atmosphere. Plasma does not stop radiation, such as lasers, from moving through it. Because of this, scientists can use a plasma window to create an area of vacuum while still letting radiation to move through it. This is needed because certain types of radiation can only be created in a vacuum, but scientists need to use the radiation on things that are found in a normal atmosphere.\nHistory.\nThe Plasma Window was created at Brookhaven National Laboratory by Ady Hershcovitch. It was patented in 1995. Other creations using the same idea as the plasma window include the Plasma Valve.\nPlasma Valve.\nThe Plasma Valve is related to a plasma window. It was created a year after the plasma window. The plasma Valve is a layer of gas inside a special shell. A ring around the shell holds a vacuum. A breach in the ring can be very bad but technology lets scientists shut off the machine in time before anything happens.\nProperties.\nA plasma window is usually created at temperatures of 15,000 kelvin. The only limit to the window's size is the amount of energy needed to create it. A window needs 20 kW of energy for every inch in size.\nPlasma windows will glow in different colors depending on the gas used to create the plasma."}

Many people just call him Plautus. He was probably born in Sarsina (a city in Emilia-Romagna). His comedies are among the earliest works of Latin literature that has not been lost. He is also one of the earliest writers of musical theater.\nBiography.\nLittle is known about Plautus' early life. When Plautus was young, he built stages for plays. He also helped change the scenes. This might be when he started to love the theatre. People noticed that he was a talented actor. He called himself \"Macchius\" (a clownish character in popular farces), and \"Plautus\" (a term meaning \"flat-footed\"). Tradition also says that after some time, he made enough money to start working in the shipping business. He started something, but he was not successful. He then is said to have worked as someone who worked with his hands. He learned about Greek drama \u2013 particularly the New Comedy of Menander \u2013 in his free time. His studies led to his plays being shown. The plays were first shown between c. 205 BC and 184 BC. Plautus' comedies are mostly adaptations of Greek plays for Roman people. They are usually based on the works of the Greek playwrights.\nPlautus and the Gods of Roman Society.\nH. M. Tolliver talks about the state gods of Rome and what their importance was in the Theatre of Plautus. These gods were an important part of the Romans' lives in Plautus\u2019 time - people were supposed to worship them. Tolliver tells us that the gods were not exactly like the gods worshipped today. They were worshipped but also stood as a national symbol. State religion also served as a political tool. If the gods supported a bad leader, the people should too.\nPlautus is sometimes accused of teaching the public indifference and mockery of the gods. Any character in his plays could be compared to a god. Whether to honour a character or to mock him, these references were demeaning to the gods. These references to the gods include a character comparing a mortal woman to a god, or saying he would rather be loved by a woman than by the gods. Pyrgopolynices from \"Miles Gloriosus\" (vs. 1265), in bragging about his long life, says he was born one day later than Jupiter. In \"Pseudolus,\" Jupiter is compared to Ballio the pimp. It is not uncommon, either, for a character to scorn the gods. This can be seen in \"Poenulus\" and \"Rudens\".\nUsually the only characters that scorn a god are those of low standing, like a pimp. Plautus perhaps does this to further demoralize the characters. Soldiers often bring ridicule among the gods. Young men, meant to represent the upper social class, often make fun of the gods in their remarks. Parasites, pimps, and courtesans often praise the gods with little ceremony. Tolliver argues that drama both reflects and foreshadows social change. It is likely that there was already much skepticism about the gods in Plautus\u2019 time. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but used the ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus\u2019 plays would have been banned, had they been too risky.\nGnaeus Naevius.\nGnaeus Naevius was another Roman playwright of the late third century BC. He wrote tragedies and even founded the fabula praetexta (history plays), in which he dramatized historical events. He fought in the First Punic War and his birth, therefore, is placed around the year 280 B.C.E. His first tragedy took place in 235 B.C.E. Plautus would have been living at the exact time as Naevius, but began writing later. Naevius is most famous for having been imprisoned by the Metelli and the Scipiones \u2013 two powerful families of the late third century. Naevius\u2019 imprisonment and eventual exile is a case of state censorship. This fear of censorship may have influenced Plautus\u2019 choice of what he wrote about and how he wrote about it.\nTypical characters.\nWhile hundreds of plays have been attributed to Plautus' name, the canon consists of 20 surviving plays. To be able to use a more diverse set of characters, he developed what is called a \"stock character\". He sometimes used typical situations where these characters could be used as well. He always used the same kinds of stock characters, especially if he could amuse the audience. As Walter Juniper wrote, \u201cEverything, including artistic characterization and consistency of characterization, were sacrificed to humor, and character portrayal remained only where it was necessary for the success of the plot and humor to have a \"persona\" who stayed in character, and where the \"persona\" by his portrayal contributed to humor.\u201d\nFor example, in \" Miles Gloriosus\", the titular \u201cbraggart soldier\u201d Pyrgopolynices only shows his vain and immodest side in the first act, while the parasite Artotrogus exaggerates Pyrgopolynices\u2019 achievements. Artotrogus creates more and more ludicrous claims that Pyrgopolynices agrees to without question. These two are perfect examples of the stock characters of the pompous soldier and the desperate parasite that appeared in Plautine comedies.\nIn this way, Plautus could greatly simplify complex characters and give the audience what it wanted. \u201cThe audience to whose tastes Plautus catered was not interested in the character play,\u201d instead it wanted humor that was easy to understand by many people. Stock setups offered such humor. Plautus used puns, he played with words, or he gave the words another meaning. Usually, the humorous characters in Plautine plays are of low social standing. This helps the comedy overall, because lower-class characters were often taken less seriously, and had to be less careful what they said."}

As a player, he played almost 600 game and scored over 100 goals. He also played for the England national team. He scored four goals in 20 games for them.\nRobson managed Fulham F.C. and Ipswich Town F.C.. He then managed the England national football team for eight years, from 1982 to 1990. He led England to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 1990. He left England to manage other football teams in Europe. These included clubs from Holland, Portugal and Spain. Robson came back to England to manage Newcastle United F.C. in 1999.\nRobson was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was described as terminal in 2007. He died in 2009.\nEarly life.\nRobson was born in Sacriston, County Durham, England in 1933. He was the fourth of five brothers. As a young child he often went to St James' Park with his father to watch Newcastle United F.C.\nWhen he was only 15, Robson played football in a local team of boys aged 18. He became an apprentice electrician but still played football. In 1950, the Fulham F.C. manager, Bill Dodgin, Sr., visited Robson's home. He offered Robson a contract to play professional football. Robson signed the contract and moved to London.\nPlaying career.\nClub football.\nRobson played in his first professional football game for Fulham F.C. in 1950. He spent six years at the club before moving to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a325,000. He played for Albion for six years. During that time, he played in nearly 250 games, scoring over 50 goals. Albion said no when Robson asked for a bigger salary, and he moved back to Fulham. Fulham sold some important players after Robson came back to the team. This led Robson to think he would not win any trophies. He left Fulham in 1967 and joined the Vancouver Royals in Canada as both a player and a manager. However, he had to share the management role with someone else. Robson did not like this and moved back to England in 1968. He started to manage Fulham.\nInternational football.\nRobson was selected for England while at West Bromwich Albion. He played for England in the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was selected for the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Due to injury in a friendly against Chile, Robson had to leave from the squad. In total, he played 20 times for his country.\nManagerial career.\nEarly club management.\nRobson started his career as a manager at Fulham F.C. The team were relegated in his first season there. Robson was sacked the following season. In 1969 he became manager of Ipswich Town F.C. However he won no major competitions or trophies during his first four years in charge. In 1973 Ipswich won the Texaco Cup.\nOver the next nine seasons in the First Division, only once did Ipswich finish lower than the sixth place . This was the 1977\u201378 season however the club then went on to win the FA Cup, beating Arsenal F.C. 1\u20130 at Wembley. Three years later, Robson led Ipswich to victory in the UEFA Cup. The club beat Dutch team AZ Alkmaar 5\u20134 over two games. Robson moved on to manage the England national football team in 1982.\nEngland national team.\nRobson managed the England team 95 times, with 47 victories. In the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, he led the team to the quarter-finals where they lost to Argentina 2\u20131. Both Argentina goals were scored by Diego Maradona, including the famous \"Hand of God\" goal. Four years later, in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Robson led England into the semi-finals. This time they lost to West Germany in a penalty shoot-out. After this World Cup, Robson's contract was not extended by the Football Association.\nEuropean club management.\nRobson joined Dutch club P.S.V. Eindhoven in 1990. They won the league in his first two seasons. However, they did not win any European competitions and in 1992 Robson lost his job. Robson joined Portuguese club Sporting Clube de Portugal in July 1992. He led them to third place in the league in his first season. Defeat in Europe meant Robson lost his job again, in December 1994. He was quickly offered the manager's job by F.C. Porto. He led the team to victory in the Portuguese Cup and they won the league for two seasons in a row.\nIn the summer of 1996, Robson became manager at FC Barcelona. In his short time at the club, he signed Ronaldo and led the club to win the Spanish Cup, Spanish Super Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup. The next season Robson took a more administrative position before going back to Holland to manage P.S.V. Eindhoven for one season.\nThe next year, Robson went back to England to work for the Football Association. Soon after his return, Newcastle United F.C. manager Ruud Gullit left, and Robson took the manager's job at St James' Park. He managed the club until 2004 without winning any major trophies or competitions.\nInternational consultant.\nOn 13 January 2006, Steve Staunton was selected as manager of the Republic of Ireland national team. Robson was named in a support role as \"International Football Consultant\". Because of health problems, Robson left this position on 17 November 2007.\nLife outside football.\nRobson was married to his wife Elsie from 1955 until his death. They had three sons: Andrew, Paul and Mark.\nHealth.\nIn 1991, Robson was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, from which he recovered the following year. His ill health affected his work. While at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma. This meant he missed the first months of the 1995\u201396 season. He had many operations, including one in 2006 for a brain tumour. \nOn 17 October 2006, Robson was given the all-clear. He was set to complete his contract as consultant to the Irish team. In May 2007, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died of lung cancer on 31 July 2009 at his Durham home.\nOther activities.\nRobson was in some advertisements, including Carlsberg's \"Best Pub Side\" television advertisement. He also worked on ITV during the 2002 World Cup and the 2004 European Championship. He also wrote a weekly column for \"The Mail on Sunday\".\nHonours.\nBobby Robson was given several honours for his work in football. In 1990, after his eight years as England manager, he was awarded a CBE. In 2002, he was knighted. Both awards were for services to football. That year he was awarded the freedom of Newcastle upon Tyne. He also received the UEFA President's Award for 'services to football'. He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

These were placed in the subfamilies Murinae and Dendromurinae until very recently.

Deomyinae is the older and more appropriate name.\nDeomyines share no morphological characteristics that can be used to separate them from other muroids. Subtle aspects of the third upper molar have been suggested, though. This subfamily is united solely on the basis of shared genetic mutations. These conclusions have demonstrated good statistical support using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, as well as DNA-DNA hybridization.\nBecause of the lack of physical characteristics that supportthis group, it is very possible that the subfamily as it is currently recognized could grow bigger. Many of the genera currently placed in Murinae or Dendromurinae have never been included in a molecular phylogenetic analysis. There are potential surprises awaiting when they are.\nAll genera are found in Africa, suggesting the deomyines may have originated there.

They are usually called spiny mice in English. They look like mice of the genus \"Mus\". Spiny mice are small mammals with bare, scaled tails. Their coats have unusually stiff guard hairs that work the same way as the spines of a hedgehog. These stiff hairs are why they are called the \"spiny mouse\".\nEven though they look like members of the genus \"Mus\", scientists thhink that the African spiny mice may be more closely related to gerbils than to common mice.\nSpiny mice as exotic pets.\nAfrican spiny mice originated in the deserts of Africa. They are often kept as exotic pets in other parts of the world, particularly Western nations such as the United States. In the pet trade, they are commonly called Egyptian spiny mice or, more simply, spiny mice. Though these animals are like pet mice and rats, the tail of a spiny mouse is much more delicate. The spiny mouse should never be picked up by its tail and should be handled with care to avoid a degloving injury.\nHousing.\nBecause of their desert origin, spiny mice need warm temperatures and should be kept around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These animals are very social and should always be housed in groups when possible. As spiny mice are prone to obesity (getting too fat), it is important to provide a big space and a complex environment to encourage exercise. They need constant attention and should NEVER be housed in a cage smaller than 4X4 ft.\nReproduction.\nGestation length is between 38 and 42 days. Litters are normally 2 to 3 pups, but females may have up to 6 pups in a single litter. Other females within the social group may help in the birthing process and look after the pups. Pups are born with their eyes open and covered in fur. They will begin to leave the nesting area at about 3 days of age. Pups are weaned around 5 to 6 weeks and reach sexual maturity at about 6 to 9 weeks. A female can become pregnant at any time in the year and may have up to 12 litters in a year. Spiny mice can live for 4 to 5 years."}

It is made up of the Church of England and the Anglican Communion (a group of Anglican churches from many other countries). The term Anglicanism includes those who have accepted the English Reformation as embodied in the Church of England or in the offshoot Churches in other countries that have followed closely to its doctrines and its organisation.\nIn the English Reformation, the English Church kept the early Catholic ministry of bishops, priests, deacons, and most of the doctrine and liturgy. The event that led to the Anglican Church was the outright rejection of the Pope. This meant they also rejected the Catholic Church as an organisation.\nIt is sometimes seen as being the middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. That is why it is not always thought of as Protestantism.\nThe term Anglican comes from the phrase \"ecclesia anglicana\". This is a Medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246. It means 'the English Church'. The noun Anglican is used to describe the people, institutions, churches, traditions and ideas developed by the state established Church of England and the Anglican Communion, a theologically broad and often divergent affiliation of thirty-eight provinces that are in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury. \nWorship.\nAnglicans can have many different beliefs. For example, there are a range of beliefs about Holy Communion. Some Anglicans believe that the bread and wine becomes the actual Body and Blood of Christ. Other Anglicans think that Holy Communion is about remembering the life of Jesus Christ and his death on the Cross. The first ('High Church') is in the minority. It is similar to the belief of Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy. The second (the majority 'Low Church') is like the belief of most Protestants. It is fundamentally a Protestant church because the Bible is the source of authority, not the Pope.\nOrigin.\nThe name Anglican for this Church comes from the Latin word for English because the Church started in England. In the British Isles, Anglicanism has been the official or State religion in all parts at one time or another. Anglican Church leaders, and the State, worked together in what is called the alliance of Throne and Altar or Church and State. Together, they tried to make the Anglican denomination as broad and welcoming as possible to a wide range of Christian believers.\nThey did this to try to get as many citizens as they could to worship in the official church.\nOrigin in Britain.\nWhen Henry VIII wanted to divorce from Catherine of Aragon, the Pope refused to divorce him. As a result, King Henry split from the Roman Catholic Church and started the Church of England. The English Parliament, through the Act of Supremacy, declared King Henry VIII to be the \"Supreme Head of the Church of England\" in order to fulfill the \"English desire to be independent from continental Europe religiously and politically.\" This act said that the king, not the pope was the head of the Church of England. With this act, Henry VIII was not only free to divorce his wife and remarry, he also made England free from the interference of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. \nAlthough now separate from Rome, the English Church, at this point in history, continued to maintain the Roman Catholic theology on many things, such as the sacraments. Over time the Church of England was reformed even more, in what is known as the English Reformation, which it gained a number of characteristics which has finally formed the modern day Anglican Communion.\nIn the British Isles, and early British colonies, this was done to try to defeat both the followers of the Roman Catholic Church and all the kinds of Protestants too by including their best ideas, traditions, and practices in the Anglican Church. Now, the only place in the United Kingdom where Anglicanism is still the official religion is England, where the monarch, Queen Elizabeth II is the \"Supreme Governor on Earth\" of the Church of England. The effective government of the Church is by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the legal Church Parliament known as the General Synod.\nSpread of Influence.\nIn the rest of the world, Anglicanism was spread by overseas colonisation, settlement, and missionary work. It functions there as an ordinary denomination of Christianity without special status. Anglicans around the world join together in a group of national churches in countries where there are Anglican Churches to make the world-wide Anglican Communion. There are more than 80 million Anglicans in the world today. Most live in Africa and Asia and are not of British ethnic heritage anymore.\nIssues.\nThe Anglican Communion is struggling today with questions about the role of women and gay people in the Church. As the Anglican Communion deals with these serious issues, some have split into liberal and conservative groups. Already, there are Anglicans who have broken from the main Churches to form their own separate groups of believers. Some use the term Anglican combined with the word Catholic, Christian, Reformed, or Episcopal.\nAt the same time, leaders from the Anglican Communion hold talks with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches to try to work toward Christian unity. At times, there has been some progress. Also, the Anglican and Lutheran Churches have agreed to a high level of shared beliefs, leadership, and practices called intercommunion."}

These are the \"true\" gophers. Several ground squirrels of the family Sciuridae are often called gophers as well. They are not true gophers,though. The name \"pocket gopher\" on its own is used for a number of subspecies of the family. Pocket gophers, despite being largely a pest, are a symbol of the U.S. state of Minnesota, sometimes called \"the Gopher State\".\nDistribution.\nPocket gophers are widely distributed in North America, extending into Central America.\nAppearance.\nGophers are heavily built, and most are moderately large. They usually weigh a few hundred grams. A few species reach weights approaching 1 kg. Most gophers have brown fur which often closely matches the color of the soil in which they live. Their most characteristic feature is their large cheek pouches. The \"pocket\" in their name comes from these pouches. These pouches are fur-lined, and can be turned inside out. They extend from the side of the mouth well back onto the shoulders. They have small eyes and a short, hairy tail which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards.\nBehavior.\nAll pocket gophers are burrowers. They are larder hoarders, and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows. Gophers can collect large hoards. Their presence is unambiguously announced by the appearance of mounds of fresh dirt about 20 cm in diameter. These mounds will often appear in vegetable gardens, lawns, or farms, as gophers like moist soil. They also enjoy feeding on vegetables. For this reason, some species are considered agricultural pests. They may also damage trees in forests. Although they will attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including cats and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth.\nClassification.\nThere has been much debate among taxonomists about which races of pocket gopher should be recognised as full species. There are about 37 species in six genera."}

He first shows up in the Namek saga, and is shown to be one of Frieza's top two henchmen. Little is known about the character other than his pride, and his long history with Vegeta. His long, green braided hair, tiara and earrings might mean he was a high-class prince. He also wears a very long cape as well as leg and arm-warmers. Along with his choice of clothing, he wears the common armor that most of Frieza's men have, including the shoulder pads and a blue scouter. He is very vain and he considers himself to be of high standard. \nZarbon has the ability to transform into a reptilian beast. With brute strength and ferocity, his second form is much uglier than his first form. Upon transforming, his size increases as well as his muscular build and his skin becomes covered with what appear to be scales, like a reptile. It's clear that he finds this transformation ugly, as it not only offends his general love of beauty but also takes away his attractive form. In essence, he is both a beauty and a beast.\nStoryline.\nIn a speculative storyline written for the made-for-television set before the events of the Dragonball series, Zarbon appears to have acted primarily as Frieza's advisor. It was Zarbon who is shown to have advised Frieza that it would be wise to wipe out the entire Saiyan race before they posed a threat. He is depicted as being beside Frieza as the latter killed King Vegeta and destroyed Planet Vegeta.\nZarbon is first seen in the anime and manga when he accompanies Lord Frieza and Dodoria to the Planet of Namek in search of the Dragonballs, which Frieza desires so that he can wish for immortality. Zarbon helps in the collection of most of the Dragonballs, mercilessly slaughtering Namekians who seek to keep the Dragonballs hidden. After Vegeta, and the separate group of Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma show up, there are some scuffles that leave Dodoria dead. Zarbon is the only remaining top henchman of Frieza, and is sent to find another Namekian village, but instead comes face to face with Vegeta. Vegeta overpowers him at first, but when Zarbon realizes his life is threatened, he surprises Vegeta by transforming into his significantly more powerful -- and ugly -- form. This allows him to easily beat Vegeta, who he leaves for dead.\nAfter returning to Frieza, he is ordered to go back and retrieve Vegeta because he had hidden a Dragonball. Zarbon does this, bringing Vegeta to Frieza's medics for treatment of his wounds. However, Vegeta soon escapes with Frieza's dragonballs after being healed. Ordered to find the Saiyan Prince or face death himself, Zarbon again sets out in search of Vegeta. This time the Prince finds him, and the two battle while Krillin and Bulma look on. Zarbon eventually transforms, but his power is not enough to defeat a healed Vegeta, and he is killed in the battle.\nAppearances in other media.\nZarbon has appeared as a playable character in numerous video games, some of which include \"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi\", \"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai\", and \"Ultimate Battle 22\". In \"Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors 2\", he is a support-type character.\nHe is not only a playable character in \"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2\" but he has his own storyline (A What-if scenario added to the game to show Zarbon's love for his own beauty) in the main story mode of the game entitled \"Beautiful Treachery.\" Upon hearing of the power of the Dragon Balls, he hatches a plan to steal them and wish for eternal beauty. This plan mainly revolves around forcing Krillin to assist him, killing Dodoria, and distracting Frieza with a surprise visit from his brother, Cooler. He even gets to fight alongside Goku when his plan goes wrong. In the end, the battle between Frieza and Cooler destroys the planet, tragically taking Zarbon, despite the effects of his wish, with it.\nIn an issue of Beckett Anime, a Beckett magazine publication, Zarbon was voted as one of the top five greatest henchmen of all anime, and was the only character from \"Dragon Ball Z\" on the list.\nReferences.\n "}

He has protruding spikes on his arms and head. He also wears the common armor that most of Lord Frieza's men have, including the shoulder pads and a green scouter.\nStoryline.\nBefore the events of Dragon Ball Z, Dodoria was always by Frieza's side along with Zarbon. He witnessed the killing of King Vegeta and the destruction of planet Vegeta. Before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, he and a group of his elites were sent to eradicate Bardock and his team of fighters. He was successful in killing most of the team, but left Bardock alive after using a powerful mouth blast on him. Both Frieza and Zarbon looked down upon him for carelessly leaving him alive.\nDodoria accompanied his master Frieza and his comrade in battle, Zarbon, to the green Planet Namek in search of the Namek Dragonballs. While searching in a village for a Dragonball, Dodoria killed a few villagers, but before he could kill Dende, he was attacked by Krillin and Gohan. He pursued them, but they escaped after Krillin used a blinding attack called Solar Flare. Dodoria then launched an attack over a large area, which lead him to believe that he had killed them. On his way back, he was ambushed by Vegeta who easily overpowered him. Dodoria tried to bargain with Vegeta by telling him the secret of the destruction of Planet Vegeta, but he did not care. Vegeta killed him during his attempted escape. He only cameos again during the movie \"Fusion Reborn\" and in the Super Android 17 Saga when people from Hell are able to escape. He is killed again both times. In addition he also loses his scouter while searching for Vegeta.\nAbilities.\nDodoria uses his brute force to overwhelm his opponents. He has the generic powers that many other Dragon Ball characters share, including the ability to throw numerous exceptionally powerful rapid blasts. He can also emit blasts from his mouth as well, most commonly known as mouth blasts. The most noticeable trait that Dodoria has is his ability to throw his weight around. He is extremely fast in spite of his weight. He can perform multiple spins and aerial strikes regardless of his size.\nVideo game appearances.\nDodoria has appeared as a playable character in many video games, some of which include \"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai\", \"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi\", and \"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2\". He is also in \"Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors 2\" but only as a support-type character."}

{"id": "61616", "revid": "628332", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61616", "title": "Frieza", "text": "Frieza (\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b6, \"Fur\u012bza\") is a fictional character and first major villain in the \"Dragon Ball\" manga and \"Dragon Ball Z\".\nFrieza is one of the strongest aliens in \"Dragon Ball Z\". He enjoys invading other planets. Frieza is a very mean person who thinks he is very strong. He has destroyed planets, without mercy. He will even kill his own servants if he wishes to. Frieza is always trying to get more power. Because of this, he ends up fighting the heroes of \"Dragon Ball Z\" so he can get the Dragon Balls. The Dragon Balls are magical balls that can grant wishes to whoever collects all 7.\nFrieza is what the creator, Akira Toriyama, thought monsters looked like in his childhood.\nName pun and debate.\nFrieza's name is a pun on all things relating to the cold, with family members introduced later following his example. As his name ends in a short \"a\" vowel (rather than the long \"\u0101\" which usually signifies \"er\" in kana spellings on English words), the character's name is typically spelled with an \"a\" at the end (as opposed to \"Freezer\"). However, during FUNimation's dubbing of \"Dragon Ball Z\", the English writers went with the spelling of \"Frieza\". This has led to some conjecture over it: U.S. released video games and the English dub use \"Frieza\", while the Japanese language subtitles on FUNimation's DVDs and the Viz translation of the manga uses \"Freeza.\"\nPlanet Namek takeover.\nFrieza spies on Vegeta during his mission on Earth and learns that there are Dragon Balls on Planet Namek. He wants to get them and wish for Immortality, so Frieza and his soldiers try and steal the Dragon Balls from the Namekians. After Cui, Dodoria and Zarbon; three of Frieza's soldiers, are beaten by Vegeta, he sends the Ginyu Force, his strongest men, to get the Dragon Balls and destroy the Saiyan enemy. They almost win, but Goku comes to Namek and quickly defeats them.\nWhile trying to learn how to summon Porunga, the namekian dragon, Frieza is confronted by Nail, the strongest of the Namek warriors. Frieza defeats Nail effortlessly, leaving him to die after discovering that dende has ran to the Z-fighters to tell Krillin and Gohan how to use the dragon balls. Enraged, the great tyrant follows in pursuit of the heroes only to be faced with a much more powerful Vegeta who is now capable of matching Frieza's current strength.\nSpurred on by Vegeta, Frieza unveils his second form, allowing him to defeat Vegeta and critically injure Krillin, taunting Gohan with his friend's limp body. Before he can finish them off, Piccolo joins the battle - roughly even in abilities to Frieza, thanks to a splendid fusion with the dying Nail. The heroes are able to regroup, Dende healing them one after another. Frieza himself is seriously wounded for the first time: Krillin is able to chop off a portion of his tail using a Destructo Disk.\nHaving difficulty contending with Piccolo, Frieza again transformed, unlocking more of his power and enabling him to lay waste to his opponent. Finally he unveiled his true form, stressing that he intended to give his foes the pleasure of observing it before they died. As his first act, Frieza murders Dende, who had been healing the heroes, before brutally beating Vegeta. Just as Frieza was about to slay Vegeta, the healed Goku arrives on the battlefield, ready to fight Frieza. Vegeta, believing (incorrectly) that Goku had finally become a full-fledge Super Saiyan, taunts Frieza, even though, he, Vegeta, is too badly beaten to even stand. Frieza, proud of his past accomplishments, smirks before sending a Death Beam through the Saiyan Prince's heart. Teetering on the brink of death, Vegeta is able to tell the newly healed Goku of Frieza's genocide of the Saiyan race, imploring him to take revenge on behalf for all Saiyans. As Vegeta finishes his plea to Goku, he dies. Goku, saddened by Vegeta's death, buries him and vows to finish Frieza. Goku and Frieza then spar, with Frieza realizing that his opponent is the son of the Saiyan that gave him such trouble years before. Goku and Frieza are an even match for a while, until Frieza reveals that he had only been fighting at a mere fraction of his full power. Frieza then increases to 50%, and easily gains the upper hand against Goku, with Goku struggling to keep up.\nGoku is eventually able to heavily wound Frieza using a Spirit Bomb, calling on the energies of the entire planet Namek.\nBelieving the warlord dead, the heroes take the time to relax, not noticing that Frieza had emerged from the blast's crater. Frieza retaliates by mortally wounding Piccolo and murdering Krillin. Already bordering on the edge of his rage, Frieza killing Krillin, pushes Goku over it, his rage exploding, causing Frieza to inadvertently create what he had always feared: A Super Saiyan.\nIn the ensuing battle, Frieza and Goku trade blows, but as the fight progresses, Frieza's power gradually diminishes with the repeated punishment. In frustration, Frieza sends a Death Ball into the core of the planet, starting a chain reaction that would destroy Namek in \"five minutes\". Frieza unleashes 100% of his power. Frieza is now able to launch a huge assault against the surprised Goku, who had not expected Frieza's power to be as high as it is. Goku and Frieza face off and eventually after a very long battle, Goku gets the battle under his control, and calls off the fight, claiming it would be pointless to continue; Frieza losing strength rapidly and Goku already having humbled the tyrant. Humiliated, Frieza refuses to relent, attacking Goku with two Tsuibi Kienzan. As Goku dodges the attacks, Frieza ironically becomes distracted long enough to be vivisected by his own attack.\nBarely clinging to life but desperate to survive, Frieza begs and begs for mercy, which Goku hesitantly provides. Frieza's arrogance refuses to allow him to be beaten and saved by a Saiyan \"monkey\", and he expends what little energy he has left to attack Goku. Overcome with anger, Goku fires a Ki blast that consumes both Frieza and his attack, seemingly ending Frieza's reign over the universe.\nDeath of a great tyrant.\nUnbeknownst to Goku, Frieza survived the destruction of Namek. Able to do nothing more than breathe, Frieza floated in the planet's debris, kept company only by his thoughts of how the universe's conqueror had been thoroughly beaten by a Saiyan. His father, King Cold, had crews search the area, not believing his son to have been killed by something as insignificant as the explosion of a planet. What could be found of Frieza was salvaged, his missing limbs and face reconstructed with cybernetic enhancements. Scarred and bitter - though feeling stronger than he had before. Frieza's first thought upon rehabilitation is revenge on those who sullied him.\nFrieza beats Goku to Earth. Despite his ill intentions towards Earth and all who lived there, Frieza notes \"It's a good planet\" on first viewing. Frieza orders his henchmen to find and slaughter its inhabitants, with Frieza keen on killing his enemy's friends himself. However, his army is torn apart by the blade-wielding fighter Future Trunks. Frieza dismisses his challenger as an insolent child, and pays him almost no heed until the boy reveals himself as another Super Saiyan.\nDumbstruck, Frieza makes several different efforts to kill Trunks, each of which is parried easily. He then plays his trump card in the form of a Death Ball ten times the size of the one that destroyed Planet Namek. Even this is nonchalantly brushed away, until a mortified Frieza causes it to detonate with another shot of \"ki\". Thinking him to be destroyed by the assault, both the father and son are stunned when Trunks fires the Burning Attack out of nowhere. Fuming, Frieza becomes oblivious to his opponent's position, and is surprised and sliced in half by the Saiyan youth before being cut to pieces and blown to dust.\nAfter his death.\nAfter his death, Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances throughout the remainder of the series from Hell, including observing Goku's fight with Buu alongside other defeated villains from the series.\nIn \"Dragon Ball GT\", he teams up with Cell to act as a distraction for Goku while a horde of villains from the Z-Fighters' past escape Hell. Frieza traps Goku in the next world, but even allied with Cell, he is eventually defeated and remains in Hell.\nForms and transformations.\nOver time, Frieza's power became so great that his body could not comfortably contain it, and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength While changing shape from his \"first-form\", each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Frieza demonstrated four transformed states, each with increasing power (some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes).\nIn his first form, Frieza is a relatively short humanoid, albeit with a large chestnut-shaped skull with two horns. He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes. He wears the same upper-body armor that many of his subordinates (including the Saiyans) are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his \"dirty work\".\nHis second form is similar in appearance to the first, except much larger, both in height and muscle mass, Frieza claiming to have nearly doubled his power in this state. He also grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his skull curve sharply upwards into near right angles. His armor cannot contain his form and shatters, leaving him with a new, white natural armor covering his chest and shoulders. In this form, he somewhat resembles his father King Cold.\nFrieza's third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull. His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak. His original horns recede, and more now erupt in pairs along the length of his head. He walks and stands with a slight hunch, as if the strain of supporting his head was too much for even Frieza's own body to bear. This form vaguely resembles a Xenomorph from the Alien movies.\nDrastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final form Frieza instead regresses, becoming shorter and less bulky, his horns and spikes disappear and his physique becomes streamlined. His skin becomes pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest and shins.\nFrieza is also able to attain 100% power, greatly increasing his muscle mass. At 100% this is literally the peak of Frieza's strength and the maximum amount of power his body can output; his muscle mass becomes engorged compared to his previously sleek frame. However, due to the strain on his body he can not fight at full capacity for long, slowly weakening whether he is dealing or receiving damage.\nPhysically ruined while caught in the Planet Namek's explosion after his defeat, what remained of the still-living Frieza was salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold. The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced, with scarring and metal accouterments covering what little was left of his organic self. These enhancements allowed him to exceed the limits of power imposed by his fully organic form, though how much more powerful it made him is unknown.\nTechniques and special abilities.\nDaichiretsuzan \"(\"Great Earth Cutting Row\")\"\nHokaku Kon Dan \"(\"Imprisonment Ball\")\"\nTsuibi Kienzan\"(\"Following Energy Circle Slicer\")\"\nTransformation \"(Henshin)\"\nYubisaki kara no Shogekiha \"(\"Shockwave blast from the finger\")\"\nGogetsu Kiai\nVoice actors.\nToei Animation\nOcean Group\nFUNimation\nAustralia\nBrazil\nCanada\nFrance\nPortugal\nZimbabwe\nMovies and specials.\nFrieza appears in the following \"Dragon Ball Z\" movies and television specials:\nDragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku - DBZ TV Special #1; released October 17, 1990\nDragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge - DBZ Movie #5; released July 21, 1991\nDragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn - DBZ Movie #12; released March 4, 1995\nIn addition, Frieza's destruction of Planet Vegeta is shown from another point of view in \"Burn Up!! A Close, Intense, Super-Fierce Battle\" (DBZ Movie #8) and the mercenaries from \"Super Deciding Battle for the Entire Planet Earth\" (DBZ Movie #3) believe they would be strong enough to challenge Frieza after eating the fruit of the Tree of Might.\nHe also appears in footage from the Famicom game (and later Playdia remake) \"Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans\". In it Frieza seems to be somehow resurrected, with he and past villains Cooler, Tullece, and Lord Slug attacking Goku and his friends. Once it's revealed these are merely ghost-warriors meant to distract the heroes, however, the false Frieza and his allies are easily dealt with.\nVideo games.\n\"All games are listed in chronological order of release.\""}

The city features a lengthy dry season, spanning from November to June and a relatively short wet season covering the remaining four months. However, during those four months, Banjul tends to see heavy precipitation. August is usually the rainiest month, with on average more than 300\u00a0mm of precipitation falling. Temperatures are somewhat constant, though it tends to be slightly cooler during the wet season than the dry season.\nAccording to a Gambian government minister, Banjul is at risk of submerging under water by a metre rise in sea levels as a result of climate change and global warming.\nThe highest temperature recorded since records began in Banjul was 47.0\u00a0\u00b0C (116.6\u00a0\u00b0F) on 31 July 1980 and the lowest was 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C (32.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 1 May 1976. The coldest day on record in Banjul was 18.0\u00a0\u00b0C (64.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on 4 March 1988 and the warmest night on record was 31.0\u00a0\u00b0C (87.8\u00a0\u00b0F) on 13 April 1988."}

Some honey bees make honeydew into a dark, strong honey, called honeydew honey. Honeydew honey is valuable in parts of Europe and Asia because people think it can be used as a medicine.\nAnts collect honeydew from aphids.

{"id": "61662", "revid": "7643265", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61662", "title": "Mate (drink)", "text": "Mate is a traditional drink in some countries in South America, especially in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia and Brazil. The drink, which contains mateine (an analog of caffeine), is made by an infusion of dried leaves of yerba mate (\"Ilex paraguariensis\"). It is usually drunk with friends and served in a hollow calabash gourd with a \"Bombilla\", a special metallic drinking straw. The straw is also called a \"bomba\" in Portuguese, and a \"bombija\" in Arabic. It is traditionally made of silver. The gourd is known as a \"mate\" or a \"guampa\". In Brazil it called a \"cuia\". Even if the water comes in a very modern thermos, the drink is traditionally drunk from \"mates\" or \"cuias\". There are now modern \"tea-bag\" type infusions of mate called \"mate cocido\" which have been sold in Argentina for many years. They are drunk from a cup. They are sold under such trade names as \"Cruz de Malta\" (Maltese Cross) and in Brazil under the name \"Mate Le\u00e3o\" (Lion Mate).\nLike other brewed herbs, \"yerba mate\" leaves are dried, chopped, and ground into a powder called \"yerba\". The \"bombilla\" is both a straw and a sieve. The end which is placed in the drink is wider, with small holes or slots that let the brewed liquid in, but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture. A modern \"bombilla\" uses a straight tube with holes, or spring sleeve to act as a sieve. \"Bombilla\" means \"light bulb\" in Spanish, but locally it is \"little pump\" or \"straw\".\nIn some areas of the Middle Eastern countries of Syria and Lebanon it is also common to drink mate. The custom of drinking \"mate\" came from Arab emigrants from South America. Syria is the world's biggest importer of yerba mate in the world, importing 15,000 tons of yerba mate a year.\nHow to prepare mate.\n\"Mate\" is made differently in different places, with many arguments about which way is the best. In nearly all methods, the gourd is nearly filled with \"yerba\", and hot water (typically at 70\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C [160\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0F] and never boiling) is added.\nArranging the \"yerba\".\nThe most common way to make mate involves a careful arrangement of the \"yerba\" in the gourd before adding hot water. The gourd is filled one-half to three-quarters of the way with \"yerba\". Extra herbs may be added for either health or flavor benefits. This is most often done in Paraguay, where people get herbs from a local yuyera (herbalist). The \"mate\" is used as a base for their herbal infusions. When the gourd is filled, the preparer typically grasps it with their full hand. They cover the opening and roughly seal it with their palm. Then the \"mate\" is turned upside-down, and shaken vigorously, but briefly and with gradually decreasing force, in this inverted position causing the finest, most powdery particles of the \"yerba\" to settle toward the preparer's palm and the top of the mate.\nOnce the \"yerba\" is settled, the mate is carefully brought to a near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the \"yerba\" inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the \"yerba\" is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space on one side of the gourd and the lopsided pile of \"yerba\" on the other.\nAfter arranging the \"yerba\" along one side of the gourd, the \"mate\" is carefully tilted back onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the \"yerba\" as it is re-oriented to allow consumption. Some avalanche-like settling is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of \"yerba\" should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of the gourd. A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the \"yerba\" (though at least a portion should remain in place).\nAll of this careful settling of the \"yerba\" ensures that each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible, creating a smooth-running mate. The finest particles will then be as distant as possible from the filtering end of the \"bombilla\". With each draw, the smaller particles would inevitably move toward the \"bombilla\", but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out. A sloped arrangement provides consistent concentration and flavor with each filling of the \"mate\".\nInsertion of the \"bombilla\".\nNow the \"mate\" is ready to receive the \"bombilla\". Many people choose to pour warm water into the \"mate\" before adding the \"bombilla\", while others insist that the \"bombilla\" is best inserted into dry \"yerba\". Wetting the \"yerba\" by gently pouring cool water into the empty space within the gourd until the water nearly reaches the top, and then allowing it to be absorbed into the yerba before adding the \"bombilla\", allows the preparer to carefully shape and \"pack\" the \"yerba\"'s slope with the \"bombilla\"'s filtering end, which makes the overall form of the \"yerba\" within the gourd more resilient and solid. Dry \"yerba\", on the other hand, allows a cleaner and easier insertion of the \"bombilla\", though care must be taken so as not to overly disturb the arrangement of the \"yerba\". Such a decision is entirely a personal or cultural preference. The \"bombilla\" is inserted with your thumb on the upper end of the bombilla, at an angle roughly perpendicular to the slope of the \"yerba\", so that its filtering end travels into the deepest part of the yerba and comes to rest near or against the opposite wall of the gourd.\nBrewing.\nNow the \"yerba\" may be brewed. If the \"bombilla\" was inserted into dry \"yerba\", the mate must first be filled once with warm water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes no more than two or three minutes). Treating the \"yerba\" with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the herb from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the \"yerba\", until it reaches almost to the top of the gourd when the \"yerba\" is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the \"yerba\" beside the edge of the gourd's opening.\nOnce the hot water has been added, the mate is ready for drinking. It may be refilled many times before becoming washed out (\"lavado\") and losing its flavor. When this happens, the mound of \"yerba\" can be pushed from one side of the gourd to the other, allowing water to be added along its opposite side; this revives the \"mate\" for additional re-fillings.\nDrinking the \"mate\".\n\"Mate\" is traditionally drunk in a particular social setting, such as family gatherings or with friends. One person (known in Spanish as the \"cebador\") assumes the task of server. Typically, the cebador fills the gourd and drinks the \"mate\" completely to ensure that it is free of particulate matter and of good quality. The server subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the next drinker who likewise drinks it all, without thanking the server. The ritual proceeds around the circle in this fashion until the \"mate\" becomes \"lavado\" (\"washed out\" or \"flat\"), typically after the gourd has been filled about ten times or more depending on the \"yerba\" used (well-aged \"yerba mate\" is typically more potent, and therefore provides a greater number of refills). When one has had his fill of \"mate\", he or she politely thanks the \"cebador\" passing the \"mate\" back at the same time.\nThe drink has a pungent taste like a cross between green tea and coffee, with hints of tobacco and oak. Some drinkers like to add sugar or honey, creating \"mate dulce\" (sweet \"mate\"), instead of sugarless \"mate amargo\" (bitter \"mate\"). It is considered bad for the gourd (especially for the natural (squash or wood) ones) to be used for \"mate dulce\" so it is normal for households with drinkers of both kinds to have two separate gourds.\nTraditionally, natural gourds are used, though wood vessels, bamboo tubes and gourd-shaped \"mates\", made of ceramic or metal (stainless steel or even silver) are also common. Gourds are commonly decorated with silver, sporting decorative or heraldic designs with floral motifs.\nBoth the wood vessels and the gourds must undergo \"curing\" to get a better taste before being used for the first time and to ensure the long life of the gourd. Typically, to cure a gourd, the inside is first scraped with the tip of a bombilla to remove loose gourd particles. \"Mate\" herb and hot water is added next, and the mixture poured into the gourd. The mixture is left to sit overnight and the water is topped off periodically through the next 24 hours as the gourd absorbs the water. Finally the gourd is scraped out, emptied, and put in sunlight until completely dry.\nIt is common for a black mold to grow inside the gourd when it is stored. Some people will clean this out, others consider it an enhancement to the mate flavor.\nLegendary Origins.\nThe Guaran\u00ed people started drinking mate in the region that now includes Paraguay, southern Brazil,Uruguay, and north-east Argentina. The Guaran\u00ed have a legend that says that the Goddesses of the Moon and the Cloud came to the Earth one day to visit it but they instead found a Yaguaret\u00e9 (a kind of jaguar) that was going to attack them. An old man saves them, and, in compensation, the Goddesses gave the old man a new kind of plant, from which he could prepare a \"drink of friendship\".\nVariants and trivia.\nThere is another drink that can be prepared with specially cut dry leaves, very cold water and, optionally, lemon or another fruit juice, called \"terer\u00e9\". It is very common in Paraguay. Drinking and harvesting of Mate started in Paraguay in pre-Hispanic times. (Notice its scientific name, \"Ilex paraguayensis\".)\nIn Brazil the traditional \"mate\" or \"cuia\" is usually big with a corresponding large hole. In Uruguay and Argentina (especially in the capital, Buenos Aires) the mate is small and has a small hole, and people sometimes add sugar for flavor. In Bolivia and Peru, \"mate de coca\" is often sipped instead of ordinary mate.\nIn Uruguay there is even a national law that prohibits drinking \"mate\" while driving, because it caused many accidents of people getting scalded with hot water while driving. For the same reason, there is also a \"forbidden to drink mate\" sign in all public transportation buses.\nIn Uruguay and in the northeast of Argentina it is not uncommon to see people walking around the streets toting a \"mate\" and a thermos with hot water. In Montevideo, Uruguay\u2019s capital, it is possible to see some construction worker drinking mate while riding his bicycle early in the morning, on his way to work. In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by \"yerba mate\" producers provide free hot water to travellers, specifically for the purpose of drinking during the journey. There are disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and bombilla, and sets with a thermos flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case.\nIn Brazil, traditionally prepared mate is known as \"chimarr\u00e3o\", although in areas near the border with Uruguay the word \"mate\" is also used. Nowadays, in Brazil, \"mate\" is often toasted with sugar and prepared in a similar manner to tea, a custom that originated in Paraguay. Supermarkets, restaurants and fast food chains sell \"tea bags\" and prepacked \"iced tea\" packages and bottles. In Argentina, \"mate cocido\" (cooked mate) is made with a teabag or leaves and drunk from a cup or mug, with or without sugar and milk.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century most urban Chileans are not mate drinkers, but travel narratives such as Maria Graham's Journal of a Residence in Chile [2003(1824):8], show that there is a long history of mate drinking in central Chile. Many rural Chileans drink \"mate\", in particular in the southern regions, particularly Chilo\u00e9 and Magallanes, perhaps due to the influence of neighboring areas of Argentina.\nAccording to a major retailer of mate in San Luis Obispo, California, by 2004 \"mate\" had grown to about 5% of the overall natural tea market in North America . Bottled iced mate is widely available in California."}

It grows in Argentina, southern Paraguay, western Uruguay and southern Brazil.\nThe yerba mate plant is a shrub or small tree. It can grow up to 15 meters tall. The leaves are evergreen, 7\u201311\u00a0cm long and 3\u20135.5\u00a0cm wide. They have a serrated margin. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with four petals. The fruit is a red berry 4\u20136\u00a0mm diameter.\nInfusion.\nThe infusion called \"mate\" is prepared by steeping dry leaves (and twigs) of yerba mate in hot water, rather than boiling water like black tea or coffee. It is slightly weaker than coffee and much gentler on the stomach. Drinking mate with friends from a shared hollow gourd (also called a \"mate\" in Spanish, or \"caba\u00e7a\" or \"cuia\" in Portuguese) with a metal straw (a \"bombilla\" in Spanish, \"bomba\" or \"canudo\" in Portuguese) is an extremely common social practice in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Chile, eastern Bolivia and Brazil\n and also Syria and Lebanon.\nBrewed yerba tastes a lot like vegetables, herbs, and grass. It is similar to that of some varieties of green tea. Many consider the flavor to be very agreeable, but it is generally bitter if steeped in boiling water. It is therefore made using hot but not boiling water. Unlike most teas, it does not become bitter and astringent when steeped for extended periods, and the leaves may be infused several times. Additionally, one can purchase flavored mate in many varieties.\nIn Brazil, a toasted version of mate, known as \"ch\u00e1 mate\" or \"mate tea\", is sold in teabag and loose form, and served, sweetened, in specialized shops, either hot or iced with fruit juice or milk. An iced, sweetened version of toasted mate is sold as a soft drink, with or without fruit flavoring. The toasted variety of mate has less of a bitter flavor and more of a spicy fragrance. It is more popular in the coastal cities of Brazil, as opposed to the far southern states where it is consumed in the traditional way (green, drunk with a silver straw from a shared gourd).\nSimilarly, a form of mate is sold in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in tea bags to be drunk in a similar way to tea. This is known in Spanish as \"mate cocido\" or \"cocido\". In Argentina this is commonly drunk with breakfast or as part of \"merienda\" (roughly, afternoon tea), often with a selection of \"facturas\" (sweet pastries). It is also made by heating yerba in water and straining it as it cools.\nCultivation.\nThe plant is grown mainly in South America, more specifically in Northern Argentina (Corrientes, Misiones), Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1). The Guaran\u00ed are reputed to be the first people who cultivated the plant; the first Europeans to do this were Jesuit missionaries, who spread the drinking habit as far as Ecuador.\nWhen the yerba is harvested, the branches are dried sometimes with a wood fire, imparting a smoky flavor. Then the leaves and sometimes the twigs are broken up.\nThere are many brands and types of yerba, with and without twigs, some with low powder content. Some types are less strong in flavor (\"suave\", \"soft\") and there are blends flavored with mint, orange and grapefruit skin, etc.\nChemical composition and properties.\nMate contains xanthines, which are alkaloids in the same family as caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine, well-known stimulants also found in coffee and chocolate. Mate also contains elements such as potassium, magnesium and manganese. Caffeine content varies between 0.3% and 1.7% of dry weight (compare this to 2.5\u20134.5% for tea leaves, and 1.5% for ground coffee).\nMate products are sometimes marketed as \"caffeine-free\" alternatives to coffee and tea, and said to have fewer negative effects. This is often based on a claim that the primary active xanthine in mate is \"mateine\". This is wrongly said to be a stereoisomer of caffeine (it is not chemically possible for caffeine to have a stereoisomer). \"Mateine\" is an official synonym of caffeine in the chemical databases. So mateine \"is\" caffeine.\nResearchers at Florida International University in Miami have found that yerba mate does contain caffeine, but some people seem to tolerate a mate drink better than coffee or tea. This is because, caffeine aside, mate contains different chemicals from tea or coffee.\nFrom reports of personal experience with mate, its physiological effects are similar to (yet distinct from) coffee, tea, or guarana drinks. Users report a mental state of wakefulness, focus and alertness reminiscent of most stimulants. However, they often remark on mate's lack of the negative effects typically created by other such compounds, such as anxiety, diarrhea, \"jitteriness\", and heart palpitations. (The laxative effect of coffee derives from a substance that surrounds the raw bean, not the caffeine itself.)\nStudies of mate, though limited, have shown evidence that the mate xanthine cocktail is different from other plants containing caffeine, in its effects on muscle tissue, as opposed to those on the central nervous system. Mate has been shown to have a relaxing effect on smooth muscle tissue, and a stimulating effect on myocardial (heart) tissue.\nMate's negative effects are anecdotally claimed to be of a lesser degree than those of coffee, though no explanation for this is offered, except for its potential as a placebo effect. Many users report that drinking yerba mate does not prevent them from being able to fall asleep, as is often the case with some more common stimulating beverages. It enhances their energy and ability to remain awake at will. However, the net amount of caffeine in one preparation of yerba mate is typically quite high, in large part because the repeated filling of the mate with hot water is able to extract the highly-soluble xanthines extremely effectively. It is for this reason that one mate may be shared among several people and yet produce the desired stimulating effect in all of them.\nIn-vivo and in-vitro studies are showing yerba mate to exhibit significant cancer-fighting activity. Researchers at the University of Illinois (2005) found yerba mate to be \"rich in phenolic constituents\" and to \"inhibit oral cancer cell proliferation\".\nOn the other hand, a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer showed a limited correlation between oral cancer and the drinking of hot mate (no data were collected on drinkers of cold mate). Given the influence of the temperature of water, as well as the lack of complete adjustment for age, alcohol consumption and smoking, the study concludes that mate is \"not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans\".\nAn August 11, 2005 United States patent application (documents #20050176777, #20030185908, and #20020054926) cites yerba mate extract as an inhibitor of MAO activity; the maximal inhibition observed \"in vitro\" was 40\u201350%. A monoamine oxidase inhibitor is a type of antidepressant, so there is some data to suggest that yerba mate has a calming effect in this regard.\nIn addition, it has been noted by the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine that yerba mate can cause high blood pressure when used in conjunction with other MAO inhibitors (such as Nardil and Parnate)."}

It is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil. The seed of the Guaran\u00e1 fruit is a stimulant with thermogenic and diuretic properties.\nThe guaran\u00e1 fruit's color ranges from orange to red and contain black seeds which are partly covered by white arils. The color contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs; this has formed the basis of a myth \"(see below)\".\nGuaran\u00e1 plays an important role in Tupi and Guaran\u00ed Brazilian culture. The name 'guaran\u00e1' is derived from the Tupi-Guarani word \"wara'n\u00e1\". These tribes believed, it was magical, a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength. They also tell the myth of a 'Divine Child' that was killed by a serpent and whose eyes gave birth to this plant.\nUses.\nGuaran\u00e1 is mainly used as an ingredient in soft drinks and energy drinks. It is also used as a dietary supplement, generally to promote weight loss. In addition, it may be an ingredient in other foods.\nBeverages.\nIn addition to other chemicals, the guaran\u00e1 plant contains caffeine (sometimes called \"guaranine\"), theophylline, and theobromine. Water extracts of the guarana plant are central nervous system stimulants due to the content of these alkaloids. Energy drink manufacturers typically add synthetic caffeine or caffeine derived from coffee decaffeination, though many advertise \"natural\" caffeine from the seeds of guaran\u00e1.\nBrazil produces several brands of soft drink from guaran\u00e1 extract that contain no added caffeine. Each differs greatly in flavour; some have only a slight guaran\u00e1 fruit taste. They are typically fizzy and sweet, with a very fruity aftertaste. Most guaran\u00e1 drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries, such as Paraguay. Major brands include Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica, Guaran\u00e1 Schin from Schincariol and Guaran\u00e1 Brahma from AmBev, Kuat, and Guaran\u00e1 Jesus, a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it. Many local producers also create drinks not for export.\nUsing it to lose weight.\nStudies involving guaran\u00e1 show benefits to cognitive function.

In the United States, guaran\u00e1 holds a GRAS-status, i.e. \"generally regarded as safe\" and must be labeled as \"not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\"\nThe Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a study in June 2001. This study shows an average 11.2\u00a0pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guaran\u00e1 and damiana, compared to an average 1\u00a0pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days.\nA university study in Brazil of guaran\u00e1 extract showed a platelet aggregation decrease of up to 37% of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid of up to 78% of control values. This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs, an arterial blood clot can develop, resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke.\nA separate 1997 study of guaran\u00e1's effects on the physical activity of rats showed increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo.\nOther studies have shown antioxidant, antibacterial, and fat cell reduction (when combined with conjugated linoleic acid) properties in guaran\u00e1 \nAlthough side-effects of guaran\u00e1 are rare, drugs.com recommends, \"When considering the use of herbal supplements, consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable. Additionally, consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbal/health supplements may be beneficial, and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous\". Drugs.com also advises not to mix guaran\u00e1 with ephedrine.\nWhat guarana is made of.\nGuaran\u00e1 seeds consist of mostly reddish vegetable fiber and resin with a small amount of oil and water. Guarana contains different amounts of caffeine, theobromine, theophylline and other alkaloids, compared to coffee, tea, mate, or cocoa.\nDuke1992a: Duke, James A. 1992. \"Handbook of phytochemical constituents of GRAS herbs and other economic plants.\" Boca Raton, FL.

{"id": "61683", "revid": "115351", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61683", "title": "Sacred cow", "text": "Sacred cow is an idiom. It is an expression or phrase that is used without the literal meaning of being about a cow or religion. When spoken or written it means a person or a belief that has been respected for a long time. It has become sacred and people are then afraid or unwilling to criticise or question it. \nThe idiom is based on the honor shown to cows in Hinduism. It is thought to have started in America in the early 20th century. Similar idioms are used in many other languages. Saying \"holy cow!\" when surprised may be another example.\nAn actual 'sacred cow' or 'sacred bull' is a real animal that is treated with sincere respect in specific religions and their celebrations. They cannot eat the meat of cows because they are sacred.\nIn religion.\nIn Hinduism, cows are thought to be sacred, or deeply respected. Cows are seen as a 'caregiver' or maternal figure. One Hindu goddess, Bhoomi (\u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f), is usually shown in the form of a cow. She represents the Earth. Most Hindus respect cows for their gentle nature, and cows also represent strength. Hindus who eat meat will avoid eating [cow meat]. \nThere is a festival to thank cows for serving farmers for agriculture, This festival is called as \"Mattupongal\" which is one among the four days of the grand Indian festival called the Pongal which is completely focused on thanking each and every agricultural implement.\nCelebration of cows.\nIn the Hindu tradition, cows are honored, garlanded and given special feedings at festivals all over India. One is the annual Gopastami festival, dedicated to Krishna and cows. \nThe cow's nature is represented in Kamadhenu; the goddess who is the mother of all cows. In India, more than 3,000 institutions called Gaushalas care for old and infirm cows. According to animal husbandry statistics there are about 44,900,000 cows in India, the highest in the world. So while some old and infirm cows are treated in Gaushalas, the rest are generally abandoned at public places such as railway stations and bazaars.\nHonoring the cow inspires in people the virtues of gentleness and connects them with nature. The cow gives milk and cream, yogurt and cheese, butter and ghee. The milk of a cow is believed to refine a person. The ghee (clarified butter) from the milk is used in ceremonies and in preparing religious food. Cow dung is used as fertilizer, as a fuel, and as a disinfectant in homes."}
{"id": "61684", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61684", "title": "Murti", "text": "In Hinduism, a murti (also spelled murthi or murthy) usually means an image in which the Divine Spirit is expressed ('murta'). Hindus call the presence of God into the image so that they can communicate with him and receive his blessings.Hindus don't worship the murti or statue itself but the god who is present in their minds and souls. It can also be set up any where\nRole of murtis in worship.\nMurtis sometimes are abstract, but almost always stone or metal images of God in a human-like form like Shiva or Ganesha, Rama or Krishna, Saraswati or Kali. Murtis are made according to strict prescriptions and then installed by highly trained priests through a ceremony. The priests can then call on God in the image daily.\nMurtis in Hindu temples and shrines are a mystical form of communication with God and devas. This is similar to our ability to communicate with others through the telephone. One does not talk to the telephone; rather the telephone is a way to interact with another person. Without the telephone, one could not have a conversation across long distances; and without the sanctified image in the temple, one cannot easily talk with the Deity.\nGoing beyond murtis in Hinduism.\nThe image or murti of worship is a focus for prayers, although Hindus can see God is in all things, in stone and water, fire, air and ether, in the enlightened person of a satguru and inside their own soul. Some temples do not have any murti in the sanctum but a symbolic diagram. Some Hindu branches reject the worship of images.\nIn Hinduism, one of the highest achievements is when one goes beyond the need of all form and symbol. This is the yogi\u2019s goal obtained through meditation. Hinduism is also one of the religions that uses more symbols to represent God in preparation for getting beyond them.\nSacred images in other religions.\nImage worship appears to be an intelligent, mystical practice shared by all of the world\u2019s great religions. All religions have their symbols of holiness: the Christian cross, or statues of Mother Mary and Saint Theresa, the holy Kaaba in Mecca, the Sikh Adi Granth enshrined in the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the Arc and Torah of the Jews, the image of a meditating Buddha, the totems of indigenous and Pagan faiths, and the artifacts of the holy men and women of all religions. Any Christian respects the Bible and considers it sacred. His book and the Hindu\u2019s murtis are similar in this way. \nCritics of image worship consider this practice \"idolatry\". People who practice idolatry believe that God is the material object itself. Instead, Hindus worship murtis to call on the presence of the spiritual God and then communicate with him."}

Hardware (the physical part of the computer, such as the CPU or graphics card) runs software. This software will need computer memory to run, and do what it needs to do. Most computers in use today can do more than one thing at a time, they run more than one application. This is known as multiprocessing. \nIn this case, all the programs or applications that are running on the computer at a time share its resources. A computer does not have more processors or main memory (RAM) just because more programs run on it.\nVirtual memory is the idea that the application \"sees\" a \"block of memory\" of a given size. The application can use this memory as it sees fit. This block of memory is \"virtual\" in the sense that it comes from different parts. Some of it may be in the main memory of the computer, but some may also be on disk. The CPU has a special part, called Arithmetic Logic Unit which does some of the translations between application memory and system resources. Modern operating systems also do a part of this work.\nWhen a program tries to access a block of memory that is not in system memory, that program is stopped, and the block is loaded into system memory. What was in that part of the system memory is written to disk. This is usually called paging.\nCertain computer systems, such as embedded systems, do not use virtual memory, because they need a very fast response time, or one that always stays the same. One of the problems is that with virtual memory it is difficult to predict the response time. An application that uses a part of memory which needs to be loaded from disk will have a different response time from one that does not. Therefore, virtual memory concept is not used in embedded systems. "}

Many modern organisations, like universities, started as guilds. However, the basic idea of a guild was to control the training and practice of a trade or business. In Europe, guilds were given authority by the monarch. New young members had to serve as apprentices to a master for a certain length of time (such as seven years). At the end they became full members of the guild, and could set up on their own, and take apprentices of their own. That is the way the European world worked up to and including the first part of the 20th century.\nThere were guilds of weavers and dyers in the wool trade, of masons and architects in the building trade. There were guilds of painters, blacksmiths, bakers, butchers, and so on. The Corporation of the City of London includes the \"livery companies\". These companies were originally guilds. The senior members of the livery companies choose the Lord Mayor of London, the sheriffs and certain other officers.\nGuilds were common in the cities of the Middle Ages. After that, around 1700 to 1800 their influence lessened somewhat. Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith were much opposed to the idea of guilds. They believed that guilds hindered economic development and free trade."}

In 1276 the archbishop allowed a weekly market to take place nearby and this date is taken as the founding of the town. The town grew in the eighteenth century as a stage coach stop on the way to the popular seaside town of Brighton from London. In the nineteenth century railways put the town only 15 minutes from London by fast train and it grew 23 times in terms of the number of people living there between 1801 and 1901.\nThings to do.\nCroydon is well known for having many places to go shopping, which includes two shopping centres called Centrale and the Whitgift Centre. A third one called Park Place is planned. Croydon has been rated the 20 best shopping area in the UK. It is also well known for holding a lot of offices for companies to let. The council wants to keep Croydon a big town by building more offices and entertainment facilities so a new place called the Croydon Gateway is planned. Purley Way, just west of Croydon, is a large retail park area which has many shops like Comet (which went in admin in 2012), Sainsbury's, McDonald's, IKEA, Argos, M&amp;S, Boots along with a cinema and bowling alley.\nTransport.\nCroydon is very easy to get to. There is a large bus station on the edge of Croydon, and three railway stations called East Croydon, West Croydon, and South Croydon.\nCroydon is also served by Tramlink, a tram system, the only tram system in all of Greater London.

She was a cow goddess and was associated with the Milky Way. Hathor was the daughter of Ra.\nTemples and worship.\nThere are still remains of Hathor's temple in Dendera, Egypt. Dendara was her most well known. Her temple is 37 miles away from Luxor. It is thought that the temple of Hathor was built and decorated between the second century B.C.E. and the first century C.E. It had two intricately designed columned halls with the head of the goddess Hathor engraved in to each of them. Additionally, several shrines were built on the flat roof of the temple. There was also an enclosed sacred lake where the priests and patients would bath in order to heal themselves and become pure. There was sacred treasure hidden in two underground rooms near the sanctuary. At her temple people would pray to her for good wealth. Overall, Hathor was a busy goddess, as were most of the other gods and goddesses.\nGoddess' purpose.\nIn Egypt, Hathor was the goddess of love, beauty, dancing, music, and fertility. Hathor is one of the main goddesses. Hathor means \"House of Horus\". Before Hathor was the nice goddess she was the goddess of destruction. There was a myth that Ra ordered Hathor (Sekmet) to go out to eat the people. But days passed and Ra wanted Sekmet (Hathor) to stop but Sekmet was enjoying it. So Ra dyed beer red and scattered it all over the land. Sekmet saw it and thought it was the blood of the people she killed, so she drank it all and became drunk. After she slept for three days and woke up renewed, she didn't want to eat human flesh any more and became a new goddess, Hathor.\nAppearance.\nHathor appeared in four different forms. In human form, Hathor had a cow head with two cow horns. She was represented as a cow because cows were highly valued animals. She wore a menat which was a special necklace. A menat is a heavy beaded necklace with a crescent shape in the front and a tall mushroom shaped piece in the back. In one of her animal forms, she was a cow with an ankh. An ankh was the symbol of life. Another of Hathor's animal forms was a fierce lion. Hathor's symbol was a cow with a sun disc. The ancient Egyptians drew her as the sky of the Milky Way. Hathor's titles include the Golden One, the Lady of Song, the Mistress of Maidens, and the Lady of the Sycamore. She had traveled to Greece from a horrible argument with the gods and goddesses, she was banished from the land, and she was so ashamed of herself, she became the goddess of beauty and love.\nPower.\nHathor had a lot of power over Ancient Egyptians moods. Hathor had the power to bring laughter, happiness and joy. If she was far away the Egyptians mood would become miserable. Hathor very much enjoyed helping and changing others moods embracing them and loving them dearly. Hathor saw past the hell that was placed and granted Peace to all for eternity. Everyone then became their own Ptah."}

Santorini is 63 miles from the island of Crete. The total population is 13,600. \nSantorini is considered an active volcano. \nHistory.\nHuman presences on the island seem to have existed since the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. The excavations at Akrotiri have confirmed that human activity on the island continued until the eruption of the volcano around 1500 B.C, which entirely buried the island beneath very thick layers of pozzuolona. At that point, all traces of human activity vanished from the island until the end of the 13th century B.C. \nAccording to Herodotus, the island was initially called Strongyle (the Round One). Then later, because of its beauty, it was named Kalliste (the Fairest One). The Phoenicians settled in Kalliste, and after the Phoenicians, the Lacedaemonians arrived and renamed the island after their leader, Theras. In the 9th century B.C. Thera, became an important stopping point of that era in the travel routes between the East and the West. The Phoenician alphabet was adopted at this time for writing in the Greek language. Interestingly though, the conservative Therans, did not follow the cultural development of their counterparts in the other Cycladic islands. At about 630 B.C the Therans reached the north coast of the African continent where they founded Cyrene, the only Theran colony. From as early on as the 6th century B.C. Thera had its own coinage. During the Classical period in Greece [5th and 4th century B.C.] Thera did not play any significant role in the events of that Hellenic time. During the Peloponesian War Thera sided with Sparta, as expected. In Hellenistic times the island's strategic position made Thera an important base for the war campaigns in the Aegean of the successors to Alexander the Great. \nDuring the Roman Empire, Thera was little more than a small, insignificant island. However, when Christianity reached the island early, an organized church was established by the 4th century A.D. The island had neither political nor military significance in Byzantine times, although Alexius I Comnenus [1081 - 1118] founded the church of the Panagia Episkopi at Gonia. After the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade [1204], the Duchy of Naxos was founded and Thera became the seat of one of the four Catholic Bishops of the Duchy. The name Santorini was given at that time by the Crusaders, named after a small chapel of Agia Irini [Santa Irene] which some say was at Perissa and others say it was at Riva on Therasia. \nIn the years under Frankish rule [1207 - 1579], Santorini experienced the development of a thriving cotton cultivation and viticulture, but the island suffered as much from piratical raids as it did from the rivalries between the local Latin rulers as well as the Duke and the Sultan. \nThe Turkish dominion [1579 - 1821] resulted in the abolition of piracy and the development of international trade. The Santorinians created close contacts with the great harbours of the Eastern Mediterranean (Alexandria, Constantinople, Odessa) where they founded important communities. \nIn 1821, Santorini with its shipping power, took part in the fight for independence from the Turks, and in 1830, the island became part of the independent Greek state. Up until the beginning of the 20th century shipping, textiles, tomato production and viticulture were all flourishing markets, but the change from sail to steam-driven ships and the relocation of the island's factories to mainland Greece had a negative effect on the island's economy. After the 1956 earthquake there was a huge decrease in the population resulting in an economic catastrophe. Towards the end of the 1970s however, tourism began to develop, bringing economic relief to the island. \nThe present-day crescent shape of the island is a consequence of the activity of the volcano in prehistoric times. The island itself owes its very existence to the volcano. \n \nThe last huge eruption of the volcano dates back 3,600 years, to the late Bronze Age. Thirty million cubic meters of lava in the form of pumice and ash were blown to a height of up to 36 kilometers above the island. Pumice deposits, dozens of meters thick, buried one of the most prosperous pre-historic settlements of that period, feeding the myth of the lost Atlantis. \n \nThe mild activity of the volcano after this major eruption continues into the present (the most recent eruption occurred in 1950) building up two small islands within the caldera, Palea and Nea Kameni. These islands represent the volcano's most recent activity. \n \nThe marvelous dry climate and continuous sunshine create year around conditions which are perfect for observation, photographs and videos under an extraordinary variety of natural lights and colours that give the visitor the exceptional advantage of reaching the interior of the volcano by boat.\nCurrency.\nSince the 1st of January 2002, the Euro (EUR) is the currency of Greece. Notes in circulation are 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 euro while coins are in denominations of 1 euro, 2 euro, 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents and 20 cents. A currency converter is available here. \nBanks.\nThe banks on Santorini are open 8.00 am-2.30 pm Monday to Thursday and 8.00 am-2.00 pm on Friday. ATMs are available in almost all villages on Santorini. Most accept Visa and MasterCards as well as debit cards of internationally recognised networks. \nElectrical Appliances.\nThe electricity supply in Greece is alternating current, 220-250 volts, 50 cycles. Appliances for 110 or 120 volts may be operated by using step down transformers of 220 - 250/110 volts connected to each outlet. \nWater.\nBottled water is recommended for drinking. Tap water can be used for washing, bathing and cleaning your teeth. In the area of Oia the tap water that comes from the local desalination plant is drinkable. \nTransportation.\nThere is a taxi stand in the square of Fira. Taxi fares are based on a catalogue issued by the Ministry of Transport, and not based on the taxi's meter. KTEL buses carry out daily bus routes to almost all destinations. The KTEL terminal is also in the square of Fira next to the taxis. \nPostal Services.\nELTA is the official name of the postal service and their colours are blue and yellow. The main postal offices on Santorini are in Fira, Emporio and Oia. Postal agencies are in Pyrgos, Kamari and Perissa. Mailboxes are available in all the villages of Santorini. A standard letter or postcard less than 20\u00a0grams sent anywhere in Europe or abroad costs \u20ac0.65 (as per April 2007). Courier services are also available. \nInternet.\nMost hotels provide internet access for their guests. Internet caf\u00e9s are available mostly in Fira.\nAirport.\nSantorini National Airport,an airport that serves as both military and civil airport, is north of the village of Kamari. The airlines that run here include Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines. To get to and from the airport you can use buses, taxis, hotel car-pickups and rental cars."}

While \"Apostolic See\" can refer to any see founded by any of the Apostles, the term is in this case used to refer to the see of the bishop seen as successor of the chief of the Apostles, Saint Peter.\nAside from Rome, the archiepiscopal See of Mainz, which was also of electoral and primatial rank, is the only other Western see that bears the title of \"Holy See\", although this usage is less common.\nOrganization of the Holy See.\nThe Pope governs the Church through the Roman Curia. The Roman Curia consists of the Secretariat of State, nine Congregations, three Tribunals, 11 Pontifical Councils, and a complex of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level. The Secretariat of State, under the Cardinal Secretary of State, directs and coordinates the Curia. The current incumbent, Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, is the Holy See's equivalent of a prime minister. Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary of the Section for Relations With States of the Secretariat of State acts as the Holy See's foreign minister. Bertone and Mamberti have been named in their respective roles under by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2006.\nAmong the most active of the major Curial institutions are the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees church doctrine; the Congregation for Bishops, which coordinates the appointment of bishops worldwide; the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, which oversees all missionary activities; and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, which deals with international peace and social issues.\nInternational organizations.\nThe Holy See is especially active in international organizations and is a member of the following groups:\nThe Holy See is also a permanent observer of the following groups:\nThe Holy See is an observer on an informal basis of the following groups:\nThe Holy See sends a delegate to the Arab League in Cairo. It is also a guest of honour to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nThe Holy See, not the Vatican City, maintains diplomatic relations with states (such as with the United Kingdom), and participates in international organizations. Foreign embassies are accredited to the Holy See, not to the Vatican City, and it is the Holy See that establishes treaties and concordats with other sovereign entities. When necessary, the Holy See will enter a treaty on behalf of the Vatican City.\nUnder the terms of the Lateran Treaty, the Holy See has extraterritorial authority over 23 sites in Rome and five Italian sites outside of Rome, including the Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo.\nThe same authority is extended under international law over the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See in a foreign country."}

It was put together by the methods of historical linguistics.\nDiscovery and reconstruction.\nThere are different ideas about when and where PIE was spoken. PIE may have been spoken as a single language. Then it began to separate, around 3700 BC. The exact date is not known. The most popular hypothesis for where it came from and how it spread is called the Kurgan hypothesis. In this theory, its origin is in the Pontic-Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe.\nMethod.\nThere is no direct evidence of PIE because it was never written. All PIE sounds and words are reconstructed from later Indo-European languages. The asterisk symbol is used to mark reconstructed PIE words, for example: *' 'water', *' 'dog', or *\"\" 'three (masculine)'. Many words in modern Indo-European languages seem to have come from such \"proto-words\" by regular sound changes, such as Grimm's law.\nPhonology.\nThe following phonemes are generally accepted:\nAccent.\nPIE had a \"free pitch accent.\" That means that the stress of a word could happen on any syllable and could change even for related words. Different meanings of a word could be marked only with high or low pitch.\nMorphology.\nPIE was an inflected language: it had roots with suffixes. That basic root shape is often altered by the \"ablaut\", a system of regular vowel changes. An example of ablaut in English is the strong verb \"sing\", \"sang\", \"sung\" and the related noun \"song\".\nSynthetic.\nMost Indo-European languages are synthetic. That means they have many morphemes per word. Morphemes may be combined to make complex words, as in German Root words may be put on \"bound morphemes\" to show their function, which are morphemes that appear only as part of a larger word.\nThose methods were probably used often in PIE. Languages like English, which don't have a lot of combinations like that, come from from earlier, more typical Indo-European languages. English comes from from Anglo-Saxon, a Western Germanic language. The fact that English once was synthetic like German is shown by cranberry morphemes, which are so called because the \"cran-\" is a fossil of a word that no longer exists. Also, \"mulberry\" and \"raspberry\", where also the first syllable is a bound morpheme.\nSample texts.\nBecause PIE was spoken a very long time ago, there are no texts anymore. Scientists have tried many times to make example texts for to show what it could be like. These are just educated guesses. People have tried for 150 years to make a single sentence in PIE, but this has not happened yet. Even so, such texts are still useful because they show what PIE might have looked like.\nPeople have rewritten a text by Schleicher multiple times as an example text:\nSchleicher (1868).\n\"Avis akv\u0101sas ka\"\nSchleicher's reconstruction says that that the o/e vocalism was secondary. His version of PIE is more like Sanskrit than modern reconstructions are.\nHirt (1939).\n\"Owis ek\u2019w\u014dses-k\u02b7e\"\nHirt introduced the o/e vocalist and some rather different consonants.\nEnglish translation.\n\"The Sheep and the Horses\"\nSome of the differences between the texts are just different spelling conventions: w and u\u032f, for example, are only different ways to indicate the same sound, a consonantal u. However, many other differences happen because there are different ideas on the sounds and the structure of PIE."}

Waldheim was an officer for Germany in the Second World War. He rose to be an oberleutnant in the Wehrmacht. Much historical interest has centered on Waldheim's role in Operation Kozara in 1942. According to one post-war investigator, prisoners were routinely shot within only a few hundred meters (yards) of Waldheim's office, and away at the Jasenovac concentration camp. Waldheim later stated that \"he did not know about the murder of civilians there\".\nThere was a commission of several historians who looked at the issue. They did find that Waldheim had behaved as he should have done. He did not commit any war crimes. However, in his role of an officer, he must have known about the deportation of about 40.000 Jews into concentration camps. These transports, as well as the shooting of soldiers were a clear breach of law.\nBecause of this, he was not allowed to travel to the United States any more.\nIn 1990, he had a success: Saddam Hussein held several foreigners as hostages at the start of the Second Gulf War.

For a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it.\nIn the early 17th century, Cardinal Bellarmine gave a well known example of the older sense of the word in his warning to Galileo: that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality, but merely as a hypothesis.\nToday, a hypothesis refers to an idea that needs to be tested. A hypothesis needs more work by the researcher in order to check it. A tested hypothesis that works may become part of a theory\u2014or become a theory itself. The testing should be an attempt to prove that the hypothesis is wrong. That is, there should be a way to falsify the hypothesis, at least in principle if not in practice.\nPeople often call a hypothesis an \"educated guess\".\nExperimenters may test and reject several hypotheses, before solving the problem or reaching a satisfactory theory.\nA 'working hypothesis' is just a rough kind of hypothesis that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research. The hope is that a theory will be produced, even if the hypothesis ultimately fails.\nHypotheses are especially important in science. Several philosophers have said that without hypotheses, there could be no science. In recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to testing hypotheses (and the scientific method in general), to form a more complete system. The point is that hypotheses are suggested ideas, which are then tested by experiments or observations.\nStatistics.\nIn statistics, people talk about correlation: correlation is how closely related two events or phenomena are. A proposition (or hypothesis) that two events are related cannot be tested in the same way as a law of nature can be tested. An example would be to see if some drug is effective to treat a given medical condition. Even if there is a strong correlation that indicates that this is the case, some samples would still not fit the hypothesis.\nThere are two hypotheses in statistical tests, called the null hypothesis, often written as formula_1, and the alternative hypothesis, often written as formula_2. The null hypothesis states that there is no link between the phenomena, and is usually assumed to be true until it can be proven wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. The alternative hypothesis states that there \"is\" some kind of link. It is usually the opposite of the null hypothesis, and is what one would conclude if null hypothesis is rejected. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms. It can be two-sided (for example: there is \"some\" effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the supposed relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance)."}

Such observations are hard to reproduce because they may vary even with respect to the same stimuli. Thus they are not of much use in exact sciences like physics which require instruments which do not define themselves. It is thus often necessary to use various engineered instruments like: spectrometers, oscilloscopes, cameras, telescopes, interferometers, tape recorders, thermometers etc. and tools like clocks, scale that help in improving the , quality and utility of the information obtained from an observation. \nThe accuracy and tremendous success of science is primarily attributed to the accuracy and objectivity (i.e. repeatability) of observation of the reality that science explores.\nThe role of observation in the scientific method.\nScientific method refers to techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable, empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. A scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.\nAlthough procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, identifiable features distinguish scientific inquiry from other methodologies of knowledge. Scientific researchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena, and design experimental studies to test these hypotheses. These steps must be repeatable in order to dependably predict any future results. Theories that encompass wider domains of inquiry may bind many hypotheses together in a coherent structure. This in turn may help form new hypotheses or place groups of hypotheses into context.\nAmong other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.\nTesting and improvement.\nThe scientific process is iterative. At any stage it is possible that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject they are considering. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of the experiment to produce interesting results may lead the scientist to reconsidering the experimental method, the hypothesis or the definition of the subject.\nOther scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage. They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions. Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else. Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility."}

A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities. Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths, from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared.\nIn general, any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum. Below optical frequencies (that is, at microwave, radio, and audio frequencies), the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device.\nSpectroscopes.\nSpectrometers are used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials. Spectroscopes are used often in astronomy and some branches of chemistry. Early spectroscopes were simply a prism with graduations marking wavelengths of light. Modern spectroscopes, such as monochromators, generally use a diffraction grating, a movable slit, and some kind of photodetector, all automated and controlled by a computer.

She and her brother and husband, Shu, were created by Atum, Ra or Amun. Tefnut was the mother of Nut and Geb also she is associated with the lion. In art she is represent as a woman with head of the lion with Sun disc.\nGod's plan.\nTefnut, along with Shu, were the first deities created by Ra. She had other names, such as Tefenet and Tefnet. She was mainly in charge of moisture, but was also responsible for Order, Time, Justice, Heaven and Hell. She was very closely related to both the sun and the moon. She was known as both the left (moon), and right (sun): 'Eyes of Ra.'\nPhysical description.\nOnce Tefnut fled from Ra as a lioness, causing a great drought. Only Thoth could persuade her to return, so he went to Nubia and got her back. When she got back, there was great rejoice in all the temples. After that incident, Tefnut, normally wearing her fathers\u2019 sun disk, was seen as a lioness, or a woman with a lions\u2019 head. Very rarely ever again was she seen portrayed as a full woman. When Tefnut was in the royal court, she wore a crown made of sprouting plants. Sometimes she was seen lying horizontally between the ground and the sky. She was sometimes pictured with her husband, Shu, helping to hold up Nut. She cried with the pain, and when she cried, that made the ground fertilized.\nPower &amp; magic.\nTefnut sat in judgment of the dead in the underworld. Tefnut wears her fathers\u2019 sun disk, a symbol of power. She carries a scepter and wears an ankh, the symbol of life. As she was the goddess of moisture, she was also related to other deities of moisture and wetness. She was seen holding up the sky with her brother/husband Shu. As she was in charge of moisture, she held other roles as well. Some of them were: Order, justice, time, the weather,Heaven, and Hell. Above all, her main role was to bring moisture down on the ancient Egyptians.\nWorship.\nTefnut was worshipped in lion form in Leontopolis (May-ta-hut). Part of the city of Denderah (Iunet), was known as \u2018The House of Tefnut.\u2019 Some of Tefnut\u2019s festival dates were the 20th of August, the day of satisfying the Hearts of the Ennead. Another festival date was the 29th of October, which was the day of Going Forth of Het-Hert and the Ennead. The last festival date was the 15th of November, the Ennead Feast in the House of Kay Heru and Wasir. Tefnut does not have any main centers of Worship, or any known temples dedicated to her."}

In art, he was shown with the head of a crocodile. In temples to Sobek, live crocodiles were kept in pools to honor him.\nJobs &amp; Roles.\nSobek was worshipped wherever the Nile was presenting difficulties. Sobek was the ancient Egyptian god of crocodiles and controlled the waters. Sobek\u2019s role was to protect the pharaoh from evil but it differs with each person. He was the most popular god in Arsinoe (Crocodilopolis in Greek), and was considered the Lord of Faiyu (a place in Egypt).\nMyths &amp; stories.\nOne day when Sobek was in the Nile, he saw Osiris\u2019 (who was murdered by Set, the god of chaos) body. He was so hungry he could not resist eating part of it. His tongue was cut off as a punishment, which is why crocodiles have no tongues in Egyptian myths. He also caught the sons of Horus when they were born.\nPhysical Appearance.\nSobek was seen as a crocodile headed man or very rarely a plain crocodile. Egyptians mummified crocodiles in honor of Sobek. Crocodiles were treated like household pets and were adorned with anklets and other decorative jewels. In temples people kept sacred crocodiles because they thought that they were images of Sobek on earth. The sacred crocodiles were a big attraction, the Egyptian\u2019s believed that if the crocodiles were fed and they accepted their food, you would receive blessings from the God Sobek.\nFamily &amp; friends.\nSobek was a friend of Horus. Sobek\u2019s mother Neith was considered the sister of Isis, who was Horus\u2019s mother. This made Sobek the cousin of Horus, which was a very important fact because Horus was a major God. In other myths, Sobek was allied with Set. Set was also sometimes thought of as Sobek's father."}

It has a population of about 4,360,000 people. The city is also Tanzania's richest city. It is an important economic centre. \nDar es Salaam was the capital city of Tanzania until 1996. Even though the capital was moved to Dodoma, Dar Salaam is still the location of much of the country's government. It is also the capital of the Dar es Salaam Region. The city's name in Arabic means \"Abode of Peace\". Dar es Salaam was at one time called Mzizima. \nPopulation.\nThe population of Dar es Salaam is increasing at a rate of 4.39% each year. It is the 3rd fastest growing city in Africa and the 9th fastest in the world. The metropolitan area population is expected to reach 5.12 million people by 2020. \nThis rate is far above the world average. Globally, the growth rate of the human population has been declining since a peak in 1962 and 1963 of 2.20% per annum. In 2009 the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1%.\nDar es Salaam's rapidly expanding population presents both significant challenges and opportunities. Infrastructure development has not kept pace with the population growth so there is significant resource pressure, especially on road networks and the national power grid. However, a sizeable population with a growing middle class continues to attract investment in areas such as retail (shopping malls), entertainment (cinemas) and communication (high speed internet).\nGeography.\nDar es Salaam is located on a large harbour on the Eastern Indian Ocean coast of Africa.\nDar es Salaam has a tropical savanna climate (\"Aw\" in the Koeppen climate classification). This is because it is very near the equator and the warm Indian Ocean. The city usually has hot and humid weather during much of the year. Each year the area has two rainy seasons. These are called 'the long rains' (in April and May) and 'the short rains' (in November and December). Nearly 1100mm of rain fall each year on the area.\nHistory.\nIn 1859, Albert Roscher of Germany became the first European to go to Mzizima (\"healthy town\"). In 1866 Sultan Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar gave it its current name. It is an Arabic phrase meaning \"Haven of Peace\". Dar es Salaam had much growth starting in 1887, when the German East Africa Company created a station there. \nThe town's growth was because it was the administrative and commercial centre of German East Africa. It was also helped by the growth of industry caused by the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s.\nGerman East Africa was captured by the British during World War I and its name was changed to Tanganyika. Dar es Salaam was still the territory's administrative and commercial centre. \nAfter World War II, Dar es Salaam had a period of rapid growth. Tanganyika became independent from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to be its capital. It remained the capital when in 1964 Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form Tanzania. However, in 1973, it was decided to move the capital to Dodoma. This has not yet been completed, and Dar es Salaam is still Tanzania's primary city."}

Shu was described as dwelling in the sun's disk. He often appeared as a bearded man holding up the sky while protecting the earth. At times he was depicted as a lion or a human with a lion's head. At other times he wore four ostrich feathers. These feathers symbolized the four columns that held up the sky when Shu himself was not there to do the job. When in his role as god of light, Shu carried a sun disk.\nHymn.\n\"That is my daughter, the living female one, Tefnut, who shall be with her brother Shu. Life is his name, Order is her name. [At first] I lived with my two children, my little ones, the one before me, the other behind me. Life reposed with my daughter Order, the one within me, the other without me. I rose over them, but their arms were around me.\" Was a hymn to Shu. Ancient Egyptians prayed to him for a good life and prayed to him for light. People worshipped Shu in prayers, hymns, and in a chapel. People gave him offerings. Shu appeared in tombs and temples. He was a well known god.\nTemples.\nShu belongs to the cosmic deities and as such no temples were dedicated to him. Cosmic deitys were never worshipped in a pesonified form, therefore there was no need for temples to worshipped them. A chapel was built to Shu, Atum, and Tefnut. No festivals has been historically verified Shu was worshipped through prayers and gatherings.\nWorshipped.\nShu was the god of the water, light, wind, and the atmosphere. He was also the god of dry air. Shu's name meant \"dryness\" or \"emptiness\". Shu was mentioned in Coffin Texts and Pyramid Texts, but is not well known outside these religious texts until after the New Kingdom. During this time period, Shu became connected with the gods Onuris, Khonsu, and Soptu, and was worshipped along with them in their people. He was praised by some and not by others.\nMyths.\nRa created Shu. He was created when Ra said, \u201cShu the moisture\u201d, and then Shu was sneezed out of Ra\u2019s nostrils. There are many creation myths about how Ra was born. For example, an egg that hatched created Ra. Shu was one of the first deities."}

The city is served by Malabo International Airport, while ferries sail from its port to Douala and Bata.\nHistory.\nThe city was first founded by the British in 1827. They paid Spain for use of the island during colonial times. The British named the city Port Clarence. It was used as a naval station help stop the slave trade. Many newly freed slaves settled there before the creation of Sierra Leone as a colony for freed slaves. While many of them later moved to Sierra Leone.\nWhen the island returned to Spanish control, Malabo was renamed Santa Isabel. It replaced the town of Bata as the capital of the country in 1969. The city was renamed Malabo in 1973 because President Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema wanted to replace European place names with \"authentic\" African ones."}

The name derives from a translation of \"Skjaldbrei\u00f0ur\", an Icelandic shield volcano whose name means \"broad shield,\" from its resemblance to a warrior's shield. \nShield volcanoes are usually formed by lava that flows easily. Consequently, a volcanic mountain having a broad profile is built up over time by flow after flow of relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano. Many of the largest volcanoes on Earth are shield volcanoes. \nThe largest is Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii. Shield volcanoes can be so large they are sometimes considered a mountain range, such as the Ilgachuz Range and the Rainbow Range, both of which are in Canada. These shield volcanoes formed when the North American Plate moved over a hotspot similar to the one feeding the Hawaiian Islands, called the Anahim hotspot. There are also shield volcanoes, for example, in Washington, Oregon, and the Galapagos Islands. The Piton de la Fournaise, on R\u00e9union Island, is one of the more active shield volcanoes on earth, with one eruption per year on average.\nShield volcanoes are known to form on other planets. The largest known mountain in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars, is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes on Mars are higher and much more massive than those on Earth. \nOn Earth, because of plate tectonics, hotspot volcanoes eventually move away from the source of their magma and the volcanoes are individually less massive than might otherwise be the case. Shield volcanoes usually occur along constructive boundaries or above hotspots. However, the many large shield volcanoes of the Cascade Range of northern California and Oregon are over a more complex environment."}

In such an eruption the volcano's magma chamber is empty enough for the ground above it to drop.\nA caldera may look like a volcanic crater except that a crater is made by blasting outward, not by collapsing inward. The word \"caldera\" comes from the Portuguese language, meaning \"cauldron\". Some complex features are made by both processes.\nWhen Yellowstone Caldera last erupted some 650,000 years ago, it released about 1,000\u00a0km3 of material, covering much of North America in debris up to two metres thick. By comparison, when Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, it released 1000 times less material.\nThe ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the Lake Toba eruption in Indonesia.\nAbout 75,000 years ago, the Toba catastrophe released about 2,800\u00a0km3 of ejecta. This was the largest known explosive eruption within the last 25\u00a0million years. In the late 1990s, anthropologist Stanley Ambrose suggested that a volcanic winter induced by this eruption reduced the human population to about 2,000 20,000, resulting in a population bottleneck. Others suggested that the human race was reduced to about five to ten thousand people. \nHowever, there is no direct evidence that the theory is correct and some evidence that it is not.\nLarger calderas.\nEruptions forming even larger calderas are known. At La Garita Caldera in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, the 5,000\u00a0km3 Fish Canyon Tuff was blasted out in a single major eruption about 27.8\u00a0million years ago.\nAt some points in time, rhyolitic calderas have appeared in distinct clusters. The remnants of such clusters may be found in places such as the San Juan Mountains of Colorado (formed during the Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene periods) or the Saint Francois Mountain Range of Missouri (erupted during the Proterozoic)."}

{"id": "61917", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61917", "title": "Software bug", "text": "A software bug is a problem with the code in a computer program which makes it not work properly. They can cause inconvenience to the user and may make their computer crash or freeze. Most computer programs have bugs. A program that has a large number of bugs (or possibly a single or a few serious bugs) is said to be buggy.\nMost bugs are caused by bad programming by the developer, but sometimes they can be caused by compiler problems. When bugs are found, people send bug reports to the developer to tell them about the bug and let them fix it.\nSometimes, people say that their computer has a bug when something is wrong with it. The problem is usually caused by a computer virus which has infected their computer and is making it slow or do different things.\nSome bugs are harmless, for example, many video games incorrectly allow objects to move through walls. Other bugs are more severe, for example, a bug in a navigation system that causes an airplane to explode.\nTypes of bugs.\nBuffer overflow.\nA buffer overflow happens when a program writes to or reads from an area of memory that it is not supposed to access.\nArithmetic overflow.\nAn arithmetic overflow happens when a number contained in a variable is increased beyond the highest number that the variable allows. This will usually cause the number to reset back to zero.\nInfinite loop.\nAn infinite loop happens when a program enters a loop (a series of instructions that is repeated many times) and there is no way out of the loop. This can cause the program to freeze.\nRoundoff errors.\nIf a floating point variable doesn't have enough precision, the number stored in it can be inaccurate. This can cause various problems depending on the type of program, for example it could cause a navigation program to navigate to an unintended location, or distorted sound in an audio recording program.\nDivision by zero.\nDivision by zero is an invalid math operation. If a program divides an integer by zero, it will crash. On Linux, the message displayed when this bug occurs is \"floating point exception\", even though floating point numbers were not involved. Floating point math sometimes allows division by zero. This will usually result in a special \"not a number\" value.\nClipping problems.\nIn video games, clipping problems, also called collision detection problems, occur when an object passes through a barrier (such as a wall, floor, or ceiling) that it was not intended to pass through. This is a very common bug found throughout many video games. This can happen, for example, in Doom 2 when a crushed monster is resurrected by an arch-vile. Clipping problems can often be used as a time-saving tactic in speedruns, for example, in Super Mario 64 it is possible to skip walking up the spiral staircase in the castle by jumping through the ceiling.\nSecurity bugs.\nSecurity bugs are bugs that allow an intruder to either gain access to the computer, or cause the computer to crash. Causing the computer to crash is called a denial-of-Service attack. Security bugs are considered especially important to fix because they might allow intruders to steal important information such as credit card numbers or passwords. Examples of security bugs include Heartbleed and Shellshock.\nMisbugs.\nA misbug is a bug that has been used as a feature. An example would be a bug in an Android phone that allows users to gain root access.\nHardware bugs.\nSome bugs affect hardware (the physical parts of a computer) instead of software. For example, running the instruction codice_1 on old Pentium processors would cause the processor to stop working until rebooted. Since hardware bugs are physical design flaws, they can not be corrected with a software update, although it may be possible to work around (hide) the bug with a software update."}

Sometimes, the police need to 'tap' into telephone calls to catch terrorists or other criminals. Evidence from illegal tops may be used in criminal trials in some countries. "}

It believes in a personal experience with God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit (); the same as in the Biblical account on the Day of Pentecost. Pentecostalism is similar to the Charismatic groups, but it came about earlier and separated from the main church branches. Charismatic Christians, at least in the beginning, tended to stay in their denominations and did not divide away.\nBeliefs.\nThere are different types of Pentecostal churches. Most believe that you must be saved by believing in Jesus as their Savior; to be forgiven for their sins and to be pleasing to God. Pentecostals also believe, like most other evangelicals, that the Bible is true and must be obeyed in decisions of faith. In this majority group, speaking in tongues is the sign of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and is not required for salvation. To this group, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a supernatural gift for ministry that one receives after they have become a Christian.\nOther groups believe in an \"\" based salvation. This means a person needs to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus. They then receive the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost). In this belief, the Holy Spirit is required for salvation; which includes speaking in tongues. In this group, some Pentecostals churches baptize in the name of Jesus only, and some baptize in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost/spirit.\nPentecostal churches believe that Jesus still heals the sick, with the power of the Holy Spirit.\nThey also believe in other gifts such as speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, supernatural knowledge, mainly about sickness or spiritual matters, and prophesy about future spiritual happenings. Many also practice exorcism, that is, casting out evil spirits.\nStatistics.\nSee also: List of Christian denominations by number of members This list indicates that there may be 150 million Pentecostals.

It is based on five principles:\nThe Basic Roman system serves no particular standard of English pronunciation. Instead, it gives one way to spell the different varieties of English. The system uses 22 Roman letters to represent the set of English phonemes considered by J.C. Wells. The letters \u2018j\u2019, \u2018q\u2019, \u2018w\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 are not used (letters \u2018j\u2019 and \u2018w\u2019 are used in an extended version of the Basic Roman spelling, see below).\nBy way of illustration, the following reference text by V.

The above sample text would appear in Extended Basic Roman (non-rhotic version) as follows:\nApart from respelling of English, the Basic Roman could also be used as the target spelling of a universal algorithm for the designing of superior, user-friendly Romanization systems transliterating and transcribing a variety of languages. This \u2018streamlined approach\u2019 has been successfully tested in the case of Bulgarian language, with the 1995 Streamlined System for the Romanization of Bulgarian becoming established in Bulgaria (eventually codified in a 2009 law), and adopted also by UN in 2012, and for official US and UK use by BGN and PCGN in 2013. Recently this approach has been used to design the 2017 Streamlined System for the Romanization of Russian aimed at replacing the plethora of systems currently occurring in the non-academic practice of transliteration of Russian Cyrillic.\nThe Extended Basic Roman is close to one-to-one phoneme-grapheme correspondence, paving the way to a pronunciation respelling for English by means of the closely related Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English.\nRoman Phonetic Alphabet for English.\nThe Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English is a system based on the Extended Basic Roman spelling of English. It includes two pairs of stress marks which disambiguate words which share the same spelling but have different meanings.

{"id": "61961", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61961", "title": "Ascension", "text": "Ascension is a Christian holiday. The word \"ascension\" means \"going up\". According to the story told in the Bible, Jesus ascended (went up) to heaven. This was seen by his apostles. The holiday is celebrated forty days after his resurrection. The story tells that Jesus' body went to heaven, and that in heaven he sits at the right-hand side of God the Father.\nAscension Day is officially celebrated on a Thursday. However, not all countries hold the feast on this day. It is one of the ecumenical feasts. All Christians celebrate this feast, much like Easter and Pentecost. It is a very important feast in the calendar of the Christian Church.\nIn some countries (at least in Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany (since the 1930s), Haiti, Iceland, Indonesia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Namibia, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Vanuatu) it is a public holiday; Germany also holds its Father's day on the same date. \nThe Eastern churches.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church calculates the date of Easter differently, so the Eastern Orthodox celebration of Ascension will usually be after the western observance (either one week, or four weeks, or five weeks later; but occasionally on the same day). The earliest possible date for the feast is May 13 (of the western calendar), and the latest possible date is June 16. Some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, however, observe Ascension on the same date as the Western Churches.\nThe feast is observed with an all-night vigil.\nTexts in the Bible.\nThe Epistle to the Romans is a book from the Bible which was written about the year 56 or 57. In it, Paul describes Christ as in heaven and in the abyss. This seems to be the earliest Christian reference to Jesus in heaven.\nOne of the most important texts about the \"Ascension\" is in the Acts of the Apostles . According to the two-source hypothesis it is also the earliest. There Jesus is taken up bodily into heaven forty days after his resurrection. The text says that the apostles saw this happening. Before going into heaven, Jesus gave a speech called the Great Commission, in which he said that he would return. In the Gospel of Luke, the \"Ascension\" takes place on Easter Sunday evening. The Gospel of John (c. 90-100) talks about Jesus returning to the Father. In 1 Peter (c. 90-110), Jesus has ascended to heaven and is at God's right side. Ephesians (c. 90-100) refers to Jesus ascending higher than all the heavens. First Timothy (c. 90-140) describes Jesus as taken up in glory. The traditional ending in the Book of Mark (see Mark 16) includes a short version of what Luke had said about the resurrection. It describes Jesus as being taken up into heaven and sitting at God's right hand. The way that Christ's Ascension is described is similar to the general description of his welcome in heaven, a description that comes from Hebrew scripture. The picture of Jesus rising bodily into the heavens fits in with the old traditional idea that heaven was above the earth.\nOther texts about the ascension.\nThere are texts that are not in the Bible that also speak about ascension, for example \"Pistis Sophia\".\nIn his text \"Against Heresies\", Irenaeus tells about the Gnostic view that the Ascension happened eighteen months after the Resurrection. The apocryphal text known as the \"Apocryphon of James\" describes the teachings of Jesus to James and Peter 550 days after the resurrection, but before the ascension. This text suggests an even longer period. The recently discovered Nag Hammadi \"Gospel of Thomas\", like the canonical Gospel of Matthew, does not mention the Ascension.\nHistory.\nThe feast of the Ascension has been celebrated for many centuries. Although we do not have anything in writing about it before the beginning of the fifth century, St. Augustine says that it is of Apostolic origin, and he speaks of it in a way that shows that all Christians celebrated it long before his time (he lived from 354 to 430).\n\"Christ's ascension\" is mentioned in the original Nicene Creed. This text has been important to Christians ever since it was made in 325. It is included in the Mass. It is also mentioned in the Apostles' Creed. It is important for Christian belief because it shows that Jesus' humanity was taken into Heaven. \"Ascension Day\" is one of the chief feasts of the Christian year. There is plenty of evidence that shows that the feast dates back at least to the later 300s.\nThe canonical story of Jesus ascending bodily into the clouds is different from the gnostic tradition, by which Jesus was said to transcend the bodily world and return to his home in the spirit world. It also contrasts with Docetic beliefs, by which matter is basically evil and Jesus was said to have been pure spirit.\nScholars of the historical Jesus think that New Testament accounts of Jesus' resurrection were stories that were invented by the apostolic-era Christian community. Some describe the Ascension as a convenient way to disagree with ongoing appearance claims in the Christian community."}

She died in Arles.\nControversy.\nA study by Russian researcher Nikolay Zak has disputed Jeanne Calment's claimed age with a hypothesis that Jeanne's daughter Yvonne, born 1898 and claimed to have died of pneumonia in 1934, usurped Jeanne's identity upon Jeanne's death in 1934. In that scenario, Jeanne Calment would have died already in 1934 and Yvonne Calment in 1997, claiming to be her mother and aged 122 but in fact she was aged 99. However, to prove if the hypothesis is true, a DNA/blood test is required.\nThe oldest undisputed person in history is American woman Sarah Knauss, who lived to age 119 years, 97 days."}

They find a good place to live, set up their tent for a short time and then move to somewhere else.\nAlthough Islam is the state religion in Mauritania, Nouakchott includes the Cathedral of St. Joseph, a Catholic cathedral.\nNouakchott has a deep-sea port. It was opened in 1986. The port is mainly used for imports. The city also features an international airport. The city is home to the Universit\u00e9 de Nouakchott. It is the only university in Mauritania. Things to see in Nouakchott include Nouakchott Museum, several markets including Nouakchott Silver Market, and the beaches.\nHistory.\nNouakchott has very little history. It was a tiny fishing town until 1958. It is possible that the Berber Muslim Almoravids came from the area. The city was selected as the capital city for its mild climate and its location near the center of the country.\nMauritania was part of the larger French colony of French West Africa. During that time, Saint-Louis, in Senegal was the capital. In 1957, this small port town was chosen to be the capital of the new country. A building program was begun to grow its population to 15,000. In 1962, Nouakchott became the capital of an independent country.\nThe city has much growth. Because of the north African drought since the beginning of the 1970s many people have moved to the city.\nGeography.\nNouakchott is located on the Atlantic coast of the Sahara Desert. The city is very spread out. It has only a few tall buildings.\nNouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Abd an-Nasir. This street runs northeast through the city center from the airport. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian people, or international people of the 1960s: Avenue de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.\nTemperatures range between 33\u00b0C (92\u00b0F) and 13\u00a0\u00b0C (56\u00a0\u00b0F). The average rainfall is 178mm (7in) a year."}

Myra is near Antalya, in modern-day Turkey.\nIn the 11th century, his remains were taken to Bari, Italy, to save them from Turkish (Muslim) invaders. \nHe is the patron saint of very many groups, including thieves and murderers. So far as is known, what he did in that respect was to protect the \"falsely accused\".\nHe is venerated in both Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches.\nLife.\nHis parents were relatively well-off. Nicholas is said to have distributed his fortune among the poor. This is relatively well documented. Less documented deeds of his include saving children from drowning. Nicholas saved young girls from being made prostitutes (because their fathers did not have the money for a dowry). He helped seamen in a storm and saved a child that was abducted.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas of Myra is a very prominent figure. Very often, the third large icon on the Iconostasis in Orthodox churches is devoted to him. The other two are usually devoted to Jesus, and to Mary with the child.\nThe Cantata by Benjamin Britten.\nThe modern composer Benjamin Britten composed a cantata for orchestra and choir about the life of St. Nicholas. It is very popular and often performed.\nIn modern times.\nHe is the Saint behind the legendary character of Santa Claus. He is the patron Saint of Children, of Seafarers and merchants. The Hanseatic League chose him as their patron saint. Over 400 churches and several thousands all over the world are named after Nicholas of Myra. He is also the patron saint of both Amsterdam, capital of Netherlands and Moscow, capital of Russia."}

Models often appear in advertising on television and in print media, for example newspapers and magazines, or on the web.\nFirst model.\nThe first person described to work as a fashion model was Parisian shopgirl, Marie Vernet Worth. She was a 'house' model in 1852, for her fashion designer husband at the \"haute couture\" House of Worth.\nCommercial models.\nThere are many different types of models. Some models only use certain parts of their bodies. For example, a \"hand model\" is a person who only uses their hands. A hand model would be used to display certain items, for example rings and watches. These models are mostly used for advertisements.\nFashion models are used to sell clothing or cosmetics. People who make clothing will often use fashion models to wear the clothing they make at fashion shows. The models will walk up and down a raised section of floor called the catwalk or \"runway\" to show the clothing to other people. Some exclusive 'fashion houses' also use models to show off their dresses to clients. This idea was invented by Charles Worth.\nPhotographers use models for advertising, editorial and personal portfolio work. Work can involve news, fine art, fashion, fitness and glamour. Some photographers may ask models to express different moods or feeling for pictures.\nModels can be all shapes and sizes, both men and women. Models do not have to be size zero, though most are young, good-looking females. There are specialist models for feet, hands and face, all of which may be photographed for various reasons. Some models are \"plus-size\" models and are of a larger build.\nSupermodels.\nA supermodel is a highly paid model who usually has a worldwide reputation. The term \"supermodel\" began being used in the 1980s. Supermodels usually work for top fashion designers and famous clothing brands. They have multimillion-dollar contracts. They also have endorsements and campaigns. They have branded themselves as household names and are recognized worldwide.\nArt models.\nFine art models are hired by photographers, painters, sculptors and other artists to pose for their art.\nModels are frequently used during art classes, but are also employed by professional artists. The most common types of art created using models are figure drawing and painting, sculpture and photography. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in advertising, its 'artwork' commonly employs models.\nThroughout the history of Western art, drawing the human figure from life was considered the best way to develop the skill of drawing. In the art school classroom setting, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, animals etc., against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.\nModels for life drawing classes are often nude, apart from visually non-obstructive personal items such as small jewellery and sometimes eyeglasses. This may be referred to as being 'undraped' or 'disrobed'.\nEmployment.\nModels typically work in one of two ways:"}

{"id": "62050", "revid": "1053893", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62050", "title": "Religion of Ancient Egypt", "text": "The religion of ancient Egypt lasted throughout their civilization. After about three thousand years, the Egyptian people turned to Coptic Christianity and Islam. These religions were brought by influences from outside. Christianity spread across Egypt in the third and fourth centuries AD. After the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the 7th century, most Egyptians were converted to Islam by the 10th century.\nGods.\nAt the beginning, there were five different religious groups of people in Egypt. Each groups had different beliefs, and were based in different places.\nDuring the history of Egypt, the beliefs changed with the leader. When someone rose in power, their belief system rose as well. The new beliefs would combined with the beliefs that were already there. This happened even after the end of the ancient Egyptian civilization as it is known today. An example of this might be the \"New Kingdom\". During its time, the gods Ra and Amun, became Amun-Ra. Joining to create one god is usually referred to as syncretism.\nHistory of the gods.\nThe Egyptians believed that in the beginning, the universe was filled with the dark waters of chaos. The first god, Re-Atum, came from the water. Re-Atum spat and this created the gods Shu (god of air) and Tefnut (goddess of moisture). The world was created when Shu and Tefnut gave birth to two children: Nut (goddess of the sky) and Geb (god of the Earth). Humans were created when Shu and Tefnut went walking in the darkness and got lost. Re-Atum sent his eye to find them. After finding them, his tears of joy turned into people.\nNut and Geb had sex. When Shu heard about this, he did not want them to be together. He became the air between the sky and ground. He also said that the pregnant Nut could not give birth. Nut begged Thoth to help. Thoth gambled with the moon-god Khonsu. He won five more days to be added to the 360-day year. Nut had one child on each of these days: Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys, and Horus-the-Elder.\nOsiris was the king of Egypt. His brother, Seth, murdered him and became the king. After killing him, Seth tore the body of Osiris into pieces. Isis rescued the pieces. She wanted to bury the pieces under the temple. After Seth became king, he was fought by Horus, Osiris's son. Seth lost and was sent to the desert. Seth became the god of horrible storms. Osiris was mummified by Anubis and became God of the dead. Horus became the new king. In ancient Egypt, it was believed that the pharaohs were Horus's descendants.\nThe ancient Greeks believed that Egyptian gods and goddesses were the descendants of their gods and goddesses. In ancient Greek Mythology, when the titan Typhon was set free, all of the Greek gods (except for Hermes and Zeus) fled to Egypt. In Greece, many of the gods made themselves turn into animals to hide themselves from Typhon. \nDeath.\nEgypt had a developed view of the afterlife with rituals for preparing the body and soul for a peaceful life after death. Beliefs about the soul and afterlife focused mainly on preserving the body. This was because they believed that the \"ka\" (a part of a person's soul that was depicted as a bird with a persons head) was still living in the body after death and it was important for the ka to be reunited with the ba, the spirit or soul to form the akh. This meant that embalming and mummification were done, in order to preserve the person's identity in the afterlife. Originally the dead were buried in reed coffins in the hot sand, which caused the remains to dry quickly, and then were buried. Later, they started constructing wooden tombs, and the long process of mummification was developed by the Egyptians around the 4th Dynasty. All soft tissues were removed, and the cavities washed and packed with natron, then the outer body was buried in natron as well. The heart was the only organ left within the body as it was believed the heart had to be weighed in the underworld to see if the person was worthy of a peaceful afterlife. The other organs were placed in 'canopic jars' which had seals depicting the heads of the Gods that guarded the intestines: Imsety,an Egyptian man who guards the liver, Hapi, a baboon who guards the lungs, Duamutef, a jackal who guards the stomach and Qebehsenuef, a falcon who guards the intestines.\nAfter coming out of the natron, the bodies were coated inside and out with resin to preserve them, then wrapped with linen bandages, embedded with religious amulets and talismans. In the case of royalty, this was usually then placed inside a series of nested coffins. The outer layer of the coffins was a stone sarcophagus. Other creatures were also mummified, sometimes thought to be pets of Egyptian families, but more likely they represented the gods. They left the heart in place because they thought it was the home of the soul.\nThe Book of the Dead was a series of almost two hundred spells represented as texts, songs and pictures written on papyrus. They were individually customized for the dead. They were buried along with the dead to make their passage into the underworld easier. After working their way through lakes of fire, spitting cobras, demon jackals and giant bugs their soul is led into a hall of judgment in Duat by Anubis (god of mummification) and the deceased's heart, which was the record of the morality of the owner, is weighed against a single feather representing Ma'at (the concept of truth, and order). A heart that weighed less than the feather was considered a pure heart. This resulted in a good outcome. A heart heavy with guilt and sin from one's life weighed more than the feather, and so the heart would be eaten by Ammit (\"Eater of Hearts\")\u2013part crocodile, part lion, and part hippopotamus. If the outcome was good, the dead are taken to Osiris, god of the afterlife, in Aaru, but the if the out come was bad, the demon Ammit destroyed their heart which killed the soul. The person would then be placed in a special place with food just out of reach of their hands. If they ever got the food, demons would put them into a hole to make it harder for them.\nThe Greeks wrote a myth about a King who was forced to do the same thing but he was imprisoned in a lake. Whenever he bent his head to have some water, the lake would drain away only to bring the water back when he stopped trying. There was also food above his head on a tree and whenever he reached out for it the branch would move away.\nThe monotheistic period.\nA short time of monotheism (Atenism) happened when Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) was pharaoh. He focused the religion on the Egyptian sun god Aten. The Aten is usually shown as a sun disk with rays coming out of all sides. Akhenaten built a new capital at Amarna with temples for The Aten. Akhenaten's religion only lasted until his death. The old religion was quickly restored by Tutankhamun, Akhenaten's son by his wife Kiya.\nWhile most historians say this period is monotheistic, some researchers do not. They say that people worshipped the royal family as gods who got their divine power from the Aten. In one picture, Akhenaten is shown with his wife Nefertiti with three of their 6 daughters sitting under the beams of the Aten. This point of view is mostly ignored by the historians. Some researchers say that Akhenaten or some of his viziers were Moses or Joseph (Bible) from the Bible.\nAfter the fall of the Amarna dynasty, the original Egyptin pantheon was the main religion, until the development Coptic Christianity and later Islam, even though the Egyptians continued to have relations with the other monotheistic cultures (the Hebrews). Egyptian mythology put up surprisingly little resistance to the spread of Christianity. This is sometimes explained by saying that Jesus was originally a syncretism based mainly on Horus, with Isis and her worship becoming Mary."}

Some seedless plants can also be considered annuals even though they do not flower.\nIn gardening, annual often refers to a plant grown outdoors in the spring and summer and surviving just for one growing season. \nMany food plants are, or are grown as, annuals, including most domesticated grains. Some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if they are not considered cold hardy for the local climate. Carrot, celery and parsley are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. Tomato, sweet potato and bell pepper are tender perennials usually grown as annuals.\nOrnamental annuals are often called bedding plants. Annuals are often used in gardens to provide splashes of color, as they tend to have a longer season of bloom than hardy herbaceous perennials.\nExamples of true annuals include corn, lettuce, pea, cauliflower, watermelon, bean, zinnia and marigold.\nSummer annuals.\nSummer annuals sprout, flower and die within the same spring/summer/fall. The lawn weed, crabgrass, is a summer annual."}

This was the original model organism used by Gregor Mendel in his early work on genetics.\nThe name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae like the pigeon pea (\"Cajanus cajan\"), the chickpea, the cowpea (\"Vigna unguiculata\")and the seeds from several species of \"Lathyrus\".\n\"P. sativum\" is an annual plant. It is a cool season crop, planted in winter. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 grams. The species is as a fresh vegetable, but is also grown to produce dry peas like the split pea. These varieties are typically called field peas.\n\"P. sativum\" has been cultivated for thousands of years, the sites of cultivation have been described in southern Syria and southeastern Turkey, and some argue that the cultivation of peas with wheat and barley seems to be associated with the spread of Neolithic agriculture into Europe.\nDescription of \"Pisum Sativum\".\nIt is a cool-season vegetable crop. The seeds may be planted as soon as the soil temperature reaches 10\u00a0\u00b0C, with the plants growing best at temperatures of 13\u00a0\u00b0C to 18\u00a0\u00b0C. They do not thrive in the summer heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates, but do grow well in cooler high altitude tropical areas. Peas grow best in slightly acid, well-drained soils.\nSeed dispersal.\nThe seeds are dispersed when the pod reaches maturity and bursts open. It scatters the peas over as wide a distance as it is possible for the plant.\nDifferent Varieties of Peas.\nSeveral varieties of \"P. sativum\" have been bred. Widely cultivated examples include:\nWays of eating peas.\nFresh peas are often eaten boiled and flavored with butter and/or spearmint as a side dish vegetable. Salt is also commonly added to peas when served. Fresh peas are also used in pot pies, salads and casseroles. Pod peas (particularly sweet cultivars called \"mangetout\" and \"sugar peas\", or the flatter \"snow peas,\" called \"h\u00e9 l\u00e1n d\u00f2u\", \u8377\u5170\u8c46 in Chinese) are used in stir fried dishes, particularly those in American Chinese cuisine. Pea pods do not keep well once picked, and if not used quickly are best preserved by drying, canning or freezing within a few hours of harvest.\nDried peas are often made into a soup or simply eaten on their own. In Japan and other Southeast Asian countries including Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia, the peas are roasted and salted, and eaten as snacks. In the UK, marrowfat peas are used to make pease pudding (or \"pease porridge\"), a traditional dish. In North America a similarly traditional dish is split pea soup.\nIn Chinese cuisine, pea sprouts (\u8c46\u82d7 \"d\u00f2u mi\u00e1o\") are commonly used in stir-fries and its price is relatively high due to its agreeable taste.\nSome forms of etiquette require that peas be only eaten with a fork and not pushed onto the fork with a knife ."}
{"id": "62115", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62115", "title": "Biennial", "text": "A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle. In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures); then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually, the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette. Many biennials require a cold treatment, before they will flower. The next spring/summer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer. The plant then flowers, produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals.\nUnder extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time (e.g. 3 or 4 months instead of 2 years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, before they were planted in the ground. This behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas.\nFlowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone \"gibberellin\", but this is rarely done commercially.\nFrom a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals, e.g. beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, parsley, and Swiss chard. If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions, it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.\nExamples of biennial plants are parsley, \"Lunaria\", silverbeet, sweet William, colic weed, and carrot. The pansy is a biennial often grown as an annual. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. foxglove, stock, and hollyhock.\nBiennials may be kept alive longer than two years under environmental conditions that prevent them from flowering. Biennial sugar beet was prevented from flowering by not giving it the cold treatment required for flowering. It was kept alive in a greenhouse for 41 months."}

The city is a port on the Indian Ocean. It is the largest city and main port of the country. Port Louis is located in the Port Louis District. The city has a population of 147,688 people.\nHistory.\nPort Louis was founded by the French around 1735. It was used as a place to supply food for their ships travelling around the Cape of Good Hope. The city was named in honour of King Louis XV. The first Governor was Count Bertrand-Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais.\nMonuments.\nPort Louis has many historic and colonial buildings. One of them is a fortification named Fort Adelaide or La Citadelle. It was built by the British in 1835. Most of the city's architecture can be seen from La Citadelle. Port Louis is surrounded by a mountain range, called the Port Louis Moka Range. Other famous spots are the Police Barracks known as Les Casernes and the Port Louis Waterfront.\nOther things to see in the city include the Caudan Waterfront, Port Louis Bazaar, the Mauritian Chinatown and the old Port Louis theatre. The capital has also three museums which are: the Mauritius Natural History Museum, the Blue Penny Museum and the Mauritius Stamp Museum.\nEconomy.\nThe main part of the economy of Port Louis is its port. The port handles all of the international trade for the country. Clothing and textiles are the major things manufactured in the city. Chemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals are made there, and tourism is also important. \nPort Louis is the second most important financial center in Africa after Johannesburg. It is the city with the highest per capita income in Africa.\nDemographics.\nThe population of the city is now largely made up of the descendants of people who were hired for labor from India in the 19th century. Slaves were brought to the country by the British and French who colonized the island in the 18th century. After the end of slavery in 1835, many Indian and Chinese workers were brought to work the land, and take care of sugar cane, at that time used to make rum. \nMore than 75 percent of the population are Indians. The rest come from Africa, while a small number have Chinese and Eurasian ancestry."}

With a population of 951,000 people, it is the largest city in that country. The city is a port on the Freetown Peninsula on the Atlantic coast. The port is a very important part of the economy of Freetown. It handles the main exports of the country. Industries include fish, rice, petroleum, and making cigarettes.\nHistory.\nThe area was first settled in 1787 by 400 freed former slaves and Black American Loyalists sent from London. Many of these men had joined the British Army because the British promised to free them if they fought the American colonists. Before that time it was said to be a slave market. These people created the 'Province of Freetown' on land bought from local Temne leaders. After many of these original settlers died from disease, it was burnt by the local people in 1790.\nThe Sierra Leone Company tried to settle the area again in 1792. They resettled Freetown with 1,100 former slaves and Loyalists from Nova Scotia. Many of these people were born in the colonial United States. They were led by former slave Thomas Peters. Around 500 free Jamaican Maroons joined them in 1800.\nThe city survived being attacked by the French in 1794. In 1800 the people revolted but the British retook control. From 1808 to 1874, the city was the capital of British West Africa. The city grew quickly as many freed slaves came to live there. African soldiers who had fought for Britain in the Napoleonic Wars also came to live in Freetown. During World War II, Britain had a naval base at Freetown. Descendants of the freed slaves, called Creoles, have a large role in the city, even though they are only a small amount of the population.\nThe city had much fighting in the late 1990s. In 1998, it was captured by ECOWAS soldiers who were trying to make Ahmad Tejan Kabbah the President again.\nFeatures.\nOne of Freetown\u2019s most most known features is its famous cotton tree. The cotton tree is said to have been in the same position since colonists came to the area in 1787. At that time, the tree was still a young sapling. It now stands outside the Freetown Museum.\nNotable buildings in the city include Freetown Law Courts, the Slave Gate and Portuguese Steps, St John's Maroon Church (built around 1820), St George's Cathedral (completed in 1828), Foulah Town Mosque (built in the 1830s) and the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Cathedral. Also in Freetown are many beaches and markets, and the Sierra Leone Museum.\nThe city is the home of Fourah Bay College and the Njala University college.\nLungi International Airport is the international airport of Sierra Leone. Freetown also has a heliport on Aberdeen Island. It connects the city with the airport. There is a helicopter, hovercraft and ferry-service from the city to the airport."}

The peace treaty which ended the war was signed in Pretoria on August 3, 1881 at the Pretoria Convention.\nThe Second Boer War (1899 to 1902) caused the end of the South African Republic. After this war, the United Kingdom took control of South Africa. During the war, Winston Churchill was imprisoned in the Staats Model School in Pretoria. He later got free and went to Mozambique. The city surrendered to British forces on June 5, 1900. The war ended in Pretoria with the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging on May 31 1902.\nIn 1910, Pretoria then became the administrative capital of all of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal. On 14 October 1931, Pretoria got official city status. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria stayed its administrative capital.\nPretoria was at one time seen as \"the capital of Apartheid South Africa\". This was changed when Nelson Mandela became the country's first black President.\nEconomy.\nPretoria is an important industrial centre. It has many industries including iron and steel as well as automobile, railroad and machinery manufacture."}

For example, an outspoken member of a political party who blocks those with opposing views, would be a prime example of a \u2018\u2019bigot\u2019\u2019.\nThe origin of the word \"bigot\" in English dates back to at least 1598, via French. It started with the sense of \"religious hypocrite\", especially a woman.\nThe word \"bigot\" is often used as a pejorative term against a person who is obstinately devoted to negative prejudices, even when those prejudices are proven to be false.\nForms of bigotry may have a related ideology.\nEtymology.\nThe exact origin of the word is unknown, but may have come from the German \"bei\" and \"gott\", or the English \"by God\". William Camden wrote that the Normans were first called bigots, when their Duke Rollo, who receiving Gisla, daughter of King Charles, in marriage, and with her the investiture of the dukedom, refused to kiss the king's foot in token of subjection, unless the king would hold it out for that purpose. And being urged to it by those present, Rollo answered hastily, \"No by God\", whereupon the king turning about, called him \"bigot\"; which name passed from him to his people. This is likely fictional, however, as Gisla is unknown in Frankish sources."}

In North America, steaks are usually grilled. They are also often pan fried or baked. The most tender (softest) cuts of the animal are usually used for steak. This also means that steaks have a high price. The pieces of meat used for steaks are usually cut across the muscle fiber, not along it. This makes them look more tender.\nA restaurant that mainly makes steaks is known as a steakhouse. A well-known side dish to steak is prawns or a cooked lobster tail. This combination is often called \"surf and turf\" or \"reef and beef\" (the words \"surf\" and \"reef\" refer to the seafood and \"turf\" and \"beef\" refer to the steak). Special steak knives are used to cut steak. A steak knife is sharper than most table knives and is usually serrated.\nFish is not the only side dish for steak. Other common side dishes are baked potatoes, dinner rolls, salad, and corn on the cob. In France, steaks are often served with french fries. This combination is known as \"steak fries\" or \"steak-frites\". They do not come with vegetables, but sometimes a salad is served with them.\nSeasoning.\nSteaks are seasoned with salt and black pepper. Some additional seasonings are garlic, rosemary, and other herbs and spices. Marinades are also an option depending on the cut. Butter can also be used for basting steaks for a milky flavor.

His reign is dated as 1353\u20131336 BC or 1351\u20131334 BC.\nAkhenaten is one of Egypt's most well-known pharaohs.\nIn the fifth year of his reign, he changed his name from Amenhotep IV, meaning \"Amun is satisfied\". He did this because he left Egypt's traditional polytheism. He founded a monotheistic worship of the Egyptian sun god, Aten. He destroyed the temples of Amun. His new religion was called Atenism. It was the first known attempt at monotheism in the world. Naturally, this made enemies of the many priests of the old religion. \nThis culture shift away from traditional religion was not widely accepted. This helps to explain why after his death, his monuments were dismantled, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from lists of rulers compiled by later pharaohs. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, notably under his close successor Tutankhamun, who changed his name from Tutankhaten early in his reign. However, it was Horemheb who destroyed all the works of Akhenaten.\nAkhenaten was all but lost to history until the late 19th century discovery of Amarna, the new capital city he built for the worship of Aten. \nIts rediscovery and Flinders Petrie's early excavations sparked great public interest in the pharaoh and his queen Nefertiti. The interest comes from his connection with Tutankhamun, the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and interest in the religion he attempted to establish."}

She is known as the singer of the group the Carpenters.\nKaren had anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder of extreme weight loss dieting. This was a little-known illness at the time. Although she had begun recovery with a doctor-supervised program and regained 30\u00a0lbs (14\u00a0kg), permanent damage to her body had been sustained from the years of extreme weight-loss dieting and she died at the age of 32. The cause of her death was heart failure, from complications related to her illness which caused her to believe mistakenly that she needed to lose weight.\nEarly life.\nKaren Carpenter was born at Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut on March 2, 1950 to Agnes Reuwer Tatum and Harold Bertram Carpenter. She played baseball a lot, and said that she liked being the pitcher. She had a brother, named Richard Carpenter. While Karen played baseball with her friends, Richard usually played the piano. Her parents, Agnes and Harold Carpenter, decided that they wanted to move to Downey, California, a city near Hollywood. They moved in 1963.\nIn Downey, Karen attended Downey High School. She was a good student, but did not like gym. In order to get out of gym, she asked to be in the marching band instead. When she got into the marching band, the director gave her the glockenspiel, an instrument that sounds somewhat like a xylophone. Karen did not like the glockenspiel and asked her band director if she could play the drums instead. Seeing Karen's natural talent for rhythm, the director approved. From then on, she practiced drumming on pots and pans before her parents finally bought her a drum set.\nHer brother formed the Richard Carpenter Trio in 1965. Karen played the drums. Richard played the piano, and a friend named Wes Jacobs played the electric bass. They played jazz music at clubs in Hollywood. They entered the Battle of the Bands contest at the Hollywood Bowl in 1966. The Richard Carpenter Trio played \"The Girl From Ipanema\" and \"Iced Tea,\" a song composed by Richard Carpenter. They won the Battle of the Bands that year. Afterwards, they signed with RCA Records, but the RCA thought their music would not sell, so RCA let them go. The Richard Carpenter Trio made one last TV appearance on \"Your All American College Show\" in 1968, where they played \"Dancing in the Street.\" Karen had a great drum solo. They won the \"Your All American College Show\" contest, too.\nIn 1967, Richard and Karen formed another group called Spectrum. Spectrum focused on making big harmonies, and the public did not like their music. Both the Richard Carpenter Trio and Spectrum disbanded in 1968.\nCareer.\nAfter five years of going nowhere, Richard and Karen Carpenter wanted to sign with a record label, but were constantly rejected. Joe Osborn, a bass player, had recording studio and let Richard and Karen record demo tapes. They sent in those demo tapes to a man named Herb Alpert. Herb Alpert appreciated Richard and Karen's music, and agreed to sign the two to his record label, A&amp;M Records.\nIn April 1969, Richard and Karen Carpenter signed to A&amp;M Records as \"Carpenters.\" They released their first album that year as well. It was called \"Offering.\" It did not have any popular songs on there, except for a song called \"Ticket to Ride.\" When they released it as a single, the public's reaction was somewhat less than great. Too many people were accustomed to the Beatles' version.\nThe next year, Herb Alpert recommended a song called \"(They Long to Be) Close to You.\" After being given the music, Richard Carpenter worked on arranging it to invent their own sound. This song was their first major hit. It went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nLater that year, the Carpenters recorded another song, called \"We've Only Just Begun.\" It was originally for a commercial for a bank called \"Crocker Bank\", but Richard saw potential in it. He again began working on the arrangement and the song was released. Ultimately, \"We've Only Just Begun\" released it as a single, went to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThroughout their career, Karen and Richard continued to be successful and release great singles. All of them placed in the top 20 until 1977. In 1977, both singles released only peaked at #32 and #35. Their last top 20 released in 1981 \"Touch Me When We're Dancing\" peaked at #16. This was seen as a successful \"come back\" for the Carpenters however Karen would pass away just two years later.\nKaren also recorded her first and only solo album entitled \"Karen Carpenter\" in 1979-1980 while her brother Richard took time off to recover from an addiction to prescription sleeping pills. The album was not released during Karen's lifetime and would remain the A&amp;M vaults until 1996 when Richard Carpenter finally felt the time was right to release it. Karen dedicated her solo to her brother \"Dedicated to my brother Richard... With all my heart...\" Karen's fans have had a mixed reaction to her solo album but the majority believe the album was strong enough to be released at the time that it was recorded and would have had few strong hits for the singer. However Karen choose to shelve the album after it was negatively received by the powers that be at A&amp;M Records and her brother.\nAnorexia Nervosa.\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder. It is a physiological disorder that is characterized by undereating, due to an inaccurate body image. Victims of this disorder are typically perfectionists that have trouble showing their emotions. Karen Carpenter's eating disorder started in 1967, when the group \"Spectrum\" was still playing. Because she was moderately overweight, her doctor advised her to lose weight. Her doctor then suggested a diet called the \"Stillman Diet.\" She drank 8 cups of water everyday and avoided high calorie foods. Karen lost about 25 pounds from the Stillman Diet. After she became successful, she decided that she needed to lose more weight. In 1975, she lost so much weight that she became ill. At one time, she was only 80 pounds and 5'4\" tall (five feet, four inches). A woman her height should be between 124 and 138 pounds. Becoming aware of her illness, she decided to gain weight. In 1982, she was the healthiest she'd been, but her heart failed. It's been proven that she had been abusing laxatives and thyroid pills. She may have also abused syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting, but that has not been proven. On February 4, 1983, Karen Carpenter died at the age of 32 from heart failure.\nRecords.\nWith the Carpenters, Karen Carpenter had a lot of records. Here is a list of them. The \"italicized\" words are the names of the records, and the things in the (parentheses) are the years that the records were released."}

Irenaeus, Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome say that he was a friend of Saint Paul and a doctor, and that he accompanied Paul on some of his travels. These people also say that he was of Greek origin, from Antioch in Syria.\nModern-day scholars think that the person that wrote the two books was not the same that accompanied Paul. Paul had a theology that was special, and slightly different from that of other writers of the New Testament. The two books written by Luke never refer to this theology. Also, the name of Paul's companion is never linked to writing the two books. The Acts of the Apostles often tell things about Paul which Paul does not tell himself in his letters. \nLuke wrote about the Three Wise Men who visited Jesus in the Bible. Luke never said there were 3 wise men, only wise men from the east."}

It is sometimes a joke term in American politics, and sometimes a realistic one. It is usually said about the possibility of Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories becoming part of the United States. When used to refer to other countries, it is a joke, usually about Canada. There have been attempts by people in the United States to get Canada to join them (like in the Articles of Confederation), but Canada has never taken up these offers. It is also sometimes used to refer to countries that seem to be controlled by the United States. Before the year 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii became states, the sentence \"the 49th state\" was used.\nPlaces in the United States that are not states right now that might become the 51st state are the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands. Besides admitting a new state, another type of proposal has been to form a 51st (or even 52nd) state by dividing a current state, such as the most-populous state (and third-largest state, geographically) of California into two or even three states, or Texas (the second-most populous) into four or five states. , \nSome regions of the U.S. that include land that is now in two different states and might become a new state include the \"State of Jefferson\" (Northmost California plus the southern counties of Oregon) and the \"State of Lincoln\" (Eastmost Washington State plus the northern panhandle of Idaho. A move has also been proposed to separate the westmost one-fourth of Nebraska from that state, but to add that to Wyoming (the least-populous state), rather than to create an entirely new state. This region is actually much closer to Cheyenne, Wyoming, the capital city, than it is to its current capital of Lincoln, Nebraska. \nIn 2012 and more recently in 2017, the people of Puerto Rico voted strongly in favor of becoming the 51st state, but the approval of the United States Congress is also needed.\nGuyana has also seen political movement favoring and advocating for it to become an American associated territory with eventual statehood as its goal.\nSeveral Canadian Provinces as well as the whole of Canada have had political party\u2019s and movements advocating American statehood making their North American location a natural candidate and ideal prospect.

It is also the largest city in that country. It is located in the coastal Banadir region on the Somali Sea. The city has been an important port for the region for many centuries. Estimates of the city's population are between 1.5 and 3 million people.\nMogadishu has had many years of fighting between militias. This is because the government of Somalia fell in 1991.\nHistory.\nTrade between the people in the Mogadishu area with other areas along the Somali Sea coast of Africa started as early as the 1st century. Muslim traders from the Arabian Peninsula came to the area during the 10th century. Because of trade with them, Islam spread through Somalia. The Portuguese tried to take control of the city, but failed. In 1871 Barghash bin Said, the sultan of Zanzibar, controlled the city.\nIn 1892, Ali bin Said let Italy use the city. Italy bought the city in 1905. They made \"Mogadiscio\" (Italian for Mogadishu) the capital of Italian Somaliland. The Italians took control of the area around the city in 1919 after minor resistance. Italian Mogadiscio from a small village of 1,000 inhabitants in the 1890s to a modern capital in 1940 of nearly 100,000 persons (of whom more than 1/3 were Italians), that was second only to Asmara in Eritrea for development inside the Italian Empire.\nBritish forces that were in Kenya during World War II captured Mogadishu on February 26, 1941. The British ruled until they gave Italy control of the city again in 1952. Somalia became independent in 1960 with Mogadishu as its capital.\nRebel forces entered and took the city in 1990. They forced President Mohamed Siad Barre to resign and leave the country in January 1991. He went to Lagos, Nigeria. Some of the rebels said that Ali Mahdi Muhammad was the new president. Others said that Mohamed Farrah Aidid was president. A group of United States Marines landed near Mogadishu on December 9, 1992. They were the first part of the United Nations peacekeeping forces during Operation Restore Hope to go to the country.\nEconomy.\nMogadishu is a commercial and financial center for Somalia. The economy got better after the Somali Civil War but there are still problems. Because there is no government, there is free trade without taxes or regulatory costs. This makes businesses not cost as much as it does in other places. Businesses have hired armed militias to have security. This is causing less violence in the city.\nThe main industries of the city include making food and beverages as well as textiles. The main textile is cotton. The main market many different types of goods from food to electronic items.\nMogadishu has the most port traffic of any port in Somalia. It is still a major seaport. However, there is much piracy around Somalia's coastal areas. This makes trade risky."}

Niscosia is on the Pedieos (Kanlidere) river in the centre of the island. The city is the seat of government as well as the main business centre for Cyprus. Nicosia is capital of the administrative district (Nicosia District).\nDivision.\nNicosia is the only divided capital city in the world. It has a northern (Turkish) section and a southern (Cypriot) section. These sections are divided by the \"Green Line\". It is a demilitarized zone created by the United Nations. Nicosia (southern part) is the capital of the Republic of Cyprus while northern part is capital of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a de facto state only recognized by Turkey. \nNicosia has a total population of 310,355.\nFeatures.\nNicosia has many shops, restaurants and entertainment. The city is a trade center. It manufactures textiles, leather, pottery, plastic, and other items. Copper mines are nearby. The University of Cyprus (UCY) is in Nicosia.\nClimate.\nNicosia has a hot semi-arid climate (\"BSh\" in the Koeppen climate classification).\nHistory.\nNicosia was a city-state known as Ledra or Ledrae in ancient times. The king of Ledra was Onasagoras in 672 BC. The city was rebuilt by Lefkos, son of Ptolemy I around 300 BC. Ledra in Hellenic and Roman times was a small, unimportant town, also known as Lefkothea. It got its first Christian bishop, Trifillios, in 348.\nThe city became the island's capital around the 10th century. It had grown in importance because of threats to the coastal cities Paphos and Salamis. These threats made many people leave the coast of the island and move to Lefkosia in the center of the island.\nThe city became a Venetian possession in 1489. It was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1571. During this time, the city grew culturally. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many palaces, churches and monasteries were built. About 20,000 people living in the city died because of the Ottoman attack of 1570.\nMany disasters happened in the city during the 19th century. Cholera hit the city in 1835. Fire destroyed large parts of Nicosia in 1857. \nThe British Empire took control of the island in 1878. Nicosia was the capital of the new British colony.\nIn early 1974, a coup d'\u00e9tat instigated by the Greek junta overthrew the legal government and took control. Shortly afterwards Turkey invaded the island occupying a large part, with excuse that Turkish Cypriot people's safety was threatened. Because of this, Cyprus and the city of Nicosia are divided since. Cyprus with its legal government is part of the European Union. The northern area, controlled by Turkish Cypriots, exists as a unilaterally proclaimed \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\" recognized only by Turkey. "}

This motto is most often reiterated within the school. The current Headmaster is Tim O'Connor. \nHistory.\nAuckland Grammar School was first set up in 1868 by Sir George Grey. He was the governor of New Zealand from 1861-1868. During that time, the new European settlers were fighting with the M\u0101ori people over land rights issues. The Governor of New Zealand asked for military help from the British Empire. Britain sent up to one million soldiers to New Zealand to end the problems.

The city is in the South Hampton Roads area on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the largest city in Virginia. It is the 42nd largest city in the United States. There are people living there.\nVirginia Beach is a part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News metropolitan area. The area also includes the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Suffolk, as well as other smaller cities, counties and towns of Hampton Roads. The area is known as \"America's First Region.\"\nVirginia Beach is best known as a resort town. It has miles of beaches and hundreds of hotels, motels, and restaurants along the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay. It is also home to several state parks, three military bases, a number of large corporations, and two universities. It was the site of the first landing of English colonists going to Jamestown.\nThe city is listed in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as having the longest pleasure beach in the world and. It is also at the southern end of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, the longest bridge-tunnel in the world.\nHistory.\nNative Americans.\nChesepians were the Native American (American Indian) people living in the area now known as South Hampton Roads in Virginia during the time the English settlers came in 1607. They lived in an area which is now the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake and Virginia Beach.\nThe Chesepians had two other towns (or villages), Apasus and Chesepioc. Both were near the Chesapeake Bay in what is now Virginia Beach. Archaeologists and other people have found many Native American artifacts, for example arrowheads, stone axes, pottery, beads, and skeletons in the area.\nFirst landing, Adam Thoroughgood.\nIn 1607, after traveling by ocean for 144 days, three ships headed by Captain Christopher Newport came to land where the Atlantic Ocean meets the southern mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. This point is in the northeastern part of the city. They named it Cape Henry, after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, the oldest son of King James I of England. They then left the area to find a place farther inland where ships from other European countries would not find them. They created their first settlement at Jamestown. \nAdam Thoroughgood (1604-1640) of Norfolk, England is one of the first Englishmen to settle in the area which became Virginia Beach.\nIn 1634, the Colony was divided into shires. They were soon renamed counties. It is said that Thoroughgood used the name of his home in England when helping name New Norfolk County in 1637. The following year, New Norfolk County was split into Upper Norfolk County (soon renamed Nansemond County) and Lower Norfolk County. Thoroughgood chose to live along the Lynnhaven River, also named for his home in England. Lower Norfolk County was very big. It stretched all the way from the Atlantic Ocean west past the Elizabeth River. It included the entire area that is now the cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.\nPrincess Anne County: 1691-1963.\nIn 1691, Lower Norfolk County was divided to form Norfolk County to the west and Princess Anne County to the east. Princess Anne included all the area from North Carolina border to Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay along the Atlantic Ocean. Princess Anne County existed from 1691 to 1963, over 250 years.\nVirginia Beach: growth of a resort.\nThe small resort area of Virginia Beach began to grow in Princess Anne County in the late 19th century. This growth was helped in 1888 when rail service and electricity started in the area.\nThe resort was dependent upon railroad and electric trolley service at first. The concrete Virginia Beach Boulevard from Norfolk to the Oceanfront was completed in 1922. It let people get to the oceanfront in automobiles, buses, and trucks. The resort of Virginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906. Over the next 45 years, Virginia Beach became more popular as a summer vacation spot. Virginia Beach became a small independent city in 1952. It was politically independent from Princess Anne County. In 1963, Virginia Beach and Princess Anne county merged into a new, much larger independent city keeping the name of the Virginia Beach resort.\nOn May 31, 2019, there was a mass shooting in the city. A man killed 12 people. He was killed by police.\nGeography and climate.\nGeography.\nVirginia Beach has an area of 1,288.1 km\u00b2 (497.3 mi\u00b2). Of that area, 643.1\u00a0km\u00b2 (248.3\u00a0mi\u00b2) is land and 645.0\u00a0km\u00b2 (249.0\u00a0mi\u00b2) is water. The average elevation is 12 feet (4 meters) above sea level.\nThe city has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\" in the Koeppen climate classification).\nThings to see.\nThe Edgar Cayce Hospital for Research and Enlightenment was started in Virginia Beach in 1928 with 60 beds. Cayce was a psychic from Kentucky who said he had healing abilities and made prophesies. Cayce lived in Virginia Beach until he died in 1945. His followers are still active in Virginia Beach. Atlantic University was opened by Cayce in 1930; it closed two years later but was re-opened in 1985. Atlantic University was originally intended for study of Cayce's readings and research after spiritual subjects.\nThere are also eleven golf courses open to the public in the city, as well as four country club courses and NAS Oceana's Aeropines course. Among the best-known public courses are Hell's Point Golf Club and the TPC of Virginia Beach.\nMilitary bases.\nVirginia Beach is home to several United States Military bases. These include the United States Navy's NAS Oceana and FTC Dam Neck, and the United States Army's Fort Story at Cape Henry. NAB Little Creek is mostly in the city of Virginia Beach but has a Norfolk address.\nNAS Oceana is the largest employer in Virginia Beach. It is said to the largest naval airbase in the world.\nSister cities.\nVirginia Beach has three Sister Cities:"}

The title refers to Satanic verses. This is one of the interpretations of the Koran. This interpretation is what Ibn Ishaq did in the oldest surviving text of the work. Some Islamic and most non-Muslim Western historians and commentators on the Qur'an have accepted this story of Muhammad's momentary acceptance of the verses although there are no known sources confirming the presence of these verses in reality in Qur'an in olden times. A common Muslim viewpoint is that the existence of the verses is just a fabrication created by non-Muslims.\nThe novel caused much controversy when it was published. Many Muslims felt that it contained blasphemous references. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, a Shi'a Muslim scholar, issued a fatwa that called for the death of Rushdie and claimed that it was the duty of every Muslim to obey. As a result, Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese language translator of the book was stabbed to death on 11 July 1991; Ettore Capriolo, the Italian language translator, was seriously injured in a stabbing the same month. William Nygaard, the publisher in Norway, survived an attempted assassination in Oslo in October 1993. On 14 February 2006, the Iranian state news agency reported that the fatwa will remain in place permanently.\nIn the United Kingdom, however, the book was praised by a lot of critics. It was a 1988 Booker Prize Finalist, eventually losing to Peter Carey's \"Oscar and Lucinda\"."}

{"id": "62583", "revid": "656019", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62583", "title": "Kanji", "text": "Kanji (\u6f22\u5b57) is one of the three forms of Japanese writing. A kanji is an \"ideogram\": that is, a type of simple picture. These are made to show a word's meaning. It is a symbol of an idea such as an object, thing or quality.\nKanji ideograms (or \u201ccharacters\u201d) were taken from Chinese characters, and many changed over time. The word \u201ckanji\u201d means \u201cHan characters\u201d (i.e. \u201cChinese characters\u201d).\n\"Kanji\" vs. \"kana\".\nThere are two other systems used to write in Japanese. These systems are called hiragana and katakana (together they are called \u201ckana\u201d). They show how a word is pronounced because each character stands for a syllable (a, ka, sa, ta etc.). Each kanji could also be written in kana, indeed they are in children\u2019s books or books for foreigners learning Japanese. \nJapanese can have many homophones for one pronunciation, e.g. \"kami\" can mean \u201cgod\u201d, \u201chair\u201d, \"paper\", or \"upper stream\". Since each words is made of the same syllables, they are written using the same kana (\u304b\u307f in hiragana and \u30ab\u30df in katakana), but since they all have very different meanings, the kanji character for each word is quite different. The kanji for \"god\" is \u795e, the kanji for \"hair\" is \u9aea, the kanji for \"paper\" is \u7d19, and the kanji for \"upper stream\" is \u4e0a. However, each kanji character can have several different pronunciations, according to which meaning (which \u201creading\u201d) is intended.\nKanji was originally written to look like what it means, thus the Japanese symbol for mouth is \u53e3 (which is said as \"kuchi\"), and looks like a mouth. Another word, \u5c71 (said as \"yama\") means mountain. The Japanese have for many words. Many can be shown with just one kanji, but sometimes two kanji characters are combined to make new words, such as \u5c71\u53e3 (\"yamaguchi\"), \"mountain-mouth\", meaning a cave. (It is also a surname and the name of a prefecture).\nKanji is often combined with hiragana to show the grammatical meaning of the word. In English this would be done with endings (e.g. \u201cact\u201d (the verb), \u201caction\u201d (the noun) etc.)\n\"Kun-yomi\" vs. \"on-yomi\".\nMost kanji characters can be pronounced at least two different ways according to whether the word is a native Japanese word (this is called the \u201ckun\u201d reading, or \u201ckun-yomi\u201d), or whether it came from Chinese (this called the \u201con\u201d reading or \u201con-yomi\u201d). Kanji that stand alone usually have kun-yomi, while kanji compound words usually have on-yomi. For example, \u5c71 on its own is \"yama\" (the Japanese word for \u201cmountain\u201d). When it is combined with another word or name, it is pronounced \"san\" e.g. \u201cFuji-san\u201d (Mount Fuji). \nHowever, there are many exceptions to these patterns. For example, some native Japanese words with two or more kanji (usually proper nouns) use their kanji's kun-yomi, like \u5c71\u53e3, which is pronounced \"yama-guchi\", even though the on-yomi for the kanji would be \"san\" and \"k\u014d\" in that order. Sometimes, kanji only have on-yomi and have no kun-yomi. For example, the kanji \u6bd2, which means \"poison\", only has the on-yomi \"doku\". Sometimes, compound words mix on-yomi and kun-yomi together. For example, the word \u91d1\u8272, which means \"golden\", is pronounced \"kin-iro\", in which the first kanji uses its on-yomi, and the second-kanji uses its kun-yomi. Sometimes, the kanji in certain compound words may not even use their kanji readings at all, but are used only to show the word's meaning. For example, the word \u7159\u8349 is pronounced \"tabako\", which means \"tobacco\" in English. This word was borrowed from Portuguese, and while the pronunciation of the word does not match either kanji, the meaning of the kanji are \"smoke\" and \"grass\" in that order, hinting at the word's meaning. There are even some words whose kanji can be used to only show a word's pronunciation and not its meaning. These are called ateji. For example, the word \u4e9c\u7c73\u5229\u52a0, which means \"America\", is pronounced \"Amerika\", but none of the kanji meanings have any obvious connection to America. Usually, however, words of the last kind are usually written in only katakana these days, though sometimes words like \"sushi\" still written in ateji, like \u5bff\u53f8, because Chinese tourists will recognize the ateji more easily, since the word is written the same way in Chinese.\nNumber of kanji.\nKanji characters are classed on the basis of how many brush strokes they are made of. The simplest kanji have one stroke and the most complex may have up to 30 strokes.\nThere are many different Kanji, the exact number is not known but it is around 50,000. However, not all 50,000 are taught in schools. The government of Japan has set up a 1,945 basic kanji list (J\u014dy\u014d Kanji) that those learning the language need to know. They are the ones most commonly used in newspapers and magazines, along with street signs and store signs. Kanji takes many years to learn. By the end of his school years a pupil should know about 1,850 kanji. A university graduate would need to know about 3000. If someone does not know the kanji for a word, they can write it in kana and it will be understood, but it is usually not the proper way to write it, however kana can have many meanings for the same word, so unless the person writes in kanji, we will not know what they are saying.

A libretto can also be the words for an oratorio, cantata, mass or a musical. The person who writes the libretto is called a librettist. The word \u201clibretto\u201d (plural: \u201clibretti\u201d or \u201clibrettos\u201d) is an Italian word which means \u201clittle book\u201d.\nSometimes a composer writes his own libretti, but usually a composer likes to have a librettist who can write the words for him so that he can set them to music.\nSome libretti are original stories by the librettist, but very often they are based on a book by another writer.\nIn the 18th century Metastasio was a very famous librettist. Many of his libretti were set several times by different composers. Another 18th century librettist was Lorenzo da Ponte, who wrote the libretti for three of Mozart's greatest operas, as well as for many other composers. In the 19th century Eug\u00e8ne Scribe wrote a very large number of libretti that were set to music by composers such as Meyerbeer, Auber, Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini and Verdi. Two French writers called Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy wrote many opera and operetta libretti for the composers Jacques Offenbach, Jules Massenet and Georges Bizet. Arrigo Boito, who wrote libretti for, among others, Giuseppe Verdi and Amilcare Ponchielli, composed two operas of his own. Hugo von Hoffmansthal wrote libretti for Richard Strauss.\nWagner and Tippett are two composers who wrote their own libretti.\nUsually a libretto is written before the music, but sometimes composers wrote some of the music first and then looked for words to go with it. Composers, such as Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Serov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Puccini, and Mascagni all did this sometimes.\nMusicals usually have lyrics (the words for the songs), and a separate \"book\" ( the spoken dialogue and the stage directions). Sometimes these two are by different authors, e.g. the musical Fiddler on the Roof has a composer (Jerry Bock), a lyricist (Sheldon Harnick), and the writer of the \"book\" (Joseph Stein)."}

It was designed by John Francis Bentley and is in the style of Byzantine church architecture. The nave is the widest of any church in England. The sanctuary is higher than the nave, so that the altar can be seen from any part of the nave. A very large crucifix hangs from the chancel arch. The Archiepiscopal Throne or cathedra, of marble and mosaic, is modelled on the Papal Throne at the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. There are beautiful marble pillars which are all carved differently. In the crypt there are monuments to famous people.\nWestminster Cathedral has a famous choir. The first Master of Music (choirmaster) was Sir Richard Runciman Terry. Since 2000, the Master of Music has been Martin Baker. Mass is sung every day.\nThe choir are famous for singing Gregorian chant and polyphony of the Renaissance. Composers such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams have written music for the choir.\nAll the boys of the Choir are boarders at the nearby Westminster Cathedral Choir School.\nThe organ is very large. It is in the west gallery (above the entrance). It was built by the organ builder Henry Willis III from 1922 to 1932. One of Louis Vierne's best-known organ pieces, \"Carillon de Westminster,\" was composed for it and dedicated to the builder.\nOn 28 May 1982, the first day of his six-day visit to the United Kingdom, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in the Cathedral.\nIn 1995, Cardinal Basil Hume invited HM The Queen. This was the first visit of a reigning monarch of the United Kingdom to a Catholic liturgy since 1688 when James II &amp; VII was king."}

{"id": "62612", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62612", "title": "Median", "text": "In probability theory and statistics, the median of a data set \"formula_1\", sometimes written as formula_2, is a number describing the data set. This number has the property that it divides a set of observed values in two equal halves, so that half of the values are below it and half are above.\nIf there are a finite number of elements, the median is easy to find. The values need to be arranged in a list, from the lowest to highest. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the one at position formula_3. For example, if there are 13 values, they can be arranged into two groups of 6, with the median in between, at position 7. With an even number of values, as there is no single number which divides all of the numbers to two halves, the median is defined as the mean of the two central elements. With 14 observations, this would be the mean of the elements at positions 7 and 8, which is their sum divided by 2.\nAlternatively, the median of an even-sized list is sometimes defined as either of the two middle elements; the choice being either (a) always the smallest one, (b) always the largest one, or (c) randomly choose between the two. This alternative definition has two important advantages: it guarantees that the median is always a list element (for example. a list of integers will never have a fractional median), and it guarantees that the median exists for any ordinal-valued data. On the other hand, when one of the choices (a) or (b) is taken, the median of a sample will be biased, which is an unwanted property of a statistical estimator. Definition (c) does not have that disadvantage, but it is more difficult to do. It also has the disadvantage that the same list of values does not have a well-defined, deterministic median.\nMedian and mean.\nMedian and mean are different in several ways. Mean is a better measure in many cases, because many of the statistical tests can use mean and standard deviation of two observations to compare them, while the same comparison cannot be performed using the medians.\nMedian is more useful when the variance of the values is not important, and we only need a central measure of the values. If the maximum value of a set of numbers changes while the other numbers of this set are kept the same, the mean of this set of numbers changes, but the median does not.\nAnother advantage of median is that it can be calculated sooner when we are studying survival data. For example, a researcher can calculate the median survival of patients with a kidney transplant, when half the patients participated in his study die. Calculating the mean survival requires continuing the study, and following all the patients until their death.\nExample.\nSuppose one wants to know how many jelly beans most people in the room have, and that there are five people in the room:\nThe results change a lot for numbers with larger ranges. Suppose that one has the following group of five people:\nIn this second case, the mean gives a poor understanding of how many jelly beans most people have (10 or less), while the median gives a better idea of the number of jelly beans most people have. To divide up the number of jelly beans equally, however, one would use the mean. The median is basically the middle number."}

By 1920 it had grown to the point where it was decided to officially make it a city. Being at the head of Cook Inlet it became an important place for shipping in Alaska because ships could load and unload cargo to and from the new railroad. In the 1940 an both the army and the air force built bases near Anchorage, and it got even bigger. In 1964 Anchorage was hit by the Good Friday Earthquake, the second strongest earthquake ever recorded. Over a hundred people died and a lot of buildings in and around Anchorage were destroyed. Over the next few years a lot of work went into rebuilding the city and making the buildings better in case there was another earthquake. In 1968 oil was discovered up in the Arctic region of Alaska, and Anchorage again got bigger quickly and merged with other towns in the area. Today it is a modern city with a very large international airport, a large sea port that is very busy, and all the other things you would expect to find in a big city.\nUtilities.\nWater for the city comes from Eklutna Lake. \nThe city's electricity comes from power plants in the city and from a dam also fed by Eklutna Lake.\nHeat for homes comes from Natural gas provided by Enstar Natural Gas Company.\nClimate.\nAnchorage has a subarctic climate (\"Dfc\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification)."}

It is the main attraction of Crater Lake National Park. It is famous for its blue color and clear water. The lake partly fills a nearly deep caldera. The volcanic crater was formed by the collapse of the volcano, Mount Mazama, about 7,500 years ago. There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake. The evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years.\nIn 1853, miner John Wesley Hillman made the first recorded visit to the lake. He named the lake \"Deep Blue Lake\". The lake was renamed at least three times, as Blue Lake, Lake Majesty, and finally Crater Lake.\nCrater Lake is known for its famous piece of driftwood, named the \"Old Man of the Lake\". It is a tree that has been moving up and down in the water for more than 100 years. The lake water is cold, so the tree is well preserved. Originally, fish did not live in the lake. However, people stocked the lake with different kinds of fish between 1888 and 1941. Several species of fish still live in the lake.\nDimensions and depth.\nCrater Lake is in Klamath County. The lake is about northwest of the county seat of Klamath Falls, and about northeast of Medford. The lake has an average depth of . Its maximum depth is . The depth changes slightly as the weather changes. On the basis of maximum depth, Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States. It is the second deepest in North America, after Great Slave Lake in Canada. Crater Lake is also the ninth deepest lake in the world.\nHowever, on the basis of comparing average depths among the world's deepest lakes, Crater Lake is the third deepest in the world. The caldera rim of Crater Lake ranges in elevation from .\nGeology.\nMount Mazama is part of the Cascade Range island arc. It was built up over a period of at least 400,000 years. The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption. That led to the lowering of Mount Mazama around 5700 BC. Since that time, all eruptions on Mazama are limited to the caldera. Lava eruptions later created a central platform, called Wizard Island. Sediments and material from landslides also covered the caldera floor.\nEventually, the caldera cooled. That allowed rain and snow to form a lake. Fumaroles and hot springs remained common and active during this period. Also after some time, the slopes of the lake's caldera rim more or less stabilized. Streams restored a radial drainage pattern on the mountain, and forests began to cover the landscape. It is estimated that it took about 720 years to fill the lake to its present depth of 594 m. Much of this happened during a period when the climate was drier than it is now. Some hydrothermal activity remains along the lake floor. That means that at some time in the future Mazama may erupt once again.\nWater quality.\nThe waters of Crater Lake are some of the purest in North America. The water shows almost no pollution. There are several reasons, but the most significant is that the lake has no rivers or tributaries coming into it.\nClarity readings have always been in the high-20\u00a0meter to mid-30\u00a0meter (80\u2013115\u00a0ft) range. That is very clear for any natural body of water. In 1997, scientists recorded a record clarity of 43.3 meters (142\u00a0ft).\nThe lake has relatively high levels of dissolved salts. The average pH has generally ranged between 7 and 8.\nSacred significance.\nThe Klamath tribe of Native Americans have long thought of the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell of a battle between the sky god Skell and Llao, the god of the underworld. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle. That resulted in the creation of Crater Lake. The Klamath people used Crater Lake in vision quests. The Klamath believed those who were successful in such quests had more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.\nRelated pages.\nCrater Lake National Park"}

She was the author of over 80 books for young adults and children. Her characters are normal children facing challenges of growing up, and her stories are filled with humour. Some of her best known and loved characters are Ramona Quimby and her sister Beatrice (\"Beezus\"), Henry Huggins, Ralph S. Mouse, and Ribsy. \nBiography.\nBeverly Cleary was born Beverly Atlee Bunn in McMinnville, Oregon. When she was 6, her family moved to Portland, Oregon, where she went to grammar and high school. She was slow in learning to read, partly because she did not like the books the school wanted her to read, and partly due to an unkind first grade teacher. It was not until she was in third grade that she found enjoyment from books, when she started reading \"The Dutch Twins\" by Lucy Fitch Perkins. From then on, she visited the library often, though she rarely found the books she most wanted to read \u2014 those about children like herself.\nIn 1934, she moved to Ontario, California to attend Chaffey College, from which she earned an Associate of Arts diploma. She then moved to Berkeley to major in English at the University of California. After graduating with a B.A in English in 1938, she studied at the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington in Seattle, where she earned a degree in librarianship in 1939. Her first job was as a librarian in Yakima, Washington, where she met many children who were looking for the same books that she had always hoped to find as a child herself. In response, she wrote her first book, \"Henry Huggins,\" which was published in 1950. \"Beezus and Ramona\", Cleary's first novel to feature the Quimby sisters as the central focus of the story, was published in 1955, although Beezus and Ramona made frequent appearances in the Henry Huggins series as supporting characters.\nIn 1940 she married Clarence T. Cleary and they moved to Oakland, California. The Clearys became parents to a set of twins, Marianne Elisabeth and Malcolm James, in 1955. Clarence Cleary died in 2004. Beverly Cleary currently lives in Carmel, California.\nShe also wrote two autobiographies, \"A Girl from Yamhill\" and \"My Own Two Feet\".\nCleary celebrated her 100th birthday on April 12, 2016. On March 25, 2021, Cleary died in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, 18 days before her 105th birthday.\nCareer.\nHer books are available in 14 languages in over 20 countries. She has won many awards, including the 1984 Newbery Medal for her book \"Dear Mr. Henshaw\" and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award in 1975. Cleary received the Library of Congress \"Living Legends\" award in the \"Writers and Artists\" category in April 2000 for her major contributions to America's cultural heritage.\nHonors.\nThe Hollywood location of the Multnomah County library, near where she lived as a child, has created a map on their lobby wall of Henry Huggins' Klickitat Street neighborhood. Statues of her beloved characters Ramona, Henry Huggins, and the Huggins' dog Ribsy can be found in Grant Park in Portland, Oregon.\nIn 2004, the University of Washington's Information School completed fundraising for a Beverly Cleary Endowed Chair for Children and Youth Services to remember her work and commitment to librarianship.\nShe has a dorm at University of California, Berkeley named after her."}

It is 6 miles south of Gravesend and Dartford. The old church is called All Saints.\nHartley has many new buildings and some old houses, it now joins Longfield, the place in the north. In 2001 there were 5,395 persons living here. There are also woods and a farm near the houses. Most of the 2,145 houses in Hartley are owned by the persons who live in them.\nThe name Hartley means \"place in the wood where the deer are\". It was a very small place, but now is like a town. No great events happened here, and not many famous persons lived in Hartley.\nGeology.\nIn the Cretaceous time, much of England was under the sea. In the deep waters, the chalk of the North Downs of Kent was made. Then the sea made the clay which is over the chalk. Then the Ice Age froze the chalk and there were rivers which made the \"dry valley\" at Hartley Bottom.\nHistory.\nIn the year 1086, 15 families and 3 slaves lived in Hartley. Before the Black Death (1348) about 150 persons lived here. 53 persons made tax payments in 1377, which means about 85 lived here then. In 1392 a paper tells us that there was a chief house, where a manager lived. He farmed land for the owner. This land was called Hartley Court. Other persons who owned land in Hartley, had to go to the court of the owner and do some other work for him. \nThere was a fight at Hartley Wood in 1554, between supporters and opponents of Queen Mary I of England. Her supporters won. Hartley in 1650 was like the place in 1850, because almost all the buildings were there then. In 1770 the writer Edward Hasted said not many persons go to Hartley.\nSome buildings were made in the 1700s (like Hartley House and Yew Cottage). In 1841 there were 224 persons living in Hartley. Almost all worked on the farms. There was also a wheel maker, metal worker and drink sellers.\nThe growth of Hartley started after the railway came to Longfield in 1876, and water by pipe came in 1902. Next two companies \u2013 Payne, Trapps and Co Ltd, and Small Owners Limited sold land for houses and small farms. After 1945 there were many new houses and roads."}

They are mostly pale white and small (1-4 \u00a0mm long) crustaceans. \nThe term gribble was originally used for the wood-boring species, especially the first species described from Norway by Rathke in 1799, \"Limnoria lignorum\". The Limnoriidae have species which bore into seaweed and sea grass, as well as wood borers. \nThere are three genera, \"Paralimnoria\", \"Limnoria\" and \"Lynseia\". \"Limnoria\" has species in most seas. Those gribbles able to bore into living marine plants are thought to have evolved from a wood (dead plant) boring species. \nGribbles bore into wood and plant material for food. The cellulose of wood is digested. The most destructive species are \"Limnoria lignorum\", \"L. tripunctata\" and \"L. quadripunctata\". According to an expert, they are the only animals able to make a cellulase to dissolve plant cell walls. Other animals that eat plant fibres make use of bacteria in their gut to produce the enzyme.

However, they are the only surviving member of an order of reptiles which flourished 200 million years ago.\nThere is now only the genus Sphenodon, with two species of Tuatara. Both are endemic to (only live in) New Zealand. Lizards and snakes are the closest living relatives of the tuatara.\nTuatara are green-brown, and measure up to 80\u00a0cm from head to the end of their tail. They have a spiny crest along the back: the Maori word \"tuatara\" refers to this.\nThe crest is more pronounced in males. Tuatara are special in many ways. One of these is the pattern of their teeth. They have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw overlap one row on the lower jaw. This is unique among living species.\nSense organs.\nThird 'eye'.\nTuatara are also unusual because they have a third 'eye'. They have two normal eyes. The third eye is on top of their head, in between their other eyes. It does not see like a normal eye. The parietal eye, as it is called, is only visible in hatchlings. They have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months this becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment.\nThe function of the parietal eye is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to manufacture vitamin D. It may also do other things. Of all living tetrapods, the parietal eye is most obvious in this animal. The parietal eye is part of the pineal system. The animal's pineal gland secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders use their pineal body to perceive polarised light, which helps navigation. Unlike lizards they have no eardrums or external male sexual organ.\nHearing.\nTuataras do not have ears, but they can hear. They have a number of unique features in their skeleton (bones), some of them shared through common descent with fish.\nEndangered species.\nThe tuatara has been classified as an endangered species since 1895. The second species, \"S. guntheri\", was not discovered until 1989.\nTuatara, like many of New Zealand's native animals, are threatened by habitat loss and the introduced Polynesian Rat \"Rattus exulans\". They were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32 offshore islands, until the first mainland release into the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in 2005."}

Carmichael applied the \"Daubert\" standard to expert testimony from non-scientists.\nFacts of the case.\nPatrick Carmichael was driving his minivan on July 6, 1993, when the right rear tire blew out. One of the passengers in the vehicle died, and others were severely injured. Three months later, the Carmichaels sued the manufacturer of the tire, claiming that the tire was defective and the defect caused the accident. The Carmichaels' case rested largely on testimony from a tire failure expert.\nThe tire failure expert relied on features of tire technology that the manufacturer did not dispute, as well as background facts about the particular tire on the Carmichaels' van. The expert's conclusion that a defect in the tire caused the accident rested on certain observations about the tire that Kumho Tire vigorously disputed. Kumho also disagreed with certain aspects of the tire expert's methodology, and asked the federal district court hearing the case to exclude it under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\nThe district court took its cue from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, which had solidified a gatekeeping role for trial judges in admitting expert testimony. Under Daubert, certain factors contribute to the reliability, and hence the admissibility, of expert testimony, one of which is the general validity of the expert's methods. The district court found the tire expert's methods not to be scientifically valid, and hence excluded his testimony. This meant that Kumho Tire would prevail. The Carmichaels appealed to the Eleventh Circuit.\nThe Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's ruling in favor of Kumho Tire. It reasoned that Daubert was expressly limited only to scientific expert testimony and did not apply to \"skill- or experience-based observation.\" The tire expert's testimony rested on observation and experience, and so the Eleventh Circuit reasoned the district court should have made a different ruling based on Rule 702 without the Daubert gloss. Kumho Tire asked the Supreme Court to review whether Daubert applied solely to scientific evidence."}

Romney is the junior United States senator from Utah since January 3, 2019. He was the 70th Governor of Massachusetts serving from 2003 to 2007. He ran for the Republican Party nomination in the 2008 election, but lost the nomination to United States senator John McCain of Arizona.\nRomney would run again for the nomination only this time winning the nomination beating former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and former Speaker Newt Gingrich. His running mate was U.S. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. He ran against the incumbent President Barack Obama. He lost the election winning 206 of the electoral college to Obama's 332.\nIn the aftermath of the election, Romney remained low in politics and in the 2016 presidential election, Romney was a critic of Donald Trump and would endorse former Governor Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party. After the election of Trump, it was thought that Trump would pick Romney as Secretary of State, but the position went to businessman Rex Tillerson.\nAfter Utah Senator Orrin Hatch retired on February 16, 2018, Romney became a candidate for the United States senate in the 2018 United States Senate election in Utah. In June 2018, Romney won the Republican nomination for the Senate seat. He won the general election in a landslide victory replacing retiring Senator Orrin Hatch.\nEarly life.\nRomney was born in Detroit. His father, George Romney, was an auto executive and Governor of Michigan and his mother Lenore Romney, was an actress and politician. When Mitt was young, he served a Mormon mission in France. Romney graduated from Brigham Young University, in 1971, and later went to Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School. In the 1980s, Romney was one of the leaders of Bain Capital, a company that bought other companies and tried to make them more profitable. In 1994, Romney ran for the United States Senate against Ted Kennedy, but lost. Romney was in charge of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which helped run the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Romney took over the committee after a scandal where some people were being bribed.\nCareer.\nAfter success with the Olympics, Romney became Governor of Massachusetts. While Governor, he was one of the supporters of Massachusetts' health care plan though he now opposes Barack Obama's health care plan. Both plans are very similar.\nHe ran for President in 2008, but the Republican Party nominated John McCain instead. He ran again in 2012 and was nominated to be the main Republican candidate against President Barack Obama, but lost the election.\nPolitical life.\n2012 presidential campaign.\nBeginning of the campaign.\nAfter winning the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2012, Mitt Romney took part of the United States presidential election. He won the primaries against its major rivals Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich. Right after his winning in the republican primaries and access to the 2012 presidential campaign, Mitt Romney has been critiqued by the Democratic Party (United States) for being part in the board of directors for the company Bain Capital Inc. from 1999 to 2002. During these three years, purchases of different companies by Bain Capital led to relocation of high-tech jobs in the United States to Mexico and China. In these uncertain economic times, this charge was unpopular with the average American. The Democratic Party (United States) also revealed with the help of the American Broadcasting Company that Mitt Romney has bank accounts in the Cayman Islands which would allow him to stare money over U.S. tax laws . About this guilt, Mitt Romney said during his campaign in New Hampshire :\"{\u2026} if there's an opportunity to save taxes, we like anybody else in this country will follow that opportunity.\u201d.\nThe first presidential TV debate.\nDuring the first televised debate of the presidential campaign, Mitt Romney accused President Obama of having plunged America into the deepest economic crisis since the 1930s. He also suggests that President Barack Obama had not met its promises during his presidential previous mandate like increase the real income of the average American family. Mitt Romney made a provision to which pleased many American citizens during the debate that allowed him to gain some points to national survey and even surpass Barack Obama in the voting intentions of Americans.\nThe 47% story.\nAfter the first debate, an internet site named www.motherjones.com revealed on Monday September. 17, 2012 a YouTube video of Mitt Romney talking about some people of the United States who live at the expense of the state. \nIn this video he said: \"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it -- that that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. ... These are people who pay no income tax. ... [M]y job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\nConclusion of the 2012 presidential campaign.\nOn the night of November 6, 2012, he announced that Barack Obama was re-elected as President of the United States of America and by extension Mitt Romney lost his chance to become president. He had received 206 votes against the 270 required to win.\nHis niece, Ronna Romney McDaniel, became the new Chair of the Republican Party after President Donald Trump nominated the then-Chairman Reince Priebus to White House Chief of Staff.\nU.S. Senator from Utah.\nOn January 2, 2018, after Orrin Hatch announced he would retire, Romney changed his Twitter location from Massachusetts to Holladay, Utah opening the long speculation of Romney running for the Senate seat.\nOn February 16, 2018, Romney formally launched his campaign through a video message posted on Facebook and Twitter. He won the Republican nomination on June 26, 2018.\nRomney defeated Jenny Wilson in the general election in November 2018.\nOn February 13, 2021 Romney voted that Republican nominated President Donald Trump was guilty of starting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol. He and six other Republican senators also voted that Trump was guilty. This was after the House of Representatives Second impeachment of Donald Trump."}

It has similarities to basketball and soccer, although players are in the pool. Players try to get the ball into the goal more times than the opposing team, without using goggles.\nOutline.\nWater polo is a team game. Two teams play a match. Each match has four periods called \"quarters\". The length of each period is usually between 5 and 8 minutes. Because the amount of time spent on fouls or out throws is not counted in the quarter time, an average quarter really lasts around 12 minutes.\nEach team has six field players and one goalkeeper. Water polo players need to be good at swimming and ball handing. They need good reflexes and awareness.\nPlayers must keep floating in a game. Players may not stand on the bottom of the pool.\nWater polo is played in a pool : depth is above 2 m, a vertical line is 30 m and width is 20 m.\nEquipments.\nTo play water polo, you need swimwear, caps, mouth guards, a ball and a goal.\nThe caps' design is unique. They are designed to protect head and ears.\nHistory.\nThe rules of water polo were originally developed in the mid-nineteenth century in Great Britain by William Wilson. The game originated as a form of rugby football played in rivers and lakes in England and Scotland with a ball constructed of Indian rubber, probably from the 1850s onwards."}

They are made of a whitefish like cod that is battered and breaded. They are often eaten with tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, or ketchup. \"Fishsticks\" are popular with children and their parents as an easy-to-prepare finger food that is somewhat healthy for kids.\nHistory.\nFishsticks first came about as a result of the invention of the plate froster in 1929, the first quick freezer. To ensure rapid freezing, food needed to be in slim rectangular slabs. A suitable candidate for this freezing method was fishsticks, slivers (small, thin pieces) cut from large fish and dipped in bread crumbs for frying.\nIn Britain in the 1950s, most of the herring catch was pickled and exported to other North European countries. In an attempt to make herring more appealing on the home market, companies tried to present it in a new way, creating herring fishsticks called \u201cherring savouries\u201d and were tested on the market against a bland control product of cod sticks, sold as \u201cfish fingers.\u201d Shoppers in Southampton and South Wales, showed an overwhelming preference for the cod. Cod fishsticks were first produced in Great Yarmouth and introduced in Britain on 26 September 1955. They became immensely popular after television advertising began in 1956. To this day, fish sticks are a favorite food among children.\nProduction.\nOn modern production lines, headless fish are processed through a machine that removes a fillet from each side of the backbone. The fillets then pass over a wheel and a blade that separates the skin from the flesh. Machine filleting leaves a few pin-like bones in the fillet, so the flesh containing the bones is cut out.\nFillets are formed into frozen blocks. A conveyor sends the blanks through batter and breadcrumbs, doubling the thickness of the fishstick. Then each is passed through a hot vegetable oil bath for about one minute to seal the coating and allow the fishstick to be grilled or fried. Then the fishstick is frozen again, with the center reaching -4\u00a0\u00b0F/-20\u00a0\u00b0C in less than 20 minutes. After packaging, it is stored at -18\u00a0\u00b0F/-28\u00a0\u00b0C, ready for distribution."}

The data may be printed on paper, or stored in a computer. The output may be shown as transmittance (a linear scale from 0-100%) or as absorbance (a logarithmic scale from zero to infinity). The useful range of the absorbance scale is from 0-2 but it is desirable to keep within the range 0-1 because, above 1, the results become unreliable due to scattering of light.

Examples include:\nHow it works.\nUsually, heat flows from a hot place to a cold place, according to the second law of thermodynamics. Heat will not move from a cold place to a warmer place by itself. Because of this, a heat pump must use extra energy to move the heat. This is sort of like pumping water uphill.\nMost heat pumps use electric motors to provide energy. Some heat pumps use heat energy, supplied by a flame or an electric heater.\nMost heat pumps have a refrigeration cycle using a compressor. A refrigeration cycle uses a fluid which moves through tubes and carries the heat. The fluid is called a refrigerant. During the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid.\nWhen the refrigerant changes from a (compressed) liquid to a gas, it absorbs heat energy from the environment. When the refrigerant changes from a gas back to a liquid, it loses heat energy.\nThe heat pump is set up so that the refrigerant gains heat from one place that will be cooled, and moves it to another place that will be warmed.\nA heat pump forces the refrigerant to change from a gas to a liquid. It uses a compressor to do this. Often, an electric motor drives the compressor. The compressor compresses the refrigerant, and this makes it change from a gas to a liquid. Compressing will heat up the liquid extensively.\nAt the other end of the cycle, the refrigerant boils again, absorbing heat from its surroundings, it cools them down. So where the refrigerant is changing from a liquid to a gas, it feels cooler.\nThis is the complete cycle, from the cooling side to the heating side:\nOn the cooling side, heat is taken up to boil the refrigerant from a liquid to a gas. Then the fluid moves to the heating side.There, the compressor forces the refrigerant back to a liquid again. This makes it give up its heat. So heat has moved from the cooling side to the heating side. Then, the cycle repeats.\nIf the cooling side is the inside of a refrigerator, it gets cold.\nIf the cooling side is the inside of a building, and the warming side is the outside of the building, the inside of the building gets cold. This is how an air conditioner works.\nIf the cooling side is the outside of the building, and the warming side is the inside of the building, this is how a heat pump can heat a building during the winter."}

Due to the force of gravity, density and pressure do not even out vertically. Density and pressure on the bottom will be more than at the top.\nEntropy is a measure of spread of matter and energy to everywhere they have access.\nThe most common wording for the second law of thermodynamics is essentially due to \"Rudolf Clausius\":\nIn other words, everything tries to maintain the same temperature over time.\nThere are many statements of the second law which use different terms, but all mean the same thing. Another statement by Clausius is:\nHeat cannot of itself pass from a colder to a hotter body.\nAn equivalent statement by Lord Kelvin is:\nA transformation whose only final result is to convert heat, extracted from a source at constant temperature, into work, is impossible. \nThe second law only applies to large systems. The second law is about the likely behavior of a system where no energy or matter gets in or out. The bigger the system is, the more likely the second law will be true.\nOverview.\nIn a general sense, the second law says that temperature differences between systems in contact with each other tend to even out and that work can be obtained from these non-equilibrium differences, but that loss of thermal energy occurs, when work is done and entropy increases. Pressure, density and temperature differences in an isolated system, all tend to equalize if given the opportunity; density and pressure, but not temperature, are affected by gravity.

Whether in homes, offices or vehicles, its purpose is to provide comfort by altering the properties of the air, usually by cooling the air inside. The main function of air conditioner is to change adverse temperature.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century British scientist and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. \nIn 1842, American physician Dr. John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients. He hoped eventually to use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings and even considered cooling entire cities with a system of centralized air conditioning units.\nAir conditioning applications.\nAir conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into \"comfort\" and \"process\". \nComfort applications aim to provide an indoor environment that remains relatively constant in a range preferred by humans despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads. \nProcess applications aim to provide a suitable environment for an industrial or a commercial process, regardless of internal heat loads and external weather conditions. Although often in the same comfort range, it is the requirements of \u00a0the process that determines conditions, not human preference. Process applications include:\nOther examples include:\nIn both comfort and process applications, the objective is not only to control temperature (although in some comfort applications this is all that is controlled) but also factors like humidity, air movement and air quality.\nAir conditioning system basics and theories.\nRefrigeration cycle.\nIn the refrigeration cycle, a pump transfers heat from a lower temperature source into a higher temperature heat sink. Heat will naturally flow in the opposite direction. This is the most common type of air conditioning. A refrigerated air conditioning system\u00a0works in much the same way pumping\u00a0heat out of the room in which it stands.\nThis cycle takes advantage of the universal gas law \"PV\" = \"nRT\", where \"P\" is pressure, \"V\" is volume, \"R\" is the universal gas constant, \"T\" is temperature, and \"n\" is the number of molecules of gas (1 mole = 6.022\u00d71023 molecules).\nThe most common refrigeration cycle uses an electric motor to drive a compressor. In an automobile the compressor is driven by a pulley on the engine's crankshaft, with both using electric motors for air circulation. Since evaporation occurs when heat is absorbed, and condensation occurs when heat is released, air conditioners are designed to use a compressor to cause pressure changes between two compartments, and actively pump a coolant around an enclosed system. The cooling liquid, or refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment (the evaporator coil). Low pressure then causes the refrigerant to evaporate taking the heat with it. In the other compartment (the condenser), the refrigerant vapour is compressed and forced through another heat exchange coil, condensed into a liquid which then rejects the heat previously absorbed from the cooled space.\nHealth implications.\nAir conditioning has as much influence on human health as any generic heating system. Poorly maintained air-conditioning systems (especially large, centralized systems) can occasionally promote the growth and spread of microorganisms such as\u00a0\"Legionella pneumophila,\" the infectious agent responsible for Legionnaire's disease. Air conditioning can have a positive effect on sufferers of allergies and asthma.\nIn serious heat waves, air conditioning can save the lives of the elderly. Some local authorities have even set up public cooling centers for the benefit of those without air conditioning at home.\nInstallation of the conditioner.\nOne of the main conditions for the high-quality installation of HVAC equipment is the correct choice of the fixing location of the indoor and outdoor units. Each of the listed modules is distinguished by certain design characteristics, rules for future installation. To install an air conditioner, you need to take into account all the requirements thanks to which the equipment can be further operated in different modes.\nYou need to install an air conditioner, given the following nuances:\nThe installation of an air conditioner depends on certain criteria, it starts with finding the ideal site for mounting the outdoor unit.

The law forms the basis of the principle of conservation of energy. This means that anything that uses energy is changing the energy from one kind of energy to another. For example, exercising changes energy from food into kinetic (motion) energy. Another example: In the Sun (or any star), Nuclear Fusion changes mass into heat and light (Electromagnetic Radiation), which travels to Earth and is used by plants to create food (chemical energy) via photosynthesis, which can be eaten by animals allowing them to move (kinetic energy). Energy only ever changes its form; it is neither created nor destroyed. This is why Perpetual motion machines do not exist and could never exist; it would break a fundamental law of physics. \nPeople can use the changes to do work that is useful. Examples of forms of energy in classical mechanics include heat, light, kinetic (movement) or potential energy. However, in modern physics it is considered that there are only two types of energy - mass and kinetic energy, although this may not be helpful to those not familiar with more complex physics.\nThe law means that the total energy of the universe (or any Closed system) is a constant. However, energy can be transferred from one part of the universe to another.\nThe most common wording of the first law of thermodynamics used by scientists is:\nHistory.\nJames Prescott Joule was the first person who found out by experiments that heat and work are convertible.\nThe first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics was given by \"Rudolf Clausius\" in 1850: \"There is a state function E, called 'energy', whose differential equals the work exchanged with the surroundings during an adiabatic process.\"\nThermodynamics and Engineering.\nIn thermodynamics and engineering, it is natural to think of the system as a heat engine which does work on the surroundings, and to state that the total energy added by heating is equal to the sum of the increase in internal energy plus the work done by the system. Hence formula_1 is the amount of energy lost by the system due to work done by the system on its surroundings. During the portion of the thermodynamic cycle where the engine is doing work, formula_1 is positive, but there will always be a portion of the cycle where formula_1 is negative, e.g., when the working gas is being compressed. When formula_1 represents the work done by the system, the first law is written:\nPeople disagree whether energy is a positive or a negative number. So that formula_6 is the flow of heat out of the system, and formula_1 is the work into the system:\nBecause of this ambiguity, it is very important in any discussion involving the first law to explicitly establish the sign convention in use.\ndU = the change in internal energy\nQ = heat\nW = work"}

Formally, it says that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant, although it may change forms, e.g. friction turns kinetic energy into thermal energy. In thermodynamics, the first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy for thermodynamic systems.\nFrom a mathematical point of view, the energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is a result of the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. Philosophically, this can be stated as \"nothing depends on time per se (time itself)\".\nHistorical information.\nAncient philosophers as far back as Thales of Miletus had the idea that there is some underlying substance of which everything is made. But that is not the same as our concept of \"mass-energy\" today (for example, Thales thought the underlying substance was water).\nIn 1638, Galileo published his analysis of several situations. This included the famous \"interrupted pendulum\". This can be described (in modernized language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. However, Galileo did not explain the process in modern terms and had not understood the modern concept either. The German Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during 1676-1689 attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with \"motion\" (kinetic energy). Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several masses, \"mi\" each with velocity \"vi\" ),\nwas conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the \"vis viva\" or \"living force\" of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic energy in situations where there is no friction. \nMeanwhile, in 1843 James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the \"Joule apparatus\", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate. He showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was approximately equal to the thermal energy (heat) gained by the water by friction with the paddle.\nOver the period 1840-1843, similar work was carried out by engineer Ludwig A. Colding though it was little-known outside his native Denmark.\nProof.\nIt is easy to see that\nformula_2\nwhich is also\nformula_3\nformula_4\nAssuming that formula_5 and that formula_6, then\nformula_7\nformula_8\nformula_10\nTherefore, energy does not vary with time."}
