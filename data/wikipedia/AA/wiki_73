It is just on top of the spinal cord. It connects the higher parts of the brain to the spinal cord (see the picture at the right of this page).\nThe cardiac, respiratory, and vasomotor control centers are in the medulla. This means that the medulla controls heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and the size of the body's blood vessels. If the medulla did not work, the person would die.\nFunctions.\nThe medulla does many important things. It relays nerve signals between the brain and spinal cord. Signals from the brain tell the rest of the body what to do. Signals from the spinal cord tell the brain what is going on in the body. Without the medulla, none of these signals would get through.\nThe medulla also controls autonomic functions (things the body does automatically, without a person having to think about them).\nThe breathing control center.\nThe medulla controls breathing. Groups of neurons in the medulla tell the body when to breathe in, when to breathe faster, and when to breathe slower.\nThe medulla measures how much carbon dioxide is in a person's blood. When the body makes energy, carbon dioxide gets left over. The body has to get rid of extra carbon dioxide, because it is poisonous. The only way the body can get rid of carbon dioxide is by breathing it out.\nIf there is too much carbon dioxide in the blood, the medulla sends signals to the breathing muscles and tells them to work harder. This makes the person breathe faster, so they can breathe out the extra carbon dioxide. Once the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood is normal again, the medulla tells the body to breathe slower again.\nThe cardiac control center.\nThe medulla helps control the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The main part of the nerves that control these two systems are in the medulla. These nerves get signals from other parts of the brain and the body. These signals help tell the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems what to do.\nTogether, these two systems control many important things, like how fast the heart beats and how hard it squeezes. In the cardiac center, there are special nerves that will make the heart beat harder and faster, called \"excitatory nerves\". There are also \"inhibitory nerves\", which will make the heart beat slower and not as hard. If a person's blood pressure gets too low, the cardiac center will send a message to the excitatory nerves, telling them to make the heart beat faster and harder. This raises the blood pressure. If the blood pressure gets too high, the cardiac center sends a message to the inhibitory nerves, which slow the heart down and make it not beat so hard. This lowers the blood pressure. In a healthy person, the cardiac center balances out the signals it sends to these sets of nerves, to keep the blood pressure normal.\nThe vasomotor control center.\nThe vasomotor center controls the size of the body's blood vessels. When a person is stressed or in danger, the vasomotor center makes the blood vessels get smaller. This is part of the body's \"fight or flight\" reaction. It causes more blood to go to the body's most important organs, like the brain, heart, and lungs. This can help a person survive if they are in danger. It also makes the blood pressure go up.\nAt other times, the vasomotor center makes the blood vessels get wider. This makes the blood pressure go down, and makes it easier for blood to get to some parts of the body.\nReflex control centers.\nThe medulla also controls some important reflexes, like vomiting, coughing, sneezing, and swallowing.\nOther functions.\nSets of neurons in the medulla help control other important things, like movement, digestion, and sleep.\nInjuries to the medulla.\nBecause the medulla controls so many important things, injuries to the medulla can cause some serious problems.\nFor example, an injury to the middle of the medulla can cause these symptoms:\nAn injury to one side of the medulla can cause these symptoms:\nIf a person's medulla is completely destroyed (for example, from a very bad injury, or because it did not get enough oxygen to survive), that person will die."}

In humans, it is by far the largest part of the brain.\nThough this cannot be seen directly, different parts of the cortex have different functions (see diagram). It plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. \nIt is a sheet of neural tissue that is outermost to the cerebrum of the mammalian brain. It has up to six layers of nerve cells. The human cerebral cortex is 2\u20134\u00a0mm (0.08\u20130.16\u00a0inches) thick.\nIn preserved brains, it is grey, so it is often called 'grey matter'. In contrast to gray matter that is formed from neurons and their unmyelinated fibers, the white matter below them is formed predominantly by myelinated axons interconnecting neurons in different regions of the cerebral cortex with each other and neurons in other parts of the central nervous system.\nThe surface of the cerebral cortex is folded in large mammals, such that more than two-thirds of it in the human brain is buried in the grooves.\nNeocortex.\nThe phylogenetically most recent part of the cerebral cortex, the neocortex, has six horizontal layers; the more ancient part of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, has at most three cellular layers. Neurons in various layers connect vertically to form small microcircuits, called 'columns'.\nThe neocortex is the newest part of the cerebral cortex to evolve. The six-layer neocortex is a distinguishing feature of mammals; it has been found in the brains of all mammals, but not in any other animals.

Carver is considered a major American writer of the late 20th century. He also helped improve short story writing in the 1980s.\nLife.\nEarly life and first marriage.\nCarver was born in Clatskanie, Oregon, a mill town on the Columbia River, and grew up in Yakima, Washington. His father was a skilled sawmill worker from Arkansas. He was a fisherman and a heavy drinker. Carver's mother sometimes worked as a waitress and as a clerk in a shop. He had one brother, James Franklin Carver, was born in 1943.\nCarver studied at local schools in Amery, Wisconsin. In his spare time he read mostly novels by Mickey Spillane or publications such as Sports Afield and Outdoor Life and hunted and fished with friends and family. After graduating from Yakima High School in 1956, Carver worked with his father at a sawmill in California. In June 1957, aged 19, he married 16-year-old Maryann Burk. She had just graduated from a private Episcopal school for girls. Their daughter, Christine La Rae, was born in December 1957. When their second child, a boy named Vance Lindsay, was born the next year, Carver was 20. Carver supported his family by working as a janitor, sawmill laborer, delivery man, and library assistant. During their marriage, Maryann worked as a waitress, salesperson, administrative assistant, and high school English teacher.\nCalifornia and beginning to write.\nCarver became interested in writing in California. He had moved there with his family because his mother-in-law had a home in Paradise. Carver attended a creative-writing course taught by the novelist John Gardner. Gardner became his mentor and had a major influence on Carver's life and career. Carver continued his studies first at Chico State University and then at Humboldt State College in Arcata, California, where he studied with Richard Cortez Day. Carver received his B.A. in 1963. During this period he was first published and served as editor for the university literary magazine called Toyon. Carver included some of his own writing under pen names. He later attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop, at the University of Iowa, for one year. Maryann graduated from San Jose State College in 1970 and taught English at Los Altos High School until 1977.\nIn the mid-1960s Carver and his family lived in Sacramento. He worked as a night custodian at Mercy Hospital. He sat in on classes at what was then Sacramento State College including workshops with poet Dennis Schmitz. Carver and Schmitz soon became friends, and Carver's first book of poems, \"Near Klamath\", was later written and published with helpful advice from Schmitz.\nWith his appearance in the respected \"Foley collection,\" the impending publication of \"Near Klamath\" by the English Club of Sacramento State College, and the death of his father, 1967 was a landmark year for Carver. That was also the year that he moved his family to Palo Alto, California, so that he could take a job as a textbook editor for Science Research Associates. He worked there until he was fired in 1970 for his inappropriate writing style. In the 1970s and 1980s as his writing career began to take off, Carver taught for several years at universities throughout the United States.\nAlcoholism.\nDuring his years of working different jobs, rearing children, and trying to write, Carver started to drink heavily. He said that he eventually more or less gave up writing and started drinking all of the time. In the fall semester of 1973, Carver was a teacher in the Iowa Writers' Workshop with John Cheever, but Carver said that they did less teaching than drinking and almost no writing. The next year, after leaving Iowa City, Cheever went to a treatment center to try to overcome his alcoholism, but Carver continued drinking for three years. After going in the hospital three times (between June 1976 and February or March 1977), Carver began his 'second life' and stopped drinking on June 2, 1977, with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous.\nLater life and second marriage.\nCarver met the poet Tess Gallagher at a writers' conference in Dallas, Texas in November, 1977. Beginning in January, 1979, Carver and Gallagher lived together in El Paso, Texas, in a borrowed cabin near Port Angeles, in western Washington state, and in Tucson, Arizona. In 1980, they moved to Syracuse. Gallagher was the coordinator of the creative writing program at Syracuse University. Carver was a professor in the English department. He and Gallagher bought a house in Syracuse, at 832 Maryland Avenue. Later, the house became so popular that the couple had to hang a sign outside that read \"Writers At Work\" so that people would leave them alone. In 1982, Carver and first wife, Maryann, were divorced. He married Gallagher in 1988 in Reno, Nevada. Six weeks later, on August 2, 1988, Carver died in Port Angeles, Washington, from lung cancer at the age of 50. In the same year, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nRaymond Carver is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Port Angeles, WA. The words on his grave are:\n\"LATE FRAGMENT\"\n\"And did you get what\nyou wanted from this life, even so?\"\n\"I did.\"\n\"And what did you want?\"\n\"To call myself beloved, to feel myself\nbeloved on the earth.\"\nWriting.\nCarver's career was dedicated to short stories and poetry. He often wrote about blue-collar experiences. These were similar to his own life. In the same way, he often included themes of alcoholism and recovery from his life.\nHis first published story appeared in 1960, titled \"The Furious Seasons.\" His first collection, \"Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?\", was published in 1976. The story with the same name had already appeared in the collection, \"Best American Short Stories 1967\".\nTess Gallagher published five Carver stories after he died in a book called \"Call If You Need Me\". One of the stories, \"Kindling\", won an O. Henry Award in 1999. Throughout his lifetime Carver won six O. Henry Awards: the winning stories were: \"Are These Actual Miles\" (originally titled \"What is it?\") (1972), \"Put Yourself in My Shoes\" (1974), \"Are You A Doctor?\" (1975), \"A Small, Good Thing\" (1983), and \"Errand\" (1988).\nCarver believed he would have died of alcoholism at the age of 40 if he had not found a way to stop drinking. When he knew the cancer would kill him, he wrote a poem about that bonus of 10 years, called \"Gravy.\"\nWorks.\nFiction.\nCompilations.\nAyale Dahir (2009) - Skidz My Friend"}

Each consul was given veto power over his colleague and the officials would alternate each month.\nThe consuls were usually patricians, though after 367 BC plebs (common people; plebeians) could stand for election as consul.\nConsuls had extensive power in peacetime (administrative, legislative and judicial), and in wartime often held the highest military command. They conducted some religious rites which could only be done by the highest state officials. Consuls also read auguries, an essential step before leading armies into the field.\nCivil administration.\nThe consuls could convene the Senate, and presided over its meetings. Each consul served as president of the Senate for a month. They could also summon any of the Roman assemblies and preside over them. Thus, the consuls conducted the elections and put legislative measures to the vote. When neither consul was within the city, their civic duties were assumed by the \"praetor urbanus\" (city prefect).\nEach consul was accompanied in every public appearance by twelve \"lictors\", who displayed the magnificence of the office and served as his bodyguards. Each lictor held a \"fasces\", a bundle of rods that contained an axe. The rods symbolized the power of scourging, and the axe the power of capital punishment. When inside the city, the lictors removed the axes from the fasces to show that a citizen could not be executed without a trial. Upon entering the democratic assembly, the lictors would lower the fasces to show that the powers of the consuls derive from the people (populus romanus).\nMilitary powers.\nOutside the walls of Rome, the powers of the consuls were far greater in their role as commanders-in-chief of all Roman legions. It was in this function that the consuls were vested with full imperium (power).\nWhen legions were ordered by a decree of the Senate, the consuls conducted the conscription. Upon entering the army, all soldiers had to take their oath of allegiance to the consuls. The consuls also oversaw the gathering of troops provided by Rome\u2019s allies.\nWithin the city a consul could punish and arrest a citizen, but had no power to inflict capital punishment. When on campaign, however, a consul could inflict any punishment he saw fit on any soldier, officer, citizen or ally.\nEach consul commanded an army, usually two legions strong, with the help of military tribunes and a quaestor who had financial duties. In the rare case that both consuls marched together, each one held the command for a day in turn. A typical consular army was about 20,000 men strong and consisted of two citizen and two allied legions. In the early years of the republic, Rome's enemies were in central Italy, so campaigns lasted a few months.\nAs Rome's frontiers expanded, in the 2nd century BC, the campaigns became lengthier. Rome was a warlike society, and very seldom did not wage war. So the consul upon entering office was expected by the Senate and the people to march his army against Rome's enemies, and expand the Roman frontiers. His soldiers expected to return to their homes after the campaign with spoils. If the consul won an overwhelming victory, he was hailed as imperator by his troops, and could request to be granted a triumph.\nThe consul could conduct the campaign as he saw fit, and had unlimited powers. However, after the campaign, he could be prosecuted for his misdeeds.\nStatus in the Empire period.\nIn the Roman Empire, the consuls were merely a figurative representative of Rome\u2019s republican heritage. The consulate then held much less power and authority, since the emperor was the supreme leader. However, consuls were often high-ranking and important in their own right. Some were designated successors of their emperor. Also, emperors frequently appointed themselves as consuls.\nThe office survived (much altered) until the early 9th century AD."}

The struggle lasted 50 years, from 499\u2013449. Herodotus wrote a history of the war. Fifty years before the war started, Cyrus the Great had conquered the Greek colonies on the western coast of Asia Minor, an area the Greeks called Ionia. The Persians put a tyrant in charge of each city or polis. About 530 BC Cyrus died in battle.\nAristagoras, the Tyrant of Miletus was on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos with Persian support, but that was a failure. Before he could be dismissed, Arisagoras encouraged Ionia to rebel against the Persians. This led to the Ionian Revolt. Aristagoras got support from Athens and Eretria, and together they burnt the Persian regional capital city, Sardis. The Persian king, now Darius the Great, vowed revenge.\nFirst invasion of Greek kingdoms.\nThe first Persian invasion of Greek majority kingdoms began in 492 BC, led by the Persian general Mardonius. They successfully beat Thrace and Macedon, but several mishaps forced an early end to the rest of the campaign.p135-138.\nThe Battle of Marathon.\nIn 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece, this time across the Aegean Sea. This expedition captured the Cyclades, then destroyed Eretria. On the way to Athens, the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon, ending Persian efforts at that time.\nDarius then began to plan to completely conquer Greece, but died in 486 BC. Command passed to his son Xerxes. In 480 BC, Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled.\nVictory over the allied Greek states at the famous Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to burn Athens (which had been evacuated) and overrun most of Greece. However, against the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, the confederated Greeks went on the offensive, decisively defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea, and ending the invasion of Greece by the Achaemenid Empire.\nList of main events.\nMuch of what is known of these wars comes from Herodotus.\nLater wars.\nAlthough 449 BC saw the end of the wars started by the Ionian revolt, the two civilisations continued for more than a hundred years. The wars between Athens and Sparta allowed Persia to take back all she had lost in the Greco\u2013Persian wars, until finally Alexander the Great put an end to the Achaemenid Empire.

It is a defence for Black when White opens by moving his King's pawn two squares on the first move. It begins: \nUsually, the next moves are:\nIt is then followed by 3. (the Modern Variation), 3. (the Classical Variation), 3. (the Exchange Variation), or 3. (the Advance Variation). The modern variation (3.Nc3) is most popular. \nThe Caro\u2013Kann, like the Sicilian defence and French defence, is an asymmetrical defence to 1.e4. These are sometimes called 'semi-open games'. The Caro is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than the others, which means that play is likely to be more quiet and positional. It may lead to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure.\nThe opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian Marcus Kann, who studied the opening in 1886.\nClassical or Capablanca variation.\nThe most common way of handling the Caro\u2013Kann, the Classical variation (often called the Capablanca variation) happens after the moves \nFor a long time, this was thought to be the best play for both sides in the Caro\u2013Kann. White usually continues\nAlthough White's pawn on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an endgame.\nThis variation is a big reason that people think the Caro-Kann is a solid defence. Black makes very few compromises in his pawn structure, and plays c5 in time to fight for the d4 square. Black can castle queenside, castle kingside, or even leave his king in the centre. Should the game go to an endgame, Black often has good chances because of his solid pawn structure and kingside pawn majority.\nSmyslov or Modern variation.\nAnother solid positional line is the Modern variation. It happens after the moves \nPlayed by the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, today the variation is called either the Smyslov variation or, most often, the Modern variation. \nThe short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to make developing his pieces easier by trading a pair of knights without damaging his pawn structure by the direct 4...Nf6. Play is similar to the Classical variation except that Black is not forced to play his QB to the g6 square. However, this freedom comes at a cost as White is able to take up space in the center. White often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5!? pressuring key points such as the f7-square.\nThis variation can lead to a quick mating trap with 5.Qe2 Ngf6?? 6.Nd6#.\n4...Nf6 variations.\nTwo variations begin with:\nThe Bronstein\u2013Larsen Variation is after:\nBlack has chosen a worse pawn structure, and often castles queenside. Black does have compensation, with the open g-file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro-Kann. It is generally considered somewhat double-edged.\nThe Korchnoi Variation arises after:\nViktor Korchnoi has played 5...exf6 many times (including his first world championship match with Anatoly Karpov), and this line has also been employed by Ulf Andersson. Black's 5...exf6 is thought to be sounder than 5...gxf6!? of the previous and offers Black fast development, though also giving White the superior pawn structure and long-term prospects.\nAdvance variation.\nThe Advance variation is 3.e5:\nThe main replies are:\n3...Bf5\nis most often played. Against it are aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian Grandmaster Alexei Shirov. A more natural development 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3 was popularised by English Grandmaster Nigel Short and often seen in the 1990s.\n3...c5 is an important alternative which avoids the opening theory on 3...Bf5. It was used by Botvinnik in his 1961 match with Tal. In comparison to the French defense, Black gains the tempo normally spent on ...e6. However, White can counter this by opening the centre with 4. dxc5. This exposes the black pawn on d5.\n3...e6 is natural and playable, but when Black plays ...c5 (as he soon will do) he is a tempo behind the advance line of the French defence (1e4 e6 2.d5 d5 3.e5 c5).\nExchange variation and Panov-Botvinnik Attack.\nThe Exchange Variation is\n1.e4 c6\n2.d4 d5\n3.exd5 cxd5.\nThe Panov-Botvinnik Attack begins with the move\n4.c4.\nThis system often leads to typical isolated queen's pawn (IQP) positions, with White gaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to make up for the long-term structural weakness of the isolated d4 pawn. The major variation in this line 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black's main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position which often transposes into lines of the Nimzo-Indian defence) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square through the advance of his b-pawn to b5 or by exchanging the Black's Knight on c6 after Bb5.\nThe \"true\" Exchange Variation begins with\n4.Bd3 Nc6\n5.c3 Nf6\n6.Bf4 Bg4\n7.Qb3\nThis line is thought to have equal chances for both sides, and was tried by Bobby Fischer. Some of the strategic ideas are analogous to the Queen's Gambit declined, Exchange variation, (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5) with colours reversed.\nTwo knights variation.\nThis is 1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3, played by Bobby Fischer in his youth. White gets rapid development and has options with the d-pawn. Black's logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. 4...Bh5 is a complicated line, in which White can trap the bishop, though Black has much compensation.\nThe variation sets a trap: if Black plays along the lines of the Classical Variation, he gets in trouble after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?! (5...Bg4) 6.h4 h6 7.Ne5 Bh7 (7...Qd6 may be best) 8.Qh5! g6 (forced) 9.Bc4! e6 (9...gxh5?? 10.Bxf7#) 10.Qe2 with a huge advantage for White. Now 10...Qe7! is best. Instead, Lasker\u2013Radsheer, 1908 and Alekhine-Bruce, 1938 ended quickly after, respectively, 10...Bg7?? 11.Nxf7! and 10...Nf6?? 11.Nxf7! \nOther lines.\nWhite can play 2.c4. Then Black may play 2...d5 (see ). This can transpose to the Panov\u2013Botvinnik line given above, with 3.exd5 cxd5 4.d4 or White can capture twice on d5. Alternatively, Black may play 2...e5.\nAlso, White can play 2.Nc3. Then Black may play 2...d5. If White replies 3.d4 then we get the main Capablanca line or the Two knights variation. Or Black may play 2...g6.\nThe Caro\u2013Kann can also be reached through the English Opening: 1.c4 c6 2.e4 d5.\nECO codes.\nThe Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings has ten codes for the Caro\u2013Kann Defence, B10 to B19.\nMore reading.\nAlso, more advanced:"}

It appears that civilization did not recover to the same level as that of the Hittites for another thousand years. Hattusa, the Hittite capital, was burned and abandoned, and never reoccupied. Troy was destroyed at least twice, before being abandoned until Roman times.\nCyprus.\nThe sacking and burning of the sites of Enkomi, Kition, and Sinda may have happened twice, before they were abandoned. Originally, two waves of destruction, ca. 1230 BC by the Sea Peoples and ca. 1190 BC by Aegean refugees have been proposed.\nSyria.\nSyrian sites previously showed evidence of trade links with Egypt and the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age. Evidence at Ugarit shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of Merenptah.\nThe last Bronze Age king of Ugarit, Ammurapi, was a contemporary of the Hittite king Suppiluliuma II. The exact dates of his reign are unknown. A letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city. Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Near Eastern states from invasion by the advancing Sea Peoples in a dramatic response to a plea for assistance from the king of Alasiya (Cyprus):\nMy father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka?...Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.\nUnfortunately for Ugarit, no help arrived and Ugarit was burned to the ground at the end of the Bronze Age. A cuneiform tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah, about 1178 BC.\nLevant.\nAll centres along a coastal route from Gaza northward were destroyed, and not reoccupied for up to thirty years.\nGreece.\nNone of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived. Destruction was heaviest at palaces and fortified sites. Thebes was one of the earliest examples of this. Its palace was sacked repeatedly between 1300 and 1200 BC. Eventually it was destroyed by fire. \nAt many other sites it is entirely unclear what happened. It is clear that Athens saw a significant decline during the Bronze Age Collapse. There is no evidence of any significant destruction at this site. Fortification at this site suggests fear of the decline in Athens. It is possible that the abandonment of Athens was not a violent affair and other causes have been suggested.\nThe Peloponnese was the worst affected in Greece by far. Up to 90% of small sites in the region were abandoned, which suggests a major depopulation in the region. Again, as with many of the sites of destruction in Greece, it is unclear how this destruction came about. The city of Mycenae for example was initially destroyed in an earthquake in 1250 BC as evidenced by the presence of crushed bodies buried in collapsed buildings. However, the site was rebuilt only to face destruction in 1190 BC as the result of a series of major fires. There is a suggestion by Robert Drews that the fires could have been the result of an attack on the site and its palace. This is denied by Eric Cline who points out the lack of archaeological evidence for an attack. \nWe see a similar situation in Tiryns in 1200 BC when an earthquake destroyed much of the city including its palace. It is likely however that the city continued to be inhabited for some time following the earthquake. As a result there is a general agreement that earthquakes did not permanently destroy Mycenae or Tiryns because physical destruction cannot fully explain the collapse. The cause of the continued decline of these sites could be environmental. In particular There was a lack of homegrown food. Palaces were important in managing and storing food imports. Their destruction made worse the more crucial factor of food shortage. The importance of trade is further supported by the lack of any evidence for violent or sudden decline in Mycenae.\nThe destruction on Pylos by fire around 1180 suggests a violent destruction to the city. There is some evidence of Pylos expecting a seaborne attack with tablets at Pylos discussing \"Watchers guarding the coast\". The tablets do not give any context as to what is being watched for and why. Regardless of what the threat from the sea was, it likely played a role in the decline. It would have hindered trade and perhaps vital food imports.\nThe end Bronze Age collapse marked the start of a period that has been called the Greek Dark Ages, which lasted for more than 400 years. The occupation of some cities, like Athens, did continue however their existence was of a much different nature. They had a more local sphere of influence, limited trade and an impoverished culture. It took centuries for Greece to recover.\nMesopotamia.\nSeveral cities were destroyed, Assyria lost northwestern cities which were reconquered by Tiglath-Pileser I after his ascension to kingship. Control of the Babylonian and Assyrian regions extended barely beyond the city limits. Babylon was sacked by the Elamites.\nEgypt.\nAfter apparently surviving for a while, the Egyptian Empire collapsed in the mid twelfth century BC (during the reign of Ramesses VI). This led to the Third Intermediate Period, that is, non-dynasty.\nConclusion.\nRobert Drews describes the collapse as \"the worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire\". A number of people have spoken of the cultural memories of the disaster as stories of a \"lost golden age\". Hesiod for example spoke of Ages of Gold, Silver and Bronze, separated from the modern harsh cruel world of the Age of Iron by the Age of Heroes.\nPossible causes of collapse.\nIt was a period associated with the collapse of central authority, a depopulation, particularly of urban areas, the loss of literacy in Anatolia and the Aegean, and its restriction elsewhere, the disappearance of established patterns of long-distance international trade, and increasingly vicious struggles for power.\nThere are various theories put forward to explain the situation of collapse, many of them compatible with each other.\nVolcanos.\nThe Hekla 3 eruption was about this time, and is dated at 1159 BC by Egyptologists and British archeologists.\nEarthquakes.\nEarthquakes tend to occur in sequences or 'storms', where a major earthquake above 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale can set off later earthquakes along the weakened fault line. When a map of earthquake occurrence is superimposed on a map of the sites destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, there is a very close correspondence.\nMigrations and raids.\nEvidence includes the widespread findings of \"Naue II-type swords\" (coming from South-Eastern Europe) throughout the region, and Egyptian records of invading \"northerners from all the lands\". \nThe Ugarit correspondence at the time mentions invasions by tribes of such as the mysterious Sea Peoples. Equally, the last Linear B documents in the Aegean (dating to just before the collapse) reported a large rise in piracy, slave raiding and other attacks, particularly around Anatolia. Later fortresses along the Libyan coast, constructed and maintained by the Egyptians after the reign of Ramesses II, were built to reduce raiding.\nThis theory is strengthened by the fact that the collapse coincides with the appearance in the region of many new ethnic groups. Indo-European tribes such as the Phrygians, Thracians, Macedonians and Dorian Greeks seem to have arrived at this time \u2013 possibly from the north. There also seems to have been widespread migration of the Aramaeans \u2013 possibly from the South-East.\nUltimate reasons for these migrations could include drought, developments in warfare/weaponry, earthquakes or other natural disasters. This means that the migrations theory is not incompatible with the other theories mentioned here.\nIronworking.\nThe Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now Bulgaria and Romania in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.\nLeonard R. Palmer suggested that iron, whilst inferior to bronze weapons, was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller armies of bronze-using chariotry.\nIt now seems that the disruption of long distance trade cut easy supplies of tin, making bronze impossible to make. Older implements were recycled and then iron substitutes were used.\nDrought.\nDrought could have easily precipitated or hastened socio-economic problems and led to wars. More recently Brian Fagan has shown how the diversion of mid-winter storms, from the Atlantic to north of the Pyrenees and the Alps, bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean, was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse.\nChanges in warfare.\nRobert Drews argues that massed infantry used newly developed weapons and armor.192ff Cast rather than forged spearheads and long swords, a revolutionizing cut-and-thrust weapon, and javelins were used. The appearance of bronze foundries suggest \"that mass production of bronze artifacts was suddenly important in the Aegean\". For example, Homer uses \"spears\" as a virtual synonym for \"warrior\", suggesting the continued importance of the spear in combat.\nSuch new weaponry, used by a proto-hoplite model of infantry able to withstand attacks of massed chariotry, would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class. This precipitated an abrupt social collapse as raiders and/or infantry mercenaries began to conquer, loot, and burn the cities.\nGeneral systems collapse.\nA general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture. This theory raises the question of whether this collapse was the cause of, or the effect of, the Bronze Age collapse being discussed.\nIn the Middle East, a variety of factors \u2014 including population growth, soil degradation, drought, cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies \u2014 could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry (compared to arable land) to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies. In complex societies which were increasingly fragile, this combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse.\nThe critical flaws of the late Bronze Age are its centralization, specialization, complexity and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then revealed themselves through revolts, defections, demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors which could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include the aggression of the \u2018Sea Peoples\u2019, the effect of pirates on maritime trade, drought, crop failures, and famine."}

He studied the French horn at the Conservatoire in Dresden and played in a military band. In 1879, he moved to England where he stayed for the rest of his life, becoming the most important horn player in England. The conductor Hans Richter offered him at job in the orchestra at Covent Garden. In 1904, he joined the newly formed London Symphony Orchestra. The four horn players in that orchestra were excellent players and were often called \u201cGod\u2019s Own Quartet\u201d.\nBorsdorf and his colleague Franz Paersch had learned to play on horns that were made in Germany. These had a wide bore (the hole through the tube). However, both players changed to playing instruments made in France by a horn-maker called Raoux. These instruments had a narrower bore. They were not quite as powerful but gave a particularly clear sound.\nBorsdorf became professor at the Royal College of Music when it was founded in 1882. He also taught at the Royal Academy of Music. He soon became the best horn player in London. He was playing principal horn in the orchestra which Henry Wood conducted at the very first Promenade Concert in the Queen\u2019s Hall in 1895 (the fourth horn was A.E.Brain, grandfather of Dennis Brain). He was also in the orchestra when Richard Strauss\u2019s \"Till Eulenspiegel\" was given its first performance in England in 1896 with the composer conducting.\nIn 1913, he became ill and had to have teeth removed. There was also another problem for him: World War I broke out in 1914 and there was a lot of anti-German feeling in England. After the war he rarely played in public.\nBorsdorf died in 1923. He had done more than anyone else to improve the standard of horn playing in England. He taught many talented pupils, including A.E.Brain Jr., Aubrey Brain, Frank Probyn and his own three sons: Oskar, Francis and Emil who all became professional horn players."}

AD 21 in Germania) was a chieftain of the Cherusci. He was able to unite a group of Germanic tribes together to fight the Romans. They destroyed a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. This was the greatest military disaster the Romans had ever suffered.\nAfter the battle, Arminius immediately sent Varus' severed head to Maroboduus, king of the Marcomanni, the other most powerful Germanic ruler. Arminius offered an anti-Roman alliance. Marobod declined the offer, sending the head on to Rome for burial, and remained neutral throughout the ensuing war. Only later did a brief, inconclusive war break out between the two Germanic leaders.\nRome's response.\nLater, in 14 AD, the Roman general Germanicus, nephew of the Emperor Tiberius, led a huge 8-legion army (a legion was up to 5,000 men) into Germania against the coalition of tribes led by Arminius.\nAfter visiting the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where 15/20,000 Romans had been killed in 9 AD, and burying their remains, he launched a massive assault on the heartland of Arminius' tribe, the Cheruscans. \nArminius initially lured Germanicus' cavalry into a trap and inflicted minor casualties, until successful fighting by the Roman infantry caused the Germans to break and flee into the forest. This victory, combined with the fact that winter was fast approaching, meant Germanicus's next step was to lead his army back to its winter quarters on the Rhine.\nIn spite of doubts on the part of his uncle, Emperor Tiberius, Germanicus managed to raise another huge army and invaded Germany again the next year, in 16. He forced a crossing of the Weser near modern Minden, suffering heavy losses. Then he met Arminius' army in an engagement often called the Battle of the Weser River.\nGermanicus's superior tactics and better trained and equipped legions inflicted huge casualties on the German army, with only minor losses. One final battle was fought at the Angivarian Wall west of modern Hanover, repeating the pattern of high German fatalities, forcing them to flee. \nWith his main objectives reached and with winter approaching Germanicus ordered his army back to their winter camps, with the fleet occasioning some damage by a storm in the North Sea. However, only a minute number of Romans died due to this storm. After a few more raids across the Rhine, which resulted in the recovery of two of the three legion's eagles lost in 9, Germanicus was recalled to Rome and informed by Tiberius that he would be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command.\nDeath of Arminius.\nFive years later, Arminius was killed on the orders of rival Germanic chiefs. Although Arminius could not keep unity among the Germanic tribes, the loss of Roman legions in the Teutoburg forest had a far-reaching effect on the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire. Germanicus' campaign was the last major Roman military effort east of the Rhine."}

It was one of the largest earthquakes in Japanese history.\nBackground.\nThe southern coast of Honshu runs in the same direction as the Nankai Trough. This marks the place where the Philippine Sea Plate moves under the Eurasian Plate. Movement on this boundary causes many earthquakes; some of them are megathrust earthquakes. The Nankai megathrust has five parts (A-E) that can break one by one. The different parts have broken either one at a time or all together many times over the last 1,300 years. This kind of quake often happens in pairs with a relatively short time between them. In addition to the two earthquakes in 1854, there were similar earthquakes in 1944 and 1946. Each time, the northeastern part broke before the southwestern part. In 1707, the earthquakes were either at the same time, or close enough together so that writing from that time do not describe them separately.\nDamage.\n29,000 houses were destroyed and more than 5,000 people were killed. The earthquake caused at least one major landslide in Shizuoka. This landslide was one of the three largest in Japan and is called the Ohya Landslide. It covered an area of 1.8\u00a0km2 with an estimated volume of 120 million m3. In the Nara Basin, the earthquake made the soil behave like a liquid.\nCharacteristics.\nEarthquake.\nThere were two other very large earthquakes: the 1854 Ansei-T\u014dkai and Ansei-Nankai earthquakes. The 1707 was stronger than both. Several observations show that the H\u014dei earthquake was bigger. At Cape Muroto, K\u014dchi, a cliff was raised up about 2.3 m in 1707, but just 1.5 m in 1854. In the Kawachi Plain area, the earthquake was around 6 - 7 on the JMA scale. Also, the amount of damage and height of the water from tsunami showed the strength of the earthquake. There are also records of tsunami at distant locations, such as Nagasaki and Jeju-do, South Korea.\nTsunami.\nThe tsunami that followed the earthquake raised water along the coast. Along the southwestern coast of K\u014dchi, the average increase in sea level was 7.7 m. In some places it rose up to 10.2 m\nConnection to Mount Fuji eruption.\nChanges in stress caused by large earthquakes may be enough to cause volcanic eruptions, when the magma system of the volcano is close to a critical state. The great earthquake in 1707 may have changed pressure in the magma under Mount Fuji and might have caused the last eruption of Mount Fuji 49 days later."}

There was no lava flow, but the Hoei eruption released at least 800 million cubic meters of volcanic ash. This ash spread over very large areas around the volcano. It even reached Edo almost 100\u00a0km away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces. This eruption of Mount Fuji might have been caused by the 1707 H\u014dei earthquake\n49 days earlier.\nThe eruption was on Mount Fuji's east\u2013north-east slope and made three new volcanic openings called No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 H\u014dei vents. The danger of the eruption increased over the next several days. After the first earthquake and explosion of cinders and ash, another stronger explosion happened a few days later. This explosion threw out rocks and stones. Mount Fuji has not erupted since; but scientists describe Fuji as an active volcano.\nHokusai's \"One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji\" includes an image of the small crater which developed from a secondary eruption site on the southwestern slope. This was called H\u014deizan (Mount H\u014dei) because the eruption happened in year H\u014dei 4.\nToday the crater can be visited from Fujinomiya Trail or Gotemba Trail of Mount Fuji.\nRelated disasters.\nIn the year after the H\u014dei eruption, another related disaster happened. The Sakawa River flooded. Sand from the volcano fell and widely covered the fields east of Mount Fuji. Farmers made sand piles by dumping the ash and sand from their fields. The rain washed away the sand piles from the dumping grounds and into the rivers again and again. This made some of the rivers shallower, especially the Sakawa. Enough ash had fallen to partly block the river. The ash made temporary dams. Heavy rainfall on August 7 and 8, 1708, caused an avalanche of volcanic ash and mud and broke the dams. The river flooded the Ashigara plain."}

{"id": "272612", "revid": "7674119", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272612", "title": "Titanosaur", "text": "Titanosaurs were a group of large sauropod dinosaurs. Together with the brachiosaurs and relatives they make up the larger clade Titanosauriformes.\nThey were some of the heaviest creatures ever to walk the earth. Titanosaurs included \"Saltasaurus\", \"Isisaurus\", \"Argentinosaurus\" and \"Paralititan\". The group includes the largest land animals known to have existed, such as \"Patagotitan\" estimated at long with a weight of and the comparably sized \"Argentinosaurus\" and \"Puertasaurus\" from the same region. They were named after the mythological Titans of Ancient Greece, \"Abdarainurus\" and \"Aegyptosaurus\".\nThe titanosaurs were the last great group of sauropods before the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. They were the dominant herbivores of their time. The fossil evidence suggests they replaced the other sauropods, like the diplodocids and the brachiosaurids, which died out between the Upper Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous.\nSkeleton.\nBroadly, their skeleton was similar to earlier sauropods, but with a few key differences. The pelvis (hip area) was slimmer than some sauropods, but the pectoral (chest area) was much wider. This them a uniquely 'wide-gauged' stance: their front legs were wider apart, and usually longer than their hind legs. This can be seen very clearly in the \"Argentinosaurus\". As a result, the fossilised trackways of titanosaurs are broader than other sauropods. Their vertebrae (back bones) were solid (not hollowed-out). Their spinal column was more flexible, so they were probably more agile than their cousins and better at rearing up.\nVariety.\nThe group was quite varied. Some of the smaller types did not have longer forelimbs (\"Epachthosaurus\"), and one Chinese find (\"Xinghesaurus\") had an extremely long neck. These differences must reflect adaptations to differences in their habitats and life-style, but at present there is little known about this. Many of these discoveries are quite recent.\nGlobal distribution.\nTitanosaurs were widespread. Their fossils have been found in all continents, even Antarctica. Four well preserved skeletons of a titanosaur species were found in Italy. \nThey were especially numerous in the southern continents (then part of the supercontinent of Gondwana). Australia had titanosaurs around 96 million years ago: fossils have been discovered in Queensland of a creature around 25 meters long (82\u00a0feet). Remains have also been discovered in New Zealand.\nWorld record size.\nTitanosaurs hold the world record for the size of a land animal. One place in the Argentine had 150 bones from seven titanosaurs. The largest were from an animal 40 metres (~130 feet) long and 20 metres (35 feet) tall. It would have weighed about 77 tonnes. A local farm worker stumbled on the remains in the desert near La Flecha, about 250km (135 miles) west of Trelew, Patagonia. The BBC flew a team out to record the event.\nPaleobiology.\nAs a group, titanosaurs were high browsers, eating leaves and branches from tall trees. This is in contrast to other herbivores like the Ceratopsia and Ankylosauria, which were low browsers, eating lower vegetation like shrubs. As a general rule, high browsers can eat lower-growing plants, but low browsers cannot eat from tall trees. Like the earlier sauropods (e.g. \"Diplodocus\") titanosaurs had peg-like teeth and no grinders. This means they used gastroliths to grind their food, and had a huge vat-like stomach where bacteria decomposed it. \nDiet.\nFossilized dung found with late Cretaceous titanosaurids suggests a broad, unselective plant diet. Besides the plant remains that might have been expected, such as cycads and conifers, there were an unexpectedly wide range of monocotyledons, including palms and grasses (Poaceae), including ancestors of rice and bamboo. This has given rise to speculation that herbivorous dinosaurs and grasses co-evolved.\nNesting.\nA large titanosaurid nesting ground was discovered in Auca Mahuevo, in Patagonia, Argentina and another colony has reportedly been discovered in Spain. Several hundred female saltasaurs dug holes with their back feet, laid eggs in clutches averaging around 25 eggs each, and buried the nests under dirt and vegetation. The small eggs, about 11\u201312\u00a0cm (4\u20135\u00a0in) in diameter, contained fossilised embryos, complete with skin impressions. The impressions showed that titanosaurs were covered in a mosaic armour of small bead-like scales. The huge number of individuals suggests herd behavior which, with their armour, could have helped give protection against large contemporary predators such as \"Abelisaurus\"."}

It was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, led by Sparta, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. It took place at the pass of Thermopylae. The battle was fought for over three days, at the same time as the naval Battle of Artemisium.\nContext.\nThe Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece. In 500 BC the lonians settled in the western coast of Asia minor and rose up against Persian\u2019s King Darius. After six years, the rebellion was ended. In 490 BC the Persians sailed to punish the Athens. Darius fought against Athens and promised to punish them because they went to Persian land to help The Ionians. This First Persian War was ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon.\nThe preparation.\nXerxes had a huge army and navy, and in this Second Persian War set out to conquer all of Greece.\nThe Athenian general Themistocles suggested the Greek allies should block the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium.\nA Greek force of about 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the summer of 480 BC. The huge Persian army arrived at the pass in late August or early September.\nThe battle.\nHeavily outnumbered, the Greeks held off the Persians for seven days in total (including three of battle), before the rearguard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands.\nDuring two full days of battle, the small force led by King Leonidas I of Sparta blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day of battle, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path that led behind the Greek lines. Aware that his force was being outflanked, Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Greek army, and remained to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians (who refused to leave), 400 Thebans and perhaps a few hundred others. Most of them were killed.\nThe pass at Thermopylae was thus opened to the Persian army according to Herodotus, at the cost to the Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities. The Greek rearguard meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of battle.\nThe Greek navy.\nAfter this engagement, the Greek navy at Artemisium received news of the defeat at Thermopylae. Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, the Greek navy decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians then captured the evacuated Athens. During the battle the Greek navy lured the Persians into a narrow pass and obliterated at least 200 Persian war ships, thanks to Themistocles.\nSeeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persian fleet attacked, but were defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearing to be trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army of freemen defending native soil. The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds."}

The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.\nAfter the engagement, the Allies received news of the defeat of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Their strategy was to hold both Thermopylae and Artemisium. So, given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now-evacuated Athens.

These areas are important for the survival of species, biodiversity, ecology, conservation, solitude, and recreation. \nWilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, moral, and aesthetic reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity. \nThey may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, gardens or laboratories.\nFrom this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being \"wilderness\". Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered \"wild.\" This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference.\nThe WILD Foundation states that wilderness areas have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and Ib (Wilderness areas). \nProbably no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity, either due to past occupation by indigenous people, or through global processes such as climate change. Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration, also affect the wilderness.\nEspecially in richer , industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by law. Many nations have designated wilderness, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. \nMany new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various Parliaments and Legislatures at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that \"in the end, dedicated, inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society, preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us\"."}

It has a mostly Albanian population, but also some Serbs. It is in the north-eastern part of Kosovo, close to the Goljak mountains.\nHistory.\nIn ancient history, the Vin\u010da culture lived in the area. The city was part of the Roman Empire between 28 BC and 850 AD. After that, the Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires fought for control, taking Kosovo back and forth, between 850 and 1180. Then it became part of the Kingdom of Serbia. For most of that time, it was the capital of Serbia. When the Serbs lost the Battle of Kosovo, the Ottoman Empire took the city. They brought Islam to Kosovo. While Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire, most Albanians became Muslims. Some Slavs did too. In the 1680s, the Austrian Empire conquered Kosovo for a short time, but it was retaken by the Ottomans. \nIn 1912, Albanian rebels led by Hasan Pristina took the city. A few months later, the Kingdom of Serbia captured Pristina. Then, in the Second Balkan War, the Bulgarian Empire took Pristina from Serbia. Then, in December 1918, French colonial troops took Pristina, and gave it to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was now known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. In the next years, Serbs would take Turkish land and property by force. Most Turks left, and some Albanians did too. \nOn 17 April 1941, Yugoslavia surrendered to the Axis Powers. On 29 June, Benito Mussolini said that there would be a Greater Albania, and that Kosovo would be a part of it. After that, Italian and Albanian fascists killed lots of Serbs, and tens of thousands left Kosovo. After Italy switched sides to the Allied Powers, Nazi Germany took control of Pristina. 281 local Jews were arrested by an Albanian Schutzstaffel (SS) division. They were sent to Germany, where many were killed. Due to the chaos caused by World War II, as well as many people being forced to leave, Pristina's population dropped to 9,631 people.\nAfter World War II, Yugoslavia became a communist country. Large parts of the town were destroyed to try to make room for new buildings, including most of the town center. This included a lot of buildings that had been built by the Ottomans. Pristina got a lot of money from the Yugoslav government because it was the capital of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, so it developed quickly. The University of Pristina was founded, lots of high-rise apartment blocks were built, and a new industrial zone near the city attracted a lot of people from other parts of Kosovo. Pristina's population increased very quickly, from 69,514 in 1971 to 109,208 in 1981. But this period of quick growth was soon ended by an economic and social crisis. After Tito died, the many different ethnic groups in Yugoslavia started having troubles with each other. This included the Serbs and Albanians."}
{"id": "272813", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272813", "title": "Boeing 717", "text": "The Boeing 717 is a jet airliner. It has two engines, which means that it is a twinjet. It also only has two columns of seats, which makes it a narrow-body plane. The Boeing 717 was designed and sold by McDonnell Douglas. It was called the MD-95, which was designed from the DC-9. The 717 can hold up to 117 passengers. It can fly for . The 717 has two Rolls-Royce BR715 turbofan engines.\nThe first MD-95 was ordered in October 1995. Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997, which was before the first MD-95 was made. The first plane was finished in 1999, and it was called the Boeing 717. Boeing stopped making 717s in May 2006. 156 were made.\nDevelopment.\nBackground.\nDouglas Aircraft made their DC-9 to fly with the DC-8 in the early 1960s. The DC-9 was a brand new design. It had two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D turbofan engines at the back of the plane and a small wing. The DC-9 first flew in 1965. Airlines began to use it later that year. 976 DC-9s were made.\nThe McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series was finished in 1980. The MD-80 was the second family of DC-9. It was a longer version of the DC-9-50, and it had more fuel and new engines. Nearly 1,200 MD-80s were made from 1980 to 1999.\nThe MD-90 was designed from the MD-80 series. It first flew in 1993. The MD-90 was longer and had a glass cockpit. It also had new IAE V2525-D5 engines. Only 117 MD-90s were made.\nMD-95.\nIn early 1994, the MD-95 was designed by McDonnell Douglas. The plane was long and it had a wingspan of span. McDonnell Douglas said that it thought the MD-95 would become a family of aircraft.\nThe MD-95 was made to replace the DC-9. The MD-95 had new engines, cockpit and it was more modern.\nScandinavian Airlines System (SAS) decided to use the Boeing 737-600 instead of the MD-95 in March 1995. Then in October 1995, ValuJet bought 50 MD-95s. McDonnell Douglas thought that starting to make the MD-95 after this small order would be fine. The ValuJet order was the only order for the MD-95 for two years.\nEngines.\nThe MD-95 was supposed to have a type of JT8D-200 engine. It could also have had the Rolls-Royce Tay 670. McDonnell Douglas said that the MD-95 would not cost much to make, because it was so similar to the MD-90.\nMcDonnell Douglas thought that the BMW Rolls-Royce BR700 engine was better than the others, so on February 23, 1994, it was chosen to be the plane's engine.\nMaking.\nMcDonnell Douglas was going to make all MD-95s in China. However, in 1994, McDonnell Douglas began to look for a cheap place to make the planes. Halla Group in South Korea was made the wings of the plane, Alenia of Italy made the fuselage, Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. of Taiwan make the tail; and a part of Korea Air Lines made the nose and cockpit.\nName change.\nAfter Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas in August 1997, many people thought that Boeing would cancel the MD-95. However, Boeing decided to keep making it, but call it something else: the Boeing 717. A United States Air Force plane was called the \"717-100\" and the airliner was called the \"717-200\". The lack of a widespread use of the 717 name left it available to rebrand the MD-95.\nAt first, Boeing was not very successful at selling the 717. The first Boeing 717s began to be made in May 1997.\nA small Australian airline bought many 717s, but it was eventually merged with Qantas. This meant that Qantas had some 717s that it did not want.\nHowever, Qantas soon saw that the 717 was quite good. It was bigger and faster than the BAe 146, which Qantas was using at the time. It was also cheaper to use. Many airlines which used the 717s, including Qantas, began to buy more. Qantas bought more 717s, as well as Hawaiian Airlines and Midwest Airlines.\nThe 717's main rivals are the Airbus A318 and the Embraer E-195.\nEnd of making.\nIn December 2003, Boeing lost a US$ 2.7 billion contract from Air Canada. Air Canada bought the Embraer E-Jets and Bombardier CRJ instead of the 717. In January 2005, Boeing said it would stop making the 717 after the last planes had been built.\nThe last 717 was finished in April 2006 for AirTran Airways. AirTran got the first and last 717. The last two Boeing 717s were for AirTran and Midwest Airlines. They were delivered on May 23, 2006. The 717 was the last airliner made at Boeing's Long Beach factory in California.\nDesign.\nThe 717 has a glass cockpit. The cockpit design is called the Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF). The MD-11 has the same one.\nThe 717 can make Category IIIb ILS landings. The 717 has the same type rating as the DC-9. This means that pilots of the DC-9 can also fly the 717.\nMcDonnell Douglas does not have airstairs at the back of the plane. This was done so that the plane would use less fuel.\nDifferent types of Boeing 717.\nIn 1993, McDonnell Douglas wanted to make three types of 717 (MD-95):\nBoeing 717 Business Express.\nBoeing 717 Business Express would have been a type of 717-200 to be used as a private jet. This version is made with the BBJ family.\nTypes which were not made.\nBoeing 717-100 (-100X): A smaller version with 86 seats. It was cancelled in 2003.\nBoeing 717-100X Lite: A smaller version with 75 seats. It would have had Rolls-Royce Deutschland BR 710 engines. It was cancelled.\nBoeing 717-300X: The other name for the MD-95-50. Delta Air Lines, Iberia and Northwest Airlines were said to be interested in this type.\nUsers.\nIn July 2012, 143 Boeing 717-200s were being used. The airlines using it were Southwest Airlines (88), Hawaiian Airlines (18), Cobham Aviation Services Australia (13), Blue1 (9), Volotea (9), and Turkmenistan Airlines (6). Delta Air Lines will get 88 717s from Southwest Airlines in 2013.\nAccidents.\nAs of March 2009, the Boeing 717 has had five accidents. Nobody has died in these, and there have been no hull-loss accidents. A hull-loss accident is an accident where the plane is damaged so much that it cannot be repaired, or if the plane is completely destroyed.\nDetails.\nSources: Boeing 717 Characteristics 717 Airport planning report Boeing 717 Specifications"}

The average male weigh 630 grams (22\u00a0oz) and female weigh 800 grams (28\u00a0oz). It has a round head with dark brown eyes while most owls in the eastern United States have yellow eyes. The barred owl lives about 10 to 12 years in the wild.\nHabitat.\nThe barred owl lives in the woods across the eastern United States, southern Canada and Alaska. They sometimes migrate to Central America in the winter. The great horned owl is the only predator of the barred owl.\nReproduction.\nThe barred owl makes nests on tree limbs and are usually near ponds or lakes. They may use nests that have been left by other animals. They can lay 1 to 5 eggs. Eggs hatch in 28 days and the young begin to fly 42 days later. \nDiet.\nThe barred owl eats rabbits, squirrels, bats, snakes, and small insects. They are able to find food from a far distance from its great hearing sense. They can also hunt fish."}

The higher the resistance, the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current. The formula is:\nformula_5, where V is the voltage, R is the resistance, and I is the current.\nIn the case of impedance, an inductor resists changes to the current and the capacitor resists changes to the voltage.\nThe key difference between resistance and impedance is the word \"change\", the rate of change affects the impedance. Usually the \"change\" is expressed as a frequency, the number of times per second the current or voltage change direction. The formulas are:\nFor the inductor:\nformula_6\nFor the capacitor:\nformula_7\nWhere Z is the symbol for impedance, j is the imaginary number formula_8, formula_9 is the constant pi, f is the frequency, L is the inductance and C is the capacitance. The units for the resistance and the impedance are the same, the ohm with the symbol formula_10 (capital omega).\nAs indicated by the formulas above, the impedance varies depending on the frequency, for example, at zero Hertz, or DC, the impedance of the inductor is zero, the same as a short-circuit, and the impedance of the capacitor is infinite, the same as an open-circuit. Most signals are the sum of many sine waves at various frequencies (see the fourier transform for more details), and each of them experience a different impedance.\nSimilarly to the resistance, the higher the impedance, the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current. The formula is:\nformula_11, where V is the voltage, Z is the impedance, and I is the current.\nAt the physical level, simplifying many things:\nOne important difference between the resistance and the impedance is that a resistor dissipates energy, it gets hot, but an inductor and a capacitor store the energy and can return that energy to the source when it goes down.\nIf the impedance of the source, cable and load are not all equal, then a fraction of the signal is reflected back to the source, wasting power and creating interference. The ratio of the can be calculated with:\nAny medium that can have a wave has a wave impedance, even empty space (light is an electro-magnetic wave and it can travel in space) has an impedance of about .\nPhase.\nAcross a resistor, both the voltage and the current goes up and down at the same time, they are said to be in phase, but with an impedance it's different, the voltage is shifted by 1/4 wavelength behind the current in a capacitor, and forward in an inductor.\nA 1/4 wavelength is usually represented with the imaginary number \"j\", which is also equivalent to a 90 degree shift.\nThe use of the imaginary number \"j\" makes the mathematics much simpler, it allows to calculate the total impedance the same way as it's done with resistors, for example a resistor plus an impedance in series is R+Z, and in parallel it's (R*Z)/(R+Z)."}

It is in Montezuma County, Colorado, United States. The park was created in 1906 to protect some of the best preserved cliff dwellings in the world. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \nThe park occupies 81.4 square miles (211 square kilometers) near the Four Corners and features ruins of homes and villages built by the ancestral Puebloan people, sometimes called the Anasazi. The ancestral Puebloans made these stone villages their home in the 13th century. However, the first ancestral Puebloans had settled in Mesa Verde over 600 years before the cliff dwellings were ever built.\nThese first people are known as the Basketmakers and they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in the overhangs of the cliffs. These hunter-gatherer people settled and began farming and using the bow and arrow, a weapon that was more efficient and accurate than the atlatl. By 750 AD, the people were building mesa-top villages made of adobe. By the late 12th century they began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is famous.\nMesa Verde is best known for cliff dwellings, which are structures built within caves and under outcropping in cliffs \u2014 including Cliff Palace, which is thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America. The Spanish term \"Mesa Verde\" translates into English as \"green table\". Approximately 600 of the over 4700 archeological sites found in Mesa Verde National Park are cliff dwellings.\nGeography.\nMesa Verde National Park is in the south-western corner of the state of Colorado.\nElevations in the park range from about . The terrain is dominated by ridges and valleys running roughly north and south. The northernmost point is 13.2 miles (21.2 kilometers) farther north than the southernmost.\nHistory.\nAlthough explorers from Spain went through the general region in the 18th century, actual sight of the cliffs dwellings by outsiders seems to have first occurred in the latter half of the 19th century. \nThe fame of Mesa Verde soon began to spread thanks to the Wetherill ranchers and the archeological work of Gustaf Nordenski\u00f6ld. Vandalism led to President Teddy Roosevelt's support of protecting the area as a national park in 1906."}

After a South Korean artillery practice on the island, North Korea fired about 170 shells at Yeonpyeong. The shelling damaged the island greatly. It killed four South Koreans and hurt 19. At this, South Korea shelled North Korean gun positions. North Koreans said that they had fired the shells because they heard South Korean shells being fired into the North Korean part of the sea. Many nations disapproved of what the North did, and the tension (angry feelings) in Korea grew. The United Nations said that it was one of the most serious things that had happened after the end of the Korean War.\nHistory.\nSouth Korea and the United States began the Hoguk exercise which they did every year. The Hoguk exercise was a large military practice with both South Korean and US militaries. The 2010 exercise used 70,000 soldiers from all four kinds of the South Korean military. They had 600 land vehicles, 90 helicopters, 50 warships, and 500 aircraft. The North Korean government felt that these exercises were a preparation for attacking the North, though the South and US said it was not.\nEngagement.\nOn the morning of 23 November, North Korea said that it complained to the South, \"asking whether (the [Hoguk] exercise) was an attack against the North\". It said that it would not allow firing in what the North thought was its part of the sea. South Korean forces practiced firing in waters near Baengnyeong Island and Yeonpyeong Island in South Korean waters. According to a South Korean military official, the shells were fired towards waters in the south, away from North Korea. The firing was not part of the Hoguk exercise. It was a practice they did every month.\nAt 14:34 in Korean time, North Korea moved 22-mm Multiple Launch Rocket System shells towards an artillery place in Kaemori. Then it began firing on the island of Yeonpyeong. The firing went on 14:34 to 14:55 and again from 15:10 to 15:41. Many of the shells destroyed homes and shops. When they saw this, South Korea used 15mm self-propelled howitzers to fire about 80 shells at the North. The firing ended at about 16:42. It was the first artillery battle between North and South Korea since the 1970s. It was thought to be one of the most serious attacks by the North on the South since the Korean War ended.\nSeveral fires began because of the North Korean shelling, so the South Korean military moved civilians away from Yeonpyeong.\nDamage.\nTwo South Korean soldiers, Hasa (Sergeant) Seo Jeong-wu and Ilbyeong (Private First Class) Moon Gwang-wuk, were killed. Six other people in the military were seriously hurt. Two workers on the island, Kim Chi-baek, who was 61, and Bae Bok-chul, who was 60, were also killed. Many parts of the island were put on fire because of the attack. Most of the people living on the island were moved after the shelling. From the 1,780 people living there, about 1,500 moved away. Many of them moved to Incheon on the mainland. The Incheon city sent 22 fire engines and ambulances to the island."}

It was the largest airport in Chicago before O'Hare International Airport was built. It is on the South Side of Chicago in Garfield Ridge and in Clearing.\nHistory.\nOriginally named Chicago Air Park, Midway Airport was built on a plot in 1923 with one cinder runway that primarily served airmail services. In 1926 the city leased the airport for commercial purposes. The airport was designated as Chicago Municipal Airport on December 12, 1927. By 1928 the airport had twelve hangars and four runways, lit for night operations.\nIn 1931 a new passenger terminal opened at 62nd St; the following year the airport claimed to be the \"World's Busiest\" with over 100,846 passengers on 60,947 flights. The March 1939 OAG shows 47 weekday departures: 13 on United, 13 American, 9 TWA, 4 Northwest and two each on Eastern, Braniff, Pennsylvania Central and C&amp;S. New York's airport (Newark, then LaGuardia by the end of 1939) was then the busiest airline airport in the United States, but Midway passed LaGuardia in 1948 and kept the title until 1960.\nMore construction was funded in part by $1\u00a0million from the Works Progress Administration; the airport expanded to fill the square mile in 1938\u201341 after a court ordered the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad to reroute tracks that had crossed the square along the north edge of the older field.\nIncidents.\nOn June 30, 1956, United Airlines Flight 718, a Douglas DC-7, was headed for Midway Airport. Over the Grand Canyon it collided with a TWA Super Constellation, killing all 128 people on both planes. This became the impetus for the modern air traffic control system.\nOn December 8, 1972, United Airlines Flight 553, a Boeing 737-200, crashed into a residential area outside Midway during landing. The crash of the 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 on board, and two on the ground.\nExactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, slid off the runway while attempting to land at the airport in a heavy snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest at the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.\nExactly 14 years later, on December 8, 2019, rapper Juice Wrld died after suffering a seizure at the airport.\nAirlines.\nThe following airlines use Chicago Midway International Airport:"}

He wrote several best-selling novels including \"Lost Horizon\" and \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\". \"Lost Horizon\" introduced an imaginary place called Shangri-La and made it popular.\nBiography.\nJames Hilton was born in Leigh. His father, John Hilton, was the headmaster of Chapel End School in Walthamstow. James Hilton partially based the character Mr. Chipping in \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" on his father.\nHilton wrote his two most famous books while living in an ordinary semi-detached house on Oak Hill Gardens, Woodford Green. The house is still there, and a small, blue sign says it was Hilton's home.\nHe was married twice, first to Alice Brown and later to Galina Kopineck. Both marriages ended in divorce. He died in Long Beach, California from liver cancer.\nNovels.\nHilton became a successful writer when he was still young. He published his first novel, \"Catherine Herself,\" when he was 20 years old. Several of his books were international bestsellers. Some successful films were made based on his novels. Three of the best known movies are: \"Lost Horizon\" (1933), \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (1934), and \"Random Harvest\" (1941). Many copies of \"Lost Horizon\" were sold in the 1930s as one of the first Pocket Books. The serial number was \"1\". Some people call it the novel that began the popularity of paperback books.\nLost Horizon.\n\"Lost Horizon\" is supposedly set in Tibet, and especially in a secret, imaginary valley called Shangri-La. Shangri-La now means any perfect, pleasurable place or utopia.\nIt is unsure exactly where and how Hilton got his ideas about Tibet. He may have been inspired to write \"Lost Horizon\" and to invent Shangri-La\" by reading the \"National Geographic Magazine\" by Joseph Rock. Rock was an Austrian-American botanist and ethnologist who explored southwestern China and areas near Tibet. Hilton have also read articles by early travelers in Tibet that he found in the British Library for more ideas Christian Zeeman may also have been the model for the hero of the story. He disappeared while living in Japan and there were rumors that he was living secretly in a Zen Buddhist monastery. Some say that the isolated valley town of Weaverville, California, in far northern Trinity County, was Shangri-La. However, this is a misunderstanding of a comment by Hilton in a 1941 interview. In that interview, Hilton said that Weaverville reminded him of Shangri-La. Coincidentally, Junction City (about 8 miles from Weaverville) now has a Tibetan Buddhist centre with the occasional Tibetan monks in saffron robes.\nAfter the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt told the press that the airplanes had taken off from Shangri-La. This was a kind of joke to hide the secret that they had taken off from aircraft carriers. Later, the US Navy gave that name to an aircraft carrier, and Roosevelt named his Maryland presidential retreat \"Shangri-La\". (That retreat is now called Camp David since President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed it after his grandson.) Zhongdian is a mountain region of Southwest China that has now been renamed Shangri-La (Xianggelila) because it may have inspired Hilton's book \nWork in Hollywood.\nHilton lived and worked in Hollywood beginning in the mid-1930s. He won an Academy Award in 1942 for his work on the screenplay of \"Mrs. Miniver\". That film was based on the novel by Jan Struther. Hilton was the host of \"The Hallmark Playhouse\" (1948\u20131953) for CBS Radio. One of his later novels, \"Morning Journey\", was about the movie business.\nOther versions of his works.\nSome of Hilton's novels became films:\nHilton co-wrote the book and lyrics for \"Shangri-La\", an unsuccessful 1956 Broadway musical adaptation of \"Lost Horizon\"."}

After this, Fred wants to sing a song with Judy, but after trying to sneak his way into her house, he discovers that she has moved. So Fred goes on a journey to find Judy's new house. While looking, Fred runs into different characters, including a talking deer, a lost childhood friend who had disappeared in the forest years earlier, a neighborhood girl named Bertha who's friends with Fred, and a boy with a personality opposite to his own named Derf. \nWhen he arrives at Judy's home, he discovers that she is hosting a party to which he was never invited. He is bullied by her guests who are bullies of him for his poor social status at school and strange personality. After vomiting on Judy's party dress, Fred leaves the house. He is angry to find that Kevin has posted a video of him vomiting on Judy online, so he decides to throw a party of his own and not invite anybody to get revenge. In order to trick others into believing that he has had a spectacular house party, Fred invites Bertha to his house where they dress up mannequins in different outfits and play around. After Fred edits the video of the fake party, he posts it on the internet, where his schoolmates watch it and believe that Fred and Bertha actually had a really good party. After watching the video, different students at Fred's school say how awesome Fred and Bertha are (except Kevin, who claims the party was \"lame\"). Some students say they actually went to the party. Soon, Judy visits Fred's house and asks if the two may sing together, and Fred accepts the request.\nF\u042fED 2: The Night of the Living F\u042fED.\nIn school, Fred finds out his music teacher, who had trouble hearing, has been replaced by Mr. Devlin. Mr. Devlin cleans up and throws away a hearing aide, which is suspicious. While walking home with his friend, Bertha, he sees a girl, Talia following them. Fred thinks he is being stalked, so he runs home. Later, Fred notices Mr. Devlin is his new neighbor. Fred is now afraid of Mr. Devlin, thinking he may be a vampire.\nAt school, Devlin asks everyone to join a musical community. Fred thinks that Devlin is trying to turn everyone into a vampire by having them take his lessons, and everyone is joining. That night, Fred spies on him and sees him burying what he believes is a body. Meanwhile, Talia vanishes, making him think she was a ghost. Kevin's mom then invites them to a party. It is then found out that Talia is Kevin's sister. The next day, Mr. Devlin, takes Fred's mom on a date. This worries Fred.\nFred asks Bertha to help prove Mr. Devlin is a vampire. Fred and Bertha spy on Mr. Devlin and Fred's mom at a restaurant. Mr. Devlin orders a bloody steak making Bertha more suspicious. Later that night, Fred falls from his window because Mr. Devlin sees him as he is trying to get away. Later, Fred goes around and puts up crucifixes to fend off Devlin, as vampires hate all things holy. Derf tells Fred to face his fears and defeat Devlin, so Fred buys garlic sauce. At the piano recital that night, Fred squirts the garlic sauce on everyone, including Talia. \nAfterwards, Mr. Devlin invites him to his house for dinner so that they can \"bury the hatchet\". Fred sets up a live video stream from his phone so he can prove that Devlin is a vampire. Inside Devlin's house, Fred discovers a secret butchers' room behind a wall filled with meat and bones. Devlin creeps in with a long knife and a tall head-dress, scaring Fred. Fred then drops his phone into a pot of boiling liquid. The video freezes on Devlin. This image of Devlin in his headdress makes everyone who sees it think that he is a vampire. But after Devlin talks about his weird hobbies, Fred now begins to like Devlin.\nEveryone at school sees his video, so they believe that Devlin is a vampire, too. He runs to Devlin's house to apologize but Devlin is too depressed to answer. Mr. Devlin gets fired and says that he will have to sell his house and move. Fred feels guilty and tries to fix things by making them think he is the vampire. Bertha and Talia both help, as Talia reveals how much she hates her brother. Kevin and his friends go to Devlin's house because they think he has Talia. Devlin tells them that vampires are not real, but Bertha comes out and says, \"Vampires are real, but it's not Devlin. It's him!\" Then, Fred walks out of the garage carrying Talia, threatening to turn her into a vampire too. Bertha makes Kevin stab Fred, and he gets sprayed with fake blood. Devlin sees Fred and accepts his apology. Devlin says he quit his job and sold his house of his own choice. Then, as Fred's mom and Devlin are going out for dinner, Fred looks in the mirror and sees that Mr. Devlin has no reflection. This means he was a vampire after all, and Fred screams in terror as the movie ends.\nFRED 3: Camp FRED.\nThere is a third Fred film called \"Fred 3: Camp Fred\".

He started a studio that would encourage and help young artists. He and his friend worked at Production I.G. The company president agreed to help Mashimo with his plan and helped start it. The first few years the two studios worked together on anime based on popular video games then Bee Train studio grew big enough to work more on its own. The studio was given a project of short videos to tie in with a new video game series called .hack (said as \"dot hack\"). In addition to the new set of videos the studio was also given a 26 episode television series. The next years would be met with new additions to the game series and the studio's famous \"girls-with-guns\" trilogy. Bee Train became independent in 2006. The two studios still have a good relationship with each other and work together on projects occasionally. From 2009 to 2010, the studio expanded to include two new areas called C-Station and D-Station. Bee Train also has another small office called Studio Road. Studio Road does the color work for anime."}

He is Europe's oldest natural human mummy, and has offered a new picture of Chalcolithic (Copper Age) Europeans. \nBorder issues.\n\u00d6tzi was found on a mountain ridge, at the border between Austria and Italy. After the First World War, Austria had to give the southern part of Tyrol to Italy; it is now known as Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol. At the time, the border was fixed on the watershed of that ridge. The problem with this is that the ridge is usually covered by a glacier, which was also the case in 1919 and 1920. When the border was fixed, the expert team supposed that the watershed was straight below the glacier. The border was fixed that way in 1922 and 1926. The body was found on the Austrian side of the slope. Measurements were done in 1993; they showed that the border is in fact 93 metres from the place where \u00d6tzi was found, on Italian territory. Since 2006, there is a new contract which fixes the border between Austria and Italy: In the case of glaciers, the border is taken on the surface of the glacier, and no longer on the watershed below. This also means that the border is now variable, and depending on the state of the glacier, the place where \u00d6tzi was found is in Austria or in Italy.\n\u00d6tzi's body and belongings are now displayed in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano in the Southern Tyrol (Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol).\nRewarding the finders.\nThere was also a long legal struggle by the finders, plaintiffs Helmut and Erika Simon, for a suitable reward. After many court hearings, the provincial government agreed to pay Erika Simon \u20ac150,000. By that time 17 years had passed, and her husband was dead.\nCause of death.\nIn 2001 X-rays and a CT scan revealed that \u00d6tzi had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder when he died, and a matching small tear on his coat. \nThe discovery of the arrowhead led researchers to think \u00d6tzi died of blood loss from the wound, which would likely have been fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. \nFurther research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest. Cerebral trauma suggested a blow to the head. One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death. \nAt present it is believed that death was caused by a blow to the head. Researchers are unsure if this was due to a fall, or from being struck with a rock by another person.\nTattoos.\n\u00d6tzi exhibits the oldest preserved tattoos in the world. These include 61 marks made from fireplace soot and ash. There were groups of short, parallel, vertical lines to both sides of the lumbar spine, cross-shaped marks on his right knee and right ankle, and parallel lines on his left wrist. \nX-ray examination of his bones showed \"age-conditioned or strain-induced degeneration\" in these areas. These tattoos may have been related to pain relief treatments similar to acupuncture.\nIf so, this is at least 2000 years before their previously known earliest use in China (c. 1000 BC). \n\u00d6tzi's DNA.\nDNA sequence analysis has shown that \u00d6tzi had brown eyes, blood type 'O', was lactose intolerant, and was likely to suffer heart disease. He was more closely related to modern Corsicans and Sardinians than to populations in the Alps, where he was discovered. His ancestors probably came from the Middle East as agriculture became more widespread. He was also the first known case of a person infected by the Lyme disease bacterium. He was middle-aged."}

This was a Christian spiritual movement of the Middle Ages. People are still alive in southern Europe who come from this movement. Because not much was written down about Waldo while he was alive, people do not agree how important he was to the Waldensians, because it may have been around before his leadership. Also, the French historian Thuanus thought Waldo died in the year 1179.\nLife and work.\nNot many details are known about the life of Waldo. Some sources say that he was a rich man who sold clothes, and that he was a merchant from Lyon. Also, sources say that he had some education. Sometime not long before the year 1160 he was inspired by some events. One of these was hearing a sermon on the life of St. Alexius. Another was when saying that one did not believe in transubstantiation (which is the belief that, during Communion, the bread and wine turn into the body and blood of Jesus Christ) became a crime for which one could be punished by death. A third event was the sudden death of a friend during an evening meal. After this, he began living a radical Christian life. He gave his property to his wife. He gave the rest of his things to the poor.\nAt about this time, Waldo began to preach and teach publicly about his ideas of living simple lives and about poverty. He taught that \"No man can serve two masters, God and money\", (see Gospel of Matthew 6:24) and strongly criticized things done by the Pope and things taught by the Roman Catholic Church. Some of the things taught by the Catholic Church that he criticized were purgatory and transubstantiation. He said that the Roman Catholic Church was the prostitute from the book of Revelation. By 1170, many people were following him. These people were called \"the Poor of Lyon\", \"the Poor of Lombardy\", or \"the Poor of God\" who would spread their teaching abroad while dressed up as peddlers. Often called the Waldensians (or Waldenses), they were different from the Albigensians or Cathari.\nThe Waldensian movement had lay preaching (people who were not preachers or priests for a living preached), people who were poor by choice, and strictly obeying the Bible. Between 1175-1185, Waldo either had a cleric from Lyons translate the New Testament of the Bible into the language that most people spoke, the Arpitan (Franco-Proven\u00e7al) language, or translate it himself.\nIn 1179, Waldo and one of his followers went to Rome, where they were welcomed by Pope Alexander III, and the Roman Curia. They had to explain what they believed in front of a panel of three clergymen, including issues which were then debated within the Church. These included the idea that all people were priests, teaching the gospel in the language most people spoke, and people living poor, simple lives on purpose. The results of the meeting were inconclusive, and Waldo's ideas, but not the movement itself, were condemned at the Third Lateran Council in the same year, although the leaders of the movement had not been yet excommunicated (kicked out of the Church).\nSent away from Lyon, Waldo and his followers moved to the high valleys of Piedmont, and in France, in the Luberon. Finally, Waldo was excommunicated by Pope Lucius III during the synod held at Verona in 1184, and the doctrine of the Poor of Lyon was again condemned by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 where they are mentioned by name for the first time, and called heresy. The Roman Catholic Church began to persecute the Waldensians, and many were tried and sentenced to death in different European countries during the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries. The Waldensians survived by moving the Alps and hiding there. Centuries after his death, the Waldensian denomination joined the Genevan or Reformed branch of the Protestant Reformation."}

They wanted to support the White Russians against the Bolshevik Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Other places included Northwest Russia, Crimea, Bessarabia, and the Caucasus.\nHaving occupied the Russian Maritime Provinces, the Allied Forces left by 1920. The Imperial Japanese Army stayed in Siberia until 1922. \nBackground.\nThe Siberian Intervention came quickly after the Russian October Revolution of 1917. The new Bolshevik government signed a separate peace treaty with Germany. That was a serious problem for the Entente powers. The treaty ended fighting for the Germans facing Russia. Germany could then move soldiers from east to west; against Europe. The peace agreement also allowed Germany to get many supplies from Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok. In addition, a 50,000 man Czech Legion had been fighting on the side of the Allies. They became trapped. The Czechs were trying to fight their way out to the east to Vladivostok along the Trans-Siberian Railway. However, the Bolsheviks controlled that railway.\nGreat Britain and France decided to use military power and join the Russian Civil War against the Bolshevik government because of all of those problems. They had three goals: \nThe British and French did not have enough soldiers, so the asked the United States to help. They asked the U.S. to send soldiers to both the North Russia Campaign and the Siberian Campaign. President Wilson agreed in July 1918 even though the War Department said not to help. The U.S. sent two groups of soldiers: 5,000 soldiers were the American North Russia Expeditionary Force (nicknamed the Polar Bear Expedition); and 10,000 were called the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. In the same month, the Russian White movement asked the Beiyang government of the Republic of China to send men. They sent 2,000 soldiers by August. The Chinese later occupied Outer Mongolia and Tuva. They sent a battalion to the North Russian Campaign to fight against the Bolsheviks.\nActive countries.\nBritain.\nThe British had few soldiers sending only 1,500 troops to Siberia. These soldiers came from 9th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment and the 25th Battalion Middlesex Regiment.\nCanada.\nThe Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force was commanded by Major General James H. Elmsley. The Canadian government approved the mission in August 1918. The Canadian soldiers were sent to Vladivostok to support the allied armies already there. There were 4,192 soldiers in the group. They returned to Canada between April and June 1919. The Canadians did little fighting. Fewer than 100 troops left the base area to go to Omsk. Those 100 worked as administrative staff for 1,500 British troops who were helping the White Russian government of Admiral Alexander Kolchak. Most Canadians stayed in Vladivostok. They did routine practice and worked as police in the unstable port city.\nItaly.\nThe Italian soldiers were most active in three areas: Irkutsk, Harbin, and Vladivostok.\nJapan.\nThe Imperial Japanese Army sent 70,000 troops.\nUnited States.\nThe American Expeditionary Force Siberia was commanded by Major General William S. Graves. At its largest, it was 7,950 officers and enlisted men.\nAllied intervention (1918-1919).\nThe Allies began to work together in Siberia in August 1918. The Japanese entered through Vladivostok and places along the Manchurian border. They sent more 70,000 soldiers. The Allies worried about Japanese plans because they sent such a large group. On September 5, the Japanese met the leading group of the Czech Legion. A few days later the British, Italian and French groups joined the Czechs to try to restart the war in the east. They tried to make a new battle line beyond the Ural Mountains. This meant that the European allies moved west. The Japanese had their own goals. They would not go west of Lake Baikal and stayed behind. The Americans were suspicious of Japanese plans.They also stayed behind to watch the Japanese. By November, the Japanese controlled all ports and major towns in the Russian Maritime Provinces and in Siberia east of the city of Chita.\nIn the summer of 1918 onwards, the Japanese army supported White Russian groups; the 5th infantry division and the Japanese-backed Special Manchurian Detachment of Grigory Semyonov took control over Transbaikalia. They started a White Transbaikalia government, but it did not last long."}

Theoretically, this is the shortest time measurement that is possible. Planck time is roughly 10\u221244 seconds. However, to date, the smallest time interval that was measured was 10\u221221 seconds, a \"zeptosecond.\"\nOne Planck time is the time it would take a photon travelling at the speed of light to cross a distance equal to one Planck length.\nIt is calculated from the Planck constant, which was first thought of by the physicist Max Planck in 1900. This work by Planck asserts that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, and their relation can be put in terms of familiar units such as the joule by using the proportionality constant Planck gave us. Heisenberg's original quantum theory was improved by his teacher and colleague Max Born. \nBorn put Heisenberg's equation into a matrix form. Born immediately noticed that to calculate using these matrices, one matrix had to be multiplied by another matrix. In matrix multiplication, multiplying matrix P by matrix X gives a different result from the one obtained by multiplying matrix X by matrix P. He further noticed that the difference between the two matrices involves h, the Planck proportionality constant. It shows that one can never pin down things like P (momentum) and X (location) exactly. As a result, we cannot pin down a time any better than we can pin down a place or a momentum. We get closer and closer and then we reach the \"Planck time.\""}

The artist paints the picture with hundreds of tiny dots, mainly of red, yellow, blue and green, with white. The eye and mind of the viewer mix the colours to make different shades of these colours, as well as orange, purple, pink, and brown depending on the way the dots of colour are arranged. \nGeorges Seurat, at first an Impressionist painter, and Paul Signac, developed this technique in 1886. Other important artists were Camille Pissarro and, in some paintings, Vincent van Gogh. Art critics who saw their work, laughed at it and called it \"Pointillism\" as an insult. This name is still used, but is no longer thought of as an insult.\nTraditionally, artists blend pigments (mix colours) on a palette. Pointillist painters do not mix the colours on the palette at all they just use the colours straight from the tube. Traditional painters, and also impressionist painters, use many types of brushstrokes, and many textures of paint. The surface of the painting may have flat colour, lines, squiggles and dabs of paint. In a pointillist painting, every part of the picture is done in tiny dots, and most of the dots are about the same size. Pointillism is usually done in oil paints, because they are thick and do not run into each other when they are painted on the canvas.\nPrinting and television.\nMany colour printers and large printing presses use four colours to print in tiny dots of cyan (blue), magenta (red), yellow, and black. Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to show many different colors using only red, green, and blue.\nMusic.\nThe name Pointillism is also given to a style of 20th-century music. Different musical notes are made separately from each other, giving a sound texture similar to pointillism. This type of music is also known as \"punctualism\" or \"klangfarbenmelodie\"."}

He was born in San Mateo, California, and studied botany, medicine and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. He served in the United States Air Force during World War II before being injured in a plane crash. He was in the hospital for several years, and it was while he was there that he began to paint. Once he was out of the hospital he returned to Berkeley, this time to study art.\nFrancis was initially influenced by the work of abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko, Arshile Gorky and Clyfford Still. He spent the 1950s in Paris, having his first exhibition there in 1952. While there he became associated with Tachisme. He later spent time in Japan, and some have seen an influence from Zen Buddhism in Francis\u2019 work.\nFrancis spent some time in Paris making entirely monochromatic works, but his mature pieces are generally large oil paintings with splashed or splattered areas of bright contrasting colour. Areas of white canvas are often left to show through, and in later works, paint is sometimes confined to the edges of the canvas.\nFrancis returned to California during the 1960s and continued painting in Los Angeles. During the final three decades of his career his style of large scale bright Abstract Expressionism was also closely associated with Color Field painting. During the last year of his life, suffering from prostate cancer and unable to paint with his right hand after a fall, in a final burst of energy he used his left hand to complete a dazzling series of about 150 small paintings before he died. He was buried in Olema, in Marin County, California.\nAfter the death of the artist, the Samuel L. Francis Foundation, Inc. (also known as the \"Samuel L. Francis Art Museum, Inc.\" or the \"Sam Francis Foundation\") was founded. The Foundation not only serves as his official Estate, but also has a mission \"to research, document, protect and perpetuate the creative legacy of [Francis].\" The U.S. copyright representative for the Francis Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.\nAs of 2008, the Foundation is working to create a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of Francis's work. In addition to collecting information on known Francis works, they also have a page dedicated to \"missing works\" for which they are seeking any information interested parties may have.\nIn 2010, artist and filmmaker Jeffrey Perkins released the documentary \"The Painter Sam Francis\". The documentary includes film of Francis at work, filmed between 1968 and the early '90s together with interviews with friends, family, and professional associates of Francis."}

Rock with more than 50% tuff is called \"tuffaceous\". The chemical and mineral composition of tuff varies according to what was in the molten magma.\nVolcanic ash.\nIn a volcanic eruption, Magma is blown apart by volcanic gases and steam. The products are volcanic gases, lava, steam, and tephra (fragments). The solid material produced and thrown into the air is called \"tephra\", regardless of composition or fragment size. If the pieces of ejecta are small, the material is called volcanic ash, defined as such particles less than 2\u00a0mm in diameter, sand-sized or smaller. These particles are small, slaggy pieces of magma and rock that have been tossed into the air by outbursts of steam and other gases.\nStructure.\nBreccias.\nAmong the loose beds of ash that cover the slopes of many volcanoes, three classes of materials are represented. \nIn some great volcanic explosions nothing but materials of the second kind were emitted, as at Mount Bandai in Japan in 1888. There have also been many eruptions in which the quantity of broken sedimentary rocks that mingled with the ash is very great. \nThese materials, in contrast to true ashes, tend to occur in \"angular fragments\". When they form a large part of the mass the rock is more properly a 'volcanic breccia' than a tuff. A breccia is a rock with sharp-edged fragments in it.\nAgglomerate.\nThe ashes vary in size from large blocks twenty feet or more in diameter to the minutest impalpable dust. The large masses are called 'volcanic bombs'; they have mostly a rounded, elliptical or pear-shaped form owing to rotation in the air before they solidified. Many of them have ribbed or nodular surfaces, and sometimes they have a crust intersected by many cracks like the surface of a loaf of bread. Any ash in which they are very abundant is called an agglomerate.\nConsolidation.\nA tuff of recent origin is generally loose, but the older tuffs have usually been cemented together by pressure and the action of infiltrating water. This makes rocks which, while not very hard, are strong enough to be used for building purposes (e.g. in the neighborhood of Rome). \nUnder water.\nMany volcanoes stand near the sea, and the ashes cast out by them are mingled with the sediments that are gathering at the bottom of the waters. In this way ashy muds or sands or even in some cases ashy limestones are formed. As a matter of fact most of the tuffs found in the older rock formations contain mixtures of clay, sand, and sometimes fossil shells, which prove that they were beds spread out under water.\nRepeated eruptions.\nDuring some volcanic eruptions a layer of ashes several feet in thickness is deposited over a considerable district, but such beds thin out rapidly as the distance from the crater increases, and ash deposits covering many square miles are usually very thin. \nThe showers of ashes often follow one another after longer or shorter intervals, and hence thick masses of tuff, whether of subaerial or of marine origin, have mostly a stratified character. In the fine beds it is often developed in great perfection.\nWelded tuff.\nWelded tuff is a pyroclastic flow of lava which was hot enough to weld together. During welding, the glass shards and pumice fragments adhere together (necking at point contacts), deform, and compact together. \nA hot lava flow welded by heat can be highly voluminous, such as the Lava Creek Tuff erupted from Yellowstone Caldera in Wyoming 640,000 years ago. Lava Creek Tuff was at least 1000 times as large as the deposits of the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. It had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 8\u2014greater than any eruption known in the last 10,000 years.\nBasaltic tuffs.\nBasaltic tuffs are occur widely. They are found in Skye, Mull, Antrim and other places, where there are tertiary volcanic rocks; in Scotland, Derbyshire and Ireland among the carboniferous strata; and among the still older rocks of the Lake District, southern uplands of Scotland and Wales. \nBasaltic tuffs are black, dark green or red in colour. They vary greatly in coarseness. Often submarine, they may contain shale, sandstone, grit and other sedimentary material, and are occasionally fossiliferous. Recent basaltic tuffs are found in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Jan Mayen, Sicily, Sandwich Islands, Samoa, etc. "}

The next day, Dovepaw makes a big blunder (mistake) and lets slip how she knew about the patrol being attacked. Firestar discovers then that they are the Three.\nAfter the Tigerheart on ThunderClan territory incident, Lionblaze soon must help with the falling tree. He helps to rebuild the camp with the materials that are now available with the tree having fallen.\nAt this point, the stories combine.\nIvypaw's story.\nIvypaw's story begins when she starts having dreams. She is unknowingly being trained to be in the Dark Forest's army, and she gets stronger and quicker. She has an argument with Dovepaw, and their bond starts to weaken. Much later, she has a \"sign\" that ShadowClan is going to take the territory up to Jayfeather's herbs, and then the stories all combine.\nCombined story.\nIvypaw, Dovepaw, and Lionblaze all join into the major fight that happens as a result of Ivypaw, and the tree climbing techniques come in handy for the battle. ThunderClan wins the fight, but each Clan loses a life. Firestar loses his semifinal (second to last) life. Russetfur dies."}

It is a statement which has a truth value, meaning it can be proved to be true or false. For a proposition to be valid, it must be possible to prove the proposition is either true or false. Many teachers and students of logic use the term \"statement\" and \"proposition\" to mean the same thing. Propositions are also often represented by capital letters such as formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3. \nIt is possible to express the same proposition in many way. Proposition are only concerned with actual meaning, not the way the proposition is expressed. Propositions can look different, yet still mean the same thing. When two different propositions mean the same thing, they are said to be synonymous, meaning each statement has the same meaning. \nFor example, \"Snow is white\" (in English) and \"Schnee ist wei\u00df\" (in German) are different sentences, because they are written in different languages. However, they mean exactly the same thing: snow is white. No matter what language the statement is written in, it will mean the same thing. As a result, these statements are synonymous. \nIn Aristotelian logic, a proposition is a specific kind of sentence that confirms or denies an action or predicate took place through a subject. Aristotelian propositions take forms like \"All men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\". In each sentence, the subject (men, Socrates) has a status (are mortal, is a man) which can be regarded as true or false.\nIn logical positivism, a proposition whose truth value cannot possibly be decided is meaningless (Quine, for instance, believes that propositions generally have no clear criterion of identity). For example, statements about the existence of deities cannot be proved under logical positivism. Because the statements have no truth value, a logical positivist would consider propositions about deities (such as \"God exists\" or \"God does not exist\") to have no logical meaning."}

If it is very extensive, karst can be a geographical or topographical feature. It is classed as a badland if it difficult to travel through the environment, which it often is.\nAlmost always, karst is formed in carbonate rocks, such as limestone or dolomite. Since carbonate sedimentary rocks are very common, karst areas occur all over the world.\nMany karst regions display distinctive surface features, with sinkholes being the most common. However, karst surface features may be absent where the soluble rock is \"mantled\" (covered), such as by a non-soluble rock strata on top of the carbonate strata. Some karst regions include thousands of caves, and the water is generally underground.\nThe world's largest karst area is the Nullarbor Plain, part of the area of flat, almost treeless, dry country of southern Australia. It is on the Great Australian Bight coast with the Great Victoria Desert to its north. It is the world's largest single exposure of limestone bedrock, and occupies an area of about . At its widest point, it stretches about from east to west across the border region between South Australia and Western Australia.\nSinkholes.\nMany parts of the world suffer from sinkholes which form when karsts are underground. Beneath the flat surface of the land in Florida, Guatemala City and elsewhere are vast systems of limestone. Water running through the limestone is dissolving the limestone away, leaving huge caverns. Without warning, huge holes appear in the surface, causing great damage. Practically the whole of Florida is sitting on a gigantic karst system, as are several countries in Central America. The area round Tampa is especially at risk, and there is a huge karst system under Mexico City. According to a senior geochemist, there are as many as 15,000 sinkholes in Illinois.\nThe world's deepest sinkhole is China's Xiaozhai Tienkeng at 2172ft (662m). \nThe Qattara Depression in Egypt is part of the Libyan Desert. It is roughly 50 miles (80km) by 75 miles (121km) in surface area. It is the world's largest natural sinkhole. It lies below sea level and is covered with salt pans, sand dunes and salt marshes."}

Some publishers, though, do not show their articles for some time after they publish them on paper (usually about six months).\nHistory.\nPubMed Central was started in 2000. At first, it only had papers from \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\" and \"Molecular Biology of the Cell\". People can add older papers to PubMed Central. The oldest papers in PubMed Central are from the 1700s.\nAs of September 2004, PubMedCentral, PubMed, and related NLM services had about 1,300 hits every second, and gave 1.3 terabytes of data every day. The Library of Congress and the British Library showed support for the National Library of Medicine (NLM). It has also been popular with journal service providers.\nPubMed Central and PubMed.\nPubMed Central is different from PubMed. The regular PubMed has papers' titles and abstracts, and PubMed central has the whole paper. Scientists call this \"full text.\"\nPMCID.\nThe PubMed Central Identifier (PMCID) is an ID tag for papers written by scientists and doctors. It is like an ISBN is for books. It shows the reader where to find the paper in the PubMed Central database."}

It is any loose rock that is larger than 2 mm (0.079 in) in its smallest dimension (about 1/12 of an inch) and no more than 64 mm (2.5 in).\nSmall gravel is composed of granules (&gt;2 to 4 mm/0.079 to 0.16 in). Large gravel is called pebbles (&gt;4 to 64 mm/0.16 to 2.5 in). \nParticles smaller than gravel are sand, larger particles are cobbles.\nGravel and sand are used for road surfaces, and for cement and Tarmac. Mixtures of gravel and sand mixed with various crushed material, are known as \"aggregate\" in the trade. This is used for drainage in the basement of roads, and other purposes. Mixture of stones and resin is also used to pave footpaths, driveways, etc. This mixture is known as Resin Bonded Gravel.\nOrigin.\nNatural gravel comes from ancient beaches which have not consolidated (turned into solid rock). In effect, beaches from (for instance) the Jurassic are dug up in quarries. The material is then sifted into size categories. The gravel and sand is then sold on to engineering companies. Most natural sand and gravel is silica, SiO2, in its chemistry. This is very hard-wearing.\nHowever, if the material is originally in hard rock form, then it is first crushed. This enables the industry to offer other materials such as granite or limestone, originally solid rock, as gravel.\nThe open-cast mining and processing of gravel, sand and aggregate is a huge world-wide industry, sometimes called \"conglomerates\"."}

One of the biggest spice routes was a route between Asia and Europe. \nOnly a few spices grew in Europe, so the others had to be brought from Asia. People made a route to go from Europe to Asia to buy spices. The route was very difficult and so the spices were expensive. People tried to find ways cheaper than the spice route, including going the other way around the world. This made the Age of Discovery, when they found places that they didn't know about, such as the Western Hemisphere.\nCountries traded spices for gold and other things. They did this so they could get new spices or gain money and gold by selling their own. Sometimes people traded the spices because their country is running out of that certain spice."}

{"id": "273469", "revid": "7634467", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273469", "title": "Meson", "text": "Mesons are incredibly small subatomic particles that are made of one quark and one antiquark. Antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark. Since antimatter quarks have the opposite spin of regular quarks, their spins can cancel each other out, which forms a particle similar to a Higgs Boson. The name meson comes from Greek \"mesos\", meaning middle. This is because the masses of the first mesons discovered were between the mass of light particles like electrons, called leptons, and heavy particles like protons, called baryons.\nMesons' spin.\nMesons are hadrons, which simply means that they are made of quarks. Since quarks have different fractional charges, mesons can have a charge. However, the charges of the quarks may cancel out, forming an uncharged meson. The rest of the hadron family are known as baryons, which are made of three quarks. Since quarks all have a spin of 1/2, three of them will never add up to an integer spin. An integer spin is simply 0, 1, or 2. Particles with an integer spin are called bosons, which obey Bose-Einstein Statistics. This means that more than one boson can actually be in the same point in space at the same time. However, a meson is made of one quark and one antiquark, which each do not have an integer spin. Particles which do not have an integer spin have a spin of 1/2 or 3/2. These particles with 1/2 spin are called Fermions because they obey Fermi-Dirac Statistics. This means that no more than one fermion can be in the same point in space at the same time. All known baryons and quarks (and antiquarks) are fermions, and all mesons are bosons. This can get very confusing because this means that more than one meson can exist in the same point in space at the same time, but the quarks that make up mesons cannot exist in the same point in space at the same time.\nCreation of Mesons.\nThe most common natural way that we find mesons are through the interactions of cosmic rays with matter. This process can be duplicated in particle accelerators, which smash high-energy quarks and antiquarks. However, the mesons are very unstable and quickly turn into other particles. Charged Mesons can decay into electrons and neutrinos, and uncharged mesons can decay into photons. Since antimatter is destroying matter, a large amount of energy is given off. The energy follows the equation E=mc2."}

There are four orders.\nOccurrence.\nThe belemnites evolved from nautiloids, which are the basal group of cephalopods. Well-formed belemnite guards can be found in rocks dating from the Mississippian (or Lower Carboniferous).\nBelemnites were numerous during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and their fossils are abundant in Mesozoic marine rocks, often with their cousins the ammonites. The belemnites and ammonites become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period.\nLife-style.\nLike some modern squid, belemnite arms carried a series of small hooks for grabbing prey. Belemnites were efficient carnivores that caught small fish and other marine animals with their arms and ate them with their beak-like jaws.\nIn turn, belemnites appear to have formed part of the diet of marine reptiles such as Ichthyosaurs, whose fossilized stomachs frequently contain hooks from the arms of cephalopods.\nBelemnites swam in near-shore to mid-shelf oceans.\nAncient ink.\nFossils which preserve the soft parts of belemnites show that, like many modern cephalopods, they had an ink sac, hard beaks, tail fins and large eyes. Well-preserved specimens show evidence of muscular fibers in the mantle, indicating that they were powerful swimmers like modern squids.\nIn 1826 Mary Anning discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revive the ink with water, and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Other local artists were soon doing the same when more fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern squid and cuttle fish, which she had dissected to better understand the anatomy of fossil cephalopods. This led William Buckland to publish that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do."}

Many interesting events have been often held at Cheonggyecheon as well.\nHistory.\nIt was originally called 'Gaecheon(Hangul:\uac1c\ucc9c, Hanja:\u958b\u5ddd ).' The Cheonggyecheon used to be a naturally formed stream before the Joseon Dynasty designated Seoul as its capital. This stream caused a flood and inundated private houses in full spate. In ordinary times, it was unsanitary because of standing sewage therein. Therefore, King Taejong, the third king of the Joseon Dynasty, firstly beginned river training work by starting construction work for an open channel. After that, King Yeongjo, the 21st king of the Joseon Dynasty, conducted the overhaul of the stream in earnest by dredging the stream, building stone banks and changing a waterway. Due to this construction, the curved waterway of the stream became straight one at last. During the reign of King Sunjo and King Kojong, the overhaul of the stream was continued. There were 24 bridges over the stream(now 22 bridges).\nDuring the Japanese colonial period, it came to get called \"Cheonggye\" as it is called today, supposedly from 1914, when the colonialists rearranged stream names in Korea. In this perion, the large-scale dredging of this stream was planned in terms of a modern urban planning by Japan but it wasn't carried out because of lack of funds. Therefore, the urban improvement project was neglected.\nAs a result, by Korea\u2019s independence from Japan in 1945, the Cheonggyecheon was severely contaminated with wastes from flimsy shacks built alongside of the stream. It had a fetid smell as well. In terms of Seoul's appearance and sanitation, the then Cheonggyecheon was a serious problem. The easiest way of solving this promblem was covering over the stream with concrete. In 1958, finally, the work to cover it up with concrete started as quickly as possible by August 1958. In addition, a 5.6\u00a0km-long, 16 m-wide elevated highway was completed over the stream in August 1971 after four working years.\nAbout 40 years after covering over the stream with concrete, Seoul city had resuscitated the stream since July 2003. After $386 milion recovery project, Cheonggyecheon was born again as a haven for wildlife as well as pedestrians in September 2005"}

The family was originally created in 1988 to contain the genera \"Halomonas\" and \"Deleya\". Many of its members were only recently discovered, and research is discovering new facts about them.\nGFAG-1.\nGFAJ-1 is a strain of rod-shaped extremophile bacteria in the Halomonadaceae. It was claimed that, when it did not have phosphorus, it took the usually poisonous element arsenic as a substitute. \nGeomicrobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon collected lake-bottom sediments in the shallow waters of Mono Lake in California. Wolfe-Simon cultured the organisms from this hypersaline (very salty) and highly alkaline environment. They grew in an arsenic-containing medium.\nUnfortunately, the conclusions taken from this research have been disproved. A group of researchers analyzed the DNA of GFAJ-1, and could not detect any arsenic. The phosphorus in its DNA cannot be, and is not, replaced with arsenic.\nBackground.\nLife is mostly composed of the elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Although these six elements make up nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids and thus the bulk of living matter, it is possible in theory that some other elements in the periodic table might serve the same functions.\nIt is believed that all life needs phosphorus as a basic piece of the \u2018backbone\u2019 that holds DNA together.

Sewage flows in sewer pipes from houses and factories. When it arrives at a sewage treatment plant it passes through many stages. Larger treatment plants often have more stages than smaller ones. \nLarge objects and rags are removed using screens. The sewage then flows through a tank so sand and grit can fall out. This protects the machines in later stages. \nFats and solids are removed in the first treatment stage. Sewage enters a tank where solids fall to the bottom and fat floats to the top. Fats and solids stay in the tank and the water continues to the next stage. This is called primary treatment.\nModern sewage treatment started in London about 1850. The first treatment plants for sewage were designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette.\nImportance of oxygen.\nBacteria and amoebae in the gut and bowels are totally anaerobic. Oxygen kills them. A key aspect of the treatment is not just to remove solids, but to \"run the sewage through oxygenated water\". It is this which is the most important part of treatment after solids are removed. The use of chemicals is only done exceptionally. Dumping sewage into the sea is disgusting, but has been done at times when the treatment plants are not adequate.\nSmall treatment plants may use a small pond, called a lagoon, to hold the sewage while oxygen destroys the bacteria. Larger treatment plants use machines to help process the sewage. Some treatment works have rocks or pieces of plastic for the bacteria to grow on. Water is pumped over the rocks or plastic.\nSolids from the first and second treatment tanks can be used to make methane gas and fertilizer for farmers fields or may be dried and sent to a landfill."}

It is the largest national park in Wales and includes the highest mountain in Wales, and the largest natural lake in Wales. Before 1951, the word \"Snowdonia\" was used for the much smaller area around Snowdon itself. The which includes the national park is twice as large.\nName.\nThe English name for the area comes from Snowdon, which is the highest mountain in Wales, at 3,560 feet above sea level. In Welsh it is named \"Eryri.\" This could be the Welsh word for eagle, which is\" eryr\", or it may mean \"highlands\". In the Middle Ages, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who was the Prince of Wales, was called \"Prince of Wales and Lord of Snowdonia\". In Welsh, it translates to \"Tywysog Cymru ac Arglwydd Eryri\". Gruffudd's grandfather, Llywelyn Fawr, was called \"Prince of north Wales and Lord of Snowdonia.\"\nBefore it was a national park, the name \"Snowdonia\" was used to describe \"Snowdon,\" a small area north of Gwynedd. Today, the national park covers an area that is two times larger than the area originally called Snowdonia. The park covers areas as far south as Meirionnydd. The original Snowdonia includes Snowdon, and three other mountain ranges: the Glyderau, the Carneddau and the Moel Siabod group. The hills that are south of Maentwrog are not part of the original Snowdonia.\nSnowdonia National Park.\nSnowdonia National Park () was started in 1951. It was the third national park in Britain. It makes up , and has of coastline in its border. The park is ran by the Snowdonia National Park Authority. The park has lands that are owned by private people and also by the public. \nSnowdonia has many historic sites, including Stone Age burial chambers, Iron age hill forts, Roman forts, churches, and medieval castles. There are also industrial sites including large slate quarries, copper mines, and woolen mills. More than 26,000 people live in Snowdonia. The area attracts over six million visitors every year. Most of the land is either open or mountainous land, but there is also some farm-land. Snowdonia National Park does not include the town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, which is like an island in the centre of the park.\nMountain ranges.\nSnowdonia may be divided into four areas:\nHiking.\nPeople can hike the area, primarily in Snowdon. People can hike the Snowdon Mountain Railway all the way to the top of the mountain. People also hike other mountains in the area such as Tryfan and lower areas that aren't very mountainous. There are of footpaths that go through the park. bridleways are also in the area for people to ride horses. The park also has many areas that are within Right to Roam laws.\nNature and environment.\nThe coastline in the park is a Special Area of Conservation. The area starts at Ll\u0177n Peninsula and goes down the coast. There are sand dunes located in the special area. The park has trees. They are a mix of different types of deciduous trees. The tree seen the most in the park is the Welsh Oak. Birch, ash, mountain-ash and hazel trees are also found in the park. There are coniferous forests that have been planted by people. These forests include Gwydir Forest. These forests used to be harvested for wood. Now they grow without people cutting down the trees. \nThe park is the only place in Britain where Snowdon lily and the Snowdon beetle can be found. It is the only place in the world where the Snowdonia hawkweed is found. An invasive species is growing in the park, too, called the \"Rhododendron ponticum\". It kills native species that live in the park and also makes fungus grow that is poisonous. The fungus stays alive up to seven years after the rhododendron is killed.\nAnimals.\nAlmost 20% of the land in Snowdonia is protected under laws. These laws protect the plants and animals that live in Snowdonia. Half of the 20% of protected land is part of the national park. Otters, polecats, and wild goats live in Snowdonia. So do pine marten's but they are very hard to find and are rare. Other birds that are rare and hard to find are ravens, peregrine, osprey, merlin, and red kites. The Snowdown beetle, which is rainbow colored, also lives in Snowdon.\nWeather.\nSnowdonia is one of the wettest parts of the United Kingdom. The area Crib Goch, which is in Snowdonia, is the wettest place in the UK. It rains, on average, a year."}

It uses Jeju World Cup Stadium as its home stadium. Although it is based in Jeju at this moment, it has been through several base changes. Its original name was Yukong Elephants FC, which was founded in 1982 and based in Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi-do province. This YooGong football club changed its home stadium to Seoul in 1990. In 1996, as a part of localization policy, it again changed its home stadium to Bucheon, and changed its name as Bucheon SK. However, the overall facilities in Bucheon were not enough, so it finally changed its home stadium to Jeju Island, thus getting the name 'Jeju United FC.'\nOverview.\nThis football club is famous for educating coaches and for supporting the development of football techniques. For example, Valeri Nepomniachi, the Russian coach hired in 1994, delivered many developed strategies and techniques to the K-League. This created a vogue 'Nepomniachi Style' among other teams. Its mascot is Kamguri, which represents the symbol of Jeju, the Mandarin. Its home stadium, 'Jeju World Cup Stadium,' can accommodate 35,545 people.\nJeju United FC has been doing well in the K-league. It came in 3rd in the 1983 Superleague. Beginning from this, it has usually maintained good rankings in K-league including the championship in 1989. In this year (2010), it maintained first place throughout the season, but was surpassed by FC Seoul at the last match, ending in the second. \nEmblem.\nThe emblem of Jeju United FC is a shield-shaped one with the combination of black, red, and blue. This will enable people to feel the power of the football team. To be more specific, the emblem represents Hallasan and the horn of a deer which symbolize Jeju Island. This expresses the defense power of the team. At the same time, the sword in the middle which was made from the 'J' in Jeju Island involves the team's spirit that it will adopt the attacking-strategy as its main one. In addition to this, it uses the motif of SK group's Happy Wings so that the Jeju residents would become united through the soccer.\nStadium.\nJeju World Cup Stadium was built in harmony with Jeju's culture, nature, and life. First, the entrance was made after the traditional entrance, Olle. Also, Jeongnang, a traditional door, stands next to the entrance. The overall shape of the stadium resembles the so-called 'Oreum'. Oreum is a parasitic volcano, and its top has a concave shape. To attain this concave shape, the stadium made the field 14m under the ground, which minimized the effect of the wind. Besides, the roof of the stadium symbolizes Teu, the traditional boat for fishing. As a home stadium of Jeju United FC, it can accommodate more than 35.000 people."}

Because his mother rejected him when he was born, he was raised by zookeepers. People began to protest for him after a German newspaper called \"Bild-Zeitung\" quoted an animal rights activist saying the young cub had to die. Both children and adults supported him, and e-mails and letters asking the zoo to let the cub live were sent from around the world. Because of his fame, Knut became a tourist attraction and commercial success.\nKnut became very popular and the center of mass media attention called \"Knutmania\". Many toys, DVDs, and books were made about him. This brought in lots of money, about five million euros, to Berlin Zoo in 2007. More people went to the zoo, and that year was the most profitable year in the zoo's 163-year history.\nPolar bear Knut died on 19 March 2011, because of the brain disease encephalitis.\nBiography.\nInfancy.\nKnut was born at Berlin Zoo. His mother was Tosca, a 20-year-old polar bear. She was a circus performer from East Germany, born in Canada, and her 13-year-old mate, Lars, was from a park in Munich. Tosca gave birth to Knut and his unnamed brother on 5 December 2006. However, she left her cubs on a rock in the polar bear enclosure and did not take care of them. The zookeepers rescued the cubs with a fishing net, but Knut's brother died from sickness four days later. Knut was only the size of a guinea pig, and had to spend the first 44 days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas D\u00f6rflein began raising the cub.\nD\u00f6rflein had to sleep on a mattress next to the cub at night because Knut needed care. D\u00f6rflein also had to play with, bathe, and feed the cub every day. Knut's food began with a bottle of baby milk mixed with cod liver oil every two hours. At four months old, he could eat milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins. D\u00f6rflein also appeared with Knut on the twice-daily one-hour shows at the zoo. Because of this, he appeared in lots of videos and photographs with the cub, and became well known in Germany. He also won Berlin's Medal of Merit in honor of his hard work and care for Knut. D\u00f6rflein died of a heart attack on 22 September 2008.\nControversy.\nIn early March 2007, the German newspaper \"Bild-Zeitung\" quoted the animal rights activist Frank Albrecht, who said that Knut should be killed instead of humiliated by being raised in a zoo. He declared that the zoo was breaking the rules of animal protection by keeping him alive. Wolfram Graf-Rudolf, the director of the Aachen Zoo, agreed with Albrecht. He stated that the zookeepers \"should have had the courage to let the bear die\". A group of children protested at the zoo, holding up signs that read \"Knut Must Live\" and \"We Love Knut\". Others sent emails and letters asking for the cub's life to be spared. Threatening letters were also sent to Albrecht. Berlin Zoo agreed to support the baby polar bear, and promised not to harm him.\nAlbrecht later claimed that he had quoted this because he wanted to change the law, not to have the bear killed. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.\nFame.\nOn 23 March 2007, Knut appeared in public for the first time. About 400 journalists visited Berlin Zoo on what was called \"Knut Day\" to make reports all over the world. Because Knut became famous when he was very young, many wrong stories about the cub's health were spread around during his first year. For example, on 16 April 2007, Knut took a break from his display because of teething pains, but reports said that he might have an unknown sickness. There were also many death threats, like the one sent on Wednesday 18 April 2007. The zoo received an anonymous letter by fax which said \"Knut ist tot! Donnerstag Mittag.\" (\"Knut is dead! Thursday noon.\") The police increased the bear's security.\nIn November 2007, Knut weighed over 90\u00a0kg (198\u00a0lb) and became too dangerous to be cared for closely. Hundreds of children attended the cub's first birthday celebration. This party was also shown live on German television. The national mint also made 25,000 special silver coins for his birthday. When Flocke, a female polar bear, was born at the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2007, \"Bild\" named her Mrs. Knut, suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates.\n2008\u20132010.\nA year after his public debut, Knut was reported as weighing more than 130\u00a0kg (286\u00a0lb). Very strong six-inch glass was put up between him and the zoo visitors. At the end of March 2008, Markus R\u00f6bke, one of the zookeepers who helped raise Knut, said the bear should leave the zoo to help him get used to living alone. R\u00f6bke also said that Knut misses Thomas D\u00f6rflein, who was like a father to him, and that he cries when no one is near him. \"Knut needs an audience,\" R\u00f6bke said. \"That has to change\".\nIn July 2008, it was announced that the Neum\u00fcnster Zoo in northern Germany, which owns Knut's father, sued Berlin Zoo for the money that came from Knut's success. Neum\u00fcnster had tried to be friendly with Berlin Zoo at first, but now was trying to use the court to make them give part of the money that came from Knut. Peter Dr\u00fcwa, the zoo director at Neum\u00fcnster, said that they \"do not want to remove Knut from his environment, but we have a right to our request for money.\" Shortly before Knut's second birthday, there were reports being spread that the bear would have to move to another zoo because he was getting too large for his enclosure. However, the zoo said that they still wanted to keep Knut.\n between the two zoos continued into 2009. On 19 May, Berlin Zoo offered to \"buy\" Knut from Neum\u00fcnster and take their financial claim on the two-year-old polar bear. Although Neum\u00fcnster Zoo set a price of \u20ac700,000, Berlin Zoo stated that they would not pay \"a cent more\" than \u20ac350,000 ($488,145). On 8 July, the Berlin Zoo agreed to pay \u20ac430,000 ($599,721) to keep Knut in Berlin.\nGiovanna, a female polar bear about the same age as Knut, went to Berlin from Munich's Hellabrunn Animal Garden in September 2009. She shared Knut's enclosure for a short time while her regular home had repairs. Her arrival interested people from all over the world, because many sources thought the two bears (although they were sexually immature) would soon be \"dating\". However, in March 2010, the German chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) called for Giovanna to stay somewhere else. Knut and Giovanna share a grandfather, and PETA spokesperson Frank Albrecht thought the same person who had claimed that Knut should be killed would threaten the German polar bear population if they might breed. The Berlin Zoo did not respond, but noted that Giovanna's stay in Berlin was only for a short time. In August 2010, Giovanna was moved back to Munich after repairs to her enclosure were finished.\nKnut's death.\nKnut died on 19 March 2011 because of a brain disease. He had encephalitis (irritation and swelling of the brain). The swelling was probably caused by a virus, and caused an epileptic fit. After death, the body of the bear was a subject of further study at the Berlin Museum of Natural History.\nEffects of popularity.\nCommercial success.\nBerlin Zoo made Knut a trademark in late March 2007. As a result, its shares became even higher. Knut earned Berlin Zoo nearly \u20ac5 million that year.\nMany companies made cuddly toys modeled from Knut. Steiff, a toy company, made Knut-based stuffed animals in three sizes and models: sitting, standing, and lying down. They all sold out at the Berlin Zoo in only four days. The money was used to improve the bear's home. Candy company Haribo sold a raspberry-flavored gummy bear sweet called Cuddly Knut beginning in April 2007. They promised to give ten cents to the zoo for every package of Knut sweets it sold. The gummy bears sold very quickly as well.\nKnut has been the subject of several popular songs in Germany, such as the singles \"Knut is Cute\" and \"Knut, der kleine Eisb\u00e4r\" () by nine-year-old Kitty. In Britain, musical comedian Mitch Benn has performed three songs about Knut for BBC Radio 4 satirical series \"The Now Show\": \"The Baby Bear Must DIE!\", \"Knut Isn't Cute Anymore\", and \"Goodbye Knut\"\u2014\"Goodbye Knut\" was about Knut moving to the Neum\u00fcnster Zoo. Knut has also been in several DVDs, including one titled \"Knut\u2014Stories from a Polar Bear's Nursery\". He appeared on the 29 March 2007 cover of the German \"Vanity Fair\" magazine, which was about the bear's life.\nOn 1 May 2007 it was announced that New York-based Turtle Pond Publications and Berlin Zoo had signed a deal for the worldwide publishing rights to Knut with the hopes of raising global warming issues. Written by Craig Hatkoff and his daughters, the 44-page book entitled \"Knut, der kleine Eisb\u00e4renjunge\" (\"Little Polar Bear Knut\") is about Knut's life story as well as photographs. Although books about Knut had already been published in Germany, this book was the first to be authorized by the Berlin Zoo.\nThe book was published in Germany by Ravensburger on 26 July 2007. After that, the US publishing company Scholastic made an English version, \"Knut: How one little polar bear captivated the world\".\nOn 31 December 2007, the zoo's director said that the zoo had received a proposal for a movie deal from Hollywood movie producer Ash R. Shah, to make an animated movie about the bear's life. Shah reportedly suggested a \u20ac3.5 million movie deal to the zoo. The German movie \"Knut und seine Freunde\" (\"Knut and His Friends\"), was shown in Berlin on 2 March 2008. Directed by Michael Johnson, the movie was about how Knut was rescued after his mother did not take care of him.\nEnvironmental causes.\nDr. Gerald Uhlich, of Berlin zoo, stated that Knut \"draw[s] attention to the environment in a nice way.\" As a result, the German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference about endangered species. Gabriel met with Knut soon after his zoo debut, and said that although Knut was safe, \"worldwide polar bears are in danger and if Knut can help the cause, then that is a good thing.\"\nPhotographer Annie Leibovitz took pictures of Knut that were used for an environmental campaign. The polar bear has also been on the logo for the German Environment Minister's campaign to help stop global warming and a 2008 stamp. The stamp shows the roughly one-year-old Knut with the slogan \"Natur weltweit bewahren\" (\"Preserve nature worldwide\")."}

Toll roads are there in part to control the number of people using it. They may be built to allow some users to travel faster and avoid traffic congestion, speeding up traffic. In the past, tolls were collected to give income to governments or landowners. Today, tolls can be considered a form of tax which pays for the cost of road construction and maintenance that are not charged on those who do not use that road.\nHow toll roads work.\nThere are many types of toll roads. Tolls might be charged to use a bridge, tunnel, or highway. On some roads, the amount of money you pay depends on how far along the road you go, and/or whether you are driving a car, motorcycle, bus, or truck. On other roads, you pay the same amount no matter how far you go or what you drive.\nThere are also many ways tolls can be collected. In the first toll roads, you had to stop at a booth along the road and pay the toll to a person, called a \"collector\". Depending on the road, you might have to do so when you get on, when you get off, or both. Because many vehicles may be waiting to pay the toll, the area around \"toll plazas\", which are a bunch of booths blocking the whole road, can be crowded. Recently, there are roads that have \"electronic toll collection\", which makes use of computer chips and RFID technology to identify drivers and charge their tolls on their bank accounts.\nTolls might be collected by vehicles traveling on one or more lanes of a road which is otherwise free to use. These lanes are often called \"high occupancy toll lanes\" because in most cases, vehicles with more than one person do not have to pay to use the lane. These lanes are there to encourage carpooling. If there are fewer cars on the road, more people can get to where they want to go without getting stuck in traffic.\nAll roads have to be paid for somehow, and so are never truly \"free\". Normally, road construction costs are paid for by the taxes on gasoline, diesel, or other fuel. Users of toll roads still pay these taxes \"and\" the tolls for using this particular road or lane.\nHistory.\nMythology.\nTolls are mentioned in Greek mythology where Charon the ferryman charged a toll to carry the dead across the rivers Acheron and Styx to Hades. If the soul paid a toll, Charon ferried it across the river. If not, it wandered between death and life for eternity.\nAncient times.\nToll roads are at least 2700 years old, as tolls had to be paid by travellers using the Susa\u2013Babylon highway under the regime of Ashurbanipal, in the seventh century BC.\nAristotle and Pliny refer to tolls in Arabia and other parts of Asia. In India, before the 4th century BC, the Arthasastra notes the use of tolls. Germanic tribes charged tolls to travellers across mountain passes.\nEconomics.\nInvestor's bonds may be sold to those who are paying for the road to be built, and it is expected that they will be paid back over time by charging tolls. Once the bonds are paid off, the road is usually given back to the government agency that owns the land it was built on and had allowed the road to be built.\nUnited Kingdom turnpikes.\nThe need to build better roads than the existing ones was a reason for turnpikes. Turnpike trusts were established in England and Wales from about 1706. Turnpike trusts were set up by individual Acts of Parliament, with powers to collect road tolls Britain. At the peak, in the 1830s, over 1,000 trusts had about of turnpike road in England and Wales. They had almost 8,000 toll-gates. The trusts were responsible for keeping and improving most main roads in England and Wales. This helped distribute agriculture and industrial goods and kept prices low. The Turnpike trusts were gradually abolished starting in the 1870s. Most trusts improved existing roads, but some new ones, usually only short stretches of road, were also built. Thomas Telford's Holyhead road (now the A5 road) is exceptional: it was a long new road, built in the early 19th century with many toll booths along its length."}

Halophiles live in evaporation ponds or salt lakes such as Great Salt Lake, Owens Lake, or Dead Sea. The name \"halophile\" comes from Greek for \"salt-loving\". \nMost halophiles are archaeans, but some bacteria and eukaryotes are also halophiles, such as the alga \"Dunaliella salina\". \nLifestyle.\nMost halophilic and salt-eating animals use energy to remove salt from their cytoplasm. Normally, organisms living around a lot of salt would lose water and die because of osmosis. Water inside the organism would move from inside the cell to its outside environment. This is because there is always movement of water to reach a state where the concentrations of salt are the same on both sides of the cell membrane.\nTo survive, the cytoplasm of halophiles must be isotonic with its environment. \nTo get to this state, halophiles use two different methods. In the first (mainly used by bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are stored in the cytoplasm. These compounds help the organism survive the stress of osmosis. The most commonly used solutes for this process are neutral and include amino acids and sugars. Advantages to this method are that organisms can live in a wider range of salt concentrations. Also, if proteins are not exposed to high salt levels, they do not have to adapt to high salt levels. It requires the organism to use much more energy then the adaption below. \nThe second, less common adaptation, is the selective intake of potassium (K+) ions into the cytoplasm. In exchange, the organism pumps sodium (Na+) ions out with the help of the sodium-potassium pump. Ions of sodium may be used instead of potassium, but potassium is the most common. This adaptation is only used by one order of bacteria and one family of Archaea. An advantage to this method is that it uses much less energy than the adaption above. The main disadvantage to this adaption is that all of the machinery inside the cell (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high levels of non-organic ions, and high salt levels. This is much more demanding than the adaptation described above.\nMost halophilic organisms only use one of the two methods, but a few halophiles can use both.\nCategorization.\nHalophiles are categorized by the levels of salt at which they grow best. Halophiles can either be categorized as slight halophiles, moderate halophiles, or extreme halophiles. Slight halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 2% to 5%. An example of a slight halophile is \"Erythrobacter flavus\". Slight halophiles live in mud on the ocean floor, in seawater, and in garden soil.\nModerate halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 5% to 20%. Examples of moderate halophiles are organisms in the genera \"Desulfovibrio\", \"Desulfocella\", \"Desulfohalobium\", and \"Desulfotomaculum\". Moderate halophiles live in marine salterns, saline lakes, in matter at the bottom of the sea, and in oil brine fields.\nExtreme halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt from 20% to 30%. Examples of extreme halophiles are \"Salinibacter ruber\" and organisms in the Halobacteria class. Extreme halophiles live in the Dead Sea in the Middle East and in man-made solar salterns (lakes used for making sea salt).\nImportance and uses.\nIn nature.\nHalophiles play an important part in ecosystems. For example, halophiles often support entire populations of wild birds. \nHalophiles are useful for cleaning up polluted environments. Waste water with salt concentrations more than 2% is ideal for halophiles to remove organic pollutants from. For instance, halophiles have been shown to remove phenol (a poisonous chemical) from their environments. This could lead to future use in cleaning up oil spills.\nIn fermentation.\nHalophiles play an important part in the fermentation of some foods. For instance, halophiles ferment soy and fish sauces. Halophiles also ferment salted fish.\nIn biotechnology.\nHalophilic microorganisms are useful in biotechnology. The compounds that certain halophiles make are valuable. Some of these compounds are not found anywhere else in the living world. The salt-tolerant enzymes that halophiles produce can be used in a variety of ways. For example, these enzymes could be used for rough industrial processes, like food processing.\nSome moderate halophiles produce sugars outside the cell. These sugars can be used as thickeners and emulsifiers in the petroleum and medicine industries."}

She grew up with her brothers and sisters at Possenhofen Castle. In August 1853, she went to Bad Ischl with her mother and older sister Helene, to celebrate Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph's 23rd birthday. The event was also supposed to be the occasion to announce his engagement to Helene. However, Franz Joseph was so taken by the young and beautiful Elisabeth that he proposed to her instead. \nMarriage.\nElisabeth and Franz Joseph were married in great pomp in Vienna on April 24, 1854. Elisabeth had an informal upbringing, before marrying Franz Joseph. She disliked the much more formal life she had to live at court. Early in the marriage, her mother-in-law, Princess Sophie, took over the care of Elisabeth's daughters. One daughter died in infancy. The birth of her son Rudolf improved her standing at court. Her health suffered under the stress of the court life. She had four children: Sophie (1855-1857), Gisele (1856-1932), Rudolf (1858-1889) and Valerie (1868-1924). \nFranz Joseph and Elisabeth became King and Queen of Hungary in 1867, when the two countries joined together and created the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \nElisabeth suffered from lung disease and melancholia.

She was often away and lived long periods of time abroad, notably in Hungary and at her villa in Corfu. \nHer only son, Rudolf, committed suicide in 1889, after killing his young mistress Marie Vetsera. Empress Elisabeth was assassinated by an Italian anarchist in 1898, while on a visit to Geneva. \nShe has since become something of an historical icon and highly romantic figure, through a series of movies called \"Sissi\" in the 1950s.

This became a farmhouse industry until the first commercial cheese was made in Hawes in 1897. Cheese making continued until May 1992 when the cheese factory closed. Six months later a group of local businessmen, ex-factory workers and cheesemakers, were able to reopen the business and promote Real Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese. This business has become very successful making specialty cheese and now employs more than 200 people.\nWensleydale in popular culture.\nIn the 1990s, sales of the cheese had fallen very low.

No-one can visit the fossil site without an official guide; collecting actual fossils may not be done.\nThe fossils.\nThe fossils are in Mistaken Point's tilted and faulted mudstone and sandstone. They are exposed, visible on the surface. They are part of the Ediacaran biota, the oldest complex (multicellular) life forms. The Ediacaran is the last period in the Proterozoic eon. They date to 579 to 542 million years ago, when all life was in the sea.\nThe Reserve is the only place in the world where you can see a 565-million-year-old sea floor which preserves the ecology of these ancient deep sea communities.\nThis lagerst\u00e4tte includes over 30 types of ancient creatures, most of them extinct groups unknown in our modern world.\nThe palaeoecology.\nThe creatures lived on the bottom of a deep ocean, below the depths that light could reach. What is now Newfoundland was then between latitudes 40\u00b0\u201365\u00b0 South. \nThe imprints of the soft-bodied animals were preserved in place on the muddy sea floor when they were suddenly buried by repeated volcanic ash-falls. The ash (tuff) layers contain zircon, which makes it possible for geologists to accurately date the fossil layers by radiometric dating. Fossils of similar age are found in Russia and Australia, but the variety found at Mistaken Point make the site unique."}

Incheon is the third largest city in South Korea, after Seoul and Busan and 2.6 million people lives in Incheon (2009).\nThere are ten administrative districts in Incheon and it is divided into 8 wards (\"gu\") and 2 counties (\"gun\").\nIncheon Subway and Seoul Metropolitan Subway is linked (line number 1) and it takes approximately an hour from Incheon subway station to Seoul Station. \nHistory.\nThe history of Incheon started from the Goguryeo Kingdom in 475 AD, under the reign of King Jangsu. Its original name was Michuhol and it changed several times and renamed to Incheon-gun in the 13th year of King Taejong\u2019s reign during Joseon period. In 1949, after Korea`s 1945 liberation, Incheon City reorganized. It was finally renamed to Incheon Metropolitan City in 1995. \nDuring the Korean War, there was the battle of Incheon led by an American general of UN Douglas MacArthur and the battle resulted in a decisive victory. It was also a strategic reversal in favor of the United Nations(UN). In a show of gratitude to the American soldier, Koreans in the late 1950s erected the bronze statue of MacArthur in a central park at Incheon that overlooks the sea area through which his troops came ashore.\nCulture and Tourism.\nIncheon is famous for 17th Asian Games,Incheon International Airport, Incheon Port, Songdo International City, Incheon Subway, and Munhak Worldcup Stadium are five major cites of Incheon.\nGanghwa-county.\nGanghwa-county (Ganghwa Island) is famous for dolmens registered as one of the World Heritages by UNESCO.\nHwamunseok mats are Incheon's famous local products, a figured mat. The beauty of these hand-woven mats has made them one of the most famous specialty products of Ganghwa-gun, and one of the most beloved traditional Korean crafts.\nWolmido (Wolmi Island).\nWolmido was once a military base of Japanese Army during the Japanese colonial period and a outpost of the battle of Incheon. Nowadays, Wolmido is one of the most famous tourist spots near the Metropolitan area. Along the 1\u00a0km-long Wolmido Street of Culture, there are lots of beautiful cafes and restaurants. Wolmido is also famous for street performers, portrait artists and Wolmi Festival.\nIncheon Free Economic Zone.\nTo become an international economic hub and a center of business and service industry of Asia, Incheon is developing free economic zone in the three regions of Songdo, Cheongra, and the island of Yeongjong. Incheon's Free Economic Zone, the first in Korea, was officially designated by the Korean government in August 2003 and it is planing to 2020."}

The metric system uses the second as a main unit of time. There are periods of time that are based on the second but shorter. They are named with metric prefixes. Some of these are kiloseconds and milliseconds. Other units of time, like the minute, hour, and day, are accepted for use with the modern metric system, but are not part of it.\nHistory.\nThe metric system was first used in France in 1795. It had units for length, area, dry volume, liquid capacity, weight or mass, and even amounts of money, but not for time. Decimal time of day had been first used in France two years earlier, but was set aside at the same time the metric system was started, and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units. James Clerk Maxwell and Elihu Thomson (through the British Association for the Advancement of Science - BAAS) came up with the Centimetre gram second system of units (cgs) in 1874.\nThe ephemeris second (1/86400 of a mean solar day) was made one of the original base units of the modern metric system, or International System of Units (SI), at the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1954. The SI second was later made even more exact. It was made into the time of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation from the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.\nOther units.\nPeople have had ideas for other base units of metric time (other than the second). On March 28, 1794, Joseph Louis Lagrange, the president of the commission which developed the metric system, wrote a report to the commission. His report suggested the names \"d\u00e9ci-jour\" and \"centi-jour\" (deciday and centiday in English). Base units that are decimal divisions of the day, such as 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, or 1/100,000 day, or other divisions of the day, such as 1/20 or 1/40 day, have also been suggested, with names such as tick, meck, chi, chron, moment, etc. These other units have not caught on with people, however.\nIn computing.\nIn computing, metric time became widely used because it is easy to use with computers. Unix time gives date and time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, and Microsoft's FILETIME as multiples of 100ns since January 1, 1601. VAX/VMS uses the number of 100ns since November 17, 1858 and RISC OS the number of centiseconds since January 1, 1900. (Each of these is not exactly linear, as there are some interruptions with leap seconds.)\nProblems.\nThe main problem with metric time is in the units. The International System of Units has only come up with prefixes for 10 units exponentially in both the multiple and submultiple directions. The first three multiples would be viable for use within a metric time system; they are 101 (decasecond = 10 seconds), 102 (hectosecond = 100 seconds; 1.666 minutes) and 103 (kilosecond = 1\u00a0000 seconds; 16.666 minutes) respectively. However, the fourth value in the SI Units is 106 (megasecond = 1\u00a0000\u00a0000 seconds; 16\u00a0666.666 minutes; 277.777 hours; 11.574 days). Followed by 109 (gigasecond = 1\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 seconds; 16\u00a0666\u00a0666.666 minutes; 277\u00a0777.777 hours; 11\u00a0574.074 days; 31.689 years); a relatively nonviable unit with which to measure human time/life. To make this system of prefixes work for metric time, standard units and prefixes would have to be made for the 4th and 5th exponents to make metric time work for talking about time of human life. These would be:\n104 seconds (10\u00a0000 seconds; 166.6 minutes; 2.777 hours)\n105 seconds (100\u00a0000 seconds; 1\u00a0666.6 minutes; 27.77 hours; 1.157 days)"}

They include the sturgeons, huge fish which provide caviar.\nThe Chondrostei are mainly cartilaginous fish with some ossification. There are 52 species divided among two orders. The orders are the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes), and the Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs). \nThis group has at times been classified with the sharks: the similarities are obvious, not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish. Both lack scales (except the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include spiracles and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin). However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest.\nEvolution.\nIt is thought that the ancestors of the chondrosteans were bony fish but that this characteristic was lost in later evolutionary development, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton which suggests that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish.\nIn the early Mesozoic, a number of fish families were beginning to develop adaptations which would make them lighter, faster and more efficient predators. Chondrosteans took a radical approach. Cartilage is lighter than bone, and they delayed the development of bone, so that it only developed in elderly fish. They lost the upper jaw bones completely. Other changes allowed them to shoot the jaw forwards to grab prey.\nWhy did Chondrosteans react with such total reorganization? Obviously selection pressure must have been very strong. However, in one way they were almost unique. Rarely amongst animals, they underwent polyploidy, several times. Instead of two sets of chromosomes (diploid), the Chondrosteans have 8 or 16 sets of chromosomes. Such a dramatic genetic change may have given the potential for a rapid, drastic reorganization of the body plan.\nParaphyly.\nThe Chondrostei are paraphyletic. The group does not contain all of its descendants. Therefore, sooner or later, it is going to be reorganised."}

Lifeboats are required by law to be on larger ships.\nWhen steamships became commonplace in the 19th century, so did lifeboats. At the beginning of the 20th century larger ships meant that more people could travel, but rules about lifeboats were often overlooked. After the RMS Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, people realized that bigger ships need more lifeboats. The Titanic's lifeboats were only capable of carrying 1,178 people although the Titanic had 3,330 people.\nBecause many lifeboats were needed on the decks of passenger ships this led to the use of most of the deck space being used for lifeboats which created the problem of narrow passageways. This was fixed by inflatable lifeboats being used."}
{"id": "274110", "revid": "590442", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274110", "title": "Overpopulation", "text": "Overpopulation means that the population of a place is too high. Specifically, there are too many organisms of a certain species in a habitat, so the number of organisms living there is larger than the carrying capacity of the habitat. The habitat cannot support these numbers over time without hurting itself.\nThe term \"overpopulation\" is most often used to refer to the number of too many humans living on Earth.\nHuman overpopulation.\nThe world's population has greatly increased in the last 50 years. The main reason is the reduction in death rate, especially for infants and children. The result is that many more people survive to the age when reproduction is possible.\nSteve Jones, head of the biology department at University College London, has said, \nAgainst this background, the reduction in fertility has had little effect, except perhaps in China. The use of the contraceptive pill has transformed the lives of women in rich countries, but has made little impact in poor ones. \nThe recent rapid increase in human population over the past two centuries has raised concerns that humans are beginning to overpopulate the Earth. The planet may not be able to sustain larger numbers of people. The population has been growing since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1400. At the beginning of the 19th century, it had reached roughly 1,000,000,000 (one billion). Rapid population growth occurred all over the world, especially after World War II. By 1960, the world population had reached 3 billion, and it doubled to 6 billion over the next four decades. As of 2011, the estimated annual growth rate was 1.10%, down from a peak of 2.2% in 1963, and the world population stood at roughly 6.9 billion. In 2014, it is over seven billion. \nCurrent projections show a steady decline in the population growth rate, with the population expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the year 2040 and 2050.\nThe scientific consensus is that the present population growth and increase in use of resources is a threat to the ecosystem. The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth called the growth in human numbers \"unprecedented\", and stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution, were made worse by the population expansion. At the time, the world population stood at 5.5 billion, and optimistic scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates show will be reached around 2030.\nLoss of forests.\nWhat were forests have often been turned into farmland. In so doing many species of animals and plants are wiped out, and the CO2 levels in the atmosphere goes up. This is a direct consequence of human population increase.\nPotential solutions.\nThe solutions usually suggested are better education and widespread free contraception (birth control). Many pregnancies are unplanned (40%) or unwanted. \nThere are powerful forces working against birth control. Religious and traditional beliefs often favor large families. Few governments have tackled the problem seriously.\nOthers have proposed that since human population size depends on the amount of food available, like other species, a good method would be to control food production and produce food only for how much is needed rather than more than needed in order to stop birthrates."}

He searched Akihabara to find members who are innovative, because the area has been energetic recently. They are very popular in Japan. The \"AKB\" name comes from Akihabara, which is their home ground. ().\nOn 2012-10-31, AKB48 sold over 20,000,000 records in Japan and became the best selling female group in J-POP history. \nConcept.\nThe group debuted in January 2009. There are 47 members in total. They have their very own theater called the \"AKB48 theater\" () in Akihabara, and they perform there everyday. AKB48's theater is located on the 8th floor of the shopping mall \"Don Quixote Akihabara\" (). The reason for this is because Akimoto wanted to change the idea of idols. Idols usually are presented in an unrealistic way in the media, so Akimoto's idea was to show idols as real people whom fans could interact with. \nThe group became popular for its concept of \"Idols you can meet every day\". Since they perform every day in the theater, in the days when they were less known their fans could visit every day and meet their favorite members afterwards. But now, AKB48 has so many fans that it is not possible to go to the theater every day. Instead, their fans must enter a lottery to win a ticket for the popular theater shows. \nThey also hold \"handshake events\". Fans who buy a CD single of the group can get a ticket to the handshake event, and get the chance to meet a member and shake her hand for ten seconds. \nAlso, there are sister groups such as SKE48, SDN48, NMB48, HKT48, JKT48, SNH48, TPE48 and MNL48. \"SKE\" name is derived from Sakae (),\"NMB\" is from Namba (), \"HKT\" is from Hakata (), \"JKT\" is from Jakarta, \"SNH\" is from Shanghai (), \"TPE\" is from Taipei () and \"MNL\" is from Manila. Also, the name \"SDN\" is derived from \"Saturday Night\". SDN48 consisted of members aged 20 or over. It had a more sexy, adult image, but it eventually split up.\nName.\n\"AKB\" is a short form for Akihabara. During the first phase of this project, the name \"Akihabara 48\" was decided. It is popularly thought that the number 48 means the number of members, but instead it refers to the name of the group's President's office; \"office48\". The office is located in Chiba Prefecture, and in Japanese pronunciation, \"Chiba\" and \"48\" sound similar.\nMembers.\nBecause there are so many AKB48 members, they don't perform all at the same time. Instead, AKB48 consists of 5 teams called \"Team A\", \"Team K\", \"Team B\", \"Team 4\", and \"Team 8\". Most of the group's members are in one of these teams. Each team holds individual performances at the AKB theatre. These performances are a unique set list of around 15 to 20 songs, known as \"stages\". Each team has more than 20 members. For members who do not have enough experience to join a team, they are part of a group of \"research students\". The research students can take the place of a team member during performances if she is sick or unable to perform. When they are thought to have enough experience, they can join a team. \n\"Senbatsu Members\".\nDue to the large number of members, only a few members are picked by their producer when making media appearances. The members picked are called \"senbatsu members\", because \"senbatsu\" is a Japanese word meaning \"selection\". Senbatsu members have \"earned\" the privilege of representing the group during media appearances, and are chosen in different ways. The most famous is the election. \nElection.\nThere are four big elections to decide who sings new songs. You can get tickets to vote in the election when you buy specific CDs or related goods by AKB48. The member who ranks at number one in the election will become the \"center\" of their new song. This means they will stand in the front and center for the dance, and they will get a starring role in the song's music video.\nAKB48 First Election.\nThe first election of AKB48 happened from June 23th to July 7th 2009. The results were announced at a concert venue called Akasaka BLITZ ( BLITZ). The top 21 in this election got the right to sing in their 13th single CD \"Iiwake Maybe\".

This is an aspect of homeostasis: the keeping of a constant internal environment.\nEndotherms.\nSo-called warm-blooded animals control the temperature of their body at quite a high level. This ability is called endothermy. All mammals and birds are endotherms (homeotherms or homoiotherms). The basic source of the heat is chemical energy from the body's metabolism. They have a number of temperature-control devices:\nHibernation.\nIn the colder climates many mammals hibernate or aestivate. This means they have a two-level metabolism. Their temperature is held at a high level when they are active, and at a lower level when they are hibernating. This has the advantage of saving energy during times when they cannot get enough food to keep up the higher temperature.\nHumans.\nThe human body has automatic responses to help regulate temperature. When the external environment heats up, arterioles leading to the capillary loops in the dermis dilate (widen). This increases blood flow to the surface of the skin where its heat can more easily radiate away. This process is called vasodilation. Sweat glands also produce greater amounts of sweat. This liquid is secreted onto the surface of the skin. Sweat needs energy to turn from a liquid into a gas and evaporate. This energy is called the latent heat of vaporisation. The body supplies this heat and so it cools down as the sweat evaporates.\nIf the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. This occurs when the body is exposed to temperatures of approximately 55\u00a0\u00b0C; any exposure longer than a few hours at this temperature or up to around 70\u00a0\u00b0C kills. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia.\nFossil groups.\nPalaeontologists are fairly certain that some fossil groups were endotherms. Obvious examples are pterosaurs, whose bodies were covered by hair (or hair-like filaments), and the smaller carnivorous dinosaurs which evolved feathers (\"dinobirds\"). It is thought that feathers originally functioned to keep body temperature higher. They appear on bird-like dinosaurs before there were any flying birds (\"Anchiornis huxlei\"), and they appear on dinosaurs which are too heavy to fly at all.\nHeterotherms.\nHeterothermy is a term for animals that have features of both ectothermy and endothermy. They can switch between strategies.\nBasic physiology.\nThe fundamental idea is that smaller endothermic animals have, relative to their mass, a larger body surface. \"Heat loss takes place from the surface, and in order to keep warm, an animal must produce heat at a rate equal to its loss\".\nAnimals 'make' heat by the metabolism inside their bodies, but lose heat through their surface (mostly their skin). Now, their bodies are three-dimensional, whereas their surface is two-dimensional. So, if an animal of length X doubles its length, then its surface area increases by about X2, but its body mass increases by about X3. Example:\nThus larger animals are much more \"energy efficient\" than smaller animals. Large animals lose heat \"relatively\" slower than small animals because their surface area is smaller \"in proportion\".\nStrategies for small animals.\nSmall warm-blooded animals have three main tactics for overcoming this problem of heat loss. First, they have a higher metabolic rate than large animals. This is universal in birds and mammals: only the details differ. A higher metabolic rate affects the whole of their lives, and is the main reason why they have shorter lives than large animals.p58/9 The smallest mammals (shrews) and the smallest hummingbirds are about the same size and weight. They have fast heartbeats, up to 1,200 per minute,p129 and they use up more calories per gram than any other endotherms. The rate of oxygen use is similarly high. As a result of the metabolism running at such a high rate, they do produce more heat per gram than any other living things.\nSecond, many allow their temperature to drop at night. Many hummingbirds go into a trance-like torpor at night. \nIn that state, they are less aware and less able to take flight, so there is a greater risk of predators. However, when they are asleep they cannot feed, and at their normal rate of metabolism they need sugar regularly. The torpor is their way of saving energy which they cannot replace until the next day.\nThirdly, almost all endotherms are insulated to reduce heat loss. Obviously that is true of birds (which have feathers) and land mammals (which have fur). Marine mammals have thick layers of fat under their skin, which is better insulation than wet fur. The exceptions are some very large mammals such as elephants, which have almost no fur. Their problem is how to get rid of heat, and that is a problem for all really large land animals. The African elephant's solution is to have large ears, which are well supplied with blood vessels, and to wallow in water if that is available. It is very likely that the same problem affected large dinosaurs. After all, the largest titanosaurs were far larger than any land animal alive today.\nEctotherms.\nEctotherms are what is often called \"cold-blooded\". To function properly they need some heat, and usually this is heat from their surroundings. Many need heat in order to digest their food.\nMany supposedly cold-blooded animals do things to keep their temperature higher than the surrounding air or water. Fast-moving fish, like tunny, and some sharks, keep their temperature above the level of the surrounding water. Reptiles such as lizards and snakes sit in the sun when they are cold and in the shade when they are hot. Some insects control their temperature, especially colonial insects. Termite mounds have 'air conditioning': their system of openings and galleries allows currents of air to flow through the mound. Honey bees fan their wings to cool their colony. However, many smaller invertebrates do not control their body temperature at all.\nThe correct scientific word for cold-blooded is poikilotherm (noun), \"poikilothermic\" (adjective)."}

Auto-Tune uses a ph vocoder to fix pitch in vocal and instrumental performances. It is used to hide out of tune singing and mistakes. It lets singers perform perfectly tuned vocal tracks without needing to sing in tune. Its main purpose is to slightly bend sung pitches to the nearest true semitone. Auto-Tune can also be used as an effect to distort the human voice when pitch is raised/lowered a lot.\nAuto-Tune can be used as a plug-in for professional audio multi-tracking suites used in a studio setting, and as a stand-alone, rack-mounted unit for live performance processing. Auto-Tune has become standard equipment in professional recording studios.\nAuto-Tune was first created by Andy Hildebrand, an engineer working for Exxon. Hildebrand developed methods for interpreting seismic data, and then realized that the technology could be used to detect, analyze, and modify pitch.\nIn popular music.\nAuto-Tune was used for vocal effects on Cher's \"Believe\", recorded in 1998. This was the first major hit song to use the software for this purpose. At first the sound engineers claimed that they had used a vocoder, in what \"Sound on Sound\" said was an attempt to keep a trade secret. After the massive success of \"Believe\", many artists copied the technique, which became known as the \"Cher Effect\". It can be heard in songs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some notable examples are Gigi D'Agostino's \"La Passion\" and Janet Jackson's US Number 1 hit \"All For You\". Auto-Tune became famous again in the mid-2000s when R&amp;B singer T-Pain made active use of it in his songs. This technique has been copied by many other modern R&amp;B and pop artists, including Usher, Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber. T-Pain has even had an iPhone App named after him that copies the effect called \"I Am T-Pain\".\nThe \"Boston Herald\" revealed that country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw have both said they are using Auto-Tune in performance. They said it is a safety net that guarantees a good performance. Sara Evans, John Michael Montgomery and Gary LeVox of the group Rascal Flatts also use Auto-Tune to fix pitch problems. However, other country music singers, such as Loretta Lynn, Allison Moorer, Trisha Yearwood, Vince Gill, Garth Brooks, Martina McBride, and Patty Loveless, have refused to use Auto-Tune.\nYouTube musical group The Gregory Brothers have joined their original music tracks with Auto-Tuned versions of mundane evening news video clips, making fun of everyone from President Barack Obama to Antoine Dodson. The popularity of their YouTube channel led the Gregory Brothers to release many of their songs on iTunes.\nArtist backlash.\nIn 2002, the CD \"Miss Fortune\" by singer-songwriter Allison Moorer was released with a sticker stating that \"Absolutely no vocal tuning or pitch correction was used in the making of this record\". At the 51st Grammy Awards in early 2009, the band Death Cab for Cutie wore blue ribbons to protest the use of Auto-Tune in the music industry. Later that spring, Jay-Z named the lead single of his album \"The Blueprint 3\" as \"D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)\". Jay-Z said that far too many people had jumped on the Auto-Tune bandwagon and that the trend had become a gimmick. Christina Aguilera appeared in public in Los Angeles on August 10, 2009 wearing a T-shirt that read, \"Auto Tune is for Pussies\". However, when interviewed by Sirius/XM, she said that Auto-Tune wasn't bad if used \"..in a creative way\". She said her album \"Bionic\" uses the technology and highlighted \"Elastic Love\" being a product of it.\nCriticism.\nOpponents of the plug-in argue Auto-Tune people will not treat musicians with respect in they need help to stay in tune. A \"Chicago Tribune\" report from 2003 states that \"many successful mainstream artists in most genres of music\u2014perhaps a majority of artists\u2014are using pitch correction\".\nIn 2004, \"The Daily Telegraph\" music critic Neil McCormick called Auto-Tune a \"particularly sinister invention that has been putting extra shine on pop vocals since the 1990s\" by taking \"a poorly sung note and transpos[ing] it, placing it dead center of where it was meant to be\".\nIn 2009, \"Time\" magazine quoted an unnamed Grammy-winning recording engineer as saying, \"Let's just say I've had Auto-Tune save vocals on everything from Britney Spears to Bollywood cast albums. And every singer now presumes that you'll just run their voice through the box.\" The same article hoped \"that pop's fetish for uniform perfect pitch will fade\", commenting that pop-music songs are sounding the same, as \"track after track has perfect pitch.\" Timothy Powell, a producer/engineer stated in 2003 that he is \"even starting to see vocal tuning devices show up in concert settings\"; he states that \"That's more of an ethical dilemma\u2014people pay a premium dollar to see artists and artists want people to see them at their best.\"\nThe American television series \"Glee\" uses Auto-Tune in its songs. E! Online's Joal Ryan criticized the show for its \"overproduced soundtrack\", in particular, complaining that many songs rely too heavily on the software.\nIn 2010, there was controversy when British television reality TV show, \"The X Factor\" had been accused of using Auto-Tune to improve the voices of contestants, especially Gamu Nhengu. Simon Cowell ordered a ban on Auto-Tune for future episodes."}

It is named after the Maasi people, who are the traditional people of the area. Big as it is, the Masai Mara National Reserve is only a fraction of the Greater Mara Ecosystem.\nThe Mara is effectively the northern continuation of the Serengeti National Park game reserve in Tanzania.\nThe Great Migration.\nThis natural event is famous for involving a great population of large mammals. Huge numbers of herbivores migrate each year, followed by the big cats. The zebra, Thomson's gazelle, wildebeest, African buffalo, giraffe, elephants and others arrive to eat fresh grass after the rain, and later move on. Lions, leopards, cheetahs follow, and also vultures and hyaenas. hippos and Nile crocodiles are in the rivers. It is called \"The Great Migration\".\nThe Great Migration is one of the most impressive natural events worldwide. Taking part each year are some 1,300,000 wildebeest, 500,000 Thomson's gazelles, 97,000 Topi, 18,000 eland, and 200,000 zebra. These plant-eating migrants are followed along their annual, circular route by hungry predators, most notably lions and hyena.\nMore than 470 species of birds have been identified in the park, many of which are migrants. Almost 60 species are raptors (birds of prey). Birds that call this area home for at least part of the year include: vultures, marabou storks, secretary birds, hornbills, crowned cranes, ostriches, long-crested Eagles, African pygmy-falcons and the lilac-breasted roller, which is the national bird of Kenya"}

Hayes also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1986, the National Medal of Arts in 1988 and was awarded at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981. Two Broadway theaters are named after her.\nEarly life.\nHayes was born in Washington D.C. on October 10, 1890. She was an only child. Her mother, Catherine Estelle Hayes, was an actress of Irish ancestry. Her father, Francis van Arnum Brown, was a meat salesman. \nHayes was an accomplished child. She went to a dancing school and sang very well. She began a stage career at the age of five, pushed by her mother. She also took her mother's maiden name as her stage name. By the age of ten, she had made a short movie. In 1917 Hayes graduated from the Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent in Washington.\nCareer.\nHer first sound movie \"The Sin of Madelon Claudet\" (1931) brought her Academy Award for Best Actress. The part she played in it was written by her husband, Charles MacArthur. Among her other successful movies of that time were \"Arrowsmith\" (1931), \"A Farewell to Arms\" (1932), \"What Every Woman Knows\" (1934).\nHayes liked working in theatre. Her most famous performance on Broadway was the role of Queen Victoria in a play \"Victoria Regina\" (1938). She played leading parts in \"Coquette\" (1928) and \"Mary Of Scotland\" (1933) as well. \"Harvey\" (1970) became her last hit on stage. Hayes had to retire from theatre because of her asthma condition.\nShe continued her work in movies. Hayes won her second Academy Award in 1970 for \"Airport\". This time for Supporting role.

The most familiar baryons are the protons and neutrons which make up most of the visible matter in the universe. Electrons (the other major component of the atom) are leptons.\nSince all quarks have a spin of 1/2, all baryons have a spin of 1/2 or 3/2 (the spins can cancel out). 1/2 spin baryons have the lowest energy state. 3/2 spin baryons are extremely unstable, and only live for 10-23 seconds. After that, they jump down to a lower energy state by releasing photons containing energy. These 3/2 spin baryons are known as higher energy resonances.\nAll particles with 1/2 spin (or 3/2 spin) are called fermions, and obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. This means that no two fermions can be in the same point in space at the same time. This is not true for the other type of subatomic particle, called a boson.

Shifts in carbon and oxygen isotopes suggest a global warming. \nMajor changes in organisms responsible for calcium carbonate production occurred during the CPE. Carbonate sedimentation stopped in deep water settings of Southern Italy. High extinction rates occurred among ammonoids, conodonts, bryozoa and crinoids.

{"id": "274359", "revid": "7640985", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274359", "title": "Fondue", "text": "Originally, Fondue was a dish where pieces of bread, potatos, or other vegetables were dipped into hot, molten cheese. Fondue is common in Switzerland, Piedmont, and Savoie. With the time, the meaning of fondue was extended: With Fondue bourguinonne, pieces of meat (usually beef) are dipped into hot oil. Fondue chinoise uses stripes of meat which are cooked.\nFondue chinoise and Fondue bouriginonne are served with different sauces or dips. The cheese-based variety uses a mixture of cheese, white wine, and starch to prepare the molten cheese.\nHistory.\nA great number of people believe that fondue is a very old country way to make food of hard cheese and hard bread. Both Swiss and French people make fondue from the old time. It is most likely first made in the Jura mountains.\nThe oldest certain directions for making fondue used eggs and came from Vaud in the early 19th century. A great number of Swiss places and towns came up with very special directions for making fondue based on cheeses, wines and other substances of the town. \nFondue became pleasing to a great number of people in the United States through the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nPreparation.\nIn addition to the bread and cheese, there are side plates of garlic, pickled cucumber, onions and olives.\nTo give a special quality of taste, the \"caquelon\" is first rubbed with a cut garlic. Wine and cheese are added and heated and moved till they are warm and liquid. A small amount of starch is added to join the substances. Some strong alcohol from cherries is added just before bringing it to the table.\nThe most common directions use 1 decilitre of dry white wine and 200 grams of cheese for every person. The cheese is a mix of hard cheese (such as \"Gruy\u00e8re\") and semi-hard (such as Emmental cheese).\nTemperature and \"La Religieuse\".\nA cheese fondue would be kept at a temperature warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not at a great heat to cause burning. \nIf the temperature is good, there will be a thin hard cover of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the lowest part of the \"caquelon\". \nThis is the \"la religieuse\" (French for \"the nun\"). It has the structure of a thin cracker and is lifted out and every person is given a bit. In Switzerland sometimes boys and girls fight over the burnt cheese at the lowest part of the \"caquelon\".\nOther fondues.\n\"Fondue Bourguignonne\" is named after Burgundy in France. Fondue Bourguignonne uses a pot of heated oil to cook. Bits of meat are put into the oil to quickly cook them. A number of sauces are made ready on the side. The earliest statements of this dish seem to have been made in the 1950s.\n\"Fondue Chinoise\" uses a pot of heated liquid to cook. Thin bits of meat (often beef) are put into a very warm thin meat soup. As with a Fondue Bourguignonne, a number of sauces are made ready on the side. At the end of the meal, the liquid from the pot is drunk as a thick soup.\n\"Chocolate Fondue\" was first made in the 1960s. Slices of fruit or cake are put in a pot of warm, liquid chocolate.\nGood behavior.\nIt would not be good to touch the fork with the tongue, because the fork will go back into the common pot. At a meat fondue, one uses a second fork to take meat off the fork that goes into the common pot. \nIn Switzerland what has been done for a long time, is that if a bit of bread is lost in the cheese by a man, he gives money for a bottle of wine. If it is lost by a woman, she kisses the man at her left."}

It can also be got indirectly by contact with dirty hands or objects.\nInfection is spread by ingesting the cyst form of the parasite. This tough and semi-dormant structure is found in faeces. Since amoebiasis is transmitted by contaminated food and water, it is often endemic in parts of the world with poor sanitation (such as M\u00e9xico, Central America, western South America, South Asia, and western and southern Africa).\nAmoebic dysentery is often confused with \"traveller's diarrhoea\" because of its prevalence in developing nations. In fact, most traveller's diarrhoea is bacterial or viral in origin.\n\"E. histolytica\" infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver. So, two different classes of drugs are needed to treat the infection, one for each location. Such anti-amoebic drugs are known as \"amoebicides\"."}

Because it looked like a turtle, it has been called \"Turtle ship.\"\nShape.\nOutside.\nIt has a dragon-shaped head, which can fire cannons through its mouth. Its tail can also fire artillery. \"Turtle ship\" has 12 cannons in each side, so total cannons are 24. As lots of iron nails are stuck in its back, nobody can approach it easily. Moreover, people who are in the \"Turtle ship\" can see the outside, while exterior people cannot look into it.\nInside.\nIts inside is divided into two floors, one of which is the place where cannons are and the other is where people can row. There are twenty four rooms. Nineteen of them are where soldiers can take a rest. Other three of them are where some weapons, such as swords, arrows and spears, are. In the other three rooms, iron goods can be stored. On the bottom, there is a huge water tank, which can make \"Turtle ship\" float and sink.\nScale.\nAt first, \"Turtle ship\" was a small warship which can hold about 100~150 soldiers. However, after the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, it expanded from a two-storied warship to a three-storied one and its hull is longer.\nPerformance.\nOffensive Disposition.\nIt has several cannons from front to back and side to side, including a dragon-shaped head. Therefore, it take an important role in breaking through the enemy lines at the head of fleets. In addition, it is assumed that iron nails stuck in its back might hit and sink enemy ships with the water tank fulled.\nDefensive Disposition.\nBecause it has iron nails and wooden boxes covered with swords in the back, it is distinguished in warding off attacks against enemies.\nManeuverability.\nIt has ten paddles in each side, and four rowers are arranged to one paddle. As its bottom is flat-shaped, it's really easy to maneuver in large tidal ranges, such as The West Sea and The South Sea of Korean Peninsula. It's also possible to do a half-turn in the middle of moving. For these reasons, it's useful in using various techniques of maneuver."}

However, humans can spread FMD by carrying the virus on their clothes and body. FMD breaks out all over the globe, because it is highly contagious to many animals. The earliest description of FMD was that by Hieronymi Fracastorii (1546).

Various types of FMD virus have been found in Africa, South America, Asia, and some parts of Europe.\nSymptoms.\nThe most obvious signs of Foot and Mouth Disease are excessive slobbering (letting liquid fall from their mouth), a lack of appetite and lameness (unable to walk properly because of damage to one or both of their legs). Affected animals may experience a sudden rise in temperature, sores in the mouth or other areas.\nCauses.\nFMD is caused by a virus. Signs of illness can appear after an incubation period (the time from the moment of exposure to an infectious agent until signs and symptoms of the disease appear) of one to eight days, but often develop within three days. Immunity to one type does not protect an animal against other types."}

At a time when most artists worked in the Gothic style, Nicola was influenced by the Ancient Roman sculpture that he saw at Pisa, and copied the style into his own work. For this reason Nicola Pisano is sometimes said to be to be the founder of modern sculpture.\nWorks.\n \nAt Pisa.\nNicola Pisano's birthdate and exact birthplace are unknown. A document in the archives of Siena Cathedral says that he was the son of Petrus de Apulia. In 1245 Nicola was making sculptures at Prato Cathedral and then moved to Pisa where his son Giovanni Pisano was born.\nAround 1255, Nicola received a commission (a paid job) to make the pulpit in the baptistery of Pisa Cathedral. The baptistery was a very large circular domed building that stood near the west doors of the cathedral. Nicola was assisted (helped) by other sculptors including Arnolfo di Cambio who later became a famous architect. The work was finished in 1260 and signed \"Nicola Pisanus\" which means \"Nicholas of Pisa\".\nThe pulpit is hexagonal (six-sided) and is supported on six columns of coloured stone, with another column under the centre of the pulpit. Four of the columns, including the central one, rest on the backs of carved creatures. Around five sides of the pulpit are white marble panels carved with stories from the life of Jesus. They are the \"Annunciation\" (telling of Jesus' birth to Mary), the \"Nativity\" (birth of Jesus), \"Angels telling the Shepherds\", the \"Adoration of the Magi\" (the Three Wise Men), \"Baby Jesus presented at the Temple\", and the \"Crucifixion\".\nAt Pisa Cathedral was a large cloister (a courtyard surrounded by arches) called the Campo Santo and used as a burial place. All around the arcade in the Campo Santo were Ancient Roman \"sarcopgagi\" (stone coffins), that had been stolen by the navy of Pisa when they had won a battle. Many of the coffins were richly carved with scenes that told stories. The biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote that Nicola Pisano studied these sculptures before he started work on the carvings for the pulpit. Because of this, Nicola's sculpture makes a bridge between the Gothic style of the 1200s, and the Classical style used by Renaissance artists in the 1400s. \nThe Baptistery of Pisa had been built by an architect called Diotisalvi, but the work was not finished. Nicola Pisano made the dome much higher, and put decoration all around it which 20 years later had sculpture added by Nicola's son Giovanni Pisano.\nAt Bologna and Siena.\nIn 1264 Nicola Pisano was aksed to work on a grand shrine in memory of St Dominic, called the \"Arca di San Domenico\" in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. It is believed that Nicola made the main design but many other sculptors worked on it. More than 200 years later, it was still not finished, and Michelangelo, when he was still a teenager, made three small statues for it.\nIn September 1265 Nicola began work on another a marble pulpit, even grander than the first, this time for Siena Cathedral. The work took three years, and Nicola was helped by his son Giovanni Pisano and his assistants Arnolfo di Cambio, Lapo di Ricevuto and several other artists.\nThe pulpit is octagonal in shape and is supported on nine columns, made of granite, porphyry and green marble..\nThe message of this pulpit is Salvation and the Last Judgment. It has seven sculptured scenes and many small statues. Three of the scenes tell more than one story. All the panels are crowded with figures. \nAt Pistoia and Perugia.\nIn July 1273 Nicola Pisano was commissioned to make the altar in the Chapel of St James in Pistoia Cathedral. The chapel was demolished and all that remains is a basin for Holy Water, that was possibly made by Nicola.\nHis last main job, from 1277-78, was to make the sculpture panels to surround a very large fountain in the main square of the city of Perugia. (1277\u20131278). The fountain was designed by Fra Bevignate and Boninsegna. It is thought that most of the sculpture was done by his son Giovanni Pisano. and his assistants."}

Fleeing England with her governess aged three, she moved to the court of her first cousin Louis XIV of France. She was known as \"Minette\". She married Philippe of France, \"Monsieur\", brother of King Louis XIV, and became known as \"Madame\" at court. Very popular with the court, Henriette was known for her flirtatious nature which was the cause of various arguments between husband and wife.

Henriette was instrumental to the completion of the \"Secret Treaty of Dover\" prior to her unexpected death in June 1670.

Before Zhou Dynasty, there was Shang Dynasty (1600 BC - 1046 BC). Shang Dynasty's main cultural characteristics are its divination and character (old Chinese character). We cannot say which one was first, but it is supposed that characters were made from certain need while doing divination. During Shang Dynasty, divination was done by burning animal's bone or tortoise shell. Zhou Dynasty made Shang cease to exist, but it accepted Shang's culture. In early age of Zhou Dynasty, a new way of divination appeared which was put into writing. It was advanced form of Shang Dynasty's divination, and finally, it took place instead of Shang's divination.\nThe Contents of I Ching.\nThe contents of I Ching consist of 64 hexagrams and explanation for each. Hexagram is a group of six broken or unbroken lines. The broken line (the line where the middle part is missing) represents yang, and the unbroken line represents yin. From the bottom to top, six lines are gathered in parallel. There exists one different name for one hexagram. In I Ching, the name of one hexagram and the hexagram itself comes first, and after those, there are different explanations for the hexagram and the each line consisting hexagram, from bottom to top. There comes next hexagram after explanations of all lines of one hexagram.\nTools For I Ching Divination.\nThe typical divination using I Ching needs the number of fifty thin sticks usually made from bamboo. Using those sticks with certain order, the person who wants to know the result draws hexagram and finds the explanation in the book. To make process simpler, some people use coin to know the result.\nPhilosophical Elements.\nIn I Ching, the word 'Heaven'(or sky; it corresponds to the Chinese character '\u5929') is considered as same as God or the absolute being with humane character, who decides the good and evil and makes judgements. For example, the explanation of 26th hexagram (\u5927\u755c d\u00e0 ch\u00f9) is \"the Heaven's bliss is given, therefore, lucky.\"\nAlso, there is the idea of constantly changing world, as the explanation of 11th hexagram (\u6cf0 t\u00e0i) tells, \"Everything flat will be inclined, and everything gone will be come back.\" Similarly, the idea of endlessness can also be found. The literal meaning of 63rd hexagram (\u65e2\u6fdf j\u00ec j\u00ec) is \"already (\u65e2) finished (\u6fdf)\", but the last hexagram, which is the 64th (\u672a\u6fdf w\u00e8i j\u00ec), means \"not (\u672a) finished (\u6fdf)\" literally. This means the process of whole world and life is endless and never stops."}

A typical implementation of SQR codes would be to create a one-time use SQR code on a mobile phone's screen to effectively create a highly secure one-time pad type of encryption of, for example, an online account number. \nA typical implementation is to encrypt and use a precursor physical machine readable token such as the card identity number (CID) written in read-only memory (ROM) of a Secure Digital microSD card contained in a mobile telephone. The international mobile identity number may be used where no microSD card is present, for example, on an Apple iPhone. \nSQR codes may be securely read in a retail environment at the point of sale using 2D barcode scanners or even a low cost web camera.

It began in 918 with Emperor Taejo. The name \"Goryeo\" came to be said as \"Korea\" by foreigners and is still the name of the country. Goryeo united the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea (Later Baekje, Later Goguryeo, and Silla) and by 1374 ruled most of the Korean peninsula until it was removed by the Joseon dynasty in 1392. Goryeo increased its borders to Chung-cheon river and Youngheong (936~943) and the Amnok River (933).\nBackground.\nSilla had accomplished a unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea in 668. But it weakened as local lords achieved power during the end of the 9th century. The country entered a period of civil war and rebellion, led by Gung Ye, Gi Hwon, Yang Gil, and Gyeon Hwon. Gung Ye established Hugogureo (meaning \"Later Goguryeo\") and Wang Geon (Later, Tae jo) made a contribution as Gung Ye's subordinate. However, Gung Ye became more and more tyrannical and finally killed his own wife and son. Also he insisted that he was Maitreya (the future Buddha). Meanwhile, Wang Geon increased his power as he conquered Geumsung area in Later Baekje. Finally, some people who followed Wang Geon broke out the rebellion and he named the dynasty as Goryeo and changed its capital city to Song-ak. \nGoryeo made the policy to win the favor of people and maintained good relationship with Silla. As a result, Silla surrendered unconditionally to Goryeo. Meanwhile, Later Baekje collapsed by itself as princes fought each other over uccession to the throne. Because of the internal conflict, Later Baekje became weaker and weaker and was conquered by Goryeo. Finally, Goryeo united the Later Three Kingdoms again (936) and accomplished re-unification of Korean people. \nTae jo made important policies. First, he insisted that Goryeo should expand its territory to further North. It is because he succeed to Goguryeo (ancient Korean kingdom founded in 37 BC\u2013668) and Goguryeo had the biggest territory in Korean history. So, Tae jo named the dynasty as Goryeo from Goguryeo and tried to take back the territory of Goguryeo. He emphasized the importance of Sukyung area because it is placed in the North part and kept in check Gu Ran (kind of Mongolian) that made an effort to come down to Goryeo. Later, all of these policies contributed to expanding its territory to Apnok River. Also, Tae Jo made the policy which unified all people from different dynasties (Baekje, Silla, Goguryeo, Balhae..). Because of this policy, Goryeo is considered that it accomplished actual unification compared to Silla."}

The Chinese also call it \"Zheda\" or \"Zju\" for short. Known as the \u201cCambridge of the East\u201d, it is one of the universities that was involved in Project 211 and Project 985 in the first group, and also a member of C9 League. \nWhat's more, it also be selected as the member of the Project 111 and Project Zhufeng \nHistory.\nThe current Zhejiang University was formed officially in 1998, but the main root of it, Qiushi Academy, dates back to 1897 in Qing Dynasty. At that time, Qiushi Acedamy was one of the earliest modern academies of higher education in China. During 1901 to 1927, the name of Qiushi Academy was changed a lot of times as Zhejiang Academy, Zhejiang Advanced College, Yuying Academy, etc. In 1928, it was officially named as National Zhejiang University. After the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out in 1937, Zhejiang University started to move to the west of China, which is called \u201cLong March of Culture\u201d. Under the leading of Chu Kochen, Zhejiang University was directed towards one of the leading universities in China and attained a series of achievement in teaching and researching. And in 1944, it was honored as \u201cOriental Cambridge\u201d by Joseph Needham, the famous British scholar who visited Zhejiang University twice. As the Resistance Against Japan went to the end, Zhejiang University moved back to Hangzhou at 1946 and in 1951 it already became a comprehensive university. In 1952, due to the nationwide Renovation of educational systems, Zhejiang University was restructured and separated into 15 institutions. Up to the four universities with the same semester merged into the new Zhejiang University in 1998, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou University, Zhejiang Agricultural University, Zhejiang Medical University focused on the research and teaching in their own field and trained a large number of outstanding professionals. And finally at Sep.15th 1998, the new Zhejiang University was formed and developed rapidly during the past 12 years and made every effort to build itself as one of the first-class university in the world. \nSchool Motto.\nThe Motto of Zhejiang University is \u201dSeeking Truth and Innovating \u201d (Chinese \u6c42\u662f\u5275\u65b0).\n\u201cSeeking truth\u201d can trace to the main root of Zhejiang University ---\u201cQiushi Academy\u201d. The first time it was formally put forwards at 10th. Nov. 1938, the opening ceremony in Guangxi Yishan by President Coching Chu, and the motion was carried in the regular meeting of school affairs. Since then the Scientific Spirit, Dedicated Spirit, Revolutionary Spirit and innovative spirit derived from Qiushi Spirit. \nAt 5th. May. 1988, in the meeting of school affairs hosted by the President Lu Yongxiang, \u201cInnovating\u201d was added into the School Motto, which emphasis the pioneering and innovative spirit in the new historical conditions.\nSchool Logo.\nThe logo consists of two circles. The \u201cZhejiang University\u201d written in both Chinese and English signify that Zhejiang University has already opened to the word. And the \u201c1987\u201d means that the year Zhejiang University was founded.

It is often called \"C. diff\" (pronounced \"see diff\"). It is a gram-positive bacteria which belongs to the genus \"Clostridium\". \n\"C. diff \"can live in the human colon (the large intestine) without causing any problems. About 2-5% of adults have \"C. diff\" living in their colons. However, in some people, \"C. diff \"causes serious illness. In these people, \"C. diff \"bacteria grow out of control in the colon. The bacteria attack the lining of the intestines. This causes a problem called \"C. diff \"colitis. Colitis is inflammation (swelling) of the colon.\n\"C. diff \"infection is getting more and more common in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities. It kills about 14,000 people a year just in the United States. \n\"C. diff\" infection.\nThe most common symptom of \"C. diff \"infection is severe diarrhea. \"C. diff \"infection can also cause fever, belly pain, loss of appetite (not wanting to eat), and nausea. \nSome cases of \"C. diff\" infection are not very serious. In other cases, people get very sick and even die. When people experience severe diarrhea from \"C. diff\" infection, they may become badly dehydrated (not have enough fluid in their bodies). This can damage the kidneys leading to renal failure. \"C. diff\" bacteria can also eat a hole in the intestines (perforation), which is very dangerous.\nOnce a person has \"C. diff\" infection, they can spread the infection to other people. \"C. diff \"can live for a long time on surfaces like doorknobs, sheets, and medical equipment. If a person with \"C. diff \"infection does not clean their hands, they can spread the bacteria to other people on their hands.\nWho gets \"C. diff\" infection?\n\"C. diff\" infection usually happens in people who are taking antibiotic medicine. Usually, the intestines are filled with good, healthy bacteria. These healthy bacteria keep \"C. diff\" bacteria under control. If antibiotic medicines kill the healthy bacteria, \"C. diff\" bacteria can grow out of control.\n\"C. diff\" infection is also more common in:\nHow is \"C. diff \"infection treated?\n\"C. diff \"infection can be treated with some antibiotic medicines. However, \"C. diff\" is an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This means that many antibiotic medicines cannot kill \"C. diff\". This can make \"C. diff\" infection very difficult to treat. Many people with \"C. diff\" infection have relapses (they get better for a while, but then get sick again). This happens to about one in every five people with \"C. diff\" infection. \nUsually, doctors try an antibiotic called metronidazole as the first treatment for \"C. diff\" infection. About three in every four people with \"C. diff\" infection get better after taking metronidazole for ten days. When metronidazole does not work, doctors give other antibiotics, usually vancomycin or fidoxamacin.\nIn severe cases of C. diff infection which do not get better with antibiotics, doctors may do surgery to remove parts of the colon.\nFecal transplantation, especially for those with recurrent \"C. diff\" infections, has been shown to be more effective than oral vancomycin.\nHow can \"C. diff\" infection be prevented?\nUsually, \"C. diff \"infection can be prevented. Hand-washing is one of the best ways to prevent \"C. diff\" infection. If a person has \"C. diff\" bacteria on their hands, they can kill the bacteria by washing their hands with soap and water. \"C. diff\" bacteria on surfaces (like doorknobs and medical equipment) can be killed with bleach. Many hospitals and other health care facilities have special bleach wipes which kill \"C. diff\". Washing sheets and clothes with bleach and detergent also kills \"C. diff\".\nAlcohol does not kill \"C. diff\", so instant hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes will not keep \"C. diff\" bacteria from spreading.\nHospitals and other health care facilities can also use \"\"C. diff\" precautions\" to prevent \"C. diff\" from spreading.

It measures how well a person uses listening, reading, speaking and writing skills to perform academic tasks. This test is accepted by more than 10 000 colleges, universities, and agencies in more than 150 countries; which means it is the most widely recognized English test in the world.\nThe format of the TOEFL test has been changed three times. The first was the PBT (paper-based TOEFL test). It tests listening, reading and grammar skills with a perfect score being 677 (Paper Based). Some centers where computers are not available still offer this format. The second format is the CBT (computer-based TOEFL test). People are each provided with a computer to take the test. A writing section was added as well as the three sections. The level of listening and grammar skills are automatically changed depending on a person\u2019s English level. The third change is the iBT (Internet-based test) that is being brought in around the world which measures listening, speaking, reading and writing.\nThere are three procedures that people are following to take the test. First it is decided where and when you are going to \ntake the test because the format of the test could be either iBT or CBT depending on location. People need to register 2\u20133 months in advance to get a place. Second is registration in person, online, by phone, or through email. Online registration is most common and payment will be required to complete the registration. The cost changes depending on what kind of exam is taken.\nAs more universities and colleges want a TOEFL more people are wanting to do the test. In Korea in 2010, nearly 115,000 people took the test to demonstrate their ability in English. This was 20% of the total for people doing the test. It is considered as one of the ways for middle or high school students to apply for the high ranked domestic universities.

It is one of the most important positions. A point guard should maintain his team's offense by controlling the ball safely and pass the ball to the right teammate at the right time. Because of his role in the play, a point guard is usually called a commander on the court. Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry and John Stockton are famous point guards in the NBA.\nRequired abilities to play as a point guard.\nFirst of all, right pass is the most important requirement to be a good point guard. A point guard's first thought should be being an excellent passer and getting the ball to his teammates for easy shots. Because the offense is usually started from a point guard who handles the ball, he should be able to find the open man, and when to pass and not pass to avoid costly turnovers and score easily.\nSecond, safe dribbling and ball handling are necessary. Before a point guard passes the ball to his teammates, he should carry the ball from back court to front court. To carry the ball safely without turnovers, it is important to know how to control the ball safely. And by controlling the ball safely, a point guard also can control the tempo of the game. The ability, controlling the tempo, make a point guard choose right way to offense, a fast-break or a slow-attack. Through choosing right strategy, a point guard can make chance at the right time and also save his teammate's stamina effectively. \nThird, a point guard is a coach on the court. To command proper strategy to his teammates, a point guard should understand all strategies which are commanded by his coach. This ability may help a point guard to play the game well with the right strategy at right time.\nLastly, a point guard should be a good shooter. Sometimes the game can be unfavorable, even a point guard pass well and play the game with right strategy. At this time his accurate shooting can be an escapeway from this situation. By announcing his ability to shooting accurately, a point guard can plant an awareness to opponents that they should defense him well. And it cause the decreasing of pressure to other teammates to offense. Like this, a point guard's shooting ability can be the option to offense effectively."}

The entrep\u00f4t sells the goods at a higher price to others travelling the rest of the route. In modern times customs areas have largely made such entrep\u00f4ts obsolete.\nThis type of port should not be confused with the modern French use of the word \"entrep\u00f4t\" meaning warehouse.\nHistory.\nEntrep\u00f4ts date back to the middle ages. The Vikings established trade routes with entrep\u00f4ts at Dublin, Wexford and Waterford. An example of a Colonial American entrep\u00f4t was in Rhode Island between 1690 and 1765."}

The adventure of this bold thief earns a controversial reputation \u2014 the rage or fury of police officers who keep missing him on the scene of robbery, and even in the jail, and the admiration from citizens who love to check up on the newspapers to see if there's any article about his great robberies. Lupin is portrayed as patriotic, romantic, audacious, self-respecting, and respectful to women.\nBackstory.\nLupin was born in 1874. His father was a gymnastics teacher and taught him boxing and fencing which later became Lupin's attacking specialties. He was raised by a nanny Victoire, and their relationship lasted until the end of the series. His parents got divorced, and his mother started working for a relative who is fairly arrogant. In the house of the relative, Lupin robs a necklace as revenge. Until eighteen, he had been learning law, medicine, acting, and martial arts. His journey as a thief starts at age eighteen.\nIn addition to his real name, he likes using several fake names, such as Sernine and Perenna. They have different jobs, which vary from famous traveller to retired general. He sometimes disguises himself as a detective, and solves lots of mysterious incidents, and becomes famous. He usually buys a kind of identification card from an unknown and recently dead man, and uses his name.\nThe ending of his life is not clear, because the author, Maurice Leblanc, was dead in 1941 before completing \"Le Dernier Amour d'Ars\u00e8ne Lupin\" (), the 21st volume of the series. Leblanc was presented the French Legion of Honour award for inspiring the patriotism and pride of French people by his Lupin series. He bought a house in Etretat and named it \"Le Clos Lupin\" (the vacation of lupin), which is still famous as a tourist attraction."}

Production began on October 13, 2001. It is planned to produce 484 of them by 2010. The K2 Black Panther is planned to replace it after that.\nThe reason for the upgrade was to increase the fire power of the K1. The main 105mm gun was replaced with the M256 120mm gun. The M256 122mm has 1.5 times the range and 1.7 times stronger fire power than the older gun. It also changed its armor, called Korean Special Armor Plate (KSAP), which greatly improved its side shield.\nThe K1A1 weighs about 53.2 tons and can seat four people. Besides the main gun, there are two kinds of machine guns, 12.7mm K6 and two 7.62mm M60s as secondary arms. Guns and a turret are able to move independently of the main body. This improves its accuracy rate.\nThe K1A1 is designed for Korea\u2019s mountainous land. It provides a smoother ride as well as higher speed driving on a sloping hill, compared to the K1. The maximum speed is around 65km/h on the level ground, 40km/h on the mountains. Its fire control system involves KCPS (Korea Commander\u2019s Panoramic Sight), KGPS (Korean Gunners Primary Sight), digital ballistic calculator, and some minor factors. The notable fact is that the development of this system was mostly done by Korean technology."}

In Chinese, \"bo\", \"po\", \"mo\" and \"fo\" are the first four of the conventional ordering of available syllables. As a result, the four syllables together have been used to refer to many different phonetic systems. For Chinese speakers who were first introduced to the Zhuyin system, \"bopomofo\" means \"zhuyin fuhao\".\nThe zhuyin characters are represented in typographic fonts as if drawn with an ink brush (as in Regular Script). They are encoded in Unicode in the bopomofo block, in the range U+3105 ... U+312D.\nHistory.\nAfter the overthrow of China's last emperor during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, the new government in China created Zhuyin to help the common people read more easily. However, the Chinese Communist Party, including Mao Zedong himself, wanted to ban writing Chinese characters altogether and replace them with the Latin alphabet. When the People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang (the founding party of the Republic of China) in 1949 and sent them off to exile in Taiwan, the use of Zhuyin dropped in mainland China because the CPC was interested in using the Latin alphabet for writing Chinese phonetically. However, Zhuyin is still widely used in Taiwan as it is used to type Chinese on computer and phone keyboards.\nFeatures.\nZhuyin was made to closely represent the sounds of Mandarin Chinese. Symbols are divided into two categories, the initials (the first sounds in a syllable) and the finals (the main vowel, the glide consonants ([y/i; IPA:/j/] and [w/u; IPA:/w/]) that come before the main vowel and all the sound that comes after it). There are 4 tone marks to represent the 5 Mandarin tones."}

Most known photoreactions begin when light creates a free radical in the reaction system. Light can have a lot of energy and is able to break chemical bonds. For example some things fade or lose their color when left in sunlight. When light breaks the chemical bonds, free radicals are produced. A free radical is a molecule, atom or an ion that needs an electron. The free radical will take electrons from other molecules or atoms and this starts chemical reactions.\nTerms and background.\nPhoto- is a prefix showing that light is involved.\nPhotolysis is when light cuts (breaks bonds) of a molecule.\nIn a chemical reaction there are reactants also called reagents that you begin with. Once the reaction takes place you have products. In the example below methane \n(CH4) and oxygen (O2) are the reactants and carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are the products.\n\"CH4 + 2O2 \u2192 CO2 + 2H2O\"\nCatalysis.\nCatalysis is using a catalyst to change the rate of a chemical reaction. For the reactants to become the products the reaction must overcome an energy barrier. This energy barrier is known as the activation energy (Ea). For example, when you lit the methane gas you are providing the activation energy to burn(react). \nRate.\nRate is how fast or slow a chemical reaction happens.\nCatalyst.\nCatalyst is a substance present but not consumed in a reaction like the other reagents while increasing the rate of the reaction. The graph below shows the catalyst\u2019s effect on the activation energy. The Y (vertical) axis shows the activation energy while the x (horizontal) axis shows the reaction over time. With no catalyst present (black line) the reaction has a higher energy to overcome. In the presence of a catalyst (red line) the activation energy is reduced.\nLight.\nIn a vacuum light travels at c, c= 2.99792458X108 m/s that\u2019s 186,000 miles in one second.\nThe up and down pattern is how we show light. The high points are called crests and the low are called troughs. Light has three characteristics that we use to describe it. Wavelength (\u03bb) is the distance between two peaks that are next to each other. Frequency (\u03bd) is the number of times a unit of light can pass by a point over time. Amplitude is the vertical distance between a peak and the next trough. \nResearch and uses.\nPhotocatalysis is getting more attention from the scientific community due to the \u201cgreen movement\u201d \nAn example of organometallic research is mimicking photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to make sugar for food. Plants use only carbon dioxide gas from the air, water and sunlight. Plants actually have an organometallic molecule containing Mn that helps them perform this reaction. Scientists hope to make an organometallic molecule that can make organic products like fuels using only carbon dioxide, water and light. If this process could be harnessed it could dramatically reduce pollution, because the carbon you make your fuel with is the carbon dioxide from the air."}

The electron cloud of an atom bends the X-rays slightly. This makes a \"picture\" of the molecule that can be seen on a screen. It can be used for both organic and inorganic molecules. The sample is not destroyed in the process.\nThe technique was jointly invented by Sir William Bragg (1862\u20131942) and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg (1890\u20131971). They won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915. Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to be made a Nobel Laureate. He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson , Francis Crick , Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin in February 1953.\nThe oldest method of X-ray crystallography is X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-rays are fired at a single crystal and the way they are scattered produces a pattern. These patterns are used to work out the arrangement of atoms inside the crystal.\nX-ray analysis of crystals.\nCrystals are regular arrays of atoms, meaning that the atoms are repeated over and over in all three dimensions. X-rays are waves of electromagnetic radiation. When X-rays meet atoms, the electrons in the atoms cause the X-rays to scatter in all directions. Because the X-rays are emitted in all directions, an X-ray striking an electron produces secondary spherical waves emanating from the electron. The electron is known as the \"scatterer\". A regular array of scatterers (here the repeating pattern of atoms in the crystal) produces a regular array of spherical waves. Although these waves cancel one another out in most directions, they add up in a few specific directions, determined by Bragg's law:\nHere \"d\" is the spacing between diffracting planes, formula_2 is the incident angle, \"n\" is any integer, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the beam. These specific directions appear as spots on the diffraction pattern called \"reflections\". Thus, X-ray diffraction results from an electromagnetic wave (the X-ray) hitting a regular array of scatterers (the repeating arrangement of atoms within the crystal)."}

Certain atoms' nuclei have certain magnetic properties when placed in a strong magnetic field. Atoms like carbon, hydrogen, and fluorine can be detected in this way.\nHow an NMR works.\nA chemical sample is prepared by placing a tiny amount of the sample in an NMR tube. It is dissolved in a special solvent like heavy water (see deuterium) or chloroform-d, then the tube is placed into the NMR machine. The machine is a large magnet, like an MRI. Some atoms in the sample will become excited when it is in the magnet, and when the sample is removed, the atoms will go back to a lower energy state. A computer connected to the NMR can detect this change in excitement and it will cause different peaks and bumps to appear on the NMR diagram. A chemist can print this diagram and study the various peaks. \nMost NMR machines can only detect excitement from one type of atom. For example, an 1H NMR can only \"see\" hydrogen atoms. A 13C NMR can only see activity from carbon atoms.\nNMR Diagram.\nAn NMR diagram displays an x-axis with units of parts per million, or \"shift.\" Peaks that occur farther to the left in the diagram (these peaks are said to be shifted downfield) represent hydrogen atoms that are closer to electronegative atoms like oxygen or nitrogen, or connected to an aromatic (benzene) ring. Hydrogen atoms that are adjacent to other hydrogen atoms can split peaks as well. If there are n hydrogen atoms \"next door\" to a single one, that single one's peak will be split into n+1 peaks. For example, if a hydrogen atom is adjacent to three others, that hydrogen atom will be split into 4 smaller peaks, called a quartet. Hydrogen atoms that are part of O-H or N-H bonds won't be split, but they will appear on the diagram as a rounded lump, called a broad peak. By looking at all these factors in a diagram, a chemist can figure out what compounds are in his or her sample, and they can determine if the compound they have made is pure. "}

England paid for the costs of this service, since the country wanted a more regular service than the sailing ships of the time could do. Cunard started with four steam ships that made crossings of the Atlantic Ocean once a week. The company became known for its record of good safety\u2013while ships of other companies often sank, killing many people, these sorts of things rarely happened to Cunard.\nBy the early 1900s, though, Cunard was faced with many other ships from several countries also competing with it for passengers going across the Atlantic. This caused the company to build three new ships, larger and faster than the ones before them. They were named RMS \"Mauretania\", RMS \"Lusitania\" and RMS \"Aquitania\". Theses ships made Cunard back into a leading shipping line, even though \"Lusitania\" was sunk during World War I by a German submarine, killing 1,200 people.\nIn 1934, another big Cunard ship, the RMS \"Queen Mary\", began service. She was the largest ship ever built at that time. During World War II, \"Queen Mary\" and another new ship like her, \"Queen Elizabeth\", carried many soldiers to support England and the US.\nBy the 1960s, people preferred to cross the Atlantic by jet airplanes rather than by ships, so Cunard sold most of their ships, or made them cruise ships instead of ocean liners. Cunard still decided to build one new ocean liner, though, RMS \"Queen Elizabeth 2\". She started service in 1969 and became a very popular ship because she made both cruises and crossings of the Atlantic.\nIn 1998, Carnival Corporation bought Cunard. Soon after, the company decided to build a new ocean liner that would make both cruises and Atlantic crossings like \"Queen Elizabeth 2\", but would be bigger. This ship entered service in 2004 and is named RMS \"Queen Mary 2\".\nFleet.\nCunard operates three ships as of 2010, and has operated many more in the past.

For example, water and oil separate in a glass, but adding an emulsifier will help the liquids mix together. Some examples of emulsifiers are egg yolks and mustard. An emulsifier consists of a water-loving hydrophilic head and an oil-loving hydrophobic tail. The hydrophilic head is directed to the aqueous phase and the hydrophobic tail to the oil phase. The emulsifier positions itself at the oil/water or air/water interface and, by reducing the surface tension, has a stabilising effect on the emulsion.\nOperation.\nEmulsifiers belong to the surfactants, usually with a grease-loving (lipophilic) and a water-loving (hydrophilic) part, which can nest around boundary layers between aqueous and greasy parts. Grease and water repel each other, making an emulsion without emulsifier easily fall apart. An emulsifier prevents this rejection because it projects the water-loving side towards the water and the fat-loving side towards the fat. The extent to which the hydrophilic or lipophilic character dominates is represented by the HLB value of the surfactant (HLB = Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance). A high HLB value (10 to 18) indicates a hydrophilic substance suitable for emulsifying fats or oils in water. Substances with a low HLB (3 to 8) are lipophilic and suitable for water-in-oil emulsions.\nEmulgators are used in cosmetics for example in creams and bath oils. A cream consists largely of an emulsion of fat in water or of water in fat, while a bath oil often contains an emulsifier to partially distribute the oil in the water. Without an emulsifier, the oil would float on the water. Examples of emulsifiers used in cosmetic products are glyceryl monostearate, Polysorbate 20, accasia, tragacanth agar, and pectin.\nEmulsifiers are often used in food technology, for example to keep products moist or greasy (such as cakes and bread) or to mix fat-soluble substances with water, such as margarine.\nAn example of an emulsifier in food is lecithin. Lecithin is in egg yolk and is used for example in making mayonnaise. It ensures a good connection between fats and vinegar. In european food, various E-numbers are used in the series from E400 to E499."}

On 2 July 1982 he flew very high in the sky in a homemade aircraft. He called his flying machine \"Inspiration I\". It was made of an ordinary outdoor chair and 43 large balloons full of helium. Walters went up more than 15,000 feet. He went from San Pedro, California into an area near Los Angeles International Airport that was only for airplanes. Many newspapers reported his flight and he became famous.\nBalloon flight.\nOrigin of his plan.\nWalters had always dreamed of flying. He was unable to become a pilot in the United States Air Force because he could not see well enough. Walters had first thought of using weather balloons to fly at age 13. He got the idea when he saw the balloons hanging from the ceiling of a military surplus store. Twenty years later he decided to try it. He planned to attach a few large balloons filled with helium to his lawnchair and then float above his backyard. He planned to stay about 30 feet up in the air for several hours. He had a pellet gun to break some balloons and move back to the ground softly.\nPreparation and launch.\nIn 1982, Walters and his girlfriend, Carol Van Deusen, bought 45 eight-foot weather balloons. They got helium tanks from California Toy Time Balloons. They used a fake letter from his employer, FilmFair Studios. It said the balloons were for a television commercial.\nThey went to the backyard of a home at 1633 W. 7th St. in San Pedro Walters attached the balloons to his lawnchair, filled them with helium. He put on a parachute and used belts to hold himself in the chair. He took his pellet gun, a CB radio, sandwiches, cold beer, and a camera. His friends cut the rope that tied his lawn chair to his Jeep and Walters' lawnchair went up very quickly. Soon, he was 15,000 feet up in the air.\nDuring the flight.\nAt first, he was afraid to shoot any balloons. He thought he might change the way the chair pointed and fall out. He could not control which way he moved. He slowly passed over Long Beach and moved into the space where airplanes came into Long Beach Airport.\nHe used his CB radio to contact people on the ground. Some people made a recording of the conversation. Walters asked them to tell the airport what was happening. He also asked them to tell people he was OK.\nAfter 45 minutes in the sky, he shot several balloons. Then he accidentally dropped his pellet gun. He went down slowly until cables hanging from the balloon got caught in an electrical power line. This caused a blackout in a Long Beach neighborhood for 20 minutes. Walters was able to climb to the ground.\nAfter the flight.\nArrest.\nThe Long Beach Police Department was waiting for him. They arrested him immediately. A reporter asked Larry why he had done it. Walters said, \"A man can't just sit around.\"\nAt first, Walters was fined US$4,000 for breaking U. S. Federal Aviation Regulations. Walters tried to have the fine cancelled. It was reduced to US$1,500.\nFame.\nWalters received the top prize from the Bonehead Club of Dallas for his adventure. He was on television programs such as \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Late Show with David Letterman\". He got a special prize in 1993 at the Darwin Awards.\nThe TV show \"MythBusters\" made a flight like Walters had done. But they used a rope to keep the chair from going too high. One of the show's hosts went up about 30m. He went back down slowly by shooting balloons with a pellet gun.\nLater years.\nLarry gave the lawnchair from the flight to a boy named Jerry because the boy liked him. Later, Walters realized that was a mistake when the Smithsonian Institute asked him to donate it to its museum. Twenty years later, Jerry contacted Mark Barry. Barry is a pilot who wrote about Walters and made a website about his flight. The chair was still sitting in Jerry's garage and had some of the original ropes and water jugs.\nWalters said that he had dreamed about flying this way for twenty years. And, that if he had not tried it, he would have become crazy. He did not think that reaching his goal in life would cause so much excitement or make so many people laugh.\nAfter his flight, he quit his job as a truck driver. He was in a Timex print advertisement in the early '90s, He also gave speeches to help people get more confidence. But, he never made much money from being famous. Walters hiked in the San Gabriel Mountains and did volunteer work for the United States Forest Service. He broke up with his girlfriend after 15 years. He worked as a security guard sometimes.\nIn 1993, Walters shot himself in the heart in Angeles National Forest and died. He was 44 years old.\nOther lawnchair balloonists.\nKent Couch is a gas station owner from Bend, Oregon. He flew 240 miles in his lawn chair on Saturday, 7 July 2007. He landed in a field about 3\u00bd miles NNW of North Powder, Oregon near Idaho. He travelled an average of 22 miles per hour. He tied 105 large helium balloons to his lawn chair. Couch used plastic bags filled with 75 liters water as weight to balance the balloons. Couch had a BB gun to shoot the balloons and start going down on that first flight. He tried again and learned how to let helium out of the balloons and go down more carefully. On 5 July 2008, Couch finally reached his goal. He travelled to another state and landed his lawnchair in western Idaho. The trip was 240 miles and took 9 hours and 12 minutes.\nOn 20 April 2008 a Brazilian Roman Catholic priest Adelir Antonio de Carli flew using a chair and 1000 helium balloons. He did not check the weather forecast and got caught in a storm. He had a GPS but did not know how to use it. He crashed into the sea. The Brazilian navy found his body near an offshore oil platform on 4 July 2008. This unsuccessful flight won him a 2008 Darwin Award.\nMany other people have tried flying with balloons the same way. Some may even have gone higher than Larry did."}

The couple was married on 17 December 1743 at Versailles.\nAfter a few months of a passion that surprised everyone at court, the couple started to drift apart as the young Duchess of Chartres began to lead a scandalous life. \n\u00c9tiennette Le Marquis.\nAfter the death of Louise Henriette on 9 February 1759, Louis Philippe took as his mistress \u00c9tiennette Le Marquis, a former dancer who liked to act in comedy plays, and who introduced him into the world of the theater. Louis Philippe had three children with \u00c9tiennette, they were raised under the care of the Orl\u00e9ans family:\nSecond marriage.\nIn spite of his liaison with \u00c9tiennette, Louis Philippe had several other mistresses until he met, in July 1766, Madame de Montesson, a witty but married twenty-eight year old. After the death of the Marquis of Montesson in 1769, Louis Philippe tried to obtain Louis XV's authorisation to marry the young widow. Finally, in December 1772, the King gave his consent on the condition that the Marquise of Montesson would never become Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans or succeed to any other Orl\u00e9ans titles. In addition, the couple was to live a quiet life away from the court. The morganatic wedding took place on 23 April 1773. \nLater life.\nSurrounded by all the members of his immediate family, even his three children by Etiennette Le Marquis, Louis-Philippe died on 18 November 1785, at Sainte-Assise at the age of sixty. He was buried at the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce convent in Paris, built by his ancestor Anne of Austria to celebrate the birth of Louis XIV of France, Louis Philippe's great grandfather. "}

He actively supported the French Revolution and adopted the name Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9, but was still guillotined during the Reign of Terror. His son Louis Philippe became King of the French after the July Revolution of 1830. He held the rank of prince of the blood. \nBiography.\nLouis Philippe was the son of Louis Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Chartres, and Louise Henriette de Bourbon and was born at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint Cloud. \nDuke of Orl\u00e9ans.\nIn November 1785, upon his father's death, Philippe, the new Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, became the head of the House of Orl\u00e9ans. This was one of the wealthiest families of France, and Premier Prince du Sang, addressed as \"Monsieur le Prince\", the most important person of the kingdom after the king's immediate family. He was next in line to the throne should the main Bourbon line die out.\nMarriage.\nOn 6 June 1769, Louis Philippe married Louise Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Bourbon at the Chapel of the Palace of Versailles. Louise Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde brought to the already wealthy House of Orl\u00e9ans a considerable dowry of six million livres, an annual income of 240,000 livres (later increased to 400,000 livres), as well as lands, titles, residences and furniture. They had five children:\nDuring the first few months of their marriage, the couple appeared devoted to each other, but the duke went back to the life of \"libertinage\" he had led before his marriage. During the summer of 1772, a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter, Philippe began a secret relationship with one of her ladies-in-waiting, St\u00e9phanie F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Ducrest de St-Albin, Countess of Genlis. Stephanie was the niece of Madame de Montesson his fathers second wife.\nMilitary service.\nIn 1778, Philippe served in the squadron of the Count of Orvilliers. He was present in the Battle of Ushant, a naval battle against the British during the American War of Independence on 27 July 1778. He was removed from the navy due in part to the queen's hatred of him and also to his own incompetence and alleged cowardice. As compensation, he was given the honorary post of colonel-general of hussars.\nRevolutionary Politics.\nThe part Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans played during the summer of 1789 is one of the most debated points in the history of the French Revolution. The royal court said he was at the bottom of every popular movement, and saw the \"\"gold of Orl\u00e9ans\" as the cause of the R\u00e9veillon riot and the storming of the Bastille. This was like the subsequent belief held by the Jacobins that everything opposing them relied on the \"gold of Pitt the Younger\"\"). His hatred of Marie Antoinette, his previous disgrace at court, and his liberalism (alongside his friendship with Duport and Choderlos de Laclos), all seem to point towards his involvement. The Duke is also said to have deliberately withheld grain from the people of Paris, being a direct cause of the 5 October \"March on Versailles\". The Duke is also thought to have lied about where he was when the Palace at Versailles was stormed in the early hours of the morning on the 6th of October. He said he was at the General Assembly in Paris, yet several witness (including the Marquise de la Tour du Pin) saw him lead the bloodthirsty mob to a staircase leading to the Queen's bedroom, protected by Swiss Guard. The mob cried \"Long live our King d'Orl\u00e9ans\" during the raid.\nThe Marquis de La Fayette, apparently jealous of Philippe's popularity, persuaded the king to send the duke to Britain on a mission, where he remained in England from October 1789 to July 1790. On 7 July 1790, he took his seat in the National Constituent Assembly. On 2 October, both he and Honor\u00e9 Mirabeau were declared by the Assembly entirely free of any involvement in the events of 5\u20136 October 1789.\n\"Citoyen \u00c9galit\u00e9\".\nPhilippe d'Orl\u00e9ans tried to keep himself distant from the political world, but he was still suspect to the King and subject to pressures from his supporters to replace Louis XVI. His lack of political aspirations could be proven by noting that he did not attempt to obtain any leading position after the King's flight to Varennes in June 1791. In fact, Louis Philippe attempted to reconcile with the King in January 1792, but was rejected, and refused to aid the King any further. In an attempt to show his support of democratic and Enlightenment philosophies, he changed his name to Philippe \"Citoyen Egalit\u00e9\", meaning equality.\nThis is clearly why Philippe now has his head hanging on a wall in the palace in France.\nIn the summer of 1792, he was present for a short time with the Army of the North, together with his two sons, the Duke of Chartres, future King of the French, and the Duke of Montpensier, but had returned to Paris before the insurrection of 10 August.\nDuring the Grand Terror.\nAfter the fall of the monarchy, Philippe risked his own life by saving suspects of the revolutionary regime. At the request of Grace Elliott, he saved the life of Louis Ren\u00e9 Quentin de Richebourg de Champcenetz, the governor of the Tuileries Palace, who was his personal enemy. He accepted the title \"Citoyen \u00c9galit\u00e9\" given to him by the Commune. He was elected 20th and last deputy for Paris to the National Convention, where he again made no notable contribution other than voting in the king's trial. He voted in support of the death sentence for Louis XVI. Many citizens of Paris saw this as an attempt by Philippe to overthrow the crown and take power himself. They believed that not only was the Palais-Royal the center for revolutionary and philosophical debates, but that it was also his ground for recruiting and financing riots and rebellious activity.\nAs a member of the House of Bourbon, Louis Philippe was shortlisted for a trial, and effectively tried and guillotined in the space of one day on 6 November 1793. Accounts of his time in prison and execution mention his exceptional courage.\nPhilippe d'Orl\u00e9ans was buried in the \"Madeleine cemetery\" (closed in 1794), in Paris, where Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and hundreds executed on the \"Place de la R\u00e9volution\" during the Terror had been buried. His remains have never never found."}

He influenced many other writers. He combined satire, black comedy, and science fiction in his writing. Some of his works include \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" (1969), \"Cat's Cradle\" (1963), and \"Breakfast of Champions\" (1973). He was known for his humanist beliefs and was honorary president of the American Humanist Association.\nKurt Vonnegut made a cameo in the \nmovie Back to School starring Rodney \nDangerfield in 1986.\nLife.\nFamily.\nKurt Vonnegut, Jr., was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. His parents were Kurt Vonnegut, Sr., and Edith Lieber. He was the youngest of three children. His ancestors had come to America from Germany in 1855. They were prosperous, originally as brewers and merchants. Both his father and his grandfather attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and were architects in the Indianapolis firm of Vonnegut &amp; Bohn. His great-grandfather was the founder of the Vonnegut Hardware Company, an Indianapolis institution.\nEarly years.\nVonnegut graduated from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in May 1940. He went to Cornell University that autumn. He studied Chemistry, but he was Assistant Managing Editor and Associate Editor of the university newspaper called \"The Cornell Daily Sun\". He was a member of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity just like his father. Vonnegut joined the U.S. Army while he was at Cornell. The Army transferred him to the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee to study Mechanical Engineering. On Mothers' Day in 1944, his mother committed suicide with sleeping pills.\nWorld War II.\nKurt Vonnegut's experience as a soldier and prisoner of war (POW) had a deep and powerful effect on his writing. During the war, he was a soldier with a low rank. He was a private with the 423rd Infantry Regiment, 106th Infantry Division. Vonnegut was captured during the Battle of the Bulge on December 19, 1944. He was in prison in the German city of Dresden. He became a leader among the prisoners because he could speak German a little bit. But, he told German guards \"...just what I was going to do to them when the Russians came\u2026\". The guards beat Vonnegut and stopped him from being a leader. He experienced the fire bombing of Dresden in February 1945 which destroyed most of the city.\nVonnegut's group of American prisoners of war survived the attack. The Germans had kept them in an underground room for storing meat at a slaughterhouse. The Germans called the building \"Schlachthof F\u00fcnf\" (Slaughterhouse Five) and the Allied POWs used that name for their prison. Vonnegut said the result of the attack was complete destruction and death that nobody could understand. This experience gave him ideas for his famous novel, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\". His experience of death and destruction is a central theme in at least six of his other books. In \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" he described the city as looking like the surface of the moon after the bombing. He told about how the Germans making the prisoners work. They had to break into basements and bomb shelters to gather bodies. They had to bury these dead people all together in large holes while German people threw rocks at them and shouted curses. Vonnegut said later, \"There were too many corpses to bury. So instead the Germans sent in troops with flamethrowers. All these civilians' remains were burned to ashes.\"\nVonnegut was freed by Red Army troops in May 1945 at the Saxony-Czechoslovakian border. The U. S. Army gave him a Purple Heart. But he said it was funny because he was not hurt badly at all. He wrote in \"Timequake\" that he was given the award for getting \"frostbite\".\nWork after WWII.\nAfter the war, Vonnegut became an anthropology graduate student at the University of Chicago. He also worked at the City News Bureau of Chicago. Vonnegut admitted that he was a not a good student. One professors said that some of the students were going to be professional anthropologists but he was not one of them. In the book \"Bagombo Snuff Box\", Vonnegut wrote that the university rejected his first thesis. It was about Cubist painters and the leaders of Native American uprisings. The university said it was \"unprofessional.\"\nHe moved from Chicago to Schenectady, New York. He worked in public relations for General Electric. His brother Bernard worked in the research department at the same company. While in Schenectady, Vonnegut lived in a tiny village called Alplaus. Vonnegut rented an upstairs apartment across the street from the Alplaus Volunteer Fire Department. He was an active Volunteer Fire-Fighter for a few years. That apartment still has his desk in it. He wrote many of his short stories at that desk carved his name into the bottom of it. The University of Chicago later accepted his novel \"Cat's Cradle\" as his thesis because they said the story was anthropological. They gave him an M.A. degree in 1971.\nIn the mid 1950s, Vonnegut worked for \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine for a very short time. He was asked to write about a racehorse that had jumped a fence and tried to run away. Vonnegut stared at the blank piece of paper on his typewriter all morning. Then, he typed, \"The horse jumped over the fucking fence,\" and left. He was almost going to quit writing, but the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop asked him to teach. While he was there, \"Cat's Cradle\" became a best-seller, and he began \"Slaughterhouse-Five\". That book is now called one of the best American novels of the 20th century. It is on the 100 best lists of \"Time\" magazine and the Modern Library. In 1961, he published the famous short story Harrison Bergeron.\nVonnegut moved to Barnstable, Massachusetts, a town on Cape Cod. He was the manager of the first Saab dealership in the U.S.\nPersonal life.\nAfter coming home from World War II, Kurt Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox. They had loved each other since they were very young. He wrote about their early relationship in several of his short stories. The couple separated in 1970. He did not divorce Cox until 1979, but from 1970 Vonnegut lived with another woman, the photographer Jill Krementz. She became his second wife after Vonnegut divorced Cox.\nHe raised seven children. Three were from his first marriage to Cox. He adopted one daughter named Lily with Krementz. Three were his sister Alice's children. Vonnegut adopted them after she died of cancer.\nOf Vonnegut's four adopted children, three are his nephews: James, Steven, and Kurt Adams. Vonnegut adopted them after a terrible week in 1958. During that week the children's father James Carmalt Adams was killed in a train crash and their mother died two days later. In his novel \"Slapstick\", Vonnegut told how Alice's husband had died two days before she did. Her family tried to keep her husband's death a secret. However, she found out when another patient gave her a newspaper one day before she died. The three boys had a younger brother named Peter Nice. He was a baby when their parents died. Peter went to live with their father's cousin in Birmingham, Alabama.\nOn January 31, 2001, a fire destroyed the top story of Vonnegut's home. He had smoke inhalation and was in the hospital in critical condition for four days. He survived, but his personal papers were destroyed.\nVonnegut smoked unfiltered Pall Mall cigarettes. He called this habit a \"classy way to commit suicide\".\nVonnegut fell down at his home in Manhattan and injured his brain. He died on April 11, 2007."}

She was sister of Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9, the mother of the executed \"duc d'Enghien\" and aunt of Louis-Philippe King of the French. She was known as \"Citoyenne V\u00e9rit\u00e9\" during the French Revolution. By birth and marriage she held the rank of a princess of the blood.\nYouth.\nDescended from both Louis XIV of France and his younger brother, Philippe of France, \"Duke of Orl\u00e9ans\", Bathilde was born a \"princesse du sang\" and baptised with the names \"Louise Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bathilde\". She was the youngest child of Louis Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. Bathilde was born at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud on 9 July 1750. \nHer mother died in 1759 when Bathilde was just eight years old. Her father, pressured by his mistress, Madame de Montesson, sent her to a convent. During her time at the convent, she became a very spiritual person.\nMarriage.\nInitially, Bathilde was considered as a possible bride for a distant cousin, Ferdinand, Duke of Parma, the favourite grandson of King Louis XV of France, however, that marriage never materialised.\nFinally, in 1770, when she was twenty years old, she was allowed to leave the convent and marry her younger cousin, the \"Louis Henri de Bourbon\", son and heir of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9 and his wife Charlotte \u00c9lisabeth Godefride de Rohan. \nThe scandal of her husband's adultery came out in 1778, and the consequences fell entirely on her shoulders. The couple separated in 1780. As a separated spouse, she was never received at court and was forced to reorganise her life at the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly. \nIn her isolation, she discreetly had an illegitimate daughter with a marine officer. Later, she passed the child off as the daughter of her secretary, in order to keep the little girl close to her. In 1787, she purchased the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace from Louis XVI and had a hamlet constructed there.\nRevolution.\nDuring the French Revolution, just like her brother Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9, Bathilde discovered democracy. She fell out with her royalist husband and son, who both chose to leave France after the storming of the Bastille. As the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" crumbled, she took the name, \"Citoyenne V\u00e9rit\u00e9\", \"Citizeness Truth\". Threatened by the new revolutionary government, she offered her wealth to the First French Republic before it could be confiscated.\nIn April 1793, her nephew, the young Duke of Chartres (future Louis Philippe of the French), fled France and sought asylum with the Austrians. In retribution, the National Convention decreed the imprisonment of all Bourbons remaining in France. While other members of the Orl\u00e9ans family still in France were kept under house arrest, Bathilde, Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9 and his sons were imprisoned in the Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille. Badly rewarded for her fidelity to the democratic ideals of the Revolution, she survived a year and a half in a prison cell. In November of the same year, her brother was guillotined. Miraculously spared during the Reign of Terror, Bathilde was freed during the Thermidorian Reaction and returned to her \u00c9lys\u00e9e residence in Paris. Poverty-stricken, she was forced to rent out most of the palace.\nExile.\nIn 1797, the Directoire decided to exile the last of the Bourbons still living in France. With her sister-in-law, Louise Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Bourbon, she went to Spain with her illegitimate daughter. Despite being forty-seven years old at the time, during the months which this journey took, she had an amorous intrigue with a handsome twenty-seven year old police officer (\"gendarme\") under whose responsibility she had been put. The two maintained a correspondence during her exile.\nRelegated to a place near Barcelona, Bathilde founded, despite her small means, a pharmacy and dispensary for the poor, and her house became a gathering place for those who needed aid. She became completely republican during this time period, despite her exile.\nIn 1804, she learned that Napol\u00e9on I, whom she admired, had had her only son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, kidnapped, and executed by firing squad in the moat of the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes. For ten years, the emperor kept the mother of his most famous victim from setting foot in France. Bathilde got her revenge in 1814, when the people, seeing in her the mother of the \"Martyr of Vincennes,\" cheered her as she travelled the route back to Paris.\nReturn to France.\nIn 1815, at the start of the Bourbon Restoration, she returned to France. Louis XVIII traded with her the H\u00f4tel Matignon for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Bathilde promptly installed a community of nuns on the premises and charged them with praying for the souls of the victims of the Revolution. Her family, in the new moral order of the day, wanted to see her rejoin her husband after a separation of thirty-five years, but she refused. Instead, she resumed her affair with the police officer who had escorted her to Spain in 1797. \nIn 1822, while she was taking part in a march towards the Panth\u00e9on, she lost consciousness, and drew her last breath in the home of a law professor who taught at the Sorbonne. After her death, her nephew, Louis-Philippe, wanting to give an air of respectability to her bohemian lifestyle, burned the manuscript of her memoirs and a file on her young police officer located in the war archives. \nShe was buried in the Orl\u00e9ans family chapel the Coll\u00e9giale de Dreux.

It is often below sea level.\nGeological basins are one of the two most common places inland which collect sediment (the other is lakes). The type of rocks which form there tell about the palaeoclimate of the continent. The geology is of interest to oil prospectors, hydrologists and palaeontologists.\nCauses.\nDeath Valley example.\nStarting around 16 million years ago in the Miocene, and continuing into the present, a large part of the North American Plate has been stretched by being pulled apart.p611 The result has been the creation of a large and still-growing region of relatively thin crust; the region grew an average of per year initially and then slowed to per year in the last 5 million years. Geologists call this region the Basin and Range Province.\nPulling forces causes rock at depth to stretch like silly putty and rock closer to the surface to break along normal faults into downfallen basins called grabens.\nSediment.\nBecause the basin is low-lying, it collects sediment. Rivers may run down into the basin from surrounding mountains. Floods or lakes may form with no outlet to the sea. Evaporation occurs; more sediment arrives, and so on. The strata which forms gives clues as to the palaeoclimate.\nOther terms that are used to describe a basin are: \"drainage basin\", \"catchment\", \"catchment area\", \"catchment basin\", \"drainage area\", \"river basin\", \"water basin\", \"endorheic basin\" and \"watershed\".\nDrainage.\nSome basins, such as the Great Basin, do not drain to the sea. The water may drain into underground aquifers, or evaporate to form salt lakes.\nMost basins, however, are drainage basins with rivers bringing their water into the sea. Many such rivers meander through a web of islands at the river delta, and bring along a huge amount of sediment in the form of mud, clay and sand. The Amazon and the Mississippi river systems are like this. The strata which form are quite different from inland basin lakes."}

The kinetic energy levels of the Auger electrons depend on the type of the atoms from which the electrons were ejected, and the chemical environment of the atoms.

The costume was made up of a coat which went down to the ankles and a mask. The mask looked like a bird's beak. The beak was often filled with things which smelled sweet or strong (often lavender). Along with this, gloves, boots, a hat and something else to go over the jacket was worn.\nDescription.\nThe beak was held in front of the doctor's nose by straps. There were two holes in the mask, filled with glass at eye level, so that the doctor could see properly. The mask had two smaller holes for the doctor to breathe. It was a type of respirator which was often filled with strong, nice smelling things. Dried flowers (such as roses and carnations), herbs (such as mint), spices, camphor or a vinegar sponge could all be placed in the beak. The mask was supposed to keep away bad smells. At that time, it was thought that bad smells caused infection. Doctors believed the herbs would take away the \"evil\" smells of the plague and stop them from getting it.\nThe costume had a wide brimmed leather hood to show that they were doctors. They used wooden canes to point out areas needing medical attention. This was also used to look at patients without touching them. The canes were also used to keep people away, to take clothes off plague victims without having to touch them and to take a patient's pulse.\nWearing these clothes actually helped make sure that the doctors were not infected by fleas or rats. Fleas could not bite through the leather jacket and infected people could not touch the doctor, which was also because of his leather jacket.\nHistory.\nSome modern writers have said that fourteenth-century plague doctors wore masks which looked like birds. However, medical historians say that the plague doctor costume was invented by Charles de Lorme. In 1619 he used the idea of full head-to-toe protective clothing. It was modelled after a soldier's armour. This was made up of a bird-like mask and a long leather (Moroccan or Levantine) or waxed-canvas gown. The gown went from the neck to the ankles. The clothing which went on top of the gown, as well as leggings, gloves, boots and a hat, were made of waxed leather. The garment was impregnated with similar fragrant items as the beak mask.\nThis poem was written in the seventeenth century. It describes the plague doctor's costume.\nJean-Jacques Manget, in his 1721 book \"Treatise on the Plague\", written just after the Great Plague of Marseille, talks about the costumes that plague doctors wore at Nijmegen in 1636-1637. A picture of the costume is at the front of the book. The plague doctors of Nijmegen also wore beaked masks. Their robes, leggings, hats, and gloves were made of morocco leather.\nThis costume was also worn by plague doctors during the Plague of 1656. This plague killed 145,000 people in Rome and 300,000 in Naples. The costume made people very scared because it was a sign that they would die soon.\nCulture.\nThe costume was worn by a \"commedia dell'arte\" character called \"Il Medico della Peste\" (the Plague Doctor).

Released into the arcades in 1995, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PC conversions followed. The game was included in \"Taito Legends 2\", but the US arcade version was included on US PS2 version instead. The game is a spin-off from \"Bubble Bobble\".\nThe game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a \"Monsta\" and a \"Mighta\".\nSome versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other.\nCompletion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.\nBust-A-Move 2X.\nTaito later repacked \"Bust-A-Move 2\" with an optional alternative set of levels and some new attract mode animations (including holiday-themed ones) as \"Bust-A-Move 2X\" (Also known as \"Puzzle Bobble 2X\").\nPorts of \"Bust-A-Move 2\" to the PC and Sega Saturn are of \"Bust-A-Move 2X\" and additionally include a level editor/designer. A port of 2X was made to the PlayStation but was not released until some time after a port of \"Bust-A-Move 2\" was released; therefore, it is not so well known.\nCover art.\nThis game has become notorious for one version of its cover art. The original US version of the Saturn edition featured a picture of several large balls with screaming, blue, human faces with white sticks forcing their eyes open. This cover earned it a place on Gamespy.com's Top Ten Worst Covers list. "}

They are bosons, which means that they have a spin of 0 or 1. Both had been found in experiments by the year 1983. Together, they are responsible for a force known as \"weak force.\" Weak force is called weak because it is not as strong as the strong force. There are two W bosons with different charges, the normal W+, and its antiparticle, the W \u2013. Z bosons are their own antiparticle.\nNaming.\nW bosons are named after the weak force that they are responsible for. Weak force is what physicists believe is responsible for the breaking down of some radioactive elements, in the form of Beta decay. In the late '70s, scientists managed to combine early versions of the weak force with electromagnetism, and called it the electroweak force.\nCreation of W and Z bosons.\nW and Z bosons are only known to be created under Beta decay, which is a form of radioactive decay.\nBeta Decay.\nBeta decay occurs when there are a lot of neutrons in an atom. An easy way to think of a neutron is that it is made of one proton and one electron. When there are too many neutrons in one atom nucleus, one neutron will split and form a proton and an electron. The proton will stay where it is, and the electron will be launched out of the atom at incredible speed. This is why Beta radiation is harmful to humans.\nWeak force is believed to be able to change the flavour of a quark. For example, when it changes a down quark in a neutron into an up quark, the charge of the neutron becomes +1, since it would have the same arrangement of quarks as a proton. The three-quark neutron with a charge of +1 is no longer a neutron after this, as it fulfills all of the requirements to be a proton. Therefore, Beta decay will cause a neutron to become a proton (along with some other end-products).\nW boson decay.\nWhen a quark changes flavour, as it does in Beta decay, it releases a W boson. On average, W bosons only last for 3x10-25 seconds before themselves decaying into other particles, which is why we had not discovered them until less than half a century ago. Surprisingly, W bosons have a mass of about 80 times that of a proton. Keep in mind that the neutron that it came from has almost the same weight as the proton. In the quantum world, it is not uncommon for a more massive particle to come from a less massive particle; the extra mass comes from stored energy via Einstein's famous formula, formula_1. After the 3x10-25 seconds has passed, a W boson decays into one electron and one neutrino. Since neutrinos rarely interact with matter, we can ignore them from now on. The electron is propelled out of the atom at a high speed. The proton that was produced by the Beta decay stays in the atom nucleus, and raises the atomic number by one.\nZ boson decay.\nZ bosons are also predicted in the Standard Model of physics, which successfully predicted the existence of W bosons. Z Bosons decay into a fermion and its antiparticle, which are particles such as electrons and quarks which have spin in units of half of the reduced planks constant."}

If it is very bad, they might have to go to the intensive care unit so that doctors can make sure that they are getting good care. If the reason that they have toxic shock syndrome is because of tampon use, doctors will make sure that they take the tampon out. If the reason that they have toxic shock syndrome is an injury (an abscess or other infection), the injury has to be drained.\nAntibiotics like cephalosporin, penicillin, and vancomycin are used to stop the bacteria from growing.

At the age of 4 he moves to Geneva (Switzerland) where he spends most of his childhood. Music is then everything to him, and he discovers reggae at the age of 15, when he spends one year in Jamaica at IONA High School, hosted in a Jamaican family, having obtained a scholarship from the American Field Service. Later on, after passing his international baccalaureate, he studies sound techniques at the School of Recording Arts, Canada and at the Sound and Audio Engineering School in Geneva, Switzerland.\nHe starts to be interested in Reggae music very early, and at the age of 15, he composes his first song. His musical studies in Canada, long stays in Jamaica, and time spent living in France near the Swiss border form the cultural triumvirate from which Charly B draws his artistic vision. He has been singing with legends of dancehall like Capleton, Kiprich, De Marco and Anthony B.\nCareer.\nIn 2002, at the age of 21, he wins the first prize for the best Geneva (Switzerland) Singjay In 2003, he writes a song for the movie Destination Jamaica by George Tait (Jungle George) In 2004, his song \"My Queen\" appears in the DVD sold with the Austrian surfers' magazine Methodmag, published in 60,000 copies. In 2005 he wins the 1st prize for best Singjay in Switzerland organized by Giddeon Productions Unfortunately, he cannot take advantage of the prize (concert on the main stage of Rototom Sunsplash Festival 2005) in Italy, as he is expected in Jamaica that summer, and therefore gives his prize to the number 2 in the competition, Elijah. In 2007, Eliane Dambre from the Ateliers du Funambule sponsored by Michel Fugain, which studios are based in Nyon, decides to present his candidacy to the Eurovision for Switzerland, against DJ Bobo to represent Switzerland, but his candidacy is too late to be retained. More recently, in 2009, he has won the price for the best reggae song at the competition organized by Reggae Europe. He has deposited to SACEM over 100 titles entirely composed by him (music and lyrics), in French, English and Jamaican patois.\nEncounter with Jon Baker.\nIn summer 2009, he makes what he calls \"a crucial encounter\" with the producer Jon Baker, and records at Geejam Studios his album Forever, which will be released in 2011 under the label Geejam Recordings/ Forward Recordings. This encounter with Jon Baker is very important for the artist; the British producer (a friend of Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records), has discovered many talents, among which recently the reggae singer Alborosie and The Jolly Boys. Moreover, he gains the confidence of Reggae Europe who partners with Geejam Recordings for the album Forever.\nStart of tours and international invitations.\nAt the end of 2009, he is invited in Germany (Leipzig) to meet with Pionear from Germaican records then invited by Stylordz in Toronto and New York for the anniversary of Zulu Nation. In Toronto he shoots the clip of the song \"Ooh No\". In 2010, invited by the CAMA Festival in Hano\u00ef, Vietnam, he makes a Vietnam tour (Hano\u00ef and Ho Chi Minh City) and upon his return, attends the ROTOTOM Sunsplash Festival in August 2010.

It takes place on February 3 or 4 and there are a lot of ways to celebrate the day. People take part in a traditional \"mame-maki\" ceremony. People throw roasted soybeans (\"mame\") and shout \u2018\u2018\"Oni wa Soto Fuku wa Uti\"\u2019\u2019(Get out Ogre! Come in Happiness!). After the ceremony, each person eats the number of beans of their year of age in order to get happiness in the coming year. Another traditional custom is putting a head of a sardine and \"hiiragi\" on the door to get rid of \"Oni\" (ogre). In addition, people living in the \"Kansai\" area eat \"Nori Maki\" (a special \"sushi\" roll) while facing the \u2018\u2019lucky direction\u2019\u2019 and not saying a word .\nOrigin.\nSetsubun means \u201cdivision of the seasons\u201d in the literal sense. In ancient times the beginning of each season was called Setsubun. On the Setsubun day, various rituals were conducted to drive away devil\u2019s sprits. Nowadays, however, Setsubun only refers to \"Risshun\" (beginning of spring) because the day is the most important than the other Setsubun day since the day is a new year\u2019s day in lunar calendar.It is said that both of beans and rice have spiritual power in it, and to throw these things is a good way to drive demons from our own and our house. People used to throw rice in ancient time, but people started to throw beans instead of rice since Chinese folkway was introduced. Since then, people throw beans to drive demons on Setsubun day.\nAs we said above, people usually eat an \"Ehomaki\", which is a kind of \"makizushi\", on Setsubun. \"Makizushi\" means \u201ccall over happiness\u201d. It is usually eaten without being cut because if it is cut, it implies \u201cbreak up\u201d. People usually put 7 kinds of ingredients in it after the Seven Gods of Fortune. \nIt is eaten without saying anything. Generally, it\u2019s because it would be rude to the Seven Gods of Fortune if people are talking while it is eaten, but anyone doesn\u2019t know the fact.\nHistory.\n\"Setsubun\" means separating seasons, and indicated each day before the first day of spring, summer, autumn and winter.\nHowever, the event \"Setsubun\" is very famous, so it became the word to indicate the day before the first day of spring\nonly.\nSetsubun was a ceremony to drive off ancient China and gods who brought misfortune. Originally, it was the folk event \nto hope talisman and good crop of private sector. This ceremony came down to Japan in the \"Nara\" era. \nIn the \"Hiean\" era, \"Tsuina\" that the event of New Year's Eve held in the palace, changed into the ceremony to drive demons.\nIt died out in the \"Muromachi\" era, but the event gradually spread among commoner and remained as \"Mamemaki\" of Setsubun.\nIn the evening of Setsubun, people set up branches of holly with sardine at the entrance of house, and scatter parched beans. \nHowever, nowadays households which adorn with them decreased, and only scatter parched beans.\nIn the meantime, \"Ehomaki\" started as a custom to pray for the prosperous business at the harbor of \"Osaka\" in the end of \"Edo\" era. The custom died out temporarily, but \"Osaka Nori Kyodo Kumiai\" revived it in the event of \"Dotonbori\" in the late 1970's. Therefore, it was famous in the \"Kansai\" district. Also, it began to sell in the part of supermarkets and convenience stores in 1990's. In addition, it became rapidly popular among the whole country because \"Ehomaki\" was advertised considerably in stores.\nRelated events.\nThere many events related to Setsubun in big shrines. For example, \"Narita-san Shinsho-ji\" in \"Chiba\" holds big events every year. Some believers of \"Toshi-otoko\" (a man who was born in a year with the same sign of the Chinese Zodiac as the current year.) or big names are invited to the event and they perform \"mame-maki\" ceremony to gather people. Because of the bad economy in Japan, these events are crowed with a lot of people who try to call in happiness."}

It is on several islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands. The park is in the area between the East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara provinces. The park includes three larger islands: Komodo, Padar and Rincah. It also includes 26 smaller ones for a total area of 1,733\u00a0km\u00b2 (603\u00a0km\u00b2 of it land). The national park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon. This animal is the world's largest lizard. Later it began protecting other species, including some in the ocean. In 1991 the national park was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nGeography and climate.\nThe park is spread over several islands. It includes part of western coast of Flores, the three larger islands of Komodo, Padar, Rincah, and 26 smaller islands. It also includes ocean areas such as the Sape Straights. The islands of the national park are volcanic. The land is generally rugged, with some rounded hills to 735m. The climate is one of the driest of Indonesia. Each year between 800mm and 1000mm of rain falls in the park area. Temperatures in the dry season from May to October are around 40\u00a0\u00b0C.\nPlants and animals.\nThe Park is hot and dry. There are many savannah plants that make it a good place for the Komodo dragon.\nCloud forests are in only a few areas above 500 metres. These forests are good places for some local plants. There are mangrove forests in some of the quiet bays of the three larger islands.\nLarge and complex coral reefs are along the north-east coast of Komodo. The park has many animals that live in the ocean, including whale sharks, ocean sunfish, manta rays, eagle rays, pygmy seahorse, false pipefish, clown frogfish, nudibranchs, blue-ringed octopus, sponges, tunicates, and coral.\nConservation.\nThe island of Padar and part of Rinca were made nature reserves in 1938. Komodo Island became a nature reserve in 1965. UNESCO also began to protect the island in 1977. The three islands were named a national park in 1980. The park was extended to include the nearby parts of the ocean and a part of Flores in 1984. In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since 1995, the national park authority has been supported by an American environmental organization called The Nature Conservancy (TNC).\nKomodo National Park has been selected as one of 28 finalists to become one of the New7Wonders of Nature.\nPeople living in the park and tourism.\nAbout 4,000 people live within the park. Scuba diving is popular because of the many different kinds of life living in the water. Ecotourism in the ocean is the main way to get money to support the park\nHowever, several fishermen died since the 1980s. People disagree about what happened to them. Park patrol and military said they needed to protect themselves. Fishermen living in the area say the park management killed the fishermen on purpose."}

In all of the dishes, Hoto was economical because it used many vegetables and stock. Also, its taste was good. Therefore, Hoto spread throughout Yamanashi.\nHow to cook.\nFirst, knead flour with a little water in a bowl. Then spread the dough with a stick. Fold the dough and cut widely. You do not need to let it sit, or add salt. Nowadays, you can buy Hoto noodles around Yamanashi prefecture. The soup tastes like soybean paste. Adding pumpkin paste into the soup is popular.

In winter, pumpkins, taro, carrots, napa cabbage and so on are used. Sometimes pork or chicken are used."}
{"id": "275188", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275188", "title": "Pion", "text": "A pion or \u03c0 meson is a meson, which is a subatomic particle made of one quark and one antiquark.\nThere are six types of quark (called \"flavours\") but only two \"flavours\" go together to make a pion. These flavours are called up and down. Quarks have charge, so two quarks of the same flavour (both up or both down) make a neutral pion. But when the two quarks have different flavours (up and down), the pion will have a charge. This charge is positive when an up quark pairs with a down antiquark. The charge is negative when a down quark pairs with an up antiquark.\nPions do not exist for a long time. (On average, charged pions exist for around 26 nanoseconds; neutral pions last a tiny fraction of this). Pions are significant to our lives because they are one of the ways for strong force interactions to take place between nucleons like the protons and neutrons of ordinary matter. These interactions hold the nucleus together.\nPions are the lightest hadrons (particles made up of quarks) and pions with a positive or negative charge are the mesons with the longest \"mean lifetime\" (the average time that passes before they \"decay\" into leptons).\nThree Types of Pions.\nThe three types of pion have the Greek letter pi in their symbols: \nThe (superscript) +, \u2013, or 0 simply refers to the (electromagnetic) charge of the pion.\nUp quarks have a charge of + and down antiquarks have a charge of +, so \u03c0+ has charge of +1 (like a proton).\nAntiparticles have charge opposite to their particles, so up antiquarks have a charge of \u2212 and down quarks have a charge of \u2212. This means that \u03c0\u2212 has charge of \u22121 (like an electron).\nBecause \u03c00 pairs quarks of the same flavour with their antiquarks, both up quark (+) paired with up antiquark (\u2212) and down quark (+) paired with down antiquark (\u2212) leave it with zero charge (like a neutron).\nQuarks and antiquarks also have a different kind of charge called \"color\", unrelated to electromagnetic charge. This comes from the strong interaction that holds the quarks together. As in all mesons, the color charges in a pion must be equal and opposite: \"blue\" with \"anti-blue\", \"green\" with \"anti-green\", or \"red\" with \"anti-red\". The effect of these color\u2013anticolor pairings is that the pion's color charge is \"colorless\" (like a neutron is neutral). At the smallest distances, typically within an atomic nucleus, a small effect of the color charge remains and acts as the nuclear force that holds the nucleus together. Within the nucleus, then, \"virtual\" pions (and other \"virtual\" mesons) are exchanged between nucleons (protons and neutrons), pulling them together.\nAntiquarks are antimatter, so they will annihilate a quark of the same \"flavour\" that is near enough. This means that the quark and the antiquark will turn one another into energy.\nForce Carriers.\nForce-carriers are particles that are responsible for the action of forces, such as electromagnetism. Just as photons are responsible for electromagnetic force, so mesons are responsible for some of the lower energy (\"residual\") strong force interactions that occur between nucleons. (Strong force is also known as nuclear force or \"residual strong force\" when its action is between nucleons.) At an even smaller level, gluons are responsible for the strong force interactions between quarks.\nPion Decay.\nDecay of charged pions always produces leptons, like electrons. \nA neutral pion, \u03c00, will usually decay into two highly energized photons.\nOther Forms of Pion Decay.\nHowever, there is some probability (from &lt;0.1% to 1.2%) involved with the decay of some pions, as they can also decay into different forms. For \u03c0+, the second most likely decay product is one positron (an anti-electron) and one electron neutrino. \u03c0\u2013 will sometimes decay into one electron and one electron antineutrino. \u03c00 will sometimes decay into one highly energized photon, one electron, and one positron. (Keep in mind that positrons and electrons can annihilate each other, and this annihilation produces highly energized photons).\nDecay Due to Weak Force.\nSince the decay of pions is due to weak force, yet another force carrier is introduced. During the decay, a W+ boson is created, which lasts for 3x10\u221225 seconds. After this incredibly short amount of time, the W+ boson will decay into the leptons that the pion would naturally decay to. However, it is important to draw this distinction, as it includes weak force."}

Although it is no longer a formal term in taxonomy, it is still useful as an evolutionary grade, a kind of catch-all term. \"Labyrinth\" mean a maze and \"dont\" means tooth.\nLabyrinthodonts are often called Temnospondyls.\nThe Labyrinthodontia is not a clade, because it is not monophyletic. It has been replaced in the classification by more correct terms.\nThe labyrithodonts were some of the dominant animals from the Devonian to the Lower Triassic (about 390 to 210 million years ago). The group is an evolutionary grade (a polyphyletic or paraphyletic group) of species which look rather similar.\nThe name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentine and enamel of the teeth, which often fossilise. They are also have a heavily armoured skull roof (so they also have an even older name \"Stegocephalia\"), and complex vertebrae.\nCharacteristics.\nThe labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. Although there was much variation, these traits make their fossils distinct and easy to recognise:\nFishapods.\nEarly tetropods are now classified as lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii). This is because we now know they were aquatic when the limbs first evolved (see Tetrapod).\nThe informal term \"fishapods\" is often used for this group of Devonian animals.\nA more formal term, used by Clack, is \"stem-group tetrapods\"."}

This means that they are believed to be so small that they can not be divided any more. Tau leptons can be thought of as very heavy electrons, as they are both leptons. This is because they have about 3,500 times as much mass as electrons, and about 17 times as much mass as muons. Since they only live for 2.9x10\u201313 seconds, they do not have a significant role in the regular world. However, they are very important in the decay of subatomic matter.\nLike the other two basic leptons, tauons have a neutrino named after them (the tau neutrino).\nTau have a charge of -1, and can be written as \u03c4\u2013. Since antimatter has the opposite of charge of regular matter, anti-tauons have a charge of +1, and can be written as \u03c4+. Tauons themselves are unstable, and can decay. Also, \u03c4+ and \u03c4\u2013 can annihilate each other in a form of decay. When a single tauon decays, it is the only lepton that can decay into hadrons (things made of quarks). \u03c4+ and \u03c4\u2013 can be formed by an electron-positron (antielectron) pair combining. The two tauons then decay into an electron and a positron or a muon and an antimuon, and four of the various neutrinos. However, a single tauon decays differently than a tauon and an antitauon.\nA \u03c4\u2013 will quickly decay into a tau neutrino and a W boson. The W boson will exist for 3x10\u201325 seconds, before it decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino, a muon and a muon antineutrino, or a down quark and an up antiquark."}

What makes kaons unique is that they are made of one up quark or down quark, and one strange quark. (One of the two quarks that make of a kaon must be an antiquark, and the other must be normal matter. For example, a kaon can be made of one up quark and a strange antiquark). The discovery of kaons was significant because it proved the existence of yet another flavour (type) of quark, the strange quark.\nThere are four types of kaons, but two of them are relatively easy to understand. There is the K+ and the K0. The + and 0 above the letter K refer to whether the charge is positive, or 0 (neutral). The K+ is made of one up quark, and one strange antiquark. Since antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart (and since normal strange quarks have a charge of -1/3), 2/3 + 1/3 = a +1 charge, or simply a + charge. (Also because antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart, if you change the up quark in a K+ to an up antiquark and the strange antiquark to a normal strange quark, you get the opposite charge, forming a K\u2013). Since down quarks and strange quarks have the same charge, if either one of them is an antiparticle, the overall charge is zero. Therefore, a K0 can either be made of one down quark and strange antiquark, or one down antiquark and one normal strange quark."}

He was an author who wrote about images in media. He thought that violent imagery in mass media and comic books was harmful to children. His best-known book was \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954). After this book became popular, the United States Congress took a close look at the comic book industry. Also, the Comics Code was made in response. He called television \"a school for violence\".\nBiography.\nHe was born on 20 March 20 1895 in Munich. He studied medicine in Germany and England. He and Sigmund Freud wrote letters to each other, and Wertham chose to study mainly psychiatry. In 1922 he was asked to come to the United States and to join the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He became a United States citizen in 1927. He moved to New York City in 1932. He became the director of a psychiatric clinic connected with the New York Court of General Sessions. All people who were convicted of serious crimes had a psychiatric examination there. The report from those examinations were used in court. In 1935 Wertham spoke in court for the defense in the trial of Albert Fish, a serial killer. Wertham said Fish was insane.\n\"Seduction of the Innocent\".\nIn \"Seduction of the Innocent\", Wertham wrote about clear or hidden violence, sex, drug use, and other adult topics in \"crime comics\". Wertham used the words \"crime comics\" to mean popular comics about criminals and murder that were popular at that time. But, he also included superhero and horror comics in the same group of comics. He said that reading violent comics made children violent. However, this idea was from stories he had heard, not careful research.\nComics, especially the crime and horror titles started by EC Comics had many shocking or ugly images. Wertham often reproduced these pictures. He pointed out themes about death such as \"injury to the eye\" that he thought were common. One example Jack Cole's \"Murder, Morphine and Me\" in Magazine Village's \"True Crime Comics\" Vol. 1, #2 (May 1947). The story showed a character named Mary Kennedy who was a drug dealer. In her dream, she was almost stabbed in the eye with a needle by a drug addict.). Many of his other ideas seemed like nonsense to the comics industry. Wertham thought he saw hidden sexual themes in comics such as nude women hidden in drawings of muscles and tree bark. He also thought Batman and Robin were gay partners. Wertham's idea that Wonder Woman had a hidden story of bondage did have some facts to support it. Her creator William Moulton Marston had said the same thing. However, Wertham also claimed that Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian.\nWertham's book had many problems. He did not clearly record information with citations or a bibliography. There was no way of knowing if the stories in his book were true. In 2012, Carol Tilley, a professor of library and information science, found that Wertham was not honest in \"Seduction\". He changed many facts such as making children in the book younger than they really were.\nLater career.\nWertham's views on mass media have largely overshadowed his broader concerns with violence and with protecting children from psychological harm. His writings about the effects of racial segregation were evidence in the important Supreme Court case \"Brown v. Board of Education\". Part of his 1966 book, \"A Sign for Cain\", was about medical professionals and their actions in the Holocaust. He talked about the book on a popular TV program. Parts of these programs were shown at the 2003 Comic-Con International: San Diego\nBeaty writes that in 1959 Wertham tried to sell an another book to follow \"Seduction of the Innocent\". It was called \"The War on Children\". The book was about the effect of television on children. Wertham was unhappy that no companies wanted to publish it.\nWertham always said he did not want censorship of comics. In the 1970s he was more interested in the good side of comics fan groups. In his last book, \"The World of Fanzines\" (1974), he concluded that fanzines were a good way to be creative. Wertham was asked to speak to the New York Comic Art Convention. Most comics fans still had bad opinions about him. They did not trust him and yelled at him during his speech. He soon stopped writing about comics.\nBefore he retired, Wertham had several jobs. He became a professor of psychiatry at New York University. He was a senior psychiatrist in the New York City Department of Hospitals and a psychiatrist and the director of the Mental Hygiene Clinic at the Bellevue Hospital Center.\nHe died on November 18, 1981 at his retirement home in Kempton, Pennsylvania. He was 86 years old.\nAfter his death.\nThe Library of Congress keeps his papers. People were able to study them starting May 20, 2010. The library has a list of all of his writing. This list shows Wertham's many different interests."}

He was notable for his work on fossil animals of North America. Cope was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nCope was a paleontologist, comparative anatomist, herpetologist and ichthyologist. He wrote many papers. His parents were rich Quakers.\nHis father wanted him to be a farmer, but he became a scientist. He married his cousin. Later, they owned a museum in Philadelphia.\nMostly, he read books on his own to learn science and found things out himself. He was not a teacher. He did field work, and wrote a lot. In the 1870s and 1880s, went to the American West to report what the land was like to the government. He was often on a mapping team sent by the United States Geological Survey.\nFor a while he and Othniel Charles Marsh were competing to find dinosaurs. This fight between them is called the Bone Wars. Sometimes being a scientist cost him more money than he could afford. In the 1880s, Cope lost so much money in his silver mines that he had to sell a lot of his fossil collection in 1886. In the 1890s he was no longer poor, but he died when he was only 57.\n1,400 of his articles were published in science journals. He found over 1,000 species of extinct animals. He wrote about hundreds of kinds of ancient fish. He found dozens of dinosaurs. He wrote about the evolution of mammalian molars teeth, and produced two huge works on the amphibia and reptiles of North America.\nCope showed that horses evolved to be larger as they moved from woodland onto grassland. The fact that the fossils show the mammals getting bigger over time is called Cope's rule.\nEarly life.\nCope was the first son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. His father was a serious Quaker and ran the shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope. The business was started in 1821. His parents took him to gardens, museums, and zoos. They taught him to read and write and draw.\nHe started going to school when he was 9 years old. When he was 12, his parents sent him away to a Quaker boarding school. At 15 years old he studied biology (natural history) and often visited the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. They had a Natural history museum.\nHis letters home show he felt farm work was not for him.p15 Cope\u2019s father made him get a summer job on a farm when he was 14 and 15. When he was 16 he was not sent to the boarding school any more because his father wanted him to be a farmer.p100 His father wanted him to get more exercise, so he bought him a farm. Cope rented out the land to farmers and worked on farms.\nWhen he was 18 years old he, began working at the Academy of Natural Sciences part-time. He took classes. His father paid for them. Still, his father said he should farm. Until he was 23, his letters to his father kept saying he did not want to be a farmer and that he wanted to be a scientist.p100\nHe worked at the Academy of Natural Sciences for two years, and became a member.p21 He sometimes had to visit the Smithsonian Institution where he met Spencer Baird, who knew all about fish and birds.p107 He also joined the American Philosophical Society. The Academy and the Society published journals, and they accepted his articles.\nIn 1861 when he was 21 years old, he wrote about classifying salamanders. A salamander is an amphibian.p835 He then took a comparative anatomy class from a famous teacher at the University of Pennsylvania. Cope then asked his father if he could learn German and French so he could read science books and novels in German and French.p101\nEuropean travels.\nAt the beginning of the American Civil War Cope tried to get a job helping in a field hospital. Then, when he was 22, he wanted to somehow help out the freed blacks. That year, 1863, he and his fianc\u00e9e broke up and he was sad. He went to Ireland, England and Europe. During his trip, he met famous scientists.p26-30\nWhile in Germany, he first met his rival, scientist Othniel Charles Marsh.p11 On February 11, 1864, he wrote to his father, \u201cI shall get home in time to . . . be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this . . . certain persons . . . would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war\".p138\nEarly career.\nCope\u2019s return home to Philadelphia was before the end of the Civil War. He married a Quaker girl he knew, Annie Pim. She lived on a farm and the wedding was held at her house.\nCope wrote papers on fish, whales, and one on a fossil frog with a tail.p835 Cope\u2019s father gave money to a small Quaker college called Haverford College. The college gave Cope an honorary master's degree and hired him to teach Zoology.p48\nCope went on scientific trips to the American west and wrote letters to his parents and to his wife and daughter while on those trips. He told his father that teaching took up too much of his time for him to make scientific discoveries.p143/6 He quit his job at the college. He and his wife and daughter then moved to Haddonfield to be closer to the fossil beds in western New Jersey.\nIn Haddonfield, New Jersey were marlpits, where a dinosaur skeleton was discovered in 1858 by William Foulke and named \"Hadrosaurus foulkii\" by Dr. Leidy of Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences.p151/8 Cope found more fossils in the marlpits there. For example, he described \"Elasmosaurus platyurus\" and \"Laelaps\" in 1868. Edward Cope also went on expeditions to caves; the last cave he visited was the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana in 1871.p151/5\nIn his 30s the Quaker wrote a lot of scientific papers that were published. Charles Sternberg said that in the fossil fields of Kansas Cope had a \"severe attack of nightmare . . . every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night . . . sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber\".p167\nCope also looked for fossils in the west of the United States. In 1872 he explored Eocene rocks. The rocks were 55 to 38 million years old. That year, he worked too much and had a breakdown.p583 In 1873 he studied the \"Titanothere\" beds (strata) of northeastern Colorado. \"Titanothere\" was a large extinct herbivore.p183/194\nThe Wheeler Survey.\nIn 1874 Cope volunteered for the Wheeler Survey. These geological mapping trips were led by George Montague Wheeler. They mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th meridian.p200 The 100th meridian west is the boundary between the dry West and the rainy East of the United States.\nIn 1874 Cope discovered the Puerco formation in New Mexico during the Wheeler Survey.p200 The Puerco formation was a layer of soft rock 500\u00a0feet thick along the upper Puerco River near Cuba, New Mexico. It was green and black marl (that contained chemicals used in making fertilizer). Fossils were later found by someone at a similar formation west of there in a different county. Cope said it was like those fossils came from his Puerco formation, which he discovered. His cliff may have been dug by the river over a long time and it looked like it had been there a long time. It was something the scientists he knew had not seen before him. As part of the Wheeler Survey, he was able to shop at commissaries. He was able to get his finding in the reports the survey published. He brought his wife and daughter along on one trip of the survey, renting a house for them. As a volunteer, he paid his own way.p63\nIndependence.\nWhen Cope was 35, his father died, leaving him a quarter of a million dollars.p837 The next year, 1876, Cope moved his wife and daughter from their house by the apple orchard in Haddonfield, New Jersey back to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \u2013 this time to a row house in the City. He bought two units and used the one next door as a paleo-lab for his fossil collection. He stopped doing field work to catch up on his writing. He hired teams to look for fossils for him. And, he helped the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition set up their fossil displays.p218 In 1877 he was able to buy half of the \"American Naturalist.\"\nHe published papers so fast his rival, Professor Marsh, had doubts about when Cope\u2019s fossils were found. In August 1878 when he was 38, Cope sailed to the British Isles to attend a scientific convention in Dublin Ireland. He then sailed to France to go to a two-day scientific convention there. At one of the conventions he decided to buy some boxes of Argentine fossils, maybe for the museum in Philadelphia.\nWhen Cope came back, two years-worth of collecting by his man Lucas awaited him. This included a \"Camarasaurus\", a sauropod.p42\nThe bone wars.\nCope introduced his (then) friend Marsh to the marl pit owner, Albert Vorhees, when the two visited the site. Later he discovered that Marsh had gone\u2014behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven.p35\nIn 1868 Professor Marsh said Cope put the skull of dinosaur at the tail end. It was \"Elasmosaurus\", a long-necked plesiosaur. It turned out Marsh was right, and Cope was humiliated.\nThe feud lasted for the rest of Cope\u2019s life. Both became less wealthy trying to keep the other\u2019s men from digging for fossils. Each criticized the other\u2019s work in the New York Herald. Another time Marsh tried to keep Cope from getting his articles and books published, so Cope hired two fossil-finders away from Marsh.p257\nIn 1889, U.S. Geological Survey stopped giving grants to Cope. Marsh persuaded John Wesley Powell to ask Cope to give the Survey the specimens Cope found back in 1874.p233/7 249 Cope did not want to give the fossils to the Survey because when he found them he was a volunteer paying his own way. So, he spoke to the \"New York Herald\".p245/9 The first article was on January 12, 1890. Cope said Marsh underpaid his workers, and said some of what Marsh wrote was really written by others. Also, he said Powell was spending tax money wrong and had made mistakes in classifying fossils.p404 Later, another article gave their side of the story.p206 As a result of the articles, the Survey lost its funding for fossil-finding. Marsh got fired from the Survey. And, Cope almost got fired from the University of Pennsylvania.p329/334 Cope wondered if people thought of him as \u201ca liar . . . actuated by jealousy and disappointment.\u201d He seemed sorry Marsh had been fired, writing to Paleontologist Henry Osborn, \u201cI think Marsh is impaled on the horns of \"Monoclonius sphenocerus\".p408\nLater years.\nIn 1882 Cope wrote a paper about a fossil pelycosaur \"Edaphosaurus\". It looked like a lizard with a huge fin along its back. In 1886 Professor Cope fired his fossil diggers and started selling some of his large fossil collection to museums. He also wrote forty more scientific reports about their findings that year.p242\nIn 1889 he reported \"Coelophysis\", a slender dinosaur from the Upper Triassic. This little carnivore is one of the earliest dinosaurs found. The same year, he succeeded Joseph Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn 1892, Cope (then 52\u00a0years old) was granted expense money for field work from the Texas Geological Survey. With his finances improved, he was able to publish a massive work on the \"Batrachians of North America\", which was the most detailed work on the continent's frogs and amphibians ever done,p350 and the 1,115-page \"The Crocodilians, Lizards and Snakes of North America\".\nIn the 1890s his publication rate increased to an average of 43\u00a0articles a year.p350 His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sights in Texas and Oklahoma.\nIn 1895 Cope re-hired Sternberg, who knew about the nightmares he had about dinosaurs, to look for fossils for him.p358\nCope sold fossils to museums. For example, in 1895 the American Museum of Natural History in New York City bought his collection of about 10,000\u00a0 fossil mammals.\nCope sold three other collections for $29,000. Although his collection still contained more than 13,000\u00a0specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was much smaller than Marsh's collection, which was valued at over a million\u00a0dollars.\nCope's death.\nIn 1896 Cope got sick, and he died on April 12, 1897. His friends told of how they remembered him. They then held the reading of his will. The \"American Journal of Science\" had an obituary about Cope. The \"Naturalist\" had a longer one. And, the National Academy of Sciences' journal had one years later.\nCope's ideas and character.\nEdward D. Cope was a Quaker. His biographer Henry Osborn wrote, \u201cIf Edward... (had) doubts about the... Bible... he did not (tell) them in his letters to his family, but there can be little question... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period\". Cope was conservative about women working or voting. He felt the husband should be able to take care of his wife and that married women would vote the same as their husbands.p176\nHe was remembered as not liking the Negro accent, and he believed that if \"a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like\".p26, 169, 176\nAlthough his daughter Julia burnt many of his private papers, many of his friends have written about him. Charles R. Knight, a former friend, said that Cope's language was so filthy that \"in [Cope's] heyday no woman was safe within five\u00a0miles of him\".p109\nPeople said Cope had great energy and activity and was always interesting, kind and helpful. Others said he had a temper and said he was a \"militant paleontologist\". Some say he was well-liked by those who lived when he did.p202\nViews on evolution.\nCope said Charles Darwin's book \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" had \"too much geology in it\".\nOver his lifetime Cope's views on evolution shifted.p250 His original view, described in the paper \"On the Origin of Genera\" (1868), held that while Darwin's natural selection may affect the preservation of superficial characteristics in organisms, natural selection alone could not explain the formation of genera.\nCope's beliefs became one with an increased emphasis on continual and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a Creator.p259 He became one of the founders of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought, which holds that individuals can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring. Although the view has been shown to be incorrect, it was common among paleontologists in Cope's time.p68 In 1887, Cope published his own \"Origin of the Fittest: essays in evolution\", detailing his views on the subject. He was a strong believer in the law of use and disuse\u2014that an individual will slowly, over time, favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations. This theory fails because use and disuse does not affect the genetic code of the gametes, something which became clear in the generations after his death."}

They were interested in natural selection, genetic drift, and other aspects of population genetics.\nIn 1989 Diane Dodd gave laboratory populations of \"D. pseudoobscura\" two different food types, starch and maltose. They rapidly evolved into two distinct groups after only eight generations with the different foods. As the two groups both showed a strong preference for mating with their own type, this was claimed as an example of speciation by reproductive isolation. Dodd's experiment has been repeated by others, and works with other kinds of fruit flies and foods.\nIn 2005, \"D. pseudoobscura\" was the second \"Drosophila\" species to have its genome sequenced, after \"Drosophila melanogaster\"."}

She was later regent of Lorraine. As a widow she was created Princess of Commercy. Among her children was Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, father of Marie Antoinette. She also had much input in the construction of the \"Ch\u00e2teau de Lun\u00e9ville\". She also introduced the future architect \"Germain Boffrand\" to the royal courts in 1711. \nFamily.\n\u00c9lisabeth Charlotte was born at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud the daughter of Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and of his second wife, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Her father was the only sibling of King Louis XIV of France.\nShe was entitled to have the style of \"Her Royal Highness\". At birth, she was given the honorary style \"Mademoiselle de Chartres\". After the marriage of her two older half-sisters, Marie Louise and Anne Marie born of the first marriage of their father to Henrietta of England, she was known as \"Madame Royale\", according to her status as the highest-ranking unmarried princess in France.\nMarriage.\nThere were plans for her to marry Joseph Clemens of Bavaria (\u00c9lisabeth Charlotte herself refused), William III of England, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I, Joseph was suggested by Pope Innocent XII himself, as well as her widowed first cousin Louis, Grand Dauphin. Another was Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, eldest son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.\n\u00c9lisabeth Charlotte was finally married on 13 October 1698 at the Palace of Fontainebleau to Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, son of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, and of the Archduchess Eleonora of Austria. The marriage was the result of the Treaty of Ryswick, one of its conditions being that the Duchy of Lorraine, which had been for many years in the possession of France, be restored to Leopold, a son of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. Thus, \u00c9lisabeth Charlotte was but an instrument to cement the peace treaty. The House of Lorraine received a dowry of 900,000 Livres. \nTo everyone surprise, what had been expected to be an unhappy union turned out to be a marriage of love and happiness. With the birth of her children, \u00c9lisabeth Charlotte showed great maternal instinct and a naturally caring character. The marriage produced thirteen children, of which five survived into adulthood. Three of them died within a week in May 1711 due to a smallpox outbreak at the Ch\u00e2teau de Lun\u00e9ville, the country seat of the Duke's of Lorraine.\nRegent of Lorraine.\nHer husband died in 1729, leaving his wife Regent of Lorraine for their son, Francis Stephen of Lorraine. After being educated in Vienna, Francis Stephen returned to Lorraine in 1737, ending his mother's tenure as regent.\n\u00c9lisabeth Charlotte tried to engage her youngest child Anne Charlotte to King Louis XV; this project failed due to the intrigues of Duke of Bourbon; \u00c9lisabeth Charlotte then tried to arrange the marriage of Anne Charlotte to her first cousin Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, who had been recently widowed; Louis d'Orl\u00e9ans refused. \nLater years.\nUnable to prevent her son from giving up the duchy of Lorraine to Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski when he married the Habsburg heiress, Maria Theresa of Austria, \u00c9lisabeth Charlotte moved into the \"Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Harou\u00e9\" in nearby Commercy, which was turned into a sovereign principality for her to enjoy during her dowager years. \n\u00c9lisabeth Charlotte died of a stroke, on 23 December 1744, one week after her daughter-in-law and grandchild, at the age of sixty-eight. She was the last of her siblings to die and had outlived ten of her thirteen children. Nine months after her death, her son Francis Stephen became Holy Roman Emperor.\nShe was buried in the funerary chapel of the Dukes of Lorraine in the \"Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-des-Cordeliers\" church in Nancy."}

At the death of her brother, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, \"prince de Lamballe\", she became the wealthiest heiress in France. She married the future \"Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9\", and was the mother of France's last king, Louis Philippe I. She was a princess of the blood by her marriage.\nBackground.\nMarie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was born on 13 March 1753 at the H\u00f4tel de Toulouse in Paris. Styled \"Mademoiselle d'Ivoy\" initially and, as a young girl, until her marriage, \"Mademoiselle de Penthi\u00e8vre\" (derived from the duchy inherited by her father). The style of \"Mademoiselle de Penthi\u00e8vre\" had been previoulsy borne by her sister Marie Louise de Bourbon (1751\u20131753) who died six months after Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde's birth. She was raised in a convent, the \"Abbaye de Montmartre\", overlooking Paris. \nMarriage.\nAt the death, on 8 May 1768, of her brother and only sibling, the Prince of Lamballe, Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde became heiress to what was to become the largest fortune of France. Her marriage to Louis \"Philippe\" Joseph d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Chartres, son of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, had been envisaged earlier and, while the Duke of Penthi\u00e8vre saw in it the opportunity for his daughter to marry into the family of the \"First Prince of the Blood\", the Orl\u00e9ans did not want a union with an illegitimate branch of the royal family. However, the Orl\u00e9ans' mind changed when the Prince of Lamballe's death left his sister sole heiress to the family fortune. Although Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00eede was much in love with her Orl\u00e9ans cousin, Louis XV warned Penthi\u00e8vre against such a marriage because of the reputation of the young Duke of Chartres as a womaniser.\nHer marriage to the Duke of Chartres took place at the Palace of Versailles on 5 April 1769. \nDuring the first few months of their marriage, the couple appeared devoted to each other, but the duke went back to the life of \"libertinage\" he had led before his marriage. It is during the summer of 1772, a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter, that began Philippe's secret liaison with one of her ladies-in-waiting, Madame de Genlis, the niece of Madame de Montesson, the morganatic wife of Philippe's father. Passionate at first, the liaison cooled within a few months and, by the spring of 1773, was reported to be \"dead\". After the romantic affair was over, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 remained in the service of Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde at the Palais-Royal, a trusted friend to both Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Philippe. They both appreciated her intelligence and, in July 1779, she became the governess of the couple's twin daughters born in 1777. \nRevolution.\nOn 5 April 1791, Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde left her unfaithful husband and went to live with her father at the \"ch\u00e2teau de Bizy\" in Normandy. In September 1792, having sided with the Revolution, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans was elected to the National Convention under the name of \"Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9\". Siding with the radical group called The Mountain (\"La Montagne\"), he was from the very beginning suspect in the eyes of the Girondists (\"Girondins\"), who wanted all the Bourbons to be banished from France. The fate of the Orl\u00e9ans family was sealed when Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde's eldest son, the duc de Chartres, \"G\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00c9galit\u00e9\" in the Army of the North commanded by Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez, sought political asylum from the Austrians in March 1793. On 6 April, all the members of the Orl\u00e9ans family still remaining in France were arrested.\nAfter their arrest in Paris, Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9 and his son, the comte de Beaujolais, were imprisoned in the Abbey prison (\"prison de l'Abbaye\") in Paris. Later, the two were transferred to the prison of Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille, where they were soon joined by the duc de Montpensier who had been arrested while serving as an officer in the Army of the Alps. The day before his father and brothers were arrested in France, the duc de Chartres rushed to Tournai, near the French border, where his sister Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Mme de Genlis had been living since Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9 had made them emigrate in November 1792.\nUpon the execution of her husband, Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, now known as \"Veuve \u00c9galit\u00e9\" (Widow \"\u00c9galit\u00e9\"), was incarcerated at the Luxembourg Palace, which had been transformed into a prison during the Revolution. There she met the man who was to become the \"love of her life\", a former member of the National Convention named Jacques-Marie Rouzet. The two always remained together and lived in Paris until 1797, when a decree banished the remaining members of the House of Bourbon from France.\nMarie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was exiled to Spain, as was her sister-in-law Bathilde d'Orl\u00e9ans. Rouzet accompanied them to the Spanish border and managed to secretly join them in Barcelona where he became her chancellor. \nMarie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, Rouzet and the Orl\u00e9ans exiled in Spain returned to France in 1814 at the time of the first Bourbon Restoration. After legal battles which lasted until her death, the bulk of her inheritance was eventually recovered. She died in her castle at Ivry-sur-Seine having suffered from breast cancer. She also was buried at the \"Chapelle royale de Dreux\"."}

It was based on an incident that was remembered by Pope's friend, John Caryll. Arabella Fermor and Robert Petre were both from Catholic families at a time in England when Anglicanism was very important. Petre, lusting after Arabella, had cut a lock of her hair to keep without permission, which made the two families have a big argument. This was because in those days, cutting off a lock of the lover's hair was scandalous and symbolized improper love. Pope, also a Catholic, wrote the poem to make the two families reconcile and be happy again. He made the character Belinda to represent Arabella in the poem.\nPope's poem mocks all the traditions of classics. Although the poem is funny at times, Pope keeps a sense that beauty is fragile, and that just because Belinda loses a lock of her hair she is very deeply hurt.\nThree of Uranus's moons are named after characters from \"The Rape of the Lock\": Belinda, Umbriel, and Ariel."}

What makes them different from other baryons (particles made of three quarks) is that they must have at least one strange quark, but no charm quarks or bottom quarks. Strange quarks have a property known as strangeness. Strangeness causes the strange quark\u2013and all other particles bonded with it\u2013to not decay by strong force, but instead due to the much slower weak force. Since all quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can be in the same point in space at the same point in time), each quark has a spin of 1/2, adding up to a total spin of 3/2 for a hyperon. This quickly decays into a 1/2 spin particle.\nHyperons themselves decay due to weak force. There are dozens of different hyperon combinations. For example, a \u039b (lambda) hyperon has a charge of 0, and is often written as \u039b0. When it decays, it usually creates one proton, and one antipion. Like many forms of weak force decay, there is more than one possible outcome. A \u039b0 also has a significantly lower, but still possible, chance to decay into a neutron and an uncharged pion. \u039b0 hyperons have an average lifespan of 2.6x10\u221210 seconds, which makes it one of the longest living hyperons.\nScientists still study hyperons in labs across the world, such as CERN, Fermilab, and SLAC. Hyperons provide answers questions for problems such as , in which symmetries that were believed to be true may not be true."}

Most historians count 87\u00a0members of the party. Stephen McCurdy in the \"Western Journal of Medicine\" includes three others, bringing the number to 90. Forty-Two of them died from starvation, disease and the cold weather. The rest reached California the following year. They became famous in the history of the American West.\nJourney.\nThe party left Springfield, Illinois in April 1846. They were led by two brothers, Jacob and George Donner. The settlers followed the California Trail to Fort Bridger in Wyoming. From there, they left the trail to take a different route that was not used much. It was reportedly a shorter way to California. This route was called the Hastings' Cutoff. There was much hardship and suffering on this route. They wasted 18 precious days. Instead of being shorter, it took them much longer to get across Nevada.\nOn October 28, heavy snows trapped the settlers in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The group made shelters, but ran out of food. Some of them resorted to cannibalism in order to survive.\nOn December 16, seventeen people tried to go west again. Of these, two went back to the camp. Of the fifteen who kept going, seven stayed alive and reached a settlement on the western side of the mountains after 32 days. After this, a rescue party went back, and in about two weeks made it to one of the camps set up in the mountains. After this, three more groups tried to rescue those trapped in the mountains. The last person was rescued on April 7,1847. In all, 45 people from the original Donner Party died, and there were 36 who survived. All the survivors made it to California, but they disagreed about what happened during the winter and whose fault it was.\nMemorials.\nToday, there are several memorials to the group, including a monument and the Donner Memorial State Park. A lake was also named after them.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Puppet History\" talked about the Donner Party in the episode \"The Grisly Journey of the Donner Party.\""}

Knight", "text": "Charles Robert Knight (October 21, 1874 \u2013 April 15, 1953) was an American artist famous for his paintings of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals.\nHis works were reproduced in many books, and are on display at several major museums in the United States.\nEarly career.\nAs a child, Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals, and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his father\u2019s natural history books. Though legally blind, he was partially sighted. He had severe astigmatism, and a later injury to his right eye, but had specially-designed glasses. At twelve, he enrolled at the Metropolitan Art School to become a commercial artist.\nIn his free time, Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History, and attracted the attention of Dr. Jacob Wortman. Soon the museum commissioned Knight to produce a series of watercolors for their fossil halls.\nThese paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued to work with the museum well into the 1930s. He painted what would become some of the most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.\nOne of Knight's best-known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897\u2019s \"Leaping Laelaps\", one of the few pre-1960s images to present dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures. This was long before the theories of modern paleontologists like Robert Bakker.\nOther familiar American Museum paintings include Knight\u2019s portrayals of \"Agathaumas\", \"Allosaurus\", \"Brontosaurus\", \"Smilodon\", and the Woolly Mammoth. All of these have been reproduced many times.\nNationwide attention.\nSoon, natural history museums throughout the country began asking Knight for paintings as background for their own fossil exhibits. In 1925 Knight produced an elaborate mural for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This illustrated some of the birds and mammals whose remains had been found in the nearby La Brea Tar Pits.\nThe following year, Knight began a 28-mural series for Chicago\u2019s Field Museum of Natural History, a project which showed the history of life on earth and took four years to complete. At the Field Museum, he produced one of his best-known pieces, a mural featuring \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Triceratops\". This confrontation scene between a predator and its prey would inspire many imitations, establishing the two dinosaurs as 'mortal enemies' in the popular consciousness.\nKnight\u2019s work also found its way to the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh; the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C.; and Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, among others. Several zoos, such as the Bronx Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Brookfield Zoo, also got Knight to paint murals of their living animals.\nKnight illustrated books and magazines, and became a frequent contributor to \"National Geographic\". He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own, such as \"Before the Dawn of History\" (Knight, 1935), \"Life Through the Ages\" (1946), \"Animal Drawing: Anatomy and Action for Artists\" (1947), and \"Prehistoric Man: The Great Adventure\" (1949). Additionally, Knight became a popular lecturer, describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country.\nLegacy.\nKnight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity. Understandably, not all of his creations were based on solid evidence. His painting of ceratopsians as solitary animals in lush grassy landscapes was incorrect. The grasslands which feature in many of his paintings did not appear until the Cainozoic, and ceratopsians are known to have been gregarious animals.\nKnight restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian-like limbs and narrow hips. In the 1920s, studies by palaeontologists had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian-like hips rather than those of a present-day reptile.\nKnight often restored extinct mammals, birds and marine reptiles in action poses, but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp-dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts. In his catalogue to \"Life through the Ages\" (1946), he repeated views he had written earlier (Knight, 1935). He described the great beasts as \"slow-moving dunces\" that were \"unadaptable and unprogressive\" while conceding that small dinosaurs may have been more active. In fact, by their long survival in a world of many predators, herbivorous dinosaurs were as effective as they needed to be.\nThe dinosaur tail.\nThe single most obvious fault in his dinosaur paintings was one he shared with all the paleontologists of his day. They did not realise the tail was used as a counterbalance, and so in movement was held horizontal, not dragged along the ground. In many species the ligaments of the tail were ossified (turned into bone), so the tail simply must have been horizontal. \"Deinonychus\" is a good example.\nThis issue, which was certainly not Knight's fault, limits the usefulness today of many of his best illustrations.\nAdmirers.\nOther admirers have included special effects artist Ray Harryhausen, who writes in his autobiography \"An Animated Life\", \u201cLong before Obie (Willis O'Brien), myself, and Steven Spielberg, he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. [\u2026] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight\u2019s work my mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings\u201d.\nModern publications.\nThough many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight (most notably Zden\u011bk Burian) Knight\u2019s paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts."}

It is in the north of Spain and was a little town until 1950. Since 1950 the city has changed a lot because of important industrialization.\nThe official name of the city is Vitoria-Gasteiz. People usually call it simply Vitoria or Gasteiz. In Basque it is called Gasteiz, and some Basque speakers call it Vitorixe.\nPopulation.\nIn 2010, Vitoria-Gasteiz had a population of more or less 240,000.\nBetween 1960 and 1970, the city grew a lot because people arrived to work at the new and great industrial companies. Statistics say the population doubled between these dates, and this is the motive for a great transformation, not only demographic but social.\nLater, in 1980, Vitoria-Gasteiz was named the Basque Country capital, and the new public institutions, the Basque Government and Basque Parliament were located in Vitoria. This was an important impetus for the tertiary sector. This, together with the great industrial firms were responsible for a big social change in the city.\nThere has been another change in the population as people have come from other countries in recent years to work in building and industry. This happened later in Vitoria-Gasteiz and the Basque Country than in other areas. Today, non-EU (European Union) newcomers form 5.8% of the population in Vitoria-Gasteiz, 5% in Araba and 3.4% in the Basque Country. The main motive why Vitoria-Gasteiz has more of these immigrants is because recently there was a lot of jobs in building, a sector where Basque people won't work.\nThe inhabitants in Vitoria-Gasteiz live in apartments, and there are not many detached houses like in other towns in Europe. There are nice neighbourhoods, some with big squares, trees and parks where young people and families with children live, and other older neighbourhoods with beautiful and narrow streets and where older people walk.\nIndustrialization.\nVitoria-Gasteiz became an industrial city in the second half of the twentieth century. There had been some companies already. For example, Bartolome Riego set up a printing press in the town for the first time in 1722.\nIndustries began on the outskirts of the city, away from the centre, special areas for making objects. Companies from Biscay (Bizkaia) and Gipuzkoa moved to Vitoria because land was cheaper there. Between 1950 and 1977, 833 companies started in the city.\nThe largest effects of this was that the city grew quickly, with many immigrants and a mixture of cultures. Between 1950 and 1975 the population grew from 53,000 to 173,000. In 1975, only 41.8% of the population had been born in the city.\nHistory.\nMedieval origins.\nVitoria-Gasteiz is a very old city. It was founded in 1180 by the Navarrese King Sancho VI, who conquered the small hill village of Gasteiz and decided to call it New Victoria.\nOnly nineteen years later the city fell into the hands Castille\u00b4s King Alfonso VIII. The new king enlarged the city with three new streets on the west side of the hill. (Correr\u00eda, Zapater\u00eda, Herrer\u00eda)\nIn 1202 a terrible fire almost destroyed the town.\nThe city prospered quickly it was on the shortest way between the Court of Castille and northern Europe.\nBetween the 15th and 18th centuries.\nIn 1443 another terrible fire affected the western part of the city.\nAfter that, new houses had to be built of stone and adobe.\nIn 1492 the expulsion of Jews had an negative impact and caused a long period of decline.\n19th century.\nIn this century the customs house was moved from Vitoria to the coast, seriously affecting the local economy. However, the effect was softened with the development of the services sector. In 1813 Spanish forces with their allies defeated France in the Battle of Vitoria, ending the French invasion.\n20th century.\nWith the turn of the century come the first modern factories. They were small family businesses. Now there are also multinationals, for example Mercedes Benz and Michelin.\nBetween 1950 and 1975 the city tripled its population and new districts were built.\nIn 1980 the Basque Parliament chose Vitoria-Gasteiz as the capital of the Basque Country.\n21st century.\nThe city is characterized as green and sustainable.\nWe could define the current Vitoria-Gasteiz as a city designed and planned to live in.\nBuildings.\nVitoria-Gasteiz has several important buildings. Its medieval quarter is in the highest part of the city.\nIts streets are narrow.

The European Green Capital Conference in Stockholm gave the award to Vitoria on 21 October 2011; Other cities competed, for example Barcelona, Malmo, Nantes, Nuremberg and Reykjavik. In the end Vitoria, the second smallest city, was champion.\nVitoria has a green ring around the city, with more than 11000 hectares (27,000 acres) of trees and different species of animals. There are also a lot of tracks for walking and cycing.\nWater usage is another reason why Gasteiz won the award, because it is one the cities of Europe than wastes less water - only 10%, and its inhabitants are reasonable consumers. Other towns lose 50%. 25% of domestic rubbish is recycled, but it is possible to improve.\nIt is true that a lot of inhabitants use public transport (trams and buses) and bike to move in the city but there are too many people who use cars.\nThe prize is very important for the city because its population has been working on improving its environment for the last 30 years. With the green capital prize the environment is the future for Vitoria and its inhabitants.\nMuseums and Art Galleries.\nThe Museo de Bellas Artes - the Fine Art Gallery - in Frai Francisco Walk (street) is of special interest.

This museum is in an old renaissance building in Aiztogile Street, recently renovated by the architect Patxi Mangado.\nThere are other interesting museums such as the Arms Museum in Fray Francisco Walk or the Museum of Natural Sciences in Do\u00f1a Ochanda Tower, a fort house built in the sixteenth century, in Jesusen Zerbitzarien Fundatzailean Street. Nearby is the Museum of the lanterns in Zapateri street.\nVitoria is also an outdoor museum with sculptures and statues in its streets by contemporary artists such as Oteiza, Ibarrola, Chillida, Casto Solano, Nestor Basterrechea, etc.\nCuisine.\nAlthough Vitoria-Gasteiz food is similar to the rest of the Basque Country, the city does have its specialities. \"Perretxikos\" (Calocybe_gambosa/St. George's mushroom), a type of mushroom, and snails are two traditional dishes of the city.\nIn early December, the province of Araba holds its \"cazuelitas\" (small dishes) and wine week. About twenty-five pubs participate, including more than twenty in Vitoria-Gasteiz, and you can eat small portions of local dishes and drink local wines. Another event, Vinogourmet, takes place about the same time. This fair is held in the city\u2019s food market, with wine on the ground floor and pintxos (bar snacks) on the first floor.\nThere is an important restaurant in the city. Its name is \"El Portalon\". It is located in a beautiful fifteenth century house. In this restaurant the food is very good.\nIn 2010, the Ikea restaurant won its first Michelin star.\nTourists say Vitoria-Gasteiz has very good cake-shops.\nLeisure.\nLeisure in Vitoria refers to several things, music and performing arts, concerts and festivals.\nThe city\u2019s most famous concerts take place in Los Fueros Square in the Blanca holidays in August, and very important Spanish groups come to Vitoria.\nThere are also events for the young.

However, many of the extinctions occurred before then in the Upper Triassic.\nOverall, this was one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon. It profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans. At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct. \nA whole class (conodonts: extinct chordates); 20% of all marine families; all large crurotarsans (non-dinosaurian archosaurs); some remaining therapsids; and many of the large amphibians such as the temnospondyls were wiped out. \nThe event emptied many ecological niches, and allowed the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the Jurassic period. This event happened in less than 10,000 years, and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart. \nScientists have suggested several explanations for this event, but all have unanswered challenges:\nRecent evidence.\nA recent paper in PNAS shows fairly clearly that mass volcanism was involved. It was probably the primary cause of the extinction. Mercury is present in volcanic rocks found at the end-Triassic boundary. \nMercury is emitted in gaseous form during volcanism, and deposited in sediments. The paper says \"Such episodic volcanism likely perturbed the global environment over a long time and strongly delayed ecological recovery\"."}

Its skeleton shows some features which are also found in early troodontids and avialans. However, its short forearms rule it out of the Alialae.\nDespite its late appearance, its structure is that of a basal dromaeosaur. Its small size, and the small size of other basal deinonychosauria, suggests that small size came before flight in birds.\nDescription.\nAlthough this individual was small, comparable in size to \"Archaeopteryx\", \"Caudipteryx\", and \"Mei\", it was close to adulthood. \nThis genus can be distinguished from other paravians (dromaeosaurs, troodonts, and birds) by details of the ulna, thighbone, ilium, and tail vertebrae.\nIt had a typical dromaeosaurid form of the second toe, with an expanded claw. \"Mahakala\" also had very short forelimbs compared to other Dromaeosaurs.\nClassification.\nA phylogenetic analysis performed by Turner and colleagues, who described the specimen, found \"Mahakala\" to be the most basal known dromaeosaur. Their results, along with the small size of other theropods found at the base of paravian lineages, suggest that small size was not an innovation of early birds, but a common trait of early paravians.\nIn evolution, small size would have come before flight. Like birds, troodonts and dromaeosaurs did not keep small size throughout their evolutionary history. They had several separate size increases among different lineages. \n\"Mahakala\" also shows a combination of characteristics found among basal troodonts and birds, and is missing some that are present in more derived (specialised) dromaeosaurs.\nPaleoecology and paleobiology.\nThe paleoenvironment had a semiarid climate, with sand dunes and alluvium (loose stuff). The semiarid steppe landscape was drained by streams after rain, and was affected by dust and sandstorms. Rainfall was low, and seasonal. \nAnimals present included terrestrial turtles and crocodilians, lizards, mammals, and a variety of dinosaurs; aquatic animals like fish were not present. The majority of the fauna was small to medium-sized. \nSmall coelurosaurians are the most diverse dinosaurs, including fellow dromaeosaurid \"Velociraptor\", troodonts \"Byronosaurus\" and \"Saurornithoides\", oviraptors \"Citipati\", \"Khaan\", and \"Oviraptor\", and alvarezsaurs \"Mononykus\" and \"Shuvuuia\"; other dinosaurs present included the ceratopsian \"Protoceratops\" and the ankylosaur \"Pinacosaurus\". Like other dromaeosaurs, \"Mahakala\" would have been a small, active, predaceous carnivore."}

Jacques Gauthier named Avialae in 1986 as \"all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and the birds that descended from them\".\nBranch-based definition.\nSeveral other authors use a similar, but branch-based, definition: \"all theropods closer to birds than to Deinonychus\"."}

Musically, the song is made of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and an epilogue, where the voice of an operator says that the phone line is not reachable. Knowles appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.\n\"Telephone\" was appreciated by contemporary critics who many times noted it as a stand-out track from \"The Fame Monster\". The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2011 for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. \nDevelopment.\nLady Gaga originally wrote the song \"Telephone\" for Britney Spears. Spears later recorded a demo version of the song but the demo version later leaked. Lady Gaga later wrote the song as a collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles for \"The Fame Monster\". Gaga said, \"I wrote it for her [Spears] a long time ago and she just didn't use it for her album. It's fine because I love the song and I get to perform it now.\" Additionally, the guest vocalist was originally going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Knowles the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as she felt that she seldom found time to just let loose and have fun. \nFear of suffocation\u2014something that I have or fear is never being able to enjoy myself,\u00a0... 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard to go out and have a good time.\u00a0... I don't go to nightclubs,\u00a0... You don't see pictures of me falling out of a club drunk. I don't go\u2014and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, I got to get back to work.\nIn May 2011, Gaga said her \"emotional connection\" with the song was very hard. When she was asked if it was because the song was originally written for Britney Spears, she answered: \"Well that\u2019s not exactly what happened, but I don\u2019t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it\u2019s my worst song it has nothing to do with the song, just my emotional connection to it.\"\nMusic video.\nThe video for the song was uploaded to YouTube on March 15, 2010. It features Gaga in a women's prison and Beyonc\u00e9 bailing her out. In the beginning of the video, Gaga is shown walking around the prison and arrives to the yard, where \"Paper Gangsta\", a song from her debut album \"The Fame\", is playing, as one of the women exercises. Gaga's younger sister Natali makes a cameo appearance just before Gaga picks up the phone to talk to Beyonc\u00e9. The two singers are then shown fleeing the prison in the Pussy Wagon and arrive to a restaurant, where they eventually poison all of the customers. The nine-and-a-half-minute-long video for \"Telephone\" is meant to be a continuation of that for \"Paparazzi\", where Gaga was shown being arrested."}

(Yellow fever was named because it often caused yellow-colored skin, called jaundice, in its victims.)\n\"Flaviviruses\" share a common size (40-65 nm) and symmetry (shape), and they look similar under an electron microscope. They are made of single-stranded RNA.\nHumans get these viruses after being bitten by an infected mosquito or tick. Usually, if a human who has a \"Flavivirus\" gets bitten by a healthy mosquito or tick, the human will not have enough of the virus in their blood to infect the insect. This means humans do not help continue the virus's life cycle (by infecting insects who go on to infect other people). However, this is not true for yellow fever or dengue fever.\nPeople can also get \"Flaviviruses\" in other ways, like:\nIt is not likely that animals can spread \"Flaviviruses\" directly to humans. Scientists believe that an mosquito or tick has to bite an infected animal before it can spread the virus to a human by biting that human.

Nothing is known about his music education. We know that in the mid-1660s he went to work for Prince-Bishop Karl, Count Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn of Olomouc. The prince loved music and kept many musicians at his court. During the winter of 1670-1671 Biber became a member of the Kapelle at Salzburg court. He was married there in 1672. There he played the violin and trained the choirboys and composed a lot of music. He probably had a lot of contact with other well-known musicians such as Georg Muffat. Although he was the greatest virtuoso of his time he hardly seems to have travelled about to play.\nIn 1690 Biber was raised to the nobility.

Quangos are arms-length bodies funded by government departments but not run by them. They are given power and paid for by government departments. \nThey were invented because most government departments do two rather different jobs. One is to make policy about how the country should be run, as indicated by laws passed in Parliament. This is called administration. Their other task is to run or operate the policies in action. Examples would be: to run the prison system, to collect taxes, to guard the country's borders, and so on. Quangos were invented to do the second type of task. They are supposed to do some practical job better than a government department could. Of course, if they fail, the fault is theirs, rather than the government department's. \nThe acronym is spelt out in various ways:\n\u2022 \"quasi non-governmental organisation\",\n\u2022 \"quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation\", \n\u2022 \"quasi-autonomous national government organisation\" \n\u2022 In the United Kingdom the official term is \"non-departmental public body\" or NDPB.\nHistory.\nThe term 'quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization' was created in 1967 by the Carnegie Foundation's Alan Pifer. He wrote an essay on independence and accountability in public-funded bodies. This term was shortened to 'quango' by Anthony Barker, a Briton, during a follow-up conference. \nMany quangos were created from the 1980s onwards. The UK government's definition in 1997 of a non-departmental public body or quango was:\nUK.\nAccording to the Tax Payers Alliance, in the year 2006-07, tax payers funded 1,162 Quangos at a cost of nearly \u00a364bn; equivalent to \u00a32,550 per household. About a thousand still remain.\nIn 2010 the British Government said it had earmarked (chosen) nearly 200 quangos for closure, and 120 more for merging. This was part of its Whitehall efficiency programme. In August 2012, the government said that 106 quangos had lost their public status since then. Some were axed, some were sold off, and some had their work done elsewhere. \nScotland.\nSince Scotland was given devolved self-government in 1999, their government has also set up a number of quangos.\nRepublic of Ireland.\nThe Republic of Ireland in 2006 had more than 800 quangos, 482 at national and 350 at local level, with a total of 5,784 individual appointees and a combined annual budget of \u20ac13 billion.\nIssues.\nDepending upon one's point of view, the separation of a quango from government might allow its functions to be more commercially exercised. Or else it might allow an elected minister to evade responsibility for spending public money. Quangos have been criticised as undemocratic, expensive and letting government grow too big.\n\"The Times\" has accused quangos of bureaucratic waste and excess. In 2005 Dan Lewis, author of \"The Essential Guide to Quangos\", claimed that many quangos were useless and duplicated the work of others. In August 2008 a report by the right-leaning pressure group the Taxpayers' Alliance, claimed that \u00a315 billion was being wasted by the regional development agencies, quangos set up to encourage economic development in their regions."}

{"id": "275841", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275841", "title": "Danny Lewicki", "text": "Daniel Vladimir Lewicki (March 12, 1931 \u2013 September 25, 2018) was a Canadian retired professional ice hockey left winger. He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1950s and early 1960s. Before becoming a professional, Lewicki was at the centre of a dispute over professional hockey signing practices. He was the only player to have won the Allan Cup, Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup while still a junior.\nEarly life.\nLewicki was one of eight children in the family of Michael and Anastasia Lewicki. Both Michael and Anastasia were born in Ukraine and emigrated to Canada where they met in Fort William, Ontario. The family lived in the area known as the \"Coal Docks\", an immigrant enclave near the docks in Fort William. The family shared a home with six boarders. In an abusive marriage, Anastasia left Michael when Daniel was two years of age. Two of the children were sent to Geraldton, Ontario where the eldest sister lived with her husband. Daniel, his mother, a sister and brother and a boarder lived in a two-room shack by .\nLewicki started skating at age five, first with bob skates, then a used pair three sizes too large. Until age twelve, Lewicki learned to play hockey by playing shinny on outdoor rinks. Organized hockey started at age twelve and Lewicki joined the Bantam Elks. This he did in secret, as his mother was strongly opposed to his playing hockey. Lewicki would hide his hockey equipment outside under the backyard stairs. The next season, Lewicki played for the North Star Bantams, moving up to the Midgets at age fourteen a year early, to play against boys sixteen and older.\nHockey career.\nJunior hockey.\nAt age fifteen, Lewicki got his first taste of junior hockey with the Columbus Juniors in their playoffs against the Winnipeg Monarchs. Lewicki would return to the Columbus Juniors the following season. That season, Lewicki would lead the Fort William league in scoring, and started attracting the attention of pro scouts from Toronto, New York and Detroit. Lewicki did not sign with any team, but was placed on the negotiating list of the Providence Reds by his coach, Leo Barbini, who did some scouting for the Reds. Barbini somehow managed to put Lewicki on the Providence list before Toronto and New York, who had filed at 12:01 am on Lewicki's sixteenth birthday.\nThe following season, Columbus would be defeated by the Port Arthur West End Bruins. After the series, Lewicki was invited to join the Bruins as they continued in junior series playoffs. The Bruins would defeat Winnipeg to advance to the Western title series against Lethbridge, Alberta. Port Arthur and Lethbridge would be tied 3\u20133 in a best-of-seven series. Lethbridge refused to play the seventh game in Port Arthur and the game was moved to Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens. The large ice surface favoured the Bruins and they defeated Lethbridge 11\u20131 to advance to the 1948 Memorial Cup final against the Barrie Flyers. The Bruins would defeat the Flyers in four straight to win the Cup and Lewicki would score the series-winning goal. The club had an impressive array of talent. Eight players from the Bruins would go on to play in the NHL. Lewicki was the top scorer in the playoffs, recording 40 points.\nAfter the Cup, the Toronto Maple Leafs bought the rights to Lewicki for a record price of $35,000 and a player. In the fall, Lewicki left Port Arthur to join the Stratford Kroehlers, coached by Barbini, his old coach. Before the regular season started, Lewicki was ordered to join the Toronto Marlboros by the Maple Leafs. Unbeknownst to Lewicki, Barbini had signed Lewicki to a \"C\" Form, which bound Lewicki at age eighteen, and not simply signed Lewicki to a negotiating list.\nLewicki refused to play for Toronto, but was told that he had to play for the Marlboros, or nowhere else. Lewicki received a telegram from NHL President Clarence Campbell advising him that he was suspended. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association took up Lewicki's case, but the CAHA stopped backing Lewicki short of any legal action. Stratford did as well, in the face of pressure from the Maple Leafs. Lewicki decided to join the Marlboros. The \"C\" Form, which Lewicki signed, became an issue in the Canadian Parliament, and was abolished a few years later.\nThe Marlboros were defeated in the playoffs that year, and, like in Port Arthur, Lewicki was invited to join another team on a playoff run. This time it was the Marlboros' senior team, in competition for the Allan Cup. The Marlboros defeated the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, then the Cornwall Calumets, the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds and the Sherbrooke Saints to advance to the 1950 Allan Cup final against the Calgary Stampeders. Lewicki would be named the MVP for the series as the Marlboros defeated Calgary 4\u20131. Lewicki scored 42 points in the 17 playoff games.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1950, Lewicki began his National Hockey League career with the Maple Leafs. As a nineteen-year-old, he made the team straight out of training camp. Lewicki was able to get a one-way contract at $10,000 for three years and a signing bonus of $3,000. Lewicki made his NHL debut on October 14, 1950 against the Chicago Black Hawks. In his seventh game, Lewicki scored his first NHL goal on a bounce off the glass that bounced off the back of the Boston Bruins Jack Gelineau. Lewicki became a contender for the Calder Trophy, although he had strong competition from future Hall of Famer Terry Sawchuk. Lewicki had 16 goals and 31 assists before a groin injury ended his season early. Lewicki would end up third in voting for the Calder. The team finished second to qualify for the playoffs. Lewicki was pressed into service on the orders of Conn Smythe, although he was not healed. To play he had to have his groin muscle frozen and taped before each game. Instead of being able to contribute as a scorer, Lewicki would play a checking role in the playoffs. The Leafs would defeat the Montreal Canadiens in the final 4\u20131 to win the 1951 Stanley Cup Final. Lewicki was an Allan Cup, Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup winner at the age of 20.\nLewicki spent the next three seasons mainly with the Leafs' Pittsburgh Hornets. Smythe was mad at Lewicki for getting married during the 1951 off-season. In Smythe's memoirs, he later regretted demoting a player to the minors for getting married, without naming the player. Lewicki may be the player, but he is not the only player to be demoted for that reason. Lewicki and another Leaf player John McCormack were both demoted following marriages. Despite a 36-goal, 45 assist and 81 point season in Pittsburgh, in 1954, the Maple Leafs sold Lewicki to the New York Rangers. Back in the NHL, Lewicki would respond with the best NHL season of his career, scoring 29 goals and 24 assists in 70 games and was named to the NHL Second All-Star team.\nAfter the 1957\u201358 season, the Rangers left him unprotected for the annual intra-league draft, and Lewicki became Montreal Canadiens property. Although he had a good training camp, and earned a bonus for his play, he was shipped to the Chicago Black Hawks. Lewicki and other players who had been picked from the Rangers' system were picked by the Canadiens simply to hurt the Rangers and the Canadiens had no plans to play them.\nLewicki played one season for the Black Hawks, who managed to make the playoffs, only to lose in the first round. In the final game of the playoff, referee Red Storey missed a tripping call leading to a series winning goal by the Canadiens. The fans at Chicago Stadium were threatening Storey, and Lewicki gave Storey his stick to defend himself. Lewicki was unhappy after sitting on the bench, and he handed Storey his stick, saying \"you need it more than me.\" Storey used the stick to defend himself to exit the arena. It would be both Storey and Lewicki's last game in the NHL. Storey resigned after criticism from league president Campbell, and the Black Hawks would sent Lewicki to the minors. Lewicki contends that the incident led to him being 'black-balled' from the league as he received no call-ups or any chances to make another NHL club for the rest of his career. Lewicki played for a few seasons in the American Hockey League before retiring in 1963.\nDeath.\nLewicki died on September 25, 2018 in the Toronto city area at the age of 87."}

Some of the protests were violent, but others were peaceful.\nBecause of the attack, Germany decided to make sure fewer people from other countries came into Germany for political asylum. It also banned some right-wing political groups.\nOn 14 October 1995, a German court sentenced the four people who did the attack. Three men, aged 18, 19 and 22, were given prison terms of ten years.

There are two types of solder; soft solder and hard solder. Soft solder melts easily with soldering irons and is used for electronics and electrical work. Hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch. Using solder is called soldering. \nThere are two main types of soft solder; lead solder and lead-free solder. Lead solders have about 60% (or 63%) tin and 40% (or 37%) lead in them. They are toxic because they have lead in them. They melt at around 185\u00b0C. Lead solder is cheap, so it used to be popular. In plumbing, a 50% tin and 50% lead mixture was used. People thought this was safe, but then they saw that the lead was coming into the water. Now lead solder is illegal for water. Lead solder was once used for food cans. After many years, the lead could come into the food. The cans poisoned people who ate the food. Lead solder is still used in electronics.\nIn 2006 the European Union, China, and California banned lead in consumer products. Lead solder became illegal in electronic devices in some places. Lead-free solder was needed. Many lead-free solders have tin, silver, and copper in them. They melt around 217\u00b0C. Sometimes indium is added to the solder to make it better, but indium is very expensive.\nMany times when a metal is being soldered, it oxidizes, making a layer of metal oxide that does not hold solder. Flux is added to react with the metal oxide and turn it back into the metal again. That helps the solder connect to the metal. Rosin is a common flux. Some electronics makers use fluxes that can be washed away with water. Some solders have a flux core, where the flux is inside the solder.\nAnother type of solder is used to connect glass to other things. They melt around 450-550\u00b0C."}
{"id": "275862", "revid": "756599", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275862", "title": "Frame-dragging", "text": "Frame dragging is a theory which says that space is elastic, and particles in it will exchange energy with it. In the scientific world, \"elastic\" means that when you apply a certain amount of force to an object (which will cause it to bend) and then remove the force, the object will return to its original shape and energy state. Also, space is referred to as spacetime, which is simply a way to bring together the concepts of space and time. This basically means that whenever space is affected, time is affected. Frame dragging would provide answers for very old questions about gravity, strong force, and wave-particle duality (how things like electrons can act like waves and particles at the same time).\nFrame Dragging Effects.\nIn frame dragging, particles spin, and this spin has energy in it. (It is important to note that this is not quantum physics spin, but an actual angular momentum spin; the particles are actually spinning). Since spacetime is elastic in this theory, it can absorb the energy (spin) of the particle. This would slow down the spin of the particle.\nGravity.\nMass has a strange effect that we experience in the normal world: it attracts other mass. Scientists have been spending centuries trying to explain this occurrence. Recently, they have discovered that mass has an effect that it can curve spacetime. This means that when mass is present, the shortest path through spacetime between two points is slightly bent towards wherever the mass is.\nSince the energy absorbed by spacetime has to go somewhere, many scientists predict that spacetime would be \"bunched up,\" or folded. This can also be phrased as a curvature (bend) in spacetime. This would indicate that the particle generated gravity. The reason that this theory is called \"frame dragging\" is probably due to the effect of particles effectively \"dragging\" or \"grabbing\" spacetime as they spin. Not only would space be curved, but time would as well.\nHowever, the way to imagine this \"gravity\" is not so much as the force that we normally consider when we think of gravity, since normal gravity is created as well (due to its mass). Basically, frame dragging is an effect that occurs when one object is moving near another, which makes both objects change their motion because of the other's motion. Frame dragging does not occur if an object is neither spinning nor moving. In effect, one object \"deflects\" the motion of the other, and the other way around.\nWave-Particle Duality.\nScientists such as Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger spent much of their lives trying to find an answer for how something like an electron can act like a wave and also act like a particle. Frame dragging states that since spacetime is elastic, it can also give the spin-energy back to the particle. Once the particle has all of its spin-energy given back to it, it acts most like a wave. At that point, it will once again begin using its energy bunching up spacetime. Once the particle is no longer spinning, it acts most like a particle. Then, spacetime begins giving the particle its energy back, and the cycle continues forever. This is how a particle can actually act like a particle and a wave at nearly the same time. No energy is lost during the cycle due to the conservation of energy.\nStrong force.\nFrame dragging also has an effect that if one particle is next to another, they can both save energy if one is absorbing energy as the other one is emitting it. (This can also increase the mass of both particles, using Einstein's famous equation that energy is equal to a certain amount of mass). This would encourage particles to group together, which would explain what strong force (a force that holds protons and neutrons in an atom nucleus together) is.\nEvidence for Frame Dragging.\nThere are effects that come out of the math of the frame dragging theory. Scientists are currently testing one which is that if one small spinning object is orbiting a larger spinning object, the smaller object will slowly adjust its spin axis (the imaginary line which an object rotates around) to align with the larger object's spin axis. This is known as the Lense-Thirring effect. They are testing this theory by having a gyroscope (an object that will normally keep its spin axis the same) orbit the Earth, and testing whether its spin axis will align with the Earth's spin axis. So far, scientist say that they have evidence that proves the Lense-Thirring effect (and possibly the frame dragging theory) to less than .5% accuracy."}

Its chemical formula is Sb2O3. It has antimony and oxide ions in it. It has antimony in its +3 oxidation state.\nProperties.\nAntimony trioxide is a white solid. It is the most common antimony compound. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with oxidizing agents to make antimony pentoxide and with reducing agents to make antimony or stibine. It reacts with concentrated acids to make antimony(III) salts and dissolves in strong bases.\nOccurrence.\nAntimony trioxide is found in two minerals, valentinite and senarmontite. Valentinite is a white mineral that is sometimes pale yellow.\nPreparation.\nAntimony trioxide is made when antimony is made. Stibnite is heated with air to make antimony trioxide. It is separated from arsenic by the boiling of the arsenic trioxide before the antimony trioxide boils. Antimony trioxide can also be made by a two step process. Stibnite is burned in air with calcium chloride to make calcium sulfate and antimony trichloride, which is reacted with water to make antimony trioxide.\nUses.\nAntimony trioxide is mainly used as a flame retardant. It is also used to make glass, enamel, and ceramic opaque (not clear). Some pigments have antimony in them. It is also used as a catalyst for making plastics. It is also used as a catalyst for vulcanizing rubber, making it more \"rubbery\" and less likely to crack.\nSafety.\nAntimony trioxide is somewhat carcinogenic.

The album was a success in the United Kingdom, reaching #13 in the albums chart; sales were limited elsewhere. A mix of electronic music, hip hop, dub music, '70s soul music and reggae, the album established Massive Attack as one of the most best British bands of the 1990s and the founder of trip hop's Bristol Sound. Music critic Simon Reynolds stated that the album also marked a change in electronic/dance music, \"a shift toward a more interior, meditational sound.

She was a granddaughter of Louis XIII of France. In her adopted country, she was known as \"Maria Luisa de Orl\u00e9ans\".\nBackground.\nMarie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans was born at the Palais Royal in Paris and was the eldest daughter of Philippe of France and Henrietta of England. \nCharming, pretty and graceful, Marie Louise was her father's favourite and she had a happy childhood. Marie Louise spent a lot of time with both her grandmothers - Anne of Austria and Queen Henrietta Maria. For a time she was raised with the future Queen Anne I of Great Britain, her first cousin who lived in France till 1670. Marie Louise's mother died the same year and her father married Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate in 1671. All her life, Marie Louise would maintain an affectionate correspondence with her stepmother. \nMarriage.\nShe was forced to marry Charles II of Spain. The proxy marriage ceremony took place at the Palace of Fontainebleau on 30 August 1679. On 19 November 1679, Marie Louise and Charles II were married in-person in Quintanapalla, near Burgos, Spain. This was the start of a very lonely existence at the Spanish court. Her new husband had fallen madly in love with her, whose beauty and charm were renowned, and his passion for her remained with him until the end of his life. The very rigid etiquette of the Spanish Court (it was even forbidden to touch the Queen), and her unsuccessful attempts to bear a child, however, caused her to suffer from depression. \nHer French attendants were all accused of plotting against the king and his family and, as a result, one of her personal maids was tortured under allegations. Due to the nature of the times, and the Spanish Court\u2019s hatred of the young French princess, there were even riots outside the Palace in Madrid where she resided. \nAfter years of trying and of increasing homesickness of her happy years in France with her family, Marie Louise turned to food. During the last years of her life, she became overweight. After horseback riding on 11 February 1689, she felt a severe pain in the abdomen which forced her to lie down the rest of the evening. She died the following night. \nHer husband was heartbroken at the death of his wife. At the time, there were rumours that she had been poisoned but it seems likely that the real cause of Marie Louise's death was appendicitis. Shortly after the Queen's death, the Spanish ministers began to look for a second wife for the King. The main candidates were the Tuscan princess Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici and the Maria Anna of Neuburg and the latter was chosen. Charles II died childless in 1700 ending the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg."}

Her regency officially ended in 1680 but she maintained power for four years until her son banished her from further influence in the state. She left a considerable architectural legacy in Turin and was responsible for the remodelling of the Palazzo Madama which was her private residence.

He also held the titles of Marquis of Saluzzo, Duke of Montferrat, Prince of Piedmont, Count of Aosta, Moriana and Nizza. \nBiography.\nHe was the only child born to Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy and Marie Jeanne of Savoy. At his fathers death in 1675, his mother took over a regency in the name of her nine year old son and would remain in de facto power till 1684 when Victor Amadeus banished her further involvement in the state. Louis XIV organised his marriage to Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans in order to maintain French influence in the Duchy but Victor Amadeus soon broke away from the influence of France. Anne Marie was a devoted wife but Victor Amadeus did not love her. \nHaving fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, he became king of Sicily in 1713 but he was forced to exchange this title and instead became king of Sardinia to which his direct descendants claim as part of the Kingdom of Italy. He abdicated in 1730 and the crown was inherited by his son Charles Emmanuel III. Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural influence in Turin remodelling the Royal Palace of Turin, Palace of Venaria, Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi as well as building the Basilica of Superga where he rests.\nFamily and issue.\nHis distant relationship with his mother was always strained and has been blamed on her ambition to keep power to herself. Marie Jeanne spent most of her time relegated to state business which she enjoyed and had little time for her only child whom she kept under close supervision in order to make sure he would try to assume power. Anne Marie gave her husband six children but also had two stillbirths of each gender one in 1691 and again in 1697. Three of these children would go on to have further progeny including the eldest Maria Adelaide who was the mother of Louis XV of France. His second daughter Maria Luisa known in the family as \"Louison\" would marry Philip V of Spain in 1701 and was also regent of Spain for various periods. These two marriages were tactics used by Louis XIV to keep Victor Amadeus close to France prior to the War of the Spanish Succession.\nAnne Marie would remain a devoted wife. She quietly accepted his extramarital affairs the longest one being with the famed beauty Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert by whom he had two children. Jeanne Baptiste was his mistress for eleven years and eventually fled Savoy due to Victor Amadeus' obsession with her. Victor Amadeus subsequently had his daughter including the future Maria Vittoria marry the Prince of Carignan from which the present Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples is a direct descendant. His favourite child was Victor Amadeus born in 1699 and given the title Prince of Piedmont as heir apparent. At the death of the Prince of Piedmont in 1715 from smallpox Victor Amadeus II was very upset. His devoted wife Anne Marie died in 1728 after a series of heart attacks.\nHis relationship with his younger son and eventual successor Charles Emmanuel was a cold one and the two were never close. Victor Amadeus organised the first two marriages of Charles Emmanuel the first one being to Anne Christine of Sulzbach, daughter of the Count Palatine of Sulzbach which produced a son which died in infancy. The second marriage was to Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg a first cousin of Anne Christine and mother of six children including the future Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia."}

He served from 15 October 1970 until he was assassinated by Islamic extremists on 6\u00a0October 1981.\nEarly life.\nSadat was born in 1918 into a family with 13 children, and attended a military school. After his graduation, he was sent to an outpost where he met and became a close friend of Gamal Abdel Nasser. There, the two of them became part of a group of young soldiers who later became the Free Officers group (both Nasser and Sadat were colonels) that overthrew the Muhammad Ali Dynasty in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Nasser became the president after the revolution, and Sadat served as one of Nasser's ministers until he died in 1970.\nPresidency.\nSadat was chosen as president because Nasser's supporters saw him as someone who they could control. They did not think he would be president for very long. However, in his eleven years as president Sadat changed a lot of the things Nasser had set in place, and made Egypt respected for its military strength and political power in the Middle East. On 6 October 1973, Sadat started the October War together with Syria, to try to take back the land Israel had taken from them six years earlier in the Six-Day War. The Egyptian army was very successful at the start of the war, and their advance across the Suez Canal into the Sinai Peninsula surprised Israel and the rest of the world. This success made Sadat a hero in Egypt, and for a time throughout the Arab World.\nSadat visited Israel in 1977 and made a speech in front of the Knesset about what he thought was the best way to bring about peace with them. He was the first Arab leader to visit Israel and recognize that it was a country. In 1978, after the Camp David Accords, he signed a peace treaty with Israel. This won him the Nobel Peace Prize, but made him very unpopular among other Arabs who did not support peace with Israel. This led to Egypt being suspended from the Arab League at that time.\nDeath and funeral.\nMany Islamists were very angry about the peace treaty. They made plans to take over the Egyptian government and kill all the main leaders, so that they could bring Egypt back to having an Islamic government instead of a secular one. In February 1981, the Egyptian government heard of this plan. In September that year, Sadat ordered over 1500 people arrested because he thought they might be part of the plot. These people included Islamists, but also the Bishop and other clergy, and many of Egypt's top intellectuals and activists. This arrest was very unpopular. However, Sadat missed a group of Islamists in the military who were led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli. This group assassinated Sadat on 6 October during the victory parade celebrating the crossing into the Sinai Peninsula. Eleven other people were killed in the attack, and 28 were wounded. At the same time, Islamists also took control of the city of Asyut for a few days.\nSadat's funeral was attended by many important people from around the world, including Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon, but only three Arab nations sent representatives, and only Sudan's head of state attended. Sadat was succeeded by his vice-president Hosni Mubarak."}

This was to stop it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.\nHistory.\nThe prison was built in 1876. At first it was only used for soldiers but after 1919 it was also used for civilian inmates. It held up to 600 inmates at that time.\nIn the aftermath of the Reichstag Fire of 1933, opponents of Hitler and journalists such as Egon Kisch and Carl von Ossietzky were held there in so-called protective custody. Spandau Prison became a sort of predecessor of the Nazi concentration camps. It was supposed to be controlled by the Prussian Ministry of Justice but the Gestapo tortured and abused its inmates, as Egon Erwin Kisch recalls in his memories of Spandau Prison. By the end of 1933 the first Nazi concentration camps had been built (at Dachau, Osthofen, Oranienburg, Sonnenburg, Lichtenburg and the marshland camps around Esterwegen). All remaining prisoners in \"protective custody\" in state prisons were transferred to these concentration camps.\nAfter World War II it was operated by the Four-Power Authorities to house the Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials.\nOnly seven prisoners were finally imprisoned there. Arriving from Nuremberg on 18 July 1947, they were: \nOf the seven, only four served all of their sentence; the remaining three, Neurath, Raeder, and Funk, were released early due to ill health. Between 1966 and 1987, Rudolf Hess was the only inmate in Spandau Prison. His only companion was the warden, Eugene K. Bird, who became a close friend. Bird wrote a book about Hess's imprisonment entitled \"The Loneliest Man in the World\".\nSpandau was one of only two Four-Power organizations to continue to operate after the breakdown of the Allied Control Council; the other being the Berlin Air Safety Center. The four occupying powers of Berlin would alternate control of the prison on a monthly basis, each having the responsibility for a total of three months out of the year.\nThe prison was demolished in 1987, largely to prevent it from becoming a Neo-Nazi shrine, after the death of its final remaining prisoner, Rudolf Hess, who had been the prison's sole occupant after the release of Speer and von Schirach in 1966. The site was made into a car park and a NAAFI shopping centre, named \"The Britannia Centre Spandau\" and nicknamed \"Hessco's\" after a British supermarket chain called \"TESCO\". All materials from the demolished prison were ground to powder and dumped in the North Sea or buried at the former RAF Gatow.\nIn 2006 a Kaiser's Supermarket, ALDI and a Media Markt consumer electronics store occupied the former prison grounds. In late 2008, Media Markt left the main shopping complex.\nThe prison.\nThe prison, first designed for a population in the hundreds, was an old brick building surrounded by one wall 15 feet high, another of 30 feet, a 10 foot high wall topped with electrified wire, followed by a wall of barbed wire. In addition, some of the sixty soldiers on guard duty manned nine machine-gun armed guard\u2019s towers twenty-four hours a day. Due to the number of cells available, an empty cell was left between the prisoners' cells, to avoid the possibility of prisoners communicating in Morse Code. Other remaining cells in the wing were designated for other purposes, with one being used for the prison library and another for a chapel. The cells were approximately 3 metres long by 2.7 metres wide and 4 metres high.\nGarden.\nThe highlight of the prison, from the inmates' point of view, was the garden. The garden space was first divided into small personal plots that were used by each prisoner in many ways, usually for growing vegetables. D\u00f6nitz liked growing beans, Funk tomatoes, and Speer flowers, although the Soviet director later banned flowers for a time. By regulation, all of the produce was to be put toward use in the prison kitchen, but prisoners and guards alike often skirted this rule and indulged in the garden's offerings. As prison regulations slackened and as prisoners became either apathetic or too ill to maintain their plots, the garden was consolidated into one large workable area. This suited the former architect Speer, who, being one of the youngest and liveliest of the inmates, later took up the task of refashioning the entire plot of land into a large complex garden, complete with paths, rock gardens, and flower displays. On days without access to the garden, for instance when it was raining, the prisoners occupied their time making envelopes together in the main corridor.\nControversy.\nThe Allied powers originally took over the prison in November 1946, expecting it to accommodate a hundred or more war criminals. Besides the sixty or so soldiers on duty in or around the prison at any given time, there were teams of professional civilian warders from each of the four countries, four prison directors and their deputies, four army medical officers, cooks, translators, waiters, porters and others. This was thought to be the wrong way to use the money and resources, and became a serious point of contention among the prison directors, politicians from their respective countries. The West Berlin government was especially unhappy at the arrangements because it cost them a lot of money but they still had a lack of space in their own prison system.\nLife in the prison.\nPrison regulations.\nEvery part of life in the prison was strictly set out by a set of rules designed before the prisoners' arrival by the Four Powers \u2014 France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Compared with other established prison regulations at the time, Spandau's rules were quite strict.\nThe prisoners' outgoing letters to families were at first limited to one page every month;\nA lot of the stricter regulations were either later relaxed, or deliberately ignored by prison staff. The directors and guards of the Western powers (France, Britain, and the United States), often complained about many of the stricter measures. The complaints were often vetoed by the Soviet Union, because it thought the rules should be stricter. The Soviet Union suffered 19 million civilian deaths during the war, and wanted the death penalty for all of the prisoners at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg. Western commentators accused the Russians of keeping Spandau prison in operation chiefly as a centre for Soviet spying, as they had an excuse to drive into western Berlin, and the soldiers often looked out over the city instead of into the prison grounds.\nDaily life.\nEvery day, prisoners had to wake up at 06:00 hours, wash, clean their cells and the corridor together, eat breakfast. They then stayed in the garden until lunch-time at noon (weather permitting), after lunch they rested in their cells, then returned to the garden. Supper followed at 17:00 hours, after which the prisoners were returned to their cells. Lights out was at 22:00 hours. Prisoners were given a shave and a haircut, if necessary, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday; they did their own laundry every Monday. This routine, except the time allowed in the garden, changed very little throughout the years, although each of the controlling nations made their own interpretation of the prison regulations.\nAll prisoners feared the months when the Soviets were in control; the Russians were much stricter in enforcing prison regulations and offered poorer quality meals. Each nation in charge would bring its own cook and, in the American, French, and British months, feed the prisoners better than regulations allowed. The Soviets would offer an unchanging diet of coffee, bread, soup, and potatoes. This rigidity was primarily due to the much-loathed Soviet director, who perpetually enforced these measures and whom Russian and Western guards alike feared and despised. Until this director's sudden removal in the early 1960s, the 'Soviet month' was dreaded. Afterwards, matters, including diet, were improved."}

He founded the Parma line of the House of Bourbon. He was a son in law of Louis XV. \nInfante of Spain.\nBorn at the Royal Alcazar in Madrid, he was the fourth child and third son of Philip V of Spain and his wife, Elisabeth Farnese. He was raised in Madrid and as a child showed more interest in art than in politics. He was created Count of Chinch\u00f3n, which he later ceded to his brother Louis in 1754.\nDuke of Parma.\nHis mother was the last of the Farnese, rulers the Duchy of Parma. The Duchy had been ruled between 1731 and 1736 by his elder brother Charles I, but exchanged with Austria for The Two Sicilies after the War of Polish Succession. Twelve years later, in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), Austria lost Parma, and Philip became the new Duke, founding the Bourbons of Parma.\nAs part of the Treaty of Versailles (1757) between Austria and France it was intended that Philip would become King of the Southern Netherlands, in a deal that would see French troops occupy key positions in the country \u2013 however this arrangement was repudiated by the subsequent Third Treaty of Versailles and Philip continued in Parma.\nParma was ruined by many years of warfare, and in 1759 Philip named the abled Frenchmen Guillaume du Tillot as his minister to restore the economy. He stimulated education and philosophy, attracting personalities like \u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac.\nPhilip died unexpectedly on 18 July 1765 in Alessandria, Italy, after having accompanied his daughter Maria Luisa on her way to Genoa, where she sailed for Spain to marry Infante Charles. Through Philip's daughter Maria Luisa, he is an ancestor of the Bourbons of Spain, the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies, and the House of Orl\u00e9ans.\nMarriage.\nPhilip married Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain on 25 October 1739. She was the eldest daughter of Louis XV. They had three children. The marriage was the first between the French and Spanish Bourbons, the other taking place in 1745 between Louis, Dauphin of France and Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain."}

He helped create the aqua-lung, helped marine conservation and was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. He was also known as \"le Commandant Cousteau\" or \"Captain Cousteau\".\nLife.\nEarly life.\nCousteau was born on June 11,1910, in Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac, Gironde, to Daniel and \u00c9lisabeth Cousteau. He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine. Cousteau attended Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the \u00c9cole Navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. After an automobile accident cut short his career in naval aviation, Cousteau changed to studying the sea.\nIn Toulon, where he was serving on the \"Condorcet\", Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles. Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy, and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935\u20131938) and in the USSR (1939).\nOn 12 July 1937 he married Simone Melchior (1919-1990), with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940\u20131979). His sons took part in the adventures of the \"Calypso\". In 1991, after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet. They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982), born during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife.\nDeath.\nOn the morning of 25 June 1997, Jacques-Yves Cousteau died at his home in Paris, aged 87 from a heart attack. Despite rumors, encouraged by some Islamic publications and websites, Cousteau did not convert to Islam, and when he died he was buried in a Roman Catholic Christian funeral. He was buried in the family vault at Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac in France. A street was named \"rue du Commandant Cousteau\" in a street which runs near his native house, where a commemorative plaque was affixed.\nHonors.\nDuring his lifetime, Jacques-Yves Cousteau received these awards:"}

It talks about how wealth is gathered and lost under capitalism. The term was first used in Werner Sombart's \"Krieg und Kapitalismus\" (\"War and Capitalism\", 1913) These ideas were first discussed in books \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848), in \"Grundrisse\" (1857) \"Volume IV\" of \"Das Kapital\" (1863).\nOrigin and meaning.\nCreative destruction is supposed to describe a theory of how the \"destruction\" of economic order leads to capitalistic economic ideals. A German Marxist sociologist (Sombart) is credited for using it first in his 1913 book \"Krieg und Kapitalismus\", which means \"War and Capitalism\" in English. The works and publications of Marxists such as Karl Marx himself, and Friedrich Engels, a socialist scientist, discuss the ideas of creative destruction.\nIn and after the 1950s, the term became associated with Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter is credited for making the theory popular. However, his idea of creative destruction was quite different from Marx's original theory. The term gained popularity within neoliberal or free-market economics where it is used to described processes such as downsizing. The original Marxist usage has, however, been maintained in the work of influential social scientists such as David Harvey, Marshall Berman, and Manuel Castells."}

Today, it exists in many states and often is one of the largest political opposition groups. The group is the world's oldest and largest Islamic political group, and the \"world's most influential Islamist movement\". Hassan al-Banna founded the group in Egypt in 1928. \nGoals.\nThe Brotherhood's stated goal is to instill the Qur'an and Sunnah as the \"sole reference point for\u00a0... ordering the life of the Muslim family, individual, community\u00a0... and state\". Since it was created, in 1928 the movement has officially opposed violent means to achieve its goals, with some exceptions such as in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or to overthrow secular Ba'athist rule in Syria (see Hama massacre). This position has been questioned, particularly by the Egyptian government, which accused the group of a campaign of killings in Egypt after World War II.\nIn Egypt.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood is banned in Egypt. People have been arrested because they participated in the group. To circumvent this ban, supporters of the group often run for office as independent candidates.\nOutside Egypt.\nOutside Egypt, the group's political activity is more traditional and conservative. Inside Egypt, the group is modernist and wants reforms to happen. \nIn Kuwait,for example, the Muslim Brotherhood says that women should not have a right to vote in elections. The Brotherhood condemned terrorism and the 9/11 attacks. Whether the group has ties to terrorist organisations is disputed. \nThe question whether and how to use violence has also led to disputes inside the movement. At times, those in favour of using violence split from the main group and created their own groups. Examples of such groups are Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (The Islamic Group) and Al Takfir Wal Hijra (Excommunication and Migration).\nAmong the Brotherhood's more influential members was Sayyid Qutb. Qutb was the author of one of Islamism's most important books, \"Milestones\". The book called for the restoration of Islam by re-establishing the Sharia and by using \"physical power and Jihad for abolishing the organizations and authorities of the Jahili system. Qutb believed these included the entire Muslim world. The book also reveals that Qutb no longer held the Brotherhood's ideas and that he was closer to the ideas of Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is concluded in the introduction and dedication of the book\" While studying at university, Osama bin Laden claimed to have been influenced by the religious and political ideas of several professors with strong ties to the Muslim Brotherhood including both Sayyid Qutb and his brother Muhammad Qutb. However, once Al Qaeda was fully organized, they denounced the Muslim Brotherhood's reform through nonviolence and accused them of \"betraying the cause of Islam and abandoning their 'jihad' in favour of forming political parties and supporting modern state institutions\".\nThe Brotherhood is financed by contributions from its members, who are required to allocate a part of their income to the movement. Some of these contributions are from members who live in oil-rich countries."}

The remix was done by the British dub producer Mad Professor. Mad Professor was contacted by Massive Attack after \"Protection\" was released to remix a song for a single. After the single was remixed, the band asked Mad Professor to listen to more of the album to find the possibility of more remixes. The project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album. Mad Professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow, pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasized, reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals (many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental) fade in-and-out in normal dub fashion, making a hypnotic, if hi\nnice\nrepetitive, mix. The result is, on paper, more textured than the original, but loses any sense of the jazzy feel of \"Protection\"."}

It has cadmium and sulfide ions in it.\nProperties.\nCadmium sulfide is a yellow orange solid. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide and cadmium chloride. It is used in an odd reaction where cadmium sulfide is sprinkled into a sulfide solution and light is shined on it. It starts making small amounts of hydrogen gas. \nOccurrence.\nCadmium sulfide is only found in two rare minerals. It is normally made artificially.\nPreparation.\nCadmium sulfide is made several different ways. Cadmium salts, normally the sulfate or the chloride (cadmium chloride), are reacted with hydrogen sulfide to make a bright yellow cadmium sulfide solid. When it is made for pigment, the cadmium sulfide is then washed, heated (to change it into the right form), and ground to a powder. It is then mixed with paint.\nUses.\nCadmium sulfide is used as a yellow pigment. Cadmium yellow is the name of the pigment. If selenide is added during the roasting process (seen above in \"preparation\" section), it can make an orange or a yellow pigment. Cadmium sulfide is a good pigment because it does not break down easily, is very bright, and does not react with air like other pigments can. It is toxic, though. \nIt is also used in photoresistors that are sensitive to infrared and red light. Cadmium sulfide is found around some bacteria that reduce sulfate to sulfide."}

{"id": "276372", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276372", "title": "Confuciusornis", "text": "Confuciusornis is a genus of primitive crow-sized birds from the Lower Cretaceous. It was found in the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations of China, dating from 125 to 120 million years ago. The bird was named after the Chinese moral philosopher Confucius (551\u2013479 BC).\nLike modern birds, \"Confuciusornis\" had a toothless beak, but close relatives of modern birds such as \"Hesperornis\" and \"Ichthyornis\" were toothed. This shows that the loss of teeth occurred more than once, in \"Confuciusornis\" and in ancestors of modern birds. This is an example of convergent evolution.\n\"Confuciusornis\" is the oldest known bird to have a beak. It is also the first known bird to have lost the long tail of \"Archaeopteryx\" and develop fused tail vertebrae (a pygostyle).\n\"Confuciusornis\" is one of the most abundant vertebrates found in the Yixian Formation, and \"several hundred\" complete, articulated specimens have been found.\nThe proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching, while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing. The head probably had a small crest or tuft.\nFlight.\nThe orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that \"Confuciusornis\" was unable to lift its wings above its back. Like \"Archaeopteryx\", it was thus incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight. This conclusion is not established at present. Peters sees \"Confuciusornis\" as capable of flapping flight but specialising in soaring flight. The bird's weight has also been debated. \nAn argument from Gregory Paul noted that \"Confuciusornis\" is commonly found as large groups in lake bottom sediments with little to no evidence of the bodies being moved after death. It would be highly unusual for gliding animals to be found in such large numbers in deep water. Rather, this evidence suggests that \"Confuciusornis\" traveled in large flocks over the lake surfaces, a habitat consistent with a flying animal.\nColour.\nIn early 2010, a group of scientists led by Zhang Fucheng examined fossils with preserved melanosomes (organelles which contain colour pigments). By studying the fossils with an electron microscope, they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil \"Confuciusornis\" specimen.\nThe melanosomes where of two types, which indicates that \"Confuciusornis\" had hues of grey, red/brown and black, possibly something like the modern zebra finch."}
