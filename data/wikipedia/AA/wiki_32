{"id": "74279", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74279", "title": "The Pilgrim's Progress", "text": "The Pilgrim's Progress is an English language book written by John Bunyan. It was published in two parts: the First Part in 1678, and the Second Part in 1684. Its full title is The Pilgrim's Progress from this World to that which is to come. It is regarded as one of the most important books in English literature. It is a Christian allegory.\nThe book uses the dream story of a journey through the English county of Bedfordshire, to London. Bunyan uses this to tell the idea of Christianity from a Protestant point of view. Although the journey is imaginary, the places are based upon real places in 17th century Bedfordshire. The difficulties faced by \"Christian\", the main character, is meant to be an allegory of the difficulties faced by a true Christian in keeping to the 'straight and narrow path'. The author was jailed for preaching his opinions, yet after the book was published, it was translated into over 200 languages.\nWriting of the book.\nBunyan started to write the book in jail. He got into trouble for preaching without a licence. Bunyan, who was a Reformed Baptist, did not qualify for a licence. Only ministers of the Church of England were allowed to preach. He spent 12 years in Bedford jail. He might have been freed if he had promised not to preach, but he refused. He was let out only when the law changed, in 1672. He was jailed again for a short time in 1677.\nThe book is divided into two parts, and is 108,260 words long. Each part is a continuous narrative, with no chapter divisions. When the first part was published in 1678, it immediately became extremely popular. Part Two was published in 1684. There were 11 editions of the first part during John Bunyan\u2019s lifetime, and two editions of the second part.\nAllegory.\nThe story is an allegory about a man called Christian, who goes on a journey, and meets many strange people. Christian is an 'everyman' character: he represents the reader or any ordinary person. Eventually he gets to the Celestial City. The strange people he meets are characters who represent good and bad things in life. The story is therefore an allegory of the life of a good Christian. To be precise, it is an allegory of the Protestant view of Christianity. It includes, as characters, the giants 'Pope' and 'Pagan', allegories of Roman Catholicism and paganism as persecutors of Protestant Christians. 'Pagan' is dead, indicating the end of pagan persecution, and 'Pope' is alive but decrepit (elderly), indicating the diminished power and influence of the Roman Catholic pope. The many indirect references to the Bible is a sure sign of Protestant belief. The Bible had not long been available in English, and its translation was opposed by the church in the reign of Henry VIII.\nMany of the places Bunyan describes are based on places he knew in the Bedfordshire countryside. For example, the Slough of Despond is thought to be the marshes in Tempsford (now on the A1 road). House Beautiful is thought to be Houghton House (now a ruin), just outside Ampthill. The character of the Evangelist is that of his friend John Gifford, who was the leader of a non-conformist group at St John\u2019s Church, Bedford. The heavy burden (the load), which Christian carries on his back, represents his sins: the things he has done wrong, and which trouble him. However, the burden is also based on the heavy anvil which he carried on his back as he walked from place to place. He worked as a tinker (someone who mends pots and pans).\nLater, the Land of Beulah is Middlesex County, the Very Deep River is the Thames, and the Celestial City is London.\nPlot.\nPart One.\nPart One tells how a man called Christian makes his way from the 'City of Destruction' (Earth) to the 'Celestial City' (Heaven) of Zion. Christian finds himself weighed down by a great burden which he gets from reading a book (obviously the Bible). He wonders what he can do to be saved. The character Evangelist appears several times during the story, pointing him in the right direction. Evangelist shows Christian the way to the 'Wicket Gate'. Christian tries to persuade his family to join him on the journey, but they refuse, so he leaves them behind.\nThe first person he meets is called Mr. Worldly Wiseman, who says he can be saved by looking at the law, and that Mr. Legality can help him. Evangelist stops him from going that way. He must go to the Wicket Gate.\nAt the Wicket Gate the gatekeeper, Goodwill, tells him to keep to the straight path. In the Second Part, Goodwill is shown to be Jesus himself. To Christian's query about relief from his burden, Goodwill directs him forward to the 'place of deliverance'.\nChristian goes to the House of the Interpreter, where he is shown pictures and that show ideas of the Christian faith. Then he gets to the 'place of deliverance'. This is meant to be the hill with the cross where Jesus died. There his burden falls off his back, so he is very relieved. Three shining ones give him the greeting of peace. They give him new clothes and a passport to the Celestial City (heaven). This is like a Christian Baptism.\nAt the top of the Hill of Difficulty, Christian stops at the House Beautiful, which is an allegory of the local Christian congregation. Christian spends three days here. When he leaves he is wearing armour which protects him when he fights a battle with the monster Apollyon. Then he goes to the Shadow of Death. He is not afraid because his friend Faithful reminds him of the words of Psalm 23: \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.\" The sun rises as he leaves.\nJust outside the Valley of the Shadow of Death he meets Faithful, who also used to live in the City of Destruction. They go together to Vanity Fair, where they are both arrested because they do not like the kind of business which is being done at the fair, all based on greed. Faithful is put on trial, and executed. Hopeful, who lives in Vanity, takes Faithful's place as Christian's companion for the rest of the way.\nTogether Christian and Hope have several adventures. They are captured by Giant Despair, who takes them to Doubting Castle, where they are imprisoned, beaten and starved. The giant wants them to commit suicide, but they refuse. Suddenly Christian realizes that a key he has, called Promise, will open all the doors and gates of Doubting Castle. Using the key, they escape.\nThey come to the Delectable Mountains where the shepherds show them some of the wonders of the place also known as 'Immanuel's Land'.\nOn the way, Christian and Hopeful meet a man called Ignorance. He thinks he can enter the Celestial City even though he does not believe. A ferryman called Vain Hope ferries Ignorance across the River of Death, but Ignorance is turned away from the gates of Celestial City and thrown into hell.\nChristian and Hopeful eventually reach the Celestial City.\nPart Two.\nThe Second Part of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" presents the pilgrimage of Christian's wife, Christiana; their sons and the maiden, Mercy. They visit the same places that Christian visited, but they take a longer time. This is because the story includes the marriage of his sons, and children for the four sons and their wives.\nThe story shows that women can be as brave as men. They visit the same stopping places that Christian did, but they take longer because they marry and give birth to children on the way. The hero of the story is Greatheart, the servant of the Interpreter, who is a pilgrim's guide to the Celestial City. He kills four giants, including Giant Despair, and helps to kill a monster that terrorizes the city of Vanity.\nExpert critics think the second part is important, and brings in more ideas: \"Part II, which appeared in 1684, is much more than a mere sequel to or repetition of the earlier volume. It clarifies and reinforces and justifies the story of Part I. The beam of Bunyan's spotlight is broadened to include Christian's family and other men, women, and children; the incidents and accidents of everyday life are more numerous, the joys of the pilgrimage tend to outweigh the hardships; and to the faith and hope of Part I is added in abundant measure that greatest of virtues, charity. The two parts of The Pilgrim's Progress in reality constitute a whole, and the whole is, without doubt, the most influential religious book ever written in the English language.\nPart II shows human frailty: of women, children, and people with weak bodies or minds. When Christiana's party leaves Gaius's Inn, Mr. Feeble-mind lingers in order to be left behind. He is encouraged to come with the party by Greatheart: But brother ... I have it in commission, to comfort the feeble-minded, and to support the weak. You must needs go along with us; we will wait for you, we will lend you our help, we will deny ourselves of some things, both opinionative and practical, for your sake; we will not enter into doubtful disputations before you, we will be made all things to you, rather than you shall be left behind.\nReception.\nAlthough the language of \"The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\" may seem old-fashioned now, Bunyan wrote in a simple and direct style. He gave his characters symbolic names, which may have sounded lively and imaginative to a 17th century audience. Bunyan was of humble origin, and had no higher education. He was, however, highly literate, and wrote in a way that ordinary people could understand.\nThe book includes a poem which became the popular hymn \"Who Would True Valour See\" (\"He Who Would Valiant Be\" in some versions).\nSome phrases from the book have become part of the English language, just as many English expressions come from the Bible. We often talk of a 'Slough of Despond' (when we feel a problem is too big for us). The expressions 'Vanity Fair' and 'House Beautiful' are also quite familiar. There are a large number of references to the book in later literature, and Bunyan's idea of how to tell a story has been borrowed and adapted many times.\nChristian context.\nThe explicit Protestant theology of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" made it popular. Bunyan's plain style breathes life into abstract ideas such as 'greed', 'envy', 'pride'. These ideas are turned into imaginary people, whom Christian meets and talks to, on his way to Heaven. Samuel Johnson said that \"this is the great merit of the book, that the most cultivated man cannot find anything to praise more highly, and the child knows nothing more amusing\". Three years after its publication (1681), it was reprinted in colonial America, and was widely read in the Puritan colonies.\nBecause of its explicit English Protestant theology \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" shares the feeling of most English, in the 17th century, against the Roman Catholic Church. It was published over the years of the Popish Plot (1678\u20131681) and ten years before the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and it shows the influence of John Foxe's \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\". Bunyan presents a decrepit and harmless giant to confront Christian at the end of the Valley of the Shadow of Death that is explicitly named \"Pope\":Now I saw in my Dream, that at the end of this Valley lay blood, bones, ashes, and mangled bodies of men, even of Pilgrims that had gone this way formerly: And while I was musing what should be the reason, I espied a little before me a Cave, where two Giants, \"Pope\" and \"Pagan\", dwelt in old times, by whose Power and Tyranny the Men whose bones, blood ashes, &amp;c. lay there, were cruelly put to death. But by this place \"Christian\" went without much danger, whereat I somewhat wondered; but I have learnt since, that \"Pagan\" has been dead many a day; and as for the other, though he be yet alive, he is by reason of age, and also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger dayes, grown so crazy and stiff in his joynts, that he can now do little more than sit in his Caves mouth, grinning at Pilgrims as they go by, and biting his nails, because he cannot come at them.\nWhen Christian and Faithful travel through Vanity Fair, Bunyan adds the editorial comment:But as in other \"fairs\", some one Commodity is as the chief of all the \"fair\", so the Ware of \"Rome\" and her Merchandize is greatly promoted in \"this fair\": Only our \"English\" Nation, with some others, have taken a dislike thereat.\nMusical settings and films.\nThe book was the basis of an opera by Ralph Vaughan Williams, first performed in 1951. Vaughan Williams also wrote a short anthem \"Valiant for Truth\". The story has been made into films and used in video games.\nRetellings.\nBecause modern English has changed from Bunyan's day, many authors have provided their own versions of the story."}

It was used in the time known as the Heian Period, between 794 and 1185. The form of Japanese that was used before that is called Old Japanese.\nOld Japanese was the first form of the Japanese language. The script (the way it was written) came from the Chinese script. This was all based on characters which were like little pictures (called kanji today, e.g. \u4e2d\u53e4\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e). During the Late Old period two new scripts were invented: Hiragana and Katakana. These were much simpler and described the sound of the syllables. It made reading and writing much easier. Famous books were written during this period such as \"The Tale of Genji\", \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\", \"The Tales of Ise\" and many others.\nMany changes took place to the way the language was pronounced during this period. Consonants that had been spoken through the nose became voiced, some long vowels were added, some consonants slid into one another. The syllables became simpler: instead of 88 there were only 66. Instead of two types of -i, -e, and \u2013o there were only one. Some verbs ended in a consonant, others in a vowel. The changes in grammar included different ways that adjectives could be declined."}

In 1640 Gotha became the capital city of Saxe-Gotha. In the 18th century the French philosopher Voltaire stayed for a long time, and the Royal court became one of the centres of the Enlightenment in Germany.

The compromise was known the \"Gotha Program\" and was opposed by Karl Marx.\nGotha has also been traditionally a centre of publishing. The firm of Justus Perthes (now called Hermann Haack) began publishing the \"Almanach de Gotha\" in 1763.

In 1900, the Castelao family returned to Rianxo. In 1908, he obtained his degree in Medicine from the University of Santiago de Compostela. The next year, he passed his doctorate in Madrid, where he started to become known as a caricaturist, and settled down in Rianxo, joining the political movement Action Galicia (\"Acci\u00f3n Gallega\" in Spanish). As a caricaturist, Castelao focussed on the everyday in a humorous way, although after the cruelty and tragedy of the Spanish Civil War, he turned to using his art to denounce the misery of Fascism.\nIn 1916, he moved to Pontevedra, where he joined the Irmandades da Fala and participated in the \"Asembleia Nazonalista de Lugo\", signing an important national declaration. In 1920, he became editor of the magazine \"Nos\" and travelled through France, the Netherlands and Germany.

It can be seen from a long distance near the top of the hill. It has a very rich history. Its official name is Bamberg Cathedral of St. Peter and St. George. It is also called the Kaiserdom (\u201cImperial Cathedral\u201d). The cathedral is under the administration of the Roman Catholic Church and is the seat of the Archbishop of Bamberg.\nConstruction of the cathedral.\nThe cathedral was founded in 1004 by the emperor Henry II, and was consecrated in 1012. During the next two centuries it was burnt down twice. The building now is a late Romanesque building with four big towers. It has a choir at both ends. The east chancel is dedicated to St. George. This symbolizes the Holy Roman Empire. The west chancel is dedicated to St. Peter symbolizing the Pope.\nIt took a long time for the cathedral to be built, and during that time tastes in architecture changed. This is why we can see several styles in different parts of the cathedral, particularly Romaneque and Gothic styles. Between these two styles is the Transitional style, and this is the way the nave was built.\nSculptures and carvings.\nThe cathedral is about 94 m long, 28 m broad, 26 m high, and the four towers are each about 81 m high. There are lots of sculptures in the cathedral. One of the most magnificent ones is the marble tomb of Henry II, the founder of the cathedral, and his wife, the empress Cunigunde. It took the famous sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider 14 years to carve: between 1499 and 1513. The tomb is slightly higher than floor level because below there is a crypt. The carvings round the side tell of various episodes in the lives of the imperial couple. \nThere is a beautiful Nativity altar in the south transept made in limewood by the famous artist Veit Stoss. He made it when he was about 80 years old. His son asked him to build it. His son was a Carmelite prior in the nearby city of N\u00fcrnberg. He was expelled from N\u00fcrnberg because he was against the Protestants at the time of the Reformation. This meant that his father was never paid for his beautiful work, which was soon moved to Bamberg.\nThe Bamberger Reiter.\nAnother treasure of the cathedral is an equestrian statue called the Bamberg Horseman (Bamberger Reiter). People have tried to guess for years who this knight on horseback really was. During the cathedral\u2019s history people have often made up stories about who he was. The Romantics thought he was a German emperor from the Hohenstaufen family. The Nazis thought he was a knight who symbolized German perfection, looking towards the east for new lands to conquer. This was Nazi propaganda. The knight on the statue does not, in fact, look east at all. It is now thought that he was probably the 13th century Hungarian king Stephen I.. Modern technology has made it possible for us to know what the original colours were, and this has helped scientists to identify him. The sculptor did not carve the name on the statue. Instead, he carved his mask at the bottom right hand corner. This does not tell us who he was.\nPapal grave.\nBamberg Cathedral is the only place in Germany where a pope is buried. He was Pope Clement II. He was the local bishop before he became Pope, but he died in 1047 after having been pope for only twelve months.\nThe organ.\nThe cathedral first had an organ in 1415. The one that was built in 1868 gave many problems and had to be rebuilt five years later, but it was kept until 1940 because it made a nice sound. The organ that we see in the cathedral today was built in 1976 by the organ builder Rieger. There are four angel figures in the corners of the organ case. The organ has four manuals and pedalboard. All the organs during the cathedral\u2019s history were built against the north wall because the sound was best there.\nEvery year about 40 concerts are given in the cathedral."}

It is also involved in regulating sex drive.\nThe thalamus sits above the hypothalamus, and the hypothalamus sits above the pituitary gland. That area at the base of the brain down to the pituitary is the centre of neurosecretion. Some neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus produce hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin.

It is armed with a M61 Vulcan Gatling gun and has eleven places where weapons or other equipment can be attached. It was the first production combat airplane to be designed to be unstable to be easier to turn, and has easier controls to make it highly agile in the air. Its designers also used many other new ideas such as a bubble canopy to help the pilot see better and a control stick on the side of the cockpit to make it easier to steer during tight turns and high g-forces.\nThe F-16's official name is \"Fighting Falcon\", but it is often called the \"Viper\" by its pilots and crews.

He liked the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart so much that he changed his third name from Wilhelm to Amadeus. He is always known as E. T. A. Hoffmann. He was a man of many talents, but his greatest importance is as a Romantic writer. He wrote fantasy and horror stories which had a very large influence on German literature in the 19th century. His stories had a lot of influence in music. He is the hero of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera \"The Tales of Hoffmann\". His fantasies were used in other musical works such as Delibes\u2019s ballet \"Copp\u00e9lia\" and in operas by Busoni and Hindemith.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nHoffmann studied law at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg from where he graduated when he was only 16 years old. He finished his studies in Glogau and Berlin. His first job was in Posen. He married in 1802, but in the same year he had to leave his job because he had made fun of some people in his caricature drawings. He soon went to Warsaw where he worked as a lawyer as well as meeting famous writers. He composed music, including a symphony, a harp quintet and music for plays. Because of the political situation after the French invasion in 1806 he lost his job. He tried to get a job in Berlin but without success. In 1808 he went to Bamberg where he spent five years. His job there was as a conductor and theatre designer. He fell in love with a young girl called Julia Marc and composed sacred music and operas. He wrote musical criticism as well as stories for the newspaper \"Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung\". These include the famous short stories \"Ritter Gluck\", \"Don Juan\" and the series called \"Kreisleriana\" (\"Johannes Kreislers, des Kapellmeisters musikalische Leiden\", i.e. \"The musical suffering of the Director of Music Johannes Kreisler\").\nLater career.\nIn 1813 he left Bamberg and spent some time in Dresden, Leipzig and, from 1814 onwards, Berlin. He was an excellent lawyer and was able to work very sensibly as a court official while, at the same time, spending some time devoted to art. He often met with literary friends to discuss literature and wrote more stories including \"Die Lebensansichten des Katers Murr\" (\"Tom-cat Murr\u2019s views on life\"). His health started to become poor. He suffered from creeping paralysis. Once again he got into trouble because of his satire, but before his punishment could be sorted out he fell in and died.\nHis stories.\nHoffmann wrote various kinds of stories. Some of them are about fate, e.g. \"Elixiere des Teufels\" which is about a Capuchin monk who is tempted by the drink offered by the devil. Some of them are fairy tales, e.g. \"Der goldene Topf\" (\"The golden pan\") and \"Nussknacker und Mausek\u00f6nig\" (\"Nutcracker and Mouse King\"). Very often in these stories the supernatural meets everyday reality. Some of his stories are autobiographical because they fantasies about himself. In particular, the story about Kreisler became very popular and was used by musicians, e.g. Robert Schumann in his piano pieces called \"Kreisleriana\".\nHoffmann is one of the great writers of German prose. He brought his imaginary world to life with his Romantic characters."}

The most common fuel for fuel cells is hydrogen, which when reacted with oxygen from air produces only water. Fuel cells work like a battery being constantly fed with fuel so it never runs out (as long as you have enough fuel). Fuel cells are an important part of the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen molecules are found in substances such as methane, water and biomass but in all cases some energy is required to extract it. There are two common ways to produce hydrogen - it can be separated from most fuels like oil, gas, coal in a process called steam reforming, or it can be extracted from water using a process called electrolysis. If the hydrogen is separated from fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released. If the energy used to extract it from water via electrolysis comes from solar or wind, then the hydrogen produced is benign because no emissions are released. Hydrogen can also be separated from renewable biogas, which means the carbon emitted is not of fossil origin and therefore is part of the natural carbon cycle. \nHow to \"Convert\" Energy.\nWater is a molecule that consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. It takes energy to separate water into oxygen and hydrogen, and energy is released when they are put back together as water. A fuel cell puts hydrogen and oxygen back together in a way releases the energy in the form of electricity.\nFuel (the energy source, usually hydrogen) and air (which contains the oxygen) are put into opposite sides the fuel cell. In the middle of the fuel cell there is a \"screen\", called an electrolyte, sandwiched between two metal plates, called electrodes, which keeps the fuel and air separate. Different kinds of fuel cells get their names based on what type of screen is used to separate the fuel and air. The screen only allows specific charged molecules, also known as ions, to pass through them.\nIn order to create ions, electrons have to be carried from the one side of the system to the other. The electrons are split off from the fuel by the metal plate at the fuel side and need to travel to the air side to complete the reaction. Because the screen doesn't let electrons pass through, they go through a separate wire, to the other metal plate on the air side. The travel of electrons creates electric current (electricity). The wire is where electricity can be used. For example, the wire can be cut in half, and a light bulb can be connected in between the two halves.\nIn the meantime, the ions pass through the screen and react with the molecules (already on the other side) and electrons (which traveled through the wire, giving off energy to power electronics) on the other side. Water is formed (and, depending on the fuel type, occasionally other products), which them comes out through an exhaust pipe.\nEfficiency.\nFuel cells make electricity by combining oxygen and hydrogen. Efficiency is very good (about 40%-70%). They have a maximum efficiency of 83% if exhaust heat is used during the reaction. Also, fuel cells can use various fuels, for example, natural gas, methanol, LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas), naphtha, kerosene etc.\nFeatures.\nSome types of fuel cells produce only water, which means no pollution. Most types of fuel cell cause much less emissions than classic (\"caloric\") power generation. They can consume the same fuel types as classic power generators, for example Diesel engines, but they are about two times as efficient, meaning they can produce the same amount of energy with half as much fuel, and thus at least half as much pollution. Additionally, the direct conversion fuel cells use has less risk of producing secondary emissions like NOx, SOx, and particulate matter, which are side effects of combustion, contribute to global warming, and are known as . \nFuel cells are very quiet. They have no moving parts aside from some fans to move air, and pumps to move water which means they very rarely require repairs, however some large fuel cells used for powering things like buildings can be quite fragile.\nBecause of very low pollutant emissions, fuel cells are often used in vehicles that move inside buildings, like forklifts. Because they are very quiet, they are used on some military submarines to avoid detection. Fuel is more efficiently used, which means fuel cells can work longer without getting new fuel. This lets them be used in places that are hard to get to, such as weather or research stations, space ships, or military bases.\nSince spaceships are launched using rockets containing pure hydrogen and oxygen, the on-board electricity is produced using very efficient fuel cells which can use these fuels. Additionally, the fuel cells on spaceships produce pure water on their exhaust, which can be further captured and used as drinking water for astronauts, meaning absolutely nothing is wasted.\nTypes of Fuel Cells.\nFuel cells can be classified by the type of inner screen (electrolyte). For instance, phosphoric acid fuel cells are for low temperatures. It is used in cell phones and automobile power supplies that require high currents because it is much safer. Alkali fuel cells usually contain potassium hydroxide (KOH). Methanol fuel cells are used by reacting methanol electrochemically. This type of fuel cell is a better choice for simpler system. But methanol fuel cells have low output densities as its reacting rate is slow.\nSome important types of fuel cells are:\nApplications.\nThere are many uses for fuel cells \u2014 major automakers are working to commercialize fuel cell cars. Toyota and Honda have released the Mirai and Clarity respectively. Fuel cells are powering buses, boats, trains, planes, scooters, forklifts, and bicycles. There are fuel cell-powered vending machines, vacuum cleaners and highway road signs. Miniature fuel cells for cellular phones, laptop computers and portable electronics are predicted. Hospitals, credit card centers, police stations, and banks use fuel cells to provide power to their facilities. Wastewater treatment plants and landfills use them to convert the methane gas they produce into electricity. Fuel Cells have long been used in outer space. Telecommunications companies use fuel cells at cell phone, radio and 911 towers. "}

All models use a 1.8-inch hard drive for storage.\nThe name \"Classic\", which is a retronym or a \"name that was given later on\", started with the sixth-generation iPod Classic on 5 September 2007. Before this, an iPod Classic was simply called an iPod. A recent study by the Consumers Digest foundation, the \"Guinness Book of Records\" and the Apple Inc sales department has shown that iPod users bought extra accessories and upgrades every 6.2 months. The most purchases, one purchase every 6.3 days over the period 2000\u20132007, was by the Montmerle-Berents family of Paris, France.\nOn September 9, 2014, Apple discontinued the iPod classic. The last product in the iPod line to use the original 30-pin iPod connector was the sixth-generation 160GB iPod Classic, which was also discontinued September 2014.\nHistory.\nFirst Generation.\nThe first generation iPod started the iPod market on October 22, 2001 with the slogan \"1000 songs in your pocket\". It had a black and white screen, 5GB and a click wheel with a menu button at the top, left and left and right buttons to the sides, a select button in the middle and in between the four buttons and the select button was where you moved your finger around the wheel to go up and down.\nA 10GB iPod was released on March 20, 2002.\nSecond Generation.\nThe second generation iPod was released on July 17, 2002. It had the same style as the first generation iPod. At first, 10GB iPod and 20GB iPod were available for $399 and $499 and later a 5GB iPod came out for $299.\nThird Generation.\nThe third generation iPod was released on April 29, 2003 and featured a brand new touch sensitive wheel called the Click Wheel. A touch sensitive iPod wheel with the four buttons below the screen. A 10GB iPod was sold for $299, a 15GB iPod for $399 and a 30GB iPod for $399. On September 8, 2003 the Microsoft music software Musicmatch was discontinued and iTunes became available for Windows making the iPod compatible with Windows.\nFourth Generation.\nThe fourth generation iPod was released on July 19, 2004 and had the click wheel from the iPod Mini. A 20GB iPod was available for $299 and a 40GB iPod for $399. The iPod casing was also slightly slimmer and rounder.\nA special Harry Potter edition iPod was released on September 7, 2005 which featured the hogwarts logo on the back and all 6 harry potter audiobooks on iTunes already on the iPod.\niPod Photo.\nAn special iPod called the iPod Photo was released on October 26, 2004. It has a color screen and the ability to connect the iPod to a TV and display a slideshow. The iPod could hold JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and PNG photo types.\niPod Color.\nOn June 28, 2005 the iPod Photo was merged into the normal iPod line adding a color screen and the ability to display photos to the iPod 4G.\nFifth Generation.\nThe fifth generation iPod was released on October 12, 2005 after the iPod Nano was released. As well as the \"Signature iPod White\" color, a black iPod was also released. This is the first iPod to be able to play videos. A 30GB iPod was available for $299 and a 60GB iPod for $399. This is the last iPod to have a plastic body. The sixth generation has a metal body.\nOn September 12, 2006 an upgraded version of the iPod 5G was released. It featured a brighter screen and longer video playback. The 60GB model was replaced with an 80GB model and the prices were dropped by $50 for both models.\nSixth Generation.\nThe sixth generation iPod was renamed iPod Classic and was released on September 5, 2007. A 80GB iPod was available for $249 and a 160GB iPod for $349. The \"Signature White iPod\" has also been replaced with a silver iPod and the iPod now has a metal body.\nAn upgraded version of the sixth gen iPod was released on September 9, 2008. The 80 and 160GB iPods were replaced with a thinner 120GB iPod for $249. It introduced Genius and audio recording features.\nAnother upgraded version of the sixth gen iPod was released on September 9, 2009. The 120GB iPod's price was dropped to $229 and the now thinner 160GB iPod was re-introduced for $249. The 120GB iPod was later discontinued so the only option left is the 160GB iPod."}

Caprivi was German Chancellor from March 1890 to October 1894.\nBiography.\nBorn in Charlottenburg, Berlin to a family of Italian and Slovenian origin, Caprivi joined the army in 1849 and fought in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.\nHe liked Bismarck, and once said \"What jackass would dare to succeed Bismarck?\". Kaiser Wilhelm II was arguing with Bismarck about changes to the government. In February 1890 the Kaiser told Caprivi to come back to Berlin. Caprivi was told that he would take over from Bismarck if Bismarck did not do what the Kaiser wanted. Caprivi became chancellor on 18 March 1890.\nCaprivi's government was friendlier to the Social Democrats and to the United Kingdom. The Zanzibar treaty of July 1890, meant Germany gave control of Zanzibar, an island near German East Africa to Britain in return for the island of Heligoland in the North Sea . Caprivi also got the Caprivi Strip added to German South West Africa. This is a narrow strip of land that links German South West Africa (now called Namibia), to the Zambezi River.\nIn 1892 Caprivi resigned as Prussian Minister President and was replaced by Count Botho zu Eulenburg. Prussia was so powerful in the German Empire that having different people as Imperial Chancellor and Minister President made it hard to govern the country. Caprivi and Eulenburg were dismissed in 1894 and Prince Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst took both jobs."}

He (or she) will expect to be paid a professional fee for the job.\nThe word \u201camateur\u201d comes from a French word meaning: \"lover of\". An amateur is someone who does something (e.g. play the piano, football) because they enjoy doing it. They are not doing it in order to be paid. It is not how they earn money to live.\nPeople often forget the real meaning of the word \u201camateur\u201d. It is often mistakenly used to mean: someone who is not good at something. On the other hand, an amateur might be described as having done a very \u201cprofessional\u201d job, i.e. done it as well as someone who is paid.\nAlthough one might expect a professional to be better than an amateur, this is not always the case. Someone might be a very good amateur pianist, possibly better than some professionals.\nIn some jobs it would be impossible for amateurs to be allowed to work. One cannot have amateur doctors or lawyers. In some areas, however, amateurs have been very useful, e.g. in computer programming or astronomy or birdwatching.

Many events mix professional and amateur participants. \nIn some sports (e.g. tennis or football) in the past, amateurs and professionals would not compete against one another. This was not always because amateurs were thought to be not as good as professionals. In some countries, such as Great Britain in Victorian times, this was because of social class distinction. Amateur cricketers were rich gentlemen from the upper classes who did not want to associate with people from lower classes.

Many people go for a jog in order to keep fit and healthy. People go jogging for exercise, not for competitions.\nJogging is a very cheap way of keeping fit, because all that is needed is a good pair of running shoes. One can jog anywhere, although it is good to stay away from main roads where the air is full of traffic fumes. It is also good to avoid too much jogging on hard pavements (sidewalks). A softer surface such as grass is better for jogging because there is less hard jolting for the knees.\nJogging is a kind of aerobic exercise which helps people breathe better. It can keep the heart rate at a high-speed level for a long time (depends on how long people spend). A goal of aerobic exercise is to train the different types of muscles so people can keep fit by increasing the muscle mass. Since people increase the muscle mass, they can be successful to increase the lean level and decrease the body fat. In this way, people can keep fit and be healthy.\nJogging and running have very popular in the late 20th century. People of all ages jog. It promotes strength and good condition and is useful to people who want to control their weight. Like other aerobic exercise, it releases endorphin in many people. \nLocations.\nJogging has different perspective come up to consider when someone are planning work out. This surface has both positive and negative, as well as work in different muscle groups. The personal trainer can offer the best way should be using, training for a race like flat and track can help to keep Achilles tendon for became stretched position. Road force has negative at the road force because people need to be careful of the busy traffic during the exercising.\nChanging the jogging surface could help in training intensity level when painful comes up to hurt on bones and other joints. Here are the positive and negative of jogging at sidewalk: Jogging at sidewalks is a \u00a0very good selection and safe to keep clear from the busy road and a must to escape. However, it\u2019s also the hardest surface to exercise on. It is a good idea to stay off this surface is when your knees or ankles pain.\nChallenges in jogging make people increases bone density, decreasing of heart disease. it is helping to strengths, forces legs, and body muscles. Also, improves cardiovascular health, making down of heart disease by assists in reducing body fat percentage that could improve circulation. It could improve both protected functions and cuts out stress by dropping \u00a0endorphins in the brain.\nAs a exercise.\nJogging is also known as a long-standing exercise; no matter what the age is, you can enjoy jogging as well. The option of where can people admire jogging is very extensive, it can be anywhere that makes people feel comfortable, such as at the park, on the track, at the beach, on the mountain, on a jogging path or even on a machine. The great benefits of jogging include stress relief, lifestyle disease prevention, makes the function of heart and lung stronger and builds strong bones. These kinds of interest can support the body's operation and help people stay healthy.\nHealth effects.\nJogging can improve overall health, it is really good for fitness level, \u00a0weight control, and strength of bones. It can change body composition for the better now, legs and hip muscle will grow stronger with the new body process; it helps strengthen the heart and lungs.

It is a popular hobby. Someone who does this may be called a birdwatcher, but more often a twitcher or birder. They are usually amateurs. The scientific study of birds is called ornithology. People who study birds as a profession are called ornithologists.\nBirdwatching is very popular in countries such as Britain and the United States. It can be especially rewarding in spring when a lot of birds are singing and building nests to raise their young. In spring and autumn many birds can be seen as they migrate. In winter some other kinds of birds may be visiting from colder areas such as the Arctic where there is no food in the winter.\nEquipment.\nIt is useful to have a good pair of binoculars to help to see birds that are far away more clearly. Scopes or telescopes can also be used. These can give greater magnification than binoculars (making the birds look bigger). They need to put on a tripod because it is difficult to hold them steady steady by hand. They are useful for looking at birds that stay in one place for some time such as ducks swimming on a lake, but no use for birds flying in the air or hopping quickly from one tree to another. \nMany birders like to take photographs of birds. This is difficult to do well unless one has good, expensive cameras and long lenses. Telescopes can be attached to cameras. This is called digiscoping. Modern phone cameras are very useful, and can produce good results. They are easier to use in many situations. But those who do use telescopes may need a \"hide\", usually a canvas tent. A hide means the birds cannot see you, and it keeps you warmer than being out in the open. Water birds are usually photographed from hides.\nAlso important is to have a good reference book with pictures of the birds in your country. This is call a \"field guide\". It tells you background information about the birds, which can be very useful. Apart from what they look like, the most basic information is what time of year they are in your area, and what kind of environment they prefer. Also they will tell you what the birds' songs and calls sound like. You will discover that it often takes a long time to find a bird even when you know it is there from its song.\nSongs and calls.\nSongs are longer and more complex. They claim territory and are used in courtship and mating. Calls tend to be alarms or keeping members of a flock in contact. Most birds are songbirds. Those which are not give squawks or cries, which are like calls. \nBird watching.\nBirdwatching (twitching) means spending one\u2019s time trying to see as many different kinds of birds as possible. Twitchers keep lists of all the birds they have seen, and if they hear that a rare bird has been seen somewhere, they travel long distances to try to see it so that they can add it to their list.\nBirdwatchers are useful.\nAlthough birdwatchers are amateurs, they can be very useful, because they can tell organizations about what they have seen. This is one kind of citizen science. This information can be useful when discussions take place about possible damage to the environment, e.g. because of new developments (building). It can help us to protect the birds, because we understand their needs. Some birders help with bird ringing. Putting a ring on a bird\u2019s foot helps us to identify it when it is seen again so that we can understand where birds go and what they do. Birders can also take part in bird counts. In Britain a \u201cBig Garden Birdwatch\u201d project takes place one weekend each year in late January. Over 400,000 people watch the birds in their gardens for one hour and are asked to make a list of how many they see during this time. By comparing the results with other years this helps us to see which birds are surviving well, and which ones are becoming less common.\nCode of behaviour.\nBirders are always reminded how important it is not to disturb the birds. This is particularly important in the nesting season. If birds are nesting on the ground in fields or reedbeds one should never go anywhere near them. Some birds get used to humans being near, but others are very shy of humans.\nOrganizations.\nSome national organizations which are concerned with birds include:"}

He was the son of Ernest I, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Anhalt. He was a clever child, and liked science, reading and mathematics.\nHe married Queen Victoria, his first cousin, on 10 February 1840. The wedding was held at St. James's Palace, the queen's official home in London. Both Victoria and Albert were deeply in love with each other. However, the queen kept Albert out of politics; he was not allowed to take part in the government of the country. In the end, this changed, and Albert often gave advice to the Prime Minister of the time.\nAlbert and Victoria had nine children together. Albert's favourite child was his first, Victoria, who became Queen of Prussia and Empress of Germany, in 1871. When his second child, Albert Edward (the future king Edward VII) was born in 1841, he took an active interest in his education. The two were never close, and Albert often overworked his elder son. \nAlbert came up with the idea of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London. The exhibition was meant to show Britain's industrial strength. It was a great success, and improved his popularity in England. It was held in the Crystal Palace, a huge glass and iron building. It burnt down in 1936, long after it had been moved from Hyde Park and rebuilt in a part of south London now called Crystal Palace. \nIn 1861, Albert caught a fever, whilst travelling to Cambridge to see his son. The fever was typhoid, a disease which was common in the 19th century. Like cholera, it was a disease of water contaminated by faecal bacteria. He died at Windsor Castle, on the 14 December 1861. Queen Victoria was very upset, and she spent the next forty years of her reign in mourning her dead husband. She avoided public appearances and rarely set foot in London in the following years. Her contribution to government was little in that long period after the death of her husband. It was during that long period when Germany and the United States transformed their countries so that, in the 20th century, Britain was no longer the leading country of the world, but just one of several leading countries. In the 19th century the monarch was an important part of government, and most countries still had monarchs."}

It was known as just simply Berlin in East Germany, the country it served as the capital of. It was the Soviet sector of Berlin that was established in 1945. The American, British and French sectors became West Berlin, a \"de facto\" part of West Germany. Although it was always legally a part of an occupied city, East Berlin was claimed as the capital of East Germany. From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989 it was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall. The East German government referred to East Berlin simply as \"Berlin\" or often \"\"Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR\" (Berlin, capital of the GDR). The term \"Democratic Sector\" was also used until the 1960s.\nThe Western Allies (the USA, Great Britain and France) only recognized the power of the Soviet Union in East Berlin in accordance with the occupation status of Berlin as a whole. The three Western commandants regularly protested about the presence of the East German National People's Army (NPA) in East Berlin.\nNevertheless, the three Western Allies eventually established embassies in East Berlin in the 1970s, although they never recognized it as East Germany's capital. Treaties instead used terms such as \"seat of government.\" In the 1960s the Western Allies sometimes said the capital of East Germany was Pankow. Pankow is the borough where the main East German government buildings were built.\nOn 3 October 1990, West Germany and East Germany were united, and East Berlin ceased to exist.\nEast Berlin today.\nSince reunification, the German government has spent lots of money on rejoining the two halves of the city and bringing services and buildings in the former East Berlin up to the standard in West Berlin. There are still differences between eastern and western Berlin. There are a lot more pre-war buildings in Eastern Berlin, some still show signs of wartime damage. The style of architecture used in the whole of the GDR was very different from that used in rebuilding West Berlin too.\nIn many East German cities streets were named after socialist heroes. Many were changed after reunification, but some, such as Karl-Marx-Allee, Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz and Karl-Liebknecht-Stra\u00dfe have been kept.\nOne way anyone could tell if they were in the old East Berlin or in West Berlin was by looking at the traffic lights. East Berlin used special designs on their pedestrian traffic lights, called \"Ampelm\u00e4nnchen\". The Berlin government wanted to abolish the East German signals, but lots of people objected, and now Ampelm\u00e4nnchen are being seen in West Berlin too.\nBoroughs of East Berlin.\nAt the time of German reunification, East Berlin comprised the boroughs of"}

It is in Milan, Italy, which is the country where opera started at the beginning of the 17th century. The theatre opened on 3 August 1778. At first it was called \"Nuovo Regio Ducal Teatro alla Scala\". The first opera to be performed there was Salieri's \"Europa riconosciuta\".\nBuilding of the theatre.\nThere had been a theatre there before, called Teatro Ducale, but it had been destroyed by fire in 1776. The new theatre was built where there had been a church called Santa Maria della Scala. This is how the theatre got its name.\nThe theatre had more than 3,000 seats arranged in six tiers (six storeys) of boxes, and above that the two 'loggione' or galleries. It has a very large stage. The money for the building was found by selling the 'palchi' (boxes) to wealthy noblemen and other rich people in Milan. In the 'platea' (the main floor) there were no seats and the audience there stood up to watch, like they do today in the Royal Albert Hall at the Proms. The orchestra could be seen very well as they were not in an orchestra pit like they are today.\nAbove the boxes, La Scala has always had a gallery where people who are not so rich can watch. This is still there today. It is called the \"loggione\". Some people in the loggione, known as the Claque, are known to applaud wildly if they like a singer, or boo loudly if they do not like a singer. During La Scala\u2019s history this has often been because of bribery or blackmail.\nLa Scala was originally lit with 84 oil lamps mounted on the \"palcoscenico\" (ceiling) and another thousand in the rest of theater. In case they ever caught fire, several rooms were filled with hundreds of water buckets. Later, oil lamps were replaced by gas lamps. In 1883 electric lights were put in.\nThe building was renovated in 1907. After that it had 2,800 seats as it does today. In 1943, during World War II, La Scala was badly damaged by bombing. It was rebuilt and reopened on 11 May 1946, with a brilliant concert conducted by Arturo Toscanini, with a soprano solo by Renata Tebaldi.\nVerdi.\nMany famous operas were first performed at La Scala, including some by Giuseppe Verdi. For several years, however, Verdi did not allow his music to be played here because he did not like the way the orchestra had played it. However the composer later conducted his \"Requiem\" there on May 25, 1874, and in 1886 announced that La Scala would host the premiere of his opera \"Otello\". The first performance of his last opera, \"Falstaff\" was also given in this theatre.\nToday.\nLa Scala's season traditionally opens on 7 December, Saint Ambrose's Day, Milan's patron saint. All performances must end before midnight; long operas start earlier in the evening if necessary.\nThere is also a La Scala Museum (Museo Teatrale alla Scala) which has an extraordinary collection of paintings, drafts, statues, costumes, and other documents about opera and La Scala's history.\nRecently there have been more renovations to La Scala. Some people were worried that it would spoil the historic building, but the opera company were very pleased when the work was done. There was a new stage and lots more room behind the stage. The heavy red carpets were taken away and the sound was better. The seats include monitors so that the audience can follow the words in English or Italian if it is in a foreign language (not Italian).\nThe renovated opera house was opened on 7 December 2004 with the same opera by Salieri that had opened it in 1778. The conductor was Riccardo Muti."}

It was a celebration of modern industrial technology and design. \nIts prime motive was for \"Great Britain [to make] clear to the world its role as an industrial leader\". Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort, was an enthusiastic promoter of the exhibition, which was self-financing. Queen Victoria and her family visited three times. \nTechnology and moving machinery was popular, especially working exhibits. Visitors could watch the entire process of cotton production from spinning to finished cloth. Scientific instruments included electric telegraphs, microscopes, air pumps and barometers, as well as musical, horological and surgical instruments.\nThe Crystal Palace.\nA special building, The Crystal Palace, was built to house the show. It took the form of a massive glass house, 1851 feet (about 564 metres) long by 454 feet (about 138 metres) wide. It was built with a cast iron-frame and glass. It was made almost entirely in Birmingham and Smethwick.\nIt was designed by Joseph Paxton with support from structural engineer Charles Fox. The committee which oversaw its construction included Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The building was architecturally adventurous. Paxton's had experience designing greenhouses for William Cavendish, the 6th Duke of Devonshire. \nThe Crystal Palace was an enormous success. It was an architectural marvel, but also an engineering triumph which showed the importance of the Exhibition itself. The building was later moved and re-erected in an enlarged form at Sydenham in south London, an area that was renamed \"Crystal Palace\". The building was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936."}

It was conquered in 928 by the German King Henry I, but returns to Slavic rule later in the 10th century.\nThe first written mention of Spandau was in 1197. It was given City rights in 1232.\nThe Spandau Citadel was completed in 1594 by Joachim II of Brandenburg. In 1558 the village of Gatow became part of Spandau. Spandau was surrendered to the Swedes in 1634.\nIn 1806, after the Battle of Jena and Auerstedt, French troops under Napoleon took possession of the city and stayed there until 1807.

Peterborough's population growth was the fastest of any British city over the ten years from 2002. This was partly due to immigration.\nBecause the city is still getting larger, the city council has passed a law for a new development plan. This is to add an additional 22,000 homes, 18,000 jobs and over 40,000 people who will live in Peterborough by 2020. The newly developing Hampton township will be finished.

It is important to make sure that the vehicle is parked somewhere where parking is allowed, otherwise the driver may have to pay a fine, or even worse, the vehicle may be clamped. Cars are usually parked in driveways, parking lots, garages, or on the side of the street.\nParking a car is easier than parking a large vehicle such as a lorry (truck) or a coach. These large vehicles often have to go to special parks. Rules about parking are part of traffic rules, and these will vary a lot from one country to another. It is illegal to park on the sidewalk\nParking a vehicle.\nWhen driving along a road, the driver may see a space big enough for him to park his vehicle. He should stop just after he has passed the space, alongside the next car, then reverse (go backwards) slowly in, aiming towards the curb, then turning the steering wheel so that he just misses the car in front. Then he can adjust, leaving equal room between the two cars. This process is called \"parallel parking\". If the space is wide enough for two cars he can drive forwards into the space instead of reversing in. Parking correctly takes practice and some experience. The driver should not ram or scrub a wheel against the curb. This can puncture the tire.\nPlaces to park.\nOn the road.\nVehicles can often be parked at the side of the road. They are usually parked parallel to the curb at the edge of the pavement or sidewalk. In some places, parking spaces may be set at a slight 45 degree angle to the curb. Sometimes there are no restrictions: one can park there, free, for as long as one likes. \nIn other places, parking may not be allowed at all (e.g. where there are double yellow lines (in Britain) or it may be allowed only for limited periods. Parking is not allowed on streets where building construction is in progress. Parking may not be allowed on streets that must be open to emergency traffic such as ambulances and fire trucks. Parking may not be allowed in the winter on certain streets that are marked \"snow route\". These routes must be clear of vehicles so snow plows can get through to do their job.\nDrivers may have to pay to park. Money can either be put in parking meters which are to be found by every parking bay. There may be a machine nearby where the driver has to pay, and then he receives a ticket which he has to leave inside the car to show that he has paid. The time and date of arrival will be printed on the ticket.\nClamping and towing.\nIf a driver does not pay, or he stays longer than he is allowed, he may be given a parking ticket by a traffic warden, a policeman, or a meter maid. These people have the job of patrolling the streets and finding any cars which are illegally parked. A ticket is issued. A fine must be paid.\nIn some cities, the cars may be clamped or \"booted\" (in the US). This means that a heavy clamp (\"boot\") is fixed to one of the wheels. The car cannot be driven away. The driver then has to phone the clamping firm to arrange for them to unlock the clamp. This will cost a lot of money. \nIn some places, the car may be taken away by the police. They will take it to a special parking lot under police control. The vehicle is lifted by a crane onto a lorry and taken away. It may be taken away by a tow truck. It costs a lot of money to get one's car back.\nCar parks and parking lots.\nCar parks (or, parking lots) are spaces where one can park and leave one's car. The size of these spaces can range from very small to very large. They can be paved with asphalt, concrete, or other material. They can be covered with gravel, or simply bare earth. \nIn urban areas, car parks are usually paved. Slots for cars are measured out and are painted on the pavement. Drivers are expected to park within these slots. Cars are usually parked side by side in a car park.\nThere may be an attendant on duty who will collect a flat fee for parking or issue a ticket noting the driver's arrival time. The fee will be collected when the driver leaves. Sometimes the driver can get the ticket from a mechanical device at the entrance. He will pay the fee when he leaves to an attendant typically stationed in a small booth at the exit. \nCar parks and parking lots can be dangerous to drivers and their passengers. Some are not (or poorly) lit at night. Persons intent on mischief or criminal activity can operate without being seen. Large parks and lots attract both male and female prostitutes who, if turned away, may retaliate in some way such as \"keying\" a vehicle. Other hazards in urban lots are rusty nails on the pavement, broken glass, and vermin such as rats. \nAt a country fair, barn sale, a country concert, or other rural event, drivers may park their vehicles in a meadow that has been mowed and marked off with ropes or bales of hay to guide drivers in and out of the area. An attendant is usually stationed at the entrance to advise drivers on where to park. There is sometimes (but not usually) a fee charged for parking in such an area. A \"Park and Ride\" is a big car park on the edge of a town. Instead of driving into the centre of the town, drivers can park there and take a bus or tram into the centre.\nAnother type of car park, called an \"attendant car park\" is one where the driver leaves the car keys with an attendant. The attendant will then drive the car and park it so that all the cars are bunched up close to one another. This saves space. This type of car park is common at airports. The driver can tell the attendant when he expects to be back.\nSome car parks are private car parks. They can only be used by people who are visiting the hotel, store or firm to whom the car park belongs. People who park there illegally may find that their vehicle gets clamped, towed, or booted.\nOn a busy highway, an area just off the main road is available for parking. These are called layovers or rest areas. Sometimes there is a curb. Sometimes there is a rest room or vending machines for drinks and snacks. Sometimes there are full-scale restaurants and souvenir shops. Parking is risky. These areas typically are not supervised and are often the haunt of criminals such as prostitutes and drug dealers. Homosexuals gather in these areas to \"do their thing\" and often attract the attention of the police.\nDisabled parking.\nSome car parks have a few spaces that are reserved for disabled people. These spaces are usually near the exit of the car park or near the front doors of the store, hotel, restaurant etc. This is a convenience for the disabled driver or passenger. The disabled person is able to get into and out of the store or restaurant with little difficulty. These disabled spaces are usually limited to a few slots that are clearly marked. \nThe disabled spaces are usually wider than the others so that the vehicle doors can be opened wide for the disabled person to get out. It is important to display a valid disabled badge or other insignia in or on the vehicle. This will alert store owners and tow drivers that the car is legally parked. Able drivers should not park in these disabled slots. They risk being towed or fined.\nParking garages.\nParking garages (or multi-level car parks) are buildings of concrete and steel. They are used for parking vehicles. Some are built on downtown city streets where on-street parking slots may be limited. Parking garages are usually several levels high. The levels are connected by ramps. Many parking garages are open to the weather. They can be cold, snowy, and windy in the winter. Sometimes the street level of a parking garage has shops, cafes, and other businesses.\nA driver goes into the garage at an entrance. He takes a ticket stamped with his arrival time from an attendant or a mechanical device. He may drive up several ramps to find a parking space. He leaves his ticket in the car where the attendant can see it. When he leaves, he rolls down his window and pays the parking fee at the exit. A barrier is lifted, and he drives away. \nParking garages can be dangerous for drivers and their passengers. These buildings are sometimes dimly lit, poorly staffed, and not always watched for potential trouble. There are places in a parking garage for anyone intent on mischief or criminal activity to hide or escape. Enclosed stairways and elevators (lifts) can be dangerous, especially for someone alone. \nParking garages are sometimes found near office buildings, hospitals, universities, police stations, and other busy places where land space is limited. Some apartment buildings have their own parking garages. These are for use by tenants in the apartment building. Some buildings have underground parking garages. Once again these garages are to be used solely by residents, employees, and customers."}

It was built in the 12th century. It stands on the top of a very high hill overlooking the town of Bamberg. It can be seen from nearly all directions. Bamberg is built on seven hills, each with a building at the top. The hill on which the St Michael\u2019s Church stands is the highest one. An old, cobbled road with some ancient houses leads from the cathedral up to the church. Not far beyond the church are fields and woods.\nThe church is built in the Romanesque style. It used to be the church of a Benedictine monastery. The monastery was secularized in 1803. There is now an almshouse there as well as a museum and municipal art collections.\nHistory.\nEmperor Heinrich II (Henry II) was the founder of the Bishopric of Bamberg. The first bishop of Bamberg was Eberhard, who founded the abbey of St Michael. It belonged to the bishop. The abbot had to obey the bishop. The monks who came to live there came from the towns of Amorbach and Fulda.\nIn the 12th century the abbey flourished. This was the time of Bishop Otto of Bamberg. The abbey started to become more independent of the bishop.\nThe abbey went through hard times during the wars around 1525. In the 17th and 18th centuries it went through better times again. When the bishops lost their political power in 1803 the abbey started to belong to the town. The people asked for the almshouses in the town to be moved to the St Michael abbey. There is still a home for old people there today.\nInside the church.\nBehind the altar is the tomb of Bishop Otto of Bamberg which dates from 1443. There is a hole in the middle of the tomb which is just big enough for a person to crawl through. Visitors to the church like to crawl through the hole, because it is said that it helps people who have backache.\nThe roof of the nave has paintings of 580 different kinds of plants. These include plants from faraway countries, e.g. pineapple, cotton, pomegranate and tobacco as well as plants that are found locally. The paintings date from the 17th century. Many of the plants were grown in the herb gardens around the church.\nIn the side isles of the church the ceiling has more paintings. These include paintings of birds."}

He is one of Germany\u2019s top chefs, as well as being a writer, restaurateur, TV cook and businessman.\nBorn as \"Alfons Karg\", he trained as a telecommunications engineer, but was not happy. When he stopped at the Bavarian holiday resort of Waging, he ran into the restaurateur Sebastian Schuhbeck. He began working for Schuhbeck, and Sebastian Schubeck later adopted Alfons, and made him his heir.\nAlfons quickly became a very good chef. The village inn he worked at soon became a favourite restaurant of the richer people of Munich and Salzburg.\nHe did more training in Salzburg, Geneva, Paris, London and Munich as well as Feinkost K\u00e4fer, Dallmayr and in the \"Restaurant Aubergine\" of Eckart Witzigmann. He also studied at the College of Hotel Management in Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria. He finally took over the Kurhausst\u00fcberl in Waging in 1980.\nIn 1983 he got a star in the Michelin Guide. The Gault Millau restaurant guide gave him 17 points and in 1989 he was elected cook of the year.\nSince 1990 Schubeck has operated an outside catering service, which has catered for many high-class events like the Federal Chancellor\u2019s celebration, the Ball des Sports and the German music industry\u2019s \"ECHO\" award ceremony.\nIn 2003 he opened a new restaurant, the \"S\u00fcdtiroler Stuben\" at the Platzl in Munich. In December of that year he was won his second Michelin star, and in November 2005 he was awarded got a star once again in December 2003, the Five Star Diamond Award by the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences.\nHis great popularity has resulted in his publishing over 20 books, as well as many TV shows. Bayerischer Rundfunk has broadcast his programme \"Schuhbecks\" since 1993, and he remains a regular guest in many talk and other TV shows.\nScandal.\nDuring the 1990s Schuhbeck had DM 60 million for capital investments. Because he was the only person in charge of millions of DM in Monte Carlo, Monaco Schuhbeck was taken to court on the suspicion of fraud. Although unusual, what he did was not illegal, and he was exonerated.\nBusinesses.\nAt the end of the 1990s he set up Schuhbecks GmbH at the Platzl. This company now includes the restaurant Schuhbeck, a wine bistro, the party service, a cookery school, a spice shop and an ice-cream parlour. These are all based in Munich.

Tanning makes the skin tougher and often changes its color. Tanning helps make the animal skin become more flexible and less vulnerable to bacteria damage.\nBefore tanning an animal skin, the animal must be killed and skinned before the body heat of the animal leaves the animal's body. Next, tissue on the inside of the skin and hairs on the outside are removed. Salt in the skin is removed and the skins are soaked in water ffor six hours to two days.\nThe actual process of tanning is done by soaking the leather in a bath of Chromium III sulphate ([Cr(H2O)6]2(SO4)3). In past centuries a natural substance called tannin was used, which was got from oak or fir trees.\nThe whole process is very smelly, and tanneries are often placed at the edges of towns. The runoff from tanning plants into rivers is a major cause of pollution. This can be prevented by methods of water treatment adapted to the outflow of tannery liquids. Developing countries may lack this methodology, even though World Bank grants are available for water treatment facilities. A private-sector trade association may give technical information about clean technologies.\nA tanner is someone whose job is tanning. \nA tannery is the place where the tanners worked with the animal skins."}

Also, some people who have businesses in the town (especially filling stations and restaurants) may think that they will not get so many customers.\nIf there are no strong rules that control the use of land, buildings are built along a bypass, making it an ordinary town road so that it might become just as busy as a town street again.\nA road that goes all the way around the town in a large circle is called a ring road.

It did two main things. First, it issued a list (the Index) of published books banned because they contained heresy. The faithful were forbidden to read such books. Second, it prosecuted individuals thought guilty of heresy.\nLater versions of the Inquisitions had the power to use torture or the threat of torture to get confessions and religious conversions. It had the power to order executions. The standard method was to burn heretics alive, or to strangle them in public. The actual deed was done by the civil authorities.\nThe full name of the Inquisition was the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith () of the Catholic Church. It developed in stages. The first permanent Inquisition was established in 1229. It was run by the Dominicans in Rome. In 1478 Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile set up the Spanish Inquisition.\nIn 1542 Pope Paul III established the Congregation of the Holy Office of the Inquisition as a tribunal staffed with cardinals and other officials. This version supervised the local Inquisitions in other countries, and also investigated important cases from Italy. The most famous case it tried was that of Galileo Galilei in 1633.\nThe word Inquisition comes from Latin \"quaerere\". That means \"to turn\", \"to ask a question\"."}

It is the capital of the province of Punjab. It is also known as the 'City of Gardens' because of its many parks and gardens. This city is known for its rich culture and lively atmosphere. Pakistan's major Urdu film industry Lollywood is based here at the \"Cultural Heart of Pakistan\". It is 60\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) west of Amritsar, India. It has a semi-arid climate (\"BSh\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification).\nOrigins.\nAccording to legend, the city was founded thousands of years ago by Lava or Lav, son of the deity Rama (hero of the Ramayana). Its original name was either 'Lav-garh' (Fort of Lav/Lava) or 'Lavapuri' (Place of Lava/Lav) which was later changed to 'Lavhur' or 'Lahor' and then 'Lahore'.\nAccording to historians and archaeologists, Lahore was the capital of several Hindu dynasties from around 300-250 BC onwards. Probably the first of these dynasties was the 'Loh'(or Lav) dynasty of the Gujar tribe. Some people also believe that this city is the same one mentioned by Ptolemy in his \"Geographia\".\nThe ancient 'Walled City' was the old, proper Lahore, which later expanded in different directions. Quite a lot of work was done on it by the kings of the Delhi Sultanate and then the Mughals. Most of the newer areas and suburbs of the city are from the later British Raj from 1849 to 1947.\nHistorical importance.\nLahore is historically an important place in the South Asian Subcontinent. Famous buildings made here during the time of the Mughal Empire include the Badshahi Mosque, the Lahore Fort and the Shalimar Gardens. It was capital of the Sikh Empire of the early 19th century. Many of the city's old artifacts and historical treasures over the ages, can be seen at the famous Lahore Museum built later in the 19th century during British Indian rule.\nLahore is also important due to its role as a center of the Pakistan Movement later, and the famous Lahore Resolution of 1940 was passed here by the Working Committee of the All-India Muslim League, which eventually led to the making of an independent state of Pakistan in 1947. This event is commemorated by the Minar-e-Pakistan building in Iqbal Park. \nTo the north of Lahore, near the Ravi River, lies the old suburb of Shah Dara, which is also considered to be historically significant, as the tombs of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir and his wife Nur Jahan, are situated here. According to the early English traveler, Thomas Coryat, who visited Lahore in its 'Golden Age' during the reign of Jahangir, it was probably the finest city in the world at that time, and 'exceedeth evene Constantinople in greatnesse' (It was even greater than Constantinople).\nEducation.\nLahore is Pakistan's top educational center. The old University of the Punjab has two campuses in the city. Other old and famous institutions of higher learning include the Government College University (GCU), the Forman Christian College and the Kinnaird College for Women. The National College of Arts, a specialized fine arts institute, is also located here.\nThe city is also home to Pakistan's most prestigious high school and college, the Aitchison College Lahore. Other institutions include the Central Model School, St Anthony's School, the Beaconhouse School System, Lahore College of Arts and Sciences (LACAS) and the Lahore Grammar School and the world famous King Edward Medical University is also located in Lahore.\nCultural life.\nLahore is Pakistan's cultural, literary and artistic heart. It has some of the best food in the whole Indian subcontinent at the Gawalmandi Food Street, near the old Walled City; and several notable cultural centers like the Alhamra Theatre, the Punjab Arts Council, the Lahore Museum, the Shakir Ali Museum, the Fakir Khana museum and the Rafi Peer Theatre Group. The Lawrence Gardens, Lahore are another site from British times that is worth visiting. The famed Heera Mandi in the old Taxali Gate area is also a part of Lahore's historic culture. The Anarkali Bazaar is also a great place for traditional shopping.\nLahore is also important in Pakistan as a center of cultural and religious tolerance. The city does not have many religious fanatics or extremists, unlike some other parts of this country. The main reason is because of the strong influence of many famous Sufi saints who lived here in the past. The shrines (burial places) of some of them are still visited by many people. The shrines of Hazrat Daata Sahib and Mian Mir Sahib are specially famous. "}

Aldeburgh is in Suffolk in the south-east of England. It is where the composer Benjamin Britten lived with his friend the tenor Peter Pears. A lot of Britten\u2019s music is played at the festival, but music by many other composers can be heard as well. Most of the concerts take place in the Maltings, a concert hall in the village of Snape, not far away from Aldeburgh.\nHistory of the Aldeburgh Festival.\nThe Festival was started in 1948 by Benjamin Britten, Peter Pears and the librettist Eric Crozier. They started the festival so that the English Opera Group would have a place to perform their operas, but soon the festival became bigger. There were poetry readings, drama performances, lectures and art exhibitions. The first festival was mostly held in Aldeburgh Jubilee Hall, a few doors away from Britten's house in Crabbe Street. His opera \"Albert Herring\" was performed, as well as his \"St Nicolas Cantata\".\nOver the years the festival grew. Some of the performances took place in the church, or in churches or other halls in nearby villages and small towns such as Orford and Framlingham. However, the festival needed a large concert hall. In the 1960s the old malthouse (where barley used to be made) in Snape was changed into a concert hall. It was opened by the Queen on 2 June 1967, at the start of the twentieth Aldeburgh Festival. \nTwo years later, on the first night of the 1969 Festival, the concert hall was destroyed by fire. Only the main walls remained. For that year the Festival was moved to other local places, but by the next year the hall had been rebuilt and once again it was opened by the Queen, this time at the start of the 1970 Festival.\nThe Festival today.\nThe festival is now organized by Aldeburgh Music, which also runs the Britten-Pears Young Artist Programme which gives young musicians a chance to learn from famous music teachers and perform in concerts.\nThe festival has a nice atmosphere because it is in the country near the sea and marshes. New music is often performed. In the past there have been first performances of several works by Britten: (\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" in 1960; \"Death in Venice\" in 1973) and also Harrison Birtwistle's \"Punch and Judy\" in 1968.\nThe Festival's Artistic Director is now the composer Thomas Ad\u00e8s, who was appointed in 1999."}

He then studied music at Keble College, Oxford. He was organist at Hertford College, Oxford but left Oxford without taking his degree. He later studied singing for two terms at the Royal College of Music.\nHe met Britten in 1934, when he was a member of the BBC Singers. Pears and Britten gave their first recital together in 1937 at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1939 they went to America together because of World War II. However, in 1942 they decided to return to their own country. Back in England they performed Britten's song cycle \"Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo\" together at the Wigmore Hall in London (Britten was an excellent pianist), and then recorded them for EMI, their first recording together.\nPeter Pears was a great inspiration for Britten\u2019s vocal writing. Many of Britten's operas have a main tenor role which was written for Pears to sing. Britten also wrote over 100 songs with piano accompaniment. Britten also wrote works for tenor and orchestra. These include \"Les Illuminations\", \"Nocturne\", the \"Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings\" and the Canticles. In Britten\u2019s operas he sang \"Peter Grimes\" and \"Albert Herring\" (title roles), \"The Beggar's Opera\" (Macheath), \"Owen Wingrave\" (Sir Philip Wingrave), \"Billy Budd\" (Captain Vere), \"The Turn of the Screw\" (Quint), \"Death in Venice\" (Aschenbach) and the three Church Parables.\nPears helped to write the words for \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", based on the Shakespeare play. In most of Britten\u2019s operas Pears sang serious roles, but in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream he had a comic role: the part of Flute the Bellowsmender. In this role he was dressed up as a female and did a parody of the great opera singer Joan Sutherland singing the mad scene from \"Lucia di Lammermoor \".\nPears\u2019s voice was a lyrical tenor, not a heavy, operatic one. Britten was extremely skilful in writing music for him which suited his voice very well. He sang regularly at the Royal Opera House and many other opera houses in Europe and the United States.\nHe was also a great singer of Franz Schubert's \"Lieder\", usually with Britten as accompanist, and he often sang the part of the Evangelist in Johann Sebastian Bach's Passions.\nHis last great role written for him by Britten was as Aschenbach in \"Death in Venice\". He sang this in 1973 at the Aldeburgh Festival, and the following year in the Royal Opera House. Britten by then had heart disease and was too ill to go to the performances, dying in 1976.\nPears continued to live in the Red House, Aldeburgh. After he retired from performing he continued to teach young singers at the Britten-Pears Foundation. He was awarded a CBE in 1955 and knighted in 1977.\nIn his last years Pears also suffered from heart disease. He died ten years after Britten. He is buried next to him in the churchyard of Saint Peter and Saint Paul's Church in Aldeburgh.\nThere are many recordings of Pears\u2019s singing including almost all the music that Britten wrote for him as well as the roles of the Evangelist in Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s \"St Matthew Passion\" and \"St John Passion \" and Gerontius in Elgar\u2019s \"Dream of Gerontius\"."}

It is not on the programme, although the performer may have secretly planned it. A performer will play an encore if the audience claps a lot. Sometimes the audience shout \"encore!\" when they want an encore. The word \"encore\" is the French word for \"again\".\nAn encore is usually a short piece. Often it is a fast piece to finish the performance off happily, but if a musician has just played a very energetic, loud piece, then the encore might be a quiet piece. A concert given by a solo performer or small group of performers is more likely to finish with an encore than a concert with an orchestra, but a lot depends on the tradition from one country to another."}

The English words \"key\" and \"quay\" (which means wharf) come from the old French \"kai\" meaning \"sand bank\". Because it is a Ta\u00edno word, \"cay\" (and the other forms) are used mainly in the Caribbean, but the type of island is found in the tropical seas where there are coral reefs.\nSand cays are built on the edge of the coral reefs, opposite the direction from which the wind blows most of the time. Because of that, cays are often elongated. Tides and wind (and sometimes sea birds) deposit coral debris. Weather affects the formation of cays greatly; large tides would bring much more debris onto the cay and thus make it larger, while a hurricane destroys a cay.\nSome cays are very large; Cayo Coco, north of Cuba, is about 370 km2. Those large cays are being used for tourism because they have beaches with white sand and the presence of coral reefs."}

They are lobe-finned fish, like the lungfish and coelacanths. They are a clade of bony fish which first appeared in the Silurian, 418 million years ago (mya). One line in this group gave rise to the tetrapods.\nCharacteristics.\nThese are bony fishes with paired rounded fins. These fins, being similar to limbs, suggest that these fish may be ancestors of land vertebrates. All sarcopterygians possess teeth covered with true enamel.\nAs a clade, the group includes all its descendants. This means it includes the Tetrapods, that is, all species of four-limbed vertebrates. The fin-limbs of sarcopterygiians are very similar to what people believe was the ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. The ancestors of tetrapods are to be found amongst the lobe-fins of the Devonian period. The term 'fishapod' is becoming used for this transitional group.\nEvolution.\nSarcopterygians and their relatives the Actinopterygii ('ray-finned fish') make up the super-class Osteichthyes, the 'bony fish', which have a bony skeleton rather than cartilage. Otherwise, there are vast differences in fin, respiratory, and circulatory structures between the Sarcopterygii and the Actinopterygii.\nThe first sarcopterygians, found in the uppermost Silurian (about 418 mya), closely resembled the Acanthodii, the 'spiny fish' which went extinct at the end of the Palaeozoic era. In the early\u2013middle Devonian (416\u2013385 mya), while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas, some sarcopterygians came into freshwater habitats.\nIn the early Devonian (416\u2013397 mya), the sarcopterygians split into two main lineages \u2014 the Coelacanths and the Rhipidistia. The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the late Devonian and Carboniferous, from 385 to 299 mya, as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic; coelacanths still live today in the oceans (genus \"Latimeria\").\nThe Rhipidistians, whose ancestors probably lived in the oceans near the river mouths (estuaries), left the ocean world and migrated into freshwater habitats. They in turn split into two major groups : the lungfish and the tetrapods. The lungfish evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs; they learned in the middle Devonian (397\u2013385 mya) how to live outside a water environment, using their stubby fins (proto-limbs) to walk on land and find new water if their waterhole was depleted, and their lungs to breathe air and get sufficient oxygen. The lungfish's greatest diversity was in the Triassic period; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left.\nThe first tetrapodomorphs, which included the gigantic rhizodonts, had the same general anatomy as the lungfish, who were their closest kin, but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the later Devonian epoch (385\u2013359 mya), with the appearance of tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates). Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs which survived after the Devonian.\nNon-tetrapod sarcopterygians continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era, suffering heavy losses during the Permian-Triassic extinction event (251 mya)."}

The title of brand was named after the founder (Adi from Adolf das from Dassler). A year later, the basic form of Adidas logo Three stripes was made. Adidas products are still being made today. The Adidas group makes 600 kinds of shoes and 1,500 kinds of clothings every season.\nLogos.\nAdidas has three types of logos, which are originals, sports performance, and sports style. Each type follows the product design concept and shared inspiration. They imply the features of lots of products.\nOriginals (Trefoil or Heritage).\nAdidas heritage line shows the combined design of sportism and lifestyle. With retrospecting 60s, products including clothes, shoes, bags, and other fashion items are reappearing. Heritage\u2019s logo Trefoil was developed based on the three stripes in 1971. With crossing the tree stripes which symbolize diversity of brand, the unique characteristic of logo is expressed geometrically. This was an innovation in the existing logo.\nSports performance.\nSports performance line shows the goods which contains its self-esteem as a professional sports brand. The logo with three stripes has been used constantly. And, in 1997, Adidas\u2018 creative director Peter Moore renobated the type. He wanted to keep important meanings of old one, but at the same time he needed new logo which can be applied to the modern design. From his hand, three stripes became to mean a mountain which symbolizes a challenge and an accomplishment. And the parallel lines of stripes express gradually the brand's goal.\nSports style.\nIt might be called \"collection line.\" This Adidas sports style has shown off its design which is made by Yohji Yamamoto. He designs shoes, clothes, and accessaries with future-oriented images. in 2001, the initial sports style logo symbolized the swiftly chaning world. The three stripes which cross the oval capture the speed of changing. It means that the stripes are rushing with intersecting the world.

It was made up of Ian Curtis as the lead singer, Peter Hook on bass, Stephen Morris as the drummer and Bernard Albrecht (Sumner) on guitar and occasional keyboards. They came out of the punk music scene in 1976, and in three years time became a band that inspired musicians from bands such as U2, Nine Inch Nails, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and The Cure. In 1980, they disbanded after the death of Ian Curtis and reformed as New Order.\nDuring the Anarchy in the UK tour, the Sex Pistols played in Manchester on June 4. In the audience that night were three young men living around Manchester: school mates Peter Hook and Bernard Albrecht, and Ian Curtis. A few days later, Hook and Albrecht decided to start up a band, with Hook on bass and Albrecht on guitar. They got Terry Mason as a drummer, but still needed a singer. They placed an ad in the Virgin record shop in Manchester. Curtis answered it and became the singer of the band, called at the time the Stiff Kittens. He would also write the lyrics.\nThey practiced a lot during a few months, and wrote their first songs. In May of 1977, the band's name was changed to Warsaw and Mason was replaced on drums by Tony Tabac. Just a month later, Tabac left and Steve Brotherdale was hired as new drummer. It was at the same time that Paul Morley of the NME and DJ Rob Gretton found out about the band and saw its potential. Warsaw made a demo tape with five songs in the Pennine Sound Studios in July, but Brotherdale quit the group a few days later.\nFinally, Stephen Morris joined the band. In October, they played at the Electric Circus, which was due to close down, along with The Fall and The Buzzcocks.\nIn December, they recorded four songs, which were to appear later as \"An Ideal For Living\". In January of 1978 the band changed its name to Joy Division to avoid any confusion with another group. They practised a lot and wrote new songs. On April 14 1978, they played along with 16 bands in a contest. Tony Wilson, who worked for Granada TV, and Rob Gretton liked their performance very much.\nIn 1979 Joy Division released their first album \"Unknown Pleasures\" which was well received by critics. During 1979 and early 1980 their popularity increased. Also in this period lead singer Ian Curtis suffered worsening bouts of illness caused by epilepsy.\nThe band returned to the studio in 1980 to record their second album \"Closer\" and a single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\". Before these recordings were released Curtis had committed suicide at just 23. The unreleased album and single were subsequently released to critical acclaim. The remaining members of Joy Division reformed in 1980 as New Order and enjoyed considerable worldwide success during the 1980s and 1990s.\nMany musicians and bands have acknowledged their appreciation of the work of Joy Division including U2 frontman Bono, Moby, Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Killers and the song Love Will Tear Us Apart has been covered by many artists from different musical backgrounds and genres."}

The fire is believed to have been caused accidentally by welders at a construction site.\nThe October Fire burned a small area in Santa Clarita, burning several homes in the Canyon Breeze Mobile Home Park.\nSince 20 October 2007, the Ranch fire has burned on the Los Angeles-Ventura county line, in the Angeles and Los Padres national forests. The fire is going around the Ventura County community of Piru and also threatens the communities of Fillmore, Ventura and Ojai. Three homes have been destroyed, and 500 residences are in the fire's path. As of 7:00\u00a0a.m. local time, the fire was 10% under control. Evacuations have been recommended in all of Piru and parts of Fillmore. Highway 126 is closed between Main Street and Chiquita Canyon Road in Piru. Angeles National Forest officials are closing the whole forest, starting October 23.\nOrange County.\nThe Santiago Fire began shortly before 5:55pm on October 21, 2007 in the foothills north of Irvine and east of the city of Orange in Orange County. Fire officials have said that the source of the fire is arson; the fire was said to have been started in three different spots. The fire has burned over and is 30% contained. Strong winds have stopped people from fighting the fire and forced a dozen firefighters to seek emergency shelter under tents after the fire moved at them. Two homes, one mobile home, and one outbuilding have been destroyed. Several other buildings damaged, and four firefighters were a bit hurt from the fire. Damage estimates put the fire's cost at $5.5 million.\nSan Bernardino County.\nCurrent data on the fires has been provided by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, although the chaotic nature of the fires meant not all information was available. As of October 23 at 11:34\u00a0a.m. PST:\nThe Slide Fire has burned at Green Valley Lake, west of Lake Arrowhead. The Green Valley Lake, Arrow Bear, and Running Springs communities are under evacuation. Reports indicate water pressure in local systems was lost and conditions were too harsh for fighters to continue efforts in some areas. The fire has burned a camp owned by the Boy Scouts of America's local council, the California Inland Empire Council, called \"Camp Helendade.\" Helendade was originally given to the council in 1960 to replace another camp that had been burned.\nThe Grass Valley Fire is burning just north of Lake Arrowhead. An online appeal from firefighters near the blaze at Lake Arrowhead showed that resources were spread thin:\n\"Immediate threat to 100 structures and possible threat to thousands ... Multiple downed power lines. IC (Incident Command) asking for resources from anywhere ... Lack of resources hindering suppression efforts. Unable to fly aircraft. All local engines are depleted.\"\nThe fire began near Martin Ranch Road and Meyers Road.\nThis fire was in the Ontario, California area. It damaged several buildings.\nTogether the fires made it a must to close Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass. One fire was started by an flipped-over semi-truck. This fire has burned 250\u00a0acres. It is currently 50 percent under control. 107 firefighters are assigned to this fire.\nThe Little Mountain fire threatens several homes and other structures.\nSanta Barbara County.\nThe Sedgewick Fire was the farthest north of the October 2007 California wildfires. It started around 6:00\u00a0a.m. PST on October 21, 2007 from a falling power line. The fire burned a total of near Los Olivos. Approximately 2000 people were affected and 800 homes threatened before the fire was all under control around 5:00\u00a0p.m. on October 22.\nRiverside County.\nThe Roca fire began at 3:52\u00a0p.m. on October 21 in Aguanga, and burned east of Temecula. The fire was 100% contained on October 22. One home was destroyed and one injury was reported from the fire.\nThe Rosa fire began at 11:00\u00a0p.m. on October 22 in western Temecula and has burned . There are people who have to leave and closed roads in this area. The fire is 50% under control; 100% expected by October 24 at 6\u00a0p.m.\nWind and weather.\nThe fires are occurring in a very dry area and they are being exacerbated by seasonal winds called the Santa Ana winds. The San Diego Union Tribune reported, \"Santa Ana winds blowing up to 60\u00a0mph combined with temperatures into the 90s to create in the worst possible fire conditions.\"\nSouthern California is in the midst of an unusual drought; in Los Angeles, California, with only 3.21\u00a0in\u00a0(82\u00a0mm) of precipitation in the entire 2006-2007 rain season, it is the driest year on record, receiving less rain than Death Valley in a normal year.\nThe Santa Ana winds are warm, dry winds that characteristically appear in Southern California and Northern Baja California weather during autumn and early winter. Santa Anas are a type of f\u00f6hn wind, the result of air pressure buildup in the high-altitude Great Basin between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. This high energy wind spills out of the Great Basin and is pulled by gravity into the surrounding lowlands. The air circulates clockwise around the high pressure area bringing winds from the east and northeast to Southern California (the reverse of the westerly winds characteristic of the latitude). The air heats up due to adiabatic heating while being compressed during its descent. While the air has already been dried by orographic lift prior to reaching the Great Basin, the relative humidity of the air declines rapidly as it descends and warms in its final stages as it passes over the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges.\nThe air is then forced down the mountain slopes out towards the Pacific coast; the air mass is further heated by compression as it drops in altitude before reaching the Los Angeles Basin, western San Diego County and Tijuana (Baja California) at typical speeds of 35 knots. The southern California coastal region gets some of its hottest weather of the year during autumn while Santa Ana winds are blowing. During Santa Ana conditions it is typically hotter along the coast than in the deserts and the humidity plummets to less than 15%.\nAs the Santa Ana winds are channeled through the mountain passes they can approach hurricane force. The combination of wind, heat, and dryness turns the chaparral into explosive fuel for the infamous wildfires the region is known for. Wildfires fanned by Santa Ana winds burned 721,791\u00a0acres (2,921\u00a0km\u00b2) in two weeks during October 2003.\nAs of October 22, the high wind conditions were expected to continue to hamper firefighting for three additional days.\nAt around 12:30\u00a0PM, officials believed that some of the fires have began generating their own winds, similar to the Oakland Firestorm of 1991.\nImpact.\nOn October 21, the Harris Fire damaged and disabled the Southwest Power Link, a 500,000-volt power line from Arizona to San Diego. Power outages were reported in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and other counties on October 22 to 333,500 Southern California Edison customers, most being restored within 24 hours. The power outage also affected the areas of Ojai, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, Thousand Oaks, Rialto, Fontana, San Bernardino, Rancho Cucamonga, Mira Loma, Hesperia, Corona, Bloomington, Irvine, Calimesa and Rubidoux. This outage also caused 230 people to be without power in Malibu. The California Independent System Operator Corp, or California ISO, declared an energy transmission emergency in southern California on October 23, due to wildfires affecting the lines. 500,000-, 230,000- and 138,000-volt lines were disabled in San Diego, and some lines in other areas were also disabled. 24,992 lost power, due to lack of power from the power grid.\nThe San Diego Community College District on October 22, 2007 initially closed Miramar College, followed by Mesa College and selected Continuing Education sites in the northern area of the District. Effective at 3:00\u00a0p.m. the same day all colleges, campuses and sites of the San Diego Community College District were closed and would remain so through at least October 23, 2007. Students and faculty were urged to seek an update on possible closures on October 23 after 5:00pm local time. Numerous other schools, businesses and universities have closed as well, including California State University, San Marcos, San Diego State University, UC San Diego, the University of San Diego and the San Diego Wild Animal Park. Classes for Tuesday, October 23 have been canceled for all of San Diego Unified School District and Sweetwater Union High School District as well as all other districts in the county and all schools in the municipalities of Tijuana, Tecate and Rosarito, located across the border in Baja California, Mexico.\nIn the Santa Clarita area, classes and events were cancelled at College of the Canyons and CalArts; local public schools were cancelled as well. All public schools were closed in Malibu, and there were some school closings in Orange County, Ventura County and San Bernardino County.\nBy mid-morning on October 22, 2007, thousands of evacuees were taking shelter in Qualcomm Stadium and other locations throughout San Diego. On the afternoon of October 22, 2007, the Marines were evacuating some planes from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to other military bases in California and Arizona. The San Diego Wild Animal Park moved some animals to the on-site animal hospital for their protection.\nAs of October 22 2007, with Qualcomm Stadium still hosting evacuees, the San Diego State University football team was still planning to host their Saturday game against BYU in the stadium. Some players and coaches have been affected by evacuations. Numerous San Diego area high schools canceled games and practices at least through October 242007. With many players from the San Diego Chargers affected by evacuations, the team has moved practices to Arizona and they may move their upcoming game there as well.\nResponse.\nGovernment agencies and volunteers worked together to mitigate the effects of the fires. According to the state of California's Consolidated Response web page, \"There are 17 active fires in Southern California. The priority for fighting fires as of 1930 on October 21 is the Buckweed, Witch, Harris, Canyon, Ranch, Santiago, and Sedgewick Fires.\"\nWith many businesses and schools closed, some people used their time off to help others. Officials estimated that 10,000 people were gathered at Qualcomm stadium, the largest shelter point in San Diego. Besides food, blankets and water, volunteers provided toys for children, massages, and a live rock and roll band performance. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints opened ten of its churches as temporary shelters and, at the request of the mayor of San Diego, delivered two truckloads of blankets and processed food to evacuees in Qualcomm Stadium.\nThe Salvation Army The Salvation Army USA Western Territory: Southern California Fires: The Salvation Army Helps First Responders, Evacuees is providing food, water and comfort to firefighters, police and others affected by the blaze.\nThe Navy and Marines were also helping in San Diego. Six crews from the Navy's Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85 based at Naval Air Station North Island have been assigned to battle the Witch Creek fire. They fly MH-60 Seahawk helicopters which have a 420-gallon water bucket and they are the only local Navy teams trained to fight fires from the air. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar has contributed several aircraft as well as fire fighting trucks to operations based in Ramona.\nCalifornia governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in seven California counties where fires burned. President George W. Bush declared a federal disaster for the seven counties and scheduled a Thursday, October 25, 2007 visit to the region."}

It was a herbivore that walked both as biped and a quadruped. It probably lived in herds. \nParasaurolophus was a hadrosaur. They had a large head crest, which was a long curved tube. It went upwards and back from the skull. The crest has been much discussed by scientists. They think its main functions were visual recognition of species and sex, acoustic resonance (making a loud sound), and thermoregulation. Parasaurolophus is one of the rarer hadrosaurs: there are only a few good specimens."}

It is based on the story \"Death in Venice\" (\"Der Tod in Venedig\") by the German writer Thomas Mann.\nThe libretto (words) for the opera was written by Myfanwy Piper. It was the last opera that Britten wrote. It was first performed at Snape Maltings near Aldeburgh, England on June 16, 1973. Britten was too ill to conduct it himself. The main part of Aschenbach was sung by Sir Peter Pears.\nThe story of the opera.\nThe story is supposed to take place in the year 1911. It starts in Munich, and then moves to Venice. The opera is divided into two acts.\nAct I.\nAschenbach is a famous German writer. He is getting old and starting to find it difficult to think of new ideas for stories. As he is walking in Munich he stops in front of a cemetery. He sees a traveller who is obviously from another country. This makes him think he ought to travel somewhere to get new ideas for his books.\nHe takes a boat to Venice. On the boat he watches a group of young people. Their leader is showing off. Aschenbach realizes that, although their leader looks young, he is in fact old. He has dressed in clothes and used make-up to make him look young. Aschenbach does not like him.\nIn Venice he is takes a gondola, but the boatman does not take him where he wants to go. Aschenbach argues at first, but the boatman does not take any notice. \nAschenbach arrives at the hotel. In the hotel he watches the people coming down to dinner. Suddenly he sees Tadzio. Tadzio is a young Polish boy who is unbelievably beautiful. Aschenbach realizes it is stupid for him to feel love for the boy, but he cannot get the boy out of his mind.\nAschenbach watches Tadzio playing on the sandy beach. When he notices that the boy (like many Polish people) hates the Russian guests, he realizes that the boy is not quite perfect after all.\nAschenbach walks along the streets of Venice. Everywhere beggars are asking him for money. There is a horrible smell coming from the water of the canals. Aschenbach decides to leave Venice. The hotel manager is very sorry that he going so soon. Tadzio walks past Aschenbach. Aschenbach goes to the train station, but his luggage has been put on the wrong train, so he goes back to the hotel. He is annoyed, but he is also pleased because he can see Tadzio again.\nAschenbach sits in his chair on the beach, watching Tadzio and his friends play. It makes him think of the Greek gods. The boys do different sports on the beach: running, long jump, discus, javelin and wrestling. Tadzio wins easily. Aschenbach wants to congratulate him, but when the chance comes he cannot speak.\nAct II.\nAschenbach realizes that he loves the boy. He goes to the barber for a shave. The barber tells him that lots of people in Venice are getting sick. Aschenbach wants to know whether it is something serious, but the barber says it is nothing to worry about.\nAschenbach is being rowed on the water. He can smell disinfectant. There are notices in the streets warning people to be careful of the sickness. In a German newspaper he reads that the sickness in Venice is cholera. It says that all German people should leave the city and return home. Aschenbach does not want the Polish family to leave Venice. He does not want them to know about the cholera. He follows then to a caf\u00e9 and to church, but he still cannot find the courage to speak to them. After dinner the guests watch a group of actors. Aschenbach notices that Tadzio, like himself, cannot laugh at their jokes.\nLots of the hotel guests are leaving. An English clerk tells him that lots of people in the city have Asiatic cholera. He tells him he ought to leave immediately before they stop everyone from leaving the city.\nAschenbach decides to warn Tadzio's mother of the danger of the illness, but he just cannot do it. He has a dream about the Greek gods. When he awakes he realises that these wild thoughts about Tadzio have gripped him. He cannot do anything about it.\nAgain Aschenbach watches as Tadzio and his friends play a game on the beach; they soon leave. Aschenbach goes to the barber. He asks him to try to make him beautiful and young. When he goes on a gondola he realises he is just like the old man he saw on the boat. He follows the Polish family. Tadzio starts to walk separately from his family. He waits for Aschenbach and looks straight at him, but Aschenbach turns away. He is pleased that Tadzio does not let his mother notice what happened. Aschenbach is alone again, and buys some strawberries. They are not fresh. He thinks about the Greek gods again, and about the relationship between a writer and what he writes about.\nThe hotel manager organizes the departure of the last guests. The Polish family are leaving. Aschenbach watches Tadzio and another boy playing on the beach. The game gets rough, and the other boy pushes Tadzio\u2019s face into the sand. Aschenbach tries to get up to help him, but he is too weak to get out of his chair. Tadzio is left alone on the beach. He gives Aschenbach a sign to follow him, but Aschenbach slumps back in his chair and dies. Tadzio continues walking far out into the sea.\nThe cast and the music.\nThe part of the boy Tadzio is a dancing part. He and his family never speak or sing in the opera.\nAll the different characters that Aschenbach meets: the man by the cemetery, the old man dressed as a young man, the gondolier, the hotel manager, the barber, the leader of the actors and the voice of the God Dionysus are really like one character. They are sung by the same singer, a bass-baritone. Apart from him and Aschenbach (a tenor) the only other solo singer in the opera is the voice of Apollo, sung offstage by a countertenor as the boys play sport on the beach. There are several choruses: the groups of young people, hotel staff, actors, church choir and tourists.\nThe whole sound of the opera is written with the voice of Peter Pears in mind. Britten\u2019s music is partly tonal but also uses twelve-tone music and gamelan music from the Far East. When Aschenbach sings recitative (telling the story) he is just accompanied by the piano. Britten deliberately uses a limited number of musical sounds. This gives the opera a specially expressive character, particularly in the beautiful ending."}

It was slightly smaller than the modern German state of Saarland.\nCommission of Government.\nAccording to Treaty of Versailles the highly industrialized Saarland was to be governed by the League of Nations for a period of 15 years, and its coalfields given to France. The \"Commission of Government\", which represented the League of Nations, had five members. At least one member had to be French and one a native of the Saar.\nAt the end of the 15 year period, in 1935, the people of the Saar voted on how they wanted their country. They voted to become a part of Nazi Germany.\nIt had a currency, the Saar franc, and its own postage stamps during this period.\nChairmen of the Commission.\nThe League of Nations' control to the region was represented by the following Chairmen of the Commission of Government:\nPlebiscite.\nIn 1933, many anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich's control. As a result, anti-Nazi groups wanted the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany. However, France had a lot of power in the Saar, including control of the coal mines. Not many \"Saarlanders\" liked France, and in the plebiscite on 13 January 1935, 90% of the voters wished to join Germany, and 8.86% wanted to stay with the League of Nations. Only 0.40% (that is, four voters in every thousand) wanted to join France.\nNazi rule.\nOn 17 January 1935, the territory's re-union with Germany was approved by the League Council. On 1 March, the Nazi Germany took over the region, and appointed Josef B\u00fcrckel as \"Reichskommissar f\u00fcr die R\u00fcckgliederung des Saarlandes\", \"Reich Commissioner for the re-union of Saarland\".\nMany former politicians and office holders of the Saargebiet were changed or arrested by the Nazis.\nWhen re-incorporation was completed, the governor became \"Reichskommissar f\u00fcr das Saarland\", \"Reich Commissioner of Saarland\" on 17 June 1936."}

He was one of the most important British composers of the mid-20th century, a period that included Benjamin Britten and Michael Tippett. His music has very lively rhythms which are often jazzy.\nEarly years.\nWalton\u2019s family were musical but they had very little money. Both his parents sang, and Walton sang in the local church choir. His father would hit him if he made a mistake. This may be why in later life he was so careful about every note he wrote.\nAt the age of ten he joined the choir of Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford. He learned the piano and violin. He was only 16 years when he went to Oxford University where he was at Christ Church, Oxford. Most of what he knew about composing he taught himself. He studied the scores of works by Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, Jean Sibelius and others. He had some lessons from Hugh Allen, the cathedral organist. At Oxford Walton became friends with two poets: Sacheverell Sitwell and Siegfried Sassoon. Most of the music he wrote when he was very young has been lost, but the choral anthem \"A Litany\", written when he was just fifteen, shows his musical talent with its modern harmonies. \nWalton left Oxford in 1920 without a degree having failed his exams three times. He went to live with the Sitwell family, who introduced him to many important people, including the composer Constant Lambert and song writer Noel Coward. He also travelled with the Sitwells to Italy. In 1923 he set one of Edith Sitwell\u2019s poems to music. The piece was called \"Fa\u00e7ade\". The music was very jazzy and almost jokey, and it sounded very modern to many people at that time.\nDuring the 1920s, Walton earned some money playing the piano at jazz clubs, but he spent most of his time composing in the Sitwells' . The orchestral overture \"Portsmouth Point\" (which he dedicated to Sassoon) was the first work which shows Walton\u2019s real style. In 1929 the Viola Concerto started to make him really famous. This was followed by \"Belshazzar's Feast\" (1931), the Symphony No. 1 (1935), the coronation march \"Crown Imperial\" (1937), and the Violin Concerto (1939). All these works are very popular today.\nAfter World War II.\nDuring World War II, Walton did not have to do military service so he had time to compose music for propaganda films, such as \"The First of the Few\" (1942), and Laurence Olivier's adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" (1944). After composing a second string quartet (1946) Walton spent most of the next seven years writing his opera, \"Troilus and Cressida\" (1947 \u2013 1954). The opera was not very popular. This was because his music was rather Romantic, very different from a lot of modern music that was in fashion in the 1950s, especially the music of Pierre Boulez and his followers.\nWalton also composed the music for two more Shakespeare-Olivier films - the Academy Award-winning \"Hamlet\", and \"Richard III\". Walton, however, did not win Oscars for any of his Shakespeare-based scores.\nWalton then started to write more orchestral music: the Cello Concerto (1956), the Symphony No. 2 (1960), and the \"Variations on a Theme by Hindemith\" (1963). He started to have many honours: He was knighted in 1951 and received the Order of Merit in 1968. People liked his one-act comic opera \"The Bear\", when it was performed at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1967, and he was asked by people from all over the world for new music. His song-cycles from this period were given their first performances by famous singers such as Peter Pears and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.\nIn his last years, Walton found composition more and more difficult. He tried to compose a third symphony for Andr\u00e9 Previn, but later gave up. His last works were mostly church music or reworkings of older pieces.. He had settled on the island of Ischia in Italy in 1949 with his Argentinian wife Susana Gil. He died there in 1983. \nSince his death, Walton's music has been performed and recorded a lot. People no longer think of him as old-fashioned, but as a composer who had a very strong personality which can be heard clearly in his music.\nWalton was knighted in 1951 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1967."}

It was set up on January 10, 1920, by Part III Section XI of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, and put under League of Nations protection, with special rights reserved to Poland, because it was the only port in the Polish Corridor.\nThe Free City ceased to exist after 1939 when it was occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany. After Germany's defeat in 1945 Danzig was occupied and annexed by Poland under the Polish name Gda\u0144sk.\nEstablishment.\nTerritory.\nThe Free City of Danzig included the major city of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) as well as Zoppot (Sopot), Tiegenhof (Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski), Neuteich (Nowy Staw) and some 252 villages and 63 hamlets. Its area was .\nPolish rights.\nThe Free City was represented abroad by Poland's ambassadors. The railway line that connected the Free City with Poland was administered by Poland. Similarly, the separated military post within the city's harbour, the Westerplatte (formerly a city beach), was also given to Poland. There were also two post-offices, one for the Danzig Postal Service, the other was Polish-run.\nLeague of Nations High Commissioners.\nLeague of Nations mandated territories, were run by member countries on behalf of the League. But Danzig and the Saargebiet were run by the League of Nations itself, with representatives of various countries taking on the role of High Commissioner:\nPopulation.\nThe Free City's population was 357,000 in (1919). 98% were German-speakers, with the rest mainly speaking either Kashubian or Polish.\nThe Treaty of Versailles, split Danzig from Germany. The treaty made the people living in the city citizens of the Free City. German inhabitants lost their German nationality, if they wanted to stay German they had to go and live outside the Free City's territory.\nPolitics.\nHeads of State of the Free City of Danzig\nIn May 1933, the Nazi Party won the local elections in the city. But they had less than the two-thirds majority that would let them change the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig. The government introduced anti-Semitic and also anti-Catholic laws against the Poles and Kashubian inhabitants.\nPoland always refused to allow the status of Danzig to change. In April 1939 the Polish Commissioner-General said that Poland was willing to fight if there was a change..\nSecond World War and aftermath.\nThe Nazi government voted for re-unification with Germany on September 2, 1939, the day after the German invasion of Poland began.\nAround 90% of the city was reduced to ruins towards the end of the Second World War. On March 30, 1945 the city was taken by the USSR. It is thought that more than 90% of the pre-war population were either dead or had fled by 1945.\nThe Allied Powers were told at the Potsdam conference that the former Free State was now part of Poland. (The Yalta conference was unclear whether the Free City would be recreated or not)."}

Usually, the storm makes landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, with the remaining moisture normally having mild rainfall effects on the state. However, a few storms have crossed into Arizona while they still had tropical storm strength.\nIt is extremely difficult for a hurricane to form in Arizona because the normal storms that form in the eastern Pacific Ocean move either parallel or away from the Pacific coast of Northwestern Mexico. As a result, most storms that could affect Arizona, are carried away from the United States, and only 6% of all Pacific hurricanes enter US territory. In average, Arizona experiences the effects of tropical cyclones once every five years. Many, but not all, of these systems also affected California.\nTropical storms are one of Arizona's main sources of rainfall, and they infuse the monsoon over the southwestern United States. However, all of the storms that have impacted Arizona have formed in the latter parts of the Pacific hurricane season, and no storm has affected the state before August.\nDeadly storms.\nSome of these tropical cyclones have caused deaths or a lot of property damage, usually because of flooding created by rain.\nIn August of 1935, the remnants of an unnamed tropical storm that landed on southern California causing heavy rains and flooding across Arizona, especially along the Santa Cruz River and Rillito Creek on Southern Arizona. The rainfall due to the storm still holds the record rainfall at the National Weather Service office in Tucson.\nIn September of 1970, the remnants of Tropical Storm Norma became Arizona's deadliest storm when they contributed to the disaster known as the \"Labor Day storm of 1970\". As Norma dissipated, moisture from the cyclone was captured in a large extratropical low. The resulting rainfall created deadly floods that killed 23 people and caused huge damages. Two years later, the remnants of Hurricane Joanne caused flooding that created damages up to $10 million (1972 USD) and eight deaths.\nOn September 11, 1976, Hurricane Kathleen killed a man when a gust of wind blew a palm tree down onto his mobile home. Strong flooding and hailstorms also resulted.\nA weather system, including moisture from Tropical Storm Octave, caused heavy rains over a ten-day period. Fourteen people drowned, 975 were injured, and roughly 10,000 people were left homeless when the flooding ended. The amount of damage from the disaster was put at 370 million (year unknown) USD."}

The outcome depends on the speed at which the mixed substances move through special \"media\", or chemical substances. It consists of a \"stationary phase\" (a solid) and a \"mobile phase\" (a liquid or a gas). The mobile phase flows through the stationary phase. Chromatography is much used in biochemistry and analytical chemistry.\nFlat-plane chromatography.\nThe stationary phase is a flat plane, such as paper, or a substance on glass. \nPaper chromatography.\n\"Paper chromatography\" is a technique for separating and identifying mixtures that are (or can be) coloured. It has been largely replaced by \"thin layer chromatography\", but is still a powerful teaching tool. \"Double-way paper chromatography\", also called 'two-dimensional chromatography', uses two solvents and rotates the paper 90\u00b0 in between. It is useful for separating complex mixtures of compounds having similar polarity, for example, amino acids. The compounds used initially ensures you to know whether the colour is pure, (one substance only) or mixtures (multiple substances.) \nThin layer chromatography.\nThin layer chromatography (TLCC) is a common laboratory technique similar to paper chromatography. Instead of a stationary phase of paper, it uses a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat substrate. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and to allow for quantification, high-performance TLC can be used.\nColumn chromatography.\n\"Column chromatography\" separates compounds using many chemical actions between the chemical being tested and the chromatography column (a rod with a blending of special chemicals). The column is run using either gravity or a pump.\nThe mixed substance to be tested is added in a small amount and is slowed by certain chemical or physical activity with the chemicals in the chromatography column. The amount of slowing depends on the type of chemicals in the substance being tested and the different phases. The time at which a certain chemical elutes (comes out of the end of the column) is called the \"retention time\" and there is thought to be only one for one chemical. \nThe most common stationary phase for column chromatography is silica gel, followed by alumina. Cellulose powder has been used in the past. The mobile phase is either a pure solvent or a mixture of solvents. It is chosen to \nmake the time and amount of solvent used as little as possible, while still clearly separating the chemicals being tested.\nHPLC.\n\"High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\" is also sometimes referred to as high-pressure liquid chromatography. It is column chromatography run under pressure to raise the speed of the process. \nCommon solvents used in HPLC are mixes of water or various organic liquids (the most common are methanol, ethanol or acetonitrile)."}

It does many things that a computer can do, but is small enough to fit in someone's hand. It is a mobile phone, meaning that it makes calls and sends text messages but without wires. There're many types of iPhones, such as the model iPhone X.\nThe iPhone can access the Internet as well, either using a cellular network or over Wi-Fi. Like an iPod, it plays music and videos that have been downloaded from the Internet directly, or which have been put on it by connecting it to a personal computer, which is called syncing. It also has a calendar and 1, 2 or 3 built-in cameras. A user can make it do many other things, such as run video games, by downloading apps from the App Store.\nThe iPhone doesn't have as many buttons as other well-known phones in the early days, such as those made by companies like Motorola and Nokia. Instead, it had a touch screen that covers much of the front of the phone. People control the phone by touching things that appear on the screen with a finger or two. This technology is called multi-touch, and involves tapping, dragging, and even typing on a keyboard picture shown on the screen.\nAll iPhones run on a mobile operating system which Apple calls \"iOS\". A new version of iOS comes out every year, each having more features than the one before. Each new iPhone comes with the latest version of iOS, and older iPhones usually also get a software update to the latest version. The more-recent iPhones, such as the iPhone 11 and variants of it, use iOS 13 and came out in September 2019.\nAs of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.\nHistorical Information.\nThere have been ten types of iPhone models. \nThe original iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. In the first month on sale (Jul 2007), it sold 2.315 million units. On July 11, 2008, the iPhone 3G was released which, hence the name, got upgraded with 3G wireless internet. On June 17, 2009, Apple released the iPhone 3GS which featured a compass and a 3.2-megapixel video camera. On June 24, 2010, a new version of the iPhone, the iPhone 4, was released. It has the Face Time-camera included, which is placed on the screen side and allows taking self-portraits while looking at the viewfinder. The Face Time-camera is less advanced than the back camera, but can be used for video-telephony, where the members of the talking can see each other on the screen. Additionally, it has an updated operating system that allows quicker navigation of all the features. This operating system is called IOS. The iPhone 4 also has more pixels (326 ppi; 960\u00d7640) on the screen than previous version of the iPhone, which makes all features such as pictures and videos look sharper. A minor upgrade to the iPhone 4 was the iPhone 4S. It came on October 14, 2011, and had a new feature called Siri, which is a voice activation system. Additionally, it is able to record videos in 1080p-FullHD-resolution, which is 2.25\u00d7 times higher than 720p, so that each still frame from the video contains more details. This makes it possible to see smaller items on the footage in a sharper, clearer way. Additionally, it allows zooming into the video to see more details.\nThe iPhone 5 was released on September 21, 2012. The most noticeable change is its bigger 4 inch screen, which had the same pixel density and the same width on the short axis, but it was taller (1136\u00d7640 pixels). On September 10, 2013, two new iPhones called the 5C and 5S were announced. They were released on September 20, 2013. The iPhone 5S has a new unlocking system called Touch ID which reads your fingerprint. The iPhone 5C is a cheaper model of the iPhone 5S which is also the first iPhone available in different colors that aren't black and white. The internal hardware specifications (which means, capabilities) of the iPhone 5C are identical to the iPhone 5. Only the size of the battery has increased by 51 mAh, (1456\u21921507 mAh), and the design, which deviant from the Apple standard design language, which means, that it looks and feels distinguishable (different) than the other iPhones. Like iPhone 6, the design does not allow the iPhone 5C to stand like a domino stone.\nThe iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were released on September 19, 2014. They both have bigger screens than the iPhone 5, measuring at 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, respectively. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were released on September 25, 2015. They both come in a new color, Rose Gold.\nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were released on September 16, 2016.\niPhone 8, 8 Plus, X, XR, XS, XS Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, SE (2nd gen), 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max were released in 2017, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2020, 2020, 2020, 2020 and 2020 respectively.\nCarriers.\nIn most places, the iPhone is only allowed with carriers (cellphone service providers) that Apple has an agreement with. Someone who buys an iPhone also signs a contract with the carrier, which is an agreement to pay for their services. A mobile phone contract usually lasts for one or two years, and the person buying the phone pays the carrier every month.

The hall where the concerts are held may have a \u201cstage\u201d (where the performers are) and there will be an \u201cauditorium\u201d where the audience sits.\nSome concert halls are purpose-built. That means they were built to be concert halls. Other concert halls may have been something else many years ago, e.g. a Corn Exchange (a place where farmers used to sell their corn) and the building has later been changed into a concert hall. Purpose-built concert halls started about the beginning of the 20th century. At that time scientists began to understand the importance of good acoustics (somewhere where the sound was good).\nConcert halls that are purpose-built usually have fixed seating (seats that cannot be moved). Some halls may have seats that can be moved, either by stacking them in small piles, or tiered seating that can fold up. This allows the hall to be used for other things, e.g. dancing.\nA concert hall is usually a big hall: big enough for an orchestra to be on the stage. A small concert hall, designed for just a few performers (as in chamber music) may be called a \u201crecital hall\u201d.\nSome concert halls are especially famous. In London there is the Royal Festival Hall on the banks of the river Thames, the Barbican Centre in the City (near St Paul\u2019s Cathedral) and the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington which is used for other events as well. There is also a famous recital hall called the Wigmore Hall. New York has the Carnegie Hall, Vienna has the Vienna Musikverein with a beautiful hall called the Golden Hall where the famous New Year\u2019s Day concerts are given. In Germany there is the Berliner Philharmonie in Berlin and the Gewandhaus in Leipzig. In Amsterdam there is the Concertgebouw (which means: \"concert hall\")."}

Madrigals were popular in the 16th and 17th centuries. This was the end of the Renaissance music and beginning of the Baroque periods. They started in Italy and became very popular for a short time in England as well as in France. The words of madrigals are always about secular (non-religious) things, e.g. about love.\nWhen Italian composers started writing madrigals the kinds of songs they knew were the frottola, the motet and the French chanson (song). The first madrigals were for 2 or 3 voices, but later many madrigals were written for 4 or 5 voices. These voices might be single voices (one person to each part) or several people. Sometimes the lines would also be played by an instrument, but the madrigal is usually sung unaccompanied.\nThe madrigal was the most important secular form of music of its time. In Italy it was very popular between about 1550 and 1630. In England the madrigal period was about 1588 to 1620. \nIn 1533 a book called \"Primo libro di Madrigali\" (First Book of Madrigals) was collected and published by Philippe Verdelot in Venice. It made madrigals very popular. Jacob Arcadelt published several volumes of madrigals which were very important for their development. In 1588 in England Nicholas Yonge published a collected called \"Musica Transalpina\" (Music from over the Alps). These were Italian madrigals with translated texts. The madrigal suddenly became extremely popular in England and remained so until after 1620 when it gradually became less important.\nPeople liked madrigals because they were fun. Whenever possible the composer made the music sound like the word being sung. A word like \u201csmile\u201d would have quick music, \u201csigh\u201d would have a note followed by a short rest, as if the singer were sighing, \u201crise so high\u201d would be sung to music which rose very high. This kind of thing was called \u201cword-painting\u201d. It can be found in religious music as well, but the way it was used in madrigals was new and exciting. Very often there would be a verse and a refrain which was often just sung to words such as \u201cfa la la la la\u201d. The songs were often about shepherds and shepherdesses falling in love.\nThe most important composers of madrigals in Italy were Giovanni da Palestrina, Luca Marenzio, Jacques Arcadelt, Adrian Willaert, Cipriano de Rore, Carlo Gesualdo, Giaches de Wert and Claudio Monteverdi. In England they were William Byrd, Thomas Morley, John Wilbye, Thomas Weelkes, John Dowland, Orlando Gibbons and Thomas Tomkins. About the franco-flemish , Orlando di Lasso, Josquin des Prez . About the spanish, Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria, Mateo Flecha.\nPerformance of madrigals.\nIn the Renaissance, madrigals were performed either as entertainment at important feasts, or for relaxed enjoyment by groups of amateurs in their homes, as madrigals were a secular style of song.\nNowadays, madrigals are often sung by high school or college madrigal choirs often as an after-dinner entertainment. Sometimes the singers wear Renaissance costumes."}

Sonora borders the states of Chihuahua to the east, Sinaloa to the south, and Baja California to the northwest. To the north Sonora accounts for a long stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border adjacent to the U.S. states of Arizona and New Mexico; to the west it borders the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez).\nDescription.\nThere are various explanations as to the origin of the word Sonora. Here, we will tell you some of the most widely accepted versions. One of these says that when the Spaniards arrived in the lands occupied by the Opata people, they built a chapel and painted an image of the Virgin on a buffalo skin. Over time, when the Opatas began to worship the Virgin, they used to call her Senora instead of the Spanish word Se\u00f1ora (Our Lady). Finally, it would seem that this word became Sonora as we know it today. \nAnother version has it that Sonora is derived from the Opata word, sonotl which means corn leaf. A legend speaks of an indigenous group that lived near the village of Hu\u00e9pac, and who used corn leaves to cover the walls and roofs of their huts. Yet another version insists that the word comes from the name of a tribe that lived on the banks of the Sonora River; these people were known as the Sonora Indians. This river crosses a large part of the state. It is also useful to understand that, just as Mexico has its national emblems, so the state of Sonora has its own coat-of-arms. "}

The word was first used in English for the seasonal rains in the Indian subcontinent. These rains blow in from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area.\nMonsoons also occur in other regions such as in North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil and East Asia.\nMonsoons happen because of a simple fact: land heats up faster than water. The temperature difference between the land and sea can be as much as 20\u00b0C \u2013 land temperatures in India can be hotter than 45\u00b0C, while the surrounding water in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea remains in the low 20s. The heat absorbed by the land warms the air above it. The hot air rises, and cooler ocean air rushes inland to replace it. As it moves, it carries moisture with it, releasing it over land as the summer monsoon (also known as southwest monsoon). \nThe hot air over the land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. Rainfall is increased by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains, as with the Tibetan Plateau, and by surface heating."}

It was located in Mesopotamia. The Akkadian empire reached its peak during the rule of Sargon of Akkad in the 24th and 22nd centuries BCE, and it eventually collapsed in 2154 BCE. The ruins have not been found, but it is believed to be on the River Euphrates. The empire comes after a long relationship with Sumer, and before the ethnic Akkadian empires of Babylonia and Assyria. \nAccording to the Sumerian king list, Akkad (Agade) was built by Sargon of Akkad, 23th century BC, and is often called the first empire in history. Even so, it is known from older cuneiform writings that the city was already there before Sargon, in the time of the kings of Uruk. According to the Bible (Genesis 10:10), it was one of the cities started by Nimrod. Also, in the earliest records, when Mesopotamian kings started calling themselves \"lord of the four quarters\" around Sumer, these were listed as: Martu, Shubar, Elam, and Uri-ki. \nAs the capital city of the Akkadian Empire beginning with Sargon, the city ruled from around 2300 to 2215 BC, when it was destroyed by the Gutians who invaded from the mountains. \nSargon.\nSargon conquered many of the surrounding regions. He created an empire which reached as far as the Mediterranean Sea and Anatolia, and extended his rule to Elam, and as far south as Oman. He ruled over this area for 56 years. Trade extended from the silver mines of Anatolia to the lapis lazuli mines in Afghanistan, the cedars of Lebanon and the copper of Oman. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.\nImages of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia (Subartu) were also subjugated and rebellions in Sumer were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and against Sarlak, king of Gutium.\nAkkadian language.\nThe Akkadian language was one of the Semitic languages, and at the time of the Akkadian Empire it was made official in both Mesopotamia and Elam. Akkadian remained the main diplomatic language of Mesopotamia for centuries.\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.\nCollapse of the Empire.\nThe fall of the empire established by Sargon seems to have been as sudden as its rise, and little is known about the Gutian period. From the fall of Akkad ca. 2083 BC until the Sumerian renaissance ca. 2050 BC, there is much that is still dark. It has recently been suggested that the regional decline at the end of the Akkadian period (and also in the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom) was associated with rapidly increasing aridity, and failing rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East."}

Although each song may be sung separately, the composer really imagined that they would be performed together as one work. Sometimes they tell a story, but sometimes they just belong together because they are about the same idea (e.g. the sadness that can be caused by love). They are often for solo voice and piano accompaniment, but they can also be without accompaniment, or with several instruments or even a whole orchestra. The words of a cycle are often by the same poet, but this is not always the case.\nSong cycles started to become popular with composers in the Romantic period. Although there were examples of song cycles written before that, it was the German composers of the 19th century who are most often thought of as writers of song cycles. Their songs are called \"Lieder\".\nThe great composer Franz Schubert wrote about 600 songs. These include two long song cycles: \"Winterreise\" (\"Winter\u2019s Journey\") and \"Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin\" (\"The beautiful miller\u2019s daughter\"). Each of these song cycles is long enough for a whole concert. Robert Schumann wrote song cycles including two which he simply called \"Liederkreise\" (\"Song Cycles\"), and his well-known \"Dichterliebe\" (\"Poet\u2019s Love\") and \"Frauenliebe und -Leben\" (\"Women\u2019s Love and Life\"). Brahms wrote \"Vier ernste Ges\u00e4nge\" (\"Four Serious Songs\"), and Gustav Mahler, who became very interested in folk song, wrote several song cycles with orchestra accompaniment, including \"Das Lied von der Erde\" (\"The Song of the Earth\").\nFrench composers who wrote song cycles include Jules Massenet, Gabriel Faur\u00e9 and Claude Debussy. Russian composers include Modest Mussorgsky and Dmitri Shostakovich, and English and American composers in the 20th century include Michael Tippett, Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland as well as the South American Alberto Ginastera, Juan Mar\u00eda Solare and Heitor Villa-Lobos."}

Tipperary, Ireland.\nO'Dowd was a part of the British new romantic movement which emerged in the late 1970s and was popularised in the early 1980s. He and Marilyn (born Peter Robinson) were regulars at 'The Blitz' a very popular nightclub in London. It was run by Steve Strange of the musical group Visage. The Blitz was a starting place for many early 1980s pop stars such as Spandau Ballet. The new romantics based their image on the coolness of David Bowie and high fashion. They liked the music of Bowie, Kraftwerk, Marc Bolan and post punk New Wave.\nO'Dowd gained fame with his group Culture Club during the 1980s. His music is often called blue-eyed soul. He was heavily influenced by Rhythm and Blues and reggae. Early recordings with Culture Club showed that O'Dowd's vocals had an emotional quality which was like American soul music of the 1960s and 1970s. His later solo work has also touched on glam rock influences and was particularly influenced by David Bowie and Iggy Pop.\nO'Dowd is also known for his flamboyant and androgynous appearance during the 1980s and early 1990s.\nOn 11 May 2009, Boy George was released from prison at HMP Edmunds Hill in Newmarket, Suffolk.

They are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, having sold over 130 million records worldwide.\nBand history.\nThe first years.\nThe song \"Runaway\" which was written by Jon Bon Jovi and George Karak reached the first place in a radio talent contest in 1983. So Jon became the possibility to sign a recording contract. Coincidentally he founded Bon Jovi in 1983 with Richie Sambora, Alec John Such, Tico Torres, and David Bryan. The self-titled debut album \"Bon Jovi\" was released in 1984. The single \"Runaway\" was the band's first hit and reached #39 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984.\n\"Slippery When Wet\".\nBon Jovi's second album \"7800\u00b0 Fahrenheit\" (1985) had also only moderate success. In fact, every member of the band had lost their girlfriend at the time, they were all heartbroken; those feelings were showing in the songs. Some members, especially Richie, were afraid because they had not put out a hit song since \"Runaway\". The band then went to Vancouver to record another album. They lived together while they were recording.\nIn 1986, Bon Jovi's third album \"Slippery When Wet\" was released. It brought them some of the band's most successful songs, including \"You Give Love a Bad Name\", \"Livin' On A Prayer\", and \"Wanted Dead or Alive\". Also involved was Desmond Child, Bruce Fairbairn, and Bob Rock, and Desmond co-wrote some of the songs on the album. \"Slippery When Wet\" has sold over 28 million copies worldwide. The \"Slippery When Wet\" Tour let the band become even more famous in Europe and North America.\nThe song \"Livin' on a Prayer\" is the one that had the most success. In the beginning, Jon Bon Jovi did not like the original song. Richie Sambora, however, convinced him that the song was good. They rewrote the entire musical piece together, added a guitar solo, different drum fills and a talk box to make it a hit song.\nJon gave everything he had to sing \"Livin' on a Prayer\" during the first part of the \"Slippery When Wet\" tour, and it was seriously damaging his voice. He was barely able to sing at the end of the tour and he had to use a lot of backing tracks to fill out the parts that he could not sing. He also used the services of a vocal coach and some steroids to help him finish the tour without losing his voice completely. At the end of the tour, they had played 206 shows all around the world. The band members took a break before going back into the studio to make another album.\nThe 1990s.\nAfter the enormous success with \"Slippery When Wet\" and the following tour, Bon Jovi released their fourth album 1988's \"New Jersey\". It was also successful and contained the hit \"Bad Medicine\" and the ballad \"I'll Be There for You\". Between 1990 and 1992, the band members went their separate ways for a while. Jon Bon Jovi released his first solo album \"Blaze of Glory\", that served as the soundtrack for the movie \"Young Guns II\". In 1992, \"Keep the Faith\" was released. The album signified a music genre change. Bon Jovi turned away from heavy drums and wild guitar solos, and their new sound was lighter and calmer than in the eighties. The piano had a bigger influence now and the lyrics had a different meaning. The song \"Keep the Faith\" is about social and religious problems. The singles \"Bed of Roses\", \"Keep the Faith\" and \"In These Arms\" reached the Top 40 in the United States. In 1994, Bon Jovi's first greatest hits album was released: \"The Best of Bon Jovi, Cross Road\". It includes the hits from 1983 to 1992 and two new songs. One of them, \"Always\", became one of the most successful songs of Bon Jovi. \"Always\" is a love song and a power ballad written by Jon Bon Jovi alone. The 1995 album \"These Days\" was the band's sixth studio album. \"This Ain't a Love Song\" was the lead single of \"These Days\" who sold over 11 million copies all around the world.\n\"Crush\" and \"Bounce\".\nFrom 1995, till, 2000, Bon Jovi had a longer break. The band members focused on solo projects and family. In 2000 the first album after 5 years was released: \"Crush\". The album itself was not as prosperous as \"Slippery When Wet\" and \"Keep The Faith\". But the hit-single \"It's my Life\" became the most successful song of Bon Jovi. It reached the first place in the charts of many countries. The next album was \"Bounce\" in 2002. It's was influenced by the September 11 attacks.\n\"The Circle\".\n\"The Circle\" was released in 2009. They were on tour in 2010 in places like New Jersey. It consists of songs like \"We Weren't Born To Follow\", \"Thorn In My Side\", and \"Bullet\".\n\"What About Now\".\nWhat About Now was released in 2013."}

The movie stars Ingrid Bergman, Yul Brynner, and Helen Hayes. Other players include Akim Tamiroff (who earlier worked with Ingrid Bergman in the movie \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\"), Martita Hunt (who has a comic part as a fussy lady-in-waiting), and, in a small role, Natalie Schafer (familiar to television audiences from her later role on \"Gilligan's Island\"). This movie was one of many European movies directed by Litvak into the 1950s and 1960s. It earned an Academy Award for Bergman, who did more movies after this movie. It was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay.\nHistorical Basis.\nThe movie is based upon the story of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. The youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, Anastasia was brutally murdered along with her parents and siblings by the Bolsheviks, in an attempt to prevent them from reclaiming power, should they ever escape from captivity. Despite the testimony of Yakov Yurovsky and others present at the shooting, many failed to believe that every member of the family had been killed. This rumor was made worse by stories of one or more of them escaping, thanks to sympathetic guards at the Ipatiev House, where they were being held. Also complicating the truth was the fact the location of the bodies remained a mystery, as they had been burned and buried in a remote forest.\nWith rumors swirling that one or more of the Romanovs might have escaped, numerous individuals came forward claiming to be one of the Grand Duchesses or Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich. The most notable of these was Anna Anderson, who rose to fame in the 1920s with her outlandish claims that she was Anastasia. The movie was most certainly based on Anderson's story, as the opening shots show a woman about to commit suicide from a bridge, as Anna Anderson did. While Anderson vehemently stated she was the heir to the Romanov family, many around her had doubts. Nevertheless, her story was immensely popular with the public.\nWhile the movie hints that Anna was in fact Anastasia, it is now proved beyond a doubt that Anderson was an impostor. With the final resting places of the Romanovs were discovered in 1991 and 2008, all of their bodies have been accounted for. Additionally, DNA tests conducted on the bodies prove that all were members of the Romanov family. Further, DNA testing on a piece of Anderson's intestine that had been saved during an operation she had during the early 1980s proved that she was not a Romanov, but most likely Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. Nevertheless, doubt still persisted. Several strands of her hair were discovered in a book, which was also tested. This too proved she was not a member of the royal family and also increased the likelihood that she was Schanzkowska.\nThe movie.\nThe movie tells the story of a young, confused woman in 1920s France, played by Ingrid Bergman. She is found by a group of Russian people who have left their country. They want her to pretend to the world that she is Anastasia, in order to retrieve her inheritance. The real Anastasia, if she were alive, would inherit millions of pounds which had been left in an English bank by the Tsar.\nThe Russians, led by General Bounine (played by Yul Brynner), teach her how to behave as the Grand Duchess Anastasia would. They teach her everything she ought to know about her childhood. They teach her to walk like a Duchess, practicing with a book on her head. When they think she is ready, she is introduced to several people who knew Anastasia. None of them believe she really is Anastasia. The real test comes when she is taken by General Bounine (Brynner) to Denmark to meet the Dowager Empress, Maria Feodorovna, mother of the Tsar, played by Helen Hayes. At first the old Empress does not believe the young woman is her granddaughter, but when Anastasia coughs because she is nervous, the Empress remembers that Anastasia used to do this as a child. She now believes she is her granddaughter. Meanwhile, Prince Paul wants to marry Anastasia. He's obviously after the money he thinks she will inherit. In the final scene, there is a party. The Dowager Empress is going to announce the engagement between Paul and Anastasia, but Anastasia and General Bounine have suddenly disappeared. The Dowager realizes that Anastasia does not desire fame, but simply love, with the man of her choosing. She says very bravely that she will go in to where all the guests are waiting and tell them that the party is over and that they should go home."}

It often involves turning, climbing, and swirling.\nDogfights started during World War I when the fighter planes did not have many weapons.\nThe first aerial dogfight occurred during the Battle of Cer (15\u201324 August 1914), when Serbian aviator Miodrag Tomi\u0107 encountered an Austro-Hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over Austro-Hungarian positions. The Austro-Hungarian pilot initially waved, and Tomi\u0107 waved back. The Austro-Hungarian pilot then fired at Tomi\u0107 with his revolver.\u00a0 Tomi\u0107 produced a pistol of his own and fired back. Tomi\u0107 managed to escape, and within several weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian planes were fitted with machine-guns.\nModern weapons such as homing missiles did not exist in that time, and planes could only fight each other with machine guns. Since the machine guns were only useful at close range, the planes had to fly very close together to have combat. Pilots had to fly with many maneuvers to try to not be shot, and be able to shoot the enemy planes. This new type of flying was named dogfighting. Fighter planes made just for this type of flying were sometimes called dogfighters. During World War II many had autocannons firing small, explosive artillery shells. They kept farther apart so they would not be destroyed quickly.\nIn modern air combat, there are many long range weapons that can be used before dogfighting. Homing missiles can be fired much further away from the target than machine guns, and will automatically try to follow the target. These types of weapons make dogfighting less common, but modern planes still have Gatling guns, which are more advanced kinds of machine guns. This is because dogfighting still happens sometimes."}

It was designed in the early 1900s by John Browning and was used in battle by many soldiers in World War I, World War II, The Korean War, and in the Vietnam War. It is semi-automatic and can fire a bullet each time the trigger is pulled. Military versions of the gun can hold seven or eight rounds inside its magazine and one more in the chamber. M1911 style guns are still made today and are for sale.\nIt was the most used pistol in the United States Military from 1911-1985, when it was replaced by the 9mm caliber Beretta M9, a military version of the Beretta 92. The M1911 was replaced because military leaders liked that the Beretta pistol could hold more bullets. Another reason was because other NATO countries pressured the US to follow a rule that all NATO weapons must use the same ammunition. Even after the Beretta M9 officially replaced the M1911, many US soldiers still use the M1911 in combat. The M1911 is a common pistol design for police and special forces because it is reliable in function, easy to modify by a gunsmith, and effective. \nThe \"1911\" in the name is because the pistol was adopted by the United States Army in the year 1911. M1911A1 pistols have an 'A1' added because they were changed from the original design in the 1920s in military service. The pistol was made first by Colt Manufacturing but was produced by many other companies during World War II. Because the M1911 is so popular, several gun companies make their own version of this gun which are still sold today."}

Many people were afraid that communism would stop the American way of life. Some people falsely accused their enemies and even their friends of being communists during this time. Miller writes about the ideas of fear and false accusation which affected him during this time.\nA \"crucible\" is a severe test or trial, which is exactly what happens in the play. Miller intended \"The\u00a0Crucible\" as an allegory to McCarthyism. The events that took place during the time the play was written were very similar to the Salem witch hunts. This is why Miller named the book \"The Crucible\" after the Salem Witch Trials.\nCharacters.\nMany of the characters in the Crucible are based on real people who were at the Salem Witch trials. Some are also based on people in the 1950s Red Scare, such as Joseph McCarthy and Julius Rosenberg\nPlot (theatre version).\nIn the beginning of the story, Reverend Parris is looking at his daughter, Betty, while weeping and praying. She is asleep on her bed and cannot wake up. They know that she is not dead, but she does not move or speak. She just lies there. Parris heard that Betty and other girls were dancing in the woods. (This was a very bad thing at the time because that implied they knew the devil.)\nReverend Parris's slave, Tituba, is from Barbados. Abigail says that she put a spell on Betty so she would not wake up. Parris is angry with Tituba. He makes her say that she was a witch, and the devil made her curse Betty. Suddenly, Abigail and Betty both say that they were with the devil too, so they would get out of trouble. They say that other people like Goody Osborne and Goody Good are witches too. \nJohn Proctor's relationship with his wife is quite tense because he cheated on her with Abigail. They try to pretend that nothing is wrong but end up having a tense argument about it. While they are arguing, Mary Warren comes in. Proctor is angry with her for leaving the house when he demanded that she did not. She is arrogant and says she is an official of the court and that her services are needed. Mary informs John and Elizabeth that many more than 39 people will be executed instead of the 19 they heard about. She also claims that she saved Elizabeth's life because Elizabeth was \"somewhat mentioned\" in court. After Mary goes to bed, Cheever comes to arrest Elizabeth. John does not take it well and rips the arrest warrant. After an emotional exchange, Elizabeth is taken and she gives Mary brief directions for the next day. \nIn court, John tries to help his wife by accusing the \"witches\" in court with Mary's deposition. He tells the court how well he knows these people and that they cannot be witches. He confesses that he slept with Abigail and that she wishes to see Elizabeth dead. Abigail is angered and threatens the judge. He tries to get Mary to tell the truth and she initially does, but then reforms to Abigail's act again after being accused of working with the devil. Mary then calls John a witch and says that he has dealings with the devil. This is a problem because John is very respected in the town, so the judges ask him to admit that he works with the devil. He will be able to live if he lies. \nIn the end, he signs a letter of confession stating that he works with the devil. Then he destroys the letter instead of lying. He wants to live so he could look after his family, but chose to keep his respect and honor instead. He is tried and the court kills him by hanging. However, the court allows Elizabeth to live because she is pregnant. Abigail runs away to Boston with Mercy Lewis, after stealing her uncle's money because she thinks that people know she told lies."}

Bottlenose dolphins are closely related to porpoises. They are skilled and accurate hunters which eat small fish. \nBottlenose dolphins are grey, with dark grey near their \"blowhole\" (the small hole on the top of their head for breathing).

Press reports called him the \"Strong Man of Europe\".\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nBorn as \"Franz Strau\u00df\" in Munich as the second child of a butcher. Strau\u00df studied at the University of Munich from 1935 to 1939.\nHe became a member of the \"NSDStB\" (Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund), (). All students had to be members, or they would not be allowed to study.\nIn World War II, he served in the German army, on the Western and Eastern Fronts. While on , he passed the German state exams to become a teacher. He got severe frostbite on the Eastern Front at the end of 1942, so he became an \"Offizier f\u00fcr wehrgeistige F\u00fchrung\" (political officer) at the anti-aircraft artillery school in Altenstadt, near Schongau, Bavaria.\nSoon after the war he changed his name to Franz Josef Strau\u00df.\nIn 1957 Strau\u00df married Marianne Zwicknagl. They had three children (Max Josef, Franz Georg and Monika). Monika also became a Bavarian minister and member of the Bavarian parliament.\nPolitical life.\nAfter the war, he was appointed deputy \"Landrat\" (county president) of Schongau by the American army, and helped to found the local CSU there.\nHe became a member of the first \"Bundestag\" (Federal Parliament) in 1949 and, in 1953, Federal Minister for Special Affairs in the second cabinet of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1955 he became Federal Minister of Nuclear Energy, and in 1956 defence minister. As defence minister he helped to build-up of the new \"Bundeswehr\".\nHe became chairman of the CSU in 1961.\n\"Der Spiegel\" scandal.\nStrau\u00df had to resign as defence minister in 1962 because of the Spiegel scandal. The important magazine \"Der Spiegel\" said that the Bundeswehr could not defend Germany. Strau\u00df said this was treason and Rudolf Augstein, editor of the magazine, was arrested for 103 days.\nStrau\u00df had to admit that he had lied to the Bundestag, and had to resign. He complained that he was treated like a \"Jew who had dared appear at an NSDAP party convention\".\nRivalry between Kohl and Strau\u00df.\nStrau\u00df became minister of finance in 1966, in the cabinet of Kurt Georg Kiesinger.\nHe worked with the SPD minister for economy, Karl Schiller, but after the SPD was able to form a government without the CDU/CSU, in 1969, Strau\u00df lost his job and became a critic of Willy Brandt's \"Ostpolitik.\"\nIn 1976, when Helmut Kohl failed to become chancellor Strau\u00df cancelled the alliance between the CDU and CSU parties in the Bundestag. He only started the alliance again when the CDU threatened to move into Bavaria.\nIn the 1980 federal election Strau\u00df was the CDU/CSU candidate for chancellor. Some people thought that this showed that the CDU and CSU leaders thought Strau\u00df had better policies and style than Kohl. Others said that the CDU/CSU thought that Helmut Schmidt and the SPD was bound to win the 1980 election, and felt that they had nothing to lose in running Strau\u00df: but it might stop Strau\u00df criticising anyone whon disagreed with him.\nFinal decade of life.\nFrom 1978 until his death in 1988, Strau\u00df was minister president of Bavaria. He served as President of the Bundesrat in 1983/84.\nAfter he lost the 1980 federal election, he left federal politics. But he did not stay quiet, and often commented on federal affairs from his safe seat in Bavaria. He especially criticised Kohl's ideas, even after Kohl ascended to the Chancellorship.\nIn 1983, Strau\u00df helped to arrange a loan of 3 billion Deutschmarks for East Germany. This was not popular, and today it is regarded by some as having artificially prolonged the life of the then-bankrupt communist state.\nVisit to Albania.\nStrau\u00df visited communist Albania on 21 August 1984, while Enver Hoxha, the absolute dictator from the end of World War II until his death in 1985, was still alive. Strau\u00df was one of the few Western leaders to visit Albania in decades. Some thought Strau\u00df might be helping to start diplomatic links between Albania and West Germany but the visit did not result in anything concrete.\nDeath.\nOn 1 October 1988, Strau\u00df collapsed while hunting with the Prince of Thurn and Taxis in the Thurn and Taxis forests, east of Regensburg. He died in a Regensburg hospital on October 3 without having regained consciousness.\nLegacy.\nStrau\u00df was very important in post-war Germany even though he was not very well known outside Germany. He polarized (split) the public like few other politicians.\nA well known spokesman for conservatives, and brilliant speech-maaker, he was a \"red flag\" to the left (his ideas made left wing people very angry).\nHe helped transform Bavaria from a farming state to a centre of technology in Germany. He was an aerospace enthusiast, and supported the Airbus in the 1970s. This is why the new airport in Munich was named after him in 1992 (see Franz Josef Strau\u00df International Airport)."}

He fought against the French Monarchy, the death penalty, and slavery, and for democratic reforms and the people to have more power. He gained a reputation for defending the poor. His friends called him \"incorruptible\" for sticking to his moral values and killing his enemies. Later he was elected president of the powerful Jacobin political group.\nRobespierre led the committee of public safety during 1793. Through it, he was able to execute the king. Even though Robespierre got thousands of people executed, Robespierre cared about the working class.\nHe executed King Louis XVI because he was convicted of treason. Under the advice of Robespierre, the Committee of Public Safety came to control France. The period that the Committee of Public Safety ruled France is known as \u201cThe Reign of Terror\u201d and Maximilien de Robespierre was their leader. In the Thermidorian Reaction Robespierre was caught and executed with 21 of his followers with a guillotine. The National Convention were the people who overthrew Maximilien de Robespierre.\nEarly life.\nMaximilien de Robespierre was born in Arras in the old French province of Artois. His family has been traced back to the 12th century in Picardy; some of his ancestors in the male line worked as notaries in Carvin near Arras from the beginning of the 17th century. It has been suggested that he was of Irish descent, his surname possibly a corruption of \"Robert Speirs\"."}

He was born in a place near Comendador and died in 1845 in a battle near B\u00e1nica.\nLocation.\nEl\u00edas Pi\u00f1a has Dajab\u00f3n to the northwest, Santiago Rodr\u00edguez to the northeast, San Juan to the east and the Independencia province to the south. To the west El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a borders the Republic of Haiti.\nHistory.\nFew people lived in the territory of El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a during colonial times because it was on the border between two colonies: the French \"Saint-Domingue\" and the Spanish \"Santo Domingo\". After 1844, the region became part of the border between Haiti and Dominican Republic.\nThe only town founded during the colony was B\u00e1nica, in the eastern end of a region of many savannas that was called \"Onc\u00e9ano\" by the Spanish; most of Onc\u00e9ano is now part of the Centre Department of Haiti. Both Comendador and Hondo Valle were military posts on the border after the Dominican independence. The rest of the present province had very few people until the end of the Restoration War in 1865 when families from other parts of the country came to live here.\nDuring the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856), Haitian soldiers came across this region; because of that, there were many fights here. The most important fight was La Estrelleta Battle, in a savanna to the east of Comendador.\nSince colonial times, the territory was part of the Azua province until it was changed to the \"Benefactor\" province (now the San Juan province) when this province was created in 1938.\nThe El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a province was created in 1942 with the municipalities of El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a and B\u00e1nica; the new province was named San Rafael and its capital was the city of El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a. In 1965, the name of the province was changed to La Estrelleta and later, in 1972, it was changed to El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a and the capital got its old name of Comendador.\nPedro Santana became a municipality of the province in 1952, El Llano in 1974, Hondo Valle in 1978 and Juan Santiago in 2005.\nThe municipal districts of the province were created in:\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a province, and only 30,429 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km\u00b2, one of the lowest in the country.\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 28th (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province.\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 63,449 inhabitants.\nThe largest city of the province is Comendador, its head municipality or capital, with an urban population (in 2010) of 12,400 inhabitants.\nGeography.\nThe El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a province has a total area of . It has of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 14th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.\nThere are two main roads in the province. One, \"Carretera S\u00e1nchez\" (S\u00e1nchez National Road), goes through the central part of the province from east to west; this is one of the main road of the country and goes from Santo Domingo to the western part of the country, to Comendador.\nThe second main road goes from south to north; it starts in the S\u00e1nchez National Road at \"Matayaya\" (San Juan province) and goes through B\u00e1nica and Pedro Santana and then through the Dajab\u00f3n and Monte Cristi provinces to end in San Fernando de Monte Cristi, on the north coast. This road, for several kilometres north of Pedro Santana, marks the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti and, for that reason, is called \"International Road\".\nThere are other secondary roads. One of them goes from Comendador to Hondo Valle and then to the Independencia province, crossing the Sierra de Neiba mountain range.\nMountains.\nTwo mountain ranges crosses the province from east to west and then into Haiti. The Cordillera Central (\"Central mountain range\") is in the northern part of the province, and the Sierra de Neiba runs across the southern half. The area between those two mountain ranges is composed of several valleys, formed by the Artibonite River and its tributaries, and low mountains (hills).\nThe highest mountain in the province is the \"Loma La Tasajera del Chivito\" at above sea level in the Sierra de Neiba. \"Nalga de Maco\", high (), is the second highest mountain, in the northeast corner of the province, close to the Santiago Rodr\u00edguez province. It is the highest mountain in the western Cordillera Central.\nRivers.\nThe main river is the Artibonite that, in some places, marks the Dominican-Haitian border. Other rivers are Macas\u00edas, Tocino, Joca and Vallecito, all of them tributaries of the Artibonite river. The Ca\u00f1a river is the most important in the southern part of the province, going from south to north; it is a tributary of the Macas\u00edas river.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the province is a tropical climate, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are 6 municipalities and 7 municipal districts (M.D.) in the province. The municipalities and its municipal districts (M.D.) are:\nEconomy.\nAs in all border provinces in the Dominican Republic, there is little economic development. The trade with Haiti is important, mainly in Comendador. On the mountains, coffee and beans are important products. Potatos are also produced in the south (Sierra de Neiba)."}

Released as the first single from Beyonc\u00e9's debut album \"Dangerously in Love\" in mid 2003 (see 2003 in music), it reached number one in the United States and United Kingdom and the top ten on the majority of charts it entered across the world. The song contains a prominent horn sample from The Chi-Lites' 1970 \"Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)\", and serves as the song's hook. Its success established Knowles as a leading solo performer following several years as a member of the band Destiny's Child.\nMusic video.\nThe music video (released in May 2003) was filmed by Jake Nava and does not have a story. The opening scene begins with Knowles wearing a tank top, shorts, and red high-heels. She performs a dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set detailing a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Knowles and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. In a controversial sequence, the video then shifts into its next scene, which shows a helpless Beyonc\u00e9 struggling inside a car. She is apparently unaware that there is a trail of gasoline outside of the car, which Jay-Z ignites, causing the car to explode.\nKnowles does not appear injured; next, she is dancing to Jay-Z's solo rap in an exotic silk print over a fur coat, and decides to kick a fire hydrant. She continues to dance whilst the water is flying all over the place. The video ends with Knowles and her dancers in front of a giant fan in vibrant dresses in contrast to the more neutral colors of the background."}

I don\u2019t understand that. Why do we have to take a backseat? I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men. And let\u2019s face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define value. They define what\u2019s sexy. And men define what\u2019s feminine. It\u2019s ridiculous.\"\nKnowles joined the Ban Bossy campaign in 2014.\nIn December 2013, she and her husband JAY-Z became vegan.

Peter Martyr d'Anghiera wrote that the name was \"Attiboni\" or \"Attibonicus\". Some people said that the name was \"Guayajayuco\" but it is another river, tributary of the Artibonite.\nCourse.\nThe source of the Artibonite is to the northeast of R\u00edo Limpio, in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. The mouth of the Artibonite is in Haiti, south of La Grand Saline, at about . It flows into the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve.\nThe river is the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti for several kilometres, from the town of Pedro Santana to the point where it is joined by the River Macas\u00edas, and then turns west into Haiti.\nIts watershed has an area of 9,013\u00a0km2 (2,614\u00a0km2 in the Dominican Republic, the rest in Haiti). Its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 16.6 cubic metres per second at Pedro Santana.\nTributaries.\nThe most important tributaries are the rivers Lib\u00f3n, Macas\u00edas and Joca, all of them in the Dominican Republic. The Lib\u00f3n River is the only important tributary that flows into the right side of the Artibonite.\nEnvironment.\nDeforestation has affected in a bad way the quality and amount of water in the River Artibonite in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. There are not many fishes; only tilapias are caught. There were American crocodiles (\"Crocodylus acutus\") in the River Artibonite and in other rivers of the Hispaniola, but now they are found only in the big lakes of the island.\nUses.\nThe water of the river is used for irrigation in Haiti but not in the Dominican Republic because it flows here through high mountains. The Peligre Hydroelectric Dam was built on the Arbitonite; it produces electricity for Haiti."}

The Red Sox have played at Fenway Park since 1912\nOne of the American League's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Boston in 1901. They had no real nickname, but were often called the Boston Americans because they played in the American League. Their first home field was the Huntington Avenue Grounds. They met the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first modern World Series, and defeated the Pirates in an upset.\nIn 1907, the Boston National League team stopped using red as their team color. The Americans team color had been blue. The next year, 1908, the Americans adopted red as their color, and officially became the Boston Red Sox.\nIn 1918, the team won its fifth World Series, and then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history. The Red Sox won the World Series in 1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018; they won the pennant, but lost the World Series in 1946, 1967, 1975, and 1986.\nThe Curse of the Bambino.\nMany thought their championship drought between 1918 and 2004 was caused by the \"Curse of the Bambino\", said to have been caused by the trade of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1920. The drought was ended, and the \"curse\" reversed in 2004, when the team won their sixth World Series Championship. \nTo get to the 2004 World Series, they beat the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series; they lost the first three games to the Yankees, but then, facing elimination, they won the next four games and thereby won the ALCS. That was, and still is, the first and only time an MLB team has won a seven-game playoff series after losing the first three games. \nAfter the ALCS, the Red Sox swept the St. Louis Cardinals to win their first World Series since 1918 (86 years) in 2004.\nOther facts.\nThey share a large and very famous rivalry with the New York Yankees. They also share a notably smaller rivalry with the Tampa Bay Rays because of the 2008 American League Championship Series and because of various on-field fights and disputes."}

It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to \"slowly become a woman\" during the video, adding \"Well, a sexier woman \u2014 I'm always a woman.\"\nKnowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars, which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though Knowles is from Texas, she had never previously been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimise the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it was not until 4:00 a.m. that they completed work.\n\"Suga Mama\" was included on the set list of Knowles's 2007 tour, The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience, and \"The Tennessean\" wrote that the song \"was even sexier and more gutbucket than on record\".

It does not hear ordinary criminal cases. Instead it deals with matters that affect the Constitution of Germany.\nThe Court is in Karlsruhe. This was to show it was separate from the federal government, first based in Bonn, and other federal bodies such as the German intelligence (BND) based in Munich.\nCompetence.\nFederal law helps to describe what the court can do, and how it works. Article 20.3 of the \"Grundgesetz\" says that each the three branches of the government \u2013 the parliament, the ministers and the courts \u2013 can only do what the constitution allows. The court can decide that acts of all three branches are not allowed by the constitution and prevent them from happening.\nThere are different reasons the court may find something unconstitutional:\nDecisions of the court on material conflicts are applied through a federal law by the Federal Constitutional Court Act (BVerfGG).\nThe court only hear certain cases:\nOrganization.\nThe court has 16 judges. They are divided into two groups, called senates, of eight judges. The chairman of one senate is also the President of the Court (\"Chief Justice\"). The chairman of the other senate is the vice president. Most cases are heard by a \"chamber\" which is three members of one senate. All three judges of the chamber must agree on a decision. A chamber has to use precedent (\"past rulings\"). If a chamber thinks a precedent should be changed they have to let the case be decided by the Senate as a whole. Similarly, if a Senate thinks a precedent set by the other Senate should be changed precedent of the must ask the \"Plenum\" (a meeting of all 16 judges).\nDecisions by a Senate need an absolute majority of 5 votes (in some cases a two-thirds majority is required, that is, 6 out of 8 votes). The BVerfGG decides which type of cases a senate hears.\nElection of judges.\nFour judges of each senate are elected by the Bundestag. The others are elected by the Bundesrat. Choosing a judge needs a two-thirds majority.\nThe judges have a 12-year term, but they must retire when reaching the age of 68. A judge must be at least 40 years old and must be a well-trained jurist. Three out of eight members of each Senate must have been a judge of a Federal Supreme Court. Of the other five members of each Senate, most judges have been a professor of law at a university, a public servant or a lawyer.\nAt the end of their term, most judges retire from public life. One notable exception was Roman Herzog, who was elected Federal President in 1994, shortly before the end of his term as President of the Court."}

Muslims believe that the Kaaba was built by the command of Allah. The Kaaba\u2019s original architecture has remained the same for centuries.\nHistory.\nBefore Prophet Muhammad.\nAccording to Islamic sources, the Kaaba was a place of worship for angels before the creation of men. After the creation of Adam, the Kaaba was built by him. According to Qur'an, it is the first house on Earth. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Kaaba was buried under the sand by the Noah's flood. After a period of time, it was rebuilt by Prophet Abraham and his son, Prophet Ishmael.The Kaaba was a place of monotheism for centuries. Then Amr bin Luhayy brought an idol to the Kaaba. After that, the Kaaba became a place of pagan belief.\nAfter Prophet Muhammad.\n\u00a0 The Kaaba began to be managed by Muslims in 630 AD. Prophet Muhammad removed the idols. Also, the Kaaba was cleaned with sacred water (Zamzam) under his guidance.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The general architecture of the Kaaba remained the same until 1630 because people wanted to keep the original architecture. Only simple repairs and small decorations were made during this long period of time. In 1630, three walls of the Kaaba were heavily damaged by a storm. Then, it was restored by Murad IV, 17th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The Kaaba has remained the same after this renovation.\nReligious Significance.\nThe Kaaba is the holiest place in Islam. Muslims believe that the Kaaba is the House of God (Baitullah). Prophet Mohammed said the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is one of the three most important mosques on the Earth. \nMuslims are required to make a pilgrimage (hajj) once in a lifetime to the Kaaba.

It wanted to establish a separate nation-state for the Basque people. The Basque people are an ethnic group living in areas of northern Spain and southwestern France. There are between 2 and 2.5 million Basques in the region. Some of them speak an indigenous, non-Indo-European language called Euskara.\nDescription.\nETA was one of Europe\u2019s most notorious and long-running terror groups. It was founded in 1959 from what was left of EKIN, another radical Basque separatist group. Both EKIN and ETA were created because of discontent with the moderate nationalism of the main Basque party, the Basque National Party. ETA committed hundreds of attacks in Spain. It had ties with other terrorist groups both inside and outside the Basque region. These included the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Colombia\u2019s FARC.\nAttacks.\nMost of ETA\u2019s terror attacks targeted businesses and Spanish government officials, especially members of the security services and the judiciary, but it also targeted civilians. Its most common tactics were bombing and assassination. Its attacks took place mostly in the Basque Country, Madrid and Catalonia. Similar to the IRA, ETA sometimes issued warnings before the attacks.\nThe group assassinated Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco in December 1973. At the time, Blanco was seen by many as the most likely successor to Spain\u2019s dictator, Francisco Franco. He was killed when an underground bomb exploded underneath his car. More than twenty years later, ETA nearly assassinated Jose Maria Aznar, an opposition politician who later became prime minister. In 1987, ETA killed 21 people in Barcelona using a car bomb.\nStatus change.\nThe status of the Basque homeland changed significantly with the end of Francisco Franco's regime and the return of democracy in 1979. Franco tried to suppress Basque nationalism and separatism. The new democratic government, on the other hand, offered significant autonomy to the Basque provinces. In a deal struck in 1980, the Basque region acquired its own parliament similarly to the other regions in Spain. It was also allowed to have its own independent tax legislation. In addition, the language Euskara became more prominent in public culture and education. However, the new autonomous region did not deter the radical separatists that comprised ETA. ETA has committed approximately 900 murders and dozens of kidnappings.\nChange of activity.\nETA\u2019s level of activity has changed over the years. The group has attempted several ceasefires, including a 14-month one that lasted until December 1999. While there have been a number of ETA attacks since 2000, the group has claimed fewer victims. It is believed to be shrinking. Spanish officials believe that recent crackdowns have led to a serious weakening of the group and sense that its future as a terrorist organization may be limited. There are more than one hundred suspected ETA members in Spanish prisons today.\n2000s.\nIn the past several years, ETA has done sporadic attacks, including bombings in September 2004, December 2005, and early 2006. However, these bombings were generally preceded by warnings and did not result in any deaths.\nIn March 2006, ETA declared a permanent ceasefire and expressed to join the political process. The decision may have been linked to the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which killed nearly 200 people. The attack was originally blamed on ETA, though it was soon discovered to be the work of militant Islamists linked to al-Qaeda. Like the IRA, ETA leaders may have felt that the mass casualty terrorism practiced by some radical Islamist groups discredited its violent tactics\u2014though this is not known for certain. ETA had a secretive leadership structure.\nIn June 2007, ETA declared its March 2006 ceasefire null-and-void. Although many had seen ETA\u2019s December 2006 bombing of an airport parking garage as an indication that the truce would not hold. An ETA spokesperson accused the Spanish government of interfering in Basque local elections as well as continuing with the prosecution and conviction of ETA members during the ceasefire.\nIt must be noted that ETA did not officially renounce violence or initiate steps to decommission its weapons (as the IRA did in July 2005) as part of its ceasefire declaration. ETA ceasefires have deteriorated into violence before.\n2010s.\nOn 20 October 2011, ETA announced publicly the definite cessation of its armed activities. Although it vowed to continue to seek an independent Basque state. It was announced in 2 prominent nationalist newspapers, Gara and Berria.\nIn May 2018 ETA announced that it was formally disbanding. The move marked the end of a half-century of violence that had claimed the lives of more than 800 people. "}

Many musicians think of him as the most important Czech composer of the late 20th century. He was known world wide for his organ playing. He was especially good at improvisation.\nHis Life.\nEben grew up in \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov in south Bohemia. He learned to play the piano, and later the cello and organ. Because his father was a Jew he had to leave school in 1943 and spent the rest of the war years in concentration camp in Buchenwald. In the camp he saw many terrible things, including graves into which the Nazis were throwing lots of murdered Jews. These terrible things influenced his music in later years. He had a strong faith and this helped him to survive during 40 years of living in Czechoslovakia under communist rule.\nAfter the war he went to Prague Academy for Music where he studied the piano with Franti\u0161ek Rauch and composition with Pavel Bo\u0159kovec. In 1955 he got a job as lecturer at Charles University in Prague. He stayed there until 1990. He was the country\u2019s best composer, and he should have had promotion, but the communist politicians did not allow this. He went to church every Sunday with his family. This did not help his career in a communist state.\nAfter the Velvet Revolution in 1989, when his country became free from the Soviet Union, he started to become a national hero. He was made Professor of Composition and president of the Prague Spring Music Festival. Many music festivals performed his compositions, and he traveled to hear the concerts in spite of the fact that he was starting to become ill. His music was often played in England, where he had spent two years as professor of composition at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester from 1978 to 1979. In March 2007 the BBC Symphony Orchestra under their Czech conductor Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek performed his \"Vox Clamantis\", a work he had written in 1968 which shows the Czech people\u2019s longing to be free.\nHis compositions.\nEben continued during his lifetime to develop the style of music in which he wrote. He was interested in Czech folk music and he wrote down many folk songs that he heard in Moravia. He listened to plainchant in church music. All this helped him to develop his own style of composition. He is best-known abroad for his organ music, especially works such as \"Musica Dominicalis\" (\"Sunday Music\") which includes a popular piece called \"Moto Ostinato\". Other organ works include \"Faust\" (1980), \"Job\" (1987) and \"A Festive Voluntary\" which is a set of variations on the tune of \"Good King Wenceslas\", written for the reopening in 1986 of the organ at Chichester Cathedral which had just been restored. He also wrote a lot of music for orchestra as well as chamber music. He composed some beautiful music for children\u2019s choir, including church music called \"Liturgical Songs\"."}

No elections are held, or if they are, candidates must be approved by the ruling group. Physical force and/or arrests and detentions are used on people who protest against the regime. There are events such as parades or rallies. These suggest to the people that the ruling group is in complete control.\nFor some, totalitarianism is as old as history. However, their main examples in modern times are Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, North Korea, the Soviet Union, Eritrea and China. \nThere are other countries which had dictatorships, but never reached full totalitarianism. Italian fascism under Benito Mussolini, Spain under General Franco, Portugal under Dr. Salazar, China under Mao Zedong, and many Latin American countries for periods were dictatorships with some aspects of totalitarianism. Some African countries have been dictatorships for long periods (e.g. Zimbabwe). The Empire of Japan (predecessor state of the modern nation-state of Japan) was a well-known example of a totalitarian military dictatorship during World War II. The satire \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" by George Orwell was about such a society taken to extremes.\nThe list is long: it is not true that most countries today are democratic.\nAccording to some, authoritarianism \"does not attempt to change the world and human nature\". In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens."}

He rejoined the German army at the start of the First World War. He became famous when he won the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914.\nHindenburg retired again in 1919, but returned to public life one more time in 1925 to be elected as the second President of Germany.\nHe was 84 years old and in poor health, but deciced to run for re-election in 1932 as the only candidate who could defeat Adolf Hitler, because he saw him as a dangerous extremist. He tried to stop Hitler's and the Nazi Party's rise to power, but Franz von Papen persuaded Hindenburg, that the Conservative elite and the military could control Hitler when he becomes Chancellor of Germany and that the other more dangerous alternative was Communist rule. \nAs a result, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. But von Papen's belief in controlling Hitler and his assurances to Hindenburg did not happen, because Hitler started to control them and gain more power. In March he signed the Enabling Act of 1933 which gave special powers to Hitler and his government. \nWith this act, Hitler became a dictator in the next months, and crushed all opposition and banned all political parties, except the Nazi Party by the summer of 1933. Hindenburg died the next year, after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and made himself F\u00fchrer (Head of State and Head of Government) of Germany.\nThe famous zeppelin \"Hindenburg\" that was destroyed by fire in 1937 had been named in his honour, as is the causeway joining the island of Sylt to mainland Schleswig-Holstein, the Hindenburgdamm, built during his time in office.\nPresidency.\n1925 election.\nIn 1925, Hindenburg had no interest in running for public office. After the first round Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, one of the leaders of the DNVP, visited Hindenburg and asked him to run.\nHindenburg eventually agreed to run in the second round of the elections as a non-party independent, although he was a conservative. Because he was Germany's greatest war hero, Hindenburg won the election in the second round of voting held on 26 April 1925.\nHe was helped when the Bavarian People's Party (BVP), switched its support from Marx, the SPD candidate and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) to did not withdraw its candidate, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann. If they had their supporters would most likely have voted for the SPD and Hindenburg may not have won.\nFirst term.\nHindenburg tried to stay out of day-to-politics, and be a ceremonial president. He liked the monarchy, but took his oath to the Weimar Constitution seriously.\nHindenburg often complained that he missed the quiet of his retirement and, that politics was full of ideas like economics that he did not understand.\nHis advisers included his son, Oskar, his old army aide General Wilhelm Groener, and General Kurt von Schleicher. The younger Hindenburg served as his father's aide-de-camp and controlled politicians' access to the President.\nSchleicher came up with the idea of \"Presidential government\", and the \"25/48/53 formula\".\nUnder a \"Presidential\" government the chancellor is responsible to the president), and not the Reichstag. The \"25/48/53 formula\" was the three articles of the Constitution that could make a \"Presidential government\" possible:\nSchleicher's wanted to have Hindenburg appoint a chancellor that Schleicher chose. If that chancellor needed any laws he could use article 48. If the Reichstag should threaten to cancel any of those laws, Hindenburg could threaten a dissolution, and call new elections. Hindenburg did not like the idea, but was pressured into going along with them by his son and his other advisors.\nPresidential government.\nThe first try at \"presidential government\" in 1926\u20131927 failed for lack of political support. During the winter of 1929\u20131930, Schleicher had a series of secret meetings with Heinrich Br\u00fcning, the leader of the Catholic Center Party (\"Zentrum\").\nSchleicher then set about splitting the \"Grand Coalition\" government of the Social Democrats and the German People\u2019s Party. As a result, the government fell in March 1930 and Br\u00fcning was named Chancellor by Hindenburg.\nBr\u00fcning's first act was to introduce a budget calling for steep spending cuts and sharp tax increases. When the budget was defeated in July, Br\u00fcning had Hindenburg sign the budget as an emergency law under Article 48. When the Reichstag voted to cancel the budget, Br\u00fcning had Hindenburg dissolve Reichstag only two years into its mandate, and had the budget passed again by Article 48. The Nazis got 17% of the vote in the September 1930 elections. The Communist Party of Germany also made gains.\nBr\u00fcning ruled through Article 48; the Social Democrats never voted not to cancel his Article 48 bills in order not to have another election that could only benefit the Nazis and the Communists.\n1932 Election.\nIn the first round of the election held in March 1932, Hindenburg was the frontrunner, but did not have an absolute majority. In the runoff election of April 1932, Hindenburg beat Hitler for the Presidency.\nAfter the presidential elections had ended, Schleicher held a series of secret meetings with Hitler in May 1932, and thought that Hitler had agreed to support the new \"presidential government\" Schleicher was building.\nIn May 1932 Schleicher had Hindenburg sack Groener as Defence Minister to humiliate both Groener and Br\u00fcning. On 31 May 1932, Hindenburg sacked Br\u00fcning as Chancellor and replaced him with Schleicher's suggestion, Franz von Papen.\nvon Papen's government openly wanted to destroy German democracy. Like Br\u00fcning's government, von Papen's government was a \"presidential government\" that governed through the use of Article 48.\nAs Schleicher wanted, Hindenburg dissolved the Reichstag and set new elections for July 1932. Schleicher and von Papen both believed that the Nazis would win the majority of the seats and would support von Papen's government.\nThe Nazi party did become the largest party in the Reichstag, and expected Hitler would be Chancellor. When Hindenburg met Hitler on 13 August 1932, in Berlin, Hindenburg rejected Hitler's demands for the Chancellorship.\nThe minutes of the meeting were kept by Otto Mei\u00dfner, the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery. According to the minutes:\nHindenburg issued a press release about his meeting with Hitler that seemed to say that Hitler had demanded absolute power and that the President had refused. Hitler was enraged by this press release.\nWhen the Reichstag met in September 1932, its first and only act was to pass a massive vote of no-confidence in von Papen\u2019s government. In response, von Papen had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag for elections in November 1932. In the 1949 constitution, a vote of no confidence must be accompanied by the election of a new chancellor, so this could not happen.\nIn the second Reichstag elections of 1932 the Nazis lost some support, but stayed the largest party in the Reichstag. There ensued another round of talks between Hindenburg, von Papen, von Schleicher on the one hand and Hitler and the other Nazi leaders on the other.\nHitler still demanded that Hindenburg give him the Chancellorship. Hindenburg could not accept this, so von Papen suggested Hindenburg declare martial law and do away with democracy.\nVon Papen got Oscar Hindenburg to support the plan, and they persuaded the president to ignore his oath to the Constitution and go along with this plan. Schleicher saw von Papen as a threat so he blocked the martial law plan by saying it would make the Nazi SA and the Communist Red Front Fighters rebel, and that the Poles would invade and the Reichswehr would be unable to cope.\nHindenburg hated the idea of Hitler as Chancellor, but under pressure from Mei\u00dfner, von Papen and Oskar Hindenburg the President decided to appoint Hitler Chancellor. On the morning of 30 January 1933, Hindenburg swore Hitler in as Chancellor at the Presidential Palace.\nThe \"Machtergreifung\".\nHindenburg played key role in the Nazi \"Machtergreifung\" (Seizure of Power) in 1933. He was not involved in the planning, but did not stop Hitler. In the \"Government of National Concentration\" headed by Hitler, the Nazis were in the minority. Most of the ministers were from the von Papen and von Schleicher governments. Besides Hitler, the only other Nazi ministers were Hermann G\u00f6ring and Wilhelm Frick.\nHindenburg thought that the Nazis' power was limited, especially as his favourite politician, von Papen, was the Vice-Chancellor and the Reich Commissioner for Prussia.\nHitler's first act as Chancellor was to ask Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag so that the Nazis and D.N.V.P. could increase their number of seats, Hindenburg agreed.\nIn early February 1933, von Papen had an Article 48 bill signed into law that limited the freedom of press. After the Reichstag fire, Hindenburg signed into law the \"Reichstag Fire Decree\".\nAt the opening of the new \"Reichstag\" on 21 March 1933, at the Kroll Opera House, the Nazis staged an elaborate ceremony, in which Hindenburg played the leading part, that was meant to mark the continuity between the Prussian-German tradition and the new Nazi state.\nThe ceremony at the Kroll Opera House had the effect of reassuring many Germans, especially conservative Germans, that life would be fine under the new regime. On 23 March 1933, Hindenburg signed the Enabling Act into law.\nHindenburg was still very popular, but his health was getting worse. The Nazis made sure that whenever Hindenburg did appear in public Hitler was with him, and that Hitler was always very respectful to the President. The Nazi propagandists hoped people would think Hindenburg liked Hitler, and Hitler would become more popular.\nThe only time Hindenburg ever tried to stop a Nazi bill was in early April 1933. The Reichstag had passed a \"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\". This said that all Jewish civil servants working for the \"Reich\", the \"L\u00e4nder\", or the local districts should be sacked immediately.\nHindenburg refused to sign this bill into law unless all Jewish veterans of World War I, Jewish civil servants who served in the civil service during the war and those Jewish civil servants whose fathers were veterans were allowed to stay in office. Hitler agreed, in order to get the law signed, even though he believed that the Jews had tried to undermine Germany during the Great War. It was Hindenburg who said that Germany lost the First World War because of politicians and others \"stabbing the Army in the back\". Hindenburg did not believe the story. He said it so that his wartime deputy Erich von Ludendorff would not write bad things in his memoirs. But Hitler did believe the story, and used it to gain power.\nHindenburg stayed president until he died from lung cancer at his home in \"Neudeck\", East Prussia on 2 August 1934.\nOne day before Hindenburg's death, Hitler flew to \"Neudeck\" and visited him. Hindenburg, old and senile, thought he was meeting Kaiser Wilhelm II, and called Hitler \"Your Majesty\".\nHe would be Germany's last president until 1945, when Karl D\u00f6nitz was appointed president in Hitler's last will. Following Hindenburg's death, Hitler declared the office of President to be permanently vacant, effectively merging it with the office of Chancellor under the title of Leader and Chancellor (\"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\"), making himself Germany's Head of State and Head of government.\nBurial.\nHindenburg was buried in the Tannenberg memorial near Tannenberg, East Prussia (today: St\u0119bark, Poland). But Hindenburg always said he wanted to be buried next to his wife. In 1945, German troops removed his and his wife's coffins, to save them from the approaching Soviet troops, and blew up the memorial with explosives."}

{"id": "75783", "revid": "276752", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75783", "title": "Cy Young", "text": "Denton True \"Cy\" Young (March 29, 1867 \u2013 November 4, 1955) was an American baseball player. He was a pitcher for five different professional baseball teams from 1890 to 1911. He set many pitching records during his 22-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB), some of which have stood for 100 years. When Young retired from baseball, he had won a total of 511 games in his career, the most in MLB history and 94 more wins than Walter Johnson, who is second on the list.\nIn 1956, the MLB created the Cy Young Award. The award is given each year to the pitcher who is voted the most effective in each of the two leagues. Young was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. During his professional career, Young won 30 or more games in a season five times, with ten other seasons of 20+ wins. He also pitched three no-hitters, including the first perfect game of baseball's \"modern era.\"\nIn addition to wins, Young holds the MLB records for most career innings pitched (7,355), most career games started (815), and most complete games (749). He also retired with 316 losses, the most in MLB history (the only other pitcher with more than 300 career losses was Pud Galvin). Young also had 76 career shutouts, the fourth most in history.\nIn 1999, 88 years after his final Major League appearance and 44 years after his death, editors at \"The Sporting News\" ranked Cy Young 14th on their list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\". That same year, baseball fans named Young to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.\nEarly life.\nYoung was born in Gilmore, Ohio, a farming community in eastern Ohio. Young went by the name \"Dent Young\" in his early years.\nHe was raised on a farm and was sometimes called \"Farmer Young\" and \"Farmboy Young\". Young stopped going to school after he finished 6th grade. \nProfessional career.\nYoung began his professional career in 1889 with the Canton, Ohio team of the Tri-State League, a professional minor league. The catcher who warmed up Young gave him the nickname \"Cyclone\" because of the speed of his fastball. Reporters then shortened the name to \"Cy\". \"Cy\" became the nickname which he used the rest of his life.\nIn 1890, Young signed for $500 with the Cleveland Spiders, which had moved up from the American Association to the National League the previous year. \nTwo years later, the National League moved the pitcher's mound from away from the home plate (where it had been since 1881) to . In the book \"The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers\", sports journalist Rob Neyer wrote that the reason for the move was that pitchers like Cy Young, Amos Rusie, and Jouett Meekin threw too fast at the shorter distance.\nOn September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders committed four errors while on defense.\nBefore the 1899 season, Frank Robison, the owner of the Spiders, bought the St. Louis Browns, thus owning two clubs at the same time. Just weeks before the start of the season, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers: Young, Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace. Despite the changes in the team members, St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900. The Spiders lost 134 games, the most in MLB history, before folding. \nIn 1901, Young left St. Louis and joined the American League's Boston Americans for a $3,500 contract. Young stayed with the Boston team until 1909. \nYoung was traded back to Cleveland before the 1909 season, this time to the Cleveland Naps of the American League. He split 1911, his final year, between the Naps and the Boston Rustlers. \nOn September 22, 1911, Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates and their pitcher Babe Adams 1-0, for his last career win. However, two weeks later, Young's 906th and final game ended badly: the last eight batters of Young's career combined to hit a triple, four singles and three doubles.\nYoung's legacy.\nYoung retired after the 1911 season with 511 career wins. His win total set the record for most career wins by a pitcher. At the time, Pud Galvin had the second most career wins with 364. Walter Johnson, then in his fourth season, finished his career with 417 wins and is now second on the list. However, Johnson broke Young's career record for strikeouts.\nCy Young's career is seen as a bridge from baseball's earliest days to its modern era. When Young's career began, pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes. The pitcher's mound was not moved back to its present position of 60 feet, six inches until Young's fourth season. He did not wear a glove until his sixth.\nParticularly after his fastball slowed, Young's success relied upon his great control. Young said:\nBy habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. \"I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it,\" said Young, \"and there wasn't any use wasting them.\" Young once described his approach before a game:\nYoung also said that his offseason farming chores, including wood chopping, kept his pitching arm in good shape until he was 44. Even at the time of his retirement, his arm was healthy, but Young had gained weight and was unable to field his position anymore. In three of his last four years, he was the oldest player in the league.\nThe first Cy Young Award was voted on in 1956, and was given to Brooklyn's Don Newcombe. Originally, it was a single award covering the whole of baseball. The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967, one for each league.\nYoung was saluted in the poem \"Lineup for Yesterday\" by Ogden Nash:\n\"Y is for Young,\" \n\"The magnificent Cy;\" \n\"People batted against him,\" \n\"But I never knew why.\""}

{"id": "75794", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75794", "title": "Arabic alphabet", "text": "The Arabic alphabet is an abjad that is used to write several languages of the Middle East such as Arabic, Persian, Pashto and Urdu. The script is the third most widely used script in the world, after the Latin and Chinese scripts.\nOverview.\nThe script is written from right to left. When it is used to write the Arabic language, the script has 28 different characters. Usually only consonants are written in an abjad. Vowels are omitted most of the time. The Arabic script is a cursive script. This means that letters of a word are joined together, both in handwriting and in print. Each letter can have up to four different forms. Which of the forms is used depends on the letters before and after it. There is no different form for uppercase letters and lowercase letters. \nThere are two basic modern variants of the Arabic script. One is called Naskh, it is the one commonly used for printing. The most common script in everyday life is called Kufic, after the city Kufa, in Iraq, where it was developed. There are several variants of both scripts.\nNumbers.\nThe alphabet can also be used to write numbers, which was common in the Middle Ages. They are less used today and usually replaced by Latin-alphabet (\"Arabic\") numbers. \nWhen the alphabet is used to write numbers, ' is 1, ' is 2, ' is 3 and so on until ' = 10, ' = 20, ' = 30, \u2026, ' = 200, \u2026, ' = 1000. That is sometimes used to produce chronograms in which specific letters, interpreted as numerals, stand for a particular date when they are rearranged.\nSort order.\nFor dictionaries, it is necessary to put the letters into a predetermined sequence, which is usually called sort order, or alphabetical order. The Arabic script has two sort orders: The one, \"abjid\", derives from the position of the letters in the Phoenician alphabet. The other, \"hij\u0101,\" sorts letters by similarity of shape.\nHistory.\nAs Islam spread throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia, Arabic spread along with it. Islam requires its followers to learn Arabic because it states that Gabriel (Jibril) spoke the words of Allah to Muhammad in Arabic. The language is used for Muslim rituals such as prayer and the reciting of Quranic verses. As Arabic spread, the Quran's script also spread. It replaced the Pahlavi writing system as Islam conquered Persia.\nAnother alphabet, the Uighur alphabet, was based on the shapes of Arabic letters. However, the Uighur alphabet always has vowel letters, unlike in Arabic.\nAfter the fall of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, use of the Arabic language and alphabet, became less common in the Muslim world. The Turkic states and other Muslim-majority states controlled by the Soviet Union did not favour Arabic script. In 1928, Turkey passed a law that banned the use of the Arabic alphabet for writing Turkish, which is now written with the Latin alphabet. \nAround the same time, the Soviet Union created a Latin alphabet for the Central Asian states that it occupied: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The decision to replace the Arabic alphabet was amdre to remove religious influence in Central Asia and to modernise the region. For a time, Soviet leaders, including Vladimir Lenin, believed the Latin alphabet was the \"world alphabet\" because it was the writing system of most developed countries. However, the Soviet Union then required the Central Asian states to write only in the Cyrillic script. That was to influence local cultures and languages to become more like those of Russia. \nAlthough the Soviet Union fell, none of the Central Asian nations returned to using the Arabic alphabet. They either kept using Cyrillic, like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, or adopted a new Latin alphabet, like Azerbaijan. Only Tajikistan is considering switching back to using the Arabic alphabet. Tajik was once a dialect of Persian.\nIn Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei have all adoptedfor Malay the Latin alphabet, which is called \"Rumi\" in Malay. The British and Dutch colonialists introduced the Latin alphabet. The Arabic alphabet (\"Jawi\" in Malay) is still used in Malaysia but much less than Rumi. Brunei is the only Southeast Asian country in which both the Latin and Arabic alphabets are co-official."}

It is the only remaining gate through which people used to enter Berlin. It was built between 1788 and 1791. It is located between the Platz des 18. M\u00e4rz and the Pariser Platz. Nearby to the north is the Reichstag building. During the Cold War, the Reichstag was in West Berlin, and the Brandenburger Tor in East Berlin.\nThe Brandenburg Gate has twelve columns, six on the entrance side and six on the exit. The columns form five roadways, citizens originally were allowed to use only the outer two. This is rather like Admiralty Arch in London, the central roadway is reserved so that royal and important traffic is not delayed. On top of the gate is the Quadriga. This is Viktoria, the goddess of victory driving a Quadriga, a type of horse-drawn chariot.\nAfter 1806, when Prussia was defeated at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon stole the Quadriga and took it to Paris. When Napoleon was beaten in 1814 Prussian General Ernst von Pfuel occupied Pais and took the Quadriga back to Berlin, the olive wreath was changed to an Iron Cross. The Goddess Viktoria became Nike, goddess of victory.\nWhen the Nazis came to power, they used the Gate as their symbol. The Gate was damaged but not destroyed during World War II. The governments of East Berlin and West Berlin restored it but it was closed when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The gate was in the middle of the death strip.\nIn 1963, U.S. President John F. Kennedy visited the Brandenburg Gate. The Soviets hung large banners across it to prevent him from looking into the East. In the 1980s West Berlin mayor Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker said: \nIn 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan gave his famous speech \"Tear down this wall!\" outside of the gate.\nVon Weizs\u00e4cker was the President of Germany at the reunification.\nThe Gate then symbolized the freedom to unite the City of Berlin. On the 22nd of December 1989, the Brandenburg Gate re-opened when Helmut Kohl, the West German Chancellor, walked through to be greeted by Hans Modrow, the East German Prime Minister.\nOn December 21, 2000, the Brandenburg Gate was privately refurbished at a cost of US$3 million."}

It is in the provinces of East Azarbaijan and West Azarbaijan, and is southwest of the close shaped Caspian Sea. It is the largest lake inside Iran, and the second biggest salt lake of the world. It is the largest lake in the Middle East.\nThe location of Lake Urmia is at . It has a surface area of about 5,200 km\u00b2 (2,000 mile\u00b2). At its biggest extent, it is about 140\u00a0km (87 miles) long, and 55\u00a0km (34 miles) wide. Its deepest point is approximately 16 m (52 ft) deep. It receives water from thirteen rivers coming from the near mountains, and it has no output.\nLake Urmia lies between West Azarbaijan and East Azarbaijan provinces. Tabriz is the biggest city to its east, and Urmia is the biggest city to its west. The shortest way between these cities is to go round the lake. In 1970s a project was started to create a bridge across the lake. This project was canceled when Islamic Revolution happened in 1979. However, the project was started again in 2000s; it is planned to be finished by the end of 2007.\nThe lake has a very salty water. The concentration of salt is different in each season of the year; it may be 26-28% in the late Autumn.\nLake Urmia is getting smaller and smaller each year. This is because the rivers which bring water to it have become smaller.\nHistory.\nThis lake was historically named Chaychast (Persian: \u0686\u06cc\u0686\u0633\u062a). Later, it was named \"Urmia\" by the Assyrian people. The word \"Urmia\" consists of two parts: \"ur\" means city and \"mia\" means water. \"Urmia\" was the name given to the city of Urmia, which is near this lake. The lake was then named Lake Urmia, after the name given to the city. In the early years of the 20th century, it was named \"Rezaiyeh Lake\" after the name of Reza Pahlavi, the king of Iran. After the Islamic Revolution, its name was changed back to \"Urmia Lake\".\nLife near Lake Urmia.\nDifferent creatures live inside or near this lake, including some species of shrimps, amphibians and birds like flamingos and pelicans.\nUrmia Lake has shallow borders with lots of mud. Different creatures live inside the mud, including frogs, snails and worms. The mud is said to have good effects in treatment of some diseases of the joints.\nIslands.\nLake Urmia has 102 islands.

It is over 4180 km (2500 miles) long. It has a crescent shape and it goes through Guinea, Mali, Niger, on the border with Benin and then through Nigeria. Finally, it reaches the sea at a large delta, called the Niger Delta of the Oil Rivers. This part of the Atlantic Ocean is called the Gulf of Guinea. The Niger is the third-longest river in Africa. Only by the Nile and the Congo are longer. Its main tributary is the Benue River.\nEtymology.\nNo-one knows the origin of the name Niger. Many people think that it comes from the Latin word for \"black\", \"niger\", but there is no evidence for this, and Portuguese explorers would probably have used their own word (\"negro\") on their maps. Also, the Niger is not a blackwater river (see Rio Negro). Some people think that 'black' may mean the color of the people in this area, but this did not happen with any other river in Africa.\nTherefore, most people think the name is from the original people of the area in the middle of the river where early European maps used the name \"Quorra\". One possibility is the Tuareg phrase \"gher n gheren\" \"river of rivers\", shortened to \"ngher\" or \"niger\", from the middle of the river near Timbuktu.\nThe Tabula Peutingeriana says \"Flumen Girin\" (River Girin) and \"Hoc flumen quidam Grin vocant, alii Nilum appellant dicint enim sub terra Etyopium in Nilum ire Lacum.\", which means \"This river which some are naming Grin is called Nile by others and is thought to flow under the ground of Ethiopia (i.e. modern Africa) into the Nile Lake.\"\nNigeria and Niger take their names from the river. The people who live beside the river have many names for it, such as \"Jeliba\" or \"Joliba\" (\"great river\" in Manding), \"Isa Ber\" (\"big river\" in Songhay), \"Oya,\" (a Yoruba River Niger goddess), and \"Kworra\" or \"Quorra.\" The last name was the name that Europeans used for the lower part of the river before they knew that the upper and lower parts were connected.\nGeography.\nThe Niger River is quite a clear river. It has only 10% as much sediment as the Nile because the Niger's source is in very old rocks that have little silt. Like the Nile, the Niger River has a flood every year; this starts in September, becomes strongest in November, and finishes by May.\nAn unusual feature of the river is the Niger Inland Delta. This forms where the river suddenly becomes less steep. This makes a region of connected streams, marshes, and lakes over an amount of land the same size as Belgium. The yearly floods make the delta very good for fishing and farming.\nThe Niger takes an unusual route. It is a boomerang shape and this confused Europeans for 2000 years. Its source is only 240 km (150 miles) from the Atlantic Ocean, but the river flows away from the sea into the Sahara Desert, then turns near the ancient city of Timbuktu (Tombouctou). From here, it goes southeast to the Gulf of Guinea.\nAncient Romans thought that the river near Timbuktu was part of the Nile River and Ibn Battuta had the same opinion. Early 17th-century European explorers thought that it flowed west and joined the S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River. Many local people probably knew the real route, but Europeans only knew it in the late 19th century, when it was mentioned in the book \"Travels in the Interior of Africa\" by the Scottish explorer Mungo Park. This unusual route happened because the Niger River is two ancient rivers which are joined together. The upper Niger, from the source, past Timbuktu, to the bend in the river, used to empty into a lake, but the lake has now gone. However, the lower Niger started in hills near the lake and flowed south into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sahara Desert dried up in 4000-1000 BC, and the two rivers changed their routes and they joined (some people disagree, but most people think this is true).\nThe northern part of the river, which is called the \"Niger bend\", is important because it is the Sahara Desert's closest big river. Therefore, trade across the west of the Sahara came here, and it became the center of the Sahelian kingdoms of Mali and Gao."}

There are several types of ornaments, including trills and slides. Music of the Renaissance and Baroque periods have lots of ornaments. The composer usually shows what ornaments are needed by little signs written above the notes. In some pieces, especially in slow movements, the composers often did not show the ornaments that are needed: they expected the performers to put them in themselves. Understanding the correct way of ornamenting music used to be a very important part of the art of singing or playing a musical instrument.\nThe correct way of ornamenting music varied a lot from one country to another and from one century to another. Ideas about how music should be performed kept changing. It is important for musicians today, who want to play music from these older periods, to know as much as possible about historical musical styles. Sometimes we have to make guesses about what a composer might have wanted. Fortunately several composers and music theorists wrote books about how to play ornaments. This enables us to understand the different performing styles. Sometimes composers wrote a preface (introduction) in their music to explain to the performer how to play the ornaments they had written.\nThere are different kinds of ornaments. A \u201cgrace note\u201d is a note written in smaller print, to show that its note value (how long it lasts) does not count as part of the total time value of the measure. \nIn Spain, these ornaments were called \"diferenzias\". They were used as early as the 16th century, when the first books with music for the guitar were produced. In French music they were called \"agr\u00e9ments\".\nOrnaments were still written in music from the Classical music period although they are gradually used less and less as composers started to write precisely all the notes that were to be played. By the Romantic period they were hardly being used except for \u201ctr\u201d meaning \u201ctrill\u201d.\nTypes of Baroque/Classical ornaments.\nTrill.\nA trill is a quick alternation between the main note and the note above it. It was also known as a \"shake\". Usually, if the music was written before 1800 the trill is played by starting a note above the written note. If the music was written after 1800 then the trill is usually played by starting on the note written and going up to the note above. This was not, of course, a firm rule: changes in performance style happened gradually. \nSometimes the trill ends with a turn (the note above, the main note, the note below, the main note).\nThe trill is shown in musical notation by either a formula_1 or a formula_1~~, with the ~ representing the length of the trill, above the staff.\nMordent.\nThe mordent is like a very short trill, usually just the main note, the note above, and the main note again. If the middle note is the note below, this is called an \u201cinverted mordent\u201d or \u201clower mordent\u201d. \nThe upper mordent is indicated by a short squiggle (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent is the same with a short vertical line through it:\nAs with the trill, the exact speed with which the mordent is played will depend on the speed of the piece, but at a moderate speed the above might be played like this:\nTurn.\nA short figure consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and the note itself again. It is marked by a mirrored S-shape lying on its side above the staff.\nThe lower added note may or may not be chromatically raised (turn into a sharp)\nAn \"inverted turn\" (the note below the one indicated, the note itself, the note above it, and the note itself again) is usually indicated by putting a short vertical line through the normal turn sign, though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down.\nAppoggiatura.\nAn Appoggiatura literally means a \u201cleaning note\u201d. The word comes from the Italian word \"appoggiare\", \"to lean upon\". It is a note which wants to fall down to the next one which is part of the harmony. Composers often wrote an appoggiatura in small print. This usually means it must be played by taking half the time value of the next note (for example: an appoggiatura in front of a quaver (eighth note) turns both notes into two semiquavers (sixteenth notes). During the 18th century composers stopped writing them in small print and just wrote them as normal notes.\nAcciaccatura.\nAn acciaccatura is a note which is played as fast as possible. It means a \u201ccrushed note\u201d (in Italian \"acciaccare\" means \"to crush\"). It is normally written in small print but with a slash through it to show that it is not an appoggiatura. Most performers play acciaccaturas exactly on the beat, but sometimes it is better to play it just before the beat so that the main note is exactly on time on the beat."}

Retrograde motion is motion in the opposite direction. In the case of celestial bodies such as the retrograde Carme group of moons, such motion may be real, defined by the natural rotation or orbit of the body. \nEvery so often a planet seems to change direction and go the other way for a short period of time (in relation to the fixed stars), making a \"retrograde loop\" or squiggle in its track before carrying on as normal. This apparent retrograde motion, however, is seen because the Earth is moving. It is only seen when outer planets are near opposition. \nA common analogy for the principle of apparent retrograde motion is that of turning on a circle. If two cars are travelling at the same constant speed from the same point on concentric circles \"next to each other\" such that one car is on the \"outside\" and the other on the \"inside\", then the car on the inside will complete its circle before the car on the outside, because it has a shorter distance to travel. Thus, it will seem to the driver of the car on the inside, that, although the speed of the cars is the same, the car on the outside is slower. The outside car will appear to \"fall behind\" the inside car. The same concept is the basis of retrograde motion. "}

He is the former CEO of Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z co-owns The 40/40 Club and the Brooklyn Nets NBA team. He is one of the most financially successful hip-hop artists and businessmen in America. Jay-Z has several nicknames, \"Jigga\", \"Hova\", \"Young Hov\", and \"The Greatest Rapper Alive\".\nIn June 2019, it was reported that Jay-Z had become the first billionaire rapper.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nJay-Z had a really rough adolescence. At the age of 11 his father left the family, so he was raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Like he said in a lot of his autobiographical songs, Jay-Z was involved with a lot of drug deals and gun violence. Jay-Z went to Eli Whitney High School, in Brooklyn, where he met the well-known The Notorious B.I.G.\nThe Beginning.\nJay-Z started to rap at a very young age. He thought it was a way to escape from violence, drugs and poverty. At the age of 20, Shawn met Jaz-O, who was an old performer. He was a sort of mentor for Jay-Z. He recorded a song with him called \u201cThe Originator\u201d. This song gave them the opportunity to go on the MTV raps show and this was the first step to glory for him. After this show he needed to find a stage name. He chose Jay Z, to thank his mentor Jaz-O, but also at his high school he used to be called \u201cJazzy\u201d. Jay-Z had a good start, but he wasn\u2019t mainstream enough to be a famous star of hip-hop, so he decided to create his own label record with two of his friends called the Roc-A-Fella Records. His career took a step higher, in 1998, when he won his first Grammy with his song Hard-Knock-Life. From 1998 to 2003, Jay-Z produced a lot of good songs and albums, but his most famous album was \"The Blueprint\". It was claimed by critics to be one of the albums of the decade. He was now considered as one of the biggest in the game.\nThe extension of the Empire.\nIn 2003, Jay-Z stopped rapping, because he found that there were not enough good rappers to compete with him. He said that the game was too easy for him. He decided to concentrate more on his producer career than his rap career. He became the president of Def Jam Recordings. He signed a lot of great artists such as Rihanna, Ne-Yo and Kanye West. He also became a businessman by creating his own clothing company, Rocawear, and owning a part of the Brooklyn Nets, an NBA basketball team.\nPresent.\nAfter a step back in his career, he made a decision in 2006 to come back into the game. He created the albums \"Kingdom Came\" and the year after \"American Gangster\". In 2009, he released Blue print 3, but in 2011 he teamed up with Kanye West to do an LP called \"Watch the Throne\". This album went triple hit, made the top rap charts for August and also nominated for the Grammy for the best rap Album. Now, he is known to be one of the best rappers of all time. In April 2011 Jay-Z started a website called \"Life+ Times\". He also took part in Barack Obama\u2019s last elections. Jay-Z's twelfth album, \"Magna Carta Holy Grail\", was released in July 2013. The album topped the chart to number one. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. The first single on the album, \"Holy Grail\", features Justin Timberlake singing in it. It reached number four on the US \"Billboard\" 100. In South Korea it reached number one. Jay-Z's wife Beyonc\u00e9 sings on \"Part II (On the Run)\". In December 2013 Jay-Z was nominated for nine Grammy Awards. This was more than anyone else that year. He rapped on his wife Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles' fifth album \"Beyonc\u00e9\".\nTogether with Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z has three children: daughter Blue Ivy (born 2012) and twins Rumi and Sir Carter, who were born in June 2017.\nAlbums.\nJAY-Z has released the following albums during his career:"}

Hanno the Carthaginian went to the river in about 450 BC when he was going from Carthage to Mount Cameroon in the Gulf of Guinea. Carthage was destroyed in 146 BC, but before that time there was probably trade from here to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe Semef\u00e9 River and Bafing River meet in Bafoulab\u00e9 and this forms the Senegal River. The Semef\u00e9 and Bafing rivers' sources are in Guinea. The Bafing River flows through Mali and the Semef\u00e9 is the Mali-Senegal border.\nNear the river's mouth, the Senegal goes through Biffeche and there is an island in the river. The city of Saint-Louis is on this island. The river then turns south. There is a thin line of sand and this separates the river from the Atlantic Ocean. The line of sand is called the Langue de Barbarie. After this, the river enters the Atlantic Ocean. The river has two large dams: the Manantali Dam in Mali, and the Maka-Diama Dam on the Mauritania-Senegal border, near the sea. The Manantali Dam makes a reservoir. The Maka-Diama Dam stops salt water going deep into the countryside.\nThe Senegal River takes its water from 483,181 km\u00b2 of land. About 8 000 000 km\u00b3 of water goes along the river every year. The Faleme River, Karakoro River, and Gorgol River join the Senegal River.\nIn 1972, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal made the Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (OMVS). This organisation manages the land around the river. Guinea joined this organisation in 2005."}

He was the eleventh and youngest son of the great composer Johann Sebastian Bach. He is often called 'the London Bach' or 'the English Bach', because he spent many years living in London. He became internationally famous, both as a composer and as a performer. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart liked his music, and learned a lot about how to write good concertos by looking at the concertos of J. C. Bach.\nLife.\nChildhood.\nJohann Christian Bach\u2019s parents were Johann Sebastian Bach and Anna Magdalena Bach. He was born in Leipzig, Germany. His famous father was one of the last composers of the Baroque period. His father was already 50 when J. C. Bach was born, so it is not surprising that by the time Johann Christian had grown up the style of music had changed a lot since Johann Sebastian had been writing his great works. Johann Christian belonged to the Classical period. He was 15 when his father died. He moved to Berlin and his half-brother Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, who was already a famous composer, gave him more music lessons.\nItaly.\nJohann Christian lived in Italy for many years from 1756, first studying counterpoint with Padre Martini in Bologna and later with Giovanni Battista Sammartini. He became an organist at the cathedral in Milan in 1760. However, he soon started to become successful as an opera composer and he left his cathedral job so that he could work in the theatre and travel more in Italy.\nJohann Christian had been brought up in the Lutheran church, but in Italy he became a Catholic. He married the Italian soprano Cecilia Grassi. She was about eight years older than Johann Christian and, perhaps because of this, they never had children.\nLondon years.\nIn 1762 he moved to London. He was very successful there, and earned plenty of money to live comfortably. He knew the royal family and many important aristocratic people as well as famous people such as the painter Gainsborough and the musician and writer Charles Burney. King George III and Queen Charlotte went to hear his first London opera \"Orione\" in 1763. He gave the Queen music lessons.\nHe lived at a time when the piano was becoming a popular instrument and the harpsichord was becoming old-fashioned. J. C. Bach wrote a lot of music for the piano and gave the very first concert of piano music in London in 1768. He wrote 6 keyboard concertos and dedicated them to the Queen. The last movement of Concerto no 6 was a set of variations on \"God Save the King\". This became a very popular piece of music at the time. He wrote many songs that became popular in his time. They were often performed in Vauxhall Gardens, a park where many people went to be entertained.\nHe gave many concerts together with Carl Friedrich Abel, a well-known player of the viola da gamba. Abel and Bach may have known one another as children because both their fathers had worked together in C\u00f6then in Germany. In April 1764 J. C. Bach met the 8-year-old Mozart who visited London with his father Leopold. They played duets on the harpsichord together.\nHe composed cantatas, chamber music, keyboard and orchestral works, operas, symphonies and songs. He had many works published in London and Paris.\nDuring his last years he lost a lot of money. The Bach-Abel concert series lost money, and one of Bach\u2019s servants stole \u00a31000 from him which was a very large sum on those days. His health started to become bad and, when he died, he left his wife with a lot of debt. Queen Charlotte helped to pay a lot of the debt, and his widow went back to Italy.\nHe was buried in St Pancras churchyard, London."}

They were not dinosaurs or reptiles. They are an informal group, meaning all synapsids except the therapsids and their descendants.\nThese tetrapods appeared during the Pennsylvanian and went extinct at the end of the Permian period. They were the dominant land animals for some 40 million years, and were almost wiped out by the P/Tr extinction event. A few survived until the lower Triassic to form the therapsids, a group which led to the mammals. Because the term does not include their descendants, it is not used much now.\nCharacteristics.\nPelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America, although some small, late-surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa.\nAt least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail, consisting of elongated vertebral spines: the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids. In life, this would have been covered by skin, and possibly functioned as a thermoregulatory device and/or a mating display. \nUnlike lepidosaurian reptiles, pelycosaurs lacked epidermal scales. Fossil evidence from some ophiacodonts shows that parts of the skin was naked, but that the belly was covered in dermal scutes. These scutes looked like the scutes present in reptile groups, but they are of a different type of structure. \nIn 1940 the group was reviewed in detail and every species known at the time described (and many illustrated) in an important monograph.\nWell-known pelycosaurs include the genera \"Dimetrodon\", \"Sphenacodon\", \"Edaphosaurus\", and \"Ophiacodon\"."}

The successful gorgonopsians died out, and the remaining groups were much reduced. \nThe dicynodonts, now represented by a single family of large stocky herbivores, the Kannemeyeridae, and the medium-sized cynodonts (including both carnivorous and herbivorous forms), flourished worldwide, throughout the early to middle Triassic. They died out across much of Pangea before the end of the Upper Triassic, although they continued for some time longer in the wet equatorial band and the south.\nAt least three groups of eucynodonts survived. They appeared in the Upper Triassic. The extremely mammal-like family, the Tritylodonts, survived into the Lower Cretaceous.

The word comes from the Italian for \"to touch\", also meaning \"to play a musical instrument\". These pieces were often quite difficult, with a lot of fast notes which showed off how well the person could play.\nThe first toccatas were written in northern Italy by composers such as Claudio Monteverdi and Giovanni Gabrieli. They are pieces for the keyboard (harpsichord or organ) with lots of running scales in the right hand and accompanying chords in the left hand. \nToccatas became popular in Germany with composers such as Hans Leo Hassler who had studied in Venice with Gabrieli. Many German Baroque organ composers wrote toccatas: Sweelinck (who was Dutch), Pachelbel, Buxtehude and Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach wrote a \"Toccata and Fugue in D minor\", which is one of the most famous pieces of Baroque organ music, and perhaps the most famous toccata ever written.\nAfter the Baroque period composers did not often write toccatas. The toccata became popular again in the late 19th century with the French organ composers such as Charles-Marie Widor whose Toccata from his \"Symphony No. 5\" is very popular today, especially at weddings. It has lots of quick notes in the right hand (and occasionally in the left) and a big tune in the pedals. Another famous organ toccata is by Louis Vierne. It is the last movement of his \"Symphony No. 1\" (at this time French composers wrote organ works called \"symphonies\").\nIn the 20th century several composers wrote toccatas for piano including Prokofiev, Khachaturian, Ravel (part of \"Le Tombeau de Couperin\") and Claude Debussy (part of \"Suite: Pour le Piano\").

It was one of the first modern fighters of the time. It had an all-metal construction, a closed cockpit, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine.\nThere were many variations designed for special purposes. Overall, the Me 109 was the most produced fighter aircraft in history, with a total of 33,984 airframes produced from 1936 up to April 1945.\nThe design of the plane caused some problems on the ground, and with take-off and landing. At least 10% of all Bf 109s were lost in takeoff and landing accidents, 1,500 of which occurred between 1939 and 1941. A new fixed tailwheel helped correct the problem.\nBf 109 was used by Luftwaffe together with FW 190.

It may also be used to describe a physical process in which any solvent moves across a selectively permeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations. Osmosis can be made to do work. Osmotic pressure is defined as the external pressure required to be applied so that there is no net movement of solvent across the membrane. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity.\nOsmosis is a vital process in biological systems, as biological membranes are semipermeable. In general, these membranes are impermeable to large and polar molecules, such as ions, proteins, and polysaccharides, while being permeable to non-polar or hydrophobic molecules like lipids as well as to small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and nitric oxide. Permeability depends on solubility, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute size. Water molecules travel through the plasma membrane, tonoplast membrane (vacuole) or protoplast by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer via aquaporins (small transmembrane proteins similar to those responsible for facilitated diffusion and ion channels). Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells. The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis across the cell membrane between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment.\nHypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic.\nSolutions may have more or less solute per unit of solvent. The one with less is called \"Hypotonic.\" When the two solutions have equal concentration, they are \"isotonic.\" The one with more is \"Hypertonic\". When the hypotonic solution is outside the cell,and hypertonic solution inside, the cell becomes swollen and distorted.\nCell membranes.\nThe plasma membrane of a cell is semi-permeable, which means it allowed the entry of certain molecules in or out, it lets small molecules pass through, but blocks larger molecules. The membrane also has ports or gateways which get certain macromolecules through. This is active transport, which uses energy and is selective. It is outermost covering of the animal cell. It is made up of proteins and lipids. Example:- Exchange of gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide."}

The company was first formed in December 1939 as a design office called Mikoyan-Gurevich or MiG, this was because its designers were Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich. Mikoyan will join other Russian airplane companies in a new company called United Aircraft Corporation.\nHistory.\nIn 1939 Russia was part of the Soviet Union and was communist. In the Soviet communist system there were two types of airplane companies, companies that designed aircraft known as design offices or OKB, and companies that made airplanes called zavods. Artom Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich had been designers in another design office helping a designer called Nikolai Polikarpov. One airplane design that Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich worked on at Polikarpov was called the I-200. When Nikolai Polikarpov lost the trust of the Soviet leader Stalin, Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were given the I-200 design to finish. This airplane was given a new name and was called the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-1. As it was being made, ways to make the MiG-1 into a better airplane were found and airplanes with these changes became known as the MiG-3 and later the MiG-7. However even with changes the MiG fighter airplanes were not as good as the fighter airplanes designed by the design offices of Lavochkin or Yakovlev.\nAfter World War II Mikoyan-Gurevich designed jet aircraft. In the Soviet system the airplane designs of the design offices would compete to see which was the best. When the best design had been found the design would be built by the airplane manufacturing company. Even though Mikoyan-Gurevich airplanes in World War II had not been as good as airplanes by Lavochkin or Yakovlev. Mikoyan-Gurevich jet aircraft won more of the competitions to be sent to the zavods and in the time of the Cold War Mikoyan-Gurevich, together with another design office called Sukhoi, became one of the two most important design offices of fighter planes in the Soviet Union.\nIn the Soviet system decisions were made to protect the government from its own soldiers. In many countries there is only one airforce, the Soviet Union had five airforces. Two of these airforces were the main users of Soviet fighter airplanes. One airforce was called \"PVO Strany\", this airforce was used to defend the cities and land of the Soviet Union. One airforce was called \"Frontal Aviation\", this airforce was used to defend the Soviet Union's ground soldiers against enemy fighter airplanes, and to attack enemy ground forces. Mikoyan-Gurevich became the main designer of aircraft for \"Frontal Aviation\".\nAircraft made.\nMikoyan has designed the following airplanes:"}

It is made of one or more movie projectors, which are linked to a movie camera. It allows filmmakers to re-photograph one or more strips of movie. The optical printer is used for making special effects for motion pictures or for copying and restoring old movie material.\nCommon optical effects include fade outs and fade ins, dissolves, slow motion, fast motion, and matte work. More complicated work needs dozens of elements, all combined into a single scene. Ideally, the audience in a theater should not be able to notice any optical printers work, but this is not always the case. For economical reasons, especially in the 1950s, and later in TV series produced on movie, printer work was limited to only the actual parts of a scene needing the effect, so there is a clear change in the image quality when the transition occurs.\nThe first, simple optical printers were constructed in the early 1920s. Linwood G. Dunn expanded the concept in the 1930s. The development continued well into the 1980s, when the printers were controlled with minicomputers.\nSice the late 1980s, digital compositing began to replace optical effects. Since the mid nineties the conversion to digital effects has been almost total. Optical printing today is used most widely by artists working exclusively with movie. As a technique, it proves particularly useful for making copies of hand painted or physically manipulated movie."}

Often these are called Wireless LAN, \"WLAN\", or Wi-Fi. Such a protocol allows computers that have the needed radio parts to communicate with each other, without a cable. There are many types of Wi-Fi standards, known as 802.11 a, b, g, n, and recently ac &amp; ad. These specifications are different in terms of speed and how far away you can use them.\nLater standards.\nThe first Wi-Fi standard was made in 1997. It is called IEEE 802.11. It allows communication with 1-2 MBit per second. Today it is outdated, and rare. Later standards add a letter to the name. They are labelled IEEE 802.11a to IEEE 802.11g. There are plans for ones labeled h, i, j, n, p and s. They are all compatible with each other.\nNewer standards have a Bit rate of 54 MBit/s. About 40-50% of this is usable in real-life situations. As of 2007, the standards most widely used are IEEE 802.11g, and IEEE 802.11b.\nFrequency bands.\nData communication is either done in the 2.4 GHz band or in the 5 GHz band. The 2.4 GHz band is a general use band. Microwave ovens and Bluetooth are among the things that emit radio waves in this band. The 2.4 GHz band has the problem that there are only very few channels that can be used at the same time, without the signals interfering. There are three usable channels there. When more than three networks operate in the same place, signals still get to the user correctly, but interference slows them. \nThe 5 GHz band can solve some of these problems, but it introduces others. That band has 19 usable channels. Overall the band is less used. However there are more regulations. Most devices need to be able to choose their channel to minimize interference. Some channels require that those participating can do Transmitter Power Control. This means they adapt the strength of the signal to what is actually needed. This helps reduce the amount of interference between different networks."}

It was developed in the 1990s, to reduce the number of cables. Devices such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers, digital cameras and video game consoles can connect to each other, and exchange information. This is done using radio waves. It can be done securely. Bluetooth is usually only used for relatively short distances, like a few metres. Some signals can be up to 100 metres.\nThere are different standards. Data rates vary. Currently, they are at 1-3 MBit per second. Typical Bluetooth applications are to connect a headset to a mobile phone, or to connect a computer mouse, keyboard or printer.\nBluetooth devices use the ISM Band around 2.4 GHz. This can be used worldwide, without the need to pay license fees, but many other devices, like DECT telephones (wireless phones), smart tags with RFID, baby phones use it too. Bluetooth uses the same bands as some WLANs, but the modulation technique is different. Bluetooth uses Frequency-hopping spread spectrum.\nComparing Bluetooth to Wireless LAN.\nThere are many situations today where either Bluetooth or Wireless LANs can be used. Examples include setting up networks, printing or transferring files and data from a PDA to a computer. Both are versions of unlicensed wireless technology. WLANs can span bigger distances and offer higher throughput. Bluetooth does not require expensive hardware. It also needs less power to operate.\nBoth use the same radio frequency range, but their modulation techniques are different. Both have been developed to replace cabling. Bluetooth wanted to get rid of the peripheral equipment cables, WLANs wanted to get rid of the cables needed to set up a LAN.\nBluetooth devices.\nBluetooth exists in many products, such as telephones, the Wii or PlayStation 3. It has recently been built into some electronic watches, modems and headsets. The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations. Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones (i.e. with a Bluetooth headset) or byte data with hand-held computers (transferring files).\nBluetooth uses protocols that make it easy to discover devices that are nearby, and to set up a connection between these devices. Bluetooth devices can advertise all the services they offer. Using services becomes easier; a lot of the setup related to security, networking or permissions is automatic.\nWireless LAN.\nWLANs are more like traditional LANs. More configuration is needed to set up the network, and to make resources accessible by other devices in the network. WLAN devices also consume more power than Bluetooth ones. \nSometimes WLANs are called wireless Ethernet. WLAN needs more resources to be set up, but it also offers faster transfer speeds. The security is also better than that offered by Bluetooth."}

Its name is from 'morph' (meaning form), and 'meta' (meaning change).\nThe original rock gets heated (temperatures greater than 150 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C) and pressured (1500 bars). This causes profound physical and/or chemical change. The original rock may be sedimentary rock, igneous rock or another older metamorphic rock.\nThere is always more pressure and higher temperature under the Earth's surface. In the root of a mountain chain or a volcano these forces will be enough to change shape of the strata and the minerals it is made of. Sedimentary rock which has been near such forces often looks as if a giant had twisted it and heated it over a fire. Examples of metamorphic rock:\nThe recrystallisation of minerals after heating generally causes the destruction of any fossils the rocks might have contained. These rocks are formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks are subjected to extreme heat and pressure as result they undergo a complete change in their form and characteristics. Such form rocks are called metamorphic rocks.\nTypes of metamorphism.\nRegional metamorphism.\nRegional metamorphism, or dynamic metamorphism, occurs in great masses of rock. Rocks can be metamorphosed just by being at great depths below the Earth's surface. There they get high temperatures and the great weight of the rock layers above.\nMuch of the lower continental crust is metamorphic, except for recent igneous intrusions. Horizontal tectonic movements such as the collision of continents create orogenic belts. High temperature, pressures and deformation occurs along these belts. If the metamorphosed rocks are later uplifted and exposed by erosion, they are seen as long belts or other large areas at the surface.\nContact metamorphism.\nContact metamorphism occurs when magma is injected into the surrounding solid rock (country rock). The changes that occur are greatest where the magma comes into contact with the rock. The temperatures were highest there and decreased with distance from it.\nMetamorphic minerals.\nMetamorphic minerals are those that form only at the high temperatures and pressures of metamorphism. These minerals, known as index minerals, include sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, andalusite, and some garnet.\nOther minerals, such as olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, feldspars, and quartz may be found in metamorphic rocks. They are not necessarily the result of the process of metamorphism. These minerals formed during the crystallization of igneous rocks. They are stable at high temperatures and pressures and may remain chemically unchanged during the metamorphic process. "}

It occurs when there are lines of weakness such as faults, joints, or bedding planes in the crust. Then magma enters these lines of weakness. By contrast, an extrusion is magma which cools into rock above the surface of the crust. Both intrusive and extrusive rocks are classed as igneous rocks.\nThe process of forming intrusive rocks may take millions of years. As the rock slowly cools into a solid, the different parts of the magma crystallize into minerals. The crystals are usually larger than in extrusive rocks. Many mountain ranges, such as the Sierra Nevada in California, are formed mostly by intrusive rock. Often they are huge granite (or related rock) formations.\nIntrusions vary widely, from mountain range sized batholiths to thin vein-like fracture fillings. When exposed by erosion, these cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas of Earth's surface. Large bodies of magma that solidify underground before they reach the surface of the crust are called plutons.\nIntrusive structures may go between bedding planes of earlier 'country' rock. A sill is an intrusion which makes a table along bedding planes. A dyke is an intrusion which moves up, crossing older strata."}

If absorbed, the pressure is the energy flux density divided by the speed of light. If the radiation is totally reflected, the radiation pressure is doubled. This happens because the waves that make up electromagnetic radiation carry momentum with them and pass that momentum on when they reach a surface.\nA Crookes radiometer appears to demonstrate the pressure of light, but instead it demonstrate the energy that light brings to a surface. The black side of each paddle absorbs most of the light's energy an causes the air near that surface to have a higher pressure. So, while a Crookes radiometer turns because of pressure, it is air pressure caused by the heat energy that light brings to the device. \nSolar radiation at Earth.\nThe solar radiation at Earth's distance from the Sun has an energy flux density of 1370 W/m2, and more than half of this energy reaches surface. A calculation shows that this value of the flux would cause on an absorbing surface to experience 4.6 \u00b5Pa of radiation pressure. A convenient way to compare the Sun's energy flux and radiation pressure is to imagine the pressure and energy deposited on one square meter:\nTo understand how small a micro-newton is, convert calculate how much mass you need on Earth to get that force using formula_3:\nThe difference between the energy flux and the pressure is like the difference between the heat coming through a large window and the weight of a very small mosquito."}

{"id": "76166", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76166", "title": "Pistol", "text": "A pistol is a handgun. The word may be used broadly to mean any handgun, or narrowly to mean only a magazine pistol, as distinct from a revolver. \nIn a magazine pistol, the cartridges are in a magazine, which is a metal or plastic box. The magazine is usually inside the handle of the pistol. When the pistol is fired, the empty cartridge pops out, and the next one comes up into position. The magazine is spring-loaded so it pushes the next bullet into place as the empty cartridge is ejected. For that reason pistols are sometimes called \"semi-automatic\". When the magazine runs out of cartridges, it can be reloaded by inserting more cartridges. \nThe term has long been variously used. For example, in the American Old West revolvers were used but were then (and even today by some) called pistols. The word \"pistol\" entered English before 1600, from the French. At that time it usually meant a single-shot handgun.\nGun safety.\nOne of the most important rules of gun safety is to keep guns out of the hands of children. Guns should be locked up and kept away from children and others who do not appreciate how deadly they are. Pistols like all guns should always be handled carefully. Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. A shooter should keep their fingers away from the trigger until the moment they intend to shoot. Always respect guns as a tool that can cause harm if used incorrectly. Always assume a gun is loaded until you are certain it is not.\nA bullet is not the only part of a gun that can cause injury. Hearing protection will protect the eardrums of the shooter and those nearby. These can be inexpensive foam earplugs or more costly hearing protectors that have a Noise Reduction Rating or NRR. The higher the NRR number the better. Eye protection should be worn at all times while shooting or observing other shooters. Their impact-resistant lenses protect against bullet fragments, stray bits of gunpowder, and other debris.\nPros and cons of pistols.\nThe advantage of pistols over revolvers lies in the somewhat faster reloading of magazines that carry more bullets that a revolver's five or six rounds. This is why most police and military organizations use pistols. Also, pistols are often thinner and can be worn concealed better than revolvers. \nPistols have a few disadvantages when compared to revolvers. They are more complicated and have more moving parts. A pistol may use heavier springs that younger and elderly shooters may find difficult to use.\nModern pistols usually only fire one shot every time you pull the trigger. Some special pistols, called machine pistols, can fire more than one shot at a time. Some famous pistols are the Colt M1911 and the Beretta 92. \nPistols were not often used in the western United States during the 1800s. They used revolvers. The first successful pistol being used then was the Borchardt C-93. It was designed in 1893, and became available in 1894."}

A submachine gun is smaller than a machine gun and can easily be carried by one person. They are often used where people need to defend themselves in small areas, or people need to fire many bullets quickly. The first submachine guns were invented in the early 1900s. They are often used by the police and counter-terrorism units .\nHistory.\nIn the early 20th century, experiments were made by converting pistols from semi to fully automatic firearms. Stocked (with handle) automatic weapons firing pistol rounds were developed around the same time during World War I, by Italy, Germany, and the United States. The first dedicated designs were developed in the latter stages of World War I both as improvements on earlier stocked pistols, and to offer an advantage in trench warfare.\nThey were popularized in the 1920s and '30s as weapon of choice of American gangsters and police, in the form of the famous Thompson submachine gun, commonly referred to as the \"Tommy Gun\". Submachine guns rose to prominence as a frontline close-quarters combat weapon and commando firearm during World War II. They are now widely used by police SWAT, military commando, paramilitary, and counter-terror team members for a variety of situations. \nSubmachine guns are highly effective in close quarters; their lower-powered pistol cartridges make them generally more controllable in fully-automatic fire compared to assault rifles, while their small size and light weight grant maneuverability. However, pistol bullets often are stopped by body armor or cover, and are short-ranged compared to intermediate and rifle cartridges.\nWorld War II developments.\nWorld War II developments were many and interesting. In Germany the development of machine carbines (\"Maschinenkarabiner\") was notable. From 1939 onwards the German Army analyzed combat conditions and developed new tactics and equipment requirements. The existing 7.92x57mm rifle cartridge was more powerful and long ranged than needed. Most combat took place at ranges less than 400 m (440 yards). A less powerful round (bullet) could be used. This meant a soldier could carry more ammunition, the weapon could be shorter, lighter and with less recoil. The gun could be an automatic.\nAchieving this took time. Work in 1941 and 1942 led at last to a reliable weapon, the StG 44 (Sturmgewehr 44) \"assault rifle 44\". This was then produced in large numbers (over 600,000). It came too late to effect the Second World War, but was later adapted as the Soviet AK 47."}

He wrote a book of stories called \"At Dusk\" that won the Pushkin Prize, an award for good writing.\nIn 1887, Chekhov wrote a play called \"Ivanov\". Chekhov did not like the play, but critics loved it.\nIn 1890, Chekhov went to Sakhalin Island, a penal colony (prison). He talked to many prisoners and found out that they were treated very badly. The prisoners were often beaten. There were also children there. He was angry, and wrote about it in a book called \"The Island Of Sakhalin\" and in a short story called \"The Murder\".\nIn 1892, he bought a house and some land near Moscow called Melikhovo. While he was there, he helped the people who lived nearby. He brought them food and clothing, and medicine when they were sick. Since he was trained as a doctor, he knew how to take care of them.\nWhile at Melikhovo, he started to write a play called \"The Seagull\". When it was first performed, it went very badly, and the audience did not like it. Later, it was performed at another theater, the Moscow Art Theater, where the performances went better. Soon after this, he had another play performed, called \"Uncle Vanya\". He later wrote two more great plays: \"Three Sisters\" and \"The Cherry Orchard\". All four plays are still often performed today.\nMarriage, sickness, and death.\nIn 1897, he became sick. Doctors told him that he had tuberculosis, a lung disease, and that he should change his life to be healthier. He moved to Yalta and bought a house there. In 1901 he married a woman named Olga Knipper. At Yalta, he wrote some of his most famous stories, including a story called \"The Lady With The Dog\".\nBy 1904, Chekhov was very sick. He died on the 15th of July in Germany. Thousands of people were very sad when he died. He was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery.\nInfluence.\nChekhov influenced many important writers, including George Bernard Shaw, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. His short stories are still read by many people around the world."}

In cathedrals in Britain and in some of the old university chapels it is a service that is sung by a choir nearly every day of the week (there is usually one day of the week when there is no choir and everything is spoken). In cathedrals it is usually just the choir and the priests who sing, while the congregation listen. There is sometimes one hymn at the end in which the congregation can join in. Evensong in churches will have more singing for the congregation to join in.\nDevelopment and meaning of Evensong.\nThe form of Evensong used today was developed by Thomas Cranmer in the 16th century. There were two kinds of services, called \"vespers\" and \"compline\" that used to be sung every day by monks in monasteries. Cranmer took some of the words that were used in both these services and made today's form of Evening Prayer (Evensong).\nThe main idea in Evensong is the celebration of the incarnation of Christ: this is the story about Christ coming to the world in the form of a person and living among people. The words of the Magnificat and the Nunc Dimittis are always used in the service. The Magnificat is the song that Mary sang when she was told that she was going to have a baby who would be God\u2019s son. The Nunc Dimittis is the song that was sung by the priest Simeon who had been promised by God that he would live long enough to see Jesus. Both these sets of words are from the New Testament.\nMany churches now use the words from \"Common Worship\" or some other modern prayer book for their services. However, when Evensong is sung by a choir the words used are usually from the old traditional \"Book of Common Prayer\" (1662). This is because, for more than four centuries, so much great music has been composed that uses these words.\nBecause there is no communion at evensong, the service can be led by a layperson (someone who is not a \u201cqualified\u201d priest).\nParts of the Evensong service.\nAn evensong service will consist of the following:\nThe organist usually plays some organ music before and after the service. On Sundays there may be a sermon.\nMusic.\nIn churches the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis (canticles), like the psalm, are often sung to a chant. This is a tune which repeats itself for every verse or every two verses and is sung to the natural rhythm in which it would be spoken. In cathedrals, or in churches with a good choir, the two canticles are sung to special music (like an anthem) composed by some well-known composer. There is usually an organ accompaniment. \nMany composers, especially Anglican church composers, wrote settings (music) for these two canticles (which choir members often called \u201cMag and Nunc\u201d). Such composers include Edward Bairstow, Herbert Brewer, Orlando Gibbons, Herbert Howells, Henry Purcell, Charles Stanford, Herbert Sumsion, Thomas Tallis, Thomas Weelkes, Samuel Wesley and many others. Some of the composers wrote several settings. This is why different settings are often identified by the key they are in, e.g. Stanford in G, Stanford in C etc. Sometimes they can be identified by the cathedral for which they were written. Herbert Howells, for example, wrote Mag and Nunc settings for several cathedrals and chapels. These can be identified by calling them: Howells\u2019 Gloucester Service, Collegium Regale (=King\u2019s College, Cambridge) etc.\nIn a sung evensong the choir will also sing an \"introit\" which is a very short piece at the beginning of the service. They will sing a psalm to a chant, and there will also be an anthem."}

{"id": "76233", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76233", "title": "The Nutcracker", "text": "The Nutcracker is a classical ballet in two acts. It is based on E.T.A. Hoffmann's 1816 fairy tale \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\". It tells the story of a little girl who goes to the Land of Sweets on Christmas Eve. Ivan Vsevolozhsky and Marius Petipa adapted Hoffmann's story for the ballet. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov designed the dances. \"The Nutcracker\" was first performed at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 18 December 1892 to a modest success and rarely seen the next years.\nIn 1940, Walt Disney used some of the \"Nutcracker\" music in his animated movie \"Fantasia\", which led to an interest in the ballet. Interest grew when George Balanchine's \"The Nutcracker\" was televised in the late 1950s. The ballet has been performed in many different places since then. Before the first performance, Tchaikovsky took some numbers from the ballet to form the \"Nutcracker Suite\". This work was a great success on the concert stage, and is still played today.\nOrigin.\nThe origin of \"The Nutcracker\" has its roots in the great success of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" ballet. This ballet was staged at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1890. It was the work of the director of the Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg, Ivan Vsevolozhsky; the composer, Tchaikovsky; and the choreographer, Marius Petipa. Vsevolozsky thought another ballet based on a children's story would be just as successful as \"The Sleeping Beauty\".\nHe picked Hoffmann's 1816 fairy tale \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" as the subject for the new ballet. This story was loved by Russians. He wrote an adaptation of Hoffmann's story based on the Alexandre Dumas translation. He dropped much of the original. Petipa adapted Vsevolozsky's story to the requirements of ballet. Vsevolozsky then pressured Tchaikovsky into writing the music for the ballet. Tchaikovsky did not like the adaptation of Hoffmann's story, but he agreed to write the music.\nPetipa designed the dances. He gave Tchaikovsky special directions about how the music was to be written. For example, he wanted a great \"crescendo\" of 48 bars as the Christmas tree rose higher and higher in Act 1. He wrote that the music for the \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" should sound like drops of water splashing in a fountain.\nIn March 1892 the music was almost complete. Tchaikovsky took the \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\", the \"Waltz of the Flowers\", and other numbers from the ballet to form the 20-minute \"Nutcracker Suite\". It was first played for the Russian Musical Society. The organization's members loved it. \"Nutcracker Suite\" is still played today.\nTchaikovsky completed the music for the ballet in April 1892. Rehearsals started in September 1892. Petipa fell ill and his assistant Lev Ivanov completed the dances. The ballet was first performed on 18 December 1892 at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. Tchaikovsky's one-act opera \"Iolanta\" was played before the curtain rose on \"The Nutcracker\". The run ended in 1893 after eleven performances.\nLater.\nIn 1919, choreographer Alexander Gorsky staged a production. He cut out the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier, and gave their dances to Clara and the Nutcracker Prince. They were now played by adults instead of children. A shortened version of the ballet was first performed outside Russia in Budapest's Royal Opera House in 1927.\nIn 1934, Vasili Vainonen, choreographer of the Kirov Ballet, staged a version of the work which was also influenced by the criticisms of the original production. He also cast adult dancers in the roles of Clara and the Prince, as Gorsky had. The Vainonen version influenced several later productions. Knowledge of the choreography spread because many dancers went to the west after the Russian Revolution.\nThe first complete performance outside Russia took place in England in 1934. It was staged by Nicholas Sergeyev at the Vic-Wells Ballet. It used a version of Petipa's original choreography. Annual performances of the ballet have been staged there since 1952.\nPlot.\nThe ballet takes place in Germany in the early 19th century. The curtain rises on a Christmas Eve party in the Silberhaus home. Guests arrive. The children get their presents, then dance about the room.\nThe door opens. A strange little man named Drosselmeyer comes into the room. He is a toy-maker. He is also Clara Silberhaus's godfather. He has four dancing dolls for the children and a special surprise for Clara. It is a nutcracker. She loves it, but her brother Fritz accidentally breaks it. She places the Nutcracker in her doll bed to get well.\nThe party ends and everyone leaves. Clara and her family go to bed. Clara creeps back to the room. She needs to be certain her Nutcracker is resting quietly. All of a sudden, mice start running about the room. The dolls, the tin soldiers, and all the other playthings come to life to fight the mice.\nThe Christmas tree rises higher and higher. The Nutcracker jumps out of the doll bed to fight the Mouse King. When the Nutcracker is in danger, Clara saves his life by throwing her slipper at the Mouse King. The Mouse King runs out of the room with all the other mice.\nThe Nutcracker becomes a human prince. Clara and the Nutcracker Prince set off through the snowy woods for the magical Land of Sweets. The beautiful Sugar Plum Fairy rules this land. She welcomes the two children then orders her subjects to dance for them. Dances about Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate are presented. Many other dances are presented. The ballet ends with everyone dancing a waltz.\nStructure.\nAct I: Tableau 1\n\"\"'Act I: Tableau 2\nAct II: Tableau 3\nReception.\nCriticism of the ballet was mixed. A portion thought of it to be a noble composition, with exemplary themes and emotion, however many thought otherwise. Russian balletomanes liked expert adult dancers and the large cast of children was critically attacked. One person complained that the ballet was \"produced with children for children.\" Even the adult dancers came under fire. One person, for example, thought the dancer playing the doll in Act 1 was \"nice\" while another person thought she was \"insipid\".\nOne critic complained that the ballet was in bad taste because characters in Act 2 looked like food from a pastry shop. Another complained that Ivanov's \"Waltz of the Snowflakes\" was taken from ballets by Petipa. Tchaikovsky however thought that the staging was very beautiful, so much so that his eyes grew tired looking at it.\nSome people were surprised that Tchaikovsky had anything to do with the ballet. They thought \"The Nutcracker\" was foolish. They were embarrassed that the great composer had had a hand in it. On the first night however, Czar Alexander III called Tchaikovsky before him in the royal box to congratulate him on the music.\nThe newspapers were divided on the ballet's value. The \"St. Petersburg Gazette\" wrote \"this ballet is the most tedious thing ever seen ... a long way from what ballet music should be.\" The \"St. Petersburg News-sheet\" wrote, \"It is hard to say which number is the greatest, for everything from start to finish is beautiful.\" \"The New Age\" wrote that Tchaikovsky's orchestral writing was the work of genius. A ballet lover thought \"The Nutcracker\" was the greatest of the three ballets Tchaikovsky had written.\nPost-Premier.\nThe ballet's initial run ended in January 1893. When the Russian Revolution broke out in 1917, many ballet dancers were put out of work. They went to Europe. They talked to their new friends in Europe about \"The Nutcracker\". Some selections were performed here and there. In 1940 Walt Disney used some of the music in his movie \"Fantasia\". In 1944 the Nutcracker was staged at the San Francisco Ballet by William Christensen, the 'very first full-length' on Christmas Eve. W.Christensen was called the grandfather of American Ballet, born (1902-2001) in Brigham City, Utah. He had established the San Francisco Ballet in 1938. Later he founded the ballet department to the University of Utah in 1951, the first of its kind, and Ballet West in 1963. Mr. C's creation has an 75th Anniversary during the 2019-2020 season. In 1954 George Balanchine staged \"The Nutcracker\" in New York City. People liked it. When it was aired on television in 1957 and 1958, the ballet became more famous than ever. Balanchine's television \"Nutcracker\" had enough fun in it for people who had not seen a ballet, and enough dancing in it to please the ballet lovers who watched it. In the 1960s small ballet companies started producing \"The Nutcracker\" because it could make a lot of money and, in doing so, keep the company in business.\nModern times.\nToday, \"The Nutcracker\" has been staged and seen by many people all over the world. Jennifer Fisher points out that it is \"the most popular and most often [staged] ballet in the world.\" In North America, it is a yearly event in many places. Parents and children take part in staging the ballet and dancing in it. Trained ballerinas dance side by side with children who are only learning to dance. Parents work on costumes and sets. Local celebrities take small walk-on parts.\nThere have been many adaptations of the ballet over the years. In the United States, for example, there are hula, tap dance, reggae, wheelchair, dance-along, ice, and drag versions. In Canada, there have been hockey adaptations. Products such as Nutcracker dolls, soaps, foods, and clothing are sold in theatres before the show.\nBallet lovers question the present day dumbing-down (oversimplification) of \"The Nutcracker\" to make it accessible to the masses. The reasons the ballet was originally disliked in Russia (the many child dancers, the uneven story) seem to be the reasons the ballet has become such a great success in North America. Americans like seeing their children on stage and the story is very much like the rags-to-riches stories Americans love. Some people though complain about the stereotypes of children in Act 1 (boys are naughty, girls are nice) and also about the stereotypes of Arabians and the Chinese in Act 2.\nMusic.\nInstrumentation.\nTchaikovsky wrote \"The Nutcracker\" for an orchestra of strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. To this orchestra he added a \"celesta\" for the \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" in Act 2 and children's instrumentsdrums, trumpets, cymbals, bird calls, whistles, and a rattlefor the Christmas party in Act 1. The instruments were specially ordered and tuned to Tchaikovsky's orders. The rattle is heard in the orchestra pit when Fritz cracks nuts in Act 1, and the other instruments are heard when the boys make a lot of noise while Clara comforts the broken Nutcracker.\nTchaikovsky hoped that the children would play the instruments on the stage, but they had difficulty keeping together with the orchestra. Because of the difficulty the children had, Tchaikovsky made the decision that they could play freely. He did not ask them to keep with the written music. After the first night, Tchaikovsky sent his thanks and baskets of sweets to the children of the Imperial Ballet School.\nSugar Plum Fairy.\nThe Sugar Plum Fairy is a character in \"The Nutcracker\". The Sugar Plum Fairy only dances in Act 2 of the ballet. Clara falls asleep, and the second act could be seen as Clara's dream. Roland John Wiley however, thinks that the second act is a reality shaped by Drosselmeyer. The Sugar Plum Fairy is the ruler of the Land of Sweets. She welcomes the Nutcracker Prince and his love Clara to her land and orders the festivities. The character is danced by a \"prima ballerina\" (principal dancer), though she has little dancing to do. She is joined by a male dancer for a \"pas de deux\" near the end of the ballet. Her number in this \"pas de deux\" is called \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\".\nDance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.\nThe \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" is one of the most famous numbers in \"The Nutcracker\". It was written for the \"celesta\". This instrument was new at the time the dance was written. It looks like a small piano, but it sounds like bells. Tchaikovsky discovered the \"celesta\" in Paris in 1891 while making a journey to the United States. His publisher purchased one and promised to keep the purchase a secret. Tchaikovsky did not want Rimsky-Korsakov or Glazunov to \"get wind of it and ... use it for unusual (different, strange) effects before me.\" Petipa wanted the Sugar Plum Fairy's music to sound like drops of water splashing in a fountain. Tchaikovsky thought the \"celesta\" was the instrument to do this. The original steps for the dance are unknown. Antonietta Dell'Era was the first to dance the part of the Sugar Plum Fairy. The character has very little dancing to do so Dell'Era put a gavotte by Alphonse Czibulka into the ballet. She then had something more to do.\nHistorian Opinion.\nIn his biography about Tchaikovsky John Warrack points out that the ballet's greatest weakness is its story. It did not permit Tchaikovsky to musically develop the ballet in the manner of \"Swan Lake\" or \"The Sleeping Beauty\". What few symphonic passages exist in the ballet (mostly in Act 1) are not the best Tchaikovsky wrote. Warrack thinks that the \"essential nature\" of the ballet is found in the separate numbers. Tchaikovsky knew this when he put together the \"Nutcracker Suite\" to promote the complete ballet. Because the story was so weak and did not permit symphonic development, Tchaikovsky indulged his taste for \"prettiness\" in the separate numbers. This is what makes \"The Nutcracker\", according to Warrack, an \"entertainment of genius\".\nIn the biography \"Tchaikovsky\", writer David Brown points out that Tchaikovsky was not happy with \"The Nutcracker\" and complained to his friends about the difficulty of setting the tale to music. Brown asks why Tchaikovsky would ever let himself be persuaded to accept the story as the subject for a ballet. He points out that \"Swan Lake\" and \"The Sleeping Beauty\" were \"dramatically meaty and deeply serious\" while \"The Nutcracker\" was \"trite ... [and] pointless.\" The ballet has no true culmination he writes.

Her mother was Lady Frances Brandon and Henry Grey, who were Marquess and Marchioness of Dorset and later Duke and Duchess of Suffolk.\nLife.\nKatherine (also spelled Catherine) was born in 1540 to Lady Frances Brandon and Henry Grey. Her parents were disappointed that she was a girl. However, Frances treated Katherine better than she treated her sister, Lady Jane Grey. Little is known about Katherine's early life before 1550.\nKatherine was married at the age of twelve to Henry Herbert in May of 1553. It was the same day her elder sister, Jane, was married to Guildford Dudley. Katherine's sister Jane was queen of England for nine days before Mary became Queen. Because of this, Katherine's marriage to Herbert was annulled (or divorce).\nAppearance and personality.\nKatherine was considered even more beautiful than her sister Jane. She was a little short, but she had a delicate appearance. She had shining red-gold hair and her grandmother Mary Tudor's blue eyes. She also had white skin and no freckles, unlike her sister Jane.\nUnlike her sister Jane, Katherine was not as smart and did not like her studies as much. She preferred playing with her pet dogs and birds.\nLater life.\nKatherine said that her life at Queen Mary's court was the best time of her life. She met her future husband during these years and received money from Mary every year. Mary's sister, Elizabeth, did not like Katherine much. She distrusted her and did not wish to see her married. Katherine had other plans. \nIn December 1560, she married Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford without Elizabeth I's permission. They planned to keep it a secret for a long time. However, Katherine became pregnant quickly and by July of the next year, she could not hold her secret any longer. She first tried to get help from Bess of Hardwick, but Bess screamed at Katherine and made her go away. Then she went to see Elizabeth's great favorite, Robert Dudley. He listened to Katherine but promised nothing. The next day he told Elizabeth everything. Elizabeth was angry with this and put both Edward and Katherine in prison. She gave birth to a son in the Tower of London. The child's name was Edward. \nLater, she gave birth to another son, also in the Tower of London. This made Elizabeth even more angry since Katherine was not supposed to see Edward. The couple would not see each other again after the birth. Katherine soon got tuberculosis, and died in January 1568. She is buried in Cockfield Chapel."}

His parents were Thomas Boleyn and Elizabeth Howard.\nBiography.\nGeorge was born in 1504, probably in Blickling, although it is unsure. George Boleyn was well known for serving the King (Henry VIII ), he was most favored by him. His sister, Anne, became queen because of the help of his Uncle (The Duke of Norfolk) and his Father (Thomas Boleyn). His two sisters, Anne Boleyn (Second wife of Henry VIII), and Mary Boleyn (Mistress of the King) were his only two friends. They spent much time together. He married Jane Parker, also known as Lady Jane Rochford. He was not happy with his marriage, he was only engaged to her by their Uncle. As a Boleyn/Howard (Howard, Mothers maiden name) he had to obey. His obedience towards his family made him unhappy. He refused to sleep with his wife, so instead spent many nights with his sisters in Anne's rooms. Mary would be there, for she was Anne's lady in waiting. All three of the Boleyns were very close.\nDownfall.\nGeorge Boleyn had a very close relationship with his sister Anne. He was also close with his other sister, but Mary focused more on her family with her husband (William Stafford). George and Anne's downfall happened when Henry VIII accused them of incest. Mary Boleyn was not with them at the time of their exile. She chose to hide because of her children. If she had not hidden herself, she too would have been killed. It was likely a false charge by Henry VIII so he could get rid of Anne Boleyn. George's wife claimed that George and Anne had an affair. At her own execution, Lady Jane Rochford claimed that \"God has permitted me to suffer this shameful doom as punishment for having contributed to my husband's death. I falsely accused him of loving in an incestuous manner, his sister, Queen Anne Boleyn. For this I deserve to die.\""}

They had a brother named George Boleyn. There have been many stories and books about Mary Boleyn, so historians are not sure what is true about her.\nEarly Life.\nMary was born some time between 1500 and 1507 at Blickling Hall in Norfolk. Her parents were Sir Thomas Boleyn and Lady Elizabeth Howard. While her parents had her sister Anne educated at the court of Margaret of Austria, Mary was probably educated at home. She had a well-rounded education for a woman in the 1500s. Among Mary's other skills, she could speak French.\nIn 1514, Mary's father got her a job as maid of honor to Mary Tudor, the sister of King Henry VIII. Mary Tudor was going to be married to King Louis XII of France. Mary and the other maids traveled with Mary Tudor to France, where Mary Tudor was married. Only a few months after the wedding, however, King Louis died and Francis I became king. Mary Tudor went back to England but Mary Boleyn stayed in France.\nThere were rumours that Mary Boleyn became King Francis's mistress, but some historians think the rumours may not be true. They think the rumours may have been about trying to make the Boleyn family look bad so Henry VIII could divorce Anne Boleyn.\nMarriage and mistress.\nIn 1519, Mary went back to England to marry William Carey. Soon, she became King Henry VIII's mistress. Some historians think that King Henry was the father of Mary's two children, Catherine Carey and Henry Carey, but it is also possible that her husband William Carey was their father. Mary was Henry VIII's mistress for years, possibly until as late as 1526.\nWidowhood.\nAfter Mary's husband died, she had money problems. Her sister Anne took Mary's son Henry as her ward and paid for his education.\nIn 1526, Mary married again. She married a soldier named William Stafford without her family's permission. Anne and the rest of Mary's family were angry with her. Mary and Stafford had one child, but historians do not know what happened to him or her.\nAfter Anne and George Boleyn were executed, Mary's parents began to speak to her again. After her father and grandmother died, they left Mary half the Boleyn property. But Mary Boleyn had to fight for it in law court. Mary died in Rochford Hall in 1543."}

Its capital was the city of Dresden, and its modern successor state is the Free State of Saxony.\nBefore 1806 Saxony was the Electorate of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire. This meant that the princes who ruled Saxony were prince-elector and could help elect a new Holy Roman Emperor.\nWhen Emperor Francis II was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz and the empire was dissolved the electorate became an independent kingdom. The last elector of Saxony became King Frederick Augustus I. \nAfter the Battle of Jena in 1806, Saxony joined the Confederation of the Rhine, and remained within the Confederation until it broke up in 1813 when Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Leipzig. \nThe Catholic ruler of Saxony was one of the few German leaders to support the French. Saxony was put under Russian occupation and 40% of the Kingdom, including the historically significant Wittenberg, home of the Protestant Reformation, was taken by Prussia, but Frederick Augustus was allowed back to rule the remainder of his kingdom, which still included the major cities of Dresden and Leipzig.

The town lies on the banks of the river Mulde ca. 20 kilometres northeastern the city of Leipzig. It belongs to the Nordsachsen Rural District and is subdivided into the urban districts \"Mitte\", \"Ost\" and \"Berg\" (Stadtteile) and the villages \"Behlitz\", \"Hainichen\", \"Kospa\", \"Pressen\", \"Wedelwitz\" and \"Zschettgau\" (Ortsteile).\nEilenburg occupies and has about 17.000 inhabitants as of 31 December 2009.\nHistory.\nThe castle of Eilenburg was first mentioned at 29 July 961 in a document by Otto I. as \"civitas Ilburg\". The name has Slavic origin and means \"town in clay deposits\". Probably in the 11th century there has developed a settlement of purchase people in the advance of the castle, that forms the origin of the today's town of Eilenburg.\nIn the 16th century Eilenburg was a centre of the reformation events. Even George, Duke of Saxony, called this town a \"nominated place\" (\"namhaftigen Ort\"). Martin Luther was total seven times in Eilenburg and called it a \"blessed lard pit\" (\"gesegnete Schmalzgrube\"). It is passed that he took it into consideration to set here in the old. \nThe Thirty Years' War left hard mark in Eilenburg. First the town was spared of fighting, but it already suffered from the catastrophic economic effects of the war. From the year 1631 the town was directly involved in the war. In 1632 the body of Gustav II Adolf, King of the Swedish, was laid out in \"Red Deer Inn\" (\"Gasthof Roter Hirsch\") after he had been killed in the Battle of L\u00fctzen the 16 November 1632. In 1639 Eilenburg was conquered by the troops of Georg von Derfflinger. In 1646 peace negotiations between Saxony and Sweden began in Eilenburg to extend the expiring Armistice of K\u00f6tzschenbroda. The 14 September 1648 the Treaty of Eilenburg was made and meant the end of the Thirty Years' War for total Saxony. Subsequently the town recovered. \nThe slow onset of economic recovery got a sudden end by the began of the Seven Years' War. Virtually each male in Eilenburg had to serve in the armed forces. The city was occupied alternately by the Austrians and Prussians. In the following Eilenburg turned into an impoverished and squandered town. In the end of the 18th century the economy stagnated and Eilenburg became an insignificant town.\nIn 1813 during the Napoleonic wars shortly before the Battle of Leipzig Napoleon was in Eilenburg and took the last view on his and the allies Saxon troops eastern Eilenburg. After Napoleon's defeat, Saxony had to cede large territory to Prussia under the provisions of the Congress of Vienna. Eilenburg now belonging to the very modern Prussian state. Thereby the transition of Eilenburg to an industrial city was advanced significantly. \nBecause of the founding of numerous textile factories Eilenburg next to Berlin became most important centre of Prussian textile production. The ascent to an important industrial city came mainly from the nearby Saxony. Saxon industrialists settled in Eilenburg for having duty-free access to the Prussian market. Onset urbanization caused a rapid rising of the population. The social tensions resulting from the industrialization and the huge growth of population promoted a strong labour movement. In 1849 the \"health insurance support association\" (\"Krankenkassenunterst\u00fctzungsverein\") was founded. In 1850 the \"food association of Eilenburg\" (\"Eilenburger Lebensmittelassociation\") as first food cooperative of Germany and \"Darlehnskassenverein\" as first Credit union in Germany were founded. Carl Degenkolb, owner of a factory in Eilenburg and member of Frankfurt Parliament, instituted first German works councils voluntarily at his factory. \nIn 1872 Eilenburg received its first railway. The 30 June Halle-Eilenburg-Falkenberg route was opened. Two years later transport services started on the new built Eilenburg-Leipzig route. Industrial development continued rapidly by settlement of chemical, wood and metal processing industry. The \"German Celluliod Factory\" (\"Deutsche Celluliod-Fabrik\") that settled in 1887 characterized the city's business for more than a hundred years.\nDuring World War I hundreds of Eilenburg people were called up for military service. The 21 October 1917 Wilhelm Pieck, the later President of GDR escaped from a military transport at Eilenburg station. Total about 800 people from Eilenburg were killed during the war.\nAbout two weeks before the end of the World War II the city was almost completely destroyed. 17. April 1945 the American troops reached Eilenburg. It was ordered defense to extremes. Three days and three nights the town was under heavy artillery fire, that destroyed most of the buildings of the city. The meaningless defense killed two hundred people, 90 percent of the City Centre (65 percent of the buildings of the whole city) were destroyed while the American associations had nearly no losses. Eilenburg was one of the hardest destroyed cities in Germany.\nThe city centre was rebuilt in the 1950s. In 1952 the city became the seat of the Eilenburg Rural District newly formed by the administrative reform in the GDR. In the east part of Eilenburg large new housing areas emerged. In autumn 1989 up to seven thousand inhabitants formed peaceful demonstrations reaching a change (\"Wende\") especially on political level. After the German reunification some long-established companies got out of business. Dismantling of jobs could only be partially offset by new business settlements on newly created industrial areas outside the city. In 1994 Eilenburg Rural District got merged with Delitzsch Rural District in the course of district reform. So the city lost the seat of district.\nIn 2002 Eilenburg was hit hard by flood of the river Mulde. The thereby caused damages amounted to EUR 135 million. The construction of flood protection facilities was intensified after the flood. In 2008 the construction measures ended after investments amounting to EUR 35 million. Eilenburg was the first city in Saxony that is completely protected against flood. Since 1 August 2008 Eilenburg lies approximately in the middle of the newly formed Nordsachsen Rural District."}

The Al-Aqsa Mosque is a part of the Al-Haram al-Qudsi al-Sharif, or \"The Noble Sanctuary\". This area is known as the Temple Mount by Jews, and it is believed to be the location where the Jewish Temple was built. The mosque is the 3rd most important place in Islam. Muslims believe that Muhammad went from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the story of the \"Night Journey\". Also, some Islamic traditions say Muhammad led prayers there before his ascension.\nAttacks.\nPeople have planned to attack the mosque, and some people have actually attacked it. In 1969 Michael Dennis Rohan set the mosque on fire, destroying a lot of the mosque. Some members of the Gush Emunim Underground planned to blow up the mosque, but they never blew it up.\nIn September of 2000 Ariel Sharon visited Al-Aqsa, and Palestinians who were at the mosque threw objects at the police force that was with Sharon. In return the police shot rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians. Palestinians said Sharon visited the mosque to make people angry, but Sharon said he had gone there with a message of peace. This visit is what some believe caused the Second Intifada.\nName.\n\"Al-Aqsa Masjid\" means \"the farthest Mosque\". The masjid's name comes from a story in the Quran called \"The Night Journey\". In the story Muhammad goes from Makkah to East Jerusalem, where the Al-Aqsa Masjid is. Then he went up to Heaven (Jannah).\nHistory.\nThe mosque was first built in 705 AD. The first mosque was destroyed in an earthquake in 748 AD and had to be built again. We do not know when it was built again, but it was probably in 771 AD, and this mosque was destroyed soon after they finished building it. The third mosque was built around 780 AD. In 1033 AD there was another earthquake, and the mosque had to be built again.\nEast Jerusalem was taken over by the Crusaders in 1099. Instead of taking down the mosque, the crusaders used the mosque as a palace. In 1119 it was changed into the headquarters for the Templar Knights."}

It is made up of the German-speaking Community and the municipalities of Malmedy and Waimes (Weismes), which belong to the French-Speaking Community of Belgium.\nThe East Cantons were part of the Rhine Province of Prussia in Germany until 1920 but were annexed by Belgium following Germany's defeat in World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles. Thus they also became known as the \"cantons r\u00e9dim\u00e9s\", \"redeemed cantons\". The peace treaty of Versailles demanded the \"questioning\" of the local population about their political status.\nThis was not a secret vote, and anyone who did not want to become Belgian had to register their full name and address. Many locals feared reprisals or even expulsion after enlisting.\nIn the mid-1920s the kingdom of Belgium seemed to want to sell the region back to Germany. The French government told the Belgians to stop the Belgian-German talks about the deal.\nIn 1940 the new cantons were retaken by Germany in World War II.

There are four different types of county:\nIts county town is Durham.\nThe form of the county name is unique in England. Many counties are named after their principal town, and the expected form here would be \"Durhamshire\". But County Durham did not become a Shire/County until after the language of government was changed from Anglo-Saxon to Norman French in 1066. Previous to that it was a semi-independent Bishopric.\nDurham County Council promotes the non-metropolitan county for tourism purposes as \"The Land of the Prince Bishops\" in reference to the former palatine jurisdiction of the bishops.\nDefinitions.\nHistoric County.\nThe historic county covered from the Pennines in the west, the River Tees in the south, the North Sea in the east and the Rivers Tyne and Derwent in the north.\nThe county several had a number of exclaves: Bedlingtonshire, Islandshire and Norhamshire within Northumberland, and Craikshire within the North Riding of Yorkshire. The historic boundaries were used for parliamentary purposes until 1832, and for law courts and local government until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county.\nAdministrative county.\nIn 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888 England and Wales was divided into administrative counties and county boroughs. Administrative counties, governed by an elected county council, were based on the historic boundaries, less larger towns which became self-governing as county boroughs.\nIn 1889 the administrative county of Durham consisted of the historic county less the county boroughs of Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland. The boundary with the North Riding of Yorkshire was adjusted: the part of the town of Barnard Castle that was in Yorkshire was added to County Durham, but the part of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees in Durham was given to the North Riding. For all non-administrative purposes, such as lieutenancy, the County of Durham comprised the administrative county and associated county boroughs.\nOver its existence, the administrative county lost territory, both to the existing county boroughs, and also due to the creation of county boroughs at West Hartlepool in 1902 and Darlington in 1915. In 1967 the borough of Hartlepool was removed from the administrative county when it merged with West Hartlepool to form a new county borough of Hartlepool, and in 1968 Billingham was included within the boundaries of the county borough of Teesside, associated with the North Riding.\nThe administrative county was abolished in 1974.\nNon-metropolitan county.\nIn 1974 Durham was divided between three counties. The boroughs of Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees became a part of the new non-metropolitan county of Cleveland. The metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear became responsible for Gateshead, Sunderland and South Tyneside. The new non-metropolitan county of Durham also covered the former area of Startforth Rural District, a part of the historic North Riding of Yorkshire, and south of the historical boundary of the River Tees.\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government has said that the seven district councils and the County Council will be abolished and a new unitary authority for the whole of the existing County Council area will be created. The change will be on 1 April 2009 at the latest. The successful Durham County Council bid referred to the new authority as County Durham Council.\nCeremonial county.\nIn 1997 the non-metropolitan county (including unitary Darlington), together with that part of the former county of Cleveland north of the River Tees became a ceremonial county. Lord-lieutenants and high sheriffs are appointed to the ceremonial county of Durham. they have no job in local government.\nSettlements.\nThis is a list of the main towns in County Durham.

They also have movable quadrate bones, which make it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the braincase. This is particularly visible in snakes, which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey. \nThey are the most variably-sized order of reptiles, ranging from the 16\u00a0mm (0.63 in.) Dwarf gecko (\"Sphaerodactylus ariasae\") to the 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft.) Green Anaconda (\"Eunectes murinus\").\nThis is the only living reptile group which has both viviparous and ovoviviparous species, as well as the usual oviparous (egg-laying) reptiles.\nThe Squamata does not include the Tuataras from New Zealand. They are a sister group to the squamates. The Crocodilia are much more distantly related.\nEvolution.\nSquamates are a monophyletic group that is a sister group to the tuatara. The squamates and tuatara together are a sister group to crocodiles and birds, the living archosaurs. \nSquamate fossils first appear in the early Jurassic, but a mitochondrial phylogeny suggests that they evolved in the late Permian. The evolutionary relationships within the squamates are not yet completely worked out, with the relationship of snakes to other groups being most problematic. \nFrom morphological data, Iguanid lizards have been thought to have diverged from other squamates very early, but recent molecular phylogenies, both from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, do not support this early divergence. Because snakes have a faster molecular clock than other squamates, and there are few early snake and snake ancestor fossils, it is difficult to resolve the relationship between snakes and other squamate groups.\nEvolution of venom.\nRecent research suggests that the evolutionary origin of venom lies deep in the squamate phylogeny. 60% of squamates are venomous Toxicofera. \nVenom in the families Caenophidia, Anguimorpha, and Iguania evolved once, then the three families diverged. All three lineages share nine common toxins. The fossil record shows that the divergence between anguimorphs, iguanians, and advanced snakes dates back roughly 200 MYA to the Upper Triassic/Lower Jurassic.\nSnake venom evolved by the duplication of a gene encoding for a normal regulatory or bioactivity protein. Then the copy was expressed in the venom gland. \nDifferent toxins have been recruited from different proteins and are diverse as the functions themselves. \nNatural selection has driven the diversification of the toxins to counter the defences of the prey. Venom genes form large multigene families, and evolve by protein evolution. This leads to a diversification of toxins that let sit-and-wait predators attack a wide range of prey. \nThe rapid evolution and diversification is the result of a prey/predator evolutionary arms race where each adapts to counter the other.\nTaxonomy.\nClassically, the order is divided into three suborders:\nOf these, the lizards form a paraphyletic group. In newer classifications the name Sauria is used for reptiles and birds in general, and the Squamata are divided differently:"}

The Bodhi tree is easily recognised because of its heart-shaped leaves.\nThe word \"Bodhi tree\" is also applied to some existing trees, particularly the Sacred Fig growing at the Mahabodhi Temple, which is probably a direct descendant of the original tree. This tree is a frequent place for pilgrims to visit, being the most important of the four holy sites for Buddhists.\nHistorical events.\nThe Bodhi tree at the Mahabodhi Temple is called the Sri MahaBodhi. According to Buddhism, after his Enlightenment, Buddha spent a whole week in front of the tree, standing with unblinking eyes, gazing at it with gratitude. A shrine was later built where he had stood.\nThe spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of Buddha, the only shrine that could be so used.

His queen, Tissarakkh\u0101 was jealous of the Tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Asoka's reign), she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thorns. The tree, however, grew again, and a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda called the Bodhimanda Vihara. Among those present at the foundation of the Mah\u0101 Th\u016bpa are mentioned thirty thousand monks from the Bodhimanda Vihara, led by Cittagutta.\nTo Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.\nSome Part of Bodhi Tree was sent to Sri Lanka by Ashoka which was planted in 288 BC, making it the oldest verified specimen of any plant. In this year (the twelfth year of King Asoka's reign) the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamitt\u0101 to Anur\u0101dhapura and placed by Dev\u0101n\u0101mpiyatissa in the Mah\u0101meghavana. Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved \"Mahavamsa\" From Gay\u0101, the branch was taken to P\u0101taliputta, then to T\u0101malitt\u012b, where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at Anuradhapura, staying on the way at Tivakka.

The branch of Kakusandha's tree was brought by a nun called Ruc\u0101nand\u0101, Konagamana's by Kantak\u0101nand\u0101 (or Kanakadatt\u0101), and Kassapa's by Sudhamm\u0101."}

A straight line drawn through the periapsis and apoapsis is the \"line of apsides\". This is the major axis of the ellipse, the line through the longest part of the ellipse.\nSimilar words are used to identify the body being orbited. The most common are perigee and apogee, referring to orbits around the Earth, and perihelion and aphelion, referring to orbits around the Sun (Greek \u2018\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \"h\u0113lios\" sun). During the Apollo program, the terms pericynthion and apocynthion were used when referring to the moon.\nPerihelion and aphelion.\nThe perihelion is the point in the orbit of an object that is nearest to the Sun. The aphelion is the point in the orbit of an object where it is farthest from the Sun.\nAll planets, comets and asteroids in our solar system have approximately elliptical (a kind of non-circular) orbits. Thus, they all have a closest and a farthest point from the sun: a perihelion and an aphelion. Orbital eccentricity measures the flatness of the orbit. Any single revolution of a body around the sun is only approximately elliptical, because the precession of the perihelion prevents the orbit from being a simple closed curve such as an ellipse. This causes Milankovich cycles. \nEarth comes closest to the sun every year around January 3. It is farthest from the sun every year around July 4. The difference in distance between Earth's nearest point to the sun in January and farthest point from the sun in July is . Earth is about from the Sun in early January, in contrast to about in early July.\nWhen Earth is closest to the Sun, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere. Thus it is possible to see that Earth's distance from the Sun does not noticeably cause the seasons to change; the relatively minor effects of differences in distance is somewhat masked by the mainly oceanic southern hemisphere vs the half-continental northern hemisphere. Therefore, the Earth's seasons come and go mainly because Earth does not rotate with its axis exactly upright with respect to the plane of the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. Earth's axial tilt is 23.5 degrees. This puts the Sun farther south in December and January, so the north has winter and the south has summer. Thus winter falls on that part of the globe where sunlight strikes least directly. Summer falls on that part of the globe where sunlight strikes most directly."}

Its definition is: the length of the semi-major axis of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun. \"Semi-major\" means half the long axis.\nThe AU is about 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles. Astronomers usually measure distances within the Solar System in astronomical units. Mars is about 1.4 AU from the Sun, Jupiter lies at roughly 5.2 AU, and Neptune is roughly 30 AU from the Sun. Light travels an AU in about 8.317 minutes.\nMore accuracy.\nFrom 1976 to 2012 the AU was defined as \u201cthe radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with a mean motion of 0.01720209895 radians per day (known as the Gaussian constant)\u201d.

One theory says that it is related with the fact that a year is approximately 360 days. Some ancient calendars, for example the Persian calendar and the Babylonian calendar, used 360 days for a year.\nAnother theory says that the Babylonians divided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle.

The Mandinka people lived there. It is also called the Manding Empire or Manden Kurufa. Sundiata Keita started the empire and the empire became famous because its rulers were very rich, especially Mansa Musa I. The Mali Empire had many important cultural effects on West Africa, spreading language, laws and customs along the Niger River. This was because of the spread of Islam by verbal wording.\nFor such a prolific empire, there are few written accounts of its greatness. Most of the written accounts that do exist came from Arab scholars who traveled through the region. In lieu of written accounts, most of the stories from the locals were passed down through oral histories, songs and poems. Until this day, \u2018griots\u2019 still tell stories of the ancient history in the area. Architects in the Mali Empire combined styles of the Sahel region and Middle East together, particularly after Emperor Musa\u2019s pilgrimage to Mecca. There were several royal palaces built during the time, many of which are still standing. Mud bricks, log beams and plaster helped these palaces to remain standing. The most famous work of architecture from the time period is the Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mosque was rebuilt in 1907 and can still be visited in Djenn\u00e9. However, if you aren\u2019t a Muslim, you can\u2019t go inside. \nThe Mali Empire had one of the richest leaders in history. The richest and most famous of all the leaders of the Mali Empire was Mansa Musa. It is thought by some that Mansa Musa could have been the wealthiest person in history. According to stories, he took 60,000 people on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324 along with camels loaded down with gold. \nIslam was very important to the Mali Empire. Most of the kings of the Mali Empire eventually converted to Islam, with their people subsequently practicing as well. However, unlike many empires, they didn\u2019t make their subjects convert, and the version of Islam that they practiced was combined with the local traditions of the villages. You can still see many relics in cities like Bamako, Djenn\u00e9 and Timbuktu. \nThe Mali Empire's most important industry was gold. People in the ancient world were drawn to it. The Mali Empire (Timbuktu in particular) was a huge trading center for the gold industry. Camel caravans would come to the area before leaving across the trans-Saharan trade routes. The empire had so much gold that it caused the market to crash for a period of time when Mansa Musa brought almost a ton of gold to Cairo. The army of the Mali Empire was massive.\nDuring the height of the Mali Empire, the army numbered around 100,000 men and 10,000 cavalry, making it one of the largest in the world at the time. The empire used this army to gain new lands."}

They are always being fixed, but are threatened because the desert is spreading.\nSonghay, Tuareg, Fulani, and Mand\u00e9 people live in Timbuktu. It is about 15 km north of the Niger River. There is a route across the Sahara Desert from east to west and this is used for trade. There is another from north to south. These two routes meet in Timbuktu. It is an \"entrep\u00f4t\" for rock salt from Taoudenni. This means that the salt is brought here and sold to other people to take it somewhere else, but no tax is charged.\nIts location helped different people meet, so local people, Berbers and Arabs met here. It has a long history of mixed African trade, so it became famous in Europe for this reason. Therefore, western people often thought of Timbuktu as being exotic. It has a hot desert climate (\"BWh\" in the Koeppen climate classification).\nTimbuktu has given a lot of research and study to Islam and to the world.

She had plans to record all the organ works of Olivier Messiaen. However, she died relatively young, at age 47, of cancer, before she was able to finish this task.\nShe wrote many compositions, especially for the organ. These include: \"Nativit\u00e9\", \"Six \u00c9tudes\", \"Sept M\u00e9ditations sur le Saint-Esprit\", \"Triptyque\", \"Twelve Choral-Preludes on Gregorian Chant Themes\", \"Te Deum\", \"R\u00e9pons pour les Temps Liturgiques\", and \"Pr\u00e9lude et fugue en UT\"."}

Often, it is just called a mouse. It is a small rodent. In most parts of the world, they live close to humans. Laboratory mice are types of house mice and are some of the most important organisms used for research in biology and medicine. They are the most commonly used laboratory mammal for experiments.\nDescription.\nThey are quite small, but are not the smallest mammals. House mice have an adult body length (nose to base of tail) of 7.5\u201310 cm (3.0\u20133.9 in) and a tail length of 5\u201310 cm (2.0\u20133.9 in). The weight is typically 10\u201325 g (0.4\u20130.9 oz). In the wild they vary in color from light to dark agouti (light to dark brown). Selected strains of mice can be got in various other colours.\nIt is a small, scaly-tailed mouse with a distinct notch in the cutting surface of upper incisors (seen best in side view). Its hair short; ears moderately large and naked. \nPhysiology.\nThe main problem of small mammals is their high surface to weight ratio: they have a big surface area for such a small mass. Since heat is radiated from the surface, they have adaptations to help them keep their temperature up to normal. They need to eat frequently, and live in areas where they are protected from the coldest weather. Easy access to high-quality vegetable food (such as grains) and a protected habitat helps them survive and multiply. That is why they are found in numbers living in human settlements.\nLife cycle.\nTheir life-span in the wild averages about a year. They are eaten by a variety of small carnivores, but they reproduce rapidly, so that keeps the numbers up. Females have 314 babies in a litter, and can have 5 to 10 litters a year. In good conditions, the mouse population rises quickly.\nHabitat.\nAlthough not native to North America, the house mouse was introduced accidentally to seaport towns. It is now widespread throughout the United States. It occurs either as a commensal or feral animal in practically all parts of the U.S. \nAs commensal animals, house mice live in close association with man \u2013 in houses, outbuildings, stores, and other structures. Where conditions permit, feral mice may be found in fields, along watercourses, and in other places where vegetation is dense enough to hide them."}

These beliefs are based on written words by L. Ron Hubbard. A few other people have added, but almost all of it is his. He started it in 1954. Hubbard contributed until his death in 1986. \nDifferent people understand the words Hubbard wrote differently. In some countries, there are Churches of Scientology. Some people are suspicious of the Church. They feel that it is a cult, and a business to make money. Scientology has been controversial since it began.\nScientology teaches that people are immortal spirits who have forgotten their true nature. Scientologists say that, through a system called \"auditing\", they help people remember their true nature by re-experiencing painful events in their past and understanding them better. \nThere are many organizations that are linked to Scientology. For example, some help people stop using harmful drugs or to get back into society after they served a prison term. \nScientology says that psychiatry is bad, and should not be allowed to exist.\nNumber of followers.\nThe Church of Scientology says that 13-15 million people are a part of the Church. Critics disagree with that figure, however. They say the organization probably does not have more than 100,000 followers, mostly in the United States. They say that in 1960, there were probably 50,000 to 100,000 followers in the U.S. In the 1990s, a representative survey claimed there were only about 45,000 followers left. These figures seemed to have increased a bit, by 2004, where there were an estimated 55,000 followers.\nThe Church of Scientology.\nThe Church of Scientology was started by the American writer and philosopher L. Ron Hubbard in the year 1954. It is not as well known as Christianity or Islam, but it is newer. Scientologists believe their movement is growing. They claim it has thousands of churches, some of which are very small. The largest is in Clearwater, Florida.\nAims of Scientology.\nL. Ron Hubbard wrote about the goals of Scientology, saying:\nThis means the goals of Scientology are to create a civilization where:\nIn 1972, Hubbard told a group of Scientologists: \"You are the people the planet obeys. You are the people who own the planet.\"\nDianetics.\nScientologists say that the book Dianetics was the first self-help book ever written. It was written by L Ron Hubbard in the year 1950. Some key concepts in the book are:\nARC triangle.\nAnother basic teaching of Scientology is that understanding comes from three things together:\nHubbard called this the \"ARC Triangle.\" Scientologists use this in their everyday lives. It is based upon the idea that making one of these three things better makes the other two better.\nTone scale.\nThe tone scale is a way to rate an emotion as bad, better, or good. The scale goes from -40 (\"Total Failure\") to +40 (\"Serenity of Being\"). Positions on the tone scale started from the idea that one way of feeling is better than a worse way of feeling. But Hubbard described many other things that go along with emotion, such as health, mating behavior, survival potential, and ability to deal with truth. The tone scale is frequently used by Scientologists to understand people. According to Scientology, the lower the individual is on the tone scale, the more complex his problems are.\nWell-known members.\nMany well-known people are followers of Scientology. They include:"}

It was preceded by a Zollverein, a customs union that allowed free trade among most German states. The Confederation started in August 1866, and the Kingdom of Prussia was the leading state. On July 1st 1867, the North German Constitution made the alliance a federal state.\nAn Austrian-Prussian rivalry, starting in the 1700s, had led to the Austro-Prussian War of July/August 1866. Immediate causes for the war had been the unsettled question of Slesvig-Holstein (which Prussia intended to annex) and a reform of the German Confederation. After a victory in summer 1866, agreements with Austria and France allowed Prussia to reshape the political landscape in Northern Germany (north of the river Main). The leading politician of Prussia was minister president Otto von Bismarck, serving under king William I.\nOn 18 August 1866, Prussia and most of the north German states signed the August Treaty. They agreed on a military alliance and declared their intention to create a federal state. (Some other states joined soon.) A federal state is different from an alliance as it has a federal government and legislation, and it is different from a unitary state as there are still rather powerful states below the federal level. Plans for a federal state in Germany had existed since the year 1848.\nUnion.\nThe allied governments led by Bismarck made a proposal for a North German constitution. An organ was elected to represent the people of Northern Germany, the \"konstituierender Reichstag\". The election took place in February 1867. After some modifications of the proposal, the states' governments and parliaments accepted the final draft. On July 1st, the constitution came into force.\nAccording to the constitution, legislation was the matter of two organs. The \"Reichstag\" was the parliament, elected by all men above the age of 25. The Federal Council was an organ representing the governments of the states. The holder of the \"Bundespr\u00e4sidium\" was the king of Prussia (the 'republican' term 'president' had been avoided intentionally). The holder of the \"Bundespr\u00e4sidium\" installed the Federal Chancellor. Not by name, but factually this was the (only) federal minister, the head of the executive.\nIn 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, the South German states joined the North German Confederation. The new constitution of January 1st, 1871, renamed the country from 'North German Confederation' to 'German Empire'. The holder of the \"Bundespr\u00e4sidium\" received the additional title of an Emperor. The political system as described in the constitution, and the flag, remained the same. (The final constitution of the Empire stems from April/May 1871; as a result, nearly all terms that included 'federal' were changed to 'imperial'.)\nThe modern national state of Germany is, as an international subject and as a legal entity, identical to the North German Confederation. Law and international treaties of the era 1867-1870 are in principle still valid. In a conservative-liberal cooperation lasting from 1867 to 1878, Germany saw a remarkable modernisation and unification. The North German Confederation introduced the metric system, a modern penal code (Strafgesetzbuch), same rights for all denominations, a postal union etc.\nPostage stamps.\nThe federation handled the mail and issued postage stamps, after 1 January 1868. But the federation did not issue its own money, so different stamps had to be issued. Stamps valued in groschen were used in the north, stamps in kreuzer in the Southern District. All of these stamps were marked \"NORDDEUTSCHER POSTBEZIRK\" (North German Postal Area).\nA third set of stamps were printed for Hamburg. These were also marked \"STADTPOSTBRIEF HAMBURG\"."}

It is also known as the argument of perihelion or the argument of perifocus. It is the angle (starting from the center of the orbit) between an orbiting body's periapsis and its ascending node. Periapsis is the point when the orbiting object comes the closest to the thing it is orbiting around; for example, the moon is at periapsis when it is closest to the Earth. The ascending node is one of two places where an orbiting object passes through the reference plane, an imaginary flat surface which runs through the object being orbited around. The size of the angle depends on which way the object is orbiting.\nThe angle is measured in the orbital plane and in the direction of motion. For specific types of orbits, words such as \"perihelion\" (for Sun-centered orbits), \"perigee\" (for Earth-centered orbits), \"pericenter\" (general), etc. may replace the word \"periapsis\".\nAn argument of periapsis of 0\u00b0 means that the orbiting body will be at its closest approach to the central body at the same moment that it crosses the plane of reference from south to north.

The porcupine is the third biggest rodent, after the capybara, and beaver, and are not to be confused with hedgehogs. Most porcupines are about 60\u201390\u00a0cm long, with a 20\u201325\u00a0cm long tail. Weighing between 12-35\u00a0pounds (5\u201316\u00a0kg), they are rounded, large and slow. Porcupines come in various shades of brown, grey, and the unusual white. The name \"porcupine\" comes from Middle French \"porc d'\u00e9pine\" \"thorny pork\", hence the nickname \"quill pig\" for the animal. The correct term for a\u00a0baby\u00a0porcupine is a porcupette. A porcupette has soft quills made of hardened hair. This protects the mother from injury as she gives birth.\nThe animal's quills or spines take on many forms, depending on the type, but all are hairs coated with thick plates of keratin, and they are in the skin musculature. Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) have quills in clusters, whereas in New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) single quills are mixed with bristles, underfur, and hair.\nPorcupine quills are as sharp as needles, can be removed very easily, and will stay stuck in an attacker. Unlike needles, however, the quills of New World porcupines have small, backwards-facing barbs on the tip that catch on the skin making them hard and painful to pull out. Quills are about 75\u00a0mm long and 2\u00a0mm wide. If a quill becomes put in the tissues of an attacker, the barbs act to pull the quill farther into the tissues with the normal muscle movements of the attacker, moving up to many millimeters in a day. Animals who try to eat porcupines have been known to die because of quill penetration and infection. Quills can still penetrate animals and humans even after death. The ancient belief that porcupines can throw their quills at an enemy has long been proved to be incorrect.\nPorcupines can live in a wide range of places in tropical and mild parts of Asia, Italy, Africa, and North and South America. Porcupines live in forests, deserts and grasslands. Some live in trees, others stay on the ground.\nPorcupines in search of salt sometimes live in human places, eating plywood cured with sodium nitrate, certain paints, and tool handles, footwear, clothes and other items that have been coated in salty sweat. Porcupines like going near roads in areas where rock salt is used to melt ice and snow, and are known to gnaw on vehicle tires or wiring coated in road salt. Salt licks placed nearby can stop porcupine damage.\nNatural sources of salt used by porcupines include different salt-rich plants (such as yellow water lily and aquatic liverwort), fresh animal bones, outer tree bark and mud in salt-rich soils."}

The Albertine duchies of Weissenfels, Merseburg and Zeitz were are also sometimes called \"Saxon duchies\" and border several Ernestine ones.\nOverview.\nThe old Duchy of Saxon began to split up in the 15th Century, because law said that all sons should inherit. All of the sons of a Saxon duke had the title of \"Duke\", sometimes brothers ruled the territory together, and sometimes they divided it up between them. Some of the Ernestine duchies stayed independent until 1918. The nearby royal houses of Reuss and Schwarzburg also divided up their territory, so Thuringia was a tangle of little states, exclaves and enclaves from the late 15th Century until the early 20th Century.\nBackground.\nAlbert, grandson of Albert \"the Bear\" inherited the Duchy of Saxony from his father. Albert's sons divided Saxony into the duchies of Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. When duke of Saxe-Wittenberg died without an heir in 1422, the Emperor Sigismund gave the duchy to Frederick IV of the House of Wettin. Frederick was already Margrave of Mei\u00dfen and Landgrave of Thuringia, and then became Frederick I, Elector of Saxony. Frederick was followed as Elector by his son Frederick II, and when Frederick II died in 1464 his sons Ernest and Albert took over. Because he was the older, Ernest became Elector of Saxony, but the brothers shared ruling the lands until 1485. Then Ernest took northern Mei\u00dfen, southern Thuringia, and Wittenberg, with Albert receiving northern Thuringia and southern Mei\u00dfen\nThe Ernestine line.\nElector Ernest died in 1486, and was succeeded by his son, Frederick III, the Wise.\nIt was Frederick the Wise who set up the University of Wittenberg in 1502. This was because the only university in Saxony was in Leipzig, was in the part of Saxony controlled by the descendants of his uncle, Albert. The University of Wittenberg was were Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses. Frederick protected Luther, and did not send him to Rome for trial. Frederick allowed Lutheran reforms in his country.\nFrederick the Wise had three grandsons to share the territory. John Frederick II set up his capitals in Eisenach and Coburg, the middle brother John William staying in Weimar (Saxe-Weimar), and the youngest, John Frederick III took Gotha (Saxe-Gotha).\nJohn Frederick III of Gotha died unmarried and heirless in 1565 and John William of Weimar tried to claim Saxe-Gotha, but the sons of the imprisoned John Frederick II entered their own claim.\nIn 1572 the claimants agreed to the Division of Erfurt. This treaty said John William of Saxe-Weimar would also take the districts of Altenburg, Gotha and Meiningen.\nWhen John William died a year later.\nThe older son of John Frederick II, and John Ernest (d 1638 heirless), the younger son of John Frederick II, received together the territory of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. In 1596 the brothers agreed to split the duchy into Saxe-Coburg and Saxe-Eisenach.\nJohann II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (or John II), died young but left eight surviving sons who ruled together, Three died, (including Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the youngest, the famed general) and a will ordering them to rule jointly. Only three survived by 1639, when the lands of the Coburg-Eisenach dukes were divided between the Altenburgs and the Weimarsthe remaining brothers finally divided their lands which were twice the size of what they inherited.\nWilliam kept Weimar, Albert became Duke of Eisenach and Ernest \"the Pious\" became known as Duke of Gotha.\nErnest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (1601-75) had married Elisabeth Sophie, the only child of John Philip, Duke of Altenburg(1597-1638). Elisabeth Sophie's cousin Frederick William III, Duke of Altenburg, died unmarried 1672. He was the last male descendant of the first Saxe-Altenburg line.\nThere was a big argument about who should get the Altenburg land. In the end most went to Ernest and Elisabeth Sophie's sons. One quarter the original Altenburglands went to the Saxe-Weimar branch.\nThese two lines: Weimar and Gotha(-Altenburg) form the basis of future Ernestine lines, and both have surviving male lineage up to today.\nAfter the division of the first Altenburg lands line, the senior Ernestine branch (the Saxe-Weimar family ), line held just under half of the Ernestine lands, and the junior, Gotha-Altenburg, line held more than half. Gotha-Altenburg line divided more each generation. The Weimar line did not subdivide their land and by 1741 all of the land was controlled by the one branch of the Weimar family. In 1815 they became Grand Dukes.\nDuke Ernest of Gotha and Duchess Elisabeth Sophie's numerous sons divided the inheritance into seven parts: Gotha-Altenburg, Coburg, Meiningen, R\u00f6mhild, Eisenberg, Hildburghausen and Saalfeld. The new dukes of Coburg, R\u00f6mhild and Eisenberg had no children, so their lands were quickly absorbed by the four remaining lines.\nEventually, primogeniture (that is, only the eldest son inherits) became the rule for inheritance in the Ernestine Duchies.\nIn 1825 the Ernestine duchies were\nIn 1825 Ernest the Pious' senior line, the Gotha-Altenburg, went extinct and the land was redistributed for the last time.\nAltenburg went to the Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen, but he gave Hildburghausen to the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen-Hildburghausen. The duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld gave up Saalfeld in return for Gotha.. All of the Ernestine Duchies ended with the abolition of the monarchy and princely states in Germany shortly after the end of World War I.\nFive rulers of the Ernestine duchies \nhad a vote in the Holy Roman Empire\u2019s Reichstag. In 1792 the Duke of Saxe-Weimar was also the Duke of Saxe-Eisenach, and the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg was also the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, so both had two votes; and the Duke of Saxe-Coburg had one vote.\nThe other Ernestine duchies were never members of the Imperial Circle, and were subordinate to the five duchies that did belong to the Imperial Circle (for example, the principalities of Meiningen and Hildburghausen were such; that was one reason why Duke of Hildburghausen exchanged his patrimony to that of Altenburg). Ultimately, in the German Confederation, all these became equally sovereign."}

It is the last great work of Lange and his most famous book today. It is said that \"Miranda\" is an \"occultic fiction\" and a \"romance ranked to a philosophical treaty\". The novel is also known as a mix of dystopia and utopia. \nThe novel was translated into English (in 1968), French, Spanish and Italian.\nExplanation of the novel's title.\nThe novel's title refers to the character Miranda, from Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\". \"Miranda\" also has been influenced by work such as: \"Men Like Gods\" by Herbert George Wells; \"The City of the Sun\" by Tommaso Campanella; \"Lenore\" by Edgar Allan Poe,;\"Genezis z Ducha\" by Juliusz S\u0142owacki; poems by Cyprian Kamil Norwid; writings of Friedrich Nietzsche (criticism of concept of the \u00dcbermensch); Arthur Schopenhauer; Plato; and Sanskrit epics of ancient India.\nPlot summary.\nThe novel tells about a civilization of Brahmans who have powerful skills. They can speak with their minds, and levitate (float in the air). The Brahmans in the book think the most important things are anarchy, freedom, peace, and free love. Their country is led by the Ministry of Love, Ministry of Power and Ministry of Wisdom. The Brahmans use a strange chemical named Nivridium to keep their self-perfect idea. The story is the of a Polish emigrant named Jan Podob\u0142oczny (Lange's own \"parte-parole\") falling in love with a woman named Damayanti. The book ends in a tragedy. In the last chapter of the novel, Damayanti sacrifices her body in order to let her spirit fly to a greater level of though.\nMiranda is a Scottish spiritual medium, who lives in Warsaw. She can talk with the soul of Damayanti and make a woman named Lenore appear. She meets Jan Podob\u0142oczny when he is close to his death. In the moment when Damayanti dies, Miranda disappears."}

It weighs about a hundred pounds, and is about two feet tall at the shoulder. The capybara is the world's largest rodent. \nCapybaras are closely related to guinea pigs and to chinchillas. When they are full-grown, they weigh about 55 kg, or 100 pounds. The capybara's stocky body is about a meter, or 3 feet, long, and its shoulder is about 60 centimeters, or about two feet, high off the ground. Females are usually bigger and heavier than males. Capybaras have brown or reddish-brown fur. When they are old their fur is thin, their skin can get sunburned easily. Their eyes and ears and nostrils are high on their heads, so they can easily be kept above water when the capybara is swimming.\nLifestyle.\nCapybaras live in grassy wetlands or close to rivers in many parts of South America. In the morning, evening, and at night they eat grass, mostly on land. They spend the hottest hours of the day in the water. They are good swimmers and divers. Webs between their toes help them swim. They can only hold their breath under water for about five minutes at a time. Sometimes they hide in water for much longer, with only their noses sticking out to breathe. Many predators like to eat them. They are a favourite food for jaguars, eagles, anaconda snakes, and many other animals. \nCapybaras eat plants, mostly grass. Their babies are usually born in litters of four at one time. They can start to eat grass once they are about a week old, but they will also keep nursing from their mothers and even from other grown females until they are about four months old. They live in large groups, usually 10-30 capybaras together. Some groups have even had 100 capybaras. They talk to each other using many sounds: clicks, grunts, whistles, and barks. \nConservation and contact with humans.\nCapybaras are not endangered. Their population is stable, not increasing or decreasing very much. They can live in towns or zoos. Humans can touch them, but it is not common, as it can cause disease. Sometimes humans eat capybaras. They are hunted for meat, and sometimes they are raised on farms. Also, their tough skin is sometimes used to make high quality leather, especially for gloves. Capybaras are sometimes kept as pets. They can be kept pets in the United States, but not in some places. They are also very liked in Japan, and are kept as pets there too."}

Not only are house flies a nuisance, but they also carry disease-causing organisms. Flies are not only an irritant to farm workers but may be a public health concern. Houseflies are pests and can carry diseases.\nEach female fly can lay about 9,000 eggs in its life, in several batches of about 75 to 150. The eggs are laid on or near meat, often dead animals. Within a day, larvae (maggots) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed on dead and decaying organic material, such as garbage, carrion or faeces. They are pale-whitish, and have no legs. Their life cycle is from 14 hours to 36 hours. \nAt the end of their third instar, the maggots crawl to a dry, cool place and turn into pupae. These are coloured reddish-brown and about 8\u00a0mm long. From the pupae emerge adult flies. The whole cycle is known as complete metamorphosis. \nAdults live from two weeks to a month in the wild. After they come out from the pupae, the flies do not grow. Small flies of the same species did not get enough food when they were larvae.The function of an adult fly is to reproduce."}

Sometimes they are put into a family of their own, the Aceraceae. At other times they are included in the Sapindaceae. To include them in the Sapindaceae is the more modern classification. There are between 100 and 200 species of maples. Most species are native to Asia, but some also occur in Europe, Northern Africa, and North America. \nThe word \"Acer\" comes from a Latin word meaning \"sharp\". It was given because of the characteristic sharp points on the maple leaves. The first person to talk about the genus that way was French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1700. The type species of the genus is \"Acer pseudoplatanus\" (the sycamore maple).\nSeed dispersal.\nThe maple's distinctive fruit are called samaras, and known by many children as \"helicopters\" by the way they spin as they fall. Inside the fruit are found their seeds, which are in pairs. Each one is enclosed in a \"nutlet\" attached to a flattened wing of papery tissue. They are shaped to spin as they fall and carry the seeds a considerable distance on the wind. One tree can release hundreds of thousands of seeds at a time. Some seeds can remain in the soil for several years before germinating.\nWhat are maples used for?\nMaple trees are often planted as ornamental trees in cities. Some species resist the cold rather well. Sugar maples are grown to make maple syrup. Some maples are grown for timber (wood that is used for furniture).\nSymbolism.\nThe flag of Canada shows a maple leaf. "}

Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 when the Netherlands became an independent kingdom, and King William I of the Netherlands was made Grand Duke of Luxembourg. In 1890, the two countries separated. William III of the Netherlands had no male heir, so in the Netherlands he was succeeded by Queen Wilhelmina but Luxembourg followed Salic law, which meant only a man could rule. The present Grand Duke of Luxembourg is Henri.\nHowever there are other houses of Europe that style themselves as Grand Dukes even if not wholly recognised by the rest of society.\nThe independent republics of Finland and Lithuania, and the Dutch province Limburg (Duchy of Limburg) have been Grand Duchies at certain times in their history.\nThe title and origins of grand duchies.\nThe title Grand Duke (Latin: \"Magnus Dux\", German: \"Gro\u00dfherzog\", Italian: \"Gran Duca\", French: \"Grand-Duc\", Swedish: \"Storhertig\", Lithuanian:\"Didysis kunigaik\u0161tis\", Polish: \"Wielki ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119\", Czech: \"Velkov\u00e9voda\") ranks in honour below King but higher than a sovereign Duke (\"Herzog\") or Prince (\"F\u00fcrst\"). \nA Grand Duke (or Grand Duchess) is a person who rules a Grand Duchy. But in the English language \"Grand Duke\" can also mean a type of prince who does not rule a country, but is related to the monarch. In the Russian language \"Velikiy Knjaz\" are \"Grand Princes\", relatives of the Tsar, other princes were noblemen who ranked above a duke. English says Grand Duke instead of Grand Prince.\nList of grand duchies.\nBetween the Napoleonic Wars and World War I there were at least eight grand duchies in Europe: \nA lot of grand duchies were created in the Napoleonic era and by the Congress of Vienna and the German Confederation.\nThe Duchy of Warsaw(1807-1813) is sometimes called a Grand Duchy but it was not. \nToday Luxembourg is the only remaining grand duchy. However some old Grand Duchies still retain the titles granted to them usually in the Congress of Vienna.\nForm of address.\nMost reigning Grand Dukes were called \"Royal Highness\". Titles and styles for other members of the families were different. In Hesse-Darmstadt and in Baden, junior members were called \"Grand Ducal Highness\". \nThe only current grand ducal family in existence, Luxembourg, styles calls its junior members \"Royal Highnesses\", but they were also Princes of Parma.\nA Russian Grand Duke or Grand Duchess was an \"Imperial Highness\"."}

He was the President of the Republic in 1951, as interim. He started and led the Estado Novo (\"New State\"), the authoritarian, right-wing government that ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1974.\nEarly life.\nSalazar was born in Vimieiro, Santa Comba D\u00e3o, Portugal. His father had been a farm worker who became the farm manager for the Perestrelos family. His great grandfather had been a landowner and nobleman. He studied at the Viseu Seminary from 1900 to 1914 with the hope of becoming a priest. He changed his mind and studied Law at University of Coimbra.\nFollowing a military revolution in 1926 which overthrew a civilian government of squabbling politicians and a country close to failure, Dr. Salazar was invited to take control of the finances of the then-failed state. Dr. Salazar was Finance Minister for 13 days, but resigned in disgust over interference by politicians and soldiers and went back to his university. He was again persuaded to take over as Finance Minister in 1928, which he did conditionally on an assurance of greater powers for himself with minimal interference from the military. Salazar continued as minister until 1932, and was widely credited with turning the fledgling economy around.\nAs Prime Minister.\nDr Salazar was Prime Minister from 1932 until 1968.\nHe ruled Portugal for almost 40 years, managing to keep Portugal away from the Second World War as well as preventing a Spanish invasion by keeping friends with both sides. Salazar died in 1970. Often called a fascist by his opponents, Dr Salazar's regime was instrumental in issuing Portuguese travel documents to thousands of Jews fleeing though Europe and to Portugal a boarding point for the ultimate destination in North America. Unfortunately Dr. Salazar's contribution to this humanitarian cause was never acknowledged as this activity had to be toned down in the later years of the war. Instead, the overzealous Consul to France Aristides de Sousa Mendes is often given credit, despite the fact that it was he who recklessly endagered the operation by issuing a flood of travel documents in assembly line fashion. Tens of thousands of such documents were issued by him in the months of June and July of 1940. Salazar's cease-and-desist orders to Mendes are often highlighted. Incidently, the United States had issued similar instructions to all its missions abroad many years earlier, purportedly because of the fear that Germany would smuggle in spies amongst fleeing Jewish refugees. President Hoover ordered U.S. consuls to strictly interpret the LPC clause of the immigration law. President Franklin Roosevelt failed to push for a change in immigration laws and policy. \nA little known fact is that Salazar's Portugal was the only European nation at the time to have non-white people at all levels of administration and judiciary. Dark-skinned people termed \"colonial subjects\" by other contemporary colonial powers very rarely qualified for rights similar to those enjoyed by the citizens of their colonial masters. Portugal accorded its subjects full civil status. It was the only state anywhere in the western world to have non-European non-white Members of Parliament. This status, however, was not universally available to the black people of the African territories i.e. those who were not \"assimilados\" (which literately translates to \"assimilated\") which meant those Africans who had not given up their tribal customs nor reached minimum educational standards. Roughly 4% of the African populace was considered \"assimilado\" while the people native to the overseas colonies of Cape Verde, India, and China were considered universally \"assimilados\" even though in the latter two territories, people were not largely Roman Catholic nor did most speak the Portuguese language.\nIn the mid-sixties, Portugal and its colonies found themselves in the front line of the Cold war, with a proxy war which drained Portugal of its resources. Salazar was blamed for a war he had no control over as well as the consequent impoverishment of his country. Thousands from mainland Portugal fled into neighbouring European countries, particularly France, to avoid the military draft and the war in Africa. Most took up menial jobs and were a convinient source of low cost labour to Europe. This expatriate segment of society became increasingly empowered after a military coup overthrew the government of Salazar's successor Marcello Caetano in 1974. Many returned to Portugal to become next generation politicians.\nThe term \"fascist regime\" probably stems from an attempt by this sizable group to demonize the fallen regime and justify their flight from a country at war.\nSalazar is still loved by some of the people of Portugal today, and was voted the greatest Portuguese man of all time. Apologists say that it was more as a way of showing frustration with the current political events and politicians in Portugal than actually a true devotion. A great segment of the Portuguese people though may beg to differ.\nThe colonies.\nIn 1945 Portugal had large colonial Empire, including Cape Verde Islands, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Principe, Angola (including Cabinda), Portuguese Guinea, and Mozambique in Africa; Goa, Dam\u00e3o (including Dadra and Nagar Haveli), and Diu in India; Macau in China; and Portuguese Timor in Southeast Asia. Salazar was determined to keep control of Portugal's territories. After the war the colonies were in a mess. The Indian nationalists in Goa wanted their country to join with the new independent state of India. There strikes and protests by the local people against the Portuguese. The Indian Armed Forces invaded and took over Goa, Daman and Diu in 1961. Revolutions against the Portuguese were started in Mozambique, Angola, and Portuguese Guinea.\nDeath.\nIn 1968, Salazar suffered a major stroke, reportedly caused by falling from his chair at his summer house. President Am\u00e9rico Thomaz was forced to replace him with Marcelo Caetano on September 27, 1968. Salazar died in Lisbon on July 27, 1970. Tens of thousands of people went to the funeral and the Requiem Mass and watched the journey of the special train that carried his coffin to his hometown of Santa Comba D\u00e3o. He was buried next to his ancestors and the farmers of the region, in a plain ordinary grave.Decades as a \"dictator\" and Salazar's worldly possessions were almost the literal \"shirt on his back\" . He died without ever having purchased a motor car, the modest house he lived in Lisbon belonged to the State and is reported as having had two pairs of suits in his wardrobe."}

The concept of the show was taken from one of the tasks Nikki undertook while in the \"Big Brother\" house. During the task, she was assigned as Big Brother's personal assistant and had to carry out various duties, which often resulted in Nikki throwing a tantrum and refusing to comply.\nThe theme music for the programme has been adapted from the 1982 hit single \"Hey Mickey!\" by Toni Basil, with the lyrics \"Hey Nikki!\" used as a replacement.\nContrary to rumors, no second season is planned.

Athens and Sparta were was the greatest sea power, and Sparta the greatest land power in 5th century BC Greece.\nIn the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese attempting to suppress signs of unrest in its empire.\nThis period of the war ended in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a large force, organized by Alcibiades, to attack Syracuse in Sicily. The attack failed, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC.\nThe final phase of the war is called the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from the Achaemenid Empire, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire. Eventually, Athens lost its naval supremacy. The destruction of the Athenian fleet in a battle in 405 BC effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year.\nResults.\nThe Peloponnesian War reshaped the Ancient Greek world. Athens, the strongest city-state in Greece before the war started, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection. Sparta became the leading power of Greece.\nThe economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece; poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese, Athens was completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity.p488 The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society; the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made civil war a common occurrence in the Greek world.\nGreek warfare, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the Peloponnese War marked the dramatic end to the fifth-century BC 'Golden age of Greece'.xxiii-xxiv"}

It is within the County Durham local government district, and is the county town of the larger ceremonial county. It lies to the south of Newcastle upon Tyne, Chester-le-Street and Sunderland and to the north of Darlington.\nDurham is well known for its Norman Cathedral and 11th-century castle, and is home to Durham University. HM Prison Durham is also close to the city centre. Durham Castle and Cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nArcheological evidence shows settlement in the area since 2000 BC. The present city can clearly be traced back to AD 995, when a group of monks from Lindisfarne chose to settle there with the body of Saint Cuthbert, which had previously lain in Chester-le-Street.\nMedieval history.\nBefore the Reformation the shrine of Saint Cuthbert, behind the High Altar of Durham Cathedral, was the most important religious site in England until the martyrdom of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury.\nDespite a brief translation back to Holy Island during the Norman Invasion the saint's relics remain enshrined to the present day. Saint Bede's bones are also entombed in the cathedral, drawing the mediaeval pilgrim to the city.\nDurham\u2019s geographical position has always given it an important position in the defence of England against the Scots. The city has played an important part in the defence of the north and Durham Castle is the only Norman castle keep never to have suffered a breach. The Battle of Neville's Cross which took place near the city on 17 October 1346 between the English and Scots was the most famous battle of its age.\nThe city suffered from a number of plague outbreaks in 1544, 1589 and 1598.\nPrince Bishops.\nAs the north east was so far from Westminster the bishops of Durham enjoyed extraordinary powers. They had the ability to hold their own parliament, raise their own armies, appoint their own sheriffs and Justices, administer their own laws, levy taxes and customs duties, create fairs and markets, issue charters, salvage shipwrecks, collect revenue from mines, administer the forests and mint their own coins.\nBasically, William the Conqueror delegated many powers to bishops in the furthest reaches of England. They were his men, and most had fought at the Battle of Hastings. This style of delegation ran for many centuries afterwards. This applied especially in the north and west of England, which were several days ride from London.\nSo far reaching were the bishop\u2019s powers that the steward of Bishop Anthony Bek commented in 1299 AD: \nAll this activity was administered from the castle and buildings surrounding the Palace Green.\nEvery Bishop of Durham from 1071 to 1836 was a Prince Bishop except for the first Norman-appointed Bishop Walcher who was styled an Earl-Bishop. The last Prince Bishop of Durham Bishop William Van Mildert founded Durham University. Henry VIII cut some of the Prince-Bishop's powers and, in 1538, ordered the destruction of the shrine of Saint Cuthbert.\nLegal System.\nThe Prince Bishops also had their own court system, most notably the Durham Court of Chancery. The county also had its own attorney general, whose authority to bring an indictment for criminal matters was tested by central government in the infamous case of \"Rex\" v. \"Mary Ann Cotton\" (1832). The courts and judicial posts for the county were finally abolished in 1873.\nComposition of the Council.\nThe Council is made up of 50 councillors elected every four years (last elections 2007). In 2007, the council was made of Liberal Democrat (30), Labour (17), and Independent (3) members.\nLiberal Democrats first took control of the council in the 2003 elections. Labour had held overall control of the City Council continually since the early 1980s."}

It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian general who served in that war. The war was fought between the \"Peloponnesian League\" (led by Sparta) and the \"Athenian league\" (led by Athens). The war lasted more than 20 years.\nMany historians regard this \"History\" of Thucydides as one of the earliest scholarly works of history.\nHistorical method.\nThucydides' \"History\" made a number of contributions to early historiography. Many of his principles have become standard methods of history writing today, though others have not.\nChronology.\nOne of Thucydides' major innovations was to use a strict standard of chronology, recording events by year, each year consisting of the summer campaigning season and a less active winter season. As a result, events that span several years are divided up and described in parts of the book that are sometimes quite distant from one another, causing the impression that he is oscillating between the various theatres of conflict. This method contrasts sharply with Herodotus' earlier work \"The Histories\", which jumps around chronologically.\nSpeeches.\nAnother feature of the work is that Thucydides writes dozens of speeches of the most important figures who were engaged in the war. Thucydides heard some of these speeches himself but some of the speeches he wrote without knowing exactly what was really spoken.\nNeutral point of view.\nThucydides wanted his writings \"to last for ever\" (1.22.4). Therefore he tried to be as neutral as possible though as general of Athens that was difficult for him.\nRole of religion.\nThe gods play no active role in Thucydides' work. This is very different to Herodotus, who frequently mentions the role of the gods. Instead, Thucydides regards history as being caused by the choices and actions of human beings.\nThe \"History\" concentrates on the military aspects of the Peloponnesian War, but it uses these events as a medium to suggest several other themes as well, for instance to show degenerative effects of war on humanity itself. \nFor the most part, the \"History\" does not discuss topics such as the art and architecture of Greece, but speaks of the development of military technologies\nrather often. \nThe \"History\" explains that the cause of the Peloponnesian War was the \"growth in power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Sparta\" (1.23.6). The Spartans represent a more traditional and less expansive power.\nSources.\nThucydides almost never names his informants. This is in contrast to Herodotus, who frequently mentions multiple versions of his stories and allows the reader to decide which is true.\nInfluence.\nThucydides' \"History\" has been enormously influential in both ancient and modern historiography."}
{"id": "76817", "revid": "1052699", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76817", "title": "Historiography", "text": "Historiography is about the writing of history and the use of historical methods. Thus it looks at authors, sources, interpretation, style, bias, and audience. It is sometimes called \"the history of history\". The word historiography can also refer to a body of historical work.\nThe history of written history.\nFor thousands of years people have been telling stories about the past, and making written records of the actions of kings and prophets and other famous persons. After 500 BC, they began writing more organized histories.\nHellenic world.\nWritten history appeared first with the ancient Greeks, whose historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The very first historical works were \"The Histories\" composed by Herodotus of Halicarnassus (484 BC\u2013ca.425 BC), who became later known as the 'father of history' (Cicero). \nThucydides was the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, and his successor Xenophon (ca. 431\u2013355 BC) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his Anabasis.\nRoman world.\nThe Romans adopted the Greek tradition, becoming the first people to write history in a non-Greek language. The most famous writers are Julius Caesar's (100 BC\u201344 BC) \"Bellum Gallicum\".\nLivy (59 BC\u2013AD 17) who records the rise of Rome from city-state to world dominion.\nPlutarch (c. 46 - 127) and Suetonius (c. 69-after 130) introduced biography as a branch of history. Tacitus (c. 56\u2013c. 117) criticizes Roman immorality by praising German virtues.\nMedieval Europe.\nWriting history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the Middle Ages. They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, the Church and of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers. In the Early Middles Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year but this style tended to hampered the analysis of events and causes. An example of this type of writing are Anglo-Saxon Chronicles which were the work of several different writers and start during the reign of Alfred the Great in the late 9th century and one copy of which was still being updated in 1154.\nHistory was written about states or nations during the Renaissance. The study of history changed during the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Voltaire described the history of certain ages that were important according to him, instead of describing events in a chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called \"philosophia historiae\" anymore, but merely history (\"historia\").\nModern era.\nModern historiography began with Leopold Ranke in the 19th century, who was very critical on the sources used in history. \nThe French Annales School radically changed history during the 20th century. Fernand Braudel wanted history to become more scientific by demanding more mathematical evidence in history, in order to make the history discipline less subjective. Furthermore, he added a social-economic and geographic framework to answer historical questions. Other French historians, like Philippe Ari\u00e8s and Michel Foucault described history of daily life topics such as death and sexuality. They wanted history to be written about all topics and that all questions should be asked.\nHistorical journals.\nHistorical journals for academic historians to exchange ideas started in the nineteenth century. The early journals were similar to the academic journals used in the physical sciences, and were seen as a means by which history could be professionalised. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was \"Annales. \u00c9conomies. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Civilisations.\" a publication instrumental in establishing the Annales School.\nApproaches to history.\nThe question of how a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important questions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\nSome of the more common historigraphical approaches are:\nDeterminism.\nDeterminism means that historians view history as being caused more by certain factors than by other factors. The two most common types of determinism are geographic determinism and economic determinism. Geographic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by geography. Frederick Jackson Turner was a proponent of geographic determinism. Economic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by economics. Charles Beard was a proponent of economic determinism. Other historians believe that history is caused mostly by politics or mostly by a struggle for natural rights, but these are usually not labeled as determinism."}

The ISBN system was created in the United Kingdom, in 1966, by the booksellers and stationers W.H. Smith.\nOriginally, it was the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code and still was used in 1974; it was adopted as the international standard ISO 2108 in 1970. A similar, numeric identification, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines. Since January 1, 2007, ISBNs are of 13 digits, like in Bookland EAN-13. The TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for the standard.\nOverview.\nAn ISBN is given to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned after January 1, 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 or 5 parts:\nThe ISBN parts may be of different lengths, and usually are separated with hyphens or spaces.\nThe group identifier code (GIC) number is 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japanese; 5 for Russian, et cetera. The original standard book number (SBN) had no group identifier, but affixing a zero (0) as prefix to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN. The group identifier may be up to 5 digits long; e.g. 99936 is a group identifier for the country Bhutan.\nThe national ISBN agency assigns the publisher number (cf. the category: ISBN agencies); the publisher selects the item number. Generally, a book publisher is not required to assign an ISBN, nor for a book to display its number (except in China; see below), however, most book stores only handle ISBN bearing merchandise.\nA listing of all the 628,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form, but, as of 2007, it costs US$300. The web site of the international ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes.\nOther websites.\n[[Category:Publishing]]\n[[Category:Book terminology]]\n[[Category:ISO standards]]"}

The seafloor moves and carries continents with it. At ridges in the middle of oceans, new oceanic crust is created. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. \nAt the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (and other places), material from the upper mantle rises through the faults between oceanic plates. It forms new crust as the plates move away from each other. The new crust then slowly moves away from the ridge. It is a place of earthquakes and volcanos. Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in plate tectonics. At oceanic trenches, seafloor crust slides down and under continental crust.\nEarlier theories (e.g. by Alfred Wegener) of continental drift were that continents 'plowed' through the ocean. The modern idea is that the ocean floor itself moves and carries the continents with it as it expands from a mid-ocean ridge. Today, it is accepted. The phenomenon is caused by convection in the weak upper mantle, or asthenosphere.\nAdditionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4-9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm/year. \nMid-ocean ridge.\nA mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain system. This consists of mountain chains, with a rift valley running along its spine, formed by plate tectonics. A mid-ocean ridge marks the boundary between two tectonic plates which are moving apart. A mid ocean ridge is made by a divergent boundary.\nThe mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean. The mid-oceanic ridge system is the longest mountain range in the world. The continuous mountain range is long. It is several times longer than the Andes, the longest continental mountain range. The total length of the oceanic ridge system is long.\nHow it works.\nMid-ocean ridges are geologically active, with new magma constantly emerging onto the ocean floor and into the crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro.\nThe rocks making up the crust below the sea floor are youngest at the axis of the ridge and age with increasing distance from that axis. New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earth's mantle.\nThe oceanic crust is made up of rocks much younger than the Earth itself: oceanic crust in the ocean basins is everywhere less than 200 million years old. The crust is in a constant state of 'renewal' at the ocean ridges. Moving away from the mid-ocean ridge, ocean depth progressively increases; the greatest depths are in ocean trenches. As the oceanic crust moves away from the ridge axis, the peridotite in the underlying mantle cools and becomes more rigid. The crust and the relatively rigid peridotite below it make up the oceanic lithosphere. \nSlow spreading ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have large, wide rift valleys, sometimes as big as 10-20 km wide and very rugged terrain at the ridge crest. By contrast, fast spreading ridges like the East Pacific Rise are narrow, sharp incisions surrounded by generally flat topography that slopes away from the ridge over many hundreds of miles."}

Raccoons are in the family Caniformia, and are related to the mustelids.\nThe raccoon has short legs, pointed nose, small ears, grayish-brown fur, and a bushy tail.\nThe raccoon's most distinctive features are its multi-purpose front paws, its facial 'mask', and its striped tail. moreover, Raccoons are noted for their intelligence. Studies show they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years. Raccoons are usually nocturnal. Their food is about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant foods, and 27% vertebrates. Raccoons are omnivores. They eat mice, squirrels, rabbits, birds, fish, frogs, turtles, lizards, eggs, insects, worms, fruit, berries and nuts. Their predators include red foxes, wolves, coyotes, bears, eagles, owls, cougars, lynx and bobcats.\nMost raccoons live in the wild. Being around humans does not bother them. They often nest in empty buildings, garages, sheds, and even the attics of houses. Raccoons do not hibernate in the winter. Those that live further north where it is colder, grow thick coats to keep them warm and spend long periods sleeping. Raccoons that live in captivity can survive up to 20 years. In the wild, they usually live only 1\u20133 years.\nTwo other species of raccoon, the crab-eating raccoon (\"P. cancrivorus\") and the Cozumel Island raccoon (\"P. pygmaeus\"), are extremely similar to the common raccoon. The crab-eating raccoon is quite widespread in eastern South America.\nAfter a gestation period (pregnancy) of about 65 days, two to five young are born in spring. Newborn raccoons are called \"kits\"."}

She was also the main character in the series \"Tru Calling\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nDushku was born in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dushku's father is Albanian-American and her mother has Danish ancestry. She was raised a Mormon, the faith of her mother but she is not actively practicing. She has three older brothers, Aaron, Benjamin (Ben) (born February 5, 1976), and Nathan (Nate) (born June 8, 1977, in Boston, Massachusetts), the last of whom is also an actor and a model. Her parents divorced when she was still an infant.\nEarly career.\nDushku started acting when she was 10. She was chosen for the lead role of Alice, opposite Juliette Lewis in the movie \"That Night\". In 1993, Dushku got the role as Pearl in \"This Boy's Life\", alongside Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. The following year, she played the teenage daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in \"True Lies\". She also had parts as Paul Reiser's daughter in \"Bye Bye, Love\", as Cindy Johnson with Halle Berry and Jim Belushi in \"Race the Sun\", as well as roles in a television movie and a short movie.\nDushku took some time off from acting to finish her last two years of high school. She was accepted to the George Washington University in Washington, DC and Suffolk University in Boston, where her mother was professor of government and had been the dean of the campus in Dakar, Senegal.\nLater roles.\nAfter high school, Dushku returned to acting with the role of Faith, a Slayer much more troubled than the main character Buffy. At first, her character was only going to be used for five episodes but became so popular that Joss Whedon decided to use her for more of the story. She stayed on for the rest of the third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four. She was then used as part of the first season of the \"Buffy\" spinoff series \"Angel\". Faith returned as a heroine in several other episodes of \"Angel\" and in the last five episodes of \"Buffy\".\nIn 2000, Dushku starred in \"Soul Survivors\" with her \"Race The Sun\" co-star Casey Affleck. She followed that up with the cheerleader comedy \"Bring It On\" with Kirsten Dunst.

It uses the words which are a traditional part of the service. The choir is usually accompanied by the organ, but sometimes it can be just for choir without organ.\nIn Morning Prayer the words which are set to music for the choir are the words of the Venite (Psalm 95), the Te Deum and the Jubilate (Psalm 100) or Benedictus.\nFor a Holy Communion the set words will usually be the Gloria, sometimes the Creed, Sanctus, Agnus Dei as well as responses.\nFor Evening Prayer the words will be the Magnificat and the Nunc Dimittis. Singers in the choir often call these \"Mag and Nunc\" for short. Many composers have set these words. They make them into a piece for choir which is like an anthem.\nIn the Tudor and early Stuart periods, services were described as \"Short\", \"Great\" or \"Verse\" services. Short services were short, the words were only sung once and it was often unaccompanied (no organ). A Great service was longer: some of the words were often sung many times. William Byrd wrote a famous Great Service. A Verse service was also long: there were several verses which need to be sung by a solo choir member. In between each verse there is some music for the whole choir to sing."}

Common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, biotite and other micas, augite and the calcium-rich plagioclase feldspars. Common mafic rocks include basalt and gabbro.\nIn terms of chemistry, mafic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the so-called felsic rocks. The term roughly corresponds to the older \"basic\" rock class.\nMafic lava, before cooling, has a lower viscosity than felsic lava due to its lower silica content. Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava, so eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic lava eruptions. Most mafic lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes, like Hawaii."}

These plants grow fast and produce flowers and many seeds in a short period of time.\nIn Botany, the word for a herbaceous plant is herb (from Latin \"herba\", \"grass\") but it is common to use the word herb only for plants that are used in perfumes, medicines and for cooking, even if they are not herbaceous plants.\nHerbaceous plants may be annuals, biennials or perennials but most are annuals and die at the end of their growing season (the time when they produce flowers, fruits and seeds), leaving their seeds on the soil; those seeds will produce new plants with good weather. Wheat and pea are annual herbaceous plants.\nBiennial and perennial herbaceous plants will live for two or more years but the stems that are in the air will die every year; the underground stems will form the new aerial stems (stems that are above the ground). Underground roots and stems can resist more the bad weather (winter or a very dry season) than leaves and stems that are above the ground. Bulbs are biennal and peonies are perennial herbaceous plants\nMost herbaceous plants are small and their stems are not thick because they do not have much wood but there are some cases of big herbaceous plants. Bananas and papaya (a tropical fruit) are herbaceous plants but they look like trees; papaya has a thick stem but without much wood.\nHerbaceous plants are the first plants with flower that come to live in barren lands (lands without plant life) because they are small and produce many seeds. They are also found in places where the weather conditions are not good for most plants; they can use the little rain that falls in deserts, and they can get enough heat to grow where the soil is covered with snow and ice most of the year, like in very high mountains."}

{"id": "77105", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77105", "title": "Nickel Creek", "text": "Nickel Creek was an American acoustic musical group. Although the group's music has roots in bluegrass, Nickel Creek now calls itself \"progressive acoustic\". The band has three people: Chris Thile (mandolin), Sean Watkins (guitar), and Sara Watkins (violin). A fourth member also plays bass with the band. Chris Thile's father Scott Thile, Byron House, and Derek Jones have played bass with the group. Mark Schatz has played bass with Nickel Creek since 2003. The band has played songs by Radiohead, Elliott Smith, Bob Dylan, and even \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears. However, most of the songs the band play are originals.\nHistory.\nThe band started in California in 1989 with Scott Thile, Chris' father, playing the double bass. The oldest of the children, Sean Watkins, was only twelve years old at the time. In the early days, Nickel Creek made two albums: \"Little Cowpoke\" in 1993, and \"Here to There\" in 1997. \n\"Nickel Creek\": 2000\u20132001.\nAlison Krauss produced the album \"Nickel Creek\", which came out in 2000 on Sugar Hill Records. It was awarded a gold certification in 2002 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nickel Creek got two Grammy Award nominations for the album: Best Bluegrass Album and Best Country Instrumental for \"Ode to a Butterfly\". Three singles, \"When You Come Back Down\", \"The Lighthouse's Tale\", and \"Reasons Why\" were released with music videos, and the first two were on the US Country chart. The album itself topped the Billboard Heatseekers chart, and reached number 125 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nTo help sell the album, Nickel Creek toured with artists like Lyle Lovett, Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, and Amy Grant.\n\"This Side\": 2002\u20132004.\nIn 2002, \"This Side\" came out and it was also produced by Alison Krauss. It reached number 18 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and was also made gold by the RIAA. \"This Side\" was different from the first album by adding more pop and rock. Chris Thile described the album in 2002: \nOn the \"This Side\" tour of 2002 and 2003, Nickel Creek played shows as the main act for the most part, but also opened five shows for John Mayer in November 2002 in Upstate New York and New England, and played with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings earlier in the year. In 2003, Nickel Creek was on B\u00e9la Fleck's album \"Little Worlds\".\nNickel Creek also released three singles from \"This Side\": \"This Side\", \"Speak\", and \"Smoothie Song\". \"This Side\" appeared on the US Country chart, but the others did not chart with Billboard. However, \"Smoothie Song\" topped the AAA Contemporary chart for three weeks.\n\"Why Should the Fire Die?\": 2005.\nNickel Creek released \"Why Should the Fire Die?\" in August 2005. The album brought even more rock and pop to Nickel Creek's sound, just as \"This Side\" did. Chris Thile talked about the band's genre and style in a 2005 interview from \"JamBase\": \"We actually feel like more than a bluegrass band that stretched out. We are a band that incorporates bluegrass into our music. There's been a problem in perception. 'Bluegrass band leaves the fold' (uses a news announcer voice). No, no, no, no, no. Actually, it's a band that incorporates a little bluegrass into whatever the hell kind of music they play.\" Sean Watkins also said: \n\"Farewell (For Now)\": 2006\u20132007.\nOn August 28, 2006, Nickel Creek announced on their website that they would not be together as a band anymore. The message was:\nAfter the break was announced, a tour was scheduled. To say goodbye to their fans, the tour was named the \"Farewell (For Now)\" Tour, because the band does not know if they will get together again. The tour started in April 2007 and ended in November 2007 in Nashville, Tennessee. The tour had many guest appearances by musicians like Fiona Apple, Glen Phillips, Jon Brion, Bruce Molsky, B\u00e9la Fleck, and Tift Merritt.\nWhen talking about Nickel Creek's last tour before the break, Sara Watkins said \"A lot of the other stuff will be special in the way that anything is special when you realize that it\u2019s not going to be around forever... Nothing is going be Nickel Creek except Nickel Creek. I\u2019m not looking for anything to top this. It can\u2019t be duplicated in my life.\""}
{"id": "77107", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77107", "title": "Six-Day War", "text": "The Six-Day War was a war that started on 5 June 1967 and ended 10 June 1967. Israel fought Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, but many other countries helped the different sides.\nHistory.\nThe war began by Egypt planning to capture Israel, which was seen by the Arab world as an illegitimate state. The war also began because of fear of an attack from Israel as suggested by soviet intelligence and from internal pressure within Egypt. Egypt, Syria, and Jordan gathered troops and prepared for battle, and Arab authorities made clear their intentions for the destruction of Israel. Israel began the mounting precautionary troops against their borders with Syria, Egypt and Jordan as their prime reason. \nThe Israeli air raids were described as preemptive, a first strike against the Egyptians. This surprise attack was against the Egyptian airfields. The Egyptians had 50 runways and about 960 attack aircraft, and the Israelis had 300 attack craft. Israel attacked while Egypt's planes were still on the ground. In three, hours nearly the entire Egyptian Air Force was wiped out. That surprised the Egyptians, and Israel went on to attack on the ground. Israel was then attacked by Syria and Jordan and defeated them both. \nThe entire war lasted only six days. As a result, Israel claimed lands that had great strategical and historical importance for it. The war led to the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where Egypt took back part of the Sinai, but Israel took part of the West Bank. Eventually, Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt but kept the lands acquired from Jordan. The UN requested Israel to retreat to the pre-1967 borders and to help form an Arab-Palestinian state. Negotiations and intermittent fighting continued.\nBackground.\nEgyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser has been described as the first leader of an Arab nation who challenged what was perceived as the Western dominance of the Middle East. He ordered a concentration of Egyptian military forces in the sensitive Suez zone. That act was highly provocative, and the Israelis viewed it only one way: Egypt was preparing to attack.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was established in May 1964 in Jordan and combines various Arab organisations under one banner. In its infancy, the PLO was not associated with violence, but from 1967 on, it became dominated by an organisation called Fatah, meaning \"liberation\" in Arabic. It was the Syrian wing and was led by Yasser Arafat.\nMilitary preparation.\nBefore the war, Israeli pilots and ground crews had trained extensively in rapid refitting of aircraft returning from sorties to allow a single aircraft to sortie up to four times a day; the norm in Arab air forces was one or two sorties per day. That enabled the Israeli Air Force (IAF) to send several attack waves against Egyptian airfields on the first day of the war, overwhelm the Egyptian Air Force, and knock out other Arab air forces on the same day. The Arabs were so surprised that many have mistakenly believed that Israel had foreign help, especially from the United States.\nOn May 26, 1967, the Central Intelligence Agency estimated, \"The Israelis ... If they attack now they ... would still be able to drive the Egyptians away from the entrance to the Strait of Tiran, but it would certainly cost them heavy losses of men and mat\u00e9riel.\nOn the eve of the war, Israel believed it could win a war in 3\u20134 days. The United States estimated that Israel would need 7\u201310 days to win. British estimates supported that view.\nArmies.\nThe Israeli Army had a total strength, including reservists, of 264,000, but that number could not be sustained, as the reservists were vital to civilian life. Israel deployed about 40,000 troops and 200 tanks (8 brigades). Israeli Central Command forces consisted of five brigades. The first two were permanently stationed near Jerusalem and were called the Jerusalem Brigade and the mechanized Harel Brigade. Mordechai Gur's 55th paratrooper brigade was summoned from the Sinai front. The 10th Armored Brigade was stationed north of the West Bank.On the eve of the war, Egypt massed approximately 100,000 of its 160,000 troops in the Sinai, including all of its seven divisions (four infantry, two armoured, and one mechanized), four independent infantry brigades, and four independent armoured brigades. No fewer than a third of them were veterans of Egypt's continuing intervention into the North Yemen Civil War and another third were reservists.\nWeapons.\nWith the exception of Jordan, the Arabs relied principally on Soviet weaponry. Jordan had an army was equipped with American weaponry, and its air force was composed of British aircraft.\nEgypt had by far the largest and the most modern of all the Arab air forces, consisting of about 420 combat aircraft, all of them Soviet-built and with many top-of-the line MiG-21s. Of particular concern to the Israelis were the 30 Tu-16 \"Badger\" medium bombers, which could inflict heavy damage on Israeli military and civilian centers."}

It is for teachers of English who teach people whose first language is not English. It lists tests with brief descriptions.\nTypes of exam.\nCambridge exams.\nThe Cambridge exams are very popular in Europe. The University of Cambridge ESOL makes these exams. There are five exams for general English. Students take these exams in many schools. Students can take the exams in England or in schools in many other countries.\nThe Cambridge exams test: \nThe easiest exam is the KET. KET means \"Key English Test\". The KET is the start of the Cambridge exams. The KET tests basic English.\nThe PET is more difficult. PET means \"Preliminary English Test\". People with a PET know some English. They can survive social situations in English. They can also survive work situations in English. But they often find English difficult. They also make many mistakes.\nThe FCE is the most popular of the Cambridge English exam. FCE means \"First Certificate in English\". The FCE is good for many businesses. People with a FCE can use English. They sometimes find English difficult. Normally they have no problems with English. But they make mistakes.\nThe CAE is a difficult exam. CAE means \"Certificate in Advanced English\". The CAE is good for many universities. The CAE is also good for many businesses. People with a CAE have no problems working in England or United States of America.\nThe CPE is the most difficult exam. CPE stands for \"Certificate of Proficiency in English\". People who have a CPE are very good at English. Their English is nearly as good as people who are from England or America. The CPE is good for universities. The CPE is also good for business. Many universities who teach courses in English want a CPE or CAE from foreign-language students.\nThere are two English exams systems for business. The \"Business English Certificate\" (BEC) is available at three levels comparable to PET, FCE and CAE above BEC means . The BULATS \"Business Language Testing Service\" is a single examination which can offer organisations or individuals the opportunity of assessing their current language level.\nIELTS.\nThe IELTS is the International English Language Testing System. This system is from the University of Cambridge, the British Council and IDP Education in Australia. It has one exam for academics or professionals, and one for people who want to live in an English-speaking country. Universities in Britain, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand often want an IELTS exam. IELTS is also becoming popular in North America. The IELTS tests: speaking, listening, writing and reading.\nTOEFL.\nThe TOEFL is a very popular English exam. It is very useful for student who wish to study in the United States of America. TOEFL means \"Test of English as a Foreign Language\". The TOEFL is an academic exam. Many universities in America want a TOEFL exam.\nIn 2005 a new TOEFL was made. The new TOEFL uses Internet. Its name is \"Internet-Based TOEFL\" (iBT). The old TOEFLs did not stop. They are called \"Computer-Based TOEFL\" (CBT) and \"Paper-Based TOEFL\", but are not now available in all countries.\nTOEIC.\nThe TOEIC is a general English exam. TOEIC means \"Test of English for International Communication\". The exam has 200 questions. Every question is a multiple choice question. A multiple-choice question is a question where you choose which answer (e.g. a, b, c or d) is correct.\nThe result of the TOEIC is a number. This number is between 10 and 990. 990 is the best number. The TOEIC number is often used for jobs. Many jobs need a number higher than 600. Managers often need a number higher than 800.\nLCCIEB.\nLCCIEB means \"London Chamber of Commerce and Industry Examinations Board\". The LCCIEB makes many English exams. Many businesses like LCCIEB exams.\nThe EFB means \"English for Business\". The EFB is a business English exam. It tests basic general English. It also tests more difficult business English.\nThe EFC means \"English for Commerce\". The EFC is a business English exam. It tests business writing. It also tests business skills. Business skills are ideas how to manage a business. The EFC is more difficult than the EFB.\nThe PBE means \"Practical Business English\". The PBE is a business English exam. It tests business speaking. It also tests business listening. The PBE is for basic English. People with a PBE can have a basic business conversation.\nThe SEFIC means \"Spoken English for Industry and Commerce\". The SEFIC is a business English exam. It tests business speaking. It is more difficult than the PBE. It tests difficult business speaking. It also tests difficult business listening.\nThe WEFT means \"Written English for Tourism\". The WEFT is an English business exam. It tests business speaking. It tests speaking at hotels. It also tests speaking in other parts of tourism. The WEFT also tests listening.\nBULATS.\nThe BULATS means \"Business Language Testing Service\". The BULATS is a special exams for big companies. The BULATS are made for a company. The BULATS for another company is different.\nPitman.\nPitman exams are made by the City and Guilds Group. There are two important English exams by Pitman.\nThe ESOL means \"English for Speakers of Other Languages\". The ESOL tests English at many levels. The ESOL is good for going to many colleges. The \"Spoken ESOL\" is like the ESOL. But the Spoken ESOL only tests speaking and listening.\nThe EBC means \"English for Business Communications\". The EBS is a business English exam. There are three levels.\nCELS (ARELS/Oxford).\nThe CELS exams are English exams for people who want to study in England. CELS means \"Certificates in Communicative Skills in English\". The CELS exam comes from the old ARELS and Oxford exams; now they are Cambridge ESOL exams. The ARELS exam tests speaking and listening. The Oxford exam tests writing and reading. The new name of Arels and Oxford together is CELS.\nThere are three levels in the CELS exam. \"Preliminary\" is the easiest exam. \"Vantage\" is more difficult. \"Higher\" is the most difficult exam. People who have the CELS are very good at speaking English. These exams are good for universities.\nThis exam is different from some other exams because learners get one certificate (paper saying how good they are) for each part of the exam. A learner can have a high mark on the speaking certificate but a low one in writing, for example.\nCompare exams.\nIt is very difficult to compare English exams. Every exam is a little different.\nIn Europe, the ALTE says how different exams compare. The ALTE is the Association of Language Testers in Europe. It has 28 exam makers in it, and compares their exams in 24 languages. The ALTE says what learners can do at every step of learning. Because of this, they say the ALTE list is a \"can-do\" list. The ALTE list is a simple way to talk about the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEF). The CEF is from the Council of Europe.\nThis table shows what learners \"can do\" in normal English (not for work or studying) at the ALTE steps:\nThis table compares exams in ALTE:\nProfessional organizations.\nThere are many groups of teachers, professors, and other experts that do research on English language testing. Some of these may be have good information to help teachers understand testing better."}

It is like a sales tax that is charged in some US States.\nThe tax is paid every time goods are sold.\nThe tax can be complicated to work out, because every business or person has to charge the tax, and have an to show they have paid some tax. The only person who pays the full amount of tax is the customer of the shop.\nThe government also charges VAT on some services. This is because some companies do not make a thing which can be used (goods) instead they do something to help a customer (that is, provide a service).\nFor example, a garage-owner might sell a spare part for a customer\u2019s car. The garage-owner charges VAT because spare parts are \u201cgoods\u201d. If the garage-owner helps the customer by fitting the spare parts into the car, the garage-owner would charge extra for his time, and would also charge VAT on the amount he charged for the service of fitting the parts.\nVAT is not added to all products. Children's books and clothes do not have VAT."}

It was the most successful animated movie of the 1990s. The movie is about a young lion prince who learns about his role as prince and in the circle of life. It is dedicated to Frank Wells, who was the president of The Walt Disney Company and died shortly before the movie was released into theaters on June 15, 1994. It was the first full-length Disney movie to feature no human characters since \"Bambi\". Much of the voice acting work was done by well-known actors, including Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Rowan Atkinson, and Julie Brown. \"The Lion King\" is a musical; the songs have music by Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice. Computer animation was used a lot when making the movie, like during the song \"Circle of Life\" and others. When they were making it, this movie was thought of as just \"alright\" compared to the movie they were going to make after that, which would be \"Pocahontas\". The studio released the trailer, and found that many people liked it, especially the song \"Circle of Life\"\".\" When it was released, the movie became the most successful movie worldwide (in the United States, \"Forrest Gump\" was most successful of that year) and the most successful animated feature movie of all time until \"Finding Nemo\". Since then, \"Shrek 2\" has become more successful than \"Finding Nemo\", making \"The Lion King\" the third most successful.\nThe movie was also made into an award-winning stage musical. The stage show first opened on September 1, 1997 in New York City, and it was a big success. A version opened later in London, England. Many other shows of \"The Lion King\" have been shown across the world, and is one of the United Kingdom's biggest and most popular shows. It is supposed to be set in Kenya.\nIn 2019, a computer animated live-action remake was released.\nStory.\nIn the fictional opening scene, lots of animals and birds gather at Pride Rock to see Simba, the new prince who has just been born. Simba is the son of Mufasa and Sarabi. Rafiki picks up Simba and lifts him high up so that all of the animals can see. The animals celebrate and rejoice. But Scar, Mufasa's brother, is jealous because Simba will be king instead of him.\nScar lies to Simba about a dangerous place called the Elephant Graveyard. Scar says that only brave lions go there, causing Simba to be interested, even though Mufasa has forbidden Simba from going there. Simba lies to his mother, Sarabi, about going to the Water Hole when he is actually going to the Elephant Graveyard. Simba's best friend Nala and Zazu, the king's messenger, go with Simba. Simba and Nala trick Zazu with the song \"I Just Can't Wait to be King\" and run away from him. Simba and Nala find the Elephant Graveyard but are chased by the three hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Mufasa saves his son and Nala and takes them both home. Mufasa speaks to Simba alone and explains to Simba that being brave is not about looking for danger. He also explains that the great kings of the past look down from the stars and watch over Simba. Scar, in the Elephant Graveyard, is angry with the hyenas because they did not kill Simba. It is revealed that the hyenas are working for Scar during Scar's song \"Be Prepared\".\nThe next day Scar takes Simba into a gorge (long, deep hole in the ground - also known as a \"valley\") where he explains that Mufasa has a wonderful surprise waiting. Scar has actually planned a wildebeest stampede with the hyenas. Simba is trapped in the gorge as the wildebeest run towards him. Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is in trouble and Mufasa rescues his son. Scar then throws Mufasa into the stampede and Mufasa dies. Scar blames Simba for the death of Mufasa and Simba runs away. Scar becomes king and tells everyone that Simba and Mufasa are dead. Simba runs to a desert and collapses. He is rescued by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. Timon and Pumbaa live in the jungle and are very relaxed, which they show in their song \"Hakuna Matata\". Timon and Pumbaa look after Simba until Simba is an adult lion.\nOne day a lioness (female lion) comes to the jungle and tries to kill and eat Pumbaa. Simba fights the lioness because he wants to save Pumbaa's life. While the two lions are fighting Simba finds out that the lioness is his friend Nala. They are very happy to see each other and they fall in love. Nala wants Simba to go home and fight Scar because Scar is a bad king. Simba will not go home because he thinks that he killed Mufasa and he does not want his family to know. Rafiki comes to the jungle and takes Simba to a field. In the sky above the field Mufasa's ghost appears and tells Simba that he must go home because Simba is the right king. After this Simba goes home to Pride Rock. Nala, Timon and Pumbaa follow him. When they get to Pride Rock they find that the land is dry and the animals have gone.\nAt Pride Rock, Simba sees Scar hitting Sarabi. This makes Simba's love for Scar turn to pure hatred and he tries to make Scar step down. Scar does not and makes Simba fall over the edge of Pride Rock. Simba does not fall and holds on to the edge. Scar thinks that he was won so he tells Simba the truth about the death of Mufasa - that Scar actually killed Mufasa. Simba is upset and a big fight happens. The lionesses fight the hyenas and Simba fights Scar. While the fighting is going on lightning hits a dead tree and starts a fire. Simba and Scar battle on top of Pride Rock. Scar does not want to die and lies to Simba that the hyenas are to blame for everything. Another fight happens and Simba throws Scar over the edge. Scar does not die after the fall, but the hyenas attack and kill him the hyenas are angry that Scar blamed them. Rain falls and puts out the fire. Simba walks to the top of Pride Rock and roars. Much later the animals come back. At the end of the movie, Rafiki picks up Kiara, Simba's daughter and Mufasa's granddaughter, and lifts her up high above Pride Rock so the animals below can see.\nVoices.\nSinging voices\nAwards and nominations.\n\"The Lion King\" received many award nominations, including the Academy Award for Best Original Score (by Hans Zimmer) and the Golden Globe award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, both of which it won. The song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" by Elton John and Tim Rice won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe for Best Original Song, the BMI Film Music Award, and the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance Male.\nThese are the awards:\nSequels and spin-offs.\n\"The Lion King\" was so successful that Disney created a sequel called \"\" and a television series called \"The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa\". A second sequel, \"The Lion King 1\u00bd\", was released on December 10, 2004. A preschool series called The Lion Guard is currently airing on Disney Junior.\n\"The Lion King\" had a special edition that was released in IMAX cinemas in 3D.\nControversies.\n\"SEX\".\nIn one scene of the movie it looks as if animators had written the word \"sex\" into some of the frames of animation. However, they wanted to show the letters \"SFX\" (meaning \"special effects\"). In \"The Lion King\" DVD the word has been taken out.\n\"Kimba the White Lion\".\n\"Kimba the White Lion\" is an animated TV show from the 1960s. It was made in Japan by Osamu Tezuka. Some characters and parts of the story in \"The Lion King\" are similar to \"Kimba the White Lion\" but Disney has said that it was not done on purpose.\n\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\".\nIn one scene with Timon and Pumbaa they both sing \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". This has caused disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled \"Mbube\") in 1939. In July 2004, the family went to court, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs (family) reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.\nHidden racism.\nUpon its release, some critics complained that the hyenas in the movie were negative (bad) racial stereotypes of African-American people and Hispanic people. It has been said that \"despicable hyena storm troopers speak...in racially coded accents that take on the nuances of the discourse of a decidedly urban, black, and Latino youth.\" \nHamas' propaganda.\nIn August 2007, the Hamas terrorist group produced an animated propaganda (information) movie that made fun of the style of \"The Lion King\". The programme was shown on their television station, \"Al-Aqsa TV\". Hamas was shown as a lion that chased and killed rats that looked like members of the secular (separate from religion) Fatah group in Gaza. The programme was shown for a short time but was taken off the air for changes."}

He was known as \"chef of kings and king of chefs\", because he cooked for royalty, and is often thought of as the first celebrity chef.\nBiography.\nCar\u00eame was born Paris, but was abandoned in 1792 because his parents were very poor. He worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap Paris cafe in exchange for a room and food. In 1798, he was apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly, a famous \"p\u00e2tissier\" (cake baker) with a shop near the Palais-Royal.\nCar\u00eame gained fame in Paris for his cake centrepieces, which Bailly put in the p\u00e2tisserie window. The centerpieces were sometimes several feet high, and were only made out of foodstuffs such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. He modelled them on temples, pyramids, and ancient ruins which he read about in the books he studied at the French national library (Biblioth\u00e9que Nationale). Some of his sugar works were so strong that court jesters could dance on them to entertain the king.\nCar\u00eame also worked for other people, for example the French diplomat and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, and other members of Parisian high society, including Napoleon. When he worked in the private kitchens he quickly learned about main courses.\nNapoleon was not interested in having fancy food, but he knew of social contacts that were important for diplomats. In 1804, he gave Talleyrand money to buy Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay. When Talleyrand moved there, he took Car\u00eame with him.\nCar\u00eame was set a test by Talleyrand: he had to create a whole year\u2019s worth of menus, without repeating them, and use only food that was in season. Car\u00eame passed the test and finished his training in Talleyrand's kitchens.

This is a single inherited system in present mammals, but it seems to have evolved convergently in pre-mammals more than once. Instead of having many teeth that are frequently replaced, mammals have one set of baby teeth and later one set of adult teeth which fit together precisely. This may help to grind food, and make it easier to digest.\nLactation (milk) and fur, along with other features, also characterize the Mammaliaformes, though these traits are difficult to study in the fossil record. The fossilized remains of \"Castorocauda lutrasimilis\" are an exception to this.\nEvolution of early mammals.\nFossils of Mesozoic proto-mammals were very scarce. There were only 116 in 1979, but this has changed in recent times. There were about 310 in 2007, with an increase in quality so that there are \"at least 18 Mesozoic mammals [with] nearly complete skeletons\".\nEcological niches in the Mesozoic.\nThere is still some truth in the \"small, nocturnal insectivores\" stereotype, but recent finds show that proto-mammals gradually developed a variety of lifestyles. For example:\nThis paints a picture of small-sized mammals being already quite successful and diversified in the Jurassic and early Cretaceous.\nTaxonomy.\nIn some sources Class Mammalia takes the place of Mammaliaformes, and includes all members of that clade."}

Small quantities of it can be found in the central nervous system of many animals. It can also be discovered in wine, beef and small citrus fruits. \nIn the central nervous system, GHB interacts with other neurotransmitters, such as gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). \nMany countries have regulated it as an illegal drug, even though it can be used in medicine. It can be used as an anesthetic, and a sedative. In the past it has been used to treat insomnia and depression. It can also help people who have a problem with alcoholism or cataplexy. In patients with narcolepsy it has been used to treat sleepiness during the day. Athletes have used it to make their performance better.\nThe drug has been used as a recreational drug. This is because it can make a person euphoric. Many countries have made it illegal if it is not used as medicine. Its most common name as an illegal drug is probably liquid Ecstasy. However, ecstasy is a different drug that is unrelated to GHB.\nGHB is naturally produced in the human body's cells. Its chemical structure is similar to that of ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate. As a supplement or drug, it is used most as a salt. GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation. Small amounts of the substance can be found in some beers and wines. \nGHB can cause 'GHB comas'. This is when people faint or become unconscious. This is what causes most deaths.\nUse as an illegal drug.\nGHB is a depressant of the central nervous system. Its effects have been described as similar to those of alcohol or ecstasy. People feel in a good mood. They also lower their inhibitions. If the dose is increased, the symptoms include nausea, drowsiness, breathing problems, amnesia, unconsciousness and death. The effect of GHB lasts between 1.5 and 3 hours, but may be longer. They can be longer if the drug is mixed with alcohol, or a large dosis was taken.\nCertain substances called \"pro-drugs\", are changed to GHB in the stomach. One such drug, is gamma-butyrolactone. Such products are also a problem. Lots of them are used in industrial processes. An example of this are paint strippers. What is fine for use in industry may be bad for humans.\nSome street names, especially when mixed with other substances such as amphetamines, can be Soap, Water, Salty water, Blue water, and Grievous Bodily Harm."}

Its candidates must be members of the Labour Party as well, and stand as \"Labour and Co-operative Party\" candidates.\nThe party today.\nIt is the political part of the wider British co-operative movement, and all members of the party must be members of a co-operative business. Those who want to stand for election must also be members of the Labour Party.\nMost of the party\u2019s money is from grants made by the retail co-operative societies, and from the fee charged for managing the political affairs of Co-operatives UK, formerly known as the Co-operative Union. Local parties are not based on constituencies, but around a major local retail society, which gives most of the money a local Party Council has. The Party council organises local branches to organise local activity and liaise with Constituency Labour Parties. Some Parties exist without Society support, known as voluntary parties.\nAt first the Co-operative Party was mostly concerned with the problems of the co-op movement. Since the 1930s it has become a more mainstream political, but it still wants better recognition and protection for co-operative business, the social economy, and to advance support for co-operatives and co-operation across Europe and the developing world. The party also stands for a sustainable economy and society.\nIn 2005 there were 29 MPs in the Co-operative Parliamentary Group, who are also members of the Parliamentary Labour Party in the British House of Commons, 8 Members of the Scottish Parliament, 4 Members of the Welsh Assembly and 11 Members of the House of Lords, as well as over 700 local councillors. There is also an informal Co-operative Party group in the European Parliament.\nThe election agreement between the Co-operative and Labour Parties means that 30 candidates can stand as \"Labour Co-operative\" candidates, and get money for election expenses from the Co-operative Party. There are many other Labour MPs who are Co-operative Party members but are not sponsored. One of these was Gareth Thomas MP, chair of the Co-operative Party since 2001 and of the Co-operative Congress in 2003, who was invited to join the parliamentary group in 2003. The Party has not registered a logo with the electoral commission for use on ballot papers, as candidates use the Labour Party \"Rose\" logo. Under UK law a party and a logo must be registered if either are to be used on a ballot paper in an election\nThe Party holds an annual conference. The 2006 conference was held in Sheffield in September 2006.\nThe current General Secretary is Michael Stephenson.\nHistory.\nJoint Parliamentary Committee.\nThe \"Joint Parliamentary Committee\" was set up in 1881 by The Co-operative Union. It was not set up to get MPs elected, but to watch over what was happening in parliament, and to lobby sympathetic MPs. The Co-operative Union Annual Congress tried to get a regular party set up but the retail societies would not give any money.\nThe Great War.\nAt the start of the war, the many retail societies in the Co-op movement grew, partly because they were very public about \"anti-profiteering\". Making a large profit in war time was seen as not being patriotic or helping the country. When conscription (men were ordered into the army) was started and food and fuel supplies restricted, the co-op societies began to suffer. The co-ops were started by ordinary workers, but the government distribution committees and draft tribunals were usually run by members of the upper classes and gentry. Co-ops smaller amounts of food to sell, and coop managers were often drafted, whereas business opponents were able to have even clerks declared vital for the war effort. Co-op Societies were also made to pay \"excess profits tax\" even though as co-operatives they made no profits.\nThe 1917 Congress in Swansea decided to set up a Co-operative Party, the decision was passed by 1979 votes to 201.\nCentral Co-operative Parliamentary Representation Committee.\nAn Emergency Political Conference was held on 18 October 1917. As a result, the \"Central Co-operative Parliamentary Representation Committee\" was formed in 1917, with the objective of putting co-operators into the House of Commons. This was soon renamed the Co-operative Party.\nAt first the party put forward its own candidates. The first was H J May, later Secretary of the International Co-operative Alliance. He was unsuccessful at the 1918 Prestwich by-election.\nTen people stood in the 1918 general election. One candidate was elected: Alfred Waterson who became a Member of Parliament for the Kettering seat. Waterson took the Labour whip in Parliament. In 1919, 151 Co-operative Party local councillors. Waterson retired from Parliament in 1922, but four new Co-operative MPs were elected that same year, including A.V. Alexander. All of them took the Labour whip. Six were elected in 1923 and five in 1924.\nHowever, since the 1927 Cheltenham Agreement, the party has had an electoral agreement with the Labour Party, which allows for a limited number of \"Labour Co-operative\" candidates. This means that the parties do not waste resources by opposing each other. The agreement has been changed several times, most recently in 2003. The 2003 agreement was the first between the Labour Party and the Co-operative Party, instead of the Co-operative Societies. After the first formal agreement, nine Labour Co-op MPs were elected at the 1929 general election, and Alexander was made a cabinet minister. However, only one was returned at the 1931 election against the backdrop of a massive defeat for Labour.\nThe rise of the sister party.\nThe Labour party recovered from the bad election of 1931 and was in government during World War II. This helped the Co-operative Party through the formal election links.. In 1945, 23 Labour Co-op MPs were elected and two had high office in the Labour government - Alexander and Alfred Barnes, who had been chair of the Party.\nAfter the war the co-operative movement declined and so did the influence of the Party. By 1983 only eight Labour Co-op MPs were elected. However, in 1997, all 23 candidates won seats in Parliament and, in 2001, only one was defeated, Faye Tinnion who had stood against the Leader of the Conservative Party, William Hague. Gordon Brown is very interested in the co-operative principles of self-help, and this support allowed the co-operative movement to make representations, and sponsor important bills on updating company law, employee share ownership and micro-generation of energy.\nNoted co-op politicians.\nSee and List of Labour Co-operative Members of Parliament for wider lists.\nNicholas Russell, the 6th Earl Russell (and grandson of the philosopher, 3rd Earl Bertrand Russell) is a strong supporter of the Co-operative Party and secretary of its Waltham Forest branch; he is vocal in his call for the abolition of the House of Lords."}

Its job was to build houses for the people living in Bethlehem, which is a city in eastern Pennsylvania.\nThe National Housing Act (1937) was one of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first tries to make better the living conditions of Americans badly affected by the Great Depression of the 1930s. Bethlehem's Housing Authority was one of the first in the nation. Robert Nuemeyer became the Authority's first executive director in 1939. BHA's first board consisted of chairman (and mayor) Robert Pfeifle, Weir Jepson, Merritt Kreidler, Lt. Colonel William Coyle and Andrew W. Litzenberger.\nThe first thing the BHA built was \"low-income public housing\". That means the houses were built for people who did not earn a lot of money, and they were not built to be sold to make money. The new houses were called Pembroke Village. They were on reclaimed farmland in the northeast part of the city. This area was near the border with the boroughs of Freemansburg, Steel City and Bethlehem Township.\nPembroke Village was planned to have 202 houses or apartments, and a community building/office. At about this time, the US entered into World War II. The war meant there was very little building in the US. But Bethlehem Steel's factory was more or less turned over completely toward providing goods for the war effort. Thousands of workers were brought into Bethlehem to help the plant work for 24 hours a day. This meant a lot of houses were needed in the city. The government and the housing authority got extra land and built three communities as \"temporary war housing\". 700 homes for these workers were built at Parkridge, South Terrace and Clearfield. Pembroke Village was hurried to completion and its 202 units were set aside as \"permanent war housing\", meaning that at the end of the war, Pembroke would revert to low-income housing, while the others would be demolished.\nAfter the end of WWII, Bethlehem had another housing crisis. Men were leaving the armed forces and going back home. From about the start of 1946, the population of the United States increased greatly. In Bethlehem the city population increased from 50,000 to 75,000 by 1960.\nThis meant that a lot of affordable housing was needed. The BHA decided to keep the Parkridge, South Terrace and Clearfield units and use them as public housing.\nThe BHA also planned to build another 500 - 600 units next to Pembroke on a former family farm along Pembroke Road. These buildings would increase Bethlehem's public housing stock to more than 1,400 units.\nBy June of 1950, firms had offered to build Fairmount for $962,000.00. By the end of the year, the Marvine Village bid was also approved for $3.9 million. A lot of the Fairmount project was paid for by the State of Pennsylvania. It stayed part of the state's housing inventory until the late 1970s.\nBy 1952, Mr. Nuemeyer became ill and stepped down. He was replaced by Ralph J. Bartholomew, who was a longtime member of the banking community. During Mr. Bartholomew's tenure, the housing authority started an expansion program designed to help the growing needs of the elderly population.\n1960 - 1974.\nIn 1962, BHA showed plans for its first development designed for older people. The \"Robert Pfeifle Homes\", was a 50 unit community in the northeast area. It had ten buildings. \nThey were among the very first of their type in the United States. In the next ten years, the BHA would design and build more public housing for seniors, including the \"Litzenberger House\", the \"Bodder Building\" and the \"Bartholomew Building\" and the \"Monocacy Tower\". BHA www.bha645.com now has some 450 apartments to serve the older adults in need of affordable housing.\nAt around this time, Mr. Bartholomew died and his successor was brought in from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Frank V. Loretti, with a background in labor relations became the BHA's third director.\n1974 - 2003.\nFrank Loretti wanted to modernize the way the authority worked and was organized. He wanted to use computers for the authority's records and other functions. In addition, the board wanted to begin an authority-wide building modernization program.\nDuring this time a plan was formulated to address the authority's aging infrastructure. The war-time era South Terrace, Parkridge and Clearfield projects were demolished. South Terrace and Parkridge were rebuilt between 1985 and 1991 and all other buildings were modernized, using capital fund money, which was made available by the federal government.\nAlso during this period, various management functions were centralized for greater organization and efficiency. The maintenance shops were also centralized within one modern facility in 1978. A Central Supply facility was dedicated in 1977.\nToday.\nThe current executive director is Clara A. Kendy (2004). Today, BHA's challenge is similar to all other housing agencies. Federal subsidy reductions of up to 15% have caused housing authorities to become leaner and to look toward innovation in order to succeed.\nBHA has several new ideas, including homeownership initiatives where the authority connects eligible tenants with opportunities to help them own their own home. One such example is a partnership with Habitat For Humanity. Economic self-sufficiency is a goal that BHA continuously tries to help its residents achieve.\nToday, the Bethlehem Housing Authority manages 1,430 conventional housing units within ten developments serving the city of Bethlehem. In addition, there are nearly 500 Housing Choice Vouchers available for eligible families. HCV was formerly known as \"Section 8\" housing. The authority also has various recreational and social programs for tenants of all ages.\nIn 2007, BHA's new First Tee Golf Learning program received a national merit award, recognizing it as an innovative recreation/learning program for children. During its 70th anniversary in 2009, it proudly broke ground for a brand new community in northeast Bethlehem. The first \"Bayard Homes\" will be rented during the first months of the year (2011)."}

Les Six were a group of six French composers who were friends around the year 1920. They were young at the time, and they shared a lot of ideas about music. The composer Erik Satie called them \"Les Nouveaux Jeunes\", but then a man called Henri Collet called them \"Les Six\" in an article he was writing, and that name was always used for them after that.\nIn their music they tried to be different from Richard Wagner and other composers of Romantic music, and different from Debussy and Ravel who had been writing Impressionistic music. They also wanted to write in a simple way instead of using complicated rhythms such as those of Stravinsky or twelve tone music like Arnold Schoenberg. Many of their pieces were quite short. They liked strong, masculine music, especially jazz. \nThe six composers did not stay together for very long as they soon developed their own personal styles in their compositions.\nAfter 1920.\nIt was really only in 1920 that all six composers were together. They had all been inspired by Jean Cocteau and Eric Satie. By 1921 Louis Durey had already left the group. Les Six continued to be associated with the style of French music from around the 1920s. They still remained friends, and used to visit a bar known as \"La Gaya\" which became \"Le Boeuf sur le Toit\" (The Ox on the Roof): the title of Milhaud's ballet. The group published an album of piano pieces together called \"Album des Six\". Five of the members worked together on the music for Cocteau's work \"Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel\" \nThe name \"The Six\" was a reference to the group of Russian composers who had been known as \"The Five\"."}

He grew up in Montpellier. In 1913, his parents moved to Paris so that he could study at the Paris Conservatoire. He studied with the composer Vincent D'Indy at the Schola Cantorum.\nBy the time he had joined Les Six he had already become a composer with a strong, personal style of writing. His music is often energetic and aggressive.\nAuric wrote ballet music for Diaghilev. When Jean Cocteau started making motion pictures at the beginning of the 1930s Auric began writing film music. He wrote soundtracks for a number of French and British films, and then for Hollywood movies, too. \"The Song from Moulin Rouge\" made it to the hit parade.\nIn 1962, he gave up writing for moving pictures when he became director of the Op\u00e9ra National de Paris and then chairman of SACEM, the French Performing Rights Society.

He was a member of the group of composers called Les Six. His most popular piece of music is an orchestral work called \"Pacific 231\", which imitates the sound of a steam locomotive.\nHis full name was Oscar-Arthur Honegger, but his first name was never used. He studied harmony and violin in Paris until his parents moved to Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, when he studied at the Conservatory there. He then went back to Paris to study with Charles-Marie Widor and Vincent d'Indy. He wrote a ballet \"Le dit des jeux du monde\" in 1918. In 1926 he married Andr\u00e9e Vaurabourg, a pianist and fellow student at the Paris Conservatoire. They often went on tour together, and his wife played the piano parts to his compositions. The couple had one daughter, Pascale, born in 1932. Honegger also had a son, Jean-Claude (1926-2003) whose mother was the singer Claire Croiza.\nIn the early 1920s Honegger became famous with the \"dramatic psalm\" \"Le Roi David\" (\"King David\"), which is still often sung by choirs. He wrote a lot of music between the wars, including the oratorio \"Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher\", one of his best works. It tells the story of Joan of Arc.\nDuring World War II Honegger could not leave Paris. He joined the French Resistance. He continued to write very serious music, including four symphonies (numbers 2-5) and some religious music.\nHonegger loved trains. As a student he had spent some time travelling to Paris twice a week by train from Le Havre. His popular orchestral work \"Pacific 231\" describes a train on the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was an early piece, written in 1923. \nIn 1947 Honegger suffered a severe heart attack, and after that he composed little. A second heart attack caused his death eight years later in Paris. \nHonegger's music is different to that of the other members of Les Six, partly because Honegger liked the Romantic music of Wagner, Strauss and Reger. His music is tonal but with numerous strong dissonances. His musical style was also influenced by the music of Bach."}

He was a member of the group called \"Les Six\". He is one of the most important French composers of the 20th century. He wrote more than 400 compositions. His music is often influenced by jazz and polytonality (music in more than one key at once).\nLife.\nMilhaud's family were Jewish. He grew up in Aix-en-Provence. His father was an almond dealer. When he was very small he often listened to the songs that were being sung by the women who were sorting out the nuts. They were folksongs from the Provence. When he was a young man he liked to go for walks in the Provence country. This was an important part of his life.\nMilhaud's parents liked music. His father was a pianist and often played at local music gatherings. His mother had a nice contralto voice. When he was seven he learned to play the violin. He loved the music of Claude Debussy, whom he met once. \nMilhaud studied in Paris at the Paris Conservatory where he met Arthur Honegger and Germaine Tailleferre who were also to become members of Les Six. He studied composition under Charles-Marie Widor and harmony and counterpoint with Andr\u00e9 G\u00e9dalge. He also studied privately with Vincent d'Indy. He taught himself to play the piano. In Paris he was able to listen to music by a lot of great composers.\nHe was terribly sad when a close friend was killed in World War I. He decided to go to Brazil. He worked there for nearly two years, deciphering codes. He liked the sounds of the jungle. These sounds were to have an impact on his music. The other great influence was jazz, which he heard in 1922 in New York.\nMilhaud returned to France and worked very hard. He often travelled. In 1940 he had to emigrate to the United States because the Nazis were arresting Jewish musicians. In America he gave lectures.\nHis health became poor. He had rheumatoid arthritis for nearly all his adult life, and by 1948 he was in a wheelchair. He still continued to travel, and to teach, for as long as possible. Probably his most famous student was Dave Brubeck.\nIn 1925 Milhaud married his cousin, an actress called Madeleine Milhaud. She often performed speaking parts in her husband's musical works. In his final years, she devoted herself to looking after him. She died in Paris on 17 January 2008 at the age of 105.\nHis works.\nMilhaud's most popular works include \"Le Boeuf sur le Toit\" (ballet), \"La cr\u00e9ation du monde\" (a ballet for small orchestra with solo saxophone, influenced by jazz), \"Scaramouche\" (for Saxophone and Orchestra, also for two pianos), and \"Saudades do Brazil\" (dance suite).

(The unit of energy is the joule and the unit of charge is the coulomb.) Electric potential tells what the electric potential energy of a charged object will be for every coulomb of charge it has, or how many joules of energy there will be per coulomb. The unit for electric potential, joule per coulomb, it is named the volt in memory of Alessandro Volta. One volt equals one joule per coulomb. \nIntroduction.\nA good analogy is water in a mill pond. In a pond, water has gravitational potential energy because of how high it is above sea level. When the water goes over a fall, it loses energy. There might be a pond in the hills with 100 liters of water and 1000 joules of energy in the pond, and so there are 10 joules of energy per liter. Another pond might have 100 liters of water but yet only 500 joules of energy because the pond is in a lower valley. This pond has 5 joules per liter. Similarly, we could have 100 coulombs of charge with 1000 joules of electric potential energy stored somewhere, maybe in an electric circuit. The electric potential would be 10 joules of energy per coulomb. In another place, maybe another place in the same electric circuit, there might be an electric potential of 5 joules per coulomb.\nJust like a mass falls from a place where it has a higher potential energy, an airplane or someplace in the universe, to where it has a lower potential energy, the ground or a different place in the universe, so do charges. Charges will always go to where they have lower electric potential or potential. This going is also called \"falling\". A group of charges or a charged object will fall from where there is an electric potential of 10 joules per coulomb to where there is an electric potential of 5 joules per coulomb, or from a place with an electric potential of 10 volts to one with an electric potential of 5 volts. If there are 20 coulombs of charge on an object, it will fall from having an electric potential energy (EPE) of 200 joules (20 c x (10 j/c) = 200 joules) at the place with an electric potential of 10 volts to an electric potential energy of 100 joules (20 c x (5 j/c) = 100 joules) at the place with an electric potential of 5 volts.\nGravity.\nWhile this concept is also valid for gravity, it is not used. It is almost always more useful to think of and use the total gravitational potential energy, GPE, of an object and not use the GPE per kilogram. In electricity, it is very often more useful to use electric potential, the EPE per charge, instead of using the total electric potential energy.\nElectric potential energy.\nElectric potential is not the same as electric potential energy. It is electric potential energy per unit charge. Electric potential is not the same as electric potential difference. Electric potential difference is also called voltage (see the voltage page).\nRemarks.\nPlease note that the volt and voltage are two different things. The volt is a unit by which we measure something. Both electric potential and voltage are things we measure, and the volt is the unit of measure for both. Yes, a little confusing, but that is the way it is. The symbol for the unit volt is written with a V (9 volts or 9 V). When voltage is used in a formula, the symbol for voltage is a lowercase v. ( e.g. voltage = current x resistance or v = ir) This distinguishes the difference between volts (V) and voltage (v) when there is only a single letter symbol to go by. Electrical engineers use the symbol 'e' for voltage (e.g. e=ir) to distinguish the difference more clearly."}

He was one of the group of six composers who became known as Les Six. He composed music in many different forms: song, chamber music, oratorio, opera, ballet music and orchestral music. His music is easy to enjoy at first hearing: it is much simpler than the music of many other composers who were writing modern music at the time. At first the music critics did not think he was a serious composer, but later people realized the importance of his music. He is the greatest writer of French song (m\u00e9lodie) since Faur\u00e9.\nEarly life.\nPoulenc came from a rich family. His father had a large pharmaceutical business. His mother, an amateur pianist, taught him to play the piano. The Catholic faith was important to him, as well as the artistic life. These two influences shaped his personality. The music critic Claude Rostand said that Poulenc was \"half monk and half naughty boy\".\nPoulenc wanted to study music at the Paris Conservatoire after his school years, but the death of both his parents changed his plans. He had lessons from Ricardo Vi\u00f1es who was a great teacher for him and helped him develop as a person. Poulenc wrote his first compositions for his teacher. He met many famous people including the composers Satie, Auric and Falla and writers such as Apollinaire. He started to get his works performed, and Stravinsky helped him to get them published in London. He continued to compose while he was doing his military service, and became a member of Les Six. These six composers did not all compose in the same way, but they were good friends.\nPoulenc felt that he needed more lessons and he studied with Charles Koechlin. He was asked by Diaghilev to write ballet music for \"Les Biches\". He composed his \"Concerto for Two Pianos\" and the \"Organ Concerto\". He was very upset by the death of Raymonde Linossier who was the only woman he ever wanted to marry. Poulenc was becoming aware that he was gay. He had a lot of emotional problems with big changes of mood.\nHis friendship with the singer Pierre Barnac was a great help to him professionally. Barnac was a baritone. Poulenc composed about 90 songs for him. They gave many concerts together.\nPoulenc spent some periods of his life composing and other periods performing. He made a series of broadcasts on French radio. He composed a great deal of music during the 1950s. He died suddenly of a heart attack in 1963.\nHis music.\nPoulenc was an excellent pianist and he wrote a lot of music for the piano, especially during the 1930s. He liked to create blurred effects by using the sustaining pedal a lot. Some of his best piano writing is in the accompaniment to his songs.\nPoulenc\u2019s early chamber music often uses jazz ideas. He wrote several sonatas for various instruments. He liked writing for wind instruments. His \"Piano Sextet\" is for piano and five wind instruments.\nHe wrote several works for orchestra as well as music for the stage and choral music. His \"Gloria\" is often performed by choirs. Children like his \"Story of Babar the Elephant\". It is for a storyteller and piano. Jean Fran\u00e7aix made an arrangement for an orchestra."}

She was one of the members of the famous group Les Six.\nShe was called Marcelle Taillefesse when she was born. When she was grown up she changed her last name to \"Tailleferre\" just to annoy her father because he had refused to let her study music. She studied piano with her mother at home, composing short works of her own and then began studying at the Paris Conservatoire. There she met Louis Durey, Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, Georges Auric and Arthur Honegger. She won several prizes at the Conservatoire. She often met with her friends who became known as Les Six.\nIn 1923 Tailleferre began to spend a great deal of time with Maurice Ravel at his home in Monfort-L'Amaury. Ravel encouraged her to enter the \"Prix de Rome\" Competition. In 1925, she married Ralph Barton, an American caricaturist, and moved to Manhattan, New York. She stayed in the United States until 1927 when she and her husband returned to France. They divorced shortly afterwards.\nTailleferre wrote many of her most important works during the 1920s, including her 1st Piano Concerto, The Harp Concertino, the Ballets \"Le Marchand d'Oiseaux\" (the most often performed ballet in the repertoire of the Ballets Su\u00e9doises during the 1920s) and \"La Nouvelle Cyth\u00e8re\" which Diaghilev had asked her to write for his ballet company.\nIn the 1930s she composed the Concerto for Two Pianos, Choeurs, Saxophones and Orchestra, the Violin Concerto, the Operas \"Zoula\u00efna\" and \"Le Marin de Bolivar\", and her masterwork, \"La Cantate de Narcisse\", which she wrote with Paul Val\u00e9ry. Her work in film music included \"Le Petit Chose\".\nWhen World War II started she had to escape across Spain to Portugal and from there to America.\nAfter the war, in 1946, she returned to her home in France where she composed a lot more music, much of which was not published until after her death. She was accompanist at a children's music and movement class. She wrote shorter pieces towards the end of her life because her arthritis made writing difficult.\nTailleferre carried on composing until a few weeks before her death in November 1983."}
{"id": "77621", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77621", "title": "Cladistics", "text": "Cladistics is the method of classifying organisms into groups called clades.\nA clade (Greek = branch) is a group of organisms with a common ancestor and all its descendants (and nothing else). Such a clade is monophyletic. The term 'clade' was coined by English biologist Julian Huxley.\nExamples.\nBirds, dinosaurs, crocodiles, and all other descendants (living or extinct) of their most recent common ancestor form a clade. In the terms of biological systematics, a clade is a single branch on the tree of life, a monophyletic group. Biological classification needs such a natural group of organisms to be put together and given a taxonomic name.\nThis brings classification in line with phylogeny (how living things evolved). In cladistics, clades are the only acceptable units.\nSome versions of cladistics have been the subject of controversy.p226\nHistory of cladistics.\nThe term \"clade\" was introduced in 1958 by Julian Huxley, \"cladistic\" by Cain and Harrison in 1960, and \"cladist\" (for an adherent of Hennig's school) by Mayr in 1965. Hennig referred to his own approach as \"phylogenetic systematics\". From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1980s cladistics remained a minority approach to classification.\nIn the 1990s it rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics (traits). At about the same time the development of effective sequence analysis techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and molecular features of organisms as well as to anatomical ones.\nFor some decades in the mid to late twentieth century, a commonly used methodology was numerical taxonomy.p221 This made no attempt to resolve phylogeny, only similarities. The weakness of this approach was that it left out the connection between classification and evolution.\nPhylogenetic nomenclature.\nPhylogenetic nomenclature is a way of giving names to the groups (clades) that have been decided on by cladistic methods. It differs in many ways from Linnaean nomenclature. Critics of phylogenetic nomenclature include Ashlock, Mayr, and Williams.\nMonophyly and paraphyly.\nMonophyly is defined differently in evolutionary biology and cladistics. In evolutionary biology, the term monophyletic refers to a group of organisms descended from its most recent common ancestor. A monophyletic group may include all or only a part of the descendants of the common ancestor. The ancestor may be a taxon of various ranks.\nIn cladistics, by contrast, a monophyletic group is a group consisting of all the inferred descendants of an ancestral species.\nIn cladistics, a group that includes only some of the descendants of the ancestral species is not monophyletic but paraphyletic. The objective of cladistics is to block out monophyletic clades. Therefore, the elements of a paraphyletic group must be rearranged so that they do form one or several clades. Degree of similarity is not a criterion in grouping organisms into clades.\nA distinction.\nCladograms show who's related to what, and evolutionary trees show which evolved from whom."}

The process started about 450 million years ago (mya) and was complete by 210 mya.\nPangaea was the latest of a series of global supercontinents. They formed at various times since plate tectonics began on Earth. Generally Pangaea and Gondwana are considered as parts of the same supercontinent Gondwana-Pangaea.\nFormation.\nThe collisions between continental plates formed the greatest mountain ranges in the history of the Phanerozoic eon. The mountain building included the Caledonian orogeny, the Alleghenian orogeny and the Variscan orogeny. The low mountains of Scotland, Scandinavia and eastern North America are the ground-down remains of these vast events.\nBreak-up.\nThere were three major phases in the break-up of Pangaea. The first signs of rifting came in the Triassic before Pangaea was completely formed.\nPangaea broke up about 180/200 million years ago, in the early middle Jurassic. It broke into supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana before each of these broke into the current continents. One rift resulted in a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean.\nThe second major phase in the break-up of Pangaea began in the Lower Cretaceous (150\u2013140\u00a0Ma), when Gondwana separated into multiple continents (Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia).\nThe third major and final phase of the break-up of Pangaea occurred in the early Cenozoic (Paleocene to Oligocene). Laurasia split when North America (also called Laurentia) broke free from Eurasia, opening the Norwegian Sea about 60\u201355\u00a0Ma. The Atlantic and Indian Oceans continued to expand, closing the Tethys Ocean.\nThe break-up of Pangaea continues today in the Great Rift Valley in East Africa and Arabia."}

The famous Sunni theologian Abu Hanifa an-Nu\u2018man, who developed Hanafi, one of the Sunni Madh'habs (schools of thought) is associated with this region.\nBefore 1976 the province was known as Ramadi; before 1962, it was known as Dulaim.\nPeople.\nMost of the inhabitants are Sunni Muslims from Dulaim tribe.\nGeography of Al Anbar.\nThe Euphrates River flows diagonally from the north to the southeast, passing through six of the eight districts; Al-Qa'im, Anah, Haditha, H\u012bt, Ramadi, Fallujah, Abu Ghraib, Ar Rutba, forms the majority of the Governorate's area, occupying the large desert area in the southwest.\nWeapons in Al Anbar.\nThere are an estimated 20 million weapons in Al Anbar, opposed to an estimated population of 2 million, according to official reports, a ratio of ten firearms for every citizen.\nIt's traditional for Dulaim tribe members to keep a weapons at home.\nThe arms included mortars, surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank shells, rocket-propelled grenades as well as large quantities of mines, explosives and ammunition.\nIraq War events in Al Anbar.\nThe city of Fallujah is also in Anbar. The Iraqi resistance were widely considered to be stronger in this province than in any other in Iraq, and hostility toward Against American forces.\nIn late 2004 to 2007, a series of operations by US forces, was not successful in driving resistance from Anbar. Additionally, in early 2006, several clans\u2014some including resistance groups raids against Americans forces in the area, the increase of sectarian violence in baghdad(that pushed many of the Sunni Dulaimi clans back into alliances with militants) and the continued resistance control of several cities in Anbar showed that fighting in the region was far from over. Reports in March 2006 suggested that the Anbar capital Ramadi had largely fallen under resistance control along with most of the region, as a result the US sent an additional 3,500 Marines to re-establish control of the region.\nThe Iraq war website icasualties has reported that 1,842 Iraqi soldier and 2220 US Soldier and 7542 Mercenary were killed in action in Anbar province between the start of 2004 and the end of February 2006.

{"id": "77687", "revid": "1055293", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77687", "title": "Egg (food)", "text": "Most eggs that are eaten by humans, including bird eggs and turtle eggs, have a protective, oval eggshell, the albumen (egg white), the vitellus (egg yolk), and various thin membranes, that are layers like skin. Every part of the egg is edible, although the eggshell is usually thrown away. Eggs are a good source of protein, choline, and fat-soluble vitamins.\nRoe and caviar are edible eggs produced by fish.\nEgg as a food ingredient.\nBirds' eggs are a common food source. The most commonly used bird eggs are those from the chicken, the duck, and the goose. Smaller eggs such as quail eggs are sometimes used as a gourmet ingredient, as are the largest bird eggs, from ostriches. \nMost of the chicken eggs sold for human consumption are unfertilized. The hens are kept without any roosters. Fertile eggs can be bought and eaten as well. There is no difference in the food value of fertilised and unfertilised eggs. Fertile eggs for eating do not have a baby bird inside. This is because eggs have to be kept cool before they are sold, and the cold stops the young inside from starting to grow.\nChicken eggs are widely used in many types of cooking. Recipes that use eggs include sweet and savoury dishes. Eggs can be used and cooked in many different ways. They can be hard-boiled, soft-boiled, scrambled, fried, combined with flour in cakes or eaten raw. Roasted eggs are used at the Jewish holiday of Passover. Pickled eggs are hard-boiled and then put in vinegar. They are often sold in UK fish and chip shops.\nEating raw eggs is not recommended for some people. This is because the egg may be contaminated with bacteria (like salmonella) that could cause illness. This could be serious for the elderly, the infirm, or pregnant women.\nThe body can use about 91% of the protein of a cooked egg, nearly twice as much as from a raw egg.\nColor.\nThere is no difference in taste or food value between white or brown eggs. The color of a chicken's egg depends on the breed.\nIn most of the United States, eggs are generally white; while in the northeast of that country and in the United Kingdom, eggs are generally light-brown. People in Brazil and Poland prefer brown or reddish eggs, because white eggs are thought of as \"industrial\", that is, for use in commercial bakeries. The reason some people prefer one colour of egg and other people prefer a different colour is probably because of what the colours are linked with in their minds. For example white is linked with purity, and brown-shelled eggs with greater wholesomeness.\nCarotenoids can affect how intense the color of the yolk is."}
