It involves the discovery of new information. Human beings explore even when they have everything they need where they are. They are the only mammal that does this. \nNeanderthals existed for hundreds of thousands of years in Eurasia. But their range was limited compared to modern humans. In less than 500,000 years humans have explored and spread out to all the continents. Exploration had its most dramatic rise during the Age of Discovery. This is when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world. Humans have explored geographically even into outer space. They explore ideas, art, even the very nature of life.\nEarly historic explorations.\nPhoenicians.\nThe Phoenicians were a culture that existed in the coastal region of the Levant as early as the 3rd millennium BC. They were not a significant culture until about 1100 bc. By the 9th century BC the Phoenicians had became the dominant culture in the Mediterranean Sea. They grew wealthy through trade. Instead of war they used trade agreements and alliances to expand their colonies. The Phoenicians developed advanced navigational skills and had the best ships in the Mediterranean. They explored over land routes and developed caravan routes to trade with distant places. Carthage got its start as a Phoenician colony on the north coast of Africa. It grew to be their largest and most successful colony. \nCarthaginians.\nGradually the western Mediterranean Phoenician colonies all came under the control of Carthage. The Carthaginians were explorers too. Two major explorations are are mentioned by early writers. Both took place around 500 BC. Pliny the Elder wrote that Carthage sent an explorer named Himilco to explore the remote parts of Europe. The report, or \"periplus\" (sailing record), has not survived but other early writers have seen it. He had as many as 60 ships in his fleet. He would have traveled along the Iberian Peninsula up the coast of Gaul. Avienus, a Roman writer of the 4th century AD, wrote about the expedition. Himilco moved north from Brittany to the British Isles. It is likely he was looking for tin, a rare metal at the time. He reached a land called , \u201cThe Holy Island\u201d, generally believed to be Ireland.\nAbout the same time, Hanno the Navigator was sent to explore the western coast of Africa. His periplus has survived and is one of the earliest surviving manuscripts. The periplus records landmarks, ports and sailing distance between them. It is a guide for other ship captains to follow. Hanno's 60 ships moved south along the African coast. He may have reached as far as an island off the coast of Sierra Leone. There is no record of any other explorations of the west Africa coast until the time of Henry the Navigator, the Portuguese explorer.\nGreek explorers.\nOne of the first scientific explorers was Pytheas of Massalia. He was an ancient Greek from the then Greek colony of Massalia (now Marseille). He made a voyage to northwestern Europe in about 325 BC. He circumnavigated Great Britain. Pytheas was the first person on record to describe the Midnight Sun. He is the first known scientific visitor and reporter of the Arctic polar ice. His account of the tides is the earliest known to suggest the moon as their cause.\nChinese exploration.\nDuring the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty explored much of the eastern part of the Northern Hemisphere. In 139 BC, the Han diplomat Zhang Qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi. He discovered countries the Chinese did not even know existed. He had traveled as far as the Indus River in northwestern India.\nMedieval explorations.\nVikings.\nDuring the Viking Age Three different groups of Vikings can be identified from different parts of Scandinavia. The Danes, Swedes (also called the \"Rus\") and Norwegian vikings. The 'Rus', founded the settlement of Kiev. Named for themselves they called it Russland (later known as Russia). Swedish Viking explorer Gar\u00f0ar Svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island. About 890 CE Vikings, led by Ohthere of Norway, traveled north above the Arctic Circle to the White Sea. \nAbout 982, the Norwegian Erik the Red explored Greenland. In 986 he returned to Iceland, from where he sailed. He convinced others to follow him and founded the first settlement there. By the year 1000 there were a thousand settlers living there. Erik's second of three sons, Leif Erikson was probably the first European to set foot on North America. He landed at a place he called \"Vinland\".\nMarco Polo.\nMarco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant and explorer. He traveled across Asia during the height of the Mongol Empire. He was one of the first Europeans to explore Eastern Asia. He left Venice at age 17 with his father and uncle. They traveled what later became the Silk Road. They reached Cathay (China) where Marco Polo entered the court of Kublai Khan. He traveled and explored China for 24 years. He brought back ivory, jade, jewels, porcelain and silk. He brought back many other things including noodles from China which the Italians called pasta.\nAge of Discovery.\nThis was a period in European history from the early 15th century to the early 17th century. During this relatively short period of time, the way Europeans saw the world was completely changed. The European powers sent ships around the world to search for new trading routes. They were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and spices. In the process, Europeans discovered new people and lands completely unknown to them. Some of the explorers of this age are:\nModern explorations.\nExploring the universe.\nThere are many reasons humans explore outer space. It was first explored with human eyes. Ancient men mapped the universe they could see. Then came the invention of telescopes. In the mid-20th century man actually began exploring space with rockets and spacecraft. The most important reasons are scientific research and the interest of humans to learn more about the universe. Space exploration has developed new technologies. It has created new products and new industries.\nScientific research.\nIn scientific research, exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research. The other two are description and explanation. The term is commonly used metaphorically. For example, a person may speak of exploring the Internet, exploring sexuality, or concepts one cannot physically explore."}

She was the mother of Edward VIII later Duke of Windsor George VI and grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth II Queen of the United Kingdom and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. \nBy birth, Mary was a member of the House of Teck in Berlin, Germany, and through her mother, she was a distant member of the British Royal Family. Within her family, she was given the nickname \"May\" after the month of her birth.\nBirth.\nPrincess Mary was born at Kensington Palace in London on 26 May 1867. Her mother was Princess Mary Adelaide, a daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and a granddaughter of King George III and first cousin of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Her father was Francis, Duke of Teck. Due to her parent's financial troubles, Princess Mary spent much of her early life abroad in order to economize, the Tecks returned to London in 1883, living at White Lodge in Richmond Park.\nMarriage.\nIn 1891, Princess Mary, who was liked by Queen Victoria, became engaged to her double second cousin once removed Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Prince Albert Victor was the heir to the throne after his father, bringing Princess Mary and her family to the senior end of the Royal Family. However, a few weeks before the wedding, Prince Albert Victor died of influenza. Nevertheless, Queen Victoria still favored Mary as a royal bride and therefore arranged for her to marry Albert Victor's brother, Prince George, created Duke of York. They were married at St. James's Palace, London, on 6 July 1893. \nPrincess Mary was devoted to her children and to her public duties. She left her children in the care of a nanny, Charlotte \"Lalla\" Bill, and taught her children history and music. With her public duties, she was equally devoted, becoming Patron of a number of charities. When her father-in-law became King Edward VII, Prince George and Princess Mary undertook an eight-month tour of the British Empire. No royal had undertaken such a big tour before. Princess Mary broke down in tears at the thought of leaving her children, though they were in the care of their doting grandparents. \nIn 1910, Edward VII died, and Prince George ascended the throne as George V. Mary thus became Queen. During the First World War, Queen Mary was criticized for her German heritage. The conflict with Germany forced George V to change the name of the Royal House from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also stripped all titles from those members of the Royal Family who fought for Germany. Following the war, Queen Mary continued her public duties and suffered a family tragedy when she lost her youngest son, Prince John. In 1935, King George celebrated his Silver Jubilee, commemorating 25 years of his reign, and Queen Mary accompanied him during the official tours and visits that took place. Queen Mary used her extensive knowledge of history and royal protocol to advise and support her husband on matters of state.\nIn the 1930s.\nIn 1936, King George V died. His death was shortened by an injection of morphine and cocaine, administered by his doctor. Queen Mary supported her son, now King Edward VIII, during his reign. In December, however, the King abdicated the throne because he wished to marry a divorced American commoner, Wallis Simpson. \nThis put his brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, in his place as King George VI. King George VI was shy and was at first reluctant to take on his new duties and responsibilities. Queen Mary and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, supported him in his new role. The former King Edward VIII became the Duke of Windsor, went to live in Paris, and had a cool relationship with his family in England. No member of the family attended his wedding to Wallis in 1937, and she was never received by Queen Mary. \nSince WWII.\nDuring the Second World War, Queen Mary lived at Badminton House, owned by her niece's husband, the Duke of Beaufort. She continued her duties and supported the war effort. Following the war, she returned to her pre-war home, Marlborough House. She continued her public duties in old age, surviving to see her granddaughter, Elizabeth, ascend the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. After suffering from lung cancer (described publicly as \"gastric problems\"), Queen Mary died of the disease at Marlborough House on 24 March 1953. She lay in state at Westminster Hall before being buried beside her husband at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. She survived her husband by 17 years and outlive three of her children, Prince John of the United Kingdom and Prince George Duke of Kent and King George VI."}

Queen Victoria used the house as a retreat away from public life. She died there on 22 January 1901, and her son, King Edward VII, gave the house to the nation. It was used as a naval training school, and then a convalescent home for officers.

Other royal palaces are no longer residences (e.g. the Palace of Westminster, the Palace of Whitehall). Some remain in irregular use for royal occasions. The Royal Palaces enjoy certain legal privileges, for example there is an exemption from levying duty on alcoholic beverages sold in the bars at the Palace of Westminster and there are exemptions from Health and Safety legislation.\nThe occupied royal residences of are cared for and maintained by the Royal Household Property Section. The unoccupied royal palaces of England are now within the responsibility of the Historic Royal Palaces Agency."}

The game is similar to those in the Cross and Circle family (the category that includes Pachisi). The game is described as a \"random thinking\" one: the moves depend on the roll of the dice but players must consider possible strategies before executing their move. The objective of the game is to advance all the pieces to the end.\nColombian origin.\nParqu\u00e9s is the Colombian version of Pachisi, which originated in India. Although it could be argued that the game comes from Spain (exactly as a derivation from Parch\u00eds) due to the similarity between both games, there is wide agreement in Colombia that the game is completely Colombian. Parqu\u00e9s stems directly from Pachisi in the same way as Parcheesi, Parch\u00eds or Ludo. There is no proof to the claim that it stems from a country other than India. Moreover, no Parqu\u00e9s game is played in any other Latin American countries, neither the world.\nParqu\u00e9s is a mixture of the original Indian game and the influences of local Colombian culture. Other Colombian variations also exist.\nIn Colombia, people from all parts of the country play the game; it is very popular, played by both children and adults. Adults usually play the game by betting money on the first piece, on capturing pieces, or on winning the game, to make gameplay more interesting. There are boards for 4, 6 and 8 players. The boards usually contain pictures of soccer teams, singers, actors, or other cultural figures on the jail boxes.\nThe board itself is usually placed on a box covered by glass. The use of glass is to allow dice to be thrown more easily. There are versions of the board that are made from paper to make it portable.\nGameplay.\nParqu\u00e9s is played with two dice; two to eight players can compete in the same match, depending on what type of game board is used. Each player is given four pieces and uses a specific colour. The most common colours are red, blue, yellow and green, usually arranged in that order. The game can also be played with fewer than four pieces\nThe jail box is where the pieces are placed at the beginning of the match and is where they go whenever an opponent \"captures\" them. The player throws the dice three times and attempts to get a pair in order to \"free\" the pieces. Rolling different pairs or \"doubles\" allows more pieces to be \"freed\": \nWhen the pieces are freed, they are placed in a special box next to the jail. This box is called \"Home\", or \"Salida\" (literally, \"exit\" in Spanish). \nIf a player does not roll any pairs during his turn, he passes the dice to the player on his right. Otherwise, he frees the pieces and wins an extra turn to move them. He throws again and must move the values of the dice with his pieces. \nFor example:\nThe player rolls 5-3\nAfter he makes his move, he must pass his turn to the player on the right.\nThe pieces cannot advance backwards and they cannot be in any of the four boxes before their \"Home\" box. \nThrows and turns.\nEach player can throw the dice once. There are some exceptions to this rule:\nCapturing pieces.\nThe player can capture an opponent\u2019s piece by placing his own piece on the same box as the other player\u2019s piece. However, he cannot capture a piece that is on a SAFE or a HOME box. Capturing in Colombia is called \u201ceating\u201d (\u201ccomer\u201d in Spanish).\nHowever, the player can capture pieces on his HOME box. When he frees any piece from jail, the pieces placed on his HOME are captured, that is, sent to its jail, losing all their advances.\nThe player can avoid capturing the piece. On that case, an opponent has to accuse him and the piece that did not capture must go to jail. If nobody notices, nothing happens.\nSpecial boxes.\nThere are three types of special boxes."}

He played as a defender.\nLife and career.\nClub career.\nMcNeill was born in Bellshill. He played for nearby club Blantyre Victoria before signing for Celtic in 1957. During his playing career at Celtic, McNeill was the captain of the clubs most successful sides of the 1960s and 1970s. In his 18 seasons at the club, Celtic won many honours. This totalled nine league titles, seven Scottish Cups, six Scottish League Cups and one European Cup. In the 1966\u201367 season, Celtic won the European Cup Final against Inter Milan, with McNeill as captain. This was the first European Cup won by a British side, and the only to date won by a Scottish side. Celtic again made the European Cup Final in 1970. However, McNeill's side lost to Feyenoord.\nMcNeill played all of his senior games for Celtic. This makes him the Celtic player with the most games played for the club at 822. He retired from playing in 1975.\nInternational career.\nMcNeill played for Scotland between 1961 and 1972. In the 29 games played for his country, he scored three goals.\nManagement.\nSoon after retirement from playing, McNeill became a football manager. For a short time, he managed Clyde. He left Clyde after a short time for Aberdeen. He finished as a runner-up in the league and Scottish Cup with Aberdeen. Celtic manager Jock Stein left the club in 1978. McNeill soon became Celtic's manager. As Celtic manager between 1978 and 1983, he won three league titles, a Scottish Cup and a Scottish League Cup. He would go on to manage English sides Manchester City (1983\u201386) and Aston Villa (1986\u201387).\nMcNeill returned to manage Celtic in 1987. In his first season in his second stint, Celtic won the league and Cup double. The next season, 1988\u201389, the side won another Scottish Cup. However, the next two seasons saw no trophies won at Celtic and McNeill was sacked in May 1991. He never returned to full management but was caretaker manager at Hibernian for a short time in 1998.\nPersonal life and death.\nMcNeill was awarded an MBE in 1974. He also wrote three books, \"For Celtic and Scotland\" (1966), \"Back to Paradise\" (1988) and \"Hail Cesar\" (2004).\nIn February 2017, McNeill's family said that he had been living with dementia for many years.

By this, a worker tells the others where it has found nectar. This was shown by the Austrian ethologist Karl von Frisch.\nThe dance is a type of communication for bees. It is done to give other bees information about the direction and distance to flowers that have nectar or pollen, or both. It is also used to tell the bees where water can be found.\nThe dance is used for bees to get others to help them collect resources for the hive. It used to be thought that bees have two distinct \"recruitment\" dances. There were the \"round dances\" and waggle dances. Round dances were thought to be used for things that were close by and wiggle dances were for things farther away. It is now known that a round dance is only a waggle dance with a very short \"waggle run\" (see below).\nDescription.\nA waggle dance is made up of one to 100 or more circuits. Each circuit has two phases. These phases are the waggle phase and the return phase. When a bee returns to the hive after finding a good food source, it performs the dance. The bee will run through a small wave-like pattern (a waggle run or waggle phase). After this, it will turn to the right and circle back to the starting point (the return phase). It will then do another waggle run and then turn to the left and circle back to the beginning. The waggle phase of the dance is the most notable and informative part of the dance.\nThe direction and duration of waggle runs show the direction and distance to flowers. Flowers that are located directly in line with the sun are shown by waggle runs in an upward direction on the vertical combs. If the flowers are at an angle to the right or left of the sun, the waggle run is done at the same angle to the upward direction. The distance between hive and flowers is shown in the duration of the waggle runs. The farther the flowers are from the hive, the longer the waggle phase. For every 100 meters the flowers are distant from the hive, the waggle phase lasts about 75 milliseconds.\nApplications to operations research.\nPeople study the swarm intelligence of social insects and animals such as fish, birds, and ants. Recently, there has been research on using bee waggle dance behavior for fault-tolerant routing. From the abstract of Wedde, Farooq, and Zhang (2004)\nAnother technique based on bees is called bee colony optimization. It is used help Internet servers communicate better."}

He has become known for what he wrote and said on the Informal economy and property rights.\nIn 2020, he announced his candidacy for President of Peru for the 2021 general election. He ultimately placed fourth in an atomized race of 18 nominees. \nMain ideas.\nPrivate ownership is needed.\nIn his books, de Soto says that an economy cannot go past the stage of a subsistence economy if there is not a formal system of owning property (land or goods). Developing countries have \"informal ownership\" since no formal certificate says that land or goods really belong to a certain person.\nDe Soto thinks the capitalist economies of the United States developed because they had a clear system of owning property. For the United States, the formal system of owning property came from it being a colony of England. Japan's formal system came after the Second World War.\nBecause formal ownership systems do not exist in developing countries, the poor people in these nations cannot develop. They cannot use their land as a guarantee to the bank to get money to build something, for example. De Soto argues that this is the basis for enterpreneurship. In much of the developing world,famers therefore are left with subsistence agriculture. As such, he argues that this informal ownership should be made formal, for example by giving squatters in shanty towns land titles to the land they now live on.\nGovernment bureaucracy is bad for the economy.\nDe Soto also argues that government bureaucracy greatly hinders the ability for people to hold private property, for example:\nThus entrepreneurs are driven to form \"underground\" economies, but de Soto points out the serious disadvantages:\nThomas Sowell's review of his book.\nThomas Sowell writes:"}

He lead the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States and was probably the first European to discover the Mississippi River.\nThe expedition was looking for gold and for a way to China. They explored the southern United States. De Soto died in 1542 on the banks of the Mississippi River at present-day Lake Village, Arkansas. Hernando de Soto was born to parents who were hidalgos in Extremadura, a region of poverty and hardship from which many young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere. His parents were poor, too. Two towns, Badajoz and Jerez de los Caballeros, claim to be his birthplace. All that is known with certainty is that he spent time as a child at both places. In his will, he wanted to be buried at Jerez de los Caballeros, where other members of his family were also buried. The age of the Conquerors came on the heels of the Spanish reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from Islamic forces. Spain and Portugal were filled with young men begging for a chance to find military fame after the Moors were defeated. With discovery of new lands to the West (which seemed at the time to be far East Asia), the whispers of glory and wealth were too compelling for the poor.\nDe Soto sailed to the New World in 1514 with the first Governor of Panama, Pedrarias D\u00e1vila. Brave leadership, unwavering loyalty, and clever schemes for the extortion of native villages for their captured chiefs, became De Soto's hallmark during the Conquest of Central America. He gained fame as an excellent horseman, fighter, and tactician, but was notorious for the extreme brutality with which he wielded these gifts.\nDuring that time, Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, who discovered Florida, Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa, who discovered the Pacific (he called it the \"South Sea\" below Panama), and Ferdinand Magellan, who first sailed that ocean to the Orient, profoundly influenced de Soto's ambitions."}

There are about 10 species, all native to Europe, Asia, and North America.\nThe flowers are small and single-sex (monoecious), the female flowers are carried in pairs, the male flowers are wind-pollinating catkins, produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The bark is smooth and light grey. The fruit is a small, sharply three\u2013anglend nut 10\u201315\u00a0mm long. The nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as acorns). They have a high tannin content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.\nBeech grows on a wide range of soil types, acid or basic, provided they are not wet for long periods. The tree canopy casts a heavy shade, and the leaves, when dropped, cover the ground thickly. Few plant grow under beech trees.\nIn North America, they often form Beech-Maple forests by growing together with the Sugar Maple.\nUses of Beechwood.\nThe beech has been used for its wood by man for thousands of years. The wood is white, or reddish if grown on acid soil, but fine grained, smooth and heavy when first cut. It may split as it dries. It is a good wood for making ornaments, tool handles, kitchen utensils, furniture and parts of buildings. Beechwood burns well and is used, among other woods, to smoke herrings in Scotland. It can also be made into charcoal.\nSouthern Beech.\nThe southern beeches \"Nothofagus\" previously thought closely related to beeches, are now treated as members of a separate family, Nothofagaceae. They are found in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Argentina and Chile (mostly on the southern tip in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego).\nPests and Diseases.\nThe beech blight aphid (\"Grylloprociphilus imbricator\") is a common pest of beech trees.

The pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes.\nIn flowering plants.\nDevelopment of pollen grains.\nThe anther contains microsporangia. Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells. These undergo meiosis, and produce pollen grains, which produce the male gametes (sperm).\nThe pollen is released by the opening of the anther. The pollen is carried by some agent (wind, or some animal) to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same or another flower. This process is known as pollination. After successful pollination, the pollen grain (immature microgametophyte) completes its development by growing a \"pollen tube\" and undergoing mitosis to produce two male gametes.\nPollination.\nThere are two main kinds of pollination. One kind happens when pollen from a stamen sticks to the pistil of the same plant. That is self-pollination.\nThe other kind of pollination takes place when pollen from one plant travels to the pistil of another plant. Most plants use this kind of pollination. Plants need help for this kind of pollination, because they cannot move. So, they need another way to move pollen from one plant to another plant.\nThe wind helps move pollen between plants. The pollen of some plants is very light. Wind blows it from the flowers on one plant to the flowers on another plant. The wind can move pollen a long way before the pollen hits the sticky top of a pistil.\nAnimals also help move pollen between plants. Many flowers are colourful and their scent attracts some animals. These flowers also make a sweet juice called nectar. Sometimes an animal, such as a bee, sees or smells a flower. Then, it lands on the flower to get nectar. As the bee drinks the nectar, the stamens brush pollen onto its body. Then, the bee flies to another flower that has a pistil. The pollen on the bee's body brushes onto the sticky top of the flower's pistil. The pollen is used as protein for the bee larvae.\nThe plants help feed the animal. In return, the animal helps the plants by moving pollen from flower to flower. The relationship has evolved together; it is a kind of co-evolution called mutualism or symbiosis."}

Bolt action rifles are usually the most accurate type of small arms, leading them to be used widely as marksman rifles. The rifle won't cycle a round without the shooter doing it manually, causing less movement of parts and gases while the round is being fired. This improves accuracy, but also increases recoil compared to automatic rifles of the same caliber.\nDespite being significantly slower to fire than lever-action rifles, which were invented around the same time, militaries across the world chose to replace their muzzleloader muskets with bolt action guns rather than lever action ones, because bolt action rifles are loaded over the barrel. This allows easier loading by a shooter lying on the ground, without affecting aim. With lever action guns, on the other hand, the ground is in the way of loading downwards, and to load the gun would mean to throw off the shooter's aim since the gun must be turned sideways.\nFamous bolt action rifles include the Springfield M1903, the G98, the Lee-Enfield, and the Mosin-Nagant."}

The U.S. Army, Army Air Forces, and Navy all adopted it immediately. \nThe Browning .50 caliber machine gun has been used as a vehicle weapon and for aircraft by the United States from the 1920s to the present day.

He was born in Long Beach, California.\nBiography.\nEarly life (1970-1991).\nZack was interested in punk rock- including bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash- from a young age. In seventh grade, Zack played guitar in a punk band called Juvenile Expression, along with his friend Tim Commerford, who played bass. As a teenager, Zack grew to like hardcore punk bands such as Minor Threat and Fugazi, and joined Hardstance as a guitarist. In 1988, Hardstance changed it's name to Inside Out, and Zack became vocalist. Inside Out broke up in 1991. In August of that year, while performing in a club, Zack was approached by Los Angeles local musicians Tom Morello, a guitarist, and Brad Wilk, a drummer and the three agreed to form a band called Rage Against the Machine, which was the name of a song Zack had written when he was vocalist. De la Rocha asked former Juvenile Expression bandmate Tim Commerford to play bass, and he agreed.\nAs a teenager, de la Rocha became a vegetarian for ethical reasons\nRage Against the Machine (1991-2000: 2007-present).\nZack wrote most of Rage Against the Machine's songs, with lyrics that talked about politics and current events.

Zack left the band in October, 2000 for \"political and creative differences\".

These things are heat, fuel, and oxygen. If one of these three is removed, the fire will be put out. In the middle of the fire triangle there is also a chemical reaction.\nWithout heat, a fire cannot begin. If fire becomes cool enough, it will not keep burning. Heat can be removed by using water. This only works on some types of fire. Separating burning fuels from each other can also reduce the heat. In forest fires, burning logs are separated and placed into safe areas where there is no other fuel. Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the heat source, but other fuels may have caught fire. They will continue burning until the firefighters deal with them and their fire triangles. Without oxygen, a fire can not start. Oxygen may be removed from a fire by covering it in some way. Some foams and heavy gases (for example, carbon dioxide) are often used for this. The fire can also be closed off away from a source of oxygen. Once all the oxygen in the closed off area is used by the fire, it will go out if it cannot get more oxygen because it needs oxygen."}

Antioxidants donate one of their electrons or hydrogen to free radicals, stopping their chain reaction. Found in our diet (for example, in vitamins) or formed inside our body (like enzymes), antioxidants can protect us from the damaging effects of free radicals.\nThe best way to combat free radicals is to have a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, red wine, and green tea.

{"id": "132669", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132669", "title": "Coen brothers", "text": "Joel David Coen and Ethan Jesse Coen are movie directors, producers and screenwriters. They are brothers and always work together. They have won many awards including the Academy Award \"(Oscar)\" four times and the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival. Their movies are different genres. They sometimes make movies that are funny like \"Raising Arizona\" or movies with a lot of violence like \"No Country for Old Men\". They can also mix both styles like, for example in \"Fargo\".\nThey write, direct and produce their movies and they share the credits. People sometimes call them \"A two-headed director\" because when actors who work in their movies have a question they can ask either Joel or Ethan and get the same answer.\nBiography.\nJoel was born on November 29, 1954 and Ethan on September 21, 1957 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota near Minneapolis in the United States. Their parents were teachers, their father taught economy and their mother art history. Joel bought a camera and with it they started making new versions of the movies they saw on television.\nWhen they finished high school, Joel studied movie at Bard College at Simon's Rock in Massachusetts and Ethan studied philosophy at Princeton University.\nPersonal life.\nThey are married. Joel married actress Frances McDormand in 1984 (she has acted in six of their movies). Ethan is married to Tricia Cook who edits their movies. They live in New York with their families.\nCareer.\nTheir first movie, \"Blood Simple\" (1984), follows the story of a bar-owner who asks a detective to murder his wife and her lover. The Cohens directed, but only Joel appears in the credits and he accepted awards at Sundance and Independent Spirit.\nThey wrote the screenplay for the Sam Raimi movie, \"Crimewave\" in 1985.\nIn 1987 they wrote and directed \"Raising Arizona\". The movie is about a couple that cannot have babies and decides to steal one. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter played the married couple. The movie was not very successful and it did not make a lot of money in the box offices but many people consider it a cult movie (a movie that has a relatively small number of fans who constantly repeat lines from the dialogs, buy or create merchandise and gather to comment on it).\nTheir next movie was \"Miller's Crossing\". It is about gangsters and was made in 1990.\nAfter \"Miller's Crossing\", \"Raising Arizona\" and \"Blood Simple\", the brothers received good comments on their movies and their directing style as well as the dialogs in their movies. It was not until they made \"Barton Fink\" in 1991 that the brothers achieved international fame. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards. It won three awards at Cannes International Film Festival (the Palme d'Or, best director, and best actor). The story is about a playwright (a person who writes plays) whose name is Barton Fink and he moves to Los Angeles to write movies. Fink is played by John Turturro.\nAfter \"Barton Fink\"'s success, the brothers had the chance to make a big-budget movie (with more money than the previous ones). That movie was \"The Hudsucker Proxy\". The story talks about a man who is given the opportunity to be the director of a big company because the other people in the company (the board) want to buy it at a low price so they intend to have him ruin it. Instead of ruining the company, the man invents the hula hoop and becomes famous.\nThe Coens had 25 million dollars to make this movie but it only earned 3 million so it is considered a commercial failure (not successful). The critics said the movie was not good because it had nothing new to offer the viewers.\nThe brothers made another movie in 1996 with a little money. The name was \"Fargo\". It was universally praised (almost everybody said it was good). They returned to Minnesota because the story takes place there and in North Dakota. The story is about a man who needs money to start his own business so he pays other men to kidnap his wife and plans to ask his rich father-in-law for the ransom (money given in exchange for the woman). Everything goes wrong and a series of violent events starts.\nExperts say the movie was very good because of the dialog used by the actors (they used different accents) and Frances McDormand's performance (acting). She won the Best Actress Oscar. The brothers also won Best Original Screenplay and the Palme d'Or for Best Directing for a second time.\nBy 1998 they were famous for their style and talent and they made another movie \"The Big Lebowski\", a comedy about a man who does not work and spends his time bowling. The man's name is Jeffrey Lebowski so some guys mistake him for a millionaire who has the same name. Fans of the movie consider it a cult movie.\nInspired by parts of Homer's Odyssey, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000), received wide critical acclaim.\nIn 2001 they created \"The Man Who Wasn't There\". The movie is supposed to be in 1940's in California.\nIn 2003 they directed \"Intolerable Cruelty\". It is their most mainstream movie (the movie that is closest to the most common or popular genres). The leading roles are played by George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\nThey worked with Tom Hanks in \"The Ladykillers\" in 2004. A previous version had been made before (not by the brothers) in 1955.\n\"No Country for Old Men\" came out in 2007. The movie is based on the book with the same name written by Corman McCarthy.\n\"A Serious Man\", set in the 1960s in the suburbs of Minneapolis, came out in 2009.\nAwards.\nAcademy Awards.\nThe Coen brothers are two of only seven directors with three Oscars for the same movie.\n1991: \"Barton Fink\"\n1996: \"Fargo\"\n2000: \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n2001: \"The Man Who Wasn't There\"\n2007: \"No Country for Old Men\"\n2009: \"A Serious Man\"\n2010: \"True Grit\"\nBAFTA Awards.\n1996: \"Fargo\"\n2000: \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n2001: \"The Man Who Wasn't There\"\n2007: \"No Country for Old Men\"\n2008: \"Burn After Reading\"\n2009: \"A Serious Man\"\n2010: \"True Grit\"\nBerlin Film Festival.\n1998: The Big Lebowski\nCannes Film Festival.\n1991: \"Barton Fink\"\n1994: \"The Hudsucker Proxy\"\n1996: \"Fargo\"\n2000: \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n2001: \"The Man Who Wasn't There\"\n2004: \"The Ladykillers\"\n2007: \"No Country for Old Men\""}

It was first published in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine on June 20, 1890. Later, Wilde was asked to edit this version, and it was published again in April 1891. The story is often incorrectly called \"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\".\nPlot.\n\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is about a young man named Dorian Gray who has a portrait painted of himself. The artist, Basil Hallward, thinks Dorian Gray is very beautiful, and becomes obsessed with Dorian. One day in Basil's garden, Dorian Gray meets a man named Lord Henry Wotton. Lord Henry Wotton makes Dorian Gray believe that the only thing important in life is beauty. However, Dorian realizes that he will become less beautiful as he grows older. He wishes the portrait Basil painted would become old in his place. Dorian then sells his soul so he can be beautiful forever, but not on purpose.\nDorian's wish comes true. However, every time Dorian does something evil, mean, or selfish, his picture ages. For 18 years, Dorian does not age. He does many bad things, while his portrait becomes more aged with each bad deed. Later on, Dorian decides to stop doing bad things in the hopes that this will make his portrait become beautiful again, but it only makes it worse. Dorian thinks that only a full confession will make the portrait beautiful again. However, he does not feel guilty for anything he has done. So Dorian picks up a knife and destroys the portrait.\nWhen his servants hear a scream from the room Dorian is in, they call the police. The police find Dorian's body on the floor with a stab wound in his heart. His body has become very aged. However, the portrait has returned to the way it was when it was first painted."}

His best known plays are \"All My Sons\", \"Death of a Salesman\" and \"The Crucible\". He also wrote for the movie \"The Misfits\" while married to Marilyn Monroe. She acted in this movie.\nEarly life.\nArthur Miller's family was a rich Jewish family from New York City. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, his family's business was forced to close down and they lost all their money. Because Miller wanted to go to university, he had to work in a warehouse. He studied economics and history at the University of Michigan as well as working for the school newspaper which helped him learn how to write plays. He married Mary Slattery in 1940.\nInfluence on his writing.\nIn Miller\u2019s childhood, his family had money issues. Due to the fact that he experienced the whole situation with his family, his writings have been influenced a lot, he often includes the theme of financial problems which is a result of everything he had seen as a child. Another thing that influenced him a lot was Greek literature. Miller once said that he liked to read Greek literature for ideas to write about. The readers are able to see it in his writing style and the element he uses in his writing.\nPlays.\nIn 1936 his very first play, \"No Villain,\" was produced and gained a huge success. The play even won him a Hopwood Award and people started to get to know him. In 1944, Miller had his first play in the theater on Broadway in New York City, called \"The Man Who Had All the Luck\". Not many people liked it so this play was stopped after one week. However, three years later, his play \"All My Sons\" became very popular. This play won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. In 1949, he wrote \"Death of a Salesman\", a story about the American Dream, it addresses the loss of identity and a man who's unable to accept change within himself and society. In 1953, he wrote \"The Crucible\", a story about the Salem Witch Trials. He wrote this because of the McCarthyism of the 1950s, the fear that communism would take over America. A few years later, Miller was blamed for being a communist himself. He had to answer questions from the House Un-American Activities Committee, a group that Senator Joseph McCarthy made.\nPersonal life and death.\nMiller was an atheist.\nIn 1956, Miller divorced Mary Slattery so he could marry the actress Marilyn Monroe. During this marriage, he wrote for the movie \"The Misfits\". Monroe acted in this movie. After five years of marriage, Monroe divorced him.\nThe following year, Miller married again. The photographer Inge Morath was his third wife, and they were together until she died in 2002. They had two children.\nHis son, Daniel, was born with Down Syndrome. Miller put him in a hospital and did not want to see him again. His daughter, Rebecca, who married actor Daniel Day-Lewis, asked Miller several times to contact his hospitalised son.\nIn 1964, Miller produced the play \"After The Fall\" that talks about the marriage with Marilyn Monroe. Later on, during the mid 1990s, he wrote three new plays, including \"The Ride Down Mt. Morgan\", \"The Last Yankee\" and \"Broken Glasses\".\nOn February 10, 2005, Miller died of heart disease. He was 89.\nInfluence on society.\nMiller's ideas influence the society a lot. For example, the way of writing has changed a lot. He often writes about the experience of being human in a very raw but very loving way. He once said that \u201cMaybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets\u201d which later on has a huge impact on people. Another influence on society is that the way people write stage plays have changed a lot. People tend to focus on characters more than anything else. Miller believes that \u201cthe theater is so endlessly fascinating because it's so accidental (happens by chance). It's so much like life.\u201d It reflects on his writing because he likes to write more on the bonds between individual and society rather than only character."}

In Siamangs, two fingers on each hand are fused together, that's where the name \"syndactylus\" is from. Siamangs have large \"gular sacs\". These can be found in both males and females. The gular sac is a throat pouch that can be inflated to the size of its head. This allows the Siamang to make loud resonating calls or songs.\nThere may be two subspecies of the Siamang. If so, they are the nominate Sumatran Siamang (\"S. s. syndactylus\") and the Malaysian Siamang (\"S. s. continentis\", in peninsular Malaysia). Otherwise, the Malaysian individuals are only a population. The Siamang is the only gibbon which occurs sympatrically with other gibbons; its two ranges are entirely within the combined ranges of the Agile Gibbon and the Lar Gibbon.\nThe Siamang can live over 30 years in captivity.\nWhile the illegal buying and selling of pets takes a toll on wild populations, the main threat to the Siamang is habitat loss in both Malaysia and Sumatra. Palm oil production is clearing lots of forest, reducing the habitat of the Siamang, along with that of other species such as the Sumatran Tiger."}

He is probably more famous by his pen name Jeremias Gotthelf. He was born in Murten, where his father was pastor.\nIn 1804 the home was moved to Utzenstorf, a village in the Bernese Emmental. Bitzius gew up there and received his early education. He also had to help his father to cultivate his glebe. In 1812 he went to complete his education at Bern, and in 1820 was received as a pastor. In 1821 he visited the University of G\u00f6ttingen, but returned home in 1822 to act as his father's assistant. When his father died in 1824, he went to Herzogenbuchsee as a priest. In 1829, he went to Bern. Early in 1831 he went to help the old pastor of the village of L\u00fctzelfl\u00fch, in the Upper Emmenthal (between Langnau and Burgdorf). In 1832 he was chosen as his successor. He married one of his granddaughters in 1833. He spent the rest of his life there, leaving three children (the son was a pastor, the two daughters married pastors).\nHis first work, the \"Bauernspiegel\", appeared in 1837. It claimed to be the life of Jeremias Gotthelf, narrated by himself, and this name was later adopted by the author as his pen name. It is a living picture of Bernese (or, strictly speaking, Emmenthal) village life, true to nature, and not attempting to gloss over its defects and failings. It is written (like the rest of his works) in German, but contains expressions from the Bernese dialect of the Emmenthal. Unlike Auerbach, Bitzius was not a peasant by birth, but belonged to the educated classes. He reproduces what he had seen and learnt, and not what he had himself personally experienced. The book was a great success, as it was a picture of real life, and not of fancifully beribboned eighteenth-century villagers.\nHis best known work is without doubt the short novel \"Die Schwarze Spinne\" (The Black Spider), a semi-allegorical tale of the plague in form of the titular monster that devastates a Swiss valley community; first as a result of a pact with the devil born out of need and a second time due to the moral decay that releases the monster from its prison again.\nAmong his later tales are the \"Leiden und Freuden eines Schulmeisters\" (1838-1839), \"Uli der Knecht\" (1841), with its continuation, \"Uli der P\u00e4chter\" (1849), \"Anne-B\u00e4bi Jow\u00e4ger\" (1843-1844), \"K\u00e4thi, die Gro\u00dfmutter\" (1846), \"Die K\u00e4serei in der Vehfreude\" (1850), and the \"Erlebnisse eines Schuldenbauers\" (1853). He also published several volumes of shorter tales.\nOne slight drawback to some of his writings is the echo of local political controversies, for Bitzius was a Whig and strongly opposed to the Radical party in the canton, which carried the day in 1846.\nHe died on October 22, 1854 in L\u00fctzelfl\u00fch in Canton of Bern.\nLives by C. Manuel, in the Berlin edition of Bitzius's works (Berlin, 1861), and by J. Ammann in vol. i. (Bern, 1884) of time \"Sammlung Bernischer Biographien\". His works were issued in 24 vols. at Berlin, 1856-1861, while 10 vols., giving the original text of each story, were issued at Bern, 1898-1900.\nReferences.\nThe article is available here ."}

It is also the name of a television channel that often shows these programmes. The programmes are meant for children that are between 6 and 12 years old. The \"Children's BBC\" name began on 9 September 1985. Before then there were BBC children's programmes, but they were not branded under one name. The name \"CBBC\" was used informally since 1990, and became the official name in 1997.\nCBBC programmes are shown on BBC One, BBC Two and the CBBC Channel. CBBC has a sister brand, CBeebies, for children under 6. The CBBC brands for BBC One and BBC Two are \"CBBC One\" and \"CBBC Two\".\nCBBC is run by the BBC Children's department, who make the programmes for children up to the age of 16. Most of their offices are in the East Tower of the BBC Television Centre, with some programmes coming from Scotland and Bristol. CBBC produces a whole range of programme types, including drama, news, entertainment and educational programmes.\nSince February 2006, the Controller of the BBC Children's department has been Richard Deverell. The department splits output into age groups:\nAnne Gilchrist is Creative Director of CBBC, and Michael Carrington is Creative Director of CBeebies.\nPresentation.\nMonday 3 September 2007 saw the fifth CBBC relaunch. As part of the relaunch, new logos, idents, interactive services, programmes and presenters were introduced. The previous computer generated backgrounds used from December 2006 were replaced by a real set.\nEd Petrie became the chief continuity presenter, accompanied by a puppet sidekick \"Oucho T. Cactus\" (operated and voiced by Warrick Brownlow-Pike). They regularly present live, weekday afternoon links on the CBBC channel with Petrie voicing pre-recorded, out-of-vision announcements during for weekdays on BBC One. On 29 August 2008, they went on extended leave to record a new series for CBBC - they returned to continuity duties on 1 December 2008. During this period, relief presenter Holly Walsh presented weekday afternoon links for the channel with Dunceton the Talking Brain.\nAnne Foy presented pre-recorded in-vision links at the weekend alongside her dog, Elliot, until her departure in March 2008. Foy was replaced by two new presenters, Ben Hanson and Ciaran Joyce, who previously appeared in CBBC show \"The Story of Tracy Beaker\". They have since been replaced by comedy double act Dan and Jeff.\nThe idents were replaced with new ones in 2014, but the logo stayed the same.\nOn Monday 14 March 2016, CBBC got a whole new look, which saw a new logo, plus new idents and presentation.\nOther services.\nCBBC extra.\n\"CBBC extra\" is a free interactive television service from CBBC. It is found on the BBCi pages. It is accessible from the CBBC Channel by pressing the red button and then selecting \"CBBC extra\". It can also be accessed from any other BBCi page by pressing 570.\nThe service is different on different digital platforms, for example Sky viewers can access the video loop. But it is only available on Freeview when BBCi is not showing other interactive services, like sports events.\nCBBC extra offers games, the UK Top 40 music, jokes sent in by viewers, \"Nev's Horoscopes\", and a weekly competition. The current presenter of CBBC extra is Ed Petrie.\nIt has been discontinued since CBBC last changed its logo.\nCBBC Quiz.\nThis new feature allows the viewers to play a quiz. There are 15 levels, each containing 5 up to 10 questions. Viewers can also send in their questions which could be shown on the service. The \"CBBC Quiz\" can be from the CBBC extra page, by selecting the option called \"CBBC Quiz\". This option is also available on the main interactive menu on the \"CBBC Channel\", by pressing the red button. \nWebsite.\nThe CBBC website has a wide range of activities, such as games, puzzles, message boards and frequently updated news and more stuff. The website is found .\nMy CBBC.\n\"My CBBC\" is a feature to the new CBBC website. It allows users to create their own room which they can decorate. It is also possible to create your own avatar. The new feature is often promoted on the \"CBBC Channel\".\nAdventure Rock.\n\"Adventure Rock\" (renamed from CBBC World) is a virtual online world that launched on 1 March 2008. Press releases have stated \"it would allow digitally literate children the access to characters and resources they had come to expect. Users would be able to build an online presence, known as an avatar, then create and share content.\"\nThe main points of the system are safety and responsibility online, with no chatrooms or the financial aspects available in other online worlds such as \"Second Life\".\nController of Children's BBC Richard Deverell said: \"\"Adventure Rock\" is a good example of the way we need to go. The thing that interests me is that children are at the vanguard. And that is where we are taking Children's BBC.\"and still fun."}

{"id": "132835", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132835", "title": "Mermaid", "text": "A mermaid is a mythological creature with a female human head and upper body and the tail of a fish. Mermaids are said to live mostly in the water, although sometimes they are known to come out of the water and sit on the large rocks above the sea. It was thought that they would make boats crash with their siren-like calls.\nOverview and etymology.\nThe word is a compound of mere, the Old English word for \"sea\", and maid, a woman. The male equivalent is a merman.\nMuch like sirens, mermaids sometimes sing to people and gods and enchant them, distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off the deck or run their ships aground. Other stories depict them squeezing the life out of drowning men while attempting to rescue them. They are also said to carry humans down to their underwater kingdoms or drown them.\nThe sirens of Greek mythology are sometimes portrayed in later folklore as mermaid-like. But in the Odyssey they are described as birds with women's heads, not women with fish tails. Some languages use the same word for both bird and fish creatures, such as the Maltese word 'sirena'. Other related types of mythical or legendary creatures are water fairies (e.g., various water nymphs) and selkies, animals that can transform themselves from seals to humans.\nHistory.\nAncient Near East.\nThe first known mermaid stories appeared in Assyria, ca. 1000 BC. The goddess Atargatis loved a shepherd and accidentally killed him. She was so sad she jumped into a lake to become a fish, but the waters would not let her beauty be hidden. Because of this, she took the form of a mermaid.\nA popular Greek legend turns Alexander the Great's sister into a mermaid after she died. She lived, it was said, in the Aegean that when she met a ship, she asked its sailors only one question: \"Is King Alexander alive?\" (;\") The answer was \"He lives and reigns and conquers the world\" (Greek: \"\u0396\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\"). If they answered her question correctly, she calmed the waters for the ship, but any other answer would make her angry, and raise a storm.\nArabian Nights.\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" includes several tales have \"Sea People\", such as \"Djullanar the Sea-girl\". Unlike other mythologies, these are almost the same as humans, except the fact that they can breathe and live underwater. They also breed with land humans, the children of them being able to live underwater.\nIn \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", the protagonist Bulukiya's explore the seas, and meets some mermaids.\nBritish Isles.\nMermaids were noted in British folklore as unlucky omens. Several parts of the song \"Sir Patrick Spens\" is about a mermaid speaking to doomed ships, or telling them they will never see land again. Mermaids can also be a sign of bad weather.\nSome mermaids were described as very big, up to .\nMermaids could also swim up rivers to freshwater lakes. One day, in a lake near his house, the Laird of Lorntie went to help a woman he thought drowning, and a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed after him that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.\nSometimes, though, mermaids could appear as nicer characters, teaching humans how to cure diseases.\nMermen were thought of as more wild and ugly than mermaids, but they also were not interested in humans.\nWarsaw Mermaid.\nThe mermaid, or \"syrenka\", is the symbol of Warsaw. Images of a mermaid symbolized Warsaw on its crest since the middle of the 14th century.\nMermaid Sighting.\nSome people claim to have seen dead or living mermaids from places such as Java and British Columbia. There are two Canadian reports from the area of Vancouver and Victoria, BC, one from sometime between 1870 and 1890, the other from 1967.\nIn August 2009, the town of Kiryat Yam in Israel offered a prize of 1 million dollars for anyone who could prove that mermaids existed off its coast, after dozens of people said they had seen a mermaid leaping out of the water like a dolphin and doing tricks in the air before returning back to where it had come from. The prize has not yet been awarded.\nArt and literature.\nOne famous image was created by John William Waterhouse, from 1895 to 1905, called \"A Mermaid\" (see the top of this article). It was an example of late British Academy style art, but disappeared and was not found until the 1970s. It is again in the collection of the Royal Academy.\nThe most famous in more recent centuries is Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" (1836), which has been translated into many languages.\nThe best known musical about mermaids are those by Felix Mendelssohn in his \"Fair Melusina\" and the three \"Rhine daughters\" in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.\nMovies with mermaids in them are drama television series such as \"Charmed\". Animated movies include Disney's popular musical version of Andersen's tale, and Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.\nHeraldry.\nIn heraldry, mermaids are most well known to be presented with a comb or a mirror, and also thought of to be very vain.\nA mermaid that had a shield and sword (\"Syrenka\") is on the official Coat of arms of Warsaw. The city of Norfolk, Virginia also uses a mermaid as a symbol.\nThe personal coat of arms of Micha\u00eblle Jean, Canada's Governor General, features two mermaids.\nHoaxes.\nIn the 19th century, P. T. Barnum showed in his museum a taxidermal hoax called the \"Fiji mermaid.\" Others have made similar hoaxes, which are usually made by paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 or parts of dead creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together too look like a mermaid. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, pictures of Fiji \"mermaids\" came up on the Internet as examples of items that had washed up onto the beach, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.\nSirenia.\nSirenia is a type of plant-eating mammal like the manatee the dugong that only live in rivers, swamps, and in other large areas of water. Mariners used to call these animals mermaids.\nSirenomelia.\nSirenomelia, also called \"mermaid syndrome\", is a rare disorder. It happens when a child is born with his or her legs grown together and little or no genitalia. This, however, is as rare as conjoined twins, and only happens to one out of every 100,000 live births. It is usually very bad for the kidney and bladder, and only about four survivors were known to be alive as of July 2003.\nMermaids in Thai folklore.\nIn Thai folklore \"Phra Abhai Manee\" there is a beautiful mermaid named \"Praphanpheloung\". She is a beautiful lady who has tail instead of legs. The story told us about a charming prince who was taken by the giantess \"Pisua Samudr\" and lived together with her until they have a son named \"Sin -Samudr\". One day Sin Samudr went out of a cave and took a merman to his father who was locked in the cave. The merman knew the story well about a young prince so he want to help him and his son escape from the giantess. The story also mention about what mermaid look like. They are very beautiful with long black hair and pale skin. They love to sing and swim under the moon. Their eyes can be able to see in the dark but blur vision in the sun. Thai folklore \"Phra Abhai Manee\" was written by the famous poet named \"Sunthornphu\" because of the story happened near the shore so people placed his characters statues such as a giantess, the prince and a mermaid at Rayong, Thailand\nIn popular culture.\nMermaids are shown as characters in movies, including \"Splash\" and \"Aquamarine\"."}

It is a very difficult book, even for the German reader.\nIn it, and later works, Heidegger maintained that our way of questioning defines our nature. But philosophy, western civilization's chief way of questioning, has lost its way. Finding ourselves \"always already\" fallen in a world of presuppositions, we lose touch with what being was before its truth became \"muddled\". As a solution to this condition, Heidegger advocated a return to practical life in the world, allowing it to reveal, or \"unconceal\" itself."}

His philosophy was based on materialistic monism. Materialistic monism is the belief that everything in the universe is made of a single substance. Parmenides' biggest argument was that change does not exist. Parmenides' explanation is that we think we see change, but our senses are not reliable, and they create the illusion of change."}

They are eternal, indestructible and invisible particles. They are made of different shapes, different properties and they are always moving. He believed the number of atoms is infinite.\nDemocritus didn't have any scientific evidence. He had these ideas thinking about them.

In chemistry there is a whole class of substances known as alcohols. The alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is known as ethanol or \"grain alcohol\". Grain alcohol is generally made through a process called fermentation. In fermentation, bacteria change sugar to make ethanol or vinegar. Other kinds of alcohol are usually harmful to drink, so the only kind of alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is grain alcohol. Since most people do not have to use any other kind of alcohol except ethanol, they will use the word \"alcohol\" to mean only ethanol. Sometimes people also use the word \"alcohol\" to talk about any drink containing ethanol, such as whiskey, vodka, or gin.\nFermenting grain can only make a drink that is 20% alcohol. To get higher amounts of alcohol in drinks, distillation is used. This allows to get substances that are made of alcohol to about 80-85% (Certain kinds of Rum used for cooking are at 70\u201380% alcohol). When beverages are sold, the amount of alcohol is listed as alcoholic proof rather than percentage. \nGenerally, alcoholic drinks are divided into three classes:\nMost countries limit the sale of the different kinds of alcohol. Usually there are two limits, one for wines and beers, and the other for distilled alcoholic drinks. \nAlcopops are very sweet, and usually do not contain much alcohol (most have less than beer), but many governments make it illegal to buy them in certain places or at certain times because they have distilled alcohol mixed into them. They are controversial because some people think that they might be popular among young people.\nDrinking ethanol causes a person to feel relaxed. Ethanol is very commonly used, and has been made by humans for thousands of years. It is one of the oldest and most used recreational drug (drugs used for fun) in the world. People may overuse it for the same reason. The addiction to alcohol is called alcoholism. Alcoholic drinks can be dangerous. If a person drinks a lot of alcohol, they become intoxicated, meaning that they get drunk. People who are drunk may do or say strange or dangerous things and may not be able to control themselves. The amount of alcohol that it takes to get somebody drunk is different from person to person. All alcohols are toxic, but ethanol is less toxic because the human body can break it down quickly. Some strong alcohols can also cause intoxication and impairment."}

She is the lead vocalist and co-founder of the rock/metal band Evanescence. She is also a classically trained pianist and a multi-instrumentalist.\nLee is musically influenced by musicians and artists of different genres, from classical artists such as Mozart to modern artists like Bj\u00f6rk, Portishead, Danny Elfman, Korn and Tori Amos. Lee is the main lyricist and composer in the band and won the National Music Publisher's Association's Songwriter Icon Award in 2008 for her achievements as a songwriter. As of mid-2007, she is the only original band member who is still in the band.\nLee is the spokesperson of the Epilepsy Foundation. She started a campaign called \"Out of the Shadows\". She advocates for the \"To Write Love on Her Arms\" organization. She was chosen as the 2012 recipient of the Luella Bennack award at United Cerebral Palsy's 11th annual Women Who Care luncheon for her community projects and social impact.\nLee ranked at #69 in Hit Parader's list of \"Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time\". She was #49 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Women in Music\". She was listed by About.com as one of the greatest female rock artists. She won the 2012 Revolver's Golden Gods award for best vocalist, and was named the 2012 \"Rock Goddess of the Year\" in the Loudwire Music Awards.\nBiography.\nLee was born in Riverside, California. Her parents were John Lee, a disc jockey, and Sara Lee (n\u00e9e Cargill). She was named after the 1970s song \"Amie\" by Pure Prairie League. Her family moved to many places. They settled in Little Rock, Arkansas when she was 13 years old. She has two sisters, Carrie and Lori, and one brother, Robby. She had a third sister who died 1987. Lee wrote the songs \"Hello\" and \"Like You\" for her late sister. She is mostly of Scottish and English heritage. Lee recalls growing up around music and that she and her siblings, took music lessons.\nLee first wanted to become a classical composer. She wrote \"Eternity of the Remorse\" on piano at the age of eleven. She describes it as a \"depressing\" and \"dramatic\" piece. Her first \"real\" song is \"A Single Tear\". It was written for an English assignment for eighth grade. She wrote the song and recorded it on a cassette with a friend who sang back-up vocals.\nLee studied at Pulaski Academy. She identified herself as an \"art nerd\" or \"choir nerd\" during her high school years and would listen to alternative and heavy metal music. She joined the school's mixed choir and sang as an alto. She became president of the choir council in her senior year. At age 17, Lee wrote a choir arrangement called \"Listen to the Rain\". It impressed her choir teacher, who encouraged Lee to direct the choir's performance of the song. Her direction of the choir during her graduation ceremony received a positive reaction from the audience. This experience made her feel more accepted for her skills amongst her peers. The song was also featured in Evanescence's EP \"Sound Asleep\".\nLee described her school years as a \"weird fit for [her]\" and was \"a loner for while\". She believes that this is what inspired her to get into writing, which became an \"outlet for all the bad stuff [she] was feeling\". Lee was voted to be on homecoming court, but missed the announcement because she didn't expect to get chosen. She graduated from high school in 2000. She briefly attended Middle Tennessee State University to study music theory and composition. She dropped out to focus on her band.\nEvanescence.\nFounding.\nBen Moody first met Lee at a Christian youth summer camp in 1994 and was impressed by her performance of the Meat Loaf song \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Will not Do That)\" on the piano. The two started writing songs together and performing at bookstores and coffee houses. After two of their songs were played on local radio stations, they became more popular in their area and were asked to appear in local concerts. The band went on to make two EPs, \"Evanescence EP\" (1998) \"and Sound Asleep/Whisper EP\" (1999). The EPs were distributed and sold to concert audiences.\nIn 2001, the band went to Ardent Studios in Memphis to mix a number of demos. There they met producer Pete Matthews who was impressed by their work and invited the band to move to Memphis and work on more songs while he showcased their demos to a number of labels. After playing the song \"My Immortal\" to Matthews' friend Diana Meltzer at Wind-Up Records, she became interested in signing the band a record deal. The band moved to Los Angeles once they were signed; however, because they were \"still young and needed to be developed\", they were enrolled in an artist development program for two years before they were given a producer to work with. During this time, Lee was given classes in stage presence and movement. She also applied to become a waitress before Fallen was released.\nControversies.\nLee was involved in a number of controversial issues with the band. Moody left the band in 2003 because of \"creative differences\" with Lee. Moody later explained his reason for leaving Evanescence in an interview with MTV \"If I stayed, I think Amy and I would have destroyed [Evanescence] because we just weren't heading in the same direction; we were pulling it in two different directions. It was bad\". Moody also revealed in an interview with Spin Magazine that he had tried convincing her of leaving the band instead \"I had tried before, out of ignorance, pride, and resentment, to convince Amy that she should leave. That we'd be better off and Evanescence didn't need her\" and followed this statement with an apology to Lee.\nLee has not spoken to Moody since his departure from the band. She stated in an interview with Blender in 2006 that she doesn't hate Ben, but they \"need to just live [their] separate lives\". In an interview with MTV, Moody hinted towards his advances for mending their relationship by inviting her for a movie along with David Hodges. Though Lee didn't respond, a representative told Moody that she was actually considering accepting the invitation.\nIn 2005, former Evanescence manager Dennis Rider filed a $10 million lawsuit against Lee for breach of contract, which she responded to with a counter-suit for \"breach of fiduciary duty\" among other claims.\nIn 2007, she fired guitarist John LeCompt and soon after, drummer Rocky Gray quit the band, making Lee the only original member left in the band. In a blog post, LeCompt claimed that Lee fired him through a phone call without \"any warning or negotiations\" and \"for no good reason\". Lee defended her choice, claiming that LeCompt \"didn't really care about Evanescence at all, and just stayed around for the money\" and that she fired him to save the band from being \"driven into the ground\". Later, in an interview with Spin Magazine, Lee noted that both LeCompt and Gray's writing \"didn't work for Evanescence\" and believes they \"got bored or frustrated\" because of this.\nLee often addresses these issues in interviews. In an interview with MTV, Lee noted that \"there's always freaking drama\". However, since the line-up change in 2010, Lee has stated that the band has become \"stronger\" and more cohesive.\nArtistry.\nLee is the main lyricist and composer in the band, being credited as a songwriter in every song since the release of Fallen. She also maintains solo writing credits for songs such as Lithium and Lost in Paradise. Lee claims that during her years as a high school student, she would listen to music that was not necessarily popular at the time. Her lyrics are often associated to themes ranging from hopelessness, introspection and loss to self-respect and empowerment.\nLee is influenced by a variety of artists and genres. Her music is often described as a blend between rock and classical music, possessing an emotional and dark character. During her early years, Lee wanted to be a classical composer after watching the movie Amadeus, which was based on the life of Mozart. She wrote her first classical composition on piano at the age of 11 and describes it as a \"very dramatic\" piece. She also named \"Lacrymosa\", a part of Mozart's Requiem, her favorite classical music piece.\nShe credits \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" as her \"number one biggest influence artistically in every way\" and would often sing to \"Sally\u2019s Song\" when she was younger. She cites Bj\u00f6rk as a big influence. In an interviews with Revolver Magazine, Lee noted Bj\u00f6rk's influence on her lyrics \"The way [Bj\u00f6rk] uses the English language, probably because it\u2019s not her first language, she uses it for the way the words sound as much as what the words mean. That always inspired me. When I\u2019m writing lyrics, I think that way, too. I want the meaning to matter, but the way they actually sound coming out your mouth matters, too\". She also listed songs such as \"Pagan Poetry\", \"Joga\" and \"Crystalline\" as some of her favorite and most inspirational Bj\u00f6rk songs. Additionally, Michael Jackson was one of Lee's music idols as a teenager and considers him to be highly inspirational. Other influences include: Portishead, Tori Amos, Nirvana, Korn, Marvin Gaye, Massive Attack, Depeche Mode and SoundGarden.\nLee has stated in several interviews that she likes to experiment with different musical elements and doesn't like \"doing the same thing over and over again\". She has experimented with electronic music, most prominently in the first sessions of the pre-production phase of the bands' third album. She has also expressed interest in folk music.\nLee has been classically trained in piano for 9 years and uses simple chords with left-hand backing in songs. She often includes the piano as a main or background instrument into the bands' music, most prominently in the album \"The Open Door\". Several music critics consider the piano accompaniment as a characteristic feature of Evanescence's music. Lee often plays the piano during live performances in selected songs, and has been known to cover songs on the piano as well, such the Korn song \u201cThoughtless\u201d. She can play the acoustic guitar and has been training in harp, lightly utilizing this instrument in the bands' third record, most prominently in the song \"Secret Door\".\nAmerican recording artist Kelly Clarkson described Lee's concert performances as \"intense\" and thinks that she's \"a beautiful vocalist, and has great taste in melodies and music\". Clarkson also revealed through her Twitter that she would like to sing a duet with Lee.\nVoice.\nLee's vocal range spans 3.6 octaves from a low A2 (2003 Fallen Vocal warm up) to an E6 in full head voice (MTV Video Diary). Her highest recorded note in full head voice is a C#6 in the song \"Weight of the World\" and her lowest recorded note is a C3 in the cover of U2's song \"With or Without You\". Lee's highest mixed note in studio recording is a G#5 in the collaboration with American rock band Halestorm's song \"Break In\". Overall, her highest mixed note is a Bb5 in a cover of Michael Jackson's song \"Dirty Diana\". Lee has also been known for her scream in the song \"Tourniquet\" also, in which is in the note of a D5. In an MTV special, Lee managed to hit an E6 live during a vocal warm-up in full head voice, also showing that she is capable of reaching up to Bb7 through exclamation. She is popularly classified as a full-lyric mezzo-soprano, though this has not been confirmed by Lee herself.\nLee is not professionally trained in singing and applies what she learned from her years as a choir member in high school. Her lower to mid-range belts are often supported, if not resonant, and she can sustain notes in the 5th octave in all vowels. She also uses several vocal dynamics in her singing, most notably crescendos.\nCritics often consider Lee's vocals to be one of the highlights of the bands' music, describing it as \"ethereal\", \"dramatic\" and \"haunting\", while praising its \"powerful\", \"crystalline\" and \"operatic\" qualities.\nSongwriting and lyrical themes.\nA very notable theme in Lee's lyrics is relationship struggles. She often identifies various events in life with a story between herself and a lover, evident in the song \"What You Want\" which is actually inspired by her love for her band and fans. She also writes about her actual relationship struggles, examples include \"Call Me When You\u2019re Sober\", referring to her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan. Additionally, she often incorporates dark and mysterious themes into the bands' music, and has mentioned that she is particularly fascinated with the idea of death and beyond. She also resorts to imaginative and picturesque themes as seen in songs such as \"Imaginary\" and \"Lithium\". The songs \"Hello\" and \"Like You\" were written in honor of Lee's deceased sister.\nFurthermore, Lee's songs are generally inspired by her life struggles and personal experiences. \"Bring Me to Life\" was written after meeting a psychiatrist who understood her hidden feelings, while \"Snow White Queen\" was written after a turbulent experience with a stalker. She described her writing process in the song \"All That I\u2019m Living For\", explaining that she mostly writes at night time.\nAfter Moody's departure from the band, Lee dismissed the public assumption that Evanescence's music would be softer and that \"all the sappy stuff comes from [her]\", explaining that Moody was \"more about the pop influence and being commercial\" while she wanted to do \"the more artistic, weird thing\".\nLee wrote most of the bands' self-titled album with the fans in mind, describing her relationship with them through different lyrical themes. She also explored more into global issues such as sex trafficking and the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami for this album in the songs \"My Heart is Broken\" and \"Never Go Back\", respectively.\nLee was honored by the National Music Publisher's Association with their 2008 Songwriter Icon Award, which recognizes outstanding songwriters for personal achievement. Lee received the award during the annual NMPA meeting in New York City and performed a song to the attendance as well.\nImage and style.\nLee has an eclectic clothing style mostly inspired by Victorian, Gothic and Japanese fashion. She is known to design many of her outfits, such as the outfits she wore for the video of \"Going Under\" and the dress she wore to the Noble Peace Prize concert in 2011. She occasionally makes her clothes herself. In an interview with VEVO stylized, Lee showcased and explained her fashion style, commenting that she'd rather make her own clothes because it's hard to find what she exactly wants elsewhere. Lee stated that her daily style is very different from when she performs; describing it as \"funky, spooky, cute\" in an interview. She explained that her on-stage wardrobe was meant to preserve the atmosphere of the songs and complete the image. In another interview, she stated that when the band first started performing, she used to heavily wear corsets in fear of diluting the bands' image, but has gradually become more comfortable with her own style. Her current on-stage style is often characterized by boots, a simple black tank top, a skirt and various ornaments and accessories.\nFurthermore, Lee dyes her hair jet black. During the Fallen era, she used to use blue contact lenses and had a distinct piercing on her left eyebrow. She has not used them since.\nMany fans admire Lee for not using sex appeal in her music. Lee frequently criticized women who are involved in show-business for abusing their positions as idols by sexualizing their image. The song \"Everybody\u2019s Fool\" was written by Lee to mock such celebrities after seeing how her sister was infatuated by this trend. The video to this song emphasizes how celebrities peddle lies through projecting an image opposite to who they are.\nIn 2005, Lee came in 4th in Kerrang!'s 50 Sexiest People in Rock list. She was listed in Blender as one of the hottest women in rock in 2006, alongside other singers such as Joan Jett and Liz Phair. Revolver Magazine named Lee the #1 Hottest Chick in Hard Rock for their 2011 annual issue and she appeared on the front cover. When asked about this in an interview, Lee responded \"You have to look at all of that as just press. I'm not the hottest chick in whatever. I'm a normal girl and it takes a lot of makeup and retouching to make that cover look good\". She also came in at #9 in KROQ's 2011 list of \"The Twenty Sexiest Singers of Female-Fronted Rock Bands\".\nPersonal life.\nLee is married to therapist and long time friend Josh Hartzler. They were engaged on January 8, 2007, with Lee making the first official announcement on January 9. They were married on May 6, 2007 and through a post to the bands' fan club message boards, she announced that she was \"officially Mrs. Amy Hartzler\". Hartzler was the inspiration behind the songs \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"Good Enough\".\nLee was involved in a romantic relationship with Seether frontman Shaun Morgan from 2003 till 2005. Their breakup inspired Lee to write the song \"Call When Me You're Sober\" which she said was about \"the big relationship [she] was in, and the whole breakup, which was really long\". Morgan responded to the song, saying that he was \"really upset that she would say and do those things\" yet \"didn't feel the need to write back and be mean\".\nWhen she was younger, Lee wanted to become a veterinarian, but lost her interest after seeing a dog surgery on the television. Lee mentioned that if she wasn't pursuing a career in music, she would have entered a field in which she could help people, especially abused kids. During the bands' hiatus, Lee was considering taking a job as a music teacher for children.\nLee's hobbies include painting and cooking. She sketched the design of the cover art for \"The Open Door\" and painted the cover art of the charity single \"Together Again\". She also hinted during a Q&amp;A with fans that she wanted to start a cooking show. Lee owns two cats named Stella and Shermie.\nIn 2011, Lee explained that one of the reasons behind Evanescence's lengthy hiatus after the conclusion of \"The Open Door Tour\" was because she was feeling pressurized by her band duties, mostly due to the hectic schedule and quick rise to fame. According to Lee, she \"just needed to get away from it\" and \"wanted to be a normal person for a minute\" because her \"entire adult life [...] was all about [Evanescence]\".\nSocial efforts.\nLee became the American chairperson of the Epilepsy foundation in 2005, and started a campaign called \"Out of the Shadows\" to raise awareness about epilepsy. She gained interest about this medical condition because her brother suffers from epilepsy.\nLee supports and advocates To Write Love on Her Arm, a non-profit organization aiming to help people struggling with depression, addiction and self-harm. In 2010, she supported Restore Freedom, a campaign against sex trafficking, where she helped and advocated towards building a safehouse in New York that shelters and helps survivors of sex trafficking. She currently has page in the Restore NYC website in which she urges people to donate and help the cause. Lee later revealed that being involved in this cause inspired her to write the song \"My Heart is Broken\".\nLee was chosen as the 2012 recipient of the Luella Bennack award at United Cerebral Palsy's 11th annual Women Who Care luncheon, which celebrates women who dedicate time for community projects and charities. In a statement released by the UCP of New York City, Lee was selected \"because of her personal pledge to making life more accessible and understood by everyone\", as well as for the \"integrity\" of her music that \"inspired and transformed millions of women worldwide\".\nOther projects.\nIn 2000, Lee was featured in two songs by former Evanescence member David Hodges, \"Breathe\" and \"Fall into You\". In 2003, Lee joined artists such as Milla Jovovich and Maynard James Keenan in a discrete musical project for supergroup The Damning Well. She provided vocals on two tracks, one of which was a duet with former Filter vocalist Richard patrick, but her vocals were eventually taken off the final release because of record label issues. She also sang backup vocals on Big Dismal's song \"Believe\" from their first album.\nLee appeared in the Seether song \"Broken\" in 2004, where she performed a duet with Shaun Morgan. The song was featured in Seether's 2004 album, Disclaimer II, and soundtrack for the 2004 movie The Punisher. Broken was released as a single and Lee appeared in the music video wearing black wings.\nIn February 2007, during an MTV: Unplugged session featuring the band Korn, Lee performed a duet with vocalist Jonathan Davis in an acoustic version of the song \"Freak on a Leash\". MTV later released the song as part of MTV: Unplugged Korn, and became the first single off the album.\nDuring Finger Eleven's opening act for an Evanescence concert in Providence, Rhode Island in 2007, Lee came on stage to perform the song \"One Thing\" with the band. Additionally, Lee performed the song \"Epiphany\" with Staind's lead singer Aaron Lewis during the 2007 \"My Coke Fest\" held in Johannesburg, South Africa.\nWhen asked who she was interested in collaborating with, Lee chose Depeche Mode, Danny Elfman and Daft Punk. She further described a collaboration in which Elfman would write music similar to movie scores, while Lee would write the vocal parts and lyrics.\nSolo album.\nLee hinted towards releasing a solo album since 2008. Lee told Spin Magazine that she wanted to prove she's \"more than a one trick pony\" and would like to do something different. She also mentioned that the music she was writing at the time was \"nothing [she] would categorize as Evanescence\".\nAfter writing much of the material for Evanescence's third album, Lee decided to scrap the songs and start over with the writing process because the songs were \"not right for Evanescence\" and had little involvement from the rest of the band members. However, in an interview with Pulse of Radio, Lee noted the possibility of using the discarded tracks in future projects \"I think it\u2019s totally possible that some of those songs will end up in a different project someday \u2013 maybe solo, maybe something else\".\nOther appearances.\nLee made an appearance on Cartoon Network in 2004, where she \"did an interview with a puppet\" and performed a \"cheesy song on the guitar about Cartoon Network\". She made this appearance for her brother, Robby, who was 10 at the time.\nShe appeared briefly in the music video for Johnny Cash's \"God\u2019s Gonna Cut You Down\" in late 2006. Each celebrity was allowed to choose what they would be doing for the video, so Lee chose to appear laying flowers on a grave. Her scene was recorded at Trinity Church and she was wearing a black velvet coat that previously belonged to Tim Burton. In November 2007, Lee was one of the celebrity cameos in the VH1 mockumentary \"Rock Band Cometh: The Rock Band Band Story\" that was released to promote the game Rock Band.\nLee was featured in an episode of \"Legends &amp; Lyrics\" alongside artists Gaven DeGraw and Dwight Yoakam, where she performed an acoustic set of songs, including \"Bring Me to Life\", \"Lithium\" and a previously unheard song titled \"Your Love\", and explained her musical style and songwriting process."}

These warheads are attached to a rocket motor and the rocket has fins which help it to fly straight. Some types of RPG are reloadable, while others are used only once and then thrown away. RPGs, with the exception of self-contained versions, are muzzleloaders, loaded from the front end. \nRPGs with High explosive anti-tank warheads are very effective against armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers (APCs). They can also be used against tanks, as long as the shooter targets a weak part of the tank, such as the tracks or the top door of the turret. \nIn general, the front armour on a tank is too thick to be penetrated by an RPG warhead. In some cases, teams attacking tanks with RPGs will have multiple RPG users fire at the same tank, which may penetrate the armour. Insurgents have sometimes successfully used RPGs to shoot at helicopters."}

He was a native of Ephesus, Ionia, on the coast of Asia Minor.\nHis teaching, as we have it now, is a series of epigrams. This means his teachings are sayings and remarks, rather than systematic essays. Heraclitus is famous for his doctrine of change being central to the universe. His famous sayings, \"All is flux\", and \"You cannot step twice into the same river\" is still remembered today. Another of his sayings appeals to some psychologists:\nOften it is difficult to understand what he was trying to say. He believed in the unity of opposites, stating that \"the path up and down are one and the same\".\nHis utterance that \"all things come to be in accordance with this \"logos\",\" (literally, \"word,\" \"reason,\" or \"account\") has been the subject of many interpretations.\n\"Logos\" became a technical term in philosophy, beginning with Heraclitus, who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.\nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius states that Heraclitus' work was \"a continuous treatise \"On Nature\", but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology.\" Theophrastus says (in Diogenes) \"...\u00a0some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley\".\nDiogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book as a dedication in the great temple of Artemis, the Artemisium, one of the largest temples of the 6th century BC, and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances. Many later philosophers refer to the work."}

He was from Miletus in Asia Minor. Many, notably Aristotle, regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition.\nAccording to Bertrand Russell, \"Western philosophy begins with Thales\". Thales attempted to explain natural phenomena without reference to mythology and was tremendously influential in this respect. Almost all of the other pre-Socratic philosophers follow him in attempting to provide an explanation of ultimate substance, change, and the existence of the world\u2014without reference to mythology. Those philosophers were also influential, and eventually Thales' rejection of mythological explanations became an essential idea for science. He was also the first to define general principles and set forth hypotheses. As a result he has been called the \"Father of Science\", though maybe Democritus is more deserving of this title.\nIn mathematics, Thales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Also, Thales was the first person known to have studied electricity."}

In Ancient Greece, sophism was practiced by \"sophists\", who were a group of teachers of philosophy and rhetoric. In the modern definition, a sophism is a confusing or slightly incorrect argument used for deceiving someone.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"sophism\" originated from the Greek word \u03c3\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1, \"sophisma\" (from \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b6\u03c9, \"sophizo\" meaning \"I am wise\"). \nThe similar Greek word \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, \"sophist\u0113s\" means \"wise-ist, one who does wisdom, one who makes a business out of wisdom\" while \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2, \"soph\u00f3s\" means a \"wise man\".\nHistory.\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Protagoras \n(ca. 490\u2013420\u00a0BC) is often said to be the first of the sophists. Others include: Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias, Thrasymachus, Lycophron, Callicles, Antiphon, and Cratylus.\nPlato opposed those sophists because they only abused wisdom for their own interest and refused the truth and justice.\nModern usage.\nIn modern usage, \"sophism\", \"sophist\", and \"sophistry\" are derogatory terms, due the influence of many philosophers in the past. Sophism and platonism were rival schools, as enemies of each other.\nA \"sophism\" is a statement to deceive someone in a debate or conversation. It might be made to seem to make sense when really being wrong, or it might use difficult words and complicated sentences to intimidate the audience into agreeing. An argument \"ad hominem\" is an example of sophistry.\nA \"sophist\" is a person who uses sophisms. \"Sophistry\" means using sophisms for subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation."}

By this, he meant that nothing is absolutely truth, but there are different truths for each person, and each person makes the truth for themselves. For example, one person might go outside on a cold day and feel some water in a bucket, and they will say that the water is warm. And another person might go outside on a hot day and feel the same water, but they will say that the water feels cold to them. Each person is right."}

Some of these codes were used by real pirates; others are from movies.\nHistorical articles of piracy.\nIn the second half of the 17th century, pirates started following rules. These rules had many different names, including Chasse-Partie, Charter Party, Custom of the Coast, or Jamaica Discipline. Eventually, they became known as Articles of Agreement, or the pirate's code. These changed from one captain to another. Sometimes they were different from one voyage (journey) to another. These rules included punishments for rule breakers and said how much treasure each crew member would receive.\nEach crew member signed the articles (or if they could not write, they would make a mark to show they agreed). After the rules were signed, they were then posted in a common place, often the door of the grand cabin.\nThere are three known sets of these rules that still exist today. Most of these come from Charles Johnson's book \"A General History of the Pyrates\". Part of a code from Henry Morgan, a famous British pirate, is remembered in a book called \"The Buccaneers of America\" by Alexandre Exquemelin, who probably sailed with Morgan as a ship's doctor. Very few of these rules still exist today, because often pirates burned the papers before being caught. They did this to prevent these papers from being used against them.\nBartholomew Roberts' articles.\nOne of the most famous sets of pirate rules was written in 1720 by the famous Welsh pirate Bartholomew Roberts.\nI. Every man has a vote in affairs of moment; has equal title to the fresh provisions, or strong liquors, at any time seized, and may use them at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing among them) makes it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a retrenchment.\n\"(This means that all crew members can vote on issues on the ship. All crew members can have any food or drink they have stolen, unless there is not much to go around.)\"\nII. Every man to be called fairly in turn, by list, on board of prizes because, (over and above their proper share) they were on these occasions allowed a shift of clothes: but if they defrauded the company to the value of a dollar in plate, jewels, or money, marooning was their punishment. If the robbery was only betwixt one another, they contented themselves with slitting the ears and nose of him that was guilty, and set him on shore, not in an uninhabited place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter hardships.\n\"(When the pirates stole money or other treasure, every pirate would get a share. But if one pirate defrauded the group by taking more than his share, he would be punished by marooning - being left alone on an island where there were no other people, with no food or water and no way to escape. If a pirate stole from one other pirate, the guilty pirate would be punished by having his ears and nose cut, and left on shore.)\"\nIII. No person to game at cards or dice for money.\n\"(This means that crew members cannot gamble using money while playing cards or dice)\"\nIV. The lights and candles to be put out at eight o'clock at night: if any of the crew, after that hour still remained inclined for drinking, they were to do it on the open deck.\n\"(This means that all fires had to be put out by 8:00\u00a0PM. If crew members wanted to drink after 8:00\u00a0PM, then they had to do it on deck.)\"\nV. To keep their piece, pistols, and cutlass clean and fit for service.\n\"(This means that crew members' weapons had to be kept clean)\"\nVI. No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man were to be found seducing any of the latter sex, and carried her to sea, disguised, he was to suffer death;(so that when any fell into their hands, as it chanced in the Onslow, they put a sentinel immediately over her to prevent ill consequences from so dangerous an instrument of division and quarrel; but then here lies the roguery; they contend who shall be sentinel, which happens generally to one of the greatest bullies, who, to secure the lady's virtue, will let none lie with her but himself.)\n\"(This means that no young boys or women were allowed to be crew members. If a crew member took a woman out to sea in disguise, then he would be killed as punishment.)\"\nVII. To desert the ship or their quarters in battle, was punished with death or marooning.\n\"(This means that if a crew member ran away from battle, he would be killed or left on a deserted island.)\"\nVIII. No striking one another on board, but every man's quarrels to be ended on shore, at sword and pistol. (The quarter-master of the ship, when the parties will not come to any reconciliation, accompanies them on shore with what assistance he thinks proper, and turns the disputant back to back, at so many paces distance; at the word of command, they turn and fire immediately, (or else the piece is knocked out of their hands). If both miss, they come to their cutlasses, and then he is declared the victor who draws the first blood.)\n\"(This means that the crew members were not allowed to fight on the ship. If they had to fight, they would fight on shore. They would start with a duel where both pirates tried to shoot each other. If both of them missed, they would fight with their swords. They were not allowed any help from other crew members in their fight.)\"\nIX. No man to talk of breaking up their way of living, till each had shared one thousand pounds. If in order to this, any man should lose a limb, or become a cripple in their service, he was to have eight hundred dollars, out of the public stock, and for lesser hurts, proportionately.\n\"(This means that no crew member was allowed to leave the ship's crew until each member had 1000 pounds' share of plunder (stolen money or goods). If a crew member became seriously injured, he would be given 800 dollars.)\"\nX. The captain and quartermaster to receive two shares of a prize: the master, boatswain, and gunner, one share and a half, and other officers one and quarter.\n\"(The captain and the quartermaster each receive two shares of stolen money or goods (double what the regular pirates got). The master, boatswain, and gunner each receive one and a half shares of stolen money or goods. Other officers receive one and one fourth shares of stolen money or goods.)\"\nXI. The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath Day, but the other six days and nights, none without special favour.\n\"(Musicians could not play music on the Sabbath Day.)\"\nCaptain John Phillips's articles.\nCaptain John Phillips, captain of the \"Revenge\", also set a code for his men in 1724:\nI. Every Man Shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one full Share and a half of all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner shall have one Share and quarter.\n\"(Every pirate had to obey the rules and orders of the Captain and other people in charge. The Captain would get one and a half shares of any stolen money or goods. The Master, Carpenter, Boatswain, and Gunner would get one and a quarter shares.)\"\nII. If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, he shall be marooned with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one small Arm, and Shot.\n\"(If any pirate talked about running away from the ship, or kept any secret from the group, he would be marooned. A pirate who was marooned by Captain Phillips would be left on a deserted island with one bottle of water, a small gun, a bottle of gunpowder and one bullet, so he could shoot and kill himself if he wanted to.)\"\nIII. If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to the Value of a Piece of Eight, he shall be marooned or shot.\n\"(If a pirate stole anything from the ship that was worth more than a piece of eight (a Spanish dollar), he would be marooned or killed.)\"\nIV. If any time we shall meet another Marooner that Man shall sign his Articles without the Consent of our Company, shall suffer such Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit.\nV. That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force, shall receive Moses\u2019s Law (that is, 40 Stripes lacking one) on the bare Back.\n\"(A pirate who hit another pirate would be whipped 39 times on his bare back.)\"\nVI. That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoke Tobacco in the Hold, without a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a Lanthorn, shall suffer the same Punishment as in the former Article.\n\"(A pirate that fired a gun when not in battle, smoked tobacco in the hold (where gunpowder was kept), or carried a candle that was not in a lantern, would be whipped 39 times on the bare back. These things were dangerous because they could start fires on the ship or make the gunpowder on the ship explode.)\"\nVII. That Man shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such other Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit.\n\"(If a pirate did not keep his weapons clean and ready for battle, or did not do his job, he would not get a share of any stolen money or goods. He could also be punished in any other way that the Captain and other pirates decided.)\"\nVIII.

A lot of other people who sing it mix lyrics from both versions, and occasionally make direct lyric changes; for example, in place of Cohen's \"holy dove\", Canadian-American singer Rufus Wainwright changed it to \"holy dark\", while Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe sang \"holy ghost\".\nMeaning.\nCanadian singer k.d. lang said in an interview shortly after Cohen's death that she considered the song to be about \"the struggle between having human desire and searching for spiritual wisdom. It's being caught between those two places.\" Former Barenaked Ladies frontman Steven Page, who sang the song at Canadian politician Jack Layton's funeral, described the song as being \"about disappointing people\"."}

His work was mostly about religion, politics, sexuality, and personal relationships most notably seen in his best known work \"Hallelujah\". \nCohen was added into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame as well as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.\nEarly life.\nCohen was born on September 21, 1934 in Westmount, Quebec into a middle-class Canadian Jewish family. His mother was Marsha (Masha) Klonitsky and his father was Nathan Cohen. Cohen's father died when he was nine years old. \nDuring his high school years in Westmount, Cohen learned and played the guitar many times and wrote poems. He studied at McGill University.\nCareer.\nCohen started a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s. Cohen did not start his music career until 1967, at the age of 33. His first album, \"Songs of Leonard Cohen\" (1967), was followed by three more albums of folk music: \"Songs from a Room\" (1969), \"Songs of Love and Hate\" (1971) and \"New Skin for the Old Ceremony\" (1974). \nHis 1977 record \"Death of a Ladies' Man\" was co-written and produced by Phil Spector. In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional \"Recent Songs\", which blended his acoustic style with jazz and Oriental and Mediterranean influences.\n\"Hallelujah\" was first released on Cohen's studio album \"Various Positions\" in 1984. Cohen wrote around 80 draft verses for \"Hallelujah\", with one writing session at the Royalton Hotel in New York where he was reduced to sitting on the floor in his underwear, banging his head on the floor. This became Cohen's best known work. \"I'm Your Man\" in 1988 marked Cohen's most popular album with the song \"Everybody Knows\". In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, \"The Future\", which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest.\nCohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of \"Ten New Songs\", which was a major hit in Canada and Europe. His eleventh album, \"Dear Heather\", followed in 2004. After a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2010, Cohen released three albums in the final four years of his life: \"Old Ideas\" (2012), \"Popular Problems\" (2014) and \"You Want It Darker\" (2016), the last of which was released three weeks before his death.\nPersonal life.\nThough never married, Cohen had two children: Adam and Lorca with his girlfriend Suzanne Elrod. He was also romantically linked with Marianne Ihlen, Janis Joplin and Rebecca De Mornay.\nDeath.\nCohen died in 7 November 2016 of leukemia and from complications of a fall in his sleep at his home in Los Angeles, aged 82.\nHis funeral was held on November 10, 2016 in Montreal, at a cemetery on Mount Royal, his congregation Shaar Hashomayim confirmed.\nAs was his wish, Cohen was laid to rest with a Jewish rite, in a simple pine casket, in a family plot."}

The broadcast meteorologists are employed by the Met Office. The longest serving presenter of BBC weather was Michael Fish, now retired, who appeared for 30 years between 1974 and 2004.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first BBC weather forecast was a shipping forecast read on the radio for the Met Office on 14 November 1922. The first daily weather forecast was broadcast 26 March 1923.\nIn 1936, the BBC experimented with the world's first weather maps on television. Weather maps were first published in \"The Times\" on 1 April 1875. The BBC started broadcasting the maps in 1949 after World War II. The map filled the whole TV screen, and an off-screen narrator would comment on the next day's weather.\nAdvance of technology.\nOn 11 January 1954, George Cowling was the first weather forecaster to stand in front of a weather map. To do this, the maps were drawn by hand in the London Weather Centre and were taken across London. The forecasts were presented by the same person who had made them, and were not always right.\nIn 1962, a fax machine and an electronic computer were bought by the Met Office. This gave better and quicker forecasting.\nSatellite photography was available from 1964, but was of a poor quality and was given on paper, with the coastline etched in felt-tip pen. This did not change until 1973 when a new computer was bought. This made forecasts twice as accurate as earlier ones.\nGraphical technology.\nAs computational capability improved, so did graphics technology. Early hand-drawn maps gave way to magnetic symbols, which in turn gave way to bluescreen (CSO) computer-generated imagery technology, each of which allowed the presenter greater control over the information displayed.\nEarly magnetic symbols tended to adhere poorly to the maps, and occasional spelling errors (such as the presenter writing 'GOF' instead of 'FOG') marred some broadcasts, but allowed the presenter to show how weather would change over time. The symbols were designed to be 'self-explicit', allowing the viewer to understand the map without a key or legend.\nThese were phased out in 1985 for computer graphics, although the basic design of symbols was kept the same. These forecasts were widely acclaimed for their simplicity, winning an award from the Royal Television Society.\nGreat Storm of 1987 Controversy.\nPossibly the most famous of the forecasters is the now retired Michael Fish. Famous for his informal manner and eccentric dress sense (he once wore a blue and green blazer emblazoned with all the weather symbols), he was a viewer favourite despite an unfortunate comment before The Great Storm of 1987.\nDuring a weather forecast some hours before the storm, Michael Fish started his forecast with the now famous line \nAlthough he was actually referring to a Florida hurricane (Floyd), and went on to forecast stormy conditions over the South of England, the statement has gone down in popular culture as one of the worst mistakes made so publicly.\n2000-05 graphics.\nOn 2 October 2000 BBC Weather underwent a more significant change. Whilst there was not much change to the existing weather symbols new symbols giving information Pollen and Sun levels were introduced. A new more detailed map of Britain was used based on satellite data.\nToday.\n16 May 2005 saw the end of the weather symbols on television after 29 years and 9 months on air. They were replaced by a controversial format as the forecast underwent another redesign, with the flat map replaced by a 3D globe, and weather conditions shown by coloured areas. Cloud cover is indicated by the brightness of the map, while rain and snow are indicated by animated blue and white areas respectively.\nThe graphics are provided by Weatherscape XT, which was developed by the commercial arm of the New Zealand Metservice.\nThe move polarised opinion; some saw it as more accurate and modern, while others disliked the brown colour chosen for the landmass and the presumed high cost of the graphics. Poor angling of the map, in order to show the curvature of the Earth, led to Scotland appearing little larger than Devon, and Shetland being almost invisible while exaggerating London and the South East. This led to many Scottish commentators claiming the BBC was guilty of a London bias. As a result, the map was realigned, and the moving tour of the UK was lengthened.\nThe new look won a prestigious Silver Award at the Promax/BDA Awards in 2006. Criticism has been ongoing however, with some viewers complaining about the colour scheme, and of a lack of detail beyond 36 hours.\nThere have been continuous developments since May 2005. In 2006, a rippling effect was introduced to define seas and oceans.\nOnline forecasts.\nThe BBC Weather website provides outlook weather forecasts for UK and international locations using animated symbols and a format similar in design to that used for the televised broadcasts.\nThe website also runs frequent special features about seasonal sports, White Christmas, nature and meteorological science. It also has world weather, UK outlook and weather news. A new beta weather site is currently being developed, to fit in with the rest of the BBC site style."}

Its taste is detectable in concentrations as low as 1 ppm.\nBetween 30 and 120\u00a0mg can kill an adult human. Strychnine is rapidly absorbed by the mucous membranes. If it is given under the skin, or intravenously, a quantity of 15\u00a0mg may be enough to kill an adult. Benzodiazepines (such as Diazepam) are used by default for emergency treatment.\nUnlike the illustrations given in fiction crime novels, Strychnine is not very good for killing someone (when given orally). This is because even diluted at 1:130.000 it can still be tasted. Despite this, some murders happened with Strychnine. Thomas Neill Cream, a serial killer, used it on some of his victims.\nBecause of its high toxicity and tendency to cause convulsions, the use of strychnine in medicine was eventually abandoned once safer alternatives became available."}

The bark of the Cinchona family of trees contains quinine. Quinine can be made artificially, but this is more expensive than extracting it from the bark of the tree. This tree is found in the Andes, South America, Indonesia, and Congo.\nQuinine was the first treatment for malaria, known from 1631 in Europe, and probably much earlier to the native peoples of South America. Even today, quinine is used to treat certain forms of malaria, when other drugs fail or are unavailable. In that way, quinine is currently one of the best treatments for \"malaria tropica\", which is caused by plasmodium falciparum. For the other forms of malaria, quinine is no longer used, as other drugs have replaced it.\nHistory.\nQuinine relaxes muscles, and was used by the Inca of Peru to stop people from shivering. Europeans first reported using quinine against malaria in Rome in 1631.\nThe best type of quinine used to treat malaria was found by Charles Marie de La Condamine in 1737. Quinine helped Europeans colonize Africa. A historian said that \"it was quinine ... that gave colonists fresh opportunities to swarm into the Gold Coast, Nigeria and other parts of west Africa\".\nSide effects.\nQuinine can cause cinchonism and even death (usually by pulmonary oedema) in some cases. Quinine can make someone paralyzed if it is injected into a nerve. It is very toxic in overdose.\nCurrent uses.\nQuinine has a bitter taste. It was first added to drinks like Bitter Lemon and Tonic Water Quinine was added to have some protection against Malaria. In China, it is sometimes added to drugs against the Common cold. Quinine is also often used to add a bitter taste to food. Usually this has to be declared though. Quinine can also stimulate the muscles of the uterus. For this reason, pregnant women should not take too much of it. Sometimes it is used in combination with Heroin."}

Human hands are chiral. The left hand is a mirror image of the right hand. You cannot turn or move one of your hands to look exactly the same as the other. This is why you can not put a left handed glove on your right hand, or shake the right hand of a person using your left hand.\nIn chemistry.\nIn chemistry, chirality refers to molecules. If a molecule is chiral it has two forms that are mirror images of each other but \"otherwise identical\".\nChemists call these \"enantiomers\" or \"optical isomers\". Because the difference between right and left hands is easy to understand, chemists call enantiomers either 'right-' or 'left-handed'. A mixture of equal amounts of the two enantiomers is called a \"racemic mixture\".\nMolecular chirality is quite common. It is found in stereochemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry.\nThe symmetry of a molecule (or any other object) tells us whether it is chiral. A molecule is \"achiral\" (not chiral) if it has an axis of symmetry.\nRacemic mixtures.\nA racemic mixture is one which has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule.\nHomochiralism in biology.\nMany biologically active molecules are chiral, including amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and sugars. Most of these compounds are of the same chirality. Most amino acids are (left-handed) and sugars are . (right-handed). Proteins made of amino acids, are known as \"left-handed proteins\", whereas amino acids produce \"right-handed proteins\".\nThe origin of homochirality in the first place is much discussed. Most believe that the original origin of chiralities was purely random. They think if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, the chemistry might have different chirality. Other theories are possible.\nEnzymes, which are chiral, usually only work with one enantiomer of a chiral substrate. Imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.\nIt was economical for life-forms to adopt one form or the other of each type of chiral compound. That way we do not need two enzymes for every chemical reaction which involves chirality."}

This is usually done to add to the overall image effect or to hide something (such as when a different face is superimposed over the original face in a photograph). \nThis technique is used in cartography to produce photomaps by superimposing grid lines, contour lines and other linear or textual mapping features over aerial photographs.\nSuperimposition of 2D images containing correlated periodic grid structures may produce moir\u00e9 patterns. Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line moir\u00e9 patterns. The movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moir\u00e9 superimposition image. Such optical acceleration is known as moir\u00e9 speedup (check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns). When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines, at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moir\u00e9 patterns, namely line Glass patterns (after Leon Glass, 1969) appear. Similarly, when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns, namely random dot moir\u00e9, appears. When one of the layers embeds complex shapes, such as sequences of symbols forming a text, and another layer contains parallel lines or curves, the superimposition image may gives rise to magnified shapes, called shape moir\u00e9 patterns."}

(Some sources give \"by ignorance of the issues\" or even \"by ignoring the issues\" as a translation of ignoratio elenchi.)\nAristotle believed that an ignoratio elenchi is a mistake made by a questioner while attempting to falsify a respondent's argument. He called it an ignorance of what makes for a refutation. For Aristotle, ignoratio elenchi amounts to \"ignorance of logic\". In fact, Aristotle goes so far as to say that all logical fallacies can be reduced to what he calls ignoratio elenchi.\nModern use limits this term much more narrowly to the kind of mistake described in the first paragraph above.\nRed herring.\nSimilar to ignoratio elenchi, a \"red herring\" is an argument, given in reply, that does not address the original issue. Critically, a red herring is a \"deliberate\" attempt to change the subject or divert the argument. This is known formally in the English vocabulary as digression which is a neutrally connotated \"Red herring\". The actual problem is eclipsed by the process of re-focusing on something else.\nExamples.\nMaher: It's arbitrary, isn't it? If you had been born in Pakistan, you wouldn't be believing in Jesus Christ. You would have been told another fairy tale and you would have been believing that.\nScarborough: Well, Bill, that's your opinion.\n\"Whether Maher's argument is his opinion or not is irrelevant and does not address the argument made.\"\n\"The conclusion is ignoratio elenchi, since friendliness and charity are not the main qualifications for induction into the Hall of Fame.\"\n\"The existence of worse criminals is a secondary issue which has no bearing on whether the driver deserves a fine for recklessness. If the speaker were deliberately attempting to divert the issue, this would be an example of a red herring. While the argument about how the police should spend their time may have merit, the question of whom the police should prioritize pursuing and the question of what should be done with those the police have caught are separate questions.\"\n\"A red herring, the unrelated alleged affair, attempts to change the subject away from the popular policies. However, if the original discussion were of the prime minister's public integrity (encompassing both popularity and conduct), this argument could be perfectly valid. Such as if a politician's election campaign revolved around family values. Then an argument about such an affair would be valid, as it is in direct conflict with a family values platform.\""}

Informal fallacies often come about because of an error in reasoning. The premises are then incorrectly linked to the conclusion. \nIn contrast to a formal fallacy, the error has to do with issues of inference. Because language is used to state the propositions, natural language allows one to say more than formal logic can represent. All informal fallacies of deductive reasoning contain a disconnect between the premises and the conclusion. This makes the argument invalid. The disconnect happens because there is a hidden co-premise. If this co-premise were \"stated\", it would make the argument valid.\nInductive \"informal\" fallacies are rather different from their deductive counterparts. Their merit rests in the inductive strength of the premiseconclusion link, not the presence of hidden premises. For instance, the fallacy of hasty generalization, can be roughly stated as:\nIf the populations of \"P\" and \"Q\" are both too large to sample completely, then the statement is inductive. In such a case, a hasty generalization occurs when the number of \"P\"s and \"Q\"s does not represent the respective populations. It is important to distinguish between a principle of reasoning (deductive or inductive) and the premise of an argument."}

This kind of harm is not suicidal behavior. Many self-harmers hurt themselves because they feel it is the only way to stay alive. However, in some cases the self-harm becomes so bad it can lead to death, and those who self-harm are more likely to commit suicide than those who do not.\nThere are many different reasons why a person may hurt themselves, though it is often hard to find an exact cause. Sometimes, the self-harm helps relieve unbearable emotions, or feelings of unreality or numbness. Self-harm is often a symptom of other problems. These problems may include physical abuse, sexual abuse, or eating disorders. Self-harm may also stem from mental problems such as low self esteem or perfectionism.\nStudying the causes of self-injury can be difficult or inaccurate, because many self-harmers try to hide their injuries.\nTypes of self-injury.\nSelf-injury is a general term that includes many different types of deliberate harm to the body. There are many things that can be considered self-harm. If someone works their body too hard, for example, this can be seen as a mild form of self-injury. In other mild cases, a self-harmer may purposely pick off scabs to keep cuts or scratches from healing. Compulsive hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and compulsive skin-picking (dermotillomania) are impulse control disorders which are also mild forms of self-harm. \nIn more severe cases, a self-harmer could break or sprain a bone, or lose a dangerous amount of blood. Biting, burning, and cutting are other forms of self-injury. Overdosing on medication is another common type of self-harm.\nSelf-harm may get worse the longer a person has been doing it. This is because a person's body builds up tolerance to (gets used to) the pain from their injuries. Because of this, they have to hurt themselves more to get the same effect. In some cases, this can lead to fatal or near-fatal injuries.\nA person may go through voluntary pain for other reasons that are usually not considered self-injury. A self-inflicted wound is when someone injures themselves to avoid something, not because of psychological problems. Some people give themselves a self-inflicted wound during wartime so that they do not have to serve in the military.\nSome people go through pain to change the way they look, such as in ear piercing. This is called body modification. Body modification is not a form of self-injury. \nScarification is a type of body modification where someone cuts or burns their skin for decoration. This can include branding, which is common in some fraternities. It can also include cutting the skin repeatedly in a pattern or design. This will create very large scars. Some African tribes use scarification as a symbol of beauty and strength.\nSelf-injury in the population.\nExperts estimate that about 1% of the population has self-harmed. While people of all ages and ethnic groups have self-harmed, some groups are more likely to self-harm than others. Age, gender, and race can be factors in the risk of self-injury. Some evidence suggests that self-injury is also more common in people who have a family history of suicide or self-injury.\nAge.\nIn general, more young people are treated for self-injury than any other age group. According to one Australian study 30% of teenagers say they have self-injured. It is more widespread among those with mental illness. One in four (25%) of teenagers with mental illnesses have self-harmed. Self-harm in females is most common between the ages of 15-24. Males are most likely to self-harm through the ages 25-34.\nRecent research focusing on young people suggests that 10 percent of 15 to 16 year olds have self-harmed. In this case, the self-harm was usually done by cutting.\nGender.\nA study in Oxford in the year 2000 found that approximately 300 per 100,000 (0.3%) of males aged between 15 and 24 years, and 700 per 100,000 (0.7%) of females of the same age, were admitted into a hospital after self-harming. Based on statistics like these, most agree that young white females are most likely to self-injure. Possibly because of this, it is usually believed that women have higher rates of self-harm than men. However, this may not be true because women are more likely to get help for their self-injury. Males may have the same or similar rates of self-injury as women. Some findings have even suggested that in the mid-30s age range, more men are treated for self-harm than women.\nDiscrimination.\nMinority groups who face discrimination are also more likely to self-injure. If someone is bullied because they are different (for example, because of their race, ethnicity or sexual orientation), this can lead to low self-esteem and a feeling of helplessness over emotions. This can lead some people to self-harm.\nPersonal history.\nStudies have show that those who have been abused are more likely to self-injure. Sexual abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse can cause low self-esteem, especially in children. It can also cause other emotional problems. Some people may turn to self-harm to relieve these emotions. Low self-esteem in victims of abuse may lead them to believe that the abuse was their fault. They may turn to self-injury because of this.\nUnstable living conditions such as unemployment or divorce may also make a person more likely to self-harm.\nPrisoners are also more likely to self-harm. This may be because of the ongoing trauma that happens in prisons, including sexual and physical violence and intimidation. In an environment such as prison, where options for inmates are limited, prisoners may turn to self-injury. In England and Wales, a report from The Howard League says that over 22,000 prisoners harmed themselves in 2007.\nThose with learning and developmental disabilities such as autism are more likely to self-harm. The cause of this is unclear. Some case studies have shown that it may be a form of self-stimulation. It may be that autistic children who self-harm are trying to express frustration that they cannot explain with words. Autistic children who self-harm may do so by head-banging or biting.\nTreatment.\nSelf-harm is an addictive behaviour. Once someone starts self-injury, it is difficult for them to stop, even if they want to. This makes professional help and treatment an important part of recovery from self-injury.\nThe type of treatment that is most effective is different from person to person. There are many different types of therapy that have been used to help people that self-harm.\nCognitive-behavioural therapy may help a person understand why they self-harm. Cognitive-behavioural therapy is used to help patients understand the reasons for their problem. This is so that the patient may learn what is causing their self-harm, and learn how to deal with these problems in a way other than self-harm.\nTherapies used for post-traumatic stress disorder may also help. This is because many people who self-harm have been victims of abuse. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR) is an example of this.\nDrugs may also be used to help treat self-injury. It is thought that self-injury can release chemical endorphins into the brain. Over time, these chemicals can become addictive. There are some drugs that can help with this addiction, but they have not been proven to help people who self-injure. Naltrexone and naloxone are two drugs being researched for this kind of treatment. Research involving endorphins has been mostly done with animals. It is unclear if their brain chemistry changes the outcome of the research."}

No writing by Socrates survives. \nSocrates was famous for not answering questions in a direct manner. \"I know that I know nothing\", he said. Socrates's stated position (as presented in Plato's dialogues) was that other person already knew the answer to a question. He (S.) only drew out what was already in the other's mind. \nIn Plato's early dialogues, the \"elenchus\" is the technique Socrates uses to investigate ethical concepts, such as justice or virtue. According to one scholar, it has the following steps:\nThe exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate. In particular, whether it is a positive method leading to knowledge, or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge.\nAccording to W.K.C. Guthrie, the Socratic method was intended to demonstrate one's ignorance. Socrates, unlike the Sophists, did believe that knowledge was possible, but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one's ignorance. Guthrie writes, \"[Socrates] was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything, and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance, while they were not. The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something, in fact he does not\"."}

At that time, he was Born's assistant, working with quantum mechanics.\nAfter his studies of mathematics, physics, and geography in Marburg and G\u00f6ttingen, he worked as a private lecturer in theoretical physics at G\u00f6ttingen in 1925, professor at Rostock in 1927, Leipzig in 1929, Jena in 1946, Frankfurt/Main in 1951 and from 1957 again in G\u00f6ttingen. Additionally he stayed in Copenhagen (1926) with Niels Bohr and lectured on the atom at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1928.\nOn the occasion of his 100th birthday, the book: Friedrich Hund: Geschichte der physikalischen Begriffe [history of physics terms] (Heidelberg, Berlin, Oxford), Spektrum, Akademie Verlag 1996, was published. A review was also written by Werner Kutzelnigg.\nFriedrich Hund became an honorary citizen of Jena, and a street in Jena was named after him. Since June 2004, a part of the new building of the Physics Department was given the Friedrich-Hund-Platz 1 address. The same name was chosen for the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\nHunds cases.\nThe Hund's cases, which are particular regimes in molecular angular momentum coupling, and the Hund's rules, which govern electron configurations, are important in spectroscopy and quantum chemistry. In chemistry, the first of Hund's rules is especially important and is often referred to as simply Hund's rule."}

They often use strings or other means to make the puppet move and look alive. Some puppets are very simple, but others are more complicated and need skill to use. The person who works the puppet and makes it move is called a puppeteer. The audience cannot usually see this person but some, like a ventriloquist and dummy, are in full view of the audience. There are many different types of puppets to be found around the world. Puppetry is a special art form that is very important in some cultures.\nTypes of puppets.\nFinger Puppet: A very simple type of puppet where the puppet is placed on a finger and worked by moving the finger. \nSock puppet: A sock or similar garment worn as a glove, with the thumb acting as a jaw. \nHand Puppet: Similar to a finger puppet, but larger. The puppeteer uses his or her fingers and hand to work the puppet. Punch and Judy are famous glove puppets.\nPop-up puppets: A cone with a rod through and a puppet inside. When the rod is pushed up, the puppet appears.\nPaddle Puppet: The puppet is on the end of a paddle. When the puppeteer steps on the paddles back end the other end lifts up, making it seem that the puppet moves by itself.\nJumping Jack: A puppet where the arms and legs of the puppet are joined to a string. When the string is pulled down, the arms and legs go up.\nRod Puppet and Bunraku: The puppet is worked with rods joined to the puppets arms and legs, while another puppeteer moves the head and sometimes the mouth. Bunraku is a special type of Japanese rod puppetry.\nShadow Puppet: Another very simple puppet. A cut out figure on a rod is held in front of a light. Its shadow is projected onto a screen. The puppeteer moves the puppet around, giving it some life. Sometimes coloured paper is used to give a certain amount of colour to the puppet.\nMarionette or String Puppet: This puppet is moved around with strings that hang from above the theatre. This is one of the more complex types of puppetry and is hard to master as some marionettes can have up to thirty strings.\nVentriloquist Figure or Dummy: This puppet is one of the few where the audience sees the puppeteer. The puppeteer moves the puppets head arms and mouth with his hands as well as with levers. The performance usually takes the shape of a conversation between the dummy and the puppeteer. The puppeteer speaks normally, then puts on a different voice when the puppet is supposed to be talking. His voice seems to be coming from his stomach (Latin: \"venter\"). His lips are not moving, but the puppet's lips may move, so it seems as if the puppet is talking.\nTicklebug: A type of Hand Puppet; a person uses their fingers as body parts to look like their hand is an animal. The center finger becomes the animal's head, the first and third fingers become the front legs, and the thumb and last finger are used as back legs."}

They probably descended from the gracile australopithecine \"Australopithecus\".\nDescription.\nAll species of \"Paranthropus\" were bipedal, and many lived during a time when species of the genus \"Homo\", such as \"Homo ergaster\" and \"Homo erectus\", were living.\n\"Paranthropus\" first appeared roughly 2.7 million years ago. Most species of \"Paranthropus\" had a brain about 40 percent of the size of modern man. There was some size variation between the different species of \"Paranthropus\", but most stood roughly 1.3-1.4 m (4.26 to 4.59 feet) tall and were quite well muscled. \"Paranthropus\" is thought to have lived in wooded areas rather than the grasslands of the \"Australopithecus\".\n\"Australopithecus\" and \"Paranthropus\" also looked very different from each other. These differences were only found in remains of the skull. The other parts of the skeleton were still very similar, so it is reasonable to think the difference was an adaptation to different food. \"Paranthropus\" was more massively built as to skull and teeth. It often had gorilla-like sagittal crests on the cranium which anchored massive temporalis muscles for chewing.\nBehaviour.\n\"Paranthropus\" did not behave in the same way as \"Homo\". They lived on a diet of heavy-duty plant material: leaves, slim branches, grass, roots. The diet might be supplemented with insect grubs. Lacking our flexible behaviour, \"Paranthropus\" relied on the steady environmental conditions of the tropical forest. Members of the genus \"Homo\", such as \"Homo habilis\", had proportionately larger brains and more flexible behaviour. They were able to eat a much wider variety of foods.\nDisputed taxonomy.\nOpinions differ whether the species \"P. aethiopicus, P. boisei\" and \"P. robustus\" should be included within the genus \"Australopithecus\". On Wikipedia, the genus \"Paranthropus\" is used for all articles which mention the species \"P. aethiopicus, P. boisei\" and \"P. robustus\".\nOccurrence.\nFor the most part the \"Australopithecus\" species \"A. afarensis\", \"A. africanus\", and \"A. anamensis\" either disappeared from the fossil record before the appearance of early humans or seem to have been the ancestors of \"Homo habilis\". \"P. boisei\" and \"P. aethiopicus\", on the other hand, continued to evolve along a separate path distinct and unrelated to early humans. \"Paranthropus\" shared the earth with some early examples of the \"Homo\" genus, such as \"H. habilis\", \"H. ergaster\", and possibly even \"H. erectus\".\nIntelligence.\nSpecies of \"Paranthropus\" had smaller braincases than \"Homo\", yet they had significantly larger braincases than \"Australopithecus\". Paranthropus is associated with stone tools both in southern and eastern Africa, although there is considerable debate whether they were made and utilized by these robust australopithecines. Most believe that early \"Homo\" was the tool maker. Most \"Paranthropus\" species almost certainly did not have language or to have controlled fire, although they are directly associated with the latter at Swartkrans, South Africa.\nDiscovery.\nA partial cranium and mandible of \"Paranthropus robustus\" was discovered in 1938 by a schoolboy, 70\u00a0km south west of Pretoria in South Africa. It was described as a new genus and species by Robert Broom of the Transvaal Museum. A date of at least 1.95 million years has been obtained for the site.\n\"Paranthropus boisei\" was discovered by Mary Leakey in July 1959 at the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Mary was working alone, as Louis was ill in camp. She rushed back to camp and at the news Louis made a remarkable recovery.\nIn his notes Louis recorded a first name, \"Titanohomo mirabilis\", reflecting an initial impression of close human affinity. Louis and Mary began to call it \"Dear Boy\". Recovery was halted on August 7. Dear Boy was in context with Oldowan tools and animal bones.\nThe fossil was published in \"Nature\" on 15 August 1959, but due to a strike of the printers the issue was not released until September. In it Louis placed the fossil in Broom's Australopithecinae family, creating a new genus for it, \"Zinjanthropus\", species \"boisei\". \"Zinj\" is an ancient Arabic word for the coast of East Africa and \"boisei\" referred to Charles Boise, an anthropological benefactor of the Leakeys. Louis based his classification on twenty differences from Australopithecus.\nBroom had died in 1951 but Dart was still living. He is said to have wept for joy on Louis' behalf on being personally shown Zinj, which Louis and Mary carried around in a tin (later a box). Louis had considered Broom's \"Paranthropus\" genus, but rejected it because he believed Zinj was in the \"Homo\" ancestral stock but Paranthropus was not. He relied heavily on the larger size of Zinj's canines.\nThe battle of the name raged on for many years and drove a wedge between Louis and LeGros Clark, who took the \"Paranthropus\" view. On the other hand it brought the Leakeys and Dr. Melville Bell Grosvenor of the National Geographic Society together. The Leakeys became international figures and had no trouble finding funds from then on. The Zinj question ultimately became part of the \"Australopithecus\"/\"Paranthropus\" question (which only applied to the robust Australopithecines)."}

It is usually measured in millimetres and inches. Rain gauge is a meteorological instrument for determining the depth of precipitation (usually in mm) that occurs over a unit area (usually one metre square) and thus measuring rainfall amount. One millimetre of measured precipitation is the equivalent to one litre of rainfall per metre square. \nUsually a tapering funnel of copper or polyester of standard dimension allows the rain water to collect in an enclosed bottle or cylinder for subsequent measurement. The gauge is set in open ground with the funnel rim up to 30 cm above the ground surface. Some gauges are calibrated to allow the amount of rainfall to be read directly; with others it must be calculated from the depth of water in the container and the dimensions of the funnel.\nThe second type of rain gauge is the autographic gauge which can be either of the tilting-siphon type or the tipping-bucket type. The recording chart on an autographic rain gauge is mounted on a drum which is driven by clockwork and typically rotates round a vertical axis once per day. For a tilting-siphon rain gauge, the rainwater in a collector displaces a float so that a marking pen attached to the float makes a continuous trace on the paper. The two buckets in a tipping-bucket rain gauge rest on a pivot so that when one bucket has received 0.2 (or 0.5 mm) of rain it tips by gravity, empties the rainwater and allows the other bucket to start collection. During the tip, an electrical switch is closed and triggers a nearby autographic recorder to register each 'tilt', thus giving a fairly continuous record of precipitation and, in a more sophisticated form, even rainfall intensity. Rain gauges must be sited in as representative a location as possible, but the choice of location is difficult, since many precipitation events are highly aggregate. King Sejong the Great was the man who introduced rain gauge to the world. There are advantages and disadvantages of this instrument."}

However, radio stations in Seattle played Smells Like Teen Spirit, and it became a hit.

{"id": "133758", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133758", "title": "George Sand", "text": "Amandine \"Aurore\" Lucile Dupin, later Baroness (French:\"baronne\") Dudevant (1 July 1804 \u2013 8 June 1876), best known by her pseudonym George\u00a0Sand (), was a French novelist and feminist.\nEarly life.\nSand's father, Maurice Dupin, was the grandson of the Marshall General of France, Maurice, Comte de Saxe. He was also a distant relative of Louis XVI. Her mother, Sophie-Victoire Delaborde was a common woman. Sand was born in Paris. She spent much of her childhood with her grandmother, Marie Aurore de Saxe, Madame Dupin de Franceuil. Her grandmother lived in her estate, Nohant, in the French region of Berry. She later used the setting in many of her novels. In 1822, at age 19, she married Baron Casimir Dudevant (1795\u20131871), illegitimate son of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois. She and Dudevant had two children: Maurice (1823\u20131889) and Solange (1828\u20131899). In early 1831 she left her prosaic husband and entered upon a four- or five-year period of \"romantic rebellion.\" In 1835 she was legally separated from Dudevant.\nHow other people who lived at the time saw her.\nSand started to wear men's clothes in public. This harmed her reputation. She said that men's clothes were tougher, and also less expensive to buy than women's. The clothes she wore were comfortable, and they also allowed her to go around Paris more freely than the other women, even those of her own social standing.\nSand also smoked in public. This led to a scandal. At her time, women were not supposed to smoke, not even those of her standing. Franz Liszt had a relationship with a woman called Marie D'Agoult, who did this as well. D'Argoult smoked large cigars. These and other behaviors were exceptional for a woman of the early and mid-19th century, when social codes\u2013especially in the upper classes\u2013were very important.\nPoet Charles Baudelaire was a contemporary critic of George Sand: \"She is stupid, heavy and garrulous. Her ideas on morals have the same depth of judgment and delicacy of feeling as those of janitresses and kept women... The fact that there are men who could become enamoured of this slut is indeed a proof of the abasement of the men of this generation.\"\nRelationships.\nSand had affairs with several men. Some lasted longer, others shorter. These men included Jules Sandeau (1831), Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Alfred de Musset (summer 1833 \u2013 March 1834), Louis-Chrystosome Michel, Charles Didier, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Bocage, F\u00e9licien Mallefille and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (1837\u201347).\nLater in life, she wrote letters to Gustave Flaubert. Despite their obvious differences in temperament and aesthetic preference, they eventually became good friends.\nShe was engaged in an intimate friendship with actress Marie Dorval, which led to widespread but unconfirmed rumors of a lesbian affair.\nIn Majorca one can still visit the (then abandoned) Carthusian monastery of Valldemossa, where she spent the winter of 1838\u201339 with Chopin and her children. This trip to Majorca was described by her in \"Un Hiver \u00e0 Majorque\" (A Winter in Majorca), published in 1855.\nChopin left her two years before his death, because of a family disturbance wherein he supported her daughter Solange's marriage choice, which had caused Sand to disown the daughter.\nWriting career.\nA liaison with the writer Jules Sandeau heralded her literary debut. They published a few stories in collaboration, signing them \"Jules Sand.\" She consequently adopted, for her first independent novel, \"Indiana\" (1832), the pen name that made her famous \u2013 George Sand.\nHer first published novel, \"Rose et Blanche\" (1831), was written in collaboration with Jules Sandeau.\nDrawing from her childhood experiences of the countryside, she wrote the rural novels \"La Mare au Diable\" (1846), \"Fran\u00e7ois le Champi\" (1847\u20131848), \"La Petite Fadette\" (1849), and \"Les Beaux Messieurs Bois-Dor\u00e9\" (1857). \"A Winter in Majorca\" described the period that she and Chopin spent on that island in 1838-9.\nHer other novels include \"Indiana\" (1832), \"L\u00e9lia\" (1833), \"Mauprat\" (1837), \"Le Compagnon du Tour de France\" (1840), \"Consuelo\" (1842\u20131843), and \"Le Meunier d'Angibault\" (1845).\nFurther theatre pieces and autobiographical pieces include \"Histoire de ma vie\" (1855), \"Elle et Lui\" (1859) (about her affair with Musset), \"Journal Intime\" (posthumously published in 1926), and \"Correspondence\". Sand often performed her theatrical works in her small private theatre at the Nohant estate.\nIn addition, Sand authored literary criticism and political texts. Her most widely used quote being, \"There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved.\"\nShe was known well in far reaches of the world, and her social practices, her writings and her beliefs prompted much commentary, often by other luminaries in the world of arts and letters. A few excerpts demonstrate much of what was often said about George Sand:\nDeath.\nGeorge Sand died at Nohant, near Ch\u00e2teauroux, in France's Indre \"d\u00e9partement\" on 8 June 1876, at the age of 71 and was buried in the grounds of her home there. In 2004, controversial plans were suggested to move her remains to the Panth\u00e9on in Paris.\nIn literature.\nFrequent literary references to George Sand can be found in \"\" (1990) by A. S. Byatt. The American poet Walt Whitman cited Sand's novel \"Consuelo\" as a personal favorite and the sequel to this novel \"La Comtesse De Rudolstady\" contains at least a couple of passages that appear to have had a very direct influence on him. Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861), the English poet, produced two poems \"To George Sand: A Desire\" and \"To George Sand: A Recognition\". The character, Stepan Verkhovensky, in Dostoevsky's novel \"The Possessed\" took to translating the works of George Sand in his periodical, before the periodical was subsequently seized by the ever-cautious Russian government of the 1840s. George Sand is referenced a number of times in the play \"Voyage\", the first part of Tom Stoppard's \"The Coast of Utopia\" trilogy. And, in the first episode of the \"Overture\" to \"Swann's Way\" - the first novel in Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\" sequence - a young, distraught Marcel is calmed by his mother as she reads from \"Fran\u00e7ois le Champi\", a novel which it is explained was part of a birthday package from his grandmother which also included \"La Mare au Diable,\" \"La Petite Fadette,\" and \"Les Ma\u00eetres Sonneurs.\" As with many episodes involving art in \"\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu\", this reminiscence includes commentary on the work."}

Escherichia coli, Fruit flies, and mice are often used for animal testing. About 50 to 100 million vertebrate animals and many more invertebrate animals are used around the world every year. The source of the animals are different according to the country and species. Most animals used for experiments are bred for this purpose. But others may be caught from the wild or bought from people who buy them from animal shelters.\nAnimals are used for experiments inside universities, medical schools, farms, large companies and other places that provide animal-testing services. People who support animal testing argue that almost every medical discovery in the 20th century used animals in some way. They say that even complex computers cannot model connections between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment. Many important discoveries were made because of animal testing. But some scientists and animal rights organizations such as PETA do not support animal testing. They say that it is cruel, poorly done, and costly. Others argue that animals have the right not to be used for experiments, and that model organisms are different from humans. The limits to animal testing is different in various countries.\nDefinitions.\nThe words animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, \"in vitro\" testing, and vivisection have similar meanings,differently. \"tatiosion\" means to \"cut up\" a living animal. It was used only in experiments that dissected live animals. The word \"vivisection\" is sometimes used negatively about any experiment with live animals. For example, the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" described \"vivisection\" as: \"Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals\". However, dictionaries note that the wider definition is \"used only by people who are opposed (dislike) to such work\". The word makes people think of torture, pain, and death. People who dislike animal testing often use the word \"vivisection\", while scientists usually use the expression \"animal experimentation\" instead.\nHistory.\nThe earliest mention of animal testing is in the writings of the Greeks in the second and fourth centuries BCE. Aristotle (\u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2) (384 \u2013 322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304 \u2013 258 BCE) where some of the first people to try out experiments on living animals. Galen, a doctor in second-century Rome who was known as the \"father of vivisection\", dissected pigs and goats. Avenzoar, an Arabic doctor in twelfth-century Spain, tested out surgical processes on animals before applying them to humans.\nAnimals have often been used in the history of scientific study. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur showed the germ theory of medicine by putting anthrax in sheep. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. On November 3, 1957, a Russian dog, Laika, became the first animal to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were made using armadillos, then given to humans. In 1974, Rudolf Jaenisch produced the first genetically changed mammal. He put DNA from a virus into the genome of mice. Genetic study grew quickly after that. In 1996, Dolly the sheep was born\u2014the first cloned mammal.\nIn the 20th century, toxicology testing became important. In the 19th century, laws about drugs were less strict. Drugs did not have to be checked for safety. But in 1937, a drug called Elixir Sulfanilamide killed more than 100 people. They caused great and long lasting pain, vomiting, and fits. After that, the U.S. congress made laws that said that drugs had to be tested on animals before they could be sold. Other countries passed similar laws.\nEven back in the 17th century, people disagreed about animal testing. In 1655, Edmund O'Meara said that \"the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state.\" O'Meara and others said that animals could be affected by pain during vivisection, making results unreliable. Others also disliked animal testing because they felt that animals should not be hurt for humans. Others opposed animal testing for different reasons: many believed that animals were not as good as humans and that they were so different that results of animal testing would not work on humans.\nSupporters had different views. They argued that experiments on animals were necessary for knowledge. Claude Bernard, the \"prince of vivisectors\" and the father of physiology famously wrote in 1865 that \"the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly (brightly) lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen\". He declared that \"experiments on entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree\". Because of Bernard, animal testing became a regular scientific method. Surprisingly, though, his wife, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Martin, began the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883.\nIn 1896, Dr. Walter B. Cannon said, \u201cThe antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, \u2018Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden (servant) of crime.\u2019 \u201d The public first began giving its attention to the supporters and opposers of animal testing during the brown dog affair in the early 1990s. In the brown dog affair, hundreds of medical students and anti-vivisectionists and police argued over a memorial to a vivisected dog."}

It has been practiced at least since the eighth century BC. Homer wrote about it in his poem \"Iliad\". At that time, Greece was made of many city-states that were independent. Each city state seems to have had its own version of the sport.\nToday, most of the sources that talk about Greek boxing are either legends, or they are fragmentary. When a source is fragmentary, this means that part of the text has been lost, or is missing. This makes it difficult to find the rules, or where and how the activity was done. Several details are missing, but it seems boxing with gloves was an important part of the Greek athletic culture of the time.\nWhere it came from.\nThe activity was called \"pyx\" or \"pygme\" in Ancient Greek. Archeologists have found evidence that this activity was probably done by the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. Many legends tell about the origins of boxing in Greece. One legend says that the heroic ruler Theseus invented a type of boxing where two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed. Later, the boxers began to fight while standing. They also started to wear gloves (with spikes) and wrappings on their arms below the elbows. In Ancient Greece, most sports were done naked, boxing too. \nAccording to \"Iliad\", Mycenaean warriors included boxing in their competitions. They did this to honor those who had died. It is possible that Homer told about what the Greeks did, at a later time. Boxing was one of the contests held in memory of Achilles' friend Patroclus, who was killed toward the end of the Trojan War. To commemorate Patroclus the Greeks later introduced boxing (\"pygme / pygmachia\") to the Olympic Games in 688 BC. People taking part trained on punching bags (called a \"korykos\"). Fighters wore leather straps (called \"himantes\") over their hands, wrists, and sometimes chest, to protect themselves from injury. The straps also left the fingers free. \nPhilostratus was a scholar and an historian. According to him, boxing was originally developed in Sparta, in order to harden warriors\u2019 faces for battle. The early Spartans believed helmets were unnecessary and boxing prepared them for when they were hit on the head in battle. However, Spartans never took part in the competitive version of boxing. They thought it was dishonorable to be defeated that way. \nEquipment.\nUntil around 500 BC \"himantes\" were used as protection for the knuckles and hand. They were thongs of ox hide between 3 and 3.7 meters long. The \"himantes\" were wrapped around the hands and knuckles many times.\nAround 400 BC \"sphairai\" were introduced. The \"sphairai\" were very similar to \"himantes\". The biggest difference was that the inside was padded when they were wrapped around the hands. The outside of the thong was more rigid too.\nSoon after the \"saphirai\" had been introduced, they were replaced by \"oxys\" used for boxing. \"Oxys\" were made of several thick leather bands that were wrapped around the hand, wrist, and forearm. A band of fleece was placed on the forearm to wipe away sweat. Leather braces extended up the forearm to give greater support when punching. The knuckles were reinforced with leather as well.\n\"Korykos\" were the equivalent to modern punching bags. They were used for practice in the Palaestra and were filled with sand, flour, or millet.\nRules.\nThe rules currently used for the sport are based on the old rules. As pointed out above, there are only incomplete sources for the rules. The rules needed to be deduced from old texts and images:"}

He thought that forms of government like socialism were not good for the economy, and damaged freedom of the individual. Hayek's signature work, \"The Road to Serfdom\", refers to the consequences of socialism.\nHe was one of the most important economists and political philosophers of the 20th century.

The award was for their work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations; also for their analysis of the inter-dependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. He also received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991. He is thought to be one of the major causes of change from the Keynesian policies of the first part of the 20th century.

It is believed both of these formed from melting of the snow and ice that cover the summit, as did the original eruption. \nPre-eruptive activity.\nNevado del Ruiz was very active in the three months before it erupted. An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from the fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct magmatic release into surface environment. A very high lahar risk was stressed in the mission's report delivered on October 22, 1985 and various simple preparedness techniques were proposed to local authorities.\nDuring the following \"quiet\" period in October, the hydrothermal component of the vapor discharge steadily increased. The gases were super-saturated with elemental sulfur; their thermodynamic equilibration temperatures can range from 200 to 600\u00b0 Celsius. Gases and water from fumaroles and thermal springs on the flanks of the volcano are likely to be produced from a two-phase vapor-brine envelope adjoining the eruptive system within the volcano. The chemistry of the fumarole discharges is compatible with the comparison of an eruptive mechanism involving the build-up of pressure in an extensive vapor zone by gas released from a stagnant, already extensively degassed body of magmatic material at depth. Production of such a residual gas over extended periods may account for the large amount of sulfur dioxide (SO) being released from the volcano in relation to the small amount of ejected solids.\nThe destruction wrought by the 1985 eruption was partially due to the fact that scientists vacillated over whether or not to evacuate the area. Nevertheless, a group of scientists informed them that they faced eminent and almost certain death. The people in Armero assumed that because the volcano had not erupted in 100 years, it had no reason to erupt so abruptly. Scientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several long period earthquakes had occurred. Long-period earthquakes are those which start out strong and then die down very slowly. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that these earthquakes occurred in the final hours before an eruption. According to Chouet, \"the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode',\" but scientists at the time doubted his theory.\n1985 eruption.\nOn November 13, 1985, at 9:08 pm, Nevado del Ruiz erupted; ejecting dacitic tephra more than 30 kilometers into the atmosphere. The amount of magma erupted from the volcano was 3% of that from Mount St. Helens in 1980. The eruption reached Volcanic Explosivity Index 3. The material ejected was described by scientists as \"unusually rich in sulfur dioxide\".\nPyroclastic flows melted ice and snow at the summit, forming 4 thick lahars that rushed down several river valleys. As most lahars do, the mudflows began as flows of water, sand, and gravel, and mixed with clay along the way. The lahars were up to thick and six feet deep (2\u00a0m) and traveled more than .\nThe lahars destroyed many houses and towns. The town of Armero was completely covered by debris, killing approximately 21,000\u00a0people (three-fourths of the population), as well as affecting 13 other villages. The eruption caused an estimated 23,000 deaths, 5,000 injuries, and destroyed more than 5,000 homes. This was the second deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, ousted only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelee, and the fourth deadliest eruption in recorded history. In addition, it was the deadliest lahar in recorded history, and Colombia's worst natural disaster.\nThe disaster gained some major international notoriety due in part to a photograph taken by photographer Frank Fournier, of a young girl named Omayra S\u00e1nchez who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. In response to the eruption, the USGS Volcano Crisis Assistance Team was formed in 1986, and the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program.\nThe volcano erupted again in 1988 and 1991.\nAftermath.\nThe eruption cost Colombia 7.7\u00a0billion dollars, about 20% of the country\u2019s GNP for the year.\nA lack of preparation contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built directly on old mudflows and authorities ignored a hazard-zone map which showed the potential damage to the town if lahars were to avalanche down the mountain. Habitants were also told to stay inside and avoid the falling ash, not thinking the mudflows would bury them. Dr. Stanley Williams of Louisiana University said that following the eruption, \"With the possible exception of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately.\"\nIn April 2008, the Nevado del Huila volcano erupted, and thousands were evacuated. Volcanologists were worried that this could be another \"Nevado del Ruiz\". Hundreds of these eruptions have had huge evacuation numbers for similar reasons.\nSurvivors who ran to other towns in the area were gradually housed in new government schemes. Armero was not rebuilt because the old lahar traces were discovered, and the Colombian government declared the site \"holy ground\" so that no one would ever suffer again like Armero.\nNow a new system can detect lahars, giving people more warning to evacuate before they happen. The system involves the use of Acoustic Flow Monitors (AFM) which analyze ground shaking that could result in a lahar. These AFMs are placed in the volcano and warn officials if there is a high amount of shaking. These devices were tested on Mount Rainier in the United States.\nGeology.\nThe glaciers of Nevado del Ruiz were formed slowly over hundreds of years. Because of global warming, the glaciers are starting to melt. Since Ruiz became well-known after its eruption in 1985, scientists and government officials in Colombia are worried the glaciers might melt completely.\nThe stratovolcano is in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of the earth's crust where the land is unstable. It encircles the Pacific Ocean, and houses some of the world's most active volcanoes. The volcano is the northernmost of several Colombian stratovolcanoes in the Andean Volcanic Belt of western South America. The Andean volcanic belt was produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate beneath the South American continental plate. Normally, these type of stratovolcanoes generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, thus producing devastating lahars.\nThe volcano is part of the Ruiz-Tolima volcanic massif (or Cordillera Central), a group of five different icy stratovolcanoes."}

The Chinese character translates as \"way,\" \"path,\" or \"route,\". In Taoism, the Tao was the origin of the whole universe. Taoists believe that the \"myriad things\", or everything in the universe from animals to materials to ideas, originally came from the Tao, and when something disappears, it's energy (or \"qi\") goes back to the Tao to be absorbed and re-birthed in a different form. \nThe Tao is a cosmic force that can't be named or described, which is the natural harmony between all living things, and the way they all move together. Taoists thought that if someone \"forgot themselves\", and let go of intentions, they would be able to \"move effortlessly\" (wu wei, or \"non-action\"), and be in harmony with the Tao, like the animals, plants, and everything else. This harmony is the ultimate goal of Taoism."}

Human nature is a source of advice on how to live well, but it also puts limits and obstacles on living a good life.\nThe complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in art and literature, while the humanities inquire into human nature, and what it means to be human.\nTheories of human nature.\nMany great thinkers have had definite ideas on human nature, but some ideas have lasted better than others. An example of this is the best-selling college textbook which first appeared in 1974 as \"Seven theories of human nature\". The seven theories were those of:\nThirty years later the selection was of ten theories:\nAristotle.\nAristotle, Plato's most famous student, made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature.\nIn his works some clear statements about human nature are made:\nFor Aristotle, reason is what is most special about humanity compared to other animals, and is what we achieve at our best.\nMuch of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today, but the particular teleological idea that humans are \"meant\" or intended to be something, has become much less popular in modern times.\nBiological theories.\nHumans are mammals, and have developed by a process of evolution. It follows that what is called human nature is inherited, and had been the product of natural selection. We are not blank slates; our mental life and behaviour has ancient roots. This is the question of nature vs nurture, and the subject-matter of evolutionary psychology. Ethology and sociobiology has also looked at these issues from the perspective of human evolution and heredity."}

It tells the story of the Walker children, who sail a dinghy (boat) named \"Swallow\", and the Blackett children, who sail a dinghy named \"Amazon\". The Walkers are staying at a farm near a lake during the school holidays; the Blacketts live in a house on the opposite shore. The children meet on an island on the lake, and have a series of adventures that weave imaginative tales of pirates and exploration into everyday life in inter-War, rural England."}

The first three rounds decide which team from each conference will move on to the last round. The last round is called the Stanley Cup Finals. The winner of that set of games becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup winner. \nThe first round of the playoffs is called the Conference Quarterfinals. There are four games in each conference. The winners of the first round advance to the second round. The third round is the Conference Finals. The two teams left in each conference (Eastern Conference and Western Conference) play each other. The conference champions advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.\nFor the first three rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts games 3, 4 and 6 (games 5\u20137 are played \"if needed\").\nUnlike regular season games, which have an altered format for overtime games (3 skaters and a goalie per side), playoff games have regular squads (5 skaters and a goalie per side) and are all played as sudden death format.\nHistory.\nBefore the 1993\u201394 season, the style was completely different. The league was split into four divisions, and the best four teams in each of the divisions went to the playoffs. Also, instead of the top team playing the 8th place team in the conference, the first place team played the fourth place team in each division, and the second place team played the third place team. In the second round, the two winning teams in each division would face each other for the divisional championship. The divisional winners in each conference would play one another in the third round for the right to advance to the Stanley Cup Final. This style is still used for deciding the teams in the playoffs in the American Hockey League."}

Ministers of the Kirk, as it is called, may be called Rectors.\nThe established kirk has suffered schism (breaks), and this has given rise to the \"Wee Frees\": the Free Church of Scotland, and (a further schism) the Free Church of Scotland (continuing) (the Wee Wee Frees); and the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland (also, confusingly, called the Wee Wee Frees). \nThe Scottish Presbyterian church was formed when it broke away from Rome in 1560. Its theology (beliefs) were based on the ideas of John Knox, a disciple of John Calvin. The free kirks tend to take the Bible more literally. \nAbout 10% of the people in Scotland are members of this church, but when asked in a census, 47% of people said this was their religion.\nGod's Invitation.\nIn 1992, the Kirk's ruling body (the General Assembly) approved the following simple summary of its beliefs.\nGod's Invitation "}

He is currently signed with All Elite Wrestling and is best known for his time with the WWE where he worked for them from 2005 until his abrupt walk-out from the company on January 27, 2014. During his time there, he was credited as being \"the longest-reigning WWE Champion of the modern era\" and held the championship for 434 days. He is also recognized as the sixth-longest reigning champion of all time. He was also a one-time ECW Champion, three-time World Heavyweight Champion, two-time WWE Champion, one-time World Tag Team Champion with Kofi Kingston, one-time Intercontinental Champion, Mr. Money in the Bank in 2008 and 2009 (the only wrestler to win the match twice), and won the Slammy Award for Superstar of the Year in 2011.\nAfter he retired from professional wrestling, Punk signed a deal to fight with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), and he began to pursue a career in mixed martial arts. He planned to begin fighting for them in 2015.\nPunk is Straight edge and is an Atheist\nCareer.\nEarly career (1999\u20132000).\nHe started out wrestling in a backyard wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation along with his friends and his brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s and used the ring name CM Punk as a member of the Chick Magnets with his tag team partner CM Venom after another wrestler had skipped out on the card. He actually wanted to become a professional wrestler unlike his friends and thought of it more than just simple fun. Punk distanced himself from his brother Mike and has not spoke to him since after he found out that Mike was stealing thousands of dollars from the company.\nHe left LWF to be trained to become a professional wrestler by Ace Steel, Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn at the \"Steel Dominion\" wrestling school in Chicago. He also competed at Steel Domain Wrestling in St. Paul, Minnesota and met Scott Colton, later known by the ring name Colt Cabana. Punk and Colton would later become best friends.\nPunk began competing for the promotion Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South. He won the IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship 2 times and the IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship five time, defeating the likes of A.J. Styles, Colt Cabana and Eddie Guerrero. He feuded with wrestlers like Colt Cabana and Chris Hero. During his feud with Hero, they competed in a 55-minute TLC match, a 93-minute two out of three falls match, and many 60-minute time limit draws. During the feud with Cabana, Punk wrestled him in many different matches. The matches he had with Cabana would lead Punk to being hired by Ring of Honor. He chose not to compete for Mid-South anymore from February 2003 until May 2004 because he said that he was protesting the mistreatment of Chris Hero from Ian Rotten. Punk returned to the company and performed as both a wrestler and commentator. He stayed with the company until 2005 when he was signed by the World Wrestling Entertainment. His last match in the company was against Delirious which ended in a 60-minute time limit draw\nOn August 1, 2003, Punk joined the Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE for the final day of their 2003 Fire Festival at Korakuen Hall. At the event, Punk teamed with C.W. Anderson, Josh Daniels, and Vansack Acid in losing effort against the team of Ikuto Hidaka, Jun Kasai, Naohiro Hoshikawa, and Tatsuhito Takaiwa.\nRing of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002-2006).\nIn 2002, Punk joined Ring of Honor. He feuded with Raven and their feud was considered to be one of the best feuds of ROH in 2003. The feud was based around Punk's straight-edge lifestyle and him comparing Raven to his alcoholic father. Their feud ended when Punk defeated Raven in a steel cage match at \"The Conclusion\". During that time, Punk joined NWA Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and was a member of Raven's stable, The Gathering along with Julio Dinero.\nPunk would begin to climb the ranks in ROH. He was able to come in second at the \"Second Anniversary Show\" during the tournament to crown the first ROH Pure Champion, losing to A.J. Styles in the finals. He also was able to win the ROH Tag Team Championship twice with Colt Cabana as a member of the Second City Saints. Both of their championship wins were against the Briscoe Brothers who they defeated. Around October 2003, Punk was hired to become the first head trainer at the Ring of Honor wrestling school.\nOn February 25, 2004, before a TNA show, Punk was involved in a physical fight with Teddy Hart outside of a restaurant which was broken up by Sabu. The scuffle was reportedly because of an ROH show where Hart performed three unplanned spots which put many other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around the time of the fight, Punk and Dinero had stopped showing up on TNA shows,which lead to speculation that he was fired because of the incident. Punk would say that the scuffle had nothing to do with his TNA career. He said that the reason he and Dinero had stopped showing up on TNA pay-per-views was because TNA officials believed that they did not connect with the fans as heels. Punk decided to quit TNA in March 2004 during the Rob Feinstein controversy, after he had an argument with the TNA offices over his ability to work for ROH after a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were no longer allowed to wrestle in ROH.\nWhen Punk returned to ROH, he wrestled ROH World Champion Samoa Joe for the championship in a three match series. The first match between the two was held on June 12, 2004 at \"World Title Classic\" in Dayton, Ohio. The match would end in a 60-minute time limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe were able to pin or cause the other to submit within the time limit given. The second match was supposed to be held on December 4, 2004 but because of Steve Corino being pulled from a match with Joe by Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE, it was rescheduled to be held on October 11, 2004 for October 16 in Punk's hometown of Chicago. At the event titled \"Joe vs. Punk II\" on October 16, Punk and Joe fought to another 60-minute time limit draw. \"Joe vs. Punk II\" became Ring of Honor's best-selling DVD at the time and the match between Punk and Joe was also given a five-star rating by Dave Meltzer's Wrestling Observer Newsletter. The series ended after Joe defeated Punk in their third and final match on December 4, 2004 at \"All-Star Extravaganza 2\" where there was no time limit.\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment/WWE (2005-2014).\nOhio Valley Wrestling (2005\u20132006).\nPunk started in the WWE's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling and debuted on September 8, 2005 in a six-man tag team dark match where he teamed with Nigel McGuinness and Paul Burchill in a losing effort to the team of Deuce Shade, Elijah Burke and Seth Skyfire. On November 9, 2005, Punk defeated Ken Doane to become the OVW Television Champion. Brent Albright was supposed to face Doane but lost his chance when Punk hit him with a steel chair. This led to Punk feuding with Albright. On January 4, 2006, Punk was involved in a Three-Way Dance match with both Doane and Albright. He lost the championship when Punk submitted to Albright's finishing move, the Crowbar. The feud ended on February 1, 2006 when a double turn occurred. Albright turned heel by allowing the Spirit Squad to beat Punk which turned Punk face. During John Cena's WrestleMania 22 entrance, Punk made a small appearance as a gangster and rode on the side of a 1930s era car to the ring.\nMatt Cappotelli, the OVW Heavyweight Champion at the time, vacated the championship in February 2006 after he found out that he had a brain tumor. After Cappotelli vacated the title, OVW held a tournament to crown a new champion. Punk was able to reach the finals and faced Brent Albright. Albright defeated Punk in the finals to become the new champion. Punk and Albright feuded again and Punk was able to defeat Albright in a strap match on May 3, 2006 to become the champion. He also became one-half of the Southern Tag Team Champions when he teamed with Seth Skyfire and defeated Shad Gaspard and the Neighborhoodie at a house show on July 28, 2006. They lost the championships to Deuce Shade and \"Domino\" Cliff Compton on July 28, 2006 and Punk feuded with Skyfire. Skyfire was supposed to face Punk in a match for the OVW Heavyweight Championship but he was attacked before the match by Charles \"The Hammer\" Evans. Chet Jablonski replaced Skyfire in the match and defeated Punk to win the championship. After Punk lost the championship, he was called up to WWE's main roster full-time.\nMain roster.\nECW (2006\u20132008).\nPunk debuted in the WWE on the ECW brand in a match against Justin Credible on August 01, 2006. He made his televised debut on the July 4 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\". During his debut, he cut a short pre-taped promo where he talked about his straight edge lifestyle. His first televised match was on August 1, 2006 at the Hammerstein Ballroom where he defeated Justin Credible. During his time there, he started a winning streak. He started a feud with Mike Knox over Knox's girlfriend, Kelly Kelly. Punk was able to qualify for the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember after he defeated Knox in their first match. He competed in the Survivor Series match where he teamed with D-Generation X and the Hardy Boyz to defeat Rated-RKO, Knox, John Morrison and Gregory Helms. During the Chamber match, Punk was the first person eliminated by Rob Van Dam.\nHe then began a feud with Hardcore Holly. On January 9, 2007, Holly was able to snap Punk's six-month unbeaten streak after he defeated him. When his feud with Holly was over, Punk started a feud with Matt Striker. Striker defeated Punk which gave Punk a second loss on his record. Punk defeated Johnny Nitro and earned a chance to compete in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. Punk didn't win the match though as it was won by Mr. Kennedy.\nPunk turned heel by joining the New Breed alliance on the April 10, 2007 \"ECW on Sci Fi\". He turned face again two weeks later when he kicked the New Breed's leader Elijah Burke in the head and cost them a four on four elimination match. Punk delivered his finishing move, the Go To Sleep, to Burke and sarcastically apologized before he left the ring. Punk would defeat Burke in a singles match at Judgment Day and teamed with The ECW Originals (Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman) to defeat The New Breed (Elijah Burke, Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Von) in a six-man tag team tables match at One Night Stand.\nWhen then-ECW Champion Bobby Lashley was drafted to \"Raw\", he was stripped of the championship and ECW held a tournament to decide the new champion. Punk defeated Marcus Cor Von on the June 19 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\". Punk was supposed to face Chris Benoit at next but Benoit legitimately no-showed the event after he killed his family and himself. He was replaced by Johnny Nitro and Nitro defeated Punk for the vacant championship.\nPunk was able to challenge for the title again at The Great American Bash against Nitro (who changed his ring name to John Morrison at this point) but was again defeated by Morrison. Punk challenged Elijah Burke and Tommy Dreamer in a triple threat match. The match was to determine who the next competitor in Morrison's 15 Minutes of Fame Challenge, in which Punk won. Punk was able to defeat Morrison a week later for an ECW Championship title match at SummerSlam. Morrison defeated Punk at SummerSlam when Morrison used the ropes for a leverage pin.\nDuring the September 1, 2007 (aired September 4) ECW taping, Punk was able to defeat Morrison in a \"last chance\" title match to win the ECW Championship. Punk successfully defended his championship against Elijah Burke at Unforgiven, Big Daddy V via disqualification at No Mercy, The Miz at Cyber Sunday, John Morrison on the November 6, 2007 episode of \"ECW\", and in a triple threat match against The Miz and John Morrison at Survivor Series. On the January 22, 2008 episode of ECW, Punk was defeated by Chavo Guerrero for the ECW Championship in a No Disqualification match after Edge ran in and speared Punk. At WrestleMania XXIV, he competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match and defeated Chris Jericho, Montel Vontavious Porter, Shelton Benjamin, John Morrison, Mr. Kennedy and Carlito.\nRaw &amp; World Heavyweight Champion (2008\u20132009).\nOn the June 23, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was drafted to the Raw brand during the 2008 WWE Draft. During his first night on \"Raw\", Batista beat down the World Heavyweight Champion Edge and left him lying in the ring. Punk then ran down the ramp to the ring with referee Mike Chioda. He then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract, hit Edge with the Go to Sleep and pinned him to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. Punk defended the title for the first time later in the night against JBL. Punk was able to hold the championship until Unforgiven on September 7, 2008. Before Punk was able to compete in the Championship Scramble match, he was attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase with Manu). Orton ended the attack by punting Punk in the head. This led to Punk being unable to compete in the match and having to forfeit the title. In the match, Punk was replaced by Chris Jericho, who was able to win the match and the title. Punk had a rematch against Jericho eight days later on the September 15 episode of \"Raw\" but he was unable to regain the title in a steel cage match.\nOn the October 27, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Punk and Kofi Kingston were able to defeat Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase to win the World Tag Team Championship. Punk and Kofi were also members of Team Batista at Survivor Series where they lost to Team Orton. After Survivor Series, Punk entered the number one contender Intercontinental Championship Tournament. Punk was able to defeat Snitsky and John Morrison in the first two rounds. On December 13, 2008, John Morrison and The Miz defeated Punk and Kingston for the World Tag Team Championship at a live event. Punk defeated Rey Mysterio the next day at Armageddon to win the tournament.\nOn the January 5 episode of \"Raw\", he received an Intercontinental Championship title match against William Regal.

He was awarded another rematch on the January 19 episode of \"Raw\" but this time it was a No Disqualification match. Punk was able to win the match and the championship. When he won the championship, Punk became the nineteenth Triple Crown Champion. He also became the person to accomplish the Triple Crown in the fastest amount of time, which broke Kevin Nash's old record. On the March 9 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was defeated for the championship by John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield. Punk was able to win the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXV and became the first person to win the match twice. At the 2009 WWE Draft on April 13, 2009, he was drafted from \"Raw\" to \"SmackDown\". He began a feud with Umaga because of Umaga's multiple surprise attacks when Punk was attempting to cash in his Money in the Bank Contract. The feud resulted in a Samoan strap match at Extreme Rules. The match was won by Punk.\nWhen the pay-per-view was about to end, Punk ran down to the ring, cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Jeff Hardy to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the June 15 episode of \"Raw\", Punk defended his championship in a Triple Threat match against Edge and Hardy. At The Bash, Punk lost to Hardy by disqualification when Punk kicked the referee after he was affected with a storyline eye injury and claimed that he could not see the referee, but because the titles do not change hands from disqualification, Punk retained the championship. When Hardy believed that Punk was faking his eye injury, he called him out on it. This led Punk to turn heel and said that he was the moral superior to fans of Hardy because of his drug-free lifestyle. Punk lost the championship to Hardy at Night of Champions. Punk and Hardy had a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at SummerSlam where Punk won the championship back. After the match, Punk was attacked by The Undertaker. Punk's feud with Hardy ended on the August 28 episode of \"Friday Night SmackDown\" when Punk defeated Hardy in a steel cage match where the loser of the match would have to leave the company.

The SmackDown general manager Theodore Long restarted the match after announcing that the ban that the former general manager Vickie Guerrero set on his move was still in effect. Punk won the match with the Anaconda Vise when the referee Scott Armstrong called for the bell even though the Undertaker did not submit (similar to the Montreal Screwjob which happened in the same arena in 1997). Punk was defeated by The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Hell in a Cell. Punk had a rematch against The Undertaker on \"Smackdown\" and had another rematch at Bragging Rights in a Fatal Four Way match which also involved Batista and Rey Mysterio but he lost both matches.\nThe Straight Edge Society &amp; New Nexus (2009\u20132011).\nHe changed his character in a more menacing direction on the November 27 episode of \"SmackDown\", when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had the former gimmick of the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had got rid of his mental problems. He continued to support his straight-edge philosophy, he began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd. He also grew out the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through the month of January, he began to convert planted members of the audience to the straight-edge lifestyle by making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and then shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After he converted multiple people who were not seen again, one of the converts Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows and they later formed the Straight Edge Society. While leading the stable, he was also the mentor of \"WWE NXT\" rookie Darren Young. At one point, Young was going to join the Straight Edge Society but he chose not to join before he was about to have his head shaved.\nPunk would occasionally give sermons and even gave sermon while competing in both the Royal Rumble and Elimination Chamber matches. During the Chamber match, Punk was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, who he was feuding with going into the PPV. This raised tensions between the two as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match which then lead to Punk interrupting Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday and singing his own version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" to her. Mysterio challenged Punk to a Street Fight at WrestleMania XXVI but he lost to Gallows. A stipulation was added by Punk that if Mysterio lost, he would have to join the Society. Mysterio defeated Punk at WrestleMania and a rematch took place at Extreme Rules where if Punk lost, he would have to have his head shaved like his disciples. Punk was able to win the match after outside interference from a fourth member of the Society who kept his face covered. A third and final match was held at Over The Limit with both of the previous stipulations put on. At the event, Punk was defeated by Mysterio and had his head shaved bald.\nPunk felt embarrassed by having his head shaved and he considered himself to be always pure unlike his followers, Punk appeared under a mask to cover his bald head on the May 29 episode of \"SmackDown\". At Fatal 4-Way, Punk challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio, The Big Show and the champion Jack Swagger but lost when Kane attacked Punk after Kane accused Punk of being the person who attacked The Undertaker. Punk was unmasked by Big Show on the July 16 episode of \"SmackDown\" while Punk was healing from an arm injury. On the July 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", Big Show unmasked the fourth member of the Straight Edge Society and it was revealed to be Joey Mercury. This incident led to a handicap match at SummerSlam. In the match, Big Show defeated the Straight Edge Society when Punk abandoned them. Punk was defeated in a singles match against Big Show at Night of Champions. A little while after, Serena was released from her WWE contract after she reportedly did not \"live out\" her straight edge persona in public. Mercury had also suffered an injury which caused the group to shorten. Gallows showed signs of dissent and Punk defeated Gallows in a match on the September 24 episode of \"SmackDown\". The ended the group.\nPunk was traded back to \"Raw\" when he was swapped with Edge. Punk competed in an interbrand tag team match at Bragging Rights after he injured Evan Bourne to take his place, but the team lost. It was later reported that Punk had been suffering from a hip injury and he would need to stop competing for a while. To stay on television, Punk appeared and began commentating on \"Raw\" starting on November 22. During his commentary time, Punk showed favor toward heels and criticized John Cena because of his actions with The Nexus. Punk left commentary after he attacked John Cena with a chair on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". Punk revealed that he had joined The Nexus and this was the reason that he had attacked Cena. Punk would command the group to attack Randy Orton and blamed him for Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008 ending. The incident led to a match at WrestleMania XXVII where Orton defeated Punk. They also had a Last Man Standing match with The New Nexus barred from ringside at Extreme Rules which Punk also lost.\nWWE Championship reign (2011-2013).\nWithin a week, Punk went on to defeat John Cena on \"Raw\", Rey Mysterio at Capitol Punishment and Alberto Del Rio in a number one contendership match. Punk would then reveal that his contract with the WWE would expire at Money in the Bank and promised that he would leave the company with the WWE Championship; some of his speeches and mannerisms were very similar to his final months with Ring of Honor. After Punk made a scathing on-air speech about the way that the WWE is run and about its owner Vince McMahon, he was suspended (storyline) from televised WWE events but he was brought back the following week after John Cena insisted. When Punk returned, he didn't appear with the other members of Nexus and the stable was quietly dissolved. This helped Punk turn back into a fan-favorite. Punk would go on to defeat John Cena at Money in the Bank to become the WWE Champion during his final night under a WWE contract.\nOn July 21, he made a surprise appearance at a joint WWE-Mattel panel at the San Diego Comic Con. During his appearance, Punk mocked the Chief Operating Officer Triple H and also offered a match to the WWE Championship tournament finalist Rey Mysterio as long as the match took place in Punk's hometown of Chicago. The WWE Championship tournament was won by Mysterio on the July 25 episode of \"Raw\" but he lost to Cena later in the night. When Cena won, Punk returned to upstage Cena's WWE Championship victory celebration which lead to a title dispute. Triple H later supported the fact that both Punk and Cena's claims as the WWE Championship as legitimate and he scheduled a match between the two at SummerSlam to decide who would become the undisputed WWE Champion. At SummerSlam, Punk was able to win the match but he lost the championship shortly after when Kevin Nash attacked Punk and Alberto Del Rio cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. On \"Raw\" the next night, Punk accused Nash of working with Triple H to try and keep Punk away from the WWE Championship. After many confrontations between the two, Punk and Nash demanded that they face each other at Night of Champions and Triple H agreed.

At Hell in a Cell, Punk competed in a Triple threat Hell in a Cell match against Alberto Del Rio and John Cena but he was defeated. After the match, Punk was again attacked by The Miz and R-Truth. At Vengeance, Punk teamed up with Triple H in a match against The Miz and R-Truth but they lost after Nash attacked Triple H. The loss helped switch Punk's anti-establishment voice from Triple H over to John Laurinaitis, who became the interim Raw general manager.

On the December 26 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was defeated in a gauntlet match by Dolph Ziggler which made Ziggler become the number one contender for the WWE Championship. If Punk was able to win the gauntlet match, he would have earned the right to face Laurinaitis in a match. On the January 2 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was defeated by Ziggler via countout after Laurinaitis interfered in the match. Throughout January, Laurinaitis would continue to mess up Punk's matches and cause him to lose to Ziggler. This eventually led to Punk attacking Laurinaitis.

On the February 6 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho explained why he attacked Punk, saying that the WWE roster were imitations of himself and he singled out Punk for claiming that he was the best in the world, a moniker that Jericho had used during the last time that he was in WWE. Punk competed in an Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. The match also featured Jericho who Punk kicked out of the chamber and suffered a short lasting injury. Punk was able to win the match and retain his championship. On the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho won a 10-Man No. 1 Contender's Battle Royal and earned a match against Punk for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXVIII. To try and gain a psychological edge, Jericho revealed that Punk's father was an alcoholic and also alleged that Punk's sister was a drug addict. Jericho said that Punk's straight edge philosophy was so that he would not end up falling into the same vices and promised that he would make Punk turn to alcohol by defeating him and winning the championship from him. A stipulation was added to the match by John Laurinaitis that if Punk was disqualified, he would have lost the championship. Jericho would then try to get Punk to use a weapon which Punk refused to do. Punk was able to defeat Jericho and retain his championship at WrestleMania XXVIII. On both the April 2 and 9 episodes of \"Raw SuperShow\", Punk was able to retain his championship against Mark Henry after he lost to him via count-out and disqualification. After both of the matches, Jericho would attack Punk and pour alcohol on him. On the April 16 episode of \"Raw SuperShow\", Punk was able to pin Henry in a no disqualification, no countout match to retain his title. The feud ended at Extreme Rules when Punk was able to retain his championship by defeating Jericho in a Chicago Street Fight.\nPunk would go to feud with Daniel Bryan starting at Over the Limit when Punk was able to retain his championship after he reversed Bryan's finishing submission hold, the \"Yes!\" Lock, into a pinning combination. The replay, however, would show that Punk had visibly tapped out moments after the match finished.

After the night's special guest The Rock tried to help Cena, Punk would attack him and turn heel. On the next \"Raw\", Punk would explain that he attacked The Rock because he was tired of being overshadowed by people like Cena and Rock when the main focus of the company should be on the WWE Champion. Punk would attack both Cena and Big Show during their number one contender's match later on in the night. As a result of this, both Cena and Show were put into a title match against Punk at SummerSlam. At SummerSlam, Punk successfully defended his championship against them in a triple threat match. During the following weeks, Punk would demand respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart. He would eventually be managed by Paul Heyman during Punk's feud with Cena. Punk would face Cena to a draw at Night of Champions. Even though Cena was suffering from an arm injury, they continued to feud. Punk would reject Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his Hell in a Cell opponent and lead to Punk fighting with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. After Cena's injury made him unable to wrestle at Hell in a Cell, he was replaced by Ryback. At Hell in a Cell, Punk was able to defeat Ryback and retain his championship after referee Brad Maddox hit Ryback with a low-blow.\nOn \"Raw\" the next night, an angry Mick Foley confronted Punk for not picking John Cena as his Hell in a Cell opponent. Foley and Punk then agreed to face each other in the traditional five-on-five elimination tag team at Survivor Series. Punk would chose Alberto Del Rio, Cody Rhodes, Damien Sandow, and The Miz to be on his team but Punk was later replaced as team captain by Dolph Ziggler after Mr. McMahon booked him in a Triple Threat WWE Championship match against John Cena and Ryback instead. At the pay-per-view, Punk defeated Cena and Ryback after interference from the debuting stable called The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) which allowed him to retain his WWE Championship. He would hold the championship for a full year. On December 4, Punk underwent surgery for a partially torn meniscus which removed him from his title match against Ryback at . Even though Punk was injured, he became the longest reigning WWE Champion in the past 25 years on December 5, after he reached 381 days which passed John Cena's 380-day reign. Punk returned to in-ring action on the January 7, 2013 episode of \"Raw\" where he defeated Ryback in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, following interference from The Shield to retain his championship.\nPunk defended his WWE Championship against The Rock at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2013. A stipulation was added to the match where if The Shield interfered, then Punk would be stripped of the title. Punk had originally pinned The Rock to retain his championship after The Shield attacked and put The Rock through a table while the arena lights were out. Vince McMahon came out to the entrance ramp and started to announce that Punk would be stripped of the championship, but he instead restarted the match at The Rock's request. Punk ended up losing the match, ending his record-setting reign at 434 days. Punk would receive a rematch for the championship on February 17 at the Elimination Chamber, with the stipulation that if The Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would lose the WWE Championship. Rock was able to pin and defeat Punk in the match to retain the championship. On the February 25 episode of \"Raw\", Punk faced off against Royal Rumble winner John Cena for his number one contendership to the WWE Championship, but was defeated.\nDeparture and retirement (2014).\nOn January 26, 2014, Punk was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble match. After he was able to last in the match until the final four, Kane, who was already eliminated earlier in by Punk, eliminated Punk from the outside and then chokeslammed him through the announcer's table.\nThe night after the Royal Rumble, Punk did not show up \"Raw\" or on the \"SmackDown\" tapings on Tuesday in Toledo, Ohio even though he was advertised. It was reported by the Wrestling Observer that, on Monday before Raw, Punk legitimately walked out of the company after he told both Vince McMahon and Triple H that he was \"going home\". On February 20, McMahon said that Punk was \"taking a sabbatical\" during a conference call to investors. After weeks of hearing the crowd chant for CM Punk at various WWE events, the company decided to make its first comments on the status of Punk on the March 3, 2014 episode of \"Raw\" in Punk's hometown of Chicago. When the show started, they played Punk's entrance music \"Cult of Personality\" and his old manager Paul Heyman came out instead. Heyman said that Punk was not at \"Raw\" and blamed the crowd. He also blamed the Undertaker for Punk's split from Heyman. On July 15, 2014, WWE moved Punk's profile from the active roster to their alumni page without them releasing a statement. On the same day, Punk thanked his fans without mentioning WWE on Twitter. In late July, Punk said that he was \"never ever\" going to return to wrestling.\nOn November 26, 2014, Punk appeared on his friend Colt Cabana's \"Art of Wrestling\" podcast. During the podcast, Punk decided to break his silence on his decision on leaving the WWE. Punk said the WWE had suspended him for two months after he walked out in January, and that he was fired by the company months later on his wedding day in June 2014.

He also said that after a legal settlement with WWE, there would not be a further working relationship between them. The settlement that was reached included Punk giving the company permission to sell the rest of his remaining merchandise. Punk said that the main reason he left the WWE was because of his health problems. Punk said that during his last months with the company, he was working through an untreated and possibly fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, multiple concussions which included one at the Royal Rumble when Kofi Kingston kicked him, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. He felt that the company had been pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he was fully healed. Punk also noted that he was unhappy with his failure to main event a WrestleMania (saying that his entire career was a failure as a result), him being paid less than the other top wrestlers on the card for WrestleMania 29, being \"creatively stifled\" and him having the feeling that there were no long-term plans for wrestlers other than John Cena, as well as receiving smaller paychecks and not getting answers as to how the WWE Network would effect the salaries of the wrestlers. Punk ended with saying that he has \"zero passion\" left for wrestling.\nNot even a week later, Vince McMahon appeared on Stone Cold Steve Austin's podcast \"The Steve Austin Show\". During the podcast, Stone Cold asked McMahon if he wanted to speak about CM Punk.

McMahon also said that he would like to work with Punk again. Punk would appear on Cabana's \"Art of Wrestling\" podcast again. During the podcast, Punk said that he did not accept McMahon's apology, saying that it was insincere and a \"publicity stunt\" as McMahon had not contacted him directly to apologize and that he could have apologized earlier.\nAll Elite Wrestling (2021 - Present)\nCM Punk debuted for All Elite Wrestling in August 2021, after seven years away from professional wrestling. He will make his in ring return September 5th, 2021 against Darby Allin at All Out in Chicago, Illinois.\nMixed martial arts career.\nUltimate Fighting Championship.\nOn December 6, 2014, during UFC 181, Punk along with Joe Rogan announced that he had signed a multi-fight deal with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to fight in either their middleweight or welterweight division.

Impossible objects are also known as undecidable figures. In this kind of illusion, a person looks at a two-dimensional picture. The vision center of the brain does much of its work subconsciously and automatically. It interprets the figure as a three-dimensional object.\nThe viewer usually knows such an object is impossible soon after looking at the figure. However, the impression of a 3D figure may still remain even when the viewer knows it is impossible in reality.\nSome of these figures are more subtle. In these cases it is not obvious that they are impossible right away. The viewer carefully needs to look at the geometry of the object to find out that it is indeed impossible.\n\"Impossible objects\" are of interest to psychologists, mathematicians and artists.\nHistory.\nSwedish artist Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd was the first person to draw many impossible objects. He has been called \"the father of impossible figures\". In 1934, he drew the Penrose triangle, some years before the Penroses. The way Reutersv\u00e4rd drew it, the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes.\nIn 1956, British psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, mathematician Roger Penrose, submitted a short article to the British Journal of Psychology titled \"Impossible objects: a special type of visual illusion\". This was illustrated with the Penrose Triangle and Penrose stairs. The article referenced Escher, whose work had sparked their interest in the subject, but not Reutersv\u00e4rd, whom they were unaware of. The article was only published in 1958.\nFrom the 1930s onwards Dutch artist M.C. Escher produced many drawings with paradoxes of perspective. In 1957 he produced his first drawing containing a true impossible object: \"Cube with Magic Ribbons\". He produced many other drawings of impossible objects, sometimes with the entire drawing being an undecidable figure. His work did much to draw the attention of the public to impossible objects. Some artists of the time are also experimenting with impossible figures, for example, Jos de Mey, Shigeo Fukuda, Sandro del Prete, Istv\u00e1n Orosz (Utisz), Guido Moretti, Tam\u00e1s F. Farkas and Mathieu Hamaekers."}

The current leader is Josef Bucher.\nPolicies.\nThe BZ\u00d6 describes itself as \"ideologiefrei, aber zukunftsorientiert und wertebewusst\" (free from ideology, but forward-looking and conscious of traditional values). Some of its policies, however, are quite different from those of the Freedom Party.\nThey include:\nDifferences and similarities to other parties.\nAlthough the party was often designated as a far-right like the Freedom Party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria differs somewhat. Justic Minister Karin Gastinger a former party member of the Alliance for the Future of Austria, wanted gay and lesbian couples to be able to sign a registry and get rights to partners' estates and medical care as she told the Austrian Press Agency in 2005.\nFP\u00d6 and BZ\u00d6 are both Eurosceptic parties and in the 2006 general election, the Freedom Party as well as the Alliance for the Future of Austria both claimed they would decrease immigration and opposed Turkish membership in the European Union.\nIn the Austrian legislative election 2008 campaign, the \u00d6VP saw the lowering of brokerage commissions and the charges for arrears letters of debt collection agencies and winter fuel payments for lower-income households as appropriate economic recovery measures and the Greens sought to facilitate the changeover to renewable energy in order to reduce energy prices.\nThe SP\u00d6 proposes a stricter controlling of prices in addition to the reduction of brokerage commissions. Both the Alliance for the Future of Austria and the Freedom Party see the main problem in the rising fuel prices; the FP\u00d6 demands a ceiling price for fuel, while the BZ\u00d6 in addition wants to reduce taxes on fuels. \nHowever the Alliace for the Future of Austria even announced the people's initiative \"Preisstop jetzt!\" calling for a stop to rising prices to be held; however, due to the necessary timeframe, the period during which people will be able to sign for the initiative will only start after the election, thus limiting its potential impact.\nSP\u00d6, \u00d6VP and the Greens ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in parliament without a referendum, and only FP\u00d6 and the Alliance for the Future of Austria did not sign. But afterwards the SP\u00d6 stated that for future treaties of the European Union referendums should be held to let the people decide like in Ireland (where they had a referendum). Due to SP\u00d6's position change on the EU not only the two opposition parties are using the possibility of EU-referendums before a ratification as subject now. The \u00d6VP and the Greens are against any referendums on the Lisbon Treaty, SP\u00d6 demands there should be referendums on future treaties of the European Union, the FP\u00d6 is for a referendum for the Lisbon Treaty, and even want a referendum for EU-Withdrawal. However the BZ\u00d6 differs a bit in comparison to the Freedom Party, as they are for a referendum about the Lisbon Treaty but not, for an EU-Withdrawal.\nDue to help of the former FP\u00d6 and till then BZ\u00d6 party-leader and Carinthian LH (LH stands for \"Landeshauptmann\", simply like Gov. for Governor) Dr. J\u00f6rg Haider the party achieved 10.7% in the 2008 elections and gained 21 representatives, so that the BZ\u00d6 is currently the 4th strongest Party in the Austrian Parliament just after SP\u00d6,\u00d6VP and FP\u00d6\nand before \"Die Gr\u00fcnen\" (the Greens).\nIt currently holds 16 seats.\nOn 2 May 2010 the party became a new programm, and the rectlange orange colored logo was first used on the annual hold new year's convention, which took place in Velden in Carinthia of the year 2011.\nTrivia.\nIn December 2009 the Carinthian BZ\u00d6 branch which was Haiders stronghold lost about 5000 members and the governor of Carinthia (although the party won the state election in 2009)to the split of party FPK (The Freedomites in Carinthia).\nIt now has 800 party members and 4 MPs (Members of parliament) in Carinthia.\nAlso a new website for the BZ\u00d6 K\u00e4rnten was set up and is available prior too March 2012.\nHowever opinion polls (polling between 2 and 23 per cent) have shown good chances for a return of the Carinthian branch of the Alliance for the Future of Austria into Carinthian State Diet.\nIn 2011 the party began an autumn posting campaign and quoted the bible \"Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun.\",\neng.: \"They know not what they do!\" (Lukas 23,34),\nfor criticising SP\u00d6, \u00d6VP and the EU \"bosses\".\nThis caused a little scandal whether politics and religion should be separated or not.\nIn total the party has 8000 members therefore having more than the Greens and less than the Freedom Party."}

It is the home of the National Tramway Museum. It is set up as an Edwardian village and has a street with shops which include a sweet shop, caf\u00e9 and gift shop. Other buildings in the open-air museum are the Red Lion Pub from Stoke-on-Trent, Derby Assembly Rooms, Burnley Tramways Offices and the tram sheds and displays. There are tram lines which go out for about from the village. There is also a collection of old street furniture from around the United Kingdom.\nThe trams that are in the museum used to run on tramlines along the streets of different towns and cities. Most of the trams at Crich were used in the United Kingdom before the 1960s. Some are from other countries. Many were saved and restored after the tram services in the cities stopped.\nHistory of the museum.\nBefore World War II, tramways were an important type of public transport in many cities in the United Kingdom. (Trams pulled by horses began to be built in the late 19th century.) After World War II, they began to close. Many people thought that the trams and tramways got in the way of motor cars and buses and that fuel for buses was costing less than the cost of making electricity. Most tram networks in the United Kingdom had closed by 1962. Only one remained in use, the Blackpool tramway which still runs today.\nIn 1948, a group of tramway enthusiasts decided to buy an open top tram that they had been on during the last tram ride of Southampton Tramways. For just \u00a310, they bought Southampton No. 45, Although there were trams and locomotives in British museums, there were no working museums or heritage railways in Britain at this time, so at first the idea of amateurs running a tramway or railway seemed impossible. In 1955 the Tramway Museum Society was started and in 1959, the Society chose a place for the museum after a very long search. The site was found by the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society when they were taking apart the old track from George Stephenson's railway for a project in Wales.\nIn the 1840s, when Stephenson was building the North Midland Railway from Derby to Rotherham and Leeds, he found coal buried under the ground on the way to Clay Cross. He decided to mine it and make some money. Crich already had a limestone quarry when he started. Stephenson saw that he could use this limestone and coal to make burnt lime for agricultural use and then use his railway to move it. To link the quarry at Crich to the limekilns at Ambergate, a new metre gauge railway was built, which is said to be the first in the world. The museum is built on part of the old Cliff Quarry, which Stephenson's company bought.\nAfter the Tramway Museum Society's members visited the quarry, they bought part of the site and buildings. Since buying them, the society has gotten many trams, as well as getting track and power for the trams. Many of the tramcars were also repaired. In 1967, the society decided that they would start a village around the tramway, as trams did not run in limestone quarries. This was the start of Crich Tramway Village. The museum got lots of street furniture, and even some entire buildings. Many of these buildings have been changed to hold the museum's collections of books, pictures, and archives.\nIn 1962 the Tramway Museum Society became a company and a year later it was listed as an educational charity. Since then, the society has grown with the help of people all over the world. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport said that the museum has a very good collection. It was one of the first 26 museums that was told this in 1995.\nSince the start of the 2000s, the work of the museum's volunteers and the income earned by visitors has been added to by grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund The museum is still an independent charity; this means that the government does not pay for it.\nIn the early 1990s, the government of the United Kingdom decided that trams were a way of stopping the traffic problems in the UK. New light rail systems, or \"second generation tramways\", opened in cities like Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham. Twenty years later more systems are being built, like the one in Edinburgh.\nTramcar fleet.\nThe museum has over 60 tramcars from places such as Berlin, Blackpool, Chesterfield, Den Haag, Derby, Douglas, Dundee, Edinburgh, Gateshead, Glasgow, Grimsby, Halle, Howth, Johannesburg, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, New York, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Oporto, Paisley, Prague, Sheffield, Southampton and Sydney.\nMost of these tramcars are double-deckers and some have open-tops.\nThe museum has about fifteen fully working tramcars. Every day that the museum is open, one to four of those trams are in service on the mile long line. There is also a 1969 Berlin tram that has been changed into an \"Access Tram\".\nMany of the trams can be seen at the museum. Some, such as Blackpool Dreadnought 59 and Blackpool OMO 5, are stored in the Museum's depot at Clay Cross.\nMethods of tramcar operation.\nThe museum has trams using four different types of operation \u2013 horse, steam, diesel and electricity. Electricity is used for most of the service trams and works cars, but for one weekend each year a horse tram runs. The museum has five horse trams, Leamington &amp; Warwick 1, Chesterfield 8, Oporto 9, Sheffield 15 and Cardiff 21, but only Sheffield 15 is used. The rest are on display. The museum also has a steam tram engine on display.\nMost systems have their overhead wire system built to operate with just one form of current collector (the part that gives the tram electricity). The museum has been built to use any of them, including trolley poles, bow collectors and pantographs. Conduit current collection is another form of current collection. Blackpool 4 uses this, and it was also used in London."}

Because of a defect in the heart ventricle walls, deoxygenated blood sometimes mixes with the blood from the lungs. The resulting blood going through the aorta has less oxygen than usual. The baby then looks blue. An operation is usually done to fix this. \nThere are several heart defects which produce this syndrome. There are also some causes which are not related to heart conditions.\nOn November 29, 1944, the first successful operation for the heart condition was done at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

It is a result of a need being, then the need being met. A free market contrasts with a regulated market, in which government intervenes in supply and demand through non-market methods such as laws creating barriers to market entry or price fixing. In a free-market economy, prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy, and it typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of productive enterprises.\nAlthough free markets are commonly associated with capitalism within a market economy in contemporary usage and popular culture, free markets have also been advocated by free-market anarchists, market socialists, and some proponents of cooperatives and advocates of profit sharing.[1] "}

There are about 90 species, mostly in the Old World and Australasia, Most species are tropical in distribution.\nTheir feathers are often bright colours, such as blue or orange. They have large heads, long, sharp bills, short legs, and stubby tails.\nMost species have bright plumage with little differences between the sexes. Most are found only in forests. They eat a wide range of prey, including fish. They usually catch prey by swooping down from a perch. Many live near rivers and eat fish, but most species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other birds of their order they nest in holes, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of all kingfishers nest in disused termite nests.\nClassification.\nBased on sequence analysis, the 90 or so species of kingfishers are now divided into three families:\nHabitat.\nKingfishers are found all over the world. They often make their nests near rivers where the water flows slowly. They make their nests in tall river banks. They dig a hole in the side of the river bank. Most kingfishers lay 3\u20136 eggs each time.\nMany kingfishers eat fish. They sit on branches hanging over the river's edge and wait for a fish to appear. They then dive into the water to catch the fish. Some kingfishers eat lizards or other reptiles. Kookaburras do this.\nHistory.\nMost species are in the Australasian region, but the family did not originate there. They evolved in the Northern Hemisphere and invaded the Australasian region a number of times. Fossil kingfishers have been described from Lower Eocene rocks in Wyoming 50 million years ago (mya) and in Germany, around 30-40 million years ago. More recent fossil kingfishers have been described in the Miocene/Pliocene rocks of Australia (5-25 mya).\nConservation.\nKingfishers are easily harmed if there is a lot of snow and cold weather in winter. They can also die if humans cause a lot of water pollution or if the places where Kingfishers live are destroyed. Some kingfishers are endangered species\nKingfisher is the most species birds"}

There is no real formatting control (for bold or \"Italics\", etc.) \nSometimes someone talks about a file or document in ASCII, meaning it is in plain text.\nASCII usually uses 7 binary digits (bits) to represent characters: 1000001 (or 41 in hexadecimal or 65 in standard base-10 numbers) represents the upper-case letter A; 1000010 represents B; 1000011 represents C; and so on in sequence. Eight bits allowed a \"parity bit\" to be included in each byte sent over a serial port or modems, this bit is used for avoiding errors. This was more important years ago when connections were often noisy.\nExtended ASCII.\nASCII does not have diacritics (marks that are added to a letter, like the dots (umlauts) above vowels in German, or the tilde (~) above the 'n' for the '\u00f1' used in Spanish). It was only meant for English and doesn't work well for most other languages. Some English words borrowed from other languages use these marks as well, like \"resum\u00e9\" (see Appendix:English words with diacritics).\nThis led to some systems using 8 bits (a full byte) instead of 7 bits. The proper name for systems that use 8 bits is called \"extended ASCII\". Eight bits allows for 256 characters. The first 128 characters must be the same as for ASCII and the rest are usually used for alphabetic letters with accents, for example like \u00c9, \u00c8, \u00ce and \u00dc. This solves the problem for languages that are based on the Latin alphabet, although not all extended ASCII systems are the same. Other alphabets, like the Greek alphabet, Cyrillic alphabet need a different set of characters. And some systems like those using Chinese characters still do not work, as they use thousands of characters. So unicode was created to have one common system for all languages.\nStandard ASCII is still commonly used, particularly in computer software and HTML files. Until 2010 it was the standard for URLs. Often a web site that has fields for entering text will only take ASCII text. Any special markups for bold or centered text, etc. will show up incorrectly."}

It is the only state flag of the United States to have the Union Flag of the United Kingdom on it.\nDesign.\nThe field of the flag is composed of eight horizontal stripes symbolizing the eight major islands. A ninth stripe was once shown, meaning the island of Nihoa. The color of the stripes, from the top down, has this pattern: white, red, blue, white, red, blue, white, red. The colors were standardized in 1843, although other combinations have been seen and are occasionally still used.\nOrigins.\nThere are a lot of reasons for the earliest history of the flag of Hawaii. One said how King Kamehameha I flew a British flag, given to him by British explorer Captain George Vancouver as a token of friendship with King George III. Other visits reported seeing the flag flying from places of honor. An adviser to Kamehameha noted that the Union Flag could draw Hawaii into international problems as his kingdom could be seen as an ally of the United Kingdom, and he quickly lowered the Union Flag over his home. While argued as historically correct, one report of events that followed stated that in order to please American interests during the War of 1812, a flag of the United States was raised over Kamehameha's home only to be removed when British officers in the court of Kamehameha powerfully objected to it. This account then explains why the resulting flag of Hawaii was a deliberate combination of the two nations' flags.\nIn 1816, Kamehameha appointed his own flag to avoid problems. As a result, the current flag of Hawaii was born. There is debate as to the name of the officer: some traditions credit Alexander Adams, others George Beckley. The original flag was designed to feature stripes alternating in the order: red-white-blue. However, some have argued that the stripes were influenced by the flag of the United States. The flag used at the first official flying of the flag of Hawaii erroneously placed the stripes in the order: white-red-blue. The number of stripes also changed. Originally, the flag was designed with seven horizontal stripes. In 1845 it changed to have eight stripes (at one point, there were nine but later the number changed back to eight). The arrangement was adopted and is used today."}

It was held in South Africa from 11 June to 10 July 2010. In the host selection, only African countries may be selected as host of this tournament. In 2004 FIFA selected South Africa to become it the first African country hosted FIFA World Cup.\nThe matches were played in 10 stadiums in 9 cities around the country. The final was played at the Soccer City, Johannesburg\nAll countries (except South Africa that qualified as host nation) took part in qualification tournament to qualify to the World Cup. In the first round all teams were divided to eight groups of four teams where team played with other three teams in group. Two best teams from each group qualify to knockout stage where teams need to win 3 matches to reach the final.\nIn the final Spain, the European champions, won the tournament. They defeated Netherlands 1-0 in extra time with Andr\u00e9s Iniesta's goal in the 116th minute. Spain got their first World Cup title and they also became the first European team won the World Cup outside Europe. They also became the first team to win the World Cup after losing their first match. Host nation of this tournament South Africa, winner (Italy) and finalist (France) of previous World Cup were all failed the group stage. It was the first time when host nation was not qualified to knockout stage. New Zealand was only team that did not lose any matches but it also did not advance to knockout stage\nStadiums.\nIn 2005, the organizers released a list of thirteen venues to be used for the World Cup. They were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006:\nMan of the match.\nNew for 2010 is the Budweiser Man of the Match award. Fans vote for the top player for each match in the World Cup tournament.\nGroup Stage.\nThe first round was also called the Group stage. There were 32 teams in the first round of the World Cup. The teams were divided into eight groups with four teams in each group. The groups were named Group A through Group H.\nEach team in a group played all the other teams in their group one time. That means there were six games in each group and 48 games in the first round. The top two teams from each group in this round advanced (were allowed to play) in the next round, named the Round of 16.\nThe FIFA uses the following method to rank teams in the first round.\nLegend:\nAll times are given in South African Standard time (UTC+2).\nGroup F.\nSchedule\nGroup G.\nSchedule\nGroup H.\nSchedule\nKnockout stage.\nThe games starting with the second round are known as the knockout stage. These games can not end in a draw (tie). If a match (game) is tied at the end of 90 minutes (the regular game time limit), extra periods are added to the game. Two periods, each 15 minutes long, will be played. If the score is still tied after the two extra periods, the game will be decided by a penalty kick shootout.\nFinal.\n&lt;br&gt;\nStatistics.\nDiscipline.\n28 players were suspended after being shown two consecutive yellow cards (13 players), a single red card (8 players), or a yellow card followed by a red card (7 players).\nAll-Star Team.\nThe Best 11 was decided by an online public vote, where people were invited to select a team (in a 4\u20134\u20132 formation) and best coach. Voting was open until 23:59 on 11 July 2010, with submissions going into a draw to win a prize.\nSix of the eleven players came from the Spanish team, as did the coach. The remainder of the team comprised two Germans, one Brazilian, one Dutchman and a Uruguayan."}

The Battle Flag was square-shaped, and Alabama's flag is sometimes shown as a square. The authors of a 1917 article in National Geographic expressed their opinion that because the Alabama flag was based on the Battle Flag, it should be square. In 1987, Don Siegelman issued an opinion in which the Battle Flag derivation is repeated, but concluded that the proper shape is rectangular, as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions.\nHowever, the saltire design of the Alabama state flag also looks like several other flags. It is identical to the saltire of St. Patrick, incorporated into the British Union Flag to represent the union of the United Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland. This has led to other origins being put forth as possibilities."}
{"id": "134950", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=134950", "title": "Flag of Mexico", "text": "The Flag of the United Mexican States or Mexico is a tricolor of green, white, and red with an eagle charged in the center of the white stripe. While the meaning of the colors has changed over time, these three colors were adopted by Mexico following independence from Spain during the country's War of Independence. The current flag was adopted in 1968, but the design has been used since 1821. The current law of national symbols, Law on the National Arms, Flag, and Anthem, that governs the use of the national flag has been in place since 1984. Red, white, and green are the colors of the national liberation army in Mexico. The central emblem is the ancient Aztec symbol for Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), the center of the Aztec Empire. It recalls the legend that inspired the Aztecs to settle on what was originally a lake-island. The form of the coat of arms was most recently revised in 1968. Aztec legend held that they should found their city on the spot where they saw an eagle on a cactus, eating a snake. There is a ribbon in the national colors at the bottom of the coat of arms.\nLegend.\nIn the early 14th century, the Mexica people were a wandering tribe of nomads looking for a permanent settlement in modern day central Mexico. They survived by hunting and gathering and were often hired to fight as mercenaries for the city-states scattered throughout the region. According to legend, their god, Huitzilopochtli, told them to establish a city of their own at a site where they would find an eagle eating a snake on the top of a cactus. The legend relates that the people saw the eagle on a small, swampy island in the middle of the shallow Texcoco lake. The Mexica invented a resourceful system of gardening, called chinampas, which allowed them to grow small gardens, eventually drying out the lake. In 1325, they completed construction of a city there. That city, which they called Tenochtitlan, became the capital of the Aztec Empire."}
{"id": "134952", "revid": "766335", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=134952", "title": "Flag of the United Kingdom", "text": "The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag or Union Jack. The Union Flag is the national flag of the United Kingdom. It has had the same design since the Act of Union 1800. The flag is made from the flags of the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\nThere are different flags for use on land and at sea. The flag's measurements at sea are 1:2 (the flag is twice as long as it is wide). On land, it is normal for the flag's proportions to be 3:5.\nThe use of the flag started (with a different design) in 1606, after James VI and I became the first king of the whole of Great Britain in 1603. Between 1606 and 1801, the Union Flag's design was different to the present flag. At that time, the Kingdom of Ireland was a separate kingdom. (Between the execution of Charles I and the Restoration of Charles II, there was no personal union between Scotland and England, so the Union Flag was not necessary.) Scotland and England became the United Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Anne, Queen of Great Britain, chose the Union Flag as the flag of the new kingdom. The United Kingdom and Ireland joined together in 1801. The use of the present British flag started then.\nThe first Union Flag from 1603 combined the flag of Scotland with the flag of England. The flag of Scotland is a Saint Andrew's Cross because Saint Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland. The flag of England is Saint George's Cross because Saint George is the patron saint of England. When the present United Kingdom started in 1801, the Saint Patrick's Cross started to be a part of the Union Flag. Saint Patrick's Cross was a flag representative of Ireland because Saint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland. Saint Patrick's Cross is a red saltire (a diagonal cross) with a white background. The flag of Scotland is blue with a white saltire. The flag of England is white with a red horizontal cross. Together they make the Union Flag.\nThe flag did not change as result of the independence of the Republic of Ireland. The flag did not change when the United Kingdom's name changed from the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\" to the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". The flag does not contain anything that represents Wales. (In 1603, Wales had long been a part of the kingdom of England.) Some people want a new design because of this. \nLegacy.\nThe Union Jack has a legacy for flags, and some of the former colonies of Britain have this design on their own flags (i.e. Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, some provinces of Canada, etc.)."}

Most notably, he led them during the Battle of the Somme, the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele), the Spring Offensive and the final Hundred Days Offensive.\nHistorians have often argued over whether Haig was a good general. In the years after the war, he was popular. After his death, some historians and politicians wrote books criticising Haig. They argued he made mistakes that led to a lot of casualties among British troops, especially at the Somme and Passchendaele; he has been nicknamed 'Butcher Haig' or 'the Butcher of the Somme'. David Lloyd George, the Prime Minister during the later years of the war, also did not agree with Haig. One of the best known books criticising Haig was Alan Clark's book \"The Donkeys\" (1961). This is known as the 'lions led by donkeys' view: the idea that Britain had great soldiers but bad generals.\nAll the same, some veterans, and academic historians have argued that Haig was a great general. For example, John Bourne notes that Haig helped the army use new weapons and technology. John Terraine argues that while the British Army lost a lot of men, this is not surprising given the size of the fighting, and other countries lost far more. Likewise, Gordon Corrigan argues that as a percentage of the population, Britain lost half as many people in the war as France and Germany."}

This was a problem because it made it easier for the enemy to see them and shoot them. The newer system uses two short poles with square flags. The signalman holds one pole in each hand. The poles are held in one of eight possible directions. Except for in the \"rest position\", the flags do not cross over each other. Flags of different colours are used based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land. At sea, the flags are coloured red and yellow. On land, they are white and blue.

It is the most common form of traumatic brain injury. Related terms include mild brain injury, mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), mild head injury (MHI), and minor head trauma. Patients with severe concussion are occasionally monitored in hospital. The main reason for this is the risk of bleeding in the brain, which can be life-threatening. \nCommon symptoms of concussion include: headache, dizziness, fatigue, problems with vision, confusion and loss of consciousness. A person with a mild concussion may have nothing more than a headache or brief confusion. In more severe cases, symptoms tend to last longer, and may include loss of consciousness. Other associated symptoms are: worsening headache, inability to wake, dilation of the eyes, vomiting, nausea, loss of coordination and weakness of extremities. \nSymptoms may last less than a week in minor cases, but recovery from more severe concussions can take up to 4 weeks. The most common causes of concussions are accidents; in some cases, wearing a helmet can help prevent major damage. \nConcussion and Aphasia.\nOne often underreported symptom of concussion is aphasia.\u00a0 Aphasia is the loss of ability to produce or understand speech; it is caused by brain damage.\u00a0 Most of the important areas for speech and language are located in the left hemisphere. As such, patients who have concussions due to injury on the left side of the head could be more at risk for these symptoms. \nThe most common kinds of aphasia associated with traumatic brain injury are amnestic aphasia and verbal paraphasia.\u00a0 Amnesic aphasia, also known as anomia, is an issue with word finding where patients struggle to find words for objects that they once knew. \u00a0There is no impairment of comprehension associated with anomia. This can be especially challenging for students trying to return to school and professionals returning to work.\u00a0 The second kind of aphasia associated with concussion is verbal paraphasia, the substitution of one word for another.\u00a0 Typically, the substituted word will have a similar meaning as the word it replaces; e.g. substituting sock with shoe.\u00a0\nAs with most concussion symptoms, aphasia symptoms correlated with concussion typically get progressively better, as evidenced by a study done by Inger Vibeke Thomsen. Of the concussion patients studied that showed aphasia symptoms, only one patient had long term aphasia.\u00a0 The others showed almost full recovery. \nThe National Aphasia Association recognizes that concussions can cause aphasia.\u00a0 In serious concussions, aphasia is a documented symptom and can be temporary or permanent.\u00a0 This is correlated to injury of brain regions that are important for language production. However, traumatic brain injuries usually effect multiple areas of the brain, so other symptoms will also be present. The damage causing aphasia will usually be on the left side of the brain."}

It is a bulb containing\u00a0Mercury\u00a0attached to a\u00a0glass\u00a0tube of narrow diameter. The volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulb. The volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature. The small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column up the tube. The space above the mercury may be filled with\u00a0nitrogen\u00a0or it may be at less than\u00a0atmospheric pressure, a partial\u00a0vacuum. \nMercury cannot be used to measure temperatures lower than -39\u02daC (as mercury freezes at that point) or temperature higher than 356.7\u02daC (the boiling point of mercury). Mercury has been replaced largely by alcohol for use in thermometers. Ethanol is cheaper and safer than mercury and can be used as low as -80\u02daC. However, ethanol boils at 78\u00b0C (172.4\u00b0F), which means its upper limit is much lower than mercury thermometers."}

Language reforms make big changes to a language. These changes are usually done to make a language simpler to understand or to write. Sometimes changes are done to make the language purer; that is, to get rid of foreign parts of the language, or to get rid of parts of the language that are not grammatical.\nSimplification makes the language easier to use. It tries to regularise spelling, vocabulary, and grammar. Purification makes the language similar to a version of the language that people think is more pure.\nSometimes language reforms were done to unite the people speaking the language. For this reason, many language reforms happened in 19th century Europe when there was a rise of nationalist movements.\nSimplification.\nThe most common form of language reform involves changing the orthography of words. This is known as spelling reform. The grammar of a language also may be changed to simplify inflection, syntax, vocabulary and word formation. English for example uses many different prefixes that mean \"the opposite of\", like \"un-\", \"in-/im-\", \"a(n)-\", \"de-\". A language reform might suggest using only one prefix to mean \"the opposite of\", for example \"un-\". On top of this, there are words such as \"good\" and \"bad\" that roughly mean the opposite of each other, but would be better (in terms of simplicity) portrayed as \"good\" and \"ungood\", so the word \"bad\" is not part of the language anymore.\nAnother good example of what language simplification can do is the word \"flammable\". Flammable means that something can catch fire easily. Originally the word was \"inflammable\", from Latin \"inflammare\" - put something on fire. \"In-\" is also a prefix that can mean \"the opposite of\", like with \"transparent\", \"intransparent\". Today most instructions use \"flammable\" rather than \"inflammable\", in order not to confuse people that the \"in-\" in this case does not mean the opposite of.\nSeveral major world languages have been subject to big spelling reforms: French (in the 16th, 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries), Spanish (in the 18th century), Portuguese (in 1910, in Portugal, and in 1946 and 1972, in Brazil), German (in 1901/02 and 1996/98) and Russian (in 1728 and 1919).\nPurification.\nSome people feel that it is bad to change a language. They want to keep a language the way it is now, or they want to take back changes to the language that have been done earlier. Sometimes, purism can make a language more complex, because people add false etymologies:\nExamples.\nExamples of language reforms are:"}

During the Ming Dynasty, the name was changed to its present name Xi'an, meaning \"Western Peace\".\nHistory.\nThe imperial city of Chang'an during the Han Dynasty was in northwest of today's Xi'an. During the Tang Dynasty, the area to be known as Chang'an included the area inside the Ming Xi'an fortification, plus some small areas to its east and west, and a major part of its southern suburbs. The Tang Chang'an was 8 times the size of the Ming Xi'an. During this time Chang'an was one of the largest and most populous cities in the world. Around 750 A.D. Chang'an was called a \"million people's city\" in Chinese records, while modern estimates put it at around 800,000\u20131,000,000 within city walls.\nIn 710, the grid of Japan's capital city at Heij\u014d-ky\u014d was planned to mirror the grid of Chang'an.

Capitalism began its rise, beginning in northern Italian republics such as Genoa. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of feudalism, serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church.\nThe period includes the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, the European colonization of the Americas and the peak of the European hunt of witches.\nThe beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted to be in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this phase from medieval to early modern Europe are:\nThe end date of the early modern period is associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750, or the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, which drastically transformed the state of European politics.\nAmong the most important political changes of this time are the abolition of serfdom and the change of kingdoms into nation-states. Then the Reformation, that meant that Christendom was no unified entity any more. Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories. For instance, many of the Germanic states (as well as English Reformation) converted to Protestantism in an attempt to slip out of the power of the Pope.\nThe intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of mercantilism and the publication of works of political and social philosophy, such as Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" (1513) and Thomas More's \"Utopia\" (1515).\nDifference between 'early modern' and the Renaissance.\nThe expression \"early modern\" is sometimes, and incorrectly, used as a substitute for the term Renaissance. However, \"Renaissance\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments; which occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe\u2014especially central and northern Italy\u2014and span the transition from late Medieval civilization and the opening of the early modern period.\nThe term early modern is most often applied to Europe, and its overseas empire. However, in Japan, the Edo period from 1590 to 1868 is also sometimes referred to as the early modern period."}

This can be from an internal combustion engine (as in a car), water driving a water wheel, or gas or water going through a turbine. This rotating power is called torque. The load that is turned creates torsion and shear stress. Drive shafts need to be strong enough to take this stress. A light drive shaft will more efficiently move the power to the load, so there needs to be a balance between strength and weight.\nAutomobiles.\nMost automobiles today use drive shafts to deliver power from the engine to the wheels. Most cars made today are front wheel drive (the front wheels have the power to move the car). In this case, the drive shafts are between the transaxle and each front wheels.\nIn rear wheel drive cars, there are drive shafts between the differential and each rear wheel. There is also a drive shaft running the length of the car, from the transmission up front to the differential in the back - in British English this is not called a drive shaft, but a propeller shaft, or prop-shaft, and the drive shafts may be called half shafts (since there are two that make one axle). \nThere are different types of drive shafts used in automobiles:\nThe Slip in Tube Drive shaft is the new type which helps absorb energy in a crash, protecting the people in the car or truck. It is also known as a collapsible drive shaft.\nMotorcycle drive shafts.\nDrive shafts have been used on motorcycles almost as long as there have been motorcycles. Many motorcycles use a simpler chain or belt drive instead, but drive shafts need less care, and have a long life. A problem with using drive shafts on a motorcycle is that gearing is needed to turn the power 90\u00b0 from the shaft to the rear wheel, losing some power in the process.\nTractors.\nFarm tractors use a type of drive shaft called a Power Take-off shaft, or PTO shaft. This is a shaft that comes out the back of the tractor. It can be connected to any farm equipment that needs power from the tractor engine, such as a hay baler or corn chopper. \n This lets the tractor be used for a lot of different uses, and the farm equipment doesn't need its own engine, saving money.\nDrive shafts in Bicycles.\nThe drive shaft can also be used in a bicycle instead of chain-drive. They have been used for the past century, although never becoming very popular. When used on a bicycle, a drive shaft has several advantages and disadvantages:"}

The first \"power loom\" was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785, later to be perfected by William Horrocks.

James Henry Northrop invented the automatic \"weft replenishment\" loom. It revolutionized the weaving industry. Some 700,000 \"Northrop\" automatic looms were sold worldwide.\nOriginally, power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across, but in the early part of the 20th century the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximize production for specific types of material. The most common of these are air-jet looms and water-jet looms. Computer-driven looms are now also available to individual home weavers. "}

Ahmad wanted to restore Islam's original message. It was started before India was split into the modern day states of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nIn 1914, the movement split into two different groups, over a question of who should become the next Caliph. Both groups still exist today.\nMirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to have fulfilled the prophecies for the Mahdi. In addition to being a Mahdi, he was also called the Mujaddid (divine reformer) of the 14th Islamic century and the promised Messiah.\nAhmadis consider themselves Muslims and claim to practice the Islam that was taught and practised by Muhammad and his followers. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad founded the movement in 1889 and named it the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat (Community). His goal was to restore life into Islam.\nThe original Ahmadiyya movement split into two separate groups after the death of Nooruddin, the first successor of Ghulam Ahmad.\nThe original Ahmadiyya movement split into two separate groups, after the death of Nooruddin, the first successor of Ghulam Ahmad. These movements are the Ahmadiyya Community and the smaller Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam (\"Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat-i-Islam\", AAIIL). The groups have different interpretations of Ahmad's teachings and claims. They also have different opinions on the status of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and his successor, and how this person should be chosen.\nThe larger faction of the Ahmadiyya Movement, known as the Ahmadiyya Community is active in 190 countries of the world. The International Headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Community is currently in London, England. The smaller faction, known as the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, is active in 17 countries of the world. They are most notable in Germany, Australia and Pakistan. The International Headquarters of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement is in the town of Lahore, Pakistan where the Lahore Movement started. Within Lahore, Pakistan, are the \"Ahmadiyya Buildings Lahore\" which act as the international administrative base for the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement.\nControversial points include the Ahmadiyya view on the death and return of Jesus and their concept of Jihad. The Ahmadiyya community also has a different interpretation of verse Qur'an 33:40 of the Qur'an. This verse talks about Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets. The members of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement are not subject to such criticism because they do not believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was a prophet. For this reason, they are more close to traditional mainstream Islam. Although mainstream Muslims consider them as heretics. Ahmadis (particularly the members of the International Ahmadiyya Muslim Community) argue that their beliefs are in accordance with Islam, and by using arguments from the Qur'an, Hadith and opinion of Islamic jurists and theologians, challenge the contention of the groups calling them non-Muslims.\nAhmadis have translated the Qur'an in all the main languages of the world. They broadcast globally on their 24-hour satellite television channels such as MTA 1, MTA 2, MTA 3, and a recently introduced MTA Africa. Ahmadis have provided teachers, doctors and humanitarian relief workers in many developing countries. The fourth Caliph, Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad helped to promote homeopathy as a system of medicine by training practitioners through a regular TV class and establishing many free dispensaries around the world.\nCriticism.\nThe Ahmadiyyas are regarded as heretics by the orthodox Muslims because Mirza Ghulam Ahmad proclaimed himself the Mahdi of Islam as well as the second coming of Jesus. In addition, Ahmadis also differ on the interpretation of the Finality of Prophethood (, \"kh\u0101taman nabiyy\u012bn\") where orthodox Muslim consider Muhammad to be the last Prophet, in contrast to the Ahmadiyya view, where Muhammad is considered as the final law-bearing prophet. \nThus, the majority of Muslims do not refer to the Ahmadis by this name, but use the derogative term 'Qadianis' (referring to Qadian, India, the birthplace of Ahmad) and Mirzai (referring to Mirza Ahmad). These terms are used as Ahmadis are considered 'unworthy' of using the name Ahmad, an alternative name for Muhammad and therefore it is considered derogative, as it is to refer to Muslims as 'Muhammadans'."}

He stopped working as mayor to run as an MP for the House of Commons in 2015. In July 2016, Johnson became Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. He resigned this position in July 2018. This was the same day that David Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary. Jeremy Hunt became the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and Commonwealth Affairs after Johnson. \nJohnson was educated at Eton. He went to Balliol College, Oxford where he studied Classics. He began his journalism career with \"The Times.\" Later, he moved to \"The Daily Telegraph\" where he was assistant editor. He became editor of \"The Spectator\" in 1999.

He returned to work in late April.\nEarly life and education.\nBoris Johnson was born in a clinic at Upper East Side in New York City, New York. He is the eldest of the four children of Stanley Johnson. Stanley is a former Conservative MEP (Member of the European Parliament). He was also an employee of the European Commission and the World Bank. Boris Johnson's mother is the painter Charlotte Fawcett (later Wahl). She is the daughter of Sir James Fawcett, a prominent barrister and the president of the European Commission of Human Rights.\nOn his father's side Johnson is the great-grandson of Ali Kemal. Kemal was a liberal Turkish journalist and interior minister in the government of Damat Ferid Pasha, Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire. He was murdered during the Turkish War of Independence. During World War I, Boris's grandfather and great aunt were recognised as British subjects. They took their grandmother's maiden name of Johnson. Johnson has described himself as a \"one-man melting pot\" because of his cosmopolitan ancestry. His ancestors were Muslims, Jews and Christians if one counts his great-grandparents. His father's maternal (his mother's) grandmother, Marie Louise de Pfeffel, was a descendent of Prince Paul of W\u00fcrttemberg. This was due to the Prince's relationship with a German actress. Johnson is a descendent of King George II of Great Britain through Prince Paul. Johnson is also a descendent of all the previous British royal houses through George's great-great-great grandfather, King James I of England.\nJohnson and his family went back to England soon after he was born because his mother needed to take her Oxford finals.

He was educated at the European School in Brussels, Ashdown House and then at Eton College. At Eton, he was a King's Scholar. He read Classics at Balliol College, Oxford. He was a Brackenbury scholar. He was also elected President of the Oxford Union at his second attempt (try). Radek Sikorski said that Johnson acted as a supporter of the Social Democratic Party to win the Union presidency. This was because the party was popular at the university. Johnson denies he did this. He said he was only the SDP's preferred candidate. Along with David Cameron he was a member of Oxford's Bullingdon Club. The club is a student dining society known for its raucous feasts.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1987 Johnson married Allegra Mostyn-Owen. The marriage lasted less than a year. It was dissolved in 1993. He married the barrister Marina Wheeler later the same year. Wheeler is the daughter of journalist and broadcaster Sir Charles Wheeler and his Sikh Indian wife, Dip Singh. The Wheeler and Johnson families have known each other for many years. Marina Wheeler was at the European School in Brussels at the same time as Boris Johnson.

He was American because he was born in New York. In 2018, Johnson and Wheeler announced their separation and soon divorced in 2020. He later developed a relationship with Carrie Symonds around the same time he separated from Wheeler. They became engaged in late 2019. Their first son was born on 29 April 2020. He was born at University College Hospital in London. His name is Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. Symonds and Johnson got married in May 2021.\nPolitical career.\nJohnson ran for MP of Clwyd South in the 1997 general election. He lost the election. In 2001, he was elected MP for Henley. He replaced Michael Heseltine. In 2004 he became Shadow Minister for the Arts after Nick Hawkins (the Shadow Home Affairs Spokesman) resigned. Johnson was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party from November 2003. He put an emphasis on campaigning.\nJohnson was sacked from these high-profile posts in November 2004. He was accused of lying to Michael Howard about a four-year extramarital affair with Petronella Wyatt, \"The Spectator\"'s New York correspondent and former deputy editor. Johnson said the allegations were not true. He said they were \"an inverted pyramid of piffle\". However, Howard sacked Johnson because he believed press reports showed Johnson had lied, and not because of the affair itself.\nThe new Conservative Leader David Cameron made him Shadow Minister for Higher Education on 9 December 2005. Johnson resigned as editor of \"The Spectator\" soon after this. On 2 April 2006 the \"News of the World\" said that Johnson had had another extramarital affair. They said the affairwas with journalist Anna Fazackerley from the\"Times Higher Education Supplement\". A video shows him coming out her flat and waving to her in a taxi. In a speech at the University of Exeter concerning student finance, Johson allegedly made funny remarks about his gratitude to the audience for not \"raising other issues\" during the talk. This may have been a reference to the allegations about the second affair. A report in \"The Times\" said that Cameron saw the possible affair as a private matter. He said that Johnson would not lose his job over it.\n2008 London Mayoral election.\nJohnson told the press he may be a Conservative candidate for the London mayoral election in 2008 on 16 July 2007. Reports said he declared that \"the opportunity is too great and the prize too wonderful to miss ... the chance to represent London and speak for Londoners\". He resigned as Shadow Minister for Higher Education. A public London wide primary gave him 75% of the vote. He was confirmed as the Conservative candidate on 27 September 2007. \nMayor of London.\nAlcohol use ban on public transport.\nOn 7 May 2008, Johnson said he wanted to ban (stop) people drinking alcohol on the London transport system. This was meant to start on 1 June. Jeroen Weimar, Transport for London's director of transport policing and enforcement, said this was reasonable. He said people should be more considerate on trains. The ban initially applied on the London Underground, Buses, DLR and Croydon Trams. The London Overground was added later in June 2008. Press releases said that the ban was for \"stations across the capital\". It did not say if this included National Rail stations - especially the stations not served by the TfL lines on which alcohol is banned.\nThousands of drinkers used the Underground system on the last evening on which alcohol was allowed to mark the event. Six London Underground stations had to close because of the trouble. Drinkers assaulted a number of staff and police. Police made 17 arrests. Drinkers damaged several trains. The trains were withdrawn from service.\n2008 Olympics.\nJohnson was present at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He was London's representative to receive the Olympic flag from Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing. This was to formally announce London as Olympic host city for 2012. The Chinese media said he was \"rude, arrogant and disrespectful\" for accepting the Olympic flag with one hand, putting his hands in his pockets and not buttoning up his jacket. Later, at a party held at London House in Beijing, Johnson gave a speech in which he declared \"ping pong is coming home\".\nMP (since 2015).\nIn August 2014, Johnson said that he would run as the Conservative candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. He became the party's candidate in September. In the May 2015 general election Johnson won the election. He became MP. Some thought he ran for MP to replace David Cameron as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\nBrexit.\nIn February 2016, Johnson supported Vote Leave for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016. After Johnson said he wanted to leave the European Union, Brexit approval dropped nearly 2% to its lowest level since March 2009. \nOn 22 June 2016, Johnson said that 23 June could be \"Britain's independence day\" in a televised debate in front of a 6000-member audience at Wembley Arena. David Cameron, British Prime Minister at the time, talked about Johnson's claim. He said: \"the idea that our country isn't independent is nonsense. This whole debate demonstrates our sovereignty.\"\nDavid Cameron resigned as Prime Minister after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Johnson was the favourite to be the new Prime Minister. However, Johnson announced he would not stand in the Conservative leadership election.\nForeign Secretary (2016\u20132018).\nTheresa May became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister. In July 2016, she appointed Johnson Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Many saw that this appointment made his political power weaker. Barack Obama was critical of Johnson after Johnson made a racist remark to Obama. This was after Obama said he wanted the U.K. to stay in the European Union.\nIn May 2018, Johnson supported the Iran Nuclear deal. This is something that President Donald Trump did not support. After the Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, Johnson compared Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler.\nJohnson has been accused of sexism, corruption and racism during his political career.\nJohnson resigned as Foreign Secretary in July 2018. This was after Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit agreements failed.\nPrime Minister (since 2019).\n2019 leadership race.\nOn 16 May 2019, Johnson announced his plans to run for Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in the 2019 election. He got through the first round of voting with 114 Conservative MPs voting for him. He later won all future ballots by large numbers. He was part of the final two candidates with Jeremy Hunt on 20 June.\nThe members' vote closed on 22 July. The result was announced on 23 July. Johnson was elected leader with 92,153 votes (66.4%) to Hunt's 46,656 votes (33.6%). He formally replaced Theresa May as Prime Minister on 24 July after a meeting with the Queen.\n2019 general election.\nOn 29 October 2019, Johnson announced that the next general election would happen on 12 December 2019. He wanted the Conservatives to win a majority in parliament to pass a Brexit bill. The election result was a landslide Conservative victory. They won with an overall majority of about 80 seats. The result was the worst for the Labour Party since 1935.\nReferences.\nNotes"}

One of the chemical elements in this compound is iron. \nResearchers have experimented replacing some of the iron atoms in Prussian blue with cobalt. When the Prussian blue compound is lit with a red light at -150 C, the compound shifts from being non-magnetic (off) to magnetic (on). The magnetic shift does not change back except if deliberately reversed (or undone) with heat.\nThis magnetism is due to the transfer of an electron from the cobalt to the iron, with light providing the energy, while the electron moves back when heat is applied, the researchers said.\nThis magnetic property means the compound can be used in computer storage. Because the compound can be turned \"on\" and \"off\" in a controlled way, it can remember binary information. Binary information is used for computer storage.\nThis way of using the compound is still being developed.\nIt is also used as a machinists dye to check wear patterns."}

Watson, and added the idea of operant conditioning. These two American psychologists paid no attention to mental states and 'thinking' (terms they thought were unscientific), but dealt only with visible behaviors. Skinner's work had effects on education (programmed learning) and on behavior therapy for various psychological problems. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1974, and then Emeritus Professor until 1990.\nSkinner was also a social philosopher who wanted to change society, and wrote a eutopian novel, in which the science of human behavior is used to eliminate poverty, sexual oppression, government as we know it, and create a lifestyle without war. He wrote poetry, and three volumes of autobiography.\nLife.\nSkinner was born in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania to Grace and William Skinner.\nHis father was a lawyer. Skinner became an atheist after a liberal Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the Hell that his grandmother described.\nSkinner attended Harvard University after receiving his B.A. in English literature in 1926. After graduation, he spent a year at his parents' home in Scranton attempting to become a writer of fiction. He tried to become a writer in Greenwich Village. He soon became disillusioned with his literary skills and concluded that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with John B. Watson's \"Behaviorism\" led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own operant behaviorism.\nSkinner received a PhD from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis and later at Indiana University, where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946\u20131947. He returned to Harvard in 1948, and stayed there for the rest of his career.\nIn 1936, Skinner married Yvonne Blue. The couple had two daughters, Julie (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. Buzan). He died of leukemia on August 18, 1990, and is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts."}

He has twice held the leading political role in London local government. First, he was leader of the Greater London Council from 1981 until the council was abolished in 1986. Secondly, he was the first Mayor of London, from its creation in 2000 until 2008. He also served as Labour Party Member of Parliament for Brent East between 1987 and 2001.\nHe was elected Mayor of London as an Independent candidate after the Labour Party decided not to nominate him as their candidate in the first mayoral elections. In January 2004, he was re-admitted to the Labour Party. As the official Labour Party candidate for Mayor in the June 2004 elections, he won with a total of 828,380 first- and second-preference votes. On 1 May 2008 Livingstone was defeated in his second re-election bid by Conservative candidate Boris Johnson, and his term as Mayor of London ended on 4 May 2008.\nEarly and personal life.\nLivingstone was born in Lambeth, London, England, the son of Ethel Ada (Kennard), a professional dancer, and Robert Moffat Livingstone, who was of Scottish descent and worked as a ship's master in the Merchant Navy. Livingstone has described his parents as \"working class Tories\".\nLivingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive School. He did not pass the eleven-plus examination in 1956 but still managed to obtain a few O-levels. He worked for eight years as a cancer research technician, between 1962 and 1970. He also trained as a teacher, qualifying in 1973, but was never active in the profession. Livingstone joined the Labour Party in 1968 at a time when party membership was falling and few new young members were joining, and rose rapidly in the local party. He was elected to the Lambeth Borough Council in May 1971 and served as Vice-Chair of the Housing Committee from 1971 to 1973 (succeeding John Major in the job).\nAt the Greater London Council Election in 1973 elections Livingstone won the Norwood seat on the Greater London Council (GLC) and served as Vice-Chair of Housing Management in 1974-1975. He was dismissed when he opposed spending cuts urged by council leader Sir Reg Goodwin. He also served on the movie censorship committee and urged the abolition of censorship. Coming up to the Greater London Council Election of 1977, Livingstone realised that it would be difficult to retain his seat and managed to be selected for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, a safe seat, following the retirement of Dr David Pitt, Baron Pitt of Hampstead. This ensured that he was one of the few left-wing Labour councillors to remain on the council.\nLivingstone had been selected as the Labour Parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead constituency. He moved to Camden just before the deadline to stand for the council in 1978, and was elected there. Livingstone's performance in Hampstead in the United Kingdom 1979 general election was good, although he did not come close to winning what was at that time a safe Conservative seat.\nHe married Christine Pamela Chapman in 1973 and the marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Around that time he became involved with Kate Allen (Amnesty International UK), now director of Amnesty International in the UK, but the couple separated in November 2001.\nLivingstone and his current partner Emma Beal, also his office manager, have a son, Thomas, born 14 December 2002 at the University College Hospital, London, and a daughter, Mia, born on 20 March 2004 at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. He also has three other children from previous relationships, whose existence was only publicly revealed during the London mayoral election in 2008. Livingstone is a noted \"bon vivant\", having twice worked as a food critic for London's \"Evening Standard\" newspaper and various magazines.\nHe is known for his enthusiasm for keeping and breeding newts.\nLivingstone in parliament.\nLivingstone again stood for Parliament in the 1987 general election, winning a seat in the north-west London constituency of Brent East. He replaced Labour MP Reg Freeson who was a committed left-winger, but his relatively moderate (\"sensible left\") views made him vulnerable to the hard left in the early 1980s. Freeson was able to retain his seat at the 1983 general election, but was deselected in 1985 after a bitter struggle, described as \"political 'murder'\" in his Guardian obituary, and replaced as Labour candidate in Brent East by Livingstone.\nIn his maiden speech to Parliament in July 1987, Livingstone used Parliamentary privilege to raise a number of allegations made by Fred Holroyd, a former MI6 operative in Northern Ireland. Despite the convention of maiden speeches being non-controversial, Livingstone alleged that Holroyd had been mistreated when he tried to expose MI5 collusion with loyalist paramilitaries in the 1970s and the part Captain Robert Nairac is alleged to have played. He also voiced Colin Wallace's allegations of MI5 dirty tricks levelled at Harold Wilson, part of what became known as the \"Wilson plot\".\nAs a Labour backbencher, Livingstone lost the public platform he possessed as head of the GLC; furthermore, his brand of radical socialism was increasingly out of step with the Labour leadership, which had moved sharply towards the centre under the leadership of Neil Kinnock who now blamed left-wingers like Livingstone for Labour's 'unelectability.' Over the long term, though, it was Livingstone rather than Kinnock who was to achieve electoral success. In September 1987 he was elected to the party's National Executive Committee, although he lost this position two years later; he regained it in 1997 beating Peter Mandelson in what some interpreted as a rebuke to Tony Blair. He was re-elected MP in the general election of 1992, with a 6% swing to Labour in his Brent East constituency. Besides serving in the Commons, Livingstone held a number of other 'odd jobs' during this period, including game show contestant and host, after-dinner speaker, and restaurant reviewer for the \"Evening Standard\". In 1987 he published an autobiography-cum-political tract, \"If Voting Changed Anything They'd Abolish It\".\nAs a politician comfortable in light-hearted and satirical situations, in 1990, Livingstone made the first of seven appearances on the topical panel show \"Have I Got News For You\". For a long time, his first six appearances would stand as the show's record; his current tally of seven - the last being in 2002 - fall one short of the record for guest appearances currently held by Germaine Greer and Will Self.\nIn 1995, Livingstone appeared on the track \"Ernold Same\" by the band Blur, taken from the album \"The Great Escape\". Livingstone provided spoken word vocals and was listed as 'The Right On Ken Livingstone.'\nLivingstone appeared in one of a series of advertisements extolling the virtues of cheese in the 1980s, appropriately endorsing red Leicester. On the other side of politics, Edward Heath advertised Danish Blue. Their respective choices are down to the colour red being associated with the Labour Party, and blue with the Conservative Party.\nGreater London's first mayor.\nLivingstone was again re-elected in the 1997 general election, in which Labour was returned to power under the leadership of Tony Blair. Among Labour's proposals was the establishment of a Greater London Authority which was to be a strategic body: unlike the GLC the Greater London Authority would not provide any services to Londoners directly. The new Greater London Authority would be headed by a directly-elected mayor, who would be watched over by a 25-member Assembly.\nDespite having earlier criticised the specific proposals for a new London-wide authority, Livingstone was widely tipped for the new post of Mayor. The mayoral election was scheduled for 2000, and in 1999, Labour began the long and trying process of selecting its candidate. Despite Blair's personal antipathy, Livingstone was included on Labour's shortlist in November 1999, having pledged that he would not run as an independent if he failed to secure the party's nomination. William Hague, then Leader of the Opposition taunted Blair at Prime Minister's Question Time: \"Why not split the job in two, with Frank Dobson as your day mayor and Ken Livingstone as your nightmare?\"\nLabour chose its official candidate on 20 February 2000. Although Livingstone received a healthy majority of the total votes, he nevertheless lost the nomination to former Secretary of State for Health Frank Dobson, under a controversial system in which votes from sitting Labour MPs and MEPs were weighted more heavily than votes from rank-and-file members. On 6 March, Livingstone announced that he would run against Dobson as an independent, confirming speculation that he would renege on his earlier pledge. He was suspended from the Labour Party the same day and expelled on 4 April. Tony Blair said that Livingstone as mayor would be a \"disaster\" for London; he later said he was wrong in that prediction.\nThe result of the election \u2013 held on 4 May \u2013 was a foregone conclusion: Dobson, who it was alleged, had been pressured into running by the party leadership, unsuccessfully based his campaign on claims that Livingstone was an egomaniac, and the Conservatives remained becalmed after their catastrophic national defeat in 1997. Livingstone came out ahead in the first round of balloting with 38% of first-preference votes to Conservative Steven Norris's 27%; Dobson finished third, with 13% of all first-preference votes \u2013 just ahead of Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer, with 12%. Under the modified instant-runoff voting system employed for the election, only the votes cast for Livingstone and Norris were considered in the second round, where Livingstone won with 58% of first- and second-preference votes, versus 42% for Norris.\nLivingstone continued to sit in parliament, as an independent having had the Labour whip withdrawn, until standing down at the 2001 General Election.\n2004 re-election.\nLivingstone applied for readmittance to the Labour Party in 2002 but was rejected. In November 2003, however, rumours emerged that the Labour Party would allow Livingstone to rejoin, just ahead of the 2004 London mayoral election. Opinion polls consistently gave a poor showing to Labour's official candidate, Nicky Gavron, and many in the party leadership (including Tony Blair himself) feared that Labour would be humiliated by a fourth-place finish. In mid-December, Gavron announced she would stand down as the Labour candidate in favour of a 'unity campaign,' with Gavron as Livingstone's deputy, with Labour's National Executive Committee voting 25-2 to pave the way for Livingstone's readmittance. The deal hinged on a 'loyalty test' administered by a special five-member NEC panel on 9 January. The panel recommended that Livingstone be allowed back in the party. The move towards readmittance came amid considerable opposition from senior party members, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, and former party leader Neil Kinnock. In a ballot of Labour Party members in London, Livingstone was overwhelmingly endorsed as the Labour candidate for the 2004 Mayoral election.\nLivingstone was re-elected Mayor of London on 10 June 2004. He won 36% of first preference votes to Conservative Steven Norris's 28% and Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes's 15%. Six other candidates shared the remainder of the votes. When all the candidates except Livingstone and Norris were eliminated and the second preferences of those voters who had picked neither Livingstone or Norris as their first choice were counted, Livingstone won with 55% to Norris's 45%.\n2008 Election.\nLivingstone sought re-election in 2008, but was defeated by Conservative candidate Boris Johnson on a night that saw the Labour Party suffer its worst electoral defeats for forty years. Once first and second votes were taken into account Johnson had 1,168,738 votes, Livingstone 1,028,966 - a margin of 139, 772 votes or just over 6% of those who voted.\nSpeaking immediately after the count, Johnson paid public tribute to his defeated rival, praising \"the very considerable achievements of the last mayor of London\" and describing Livingstone as \"a very considerable public servant\". Johnson went on to say \"You shaped the office of mayor. You gave it national prominence and when London was attacked on 7 July 2005 you spoke for London.\"\nJohnson also spoke of Livingstone's \"courage and the sheer exuberant nerve with which you stuck it to your enemies\" and expressed a desire that the new Conservative administration could \"discover a way in which the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London\".\nActs as mayor.\nPublic transport.\nLivingstone's greatest challenge as Mayor of London has been dealing with the city's ageing transportation infrastructure. Despite conflict over appropriate funding schemes and engineering challenges to modernising both the London Underground and the city's bus system, an Association of London Government survey, conducted by MORI towards the end of Livingstone's first term in 2004, suggested growing public satisfaction with public transport, with buses in particular being seen as more frequent and reliable.\nIn accordance with his pre-election pledge, bus fares were frozen for four years, but then the standard single cash fare on buses more than doubled. Further, and contrary to his pledge during his first election campaign, when he said \"only a de-humanised moron would get rid of the Routemaster\", Livingstone removed the famous Routemaster buses from routine service on 9 December 2005, claiming it was because the new buses were wheelchair-accessible, although several of the old buses are used on shortened \"heritage routes\". There was some question over the legality of using the old Routemaster under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as the Routemasters effectively banned wheel chair users.\nIn tandem with the removal of Routemaster buses, Livingstone oversaw the introduction of bending articulated buses. These buses have faced criticism for allegedly being fire-prone, dangerous to cyclists, and unable to navigate some winding streets; see London articulated bus controversy.\nLivingstone has been a strong proponent of the Oyster card smartcard ticketing system for London's public transport network introduced in 2003. In late 2005, Livingstone proposed large fare increases for on-the-spot tickets across the Tube and bus network to encourage regular travellers to use the automated Oyster system to reduce queuing at Underground stations and avoid delays in conductorless buses as drivers issue tickets. The plans, although ratified by the GLA and introduced in January 2006 were condemned by those who argued that the increases would increase the cost of travelling in London to tourists and others who do not travel regularly. Civil liberties groups have expressed concern over the way in which Transport for London is able to track the movements of passengers using the Oyster card system. Livingstone moved to make all bus journeys free for passengers under the age of 18 enrolled in full-time education who travel with an Oyster card and introduced initiatives to enable visitors to buy an Oyster card before arriving in London.\nOne of the key points of conflict between Livingstone and the Labour Party had been the proposed 'Public-Private Partnership' for the London Underground. Livingstone had run in 2000 on a policy of financing the improvements to Tube infrastructure by a public bond issue, which had been done in the case of the New York City Subway. However the Mayor did not have power in this area at the time as the Underground operated independently of Transport for London. The PPP deal went ahead in July 2002, but it did not diminish Livingstone's desire to re-join Labour. Metronet, one of the winners of the contract for PPP, subsequently went into administration in July 2007.\nCongestion charge.\nLivingstone introduced the London congestion charge with the purpose of reducing traffic congestion in central London. Since being introduced the charge has proved to be controversial, though Transport for London maintains that traffic has fallen by 20% within the charge zone since the scheme began. One reason for the controversy is that whilst the scheme has been lucrative for its private-sector operator, Capita, some people argue it has not made enough money for public transport because the money has been spent on other things.\nHowever, its apparent success in reducing congestion has led to similar schemes being proposed in other major cities such as New York.\nIn November 2003, Livingstone was named 'Politician of the Year' by the Political Studies Association, which said his scheme was 'bold and imaginative'.\nThe United States Embassy for many years has refused to pay the charge because they argue it is a tax and not a charge on congestion.\nEnvironmental policies.\nKen Livingstone has been called \u201can environmentalist, a leftist, a lover of newts,\" and has made a significant effort to reduce London\u2019s impact on the environment. He began by creating the London Hydrogen Partnership and the London Energy Partnership in his first term as Mayor of London. The Mayor\u2019s Energy Strategy , \u201cgreen light to clean power,\u201d commits London to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide by 20%, relative to the 1990 level, by 2010. However, he does support the Thames Gateway Bridge in East London that Friends of the Earth say \"would bring few benefits to the local people and lead to more traffic, more noise and air pollution and an increase in climate-changing emissions\". In October 2007, London Councils stated Livingstone had gone back on his promise to help chair the developing London Waste and Recycling Board, and to provide \u00a36 million of funding for the project, because \"the government had failed to provide him with absolute control of the Board.\"\nIn June 2007, Livingstone criticised a planned \u00a3200 million desalination plant at Beckton, which would be the United Kingdom's first, calling it \"misguided and a retrograde step in UK environmental policy\", and that \"we should be encouraging people to use less water, not more.\"\nSame-sex civil partnerships.\nIn 2001 Livingstone set up Britain's first register for same-sex couples; while falling short of legal marriage rights, the register was seen as a \"step towards\" such rights. Legal status was later passed by the government through the Civil Partnership Act 2004.\nReligious and other festivals.\nAfter rejecting the idea for a couple of years, Livingstone hosted a Jewish Hanukkah ceremony at City Hall in December 2005. He said he intended this to be an annual occurrence. On 17 March 2002 Livingstone introduced an annual Saint Patrick's Day festival to London to celebrate the contributions of the Irish to London, with around 250,000 people annually turning out for this. On 28 October 2006 he helped organise the first ever \"Eid in the Square\" in Trafalgar Square, in commemoration of the Eid ul-Fitr festival which marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting.\nReaction to 7 July 2005 London bombings.\nAfter the 7 July 2005 London bombings Livingstone, from the 117th IOC Session in Singapore, where it had recently been announced London would host the 2012 Olympic Games, delivered a speech.\nFinally, I wish to speak directly to those who came to London today to take life. I know that you personally do not fear giving up your own life in order to take others - that is why you are so dangerous. But I know you fear that you may fail in your long-term objective to destroy our free society and I can show you why you will fail. In the days that follow, look at our airports, look at our sea ports and look at our railway stations and, even after your cowardly attack, you will see that people from the rest of Britain, people from around the world will arrive in London to become Londoners and to fulfill their dreams and achieve their potential. They choose to come to London, as so many have come before because they come to be free, they come to live the life they choose, they come to be able to be themselves. They flee you because you tell them how they should live. They do not want that and nothing you do, however many of us you kill, will stop that flight to our city where freedom is strong and where people can live in harmony with one another. Whatever you do, however many you kill, you will fail.\nLivingstone defended the police after the mistaken killing of a Brazilian man, Jean Charles de Menezes, who police believed was a suicide bomber.\nRacism policies.\nIn 2001 Livingstone revived the free anti-racism Music festival now called . He believes that this, along with other anti-racist policies, is why London has seen a 35% decrease in racist attacks.\nIn September 2005 Livingstone came out in support of placing a statue of Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa, on the north terrace of Trafalgar Square. Livingstone said \"There can be no better place than our greatest square to place a statue of Nelson Mandela so that every generation can remind the next of the fight against racism.\" He was highly critical of the Planning and City Development Committee of Westminster City Council who refused planning permission.\nIn 2008 Livingstone's race advisor Lee Jasper resigned after being accused of corruption and inappropriate behaviour. Simon Woolley of Operation Black Vote has said the 2008 Mayoral campaign has seen a \"wholly disproportionate\" focus on Jasper, Doreen Lawrence (Livingstone supporter and mother of Stephen Lawrence), and others.\nApology for London's role in the transatlantic slave trade.\nOn 23 August 2007, at 12pm, Mayor Ken Livingstone formally apologised for London's role in the transatlantic slave trade. In a bicentennial day memorial event, he also called for the 23 August to be named as a national day for remembrance in the UK for the \"horrific crime against humanity of the transatlantic slave trade.\" He went on to make the following tearful speech and formal apology:\n\"It is because it is the anniversary of the biggest slave revolt in history, that UNESCO officially marks this day, the 23 August, the anniversary of that outbreak in Haiti, as slavery's official remembrance day. This is why we, in London, call for it to be the annual slave memorial day. We are therefore here to initiate London's annual slavery memorial day, and call for the establishment of a national, annual memorial day. In 1999, Liverpool became the first major British slaving city to formally apologise. The Church of England soon followed suit. In March I invited representatives of London's institutions to join the City of Liverpool and the Church of England for formally apologising for London's role in this monstrous crime. As Mayor, I offer an apology on behalf of London and its institutions for their role in the transatlantic slave trade.\"\nRejecting the idea that it is not possible to \"meaningfully apologise for something a former generation did,\" Livingstone emphasised that London and by implication the rest of the developed world still profited enormously from the assets accumulated in the slave era, adding \"It was the racial murder of not just those who were transported but generations of enslaved African men, women and children. To justify this murder and torture black people had to be declared inferior or not human. We live with the consequences today.\"\nControversy.\nCronyism and corruption allegations.\nIn March 2002, while still independent, Livingstone was accused of \"cronyism\" by some Labour party members in the London Assembly after he had appointed six officials as special advisers at a salary level which seemed to them excessive, and a manoeuvre to help his chances of being re-elected. Livingstone denied the allegations and stated the appointments were a \"necessary efficiency drive.\"\nIn December 2007, the \"Evening Standard\" published news of an investigation into grants worth \u00a32.5 million paid to organisations in which Ken Livingstone's adviser Lee Jasper was involved. It is confirmed that some of these grants were paid directly by the mayor's office.\nFollowing Mr. Livingstone\u2019s defeat in the 2008 Mayoral Elections, \"The Daily Mail\" reported that \u201cEight 'cronies' of Ken Livingstone are to receive \u00a31.6 million in pay-offs following his defeat in the London mayoral elections.\u201d Mr. Livingstone changed the rules for political appointees who would otherwise not have been eligible for severance packages, which paved the way for the eight City Hall advisors to receive an average of \u00a3200,000. Liberal Democrat Leader Dee Doocey stated that the payments were \u201ccompletely inexcusable\u201d and added that \u201cIt seems like there's one law for the ordinary working person and one law for the political class.\u201d Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cI think most people will be shocked. You could do quite a lot about knife crime with \u00a31.6 million. It is odd indeed that the full benefits of labour laws designed to protect the vulnerable are being claimed by courtiers who knew they would lose their jobs if their master lost the election.\u201d \nMr Livinstone refuted the comments by stating that 'It's a question of what the law requires. Either there's a legal responsibility or there is not.'\nDispute with the \"Evening Standard\".\nKen Livingstone was publicly criticised in February 2005 for remarks made to an \"Evening Standard\" reporter, comparing him to a Nazi concentration camp guard, after the reporter had tried to interview him following a reception marking the 20th anniversary of Chris Smith's coming out as gay. The reporter, Oliver Finegold, was in fact Jewish and said he took offence at the remarks, but Livingstone refused to withdraw the remark and was subsequently accused of antisemitism. Finegold had an audio recorder running. \"The Evening Standard\" decided not to run the story at first but the following transcript of the conversation was published by \"guardian.co.uk\":\nThe epithet \"German war criminal\" and Livingstone's subsequent jibes refer to the Standard's owners, the Daily Mail and General Trust, which endorsed Oswald Mosley's Fascists in 1934 and supported Nazism until 1939. Livingstone also claimed the \"Standard\" was guilty of \"harassment of a predominantly lesbian and gay event\". Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell suggested in the Evening Standard that this explanation \"came across as patronising. Gay people don't need the Mayor's protection to fend off a journalist asking simple questions.\"\nAfter listening to the recording supplied by Finegold, the London Assembly voted unanimously to ask Livingstone to apologise. Livingstone responded by saying \"the form of words I have used are right. I have nothing to apologise for.\" Deputy Mayor Nicky Gavron, herself the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, said of Livingstone: \"These were inappropriate words and very offensive, both to the individual and to Jews in London.\" Some two dozen complaints were referred to the Standards Board for England, the body responsible for English local government standards, which passed it to the Adjudication Panel for England, which has the power to ban individuals from public office for five years.\nThe Adjudication Panel addressed the case over two days on the 13 &amp; 14 December 2005 and adjourned the hearing for two months. On 24 February 2006, Ken Livingstone was found guilty of bringing his office into disrepute and suspended from office for four weeks, stating that he seemed \"to have failed... to have appreciated that his conduct was unacceptable\". Livingstone attacked the decision on the grounds that the Adjudication Panel members ought not to suspend a democratically elected official from power, describing their actions as \"striking at the heart of democracy\". The ban was due to begin on 1 March 2006, but on 28 February, a High Court judge postponed it pending an appeal by Livingstone.\nThe decision was later quashed by the High Court of Justice when on 5 October, Mr Justice Collins overturned the suspension, regardless of the outcome of Livingstone's appeal concerning the breach of standards. The final judgment upheld Livingstone's appeal and stated that the Adjudication Panel had misdirected itself, although the judge stated that the Mayor should have apologised.\nOn 7 December 2006, at a City Hall reception marking the launch of the London Jewish Forum, Livingstone apologised for any offence that he had caused the Jewish community.\nCriticism of Livingstone by the Evening Standard intensified during the 2008 campaign, with daily front page articles attacking him, under the direction of editor Veronica Wadley who originally urged Johnson to stand and who is closely linked to Tory leadership. According to articles in The Guardian and Time Out London, she is strongly influenced by the need to renew Associated Newspaper's multi-million pound contract to deliver the Metro free paper in London Underground stations in 2010, a decision within the gift of the Mayor.\nForeign policy.\nRemarks over foreign policy.\nIn 2004 Livingstone said \"I just long for the day I wake up and find that the Saudi Royal Family are swinging from lamp-posts and they've got a proper government that represents the people of Saudi Arabia.\"\nIn a March 2005 commentary in \"The Guardian\" he accused Israel's prime minister Ariel Sharon of being a \"war criminal\", citing his alleged personal responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982 and accusations of ethnic cleansing. Accusations that Sharon was implicated are frequently made by other organisations and leading politicians including the official Israeli Kahan Commission investigation into the massacres in 1982.\nOn 20 July 2005, Livingstone made the following comments in a BBC interview about the role of foreign policy as a motivation for the London bombings of two weeks earlier:\n\"I think you've just had 80 years of western intervention into predominantly Arab lands because of the western need for oil. We've propped up unsavoury governments, we've overthrown ones we didn't consider sympathetic. And I think the particular problem we have at the moment is that in the 1980s\u00a0... the Americans recruited and trained Osama Bin Laden, taught him how to kill, to make bombs, and set him off to kill the Russians and drive them out of Afghanistan. They didn't give any thought to the fact that once he'd done that he might turn on his creators. A lot of young people see the double standards, they see what happens in Guantanamo Bay, and they just think that there isn't a just foreign policy.\"\nLater in the interview he stated, about the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip:\n\"Under foreign occupation and denied the right to vote, denied the right to run your own affairs, often denied the right to work for three generations, I suspect that if it had happened here in England, we would have produced a lot of suicide bombers ourselves.\"\nCommentator Mark Steyn described the interview as Livingstone \"artfully\" attempting \"to draw a distinction between Muslim terrorists blowing up his own public transit (which he didn't approve of) and Muslim terrorists blowing up Israeli public transit (which he was inclined to be sympathetic to).\"\nIn November 2003, Livingstone made headlines for referring to US President George W. Bush as 'the greatest threat to life on this planet,' just before Bush's official visit to the UK. Livingstone also organised an alternative 'Peace Reception' at City Hall 'for everybody who is not George Bush,' with anti-war Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic as the guest of honour. In 2004 he referred to Bush as \"the most corrupt American president since Harding in the Twenties\". In July 2007 Livingstone suggested that Prime Minister Gordon Brown needed to explain to Bush \"that US governments need to return to a realistic view of the world. The US is the world's single most powerful country, but much weaker than the rest of the world put together. The attempt by one country to unilaterally impose itself on the rest of the world is not only undesirable but simply won't work.\"\nVenezuelan oil deal.\nIn February 2007, Ken Livingstone signed a deal with Venezuela to provide cheaper oil for London buses. In return, the Greater London Authority advises Venezuela on recycling, waste management, traffic and reducing carbon emissions. This deal came under criticism from the London Assembly Conservatives including Richard Barnes, who stated that the \"money would be better directed at the poor of Venezuela,\" and journalist Martin Bright, who said that the deal \"effectively takes from the poor of Latin America to give to one of the richest cities in the world.\" Prices have been slashed by 20%; following this, half-price bus travel became available to Londoners on income support. Livingstone stated the plan \"rises on the suggestion of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and builds on the work his government is doing around the world in tackling the problems of poverty,\" and also said, \"This will make it cheaper and easier for people to go about their lives and get the most out of London. The agreement... will also benefit the people of Venezuela, by providing expertise in areas of city management in which London is a world leader.\"\nThe deal was discontinued by incoming mayor Boris Johnson (effective from September 2008), a decision criticized by Livingstone.\nDispute with embassies over payment of congestion charge.\nA dispute with the US Embassy in London over payment of the London Congestion Charge escalated on 27 March 2006 when Livingstone criticised the Embassy's decision not to pay. The Embassy argued that the charge is a form of taxation, not a charge for a service, and diplomats and their staff are therefore exempt under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Embassy officials have never paid the charge, which was instituted in 2003. Livingstone, however, alleged that the decision was made by Robert Tuttle, who took up the post of Ambassador in July 2005. Livingstone described Tuttle as \"one of George Bush's closest cronies and a big funder of his election campaign\" and said he was trying to \"skive out of [paying] like some chiselling little crook\". The group Liberty and Law reported this remark to the Standards Board for England as a breach of its code, but the board chose not to investigate it.\nGermany stopped paying the charge in 2005, Japan followed in 2006, and in 2007 France, Russia, Belgium, and 50 other missions followed suit when the zone extended to their missions' locations (Iran, Sweden and Syria continue to pay the charge). Asked about Japan's refusal to pay in a March 2007 interview on LBC Radio, Livingstone responded, \"I think there are several problems with Japan that we could go on about here. Admitting their guilt for all the war crimes would be one thing. So if they've not got round to doing that, I doubt they're too worried about the congestion charge.\" London's Japanese embassy responded that their government had already apologised for previous war crimes.\nPost-mayoral career.\nLivingstone acted as a stand-in presenter on London talk radio station LBC 97.3's Jeni Barnett for a week beginning on 30 June 2008. In July 2008 he announced his intention to run again for the office of Mayor of London at the next mayoral elections and signalled his intent to organise a \"progressive alliance\" of political parties (such as the Labour Party and the Green Party), trade unions and interest groups to defend the progress which was made during his terms as Mayor and to prepare for the next mayoral elections.\nOn 28 August 2008, it was announced that Livingstone will be an adviser on urban planning to Caracas, Venezuela. He will act as a consultant on the capital's policing, transport and other municipal issues. As a friend of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Livingstone was appointed personally by him to advise officials and mayoral candidates in Caracas, in order to help transform the city, which journalist Rory Carroll described as suffering from, \"Gridlocked traffic, a crumbling centre, hillside slums, horrific murder rates, corrupt police and inept local government\". Livingstone reckoned that in twenty years a \"first-world city\" can be made out of Caracas, stating, \"I have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which I will be calling on to assist in this.\" No decision on a salary for the ex-mayor has been made, although he mentioned that, \"The whole cost of this trip has been paid for by the government of Venezuela and as an unemployed citizen I would not be able to pay for my own fare otherwise.\" The appointment follows on from the controversy surrounding the deal brokered by Livingstone in February 2007 for the Greater London Authority and Transport for London to provide advice to Venezuela in exchange for cheap fuel to help with bus subsidies. The deal was later overturned by new mayor Boris Johnson, and Livingstone offered his services to Ch\u00e1vez so that Venezuela gets the \"advice that we promised\". Livingstone played down any accusations that his close relationship with the Venezuelan President was controversial, \"unless you believe American propaganda\", while a spokesperson for Johnson said, \"Ken Livingstone is free, as a private individual, to offer his advice and services to whomever he wants.\" Livingstone is now being touted as a key asset for Ch\u00e1vez in the upcoming November elections in the country."}

It lies in the south-east of the island, covering more than 8% of the country. \nThe average thickness of the ice is 400 m, with a maximum thickness of 1,000 m. Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshn\u00fakur (2,110 m), is located at the southern tip of Vatnaj\u00f6kull, near Skaftafell National Park. It is classified as an ice cap glacier.\nVatnaj\u00f6kull has been shrinking for some years now, possibly because of climatic changes and recent volcanic activity. Until 1930 it was growing. \nAccording to Guinness World Records Vatnaj\u00f6kull is the object of the world's longest sight line, 550\u00a0km from Sl\u00e6ttaratindur, the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands. GWR state that \"owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction, Vatnaj\u00f6kull (2119m), Iceland, can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands, 340 miles (550\u00a0km) away\". This may be based on a claimed sighting by a British sailor in 1939. The validity of this record is analysed/undermined in mathematical and atmospheric detail by J.C. de Ferranti "}

It was created by nationalization under the Transport Act 1945. Britain's railways were returned to private ownership by privatization in 2001.\nHistory.\nGreat Britain.\nAfter the smaller firms were merged in 1923 under the Railways Act 1921, there were four large regional railway companies. The Big Four were the Great Western Railway (GWR), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the Southern Railway (SR). The Transport Act 1947 made provision for the nationalisation of the network.\nThe Second World War had caused damage to all the railways. They had lost a large part of their trains, buildings and equipment.\nThe Transport Act 1947 set out the nationalisation of the rail network, as part of a plan by Clement Attlee's Labour Government to nationalise public transport. The London Underground, some industrial lines and some remaining light railways like Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway were again excluded. For a short time, during World War II, the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway line was taken over by the military. After the war the line re-opened to public use in 1946. The Bicester Military Railway had been built by the government in 1941.\nThe Transport Act 1947 took effect on 1 January 1923. By that date most of the mergers had taken place, some from the previous year. The \"Railway Magazine\" in its issue of February 1923 dubbed the new companies as \"The Big Four of the New Railway Era\".\nThese \"Big Four\" were:\nSee also a list of railway companies involved in the 1923 grouping.\nNorthern Ireland.\nThe nationalised Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) ran the railways in Northern Ireland from 1948 until 1966. They were then taken over by Translink and called \"NI Railways,\" also known as \"Northern Ireland Railways\" ().\nThe government of Northern Ireland and Ireland ran the former Great Northern Railway jointly under a Great Northern Railway Board until 1958. Most of the lines in the west of Northern Ireland were closed in the 1960s.\nThe 1955 Modernisation Plan.\nIn 1955, a major modernisation programme costing \u00a31.2\u00a0billion was authorised by the government. The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes occur as steam trains were scrapped 1968, in favour of diesel trains and electric trains. One third of the network was closed by the highly critical Beeching report of the 1960s.\nA major railway survey in April 1961 was used in the writing of a government report on the future of the network. This report was called \"The Reshaping of British Railways\". It was published by the British Railways Board (BRB) in March 1963. A third of all passenger trains would be scrapped and more than 4,000 of the 7,000 stations would be closed.\nInterCity (or, in the earliest days, the hyphenated Inter-City) was introduced by British Rail in 1966 as a brand-name for its long-haul express passenger services (see British Rail brand names for a full history).\nPassenger levels fell steadily from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, but experienced a sharp increase after the introduction of the high-speed Intercity 125 trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nBetween 1934 and 1975 the Northern line ran the Northern City Line as its Highbury Branch. London Underground gave it to British Rail in 1975,\nBefore the sectorization of BR in 1982 the system was split into regions. Working around London, they were London Midland Region (Marylebone, Euston, St Pancras and Broad Street), Southern Region (Waterloo, Victoria, Chairing Cross, Holborn Viaduct, Cannon Street and London Bridge), Western Region (Paddington) and Eastern Region (King's Cross, Moorgate, Broad Street, Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street). This was perceived to be a source of inefficiency, so sectorization made the regions into a single organisation covering all commuter services. At the same time InterCity took over express services and Regional Railways took over regional services. The group was originally called \"Provincial\".\nBR built 2537 steam locomotives from 1948 to 1960, some to pre-nationalisation designs and some to its own, new, standard designs. Eventually BR chose to end the use of steam trains in 1968.\nThe official report known as the \"Modernisation Plan\" of December 1954 was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century. The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety and line capacity, by making the railways more attractive to passengers and freight operators. The important areas were:\nLong-distance trains from Marylebone began to be cut back from 1958 after the line was given from BR Midland Western to the BR Midland Region. Then BR Midland Region thought it was an unnecessary rival of their Midland Main Line. By 1960 there were no daytime trains running to destinations north of Nottingham and only a few still ran at night. Many Express services were cut. By 1963, local stopping services beyond Aylesbury were cut. In 1965 freight services were ended. Between 1963 and 1966 only a few remaining long distance services stayed in use. A large part of the former Great Central Railway was closed as part of the 'Beeching axe'. This meant that Marylebone was now used only by local trains to Aylesbury and High Wycombe. After the 1960s, lack of investment meant the station itself became run down.\nNew diesel trains.\nSome of the early models were of poor quality and design, but many later kinds proved their worth in time.\nBritish Rail Class 127 diesel trains were chosen to operate on the services from Marylebone usually to places such as High Wycombe, Aylesbury and Banbury which are on the Chiltern Main Line and Great Central Main Line (now the London to Aylesbury Line). Strangely, the 115 were under Table 115 in the British Rail timetable. They were similar to British Rail Class 127, but were superior as the class had larger windows, better seats, lights and wall surfaces. Both classes were made in the early 1960s.\nThe British Rail Class 47 (originally \"Brush Type 4\") is a class of British railway diesel-electric locomotive that was developed in the 1960s by Brush Traction. Their reliable and trusted service lasted well in to the 2000s. Some are still working in 2018.\nBritish Rail gave Class 52 to the class of 74 large diesel-hydraulic locomotives built for the Western Region of British Railways between 1961 and 1964. All were given two-word names, with the first word being \"Western\", and so the type was nicknamed \"Westerns\".\nThe British Rail Class 207 (or 3D) versatile diesel-electric multiple units were built by BR at Eastleigh in 1962.\nNew electric trains.\nSome of the early models were of poor quality and design, but many later kinds proved their worth in time.\nThe British Rail Class 423 (or 4Vep) electric multiple units were built by BR at York Works from 1967 to 1974. They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row and mostly found working outer suburban services in South London, and rural services in Kent and Sussex, up to replacement in 2005.\nThe British Rail Class 303 is a type of electric multiple unit. They are also known as \"Blue Train\" units, since they were originally painted blue all over. They were first used in 1960 for the electrification of the North Clyde and the Cathcart Circle lines in Strathclyde.\nThe British Rail Class 73 electro-diesel locomotives are very unusual in that they can operate from a 750 V DC third-rail supply, but also have a diesel engine to allow them to work on non-electrified routes.\nThe British Rail Class 86 was the standard electric locomotive built during the 1960s. It was made after the repeated testing of the earlier classes like the 81 and 85. The tests led to a much improved loco design.\nThe British Rail Class 312 is a type of alternating current (AC) electric multiple unit (EMU) built in 1966\u20131974 intended for use on outer-suburban passenger services. It was the last class of multiple unit to be constructed to the British Rail Mark 2 body shell, and also the last with slam doors. Their passenger seats were an improvement on former types.\nBritish Rail Class 313 electric multiple units were built by BREL at York Works from 1976 to 1977, thus the first second-generation EMUs to be constructed for British Rail. They were capable of both drawing power via 25\u00a0kV\u00a0AC overhead, or 750\u00a0V\u00a0DC third-rail. They were the first units in Britain to have fully automatic couplers which allowed both physical coupling and also the connection of control electric and air supplies to be carried out without the driver's need to leave the cab. Their passenger seats were also an improvement on former types.\nThe Beeching report.\nDuring the late 1950s, railways continued to worsen, and in 1959 the government acted, limiting the amount the British Transport Commission (BTC) could spend on British Rail.\nThe government proposed that many services could be provided more cheaply by buses, and said that most abandoned rail services would have their places taken by bus services. Only main lines would be untouched. Many other minor lines would be cut back or scrapped.\nThe business man Lord Beeching saw South Wales as a failing industrial region. So it lost the majority of its network. Since 1983 it has experienced a major rail revival, with new stations such as Llanharan reopening. Four lines reopened within 20 miles (32\u00a0km) of each other: Abercynon\u2013Aberdare, Barry\u2013Bridgend via , Bridgend\u2013Maesteg and the Ebbw Valley Line via Newbridge.\nThe station at Laurencekirk on the mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen was shut in 1967, but 42 years later in May 2009 it reopened. Other reopened stations include , and \u2013 all closed in the mid-1960s.\nHaddenham in Buckinghamshire lost its little-used station in 1963, but a more popular station opened in 1987 as the town grew.\nA major part of the report proposed that British Rail electrify some major main lines and the use of containerised freight traffic instead of outdated and uneconomic wagon-load traffic. Some of these plans were eventually adopted, however, such as the creation of the Freightliner concept and further electrification of the West Coast Main Line from Crewe to Glasgow in 1974. Also the staffs' terms and conditions were improved over time.\nSince the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, road traffic levels grew heavily in some areas. This has come close to gridlock. Furthermore, in recent years there have been record high levels of passengers on the railways. A modest number of the railway closures have therefore been reversed.\nIn addition a small but significant number of closed stations have reopened, and passenger services been restored on lines where they had been closed or removed. Many of these were in the urban metropolitan counties and towns where Passenger Transport Executives have a role in promoting local passenger rail use.\nA notable reopening was the Robin Hood Line in Nottinghamshire, between Nottingham and Worksop via Mansfield, which reopened in the early 1990s. Before the line reopened, Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a railway station.\nThe Serpell Report.\nProfits from the railways began to fall in the early 1980s. In 1983, the civil servant Sir David Serpell wrote what became known as the Serpell Report. He wanted even more cutbacks.\nIn the early 1980s there was a proposal to close Marylebone and divert British Rail services via High Wycombe into nearby Paddington. There was also a plan to extend the Metropolitan Line to Aylesbury, so London trains via Amersham would be sent to Baker Street. Marylebone station was to be converted into a bus and coach station. London Underground said the Metropolitan Line could not cope with any more trains and was full up. However these plans were deemed stupid and clumsy, and were quietly dropped.\nThe Pacer and Express Sprinter trains.\nThe funding of BR was reduced so they created the cheaper Pacer trains. The British Rail Class 143 is a diesel multiple unit, part of the Pacer family of trains introduced between 1985 and 1986. They originally worked around North East England but were later transferred to Wales. It was made out of bus parts put on to lorry chassis and train wheels. Earlier units proved to be unreliable, but later units were of a better design.\nThe British Rail Class 156 \"Super-Sprinter\" diesel multiple units were built from 1987 to 1989 to replace elderly First Generation \"Heritage\" DMUs (like the Class 127 units) and locomotive-hauled passenger trains.\nAs funding increased before privatisation the successful British Rail Class 158 \"Express Sprinter\" was made. It is a type of diesel multiple unit (DMU) train. They were built for British Rail between 1989 and 1992 by BREL at their Derby Works.\nThe Clapham Junction railway crash.\nOn 12 December 1988, three commuter trains crashed, just south-west of Clapham junction station, in London. 35 people died and more than 100 were injured. British Rail's 30-year-old vintage Mark 1 carriages were found out to be dangerous and the broken signalling equipment was fixed and improved.\nPrivatisation.\nThe British government under John Major said that privatisation would help passenger services, but this did not happen until much later.\nThe Scottish Assembly Government have re-opened the lines between Hamilton and Larkhall, Alloa and Stirling and is working on a link from Airdrie to Bathgate. The biggest line-reopening project is the former Waverley railway Edinburgh to Borders line.\nThe Welsh Assembly Government has re-opened the Vale of Glamorgan Line between Barry Bock and Bridgend in 2005. The Ebbw Valley Line reopened between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff in the year 2008. It will later go on to services to Newport in Gwent in 2011. The Barry\u2013Bridgend route was closed after the Beeching report of March 1963. The line's passenger service was officially shut down in June 1964, but freight continued until the late 1990s.\nSome English stations like Corby and Mansfield were reopened after privatisation.\nYet more stations were reopened by British Rail in Scotland, England and Wales before privatisation when the railway was run properly.\nTrain fares cost more than under British Rail.\nThe split up for privatisation.\nRegional Railways was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail. It was created in the year 1982. It finished operation in 1996, two years after privatisation. In the privatisation of British Rail, InterCity trains were divided up into several franchises. The Caledonian Sleeper are transferred to ScotRail, now First ScotRail.\nSince privatisation, the number of companies has changed a number of times as rules have changed and the areas covered altered. The companies that took over passenger rail services include:\n\"Six sub-brands also occurred in the early 2000s:\"\nThe company logo.\nThe British Rail \"double arrow\" logo was said to show direction of travel on a double track railway on a railway map and was nicknamed \"the arrow of indecision\". It is now employed as a general symbol on street signs in Great Britain, but not in Northern Ireland, denoting railway stations, and as part of the Association of Train Operating Companies (A.T.O.C.)'s joint-managed National Rail brand, still being printed on railway tickets.\nLabour relations.\nSometimes strikes happened among British Rail staff, over staff pay, safety, working hours and alike. There were several strikes in the late 1970s, but decreased after privatisation. There were also several other strikes in the late 1970s. Other firms like the UK's coal mines also struck at this time."}

{"id": "135563", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=135563", "title": "Abnormal psychology", "text": "Abnormal psychology is a part of psychology. People who study abnormal psychology are psychologists. They are scientists that investigate the mind using the scientific method. Different cultures tend to have different ideas of how strange (abnormal) any behaviour is considered. This tends to change over time within cultures, so people that live in a country at one time in history might consider abnormal what people who live in the same country consider normal years before or years later.\nAbnormal psychology is often used to understand or to treat people with mental disorders to make life better for them. This is because abnormal behaviour is often defined as when someone is not able to change how they behave to fit different settings. This is often also used to define some mental disorders. When someone cannot change their behaviour to fit the people and situations around them when they need to, it can cause suffering, and the person may be uncomfortable when around people. Their behaviour can be unreasonable and hard to understand. Their behaviour can even be dangerous.\nNot everyone with a mental disorder is unable to adjust to their surroundings. People who can change to fit their the environment around them more easily than most people can also have behaviour that is considered abnormal and might also have an easier life with the help of a psychologist.\nHistory.\nSupernatural traditions.\nA supernatural belief is a belief in a force that is beyond scientific understanding. There are a lot of cultures that believe in supernatural events. These cultures include religious cultures, as well as the Ancient Chinese, Ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and Ancient Greeks. These cultures have writings that say abnormal behaviour in the form of supernatural events created demons or Gods that would take over a person and act through those people. This was called possession. In the Roman Catholic Church, exorcisms were done to make these demons leave the body of the individuals they possessed. Exorcism involved prayer, noises and potions.p.\u00a011 People who had abnormal behaviour were often told they were possessed.\nIn some cultures, trepanation was often used. This was when a hole was made in someone's head to release the \"bad spirit\".\nAsylums.\n\"Lunatic asylums\" were buildings that kept patients that had abnormal behaviour. They became popular in Europe with the Madhouse Act of 1774, although they did exist before the Act. Asylums were meant to look after people who could not take care of themselves. But they were known for being cruel and abusive to their patients. The buildings were often dirty and not looked after very well.\nDuring the late 1700s, William Tuke made a religious retreat for patients. This was a turn away from the horrors of mental asylums.p.\u00a014 Also, in the late 1700s, Philippe Pinel started to encourage better treatment of the mentally insane.\nToday the 18th-century lunatic asylum does not exist. Most of the asylums were closed in the late 1900s because of the invention of antipsychotic medicines. Today, there are psychiatric hospitals for people with mental illness. This includes Broadmoor Hospital, which houses some of Britain's the most dangerous criminals with mental illnesses.\nAsylums in America.\nIn the 1800s, Dorothea Dix fought against the bad treatment of patients in mental asylums. She started a \"mental hygiene\" group to encourage politicians to change the treatment of mental patients in the United States. When people became aware of the wrongdoing in mental asylums, money was raised to improve the treatment of patients and the asylums. Dix is thought to have helped to create 32 mental hospitals. By 1940 there were more than 400,000 patients living in mental asylums.\nMost treatments were still cruel to patients and were not effective. The asylums were quickly becoming overcrowded. Mary Jane Ward wrote a book in 1946 called \"The Snake Pit\" that raised awareness of the inhumane treatment of mental patients.\nThe National Institute of Mental Health was created the same year. The organisation provided training and support for mental patients and workers that cared for them. The Hill-Burton Act was passed to give money to the mental health hospitals.\nLater, the Community Health Services Act of 1963 was passed. This law which created outpatient buildings for patients to live at home rather than in hospitals. Rehabilitation and community care centers were also built under this act.p.\u00a014\nDeinstitutionalisation.\nDuring the late 1900s, mental asylums were less accepted. The cruel treatment of patients and the overcrowding and ways of living were seen as not needed. Less money was being given to asylums. So many closed all around the world. The closing down of mental hospitals became known as deinstitutionalization. The movement from asylum to community was meant to help patients' development and recovery. The lack of good support programs meant that patients felt abandoned and found it hard to fit into normal life. This led to many becoming homeless.p.\u00a016\nExplaining abnormal behaviour.\nIn the past there were three ways to explain abnormal behaviour. These were supernatural, biological, and psychological explanations. Western medicine no longer uses supernatural explanations. Instead we use biological and psychological explanations. Biological explanations use genetics and neuroscience to explain abnormal behaviours. The biological explanation is based on how the brain works and how genes change the way it works. Psychological explanations use how the mind works to explain abnormal behaviours.\nSupernatural explanations.\nEarly cultures believed that abnormal behaviour was from demons, spirits and astrology. Trepanation was when a hole was drilled in a person's head. This was done to let the spirits or demons out of the person's head.\nExorcism was practiced mainly by the Catholic Church. Exorcism was believed to ward the spirits out of the person that they possessed.\nThese practices were normal during the Middle Ages. This was when abnormal behaviour was thought to be a religious issue rather than a psychological one. Some abnormal behaviour was thought to be witchcraft. People accused of witchcraft were almost always punished for the acts. In many cases, the punishment was to be murdered.\nBiological explanations.\nThe Biological approach to explaining abnormal behaviour assumes that the behaviour can be explained by physical factors. Hippocrates was a man who lived during the 5th century and is thought by many to be the father of modern medicine. He did not accept that evil spirits or astronomy were the causes of psychological disorders. Hippocrates believed that there were natural causes for the disorders and appropriate treatments could be found. He focused on the \"four humors\" of the brain. He believed that the four humours must be balanced for healthy mental states and when one humour was stronger, various disorders would appear. To balance the humors, Hippocrates would tell patients to change their lifestyles.p.\u00a011 There are now new ideas when talking about the biological explanations of psychological disorders. But, Hippocrates' focus on mental processes and clinical practice was a revolutionary concept.\nAnother Greek physician called Galen also took a scientific approach to the causes of psychological disorders. He divided them into physical and mental categories. Among Galen's causes were head injuries, alcohol abuse, and life experiences. During the 18th century, Galen's concepts influenced the medical industry. Galen's focus was on the biological causes for mental disorders.p.\u00a013\nPsychological explanations.\nPsychological explanations for abnormal behavior sometimes take a behavioral approach in which the positive behaviors are reinforced and negative ones are not. This approach is more focused on changing the actual behavior of a person than the true cause of it.\nSigmund Freud was one of the most popular psychological theorists of the 20th century. The method he used to study and treat patients was known as psychoanalysis. Methods of hypnosis by were used by Freud, but also by Franz Mesmer and physicians in the Nancy School. However, Freud attempted to have his patients confess their deepest, truest emotions, which was referred to as a catharsis. He would have his patients speak freely about themselves, in free association. Also he would conduct dream analysis where patients would record and discuss their dreams. Freud's work led to other great psychoanalytic theorists such as Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Harry Stack Sullivan. Wilhelm Wundt and William James were credited for opening up the first experimental psychology laboratories. This led to many studies and psychological methods, such as classical conditioning led by Ivan Pavlov and John B. Skinner, while Edward Thorndike and B. F. Skinner were the leaders of the study of operant conditioning.p.\u00a018\nClassification.\nDSM.\nThe North American reference book used by psychiatrists and psychologists to diagnose and treat psychological disorders is known as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). It is produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The most recent version was released in May of 2013 and is known as the DSM-5. The DSM is relied upon by clinicians, health insurance companies, medicine companies, and the legal system as a reference for understanding and identifying mental disorders. The DSM divides mental disorders into groups and provides descriptive signs and symptoms that define each disorder. In addition, it lists statistics for each disorder ranging from its frequency in the general population to the most effective form of treatment.\nBefore diagnosing an individual with a \"specific\" mental disorder, a professional must first determine whether that individual does in fact suffer from a mental disorder. The DSM defines a mental disorder as a condition that:\nWhen using the DSM, a complete psychiatric diagnosis is split up into five dimensions, called \"axes\", that relate to different characteristics of disability or disorder:\nThe separate axes of the DSM are often linked together in the development of mental disorders.\nICD-10.\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) was created by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is the universal diagnostic system for mental disorders. The ICD is approved by health officials from 193 WHO member countries, and is available for free on the internet. Its purpose is to help countries reduce the problems associated with mental disorders. The coding system used in the DSM is designed to be compatible with the system used in the ICD; however, some codes may not match because the two publications get revised at different times. The ICD-10 was made public in 1994; its most recent update occurred in 2010. Chapter 5 of the ICD-10 covers over 300 mental and behavioral disorders which are divided into the following categories:\n\"The Online ICD-10 can be found in its entirety here\"\nTreatment.\nPsychoanalysis.\nPsychoanalysis is a form of therapy based on psychoanalytic theory. This theory states that human behavior is controlled by unconscious forces such as instinct and that there is no such thing as free will. Many ideas found in the Psychoanalytic theory can be traced back to the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud. Freud believed mental disorders are a result of repressed memories and emotions from childhood; psychoanalysis is designed to search for these hidden memories and emotions and bring them to the patient's attention. Techniques such as hypnosis are used to tap into the unconscious mind with the hopes that the source of the disturbance is found. Freud also believed dreams had hidden meanings, and often asked patients to record their dreams for analysis. Because of the lack of scientific evidence supporting most Freudian ideas, psychoanalysis is rarely used by clinical psychologists and has been replaced by more effective forms of therapy.\nBehavioral therapy.\nBehavior therapy is based on the theory of behaviorism, which states that all human behavior is a result of a stimulus and reinforcement. Famous behaviorists include James Watson, B.F. Skinner, and Joseph Wolpe. The goal of this therapy is to increase one's positive or socially reinforcing behavior. Behavior therapy can be broken down into three areas:\nHumanistic therapy.\nHumanistic therapy is a method taken from Carl Rogers, which aims to focus on a client as a human rather than the problem that they have. A therapist can adjust the environment and mood of a session in a way that mimics normal conversation. This often helps the patient realize the issues they have, and share them with the therapist more successfully than in a traditional counseling session. Humanistic therapy creates an effective means of getting to the source of a problem and treating it properly.\nRoger's own term was \"client-centered therapy\", which has the idea that the therapist is helping the client to become a genuine psychological adult."}

Watson", "text": "John Broadus Watson (January 9, 1878\u2013September 25, 1958) was an American psychologist. He established the psychological school of behaviorism, after doing research on animal behavior. This school was extremely influential in the middle of the 20th century, when B.F. Skinner developed it further.\nWatson was forced to resign his chair at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, because his affair with a graduate student became a public scandal. After this, Watson worked for many years for J. Walter Thompson, a leading American advertising agency. He is credited with popularizing the \"coffee break\" during an ad campaign for Maxwell House coffee.\nBehaviorism.\nWatson founded behaviorism in the spring of 1913 with his paper \"Psychology as the behaviorist views it\". In this article, Watson outlined the major features of his new philosophy of psychology, called \"behaviorism\". The first paragraph of the article concisely described his position:\nPsychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist's total scheme of investigation.\nIn 1913, Watson viewed Ivan Pavlov's conditioned reflex as primarily a physiological mechanism controlling glandular secretions. He had already rejected Edward Thorndike's \"Law of Effect\" (a precursor to B.F. Skinner's principle of reinforcement) because of what Watson believed were 'unnecessary subjective elements'. The article is also notable for its strong defense of the objective scientific status of applied psychology, which at the time was considered to be much inferior to the established experimental psychology.\nWith his behaviorism, Watson put the emphasis on external behavior of people and their reactions on given situations, rather than the internal, mental state of those people. In his opinion, the analysis of behaviors and reactions was the only objective method to get insight in the human actions. This outlook was thought to be extreme or radical behaviorism.\nViews on child-rearing.\nWatson wrote the book \"Psychological care of infant and child\" in 1928, with help from his mistress, turned wife, Rosalie Rayner. Rosalie later entitled a self-penned article \"I am a mother of behaviorist sons\". In the book, Watson explained that behaviorists were starting to believe psychological care and analysis was required for infants and children.\nHis slogan was \"not more babies but better brought up babies\". Watson argued for the nurture side of the nature-nurture debate, claiming that the world would benefit from extinguishing pregnancies for twenty years while enough data was gathered to ensure an efficient child-rearing process. Watsons\u2019 description of a \"happy child\" was rather detached. It included ideas such as that the child can occupy himself through his problem-solving abilities, should only cry when in physical pain, and that the child stray from asking questions. Behavior analysis of child development as a field may have begun with the writings of Watson.\nWatson carried out controversial science experiments known as the \"Little Albert experiments\"; in these experiments, Watson studied fear in infants.\nBiographies of Watson and analysis of his work.\nWatson's views and life have been the subject of a number of works."}

Pavlov is widely known for first describing classical conditioning.\nEarly life and education.\nThe son of a priest, and a theology student, Pavlov turned to science after being influenced by progressive ideas. He took natural sciences at the University of St Petersburg, and got a doctorate in 1878.\nWorks.\nIn the 1890s, Pavlov was investigating the gastric function of dogs by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect, measure, and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions. He noticed that the dogs tended to salivate before food was actually delivered to their mouths, and set out to investigate this \"psychic secretion\", as he called it. Pavlov performed and directed experiments on digestion, eventually publishing \"The work of the digestive glands\" in 1897, after 12 years of research. His experiments earned him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.\nLegacy.\nThe concept for which Pavlov is famous is the \"conditioned reflex\" he developed with his assistant Ivan Tolochinov in 1901.\nAs Pavlov's work became known in the West, particularly through the writings of John B. Watson, the idea of \"conditioning\" as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of comparative psychology, and the general approach to psychology called behaviourism.\nThe British philosopher Bertrand Russell was an enthusiastic advocate of the importance of Pavlov's work for philosophy of mind.\nPavlov's research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science, but also popular culture. The phrase \"Pavlov's dog\" is often used to describe someone who merely reacts to a situation rather than using critical thinking. Pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, \"Brave New World\", and also to a large degree in Thomas Pynchon's \"Gravity's Rainbow\".\nIt is popularly believed that Pavlov always signalled the food by ringing a bell. However, his writings also record the use of many stimuli, including electric shocks, whistles, metronomes, tuning forks, and a range of visual stimuli. Catania did not believe Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his famous experiments. Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlov\u2019s contemporaries Vladimir Bekhterev and John B. Watson, until Thomas found several references that clearly said Pavlov did, indeed, use a bell.\nIt is less widely known that Pavlov's experiments on the conditional reflex included children, some of whom apparently underwent surgical procedures, similar to the dogs, for the collection of saliva."}

In contrast, Przewalski's horse has never been successfully domesticated, and remains a truly wild animal today.\nPrzewalski's horse is one of three known subspecies of \"Equus ferus\", the others being the domesticated horse, \"Equus ferus caballus\" and the extinct tarpan, \"Equus ferus ferus\". Przewalski's horse is the only remaining truly wild \"horse\" in the world. There are still a number of other wild equines, including three species of zebra and various subspecies of the African wild ass, onager (including the Mongolian wild ass) and kiang.\nRelation to domestic horse.\nAlthough Przewalski's horse can hybridize with domestic horses to produce fertile offspring, it has an extra pair of chromosomes.\nIn zoos.\nAccording to ISIS, about 480 Przewalski's were reported in captivity."}

She has an older sister, Angela, and a younger brother, David, who is also a musician. Perry has said that her upbringing was \"sheltered\" and that an example of this was that her family did not eat Lucky Charms cereal because her parents thought that luck was something that came from the devil. She also called deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\" growing up.\n2001: \"Katy Hudson\".\nThen known as Katy Hudson, she released a Christian album named after herself. It had the single \"Search Me\". She was discovered by Glen Ballard, who is known for his work with musician Alanis Morissette. This album did not perform well, and she was dropped from her record label, Red Hill, when the label was shut down. She struggled for six years before eventually signing with her current label, Capitol Records.\n2007\u201309: \"One of the Boys\".\nAfter changing her last name to Perry (her mother's maiden name) so that she allegedly would not be confused with actress Kate Hudson, Katy released an EP album called \"Ur So Gay\".

Perry says it is \"about the magical beauty of a woman.\" On June 26, 2008, the song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, becoming the 1000th chart-topper of the Rock Era. The song has since become a major worldwide hit, and along with the United States it has topped the charts in more than 20 countries, including Canada, Sweden, Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and Ireland.\nMusic video.\nA music video for the song was released on May 16, 2008, on Perry's personal website and on MySpace. The video was directed by Kinga Burza and features a Moulin Rouge and burlesque-type setting with scenes containing Katy, along with many other flamboyantly-dressed women, dancing to the song. Eventually she wakes up next to a male companion, Katy's real life boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes band member Travis McCoy. Despite the song's title, there is not any depiction of same-sex kissing. Katy features her real life friend and DJ, Mia Moretti and her main gay, Markus Molinari's dog Bella in the video. Even her cat, Kitty Purry, makes an appearance. \nThe video made its television debut on June 12 on TRL with the visit and interview by Perry in set show. And on June 24, 2008 it became #1 on TRL. The video obtained high airplay on this music video channel, as well as on VH1. It debuted at #20 on VH1's VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown on June 28, 2008. On June 30, 2008 the video was premiered on MTV Latin America. On July 6, 2008, it rose to #4 on VH1's VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. The video received five nominations for the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video and Best New Artist. The video has had over 24 million views on YouTube. Due to the video and the songs popularity around the world, there are several videos on YouTube which imitate and mock the song such as \"I Kissed a Pig\" and \"I Kissed a Dog\", both of which use the same tune and similar lyrics, while the videos use similar scenes to the original.\nCritical reception.\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" has drawn mixed reviews from critics. \"Blogcritics Magazine\" called it \"an instantly catchy number,\" and About.com said, \"fueled by an instrumental wallop provided courtesy of producer Dr. Luke, 'I Kissed a Girl' is the perfect breakthrough.\"\nHowever, Rolling Stone, while giving her album 2/5 stars, despite describing the song as a \"New Wave-y club single,\" says the supposedly rebellious \"attention-grabbing\" lyrics are \"a vanilla recounting of her chick-on-chick exploits\" and that this \"acting out\" is \"just to get a dude's attention.\" AllMusic praises \"the stomping Gary Glitter beat\" before criticizing the producers for turning it \"into a leaden stumble and burying Perry's voice underneath Pro Tools overdubs so it all winds up as a faceless wash of sound designed to be placed in TV shows, movie trailers, and malls.\"\nSal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote, Perry's \"lead single 'I Kissed a Girl' features a throbbing beat and an infectious, bi-curious hook, but its self-satisfied, in-your-face posturing rings phony in comparison to the expertly constructed ambiguities of 'Justify My Love' or practically anything in the first decade of Ani DiFranco's catalogue; it's like a tween version of DiFranco's tortured bisexual confession 'Light of Some Kind.'\" \"Hiponline.com\" wrote that the song is \"not nearly as interesting or exciting as you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s not even half as good as Jill Sobule\u2019s song 'I Kissed a Girl'.\u201d \"Glitterati Gossip\" agrees Sobule's song \"was ten times better, because there was actual emotional content to her lyrics.\"\nPopular reception.\nThe song was premiered on BBC Radio 1 in the UK on July 21, 2008 on The Scott Mills Show. It was praised by many fans on their text lines and was made his record of the week. On July 23, 2008, \"I Kissed a Girl\" was added to the station's C-List, \"The Playlist,\" being, \"where most songs on daytime Radio 1 are selected from\". The song has since made it to the station's more popular A-list. \nPrevious to its debut on Radio 1, it had been (and continues to be) on the playlist of some of the UK radio stations which are part of The One Network for a number of weeks. In addition it had received at least one play a week on BBC Radio 2 on its Saturday evening America\u2019s Greatest Hits show hosted by Paul Gambaccini due to the song\u2019s number status in the Billboard chart.\nControversy.\nThe song gained a significant amount of controversy after its rise in popularity due to its perceived promotion of bisexuality and promiscuity. While community members and parents may be concerned over \"the coarseness of the sexual behavior,\" including its public nature and intoxicated state, they may or, such as Unitarian minister Debra W. Haffner, may not be concerned over \"the sex or gender of the person she's talking about.\"\nWhile Haffner, who holds a degree in public health, believes Perry \"obviously is using the whole issue of sexual orientation in a positive way, raising awareness, or she's doing it because it gets attention,\" AllMusic concludes that, \"the problem is not with Katy's gender-bending, it's that her heart isn't in it; she's just using it to get her places, so she sinks to crass, craven depths.\" \"Slant Magazine\" agrees, saying, the song, \"isn't problematic because it promotes homosexuality, but because its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention\u2014both from Perry's boyfriend and her audience.\"\nAdam Holz of \"PluggedinOnline\", a division of Focus on the Family, wrote an article entitled \"A Tale of Two Katys\" about the singer's image transformation from a Contemporary Christian Music artiste to one of the \"girls gone wild\". He criticizes the song for being the latest, \"high-profile message to young women and men that our sexuality is a malleable commodity that can be reshaped at will.\" Holz also argues that Perry's message carries with it, \"no need to worry about who might get used or objectified in the process,\" causing Katy to live, \"down to a damaging, demeaning stereotype.\"\nIn some areas of the world the song's bi-curious lyrics have kept it from reaching the Top 40 or to even be released at all. Though the \"Toronto Star\", of Canada, describes it as \"a lesbian-friendly tune,\" whether anti-gay bias fuels negative reactions to the song or the song itself appears to divide critics. While \"Slant\" and other critics suggest that Perry may be homophobic, especially given her single \"Ur So Gay\", which makes \"I Kissed a Girl\" seem like \"a classic example of the 'Guys kissing is gross, girls kissing is hot' line of thought\" \"The Star Ledger\" quotes a listener who proposes that negative reactions to the song are due to homophobia, saying that it would not draw disapproval if sung by a male artist, and who compares the level of explicitness in the lyrics with other songs on the radio such as rap lyrics. \"MomLogic.com\" writer Vuv-A-Licious agrees, asking, \"'What's the big deal?'...When this tune is playing and my son and daughter are dancing, I will be trying to dance along, or trying to acknowledge that they may one day dance to the beat of a different drummer than me.\"\nDuring her Washington concert at Warped Tour, Perry actually did kiss a girl from the audience.\nIn an August 2008 interview with the \"Daily Mail\", Perry's mother, Mary Hudson, who is an evangelical Christian preacher, was reported as saying that she disliked the song, stating: \"It clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting...\" However, Perry took to her official blog stating that her mother's supposed comments were completely fabricated, while also saying her parents love and support her and attend many of her shows.\nRegarding the question of her own sexuality that the song has raised, Perry told Santa Barbara magazine (which featured her on the cover), \"I like to kiss boys, but there is no doubt in my mind if Angelina Jolie or Gisele B\u00fcndchen came a callin', who wouldn't pucker up?\"\nChart performance.\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" debuted at number 76 at Billboard Hot 100. After a couple of weeks, the single hit the top 5, due to the rising digital downloads and increasing radio airplay. It continued to rise the next week, reaching #2 just behind her labelmate, Coldplay. The following week, the song reached the summit of the US chart, becoming the 1000th #1 song of the rock era (the 961st #1 on the Billboard Hot 100). In addition the song also gave the Capitol label two consecutive Hot 100 #1's, as the week's prior #1 was fellow Capitol artist Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\", making it the first time since 1976 Capitol has had two back to back chart toppers on the Hot 100. The single also crossed over to Billboard's sister publication R&amp;R's Rhythmic chart in its July 5 issue, where not only did she have the highest debut ever for a non-rhythmic track, entering at number 26 with 1,065 spins, she also had the highest debut from a new artist in over five years. The bow is the best for a debut track at Rhythmic since Beyonc\u00e9 entered at No. 21 with \"Crazy in Love\" in 2003. It also became the first song since Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" to simultaneously appear on the Mainstream Top 40, Rhythmic, Adult Top 40 and Alternative charts. On July 26, 2008, the track also made history by reaching the number one spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart by three weeks, a first for a solo act with a debut single. The song topped the Hot 100 for seven weeks in a row before finally being dethroned by Rihanna's \"Disturbia\". It is the second longest running number one on the Hot 100 of 2008 so far, with only Flo Rida's \"Low\" topping the chart for longer. The single has sold more than 2,500,000 downloads in the United States to date.\nIn Canada, the single debuted at #55 at Canadian Hot 100. On June 12th the song soared to #1, jumping 26 spots from #27 position. Also on the Canadian iTunes Top 100, the song remained at #1 for over 6 weeks, until rapidly being pushed to #4 on August 7, 2008, behind Lady GaGa's \"Just Dance\", the Jonas Brothers' \"A Little Bit Longer\" and Rihanna's \"Disturbia\". \nIn New Zealand, the song debuted at number 38, the single's first appearance in other countries chart outside North America, moving to number three the following week. The song was certified Gold after seven weeks with sales of over 7,500. On August 11, eight weeks after debuting on the chart, \"I Kissed A Girl\" finally made it to number one.\nIn Australia, the song debuted at #11 on the 30th of June on downloads alone, then the next week jumped to second position behind Jordin Sparks, still on downloads alone. The next week it jumped to number one still solely off downloads, becoming only the second single to do so. Ironically, by the time the song went number 1, this was the time when World Youth Day 2008 had started and the event held anti-gay views. On 21st July, 2008, after the singles physical release, the track retained its number one position and was certified Gold. The single has held the number one position since and has gone on to be certified Platinum.\nIn the United Kingdom, a cover version released by the artist Nicki Bliss was climbing up the UK iTunes Chart. It debuted on the UK Singles Chart (published 3 August 2008) at position number 50.\nA second cover version, by Barnicle, entered the UK Singles Chart (published 3 August 2008) at position #116.\nBecause of the success of the cover versions, the official release of Katy Perry's version was brought forward from September 1 to July 30, 2008. On August 3, 2008, the song, which had entered the UK Singles Chart at number 139 the week before, climbed 135 places to reach position number 4. The song has become one of the most requested on Radio 1's request hour. The following week it climbed 3 places to reach number 1. The following week it stayed at the top spot for a second consecutive week and then went on to spend 5 consecutive weeks at #1.\nEven parodies of \"I Kissed a Girl\" are seeing chart success. Robert Lund's spoof \"I Peed in the Pool\" reached #1 on Dr. Demento's August 2008 comedy music countdown. Including the MADtv parody, \"I'll Kiss a Girl\" featuring Nicole Parker as Ellen DeGeneres and fellow cast member Arden Myrin as Portia de Rossi, by Ellen saying that she's been kissing girls since the 9th grade."}

It can also be known just as the peregrine, and was once called the \"Duck hawk\" in North America. In Pakistan it is officially the military iconic symbol of the PAF and the unofficial territory bird of Gilgit-Baltistan.\nThe peregrin is a crow-sized falcon, with a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head and \"moustache\". It can go at up to 322 km/h (200 mph) in a dive, which means it is the fastest animal in the world. As with other bird-eating raptors, the female is bigger than the male. There are 17\u201319 subspecies recorded, and each varies slightly in appearance and where they live. There is disagreement over whether the distinctive Barbary falcon is a subspecies of the Peregrine or just a different species.\nThe use of certain pesticides, especially DDT was not good for the animals. It could be shown that in areas where DDT was used, the thickness of the shells of their eggs was reduced. This caused a dramatic decline in their numbers, in certain countries. Since the use of DDT has been forbidden in many countries, their numbers are increasing again. This recovery was helped because their nesting places were protected in many countries; some countries also bred these falcons in captivity and released them into the wild.\nOther websites.\nConservation organizations:"}

His writings on libertarian municipalism, a theory of face-to-face, grassroots democracy, had an influence on the Green Movement and anti-capitalist direct action groups such as Reclaim the Streets. His criticisms of \"new age\" Greens such as Charlene Spretnak contributed to the divisions in the American Green movement in the 1990s.\nAlthough an anti-capitalist, Murray Bookchin often met with libertarian thinker Murray Rothbard and occasionally attended Libertarian Party (United States) conventions, endorsing their presidential candidate Roger MacBride in 1976.\nBookchin has influenced the thinking of captured Kurdish militant Abdullah \u00d6calan, who has renounced violence and now wants a peaceful solution to the question of Kurdish autonomy.\nLibertarian municipalism.\nBookchin was the first to use the term \"Libertarian municipalism\", to describe a system in which libertarian institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the State with a confederation of free municipalities.

His father was Carbonari in 1821, one of his brothers and a brother-in-law were deputies, while Carlo Cafiero was always called the 'black sheep' of the family. In 1864 he went to Naples, where he got a degree in law. He then went to Florence and at the beginning of 1870 he was in Paris. The Paris he went to London, where he matured, renouncing his diplomatic career, his wealth and family, to join the revolution and socialism. In London Cafiero made contacts with Marx and Engels. He joined the International Workingmen's Association and was charged to go back to Italy and conquer it to Marx\u2019s ideology, where instead there was the strong influence of the Anarchism of Mikhail Bakunin and the Republicanism of Giuseppe Mazzini. He restored the ancient section of 'L'Internazionale' in Naples, with the help of the young Errico Malatesta. There, during an assembly, he was imprisoned for the first time.\nCafiero became an anarchist.\nAfter over a year spent in Italy as a representative of Marx and Engels Cafiero felt the influence of anarchism. And thanks to the friendship with Giuseppe Fanelli, he passed on to the other side of the barricade, with Bakunin and his Italian followers. In early 1872 came the first issue of the newspaper \"La Campana\" and Cafiero wrote for, and gave money towards the publication. In the same year he met Bakunin in Locarno (Switzerland). In the summer of 1873, with the help of Cafiero, an old project was realised: to create an international center for the revolution in Italy and the world. Cafiero, selling all his inherited lands, bought a farm in Switzerland where Bakunin could live. This center was called \"La Baronata\", would also be a safe shelter for revolutionaries persecuted by their respective governments. In 1875 Cafiero went to Milan and joined the editorial staff of the first socialist daily paper, \"La Plebe\", directed by Enrico Bignami. In April 1877, Cafiero, Malatesta, Ceccarelli, the Russian Stepniak and 30 other comrades began an insurrection in the province of Benevento. They took the village of Letino without violence and with great enthusiasm. Arms and food were expropriated and distributed amongst the people, tax money was returned and official documents destroyed. Cafiero, in dialect, explained about anarchism, freedom, justice and the new society without the State, without masters, servants, soldiers and owners. His proclamations convinced even the parish priest who called the rebel group 'the true apostles sent by the Lord'. The following day the village of Gallo was taken in a similar fashion. As they were leaving Gallo the Internationalists were surprised and surrounded by government troops and all were arrested. Held in prison for over a year before being brought to trial all the accused were eventually acquitted in August 1878. In 1878, Cafiero was living in Marseilles working as cook and docker. In October he was arrested with Malatesta, then released and expelled from France. He rested in Switzerland, meeting with Kropotkin, and with the collaboration of \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus promoted the publications of Bakunin. In 1881 Cafiero went to London, where he remained for a long time. In March 1882 he returned to Italy, expressing the will to take part in the imminent electoral campaign.\nThe exile and the rest of life.\nOn April 5th he was arrested without any charge but on May 2nd, while imprisoned, he was the victim of a strong mental crisis and attempted to kill himself. The scandal of a man imprisoned without reason and crazy exploded and Cafiero was released with only the choice between forced residence in Barletta, his birth town, or exile to Switzerland. Cafiero chose the exile in the small town of Chiasso. Emilio Bellerio took Cafiero to his house in Locarno and Errico Malatesta wrote about him \"if his mind is ill, his heart is still healthy...\". In February 1883 Cafiero left for Florence, but was found in a street very shocked, so some doctors transferred him to a lunatic asylum in the city. After the lunatic asylum for the rest of his life had problems, Olimpia Kutusoff, mate of Cafiero, returned from Russia in September 1883 to assist him in the asylum of Imola. Olimpia left him after one and a half years because Cafiero in his crises was violent with her. Carlo expressed the will to return in Barletta where he arrived in the second half of \u201989. However his brothers turned him away and after living some time in a hotel he was taken in by his brother Pietrantonio. In 1891, following another crisis, Carlo Cafiero was confined in the asylum of Nocera Inferiore where he died on Sunday July 17, 1892."}

He helped make the Austrian School of economics popular in the United States.\nRothbard helped to create modern libertarianism, a political belief in less government and more personal freedom. He founded a form of free-market anarchism which he called \"anarcho-capitalism\". Rothbard believed society should organise itself, and he didn't like central planning.\nRothbard wrote over twenty books and was an important central figure in the American libertarian movement.\nHis ideas.\nRothbard advocated the abolition of government control of society and the economy. He considered the monopoly force of government the greatest danger to liberty and the long-term well-being of the people. He called the state a \"gang of thieves writ large \u2014 the most immoral, grasping and unscrupulous individuals in any society\".\nRothbard thought that all services provided by monopoly governments could be provided more efficiently by the private sector. According to him, many regulations and laws passed \"for the public interest\" were self-interested power grabs by scheming government bureaucrats to make themselves look important. These schemes were not subject to market disciplines.\nGovernment services were not efficient, and would get eliminated, if the services could be provided by competition in the private sector.\nRothbard was equally condemning of big business working with government. Business elites, he thought, used government's monopoly power so as to influence laws and regulatory policy to help themselves at the expense of their competitive rivals.\nHe argued that taxation was theft on a grand scale, backed by law. It was \"a compulsory monopoly of force\" which prevented the more efficient voluntary procurement of defense and judicial services from competing suppliers. He also argued against central banking and fractional reserve banking. A monopoly system where the government decides how much money to print is, to him, a form of state-sponsored, legalized financial fraud. It is against libertarian principles and ethics. Rothbard opposed military, political, and economic interferences in the affairs of other nations."}

Tresca was famous for the fight and the opposition to the fascism, stalinism, and the mafia. Tresca was part of the defense committee for accused murderers Sacco and Vanzetti, and frequently spoke in their defense at rallies and in articles. During the 1930s, Tresca became an outspoken opponent of Soviet Communists and Stalinism, particularly after the Soviet Union had engineered the destruction of the anarchist movement in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish Revolution. Before this, Tresca had supported the Bolsheviks, with the excuse of that a Communist state was preferable to a capitalist state. In early 1938 Tresca publicly accused the Soviets of kidnapping Juliet Poyntz to prevent her defection from the Communist Party USA. Tresca said that, before she had disappeared, Poyntz had talked to him about her disgust over Joseph Stalin's Great Terror. In 1941 Tresca, in a revealing moment, admitted to Max Eastman that Nicola Sacco was guilty of the crime with which he was charged, though Vanzetti was innocent. In New York, Tresca also began a public campaign of criticism of the Mafia in his weekly newspaper, \"Il Martello\". Tresca was killed probably by the mafia, with a gun shot. Others have thought that Tresca was eliminated by the NKVD because of the criticism of the Stalin regime of the Soviet Union. "}

The salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter drugs either as single-ingredient preparations, or more commonly in combination with antihistamines, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and/or ibuprofen. Sudafed is a trademark for a common brand which contains pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, though Sudafed PE does not. Drugs containing pseudoephedrine are commonly used as a treatment for Rhinitis (an inflammation of the mucous mebranes in the nose)\nUnlike antihistamines, which modify the systemic histamine-mediated allergic response, pseudoephedrine only relieves nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies.\nThe advantage of oral pseudoephedrine over topical nasal preparations, such as oxymetazoline, is that it does not cause rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa); however, it is more likely to cause adverse effects, including high blood pressure.\nSome countries started to replace pseudoephedrine by other drugs, such as phenylephrine. The reason for this is that pseudoephedrine can be used to make methamphetamine, which is an illegal drug."}

Sometimes autopsies are done to train new doctors.\nSometimes, the cause of death can be found by simply looking at the corpse without opening it. In other cases, it may need to be opened, to find the cause of death. If it is opened, it is usually closed again; most of the time, corpses are buried. Before being buried, they are on display for some time. For this, they need to look acceptable. In certain cases, like when the corpse is opened, special permissions are perhaps necessary.

David Hand was the head director (he was in charge of other directors). Walt Disney made the movie. It is based on the book \"Bambi, A Life in the Woods\" by Felix Salten. RKO Radio Pictures sent the movie to theatres on August 13, 1942. It is the fifth movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story is about a baby deer named Bambi. He learns to grow up in the wild after hunters shoot his mother. The main characters are Bambi (a mule deer) his parents (the Great Prince of the forest and his mother), and his friends: Thumper (a rabbit), Flower (a skunk), and Faline (who becomes his wife later).\nFor the movie, Disney changed Bambi to a mule deer. In the book, Bambi was a Roe Deer. However, roe deer do not live in the United States, and Americans know more about mule deer. The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound (Sam Slyfield), Best Song (for \"Love Is a Song\" sung by Donald Novis) and Original Music Score. In June 2008, the American Film Institute wrote a list of its \"Top 10\"\u2014the best ten movies\u2014after asking over 1,500 people. \"Bambi\" came in third in animation. In December 2011, the movie was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.\nThe story.\nA little fawn called Bambi is born in the woods. In his first days of life, he explores the forest around him. He makes a friend named Thumper. Thumper is a rabbit. Bambi learns new words every day. \"Bird\" is his first word. He learns \"butterflies\", \"rain\", and \"meadow\". He sees his father (the Great Prince of the Forest) for the first time. The movie first shows Bambi's childhood, such as a walk in the woods, a day in the meadow, and his first experience seeing snow.\nThe most famous part of the movie is the death of Bambi's mother. Bambi and his mother have trouble finding food. One day, Bambi's mother finds a patch of grass, and they eat. The audience hears scary music (Man's theme). Bambi's mother knows there is danger. She tells Bambi to run. As they run across an icy field, she screams \"Faster! Faster, Bambi! Don't look back! Keep running! Keep running!\". Bambi runs away, but there is a gunshot. Bambi gets back to the den but finds that his mother is not there. He walks around, and desperately calls for her. He meets his father, the Great Prince, who tells him that \"your mother can't be with you anymore\". Bambi follows his father into the woods, taking one last look behind him.\nThe next spring, Bambi and his friends are young adults. They meet a wise old owl, called Friend Owl. The owl tells them of the dangers of falling in love. They make vows not to fall in love. However, they fall in love at first sight very soon. Bambi falls in love with his old childhood friend Faline. He happily dances in the clouds until another deer gets in the way. He tries to get Faline to go with him, but Bambi does not want to. He gets into a fight with this deer. Bambi wins. He goes on a date with Faline. The Man comes back and makes more trouble for the animals. Bambi saves Faline from some angry dogs.\nA forest fire comes and nearly destroys everything. Bambi has trouble getting up, but his father helps him. They both make it to an island where the animals have got together. The next spring, everyone goes to see Bambi and Faline's new fawns (baby deer). The wise owl says that Bambi should be proud. The Great Prince steps down from his current place as king, and Bambi is left standing proudly. A chorus sings the song from the beginning, \"Love is a Song.\"\nProduction.\nWalt Disney wanted to have realistic detail in this animated movie. The artists learned from animal experts. They also visited the Los Angeles Zoo. A pair of fawns (named Bambi and Faline) were shipped from the area of present-day Baxter State Park in Maine to the studio so that the artists could see for themselves how these animals move. The source of these fawns, from the Eastern United States, gave the company the idea to change Felix Salten's Roe Deer to a mule deer. The background of the movie was also the Eastern woodlands. One of the earliest and best known artists for the Disney studio, Maurice \"Jake\" Day, spent a lot of weeks in the Vermont and Maine forests. He drew pictures and took photographs of deer, fawns, and the wilderness areas around them.\nRelease.\n\"Bambi\" was released in theaters in 1942, during World War II. It was Disney's 5th full-length animated movie. \"Bambi\" was released again to theatres in 1947, 1957, 1966, 1975, 1982, and 1988. It was then made available on home video in 1989. Even in home video, \"Bambi\" has seen many releases, including two VHS releases, in 1989 (Classics Version) and 1997 (Masterpiece Collection Version), and a digitally-remastered and restored Platinum Edition DVD. The Platinum Edition DVD went on moratorium on January 31, 2007.\nBambi was released in Diamond Edition on March 1, 2011, consisting of a Blu-ray and DVD combo pack. According to Cinema Blend, this release is set to include multiple bonus features that were not previously included in Bambi home releases: a documentary entitled \"Inside Walt\u2019s Story Meetings\u00a0\u2013 Enhanced Edition\", two deleted scenes, a deleted song, an image gallery, and a game entitled \"Disney\u2019s Big Book of Knowledge: Bambi Edition\". The release also marked the first use of \"Disney Second Screen\", a feature which is accessed via a computer or iPad app download that syncs with the Blu-ray disc, allowing the viewer to follow along by interacting with animated flip-books, galleries and trivia while watching the movie. A UK version of Diamond Edition was released on February 7, 2011.\nMidquel.\n\"Bambi II\" is a story which takes place after Bambi's mother dies, but before Bambi becomes an adult. It shows the Great Prince of the Forest having trouble raising Bambi, and Bambi not being sure if his father really loves him. The movie was released direct-to-video on February 7, 2006. While the movie was a direct-to-video release in the United States and other countries, including Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, it was a theatrical release in some countries, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Dominican Republic, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom and some other European countries."}

The colors are red (bright vermilion), white (silver), and blue (cobalt blue). The first Stadtholder, or ruler, of the Dutch Republic was William of Orange, who joined with Dutch nationalists and led the struggle for independence from Spain. Partly out of respect for him, the first flag adopted by the Dutch was originally orange, white, and blue. The orange dye was particularly unstable and tended to turn red after a while, so in the mid-17th century, red was made the official color. The flag has flown since then. As the first revolutionary flag, it has had an influence throughout the world. Until about 1800, in the case of both the orange- and the red-striped versions, the number of stripes and their order frequently varied."}

The song was released on December 1, 2008. The music video for the single was directed by P. R. Brown and Shawn Crahan.\nMusic video.\nThe music video for \"Dead Memories\" was directed by P. R. Brown. On September 30, 2008, the band's record label \"Roadrunner Records\" released a 15 second teaser video on YouTube which showed vocalist Corey Taylor in what looks like to be a grave in heavy rainfall. The video came out on MTV's \"Headbangers Ball\" on October 25, 2008 as part of the \"Headbangers Ball\" 20th anniversary special programming. The concept of the music video was percussionist Shawn Crahan's idea. Crahan calls the music video a \"short film\" and said that it was a \"very\" expensive video to make. Crahan's original idea was to have several rooms, he shared his idea with to vocalist Corey Taylor who decided what each room would be.\nThe video starts off with Taylor seen without his mask and dressed in casual clothes carrying a shovel and smoking a cigarette. He walks from an urbanized area (in the extended version, he is seen walking through a park, before approaching a car and smashing its headlights) in to a more rural area in the fields and begin to dig at the ground. He then seemingly falls through the ground and into a room below dressed in his Slipknot mask and cover-alls. The first room, which is a dark room with faint red lighting shows turntablist Sid Wilson who is seen barefoot, climbing all over the walls and is covered in dust and cobwebs. Taylor opens the drapes to attempt to look out of the window but can only see dirt. Wilson is then seen physically trying to stop Taylor from leaving the room by grabbing his pant leg. However, Taylor eventually leaves the room and enters a second which is occupied by drummer Joey Jordison, with tree branches instead of fingers and a crown of thorns on his head. The room features many photographs of Jordison on the walls and he is sitting in a chair surrounded by several females. Taylor walks around the scene looking at them without interacting with Jordison or the females, there is a moment in which Jordison is looking in a mirror and Taylor suddenly appears. Taylor then leaves the room and enters a third which is occupied by sampler Craig Jones who is standing straight upright and does not move throughout the scene. When Taylor enters the room the video is solarized and remains so throughout the time Taylor's in there. Taylor walks around Jones and inspects his mask and is seen touching the nails protruding from it. Jones then lights a smoke flare, which blinds Taylor, and is seen holding it in his right hand, but he [Taylor] finds the door then leaves the room and enters a fourth which is occupied by bassist Paul Gray.\nThis room is filled with mirrors, similar to that of a house of mirrors. Taylor is seen walking through the room while Gray seemingly follows him. Taylor then focuses on Gray and makes a waving gesture to seemingly establish if it's a mirror. Gray then gets aggravated, looks up and hits the mirror viciously, and Taylor is seen looking at a broken mirror and a reflection of himself. Taylor after he looks himself in the mirror, screams and looks around anxiously before he falls backwards out Paul Gray's rooms door and lands into a fifth room, which is occupied by percussionist Shawn Crahan. Crahan is seen with several females dancing around him while holding his baseball bat. Taylor is seen returning to his feet and he pushes his way through the crowd. Two of the females are seen trying to physically stop him from leaving the room by grabbing his clothes. Taylor then enters a sixth room which is a thin, blank corridor occupied by guitarist Mick Thomson. The two seemingly stand off, Taylor is seen trying to push past Thomson several times but is knocked backward several times with. Taylor is then seen stood at another door, as if Thomson was simply a mirage. He enters a seventh room which is occupied by guitarist James Root, Root is seen with several females in a room which is classically decorated. Throughout this room the video is reversed. Taylor is seen walking through the crowd almost unnoticed. He then enters an eighth room which is occupied by percussionist Chris Fehn. Fehn is seen lighting candles in the room which has walls covered in art. Taylor is seen observing and gaining interest in his actions while a female is seen walking around the room. Fehn is then seen lighting a candle and gives it to Taylor who blows it out. Taylor is then seen in casual clothes again outside in the rain digging, when a second Taylor rises from the hole dressed in his Slipknot mask and uniform, and the two see each other as it fades to black.\nReception.\nDuring album reviews for \"All Hope Is Gone\", \"Dead Memories\" was given good feedback for its melody and accessibility. Reviewing for Blabbermouth.net, Ryan Ogle says that the single shows Slipknot's diversity, he went on to say that it is \"well-written and melodious\". Dan Martin from \"The Guardian\" compared it to Metallica's song \"Enter Sandman\" and went on to say, \"[it] is so listenable it's almost conventional.\" However, Jim Kaz of IGN said that the song almost detracts from the intensity of the album, stating, \"it's at this point the band loses a little momentum.\" Additionally, Ogle of Blabbermouth.net also said that it's a song that \"lack[s] the white hot fire that allows the rest of the disc to burn our asses.\""}

After being an executive at Ford Motor Company, McNamara served as Defense Secretary from 1961 to 1968, during the Vietnam War under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. After holding that position he served as President of the World Bank from 1968 until 1981. He was of Irish ancestry on his father's side.\nEarly life.\nMcNamara was born in San Francisco into an Irish family. He graduated from high school in 1933. McNamara was an Eagle Scout. He went to the University of California Berkeley where he got a degree in economics. He went to Harvard University for his MBA. After a short time working as an accountant he taught at Harvard. He married his high school sweetheart, Margaret Craig, in 1940. In 1943 he joined the Air Force. During the war, he looked at how effficent bombers were working and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. For his service in World War II, he was given the Legion of Merit.\nBusiness Career at Ford.\nIn 1946 McNamara got together with Charles \"Tex\" Thornton and eight other people who, like Thornton, he knew from the military and went into business. The group was hired by Ford Motor Company, which was going through a difficult time. This group was known as the \"Whiz Kids\". The Whiz Kids made changes to the company that led to it becoming more profitable and its cars getting better reviews and better sales. He rose through the company fast. In 1960 he became the President of Ford. He helped launch several successful models, like the Lincoln Continental and the Ford Falcon and put in some of the first modern safety features to be seen in cars.\nSecretary of Defense.\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president. After he asked Robert A. Lovett to be his Defense Secretary, Lovett said no but recommended McNamara. McNamara was considered for both the Defense and Treasury Secretaries even though he was (and was for his entire life) a member of the Republican Party (Kennedy was a Democrat). He wasn't interested in being Treasury Secretary but eventually decided to be Kennedy's Secretary of Defense.\nMcNamara was known for using statistics to make decisions about the military and to make it more efficient. He tried to cut down on wasteful spending, often by merging programs into more efficient single ones. He also worked to end discrimination based on race and sex in the US Military. While in Kennedy's cabinet, he became good friends with Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General at the time (and brother of the president). McNamara was a big supporter of the space program and was one of the first people in government to suggest going to the moon. He wrote a recommendation to Kennedy in 1961 in support of a moon mission. Kennedy made the moon mission a priority for NASA, and the US went to the moon for the first time in 1969.\nMcNamara ended the \"Massive Retaliation\" policy that came from the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower. Instead, McNamara put in place \"flexible response\" which allowed more options for defending the US. President Kennedy very much wanted to fight communist revolutions and wars to stop Soviet power from spreading, and McNamara supported this. He also played a big role in peacefully ending the Cuban Missile Crisis. He advised Kennedy to blockade Cuba and stop the Soviet Union from putting more missiles there. Kennedy agreed and their strategy worked.\nJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. His successor, Lyndon Johnson, kept McNamara as Defense Secretary. He became a major leader of the Vietnam war, and he and General William Westmoreland were the two biggest leaders in the American military during the war. In order to stop the communists from taking over Vietnam, McNamara sent more troops to the country. Over a number of years this stopped the North Vietnamese Army from winning the war, but as large amounts of American soldiers were killed the war became very unpopular with the people. He and the president strongly disagreed on troop levels - McNamara wanted to stop the increase in troops but Johnson wanted to send more over. McNamara resigned from the Defense Department in 1968. Johnson did not run for reelection that year and the election was won by Richard Nixon, who ran on a promise to end the war. Nixon signed a peace treaty in 1973, but the North Vietnamese would eventually win the war after the US pulled out.\nResponsibility for the way the US fought the war.\nMcNamara shifted control of the war from commanders in the field to management experts in Washington. He did this by collecting data of different kinds, but also by appointing General Westmoreland as commander of the forces in Vietnam. \nFor McNamara's \"manager\" in Vietnam, General Westmoreland, the key numbers were the \"cross-over point\"... when NVA/VC losses in South Vietnam... would be greater than the NVA's ability to replace those losses\".\nAs we now know, the US forces were gradually getting on top, when a mixup in intelligence failed to warn them of a big NVA offensive. The famous surprise Tet Offensive of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) was reported by the press in the US as a serious defeat for the US, when in fact it was a considerable success: the NVA had suffered huge casualties. \nLater career.\nAfter leaving the Defense Department, McNamara received the Medal of Freedom, published a book, and was hired as President of the World Bank. In 1972 he was in the news when a man saw him on a ferry boat in Massachusetts and tried to throw him in the ocean. McNamara told police not to press charges. While at the World Bank he focused on reducing world poverty. He was the first World Bank leader to make this the organization's top priority and he was often praised for this. McNamara also helped the World Bank fight disease. He retired from the World Bank in 1981.\nHe wrote a memoir in 1995. McNamara enjoyed food and cooking, and started an orchard business in his retirement. A movie was released made of interviews and clips about McNamara in 2003 called the Fog of War. He was a trustee of the California Institute of Technology and the Brookings Institution. There is a scholarship of the World Bank in his honor.\nIn his later list McNamara said that he and the Kennedy and Johnson administrations \"were wrong\" about Vietnam. He said if he had known in the 1960s what he knows now he would've made a different decision.\nMcNamara died in Washington DC in 2009. He was 93 when he died. He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia."}

People who immigrate are called immigrants. Some are illegal immigrants. Some immigrants are refugees and some ask for political asylum. \nIf someone wants to immigrate to the United States, that person has to apply to become a legal citizen. If the person is accepted, they will receive a green card. A green card is a piece of evidence stating that the person is trying to legally stay within the country's borders. The person must keep the green card for at least five years in order to become a citizen of the United States of America. (USA-GOV pg. 1) \n\"Immigrant\" and \"emigrant\" both describe human migration. The same people are \"emigrants\" when they leave their own country or region, and \"immigrants\" when they arrive somewhere else.\nThe phrases \"many people emigrated from Europe in the 19th century to America\" and \"many people immigrated to America from Europe in the 19th century\" have the same meaning.\nReasons for immigration.\nAs with other changes, people go to another place for several reasons:\nDifficulty of immigration.\nImmigration has always been difficult. When people immigrate, they leave behind their friends, families, and culture. They also have to sell what they have, like a house, farm, or anything else too big to bring. Immigrating is also difficult because of the strict Immigration laws and qualifications within each country. It is hard to become a legal citizen of a country. It takes time (about 5 years in the US) and a lot of patience to become legally apart of a country. (USA-GOV pg. 1)\nLearning different languages in order to feel comfortable in a country is also extremely difficult for some people They might not have the opportunity to go a to school and learn certain things. Not knowing or beginning to learn the language of a country the person immigrates to can be very uncomfortable at first. This is because communication is needed within our everyday lives, such as at work, in grocery stores, restaurants, and just everyday life. (Global Citizen, 2014, par. 3)\nTravelling can also be very expensive. Many immigrants have to use all their money to pay fees or plane tickets.\nOnce immigrants arrive in the new countries, they can face many difficulties. They may have to get a job, find a house, and learn a new language. Immigrants can also be victims of racism."}

Often the pleasure is of a sexual kind. When a person finds pleasure in being hurt or humiliated, their condition is called Masochism.\nThe terms \"sadism\" and \"masochism\" were both invented by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist. He named Sadism after the Marquis de Sade, a French nobleman who in the eighteenth century wrote many books, stories and plays. Sade's books include many characters who find pleasure in cruelty, including torture and even murder.\nThese kind of people usually enjoy when others are hurt, but specific ones love pain in general. Most of the time people who are masochistic or sadistic are sad in real life.\nThe condition is often fetishized on the internet and sometimes related to self-doubt or self-hate.\nDifferent forms of Sadism.\nAt first Sadism meant only cruelty for sexual pleasure, but as the word became more widely used its meaning changed. Nowadays any person who enjoys being cruel to others can be called \"sadistic,\" even if they get no sexual excitement from what they do.\nSome people who have sadistic sexual fantasies mean no real harm to anyone. In BDSM a \"top\" or dominant person will bind his or her partner or \"punish\" them in different ways, but what they do will not go beyond limits which the partner has agreed on. On the other hand, a small minority are severely perverted or mentally ill, and wish to act out their sadistic fantasies for real. Such people are rare, but they can be very dangerous. Many serial killers and psychopaths have been sexual sadists.\nTreating sadism.\nTreating sadism is difficult, but it looks like psychotherapy can help in certain cases. Note: It has not been proven that people with sadism can be successfully treated. The former statement is not accurate."}

This allows multiple computers to share a single public IP address, which has become necessary because there are not enough IP addresses for every computer in the world.\nToday, NAT is used to hide networks (called \"network masquerading\") or to hide IP (called \"IP masquerading\"). \"Masquerading\" is the mechanism that hides an entire address space, usually consisting of private network addresses (RFC 1918), behind a single IP address usually in the public domain address space. \nThe NAT mechanism is implemented inside a routing device that keeps track of the \"state\" of the network connections. The NAT device may also implement a firewall. The router uses translation tables to map the \"hidden\" addresses into a single address and then rewrites the outgoing IP packets on exit from the router so that they appear to originate from the router. In the reverse communications path, responses to the outgoing packets are mapped back to the originating IP address using the reverse of the rules (\"state\") stored in the translation tables. The outgoing IP packets establish the device translation tables.\nThe translation table rules established in the above way are cleared after a short period without new traffic refreshing their \"state\". However, most NAT devices today allow the network administrator to configure translation tables\u2019 entries for permanent use. This feature is often referred to as \"static NAT\" or port forwarding and allows traffic originating in the 'outside' network to reach selected hosts in the \"masqueraded network\".\nCarrier-grade NAT, also called large-scale NAT, is NAT done by the Internet service provider (ISP). This is used when the ISP has more customers than IP addresses. This is commonly used by cellular service providers on 3G and 4G networks, but it is not (yet) common on landline DSL or cable connections. The CIDR address block 100.64.0.0/10 is reserved for carrier-grade NAT, although many ISPs improperly use RFC 1918 private addresses, which are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.\nNAT is used only in IPv4. It is not necessary in IPv6, because IPv6 has enough addresses for every computer in the world to have a global address."}

Routers make sure traffic between computers goes where it needs to go. They do this by choosing the shortest path between the computers using a complicated system of rules called routing protocols. Routers generally contain a specialized operating system, RAM, NVRAM, flash memory, and one or more processors, as well as two or more network interfaces. They come in a variety of sizes from something you could hold in your hand to something too large for one person to lift.\nIf you have an Internet connection, you probably have a router somewhere that your computer sends data to. This is the first router your computer will connect to in order to get to the internet. It is also known as a default gateway (because it is your gateway to the internet). By convention the gateway has the lowest IP address (like a phone number for a computer) in the subnet (a group of addresses). Anytime you make a connection (such as a connection to www.wikipedia.org) your computer looks up the IP address using the look-up service called DNS (Domain Name Service). Once the destination address has been found your computer connects to your gateway router. The gateway then sends data to a router at your ISP (Internet Service Provider), that router can be said to be part of the internet and connects to other routers until the data reaches the destination.\nIn small networks such as homes, small businesses (including internet caf\u00e9s) and small schools, the router also performs NAT (network address translation) which makes all outgoing connections look like they come from one address. Typically, incoming connections are only allowed if they are replies to connections made by a computer inside the NAT.\nRouters connect two or more networks and direct traffic between them. These networks may be physical (the network is associated with a port) or logical (not associated with a port on the router). The term layer 3 switch often is used the same as 'router', but it is a general term without a technical definition. Layer 3 switch implies a device that is built to connect Ethernet devices in a LAN but can also perform routing.\nRouter operating systems are split into two parts:"}

People who suffer from it can get pleasure from being hurt or humiliated by others. Often, the pleasure is sexual. When a person gets pleasure from being the one who causes hurt or humiliation, their condition is called Sadism.\nThe word \"masochism\" was invented by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist. He named it after Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836-1895), a writer whose books and stories often featured men in love with women who treated them cruelly.\nDifferent forms of Masochism.\nMany people with masochistic feelings do not really want to be hurt badly. They want to act out their daydreams, such as being tied up and kidnapped, or becoming the slave of another person. In BDSM, people often agree who will be \"dominant/dom\" and \"submissive/sub\" before they do anything together, and talk about exactly what they will do before they do it. People who do this kind of masochism usually do it for sexual excitement.\nMost people who practice BDSM are concerned about their partner's safety. When people are careless about safety, or have no partner and play masochistic games when they are alone, it can be very dangerous. In some cases people have died from such games, especially when they involve suffocation, like hanging or rubber masks, even more dangerous when making it hard to get out by putting themselves in things like handcuffs.\nSome people suffer from emotional masochism. They are more comfortable when they feel sad or consider themselves failures in life, or prefer to be in a relationship with someone who cheats or insults them. People who have these kind of feelings may have been bullied or abused earlier in life, or may feel that they do not deserve success and happiness.\nSometimes, self-injury is seen as a form of masochism which is not motivated sexually. Other behaviours, such as nail biting or trichotillomania often occur in situations where there is a lot of stress or pressure on the individual. While they are related to the individual's way to deal with stressful situations, they are also often rooted in the personality.\nTreating masochism.\nTreating masochism is difficult, but it looks like psychotherapy can help in some cases. People who like to be hurt during sex often say they're happy, though. Even not in sex, masochism can be natural in people."}

{"id": "136305", "revid": "1050767", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136305", "title": "Private network", "text": "In Internet terminology a private network is typically a network that uses private IP address space, following the RFC 1918 standard. Computers may be allocated addresses from this address space when it is necessary for them to communicate with other computing devices on an Intranet network (internal private computer network that uses the Internet Protocol).\nPrivate networks are quite common in home and office local area network (LAN) designs, as many organizations do not see a need for globally unique IP addresses for every computer, printer and other devices that the organizations use. Private IP addresses were created due to the shortage of publicly registered IP addresses created by the IPv4 standard. One of the reasons IPv6 was created is to overcome this limitation of the IPv4 standard. However IPv6 still did not achieve a widespread use.\nRouters on the Internet should be configured to discard any packets containing private IP addresses in the IP packet header. This isolation gives private networks a basic form of security as it is not usually possible for the outside world to establish a connection directly to a machine using these private addresses. As connections cannot be made between different private networks via the internet, different organizations can use the same private address range without risking address conflicts (communications accidents caused by reaching a third party using the same IP address).\nIf a device on a private network needs to communicate with other networks, a \"mediating gateway\" (in-between gateway) is needed to ensure that the outside network is presented with an address that is \"real\" (or publicly reachable) so that Internet routers allow the communication. This gateway is typically a NAT device or a proxy server. Public Internet Routers by default will not forward packets with RFC 1918 addresses. Unlike public Internet routers that need additional configuration to forward these packets, internal routers do not need any additional configuration to forward these packets.\nThis can cause problems, however, when organizations try to connect networks that both use the same private address spaces. There is a potential for clashes and routing problems if both networks use the same IP addresses for their private networks, or if both networks depend on NAT to connect them through the Internet.\nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) private addresses.\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the entity that manage global IP address allocation, DNS root zone management, media types, and other Internet protocol assignments. It is operated by ICANN.\nFor someone familiar with the boundaries of classful addressing, it is important to note that even though the RFC 1918 range of 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 falls in the traditional class B range, the block of addresses reserved is not a /16, but a /12. The same applies for the range of 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255; this block is not a /24, but a /16. However, someone can still (and many individuals typically do) use addresses from these CIDR blocks and apply a subnet mask appropriate for the traditional classful boundary of the address.\nThe current IANA \"private internet\" (also called non-routable) addresses are:\nTo reduce the load on root nameservers caused by the reverse DNS lookups of these IP addresses, a system of \"black-hole\" nameservers is provided by anycast network AS112."}

Triple DES is also known as TDES or, more standard, TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm ).\nWhen it was discovered that a 56-bit key of DES is not enough to protect from brute force attacks, TDES was chosen as a simple way to enlarge the key space without a need to switch to a new algorithm. The use of three steps is essential to prevent meet-in-the-middle attacks that are effective against double DES encryption.\nIn general TDES with three different keys (3-key {k1, k2, k3} TDES) has a key length of 168 bits: three 56-bit DES keys (with parity bits 3-key TDES has the total storage length of 192 bits), but due to the meet-in-the-middle attack the effective security it provides is only 112 bits. Another version, called two-key TDES (2-key TDES), uses k1 = k3, thus reducing the key size to 112 bits and the storage length to 128 bits. However, this mode can be taken advantage of through certain chosen-plaintext or known-plaintext attacks and so TDES is treated by NIST to have only 80 bits of security.\nBy design, DES and therefore TDES, suffer from slow performance in software. TDES is better suited to hardware implementations, which are many of the places it is still used.\nTDES is slowly disappearing from use, largely replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). One large-scale exception is within the electronic payments industry, which still uses 2TDES extensively and continues to develop and spread standards based upon it (e.g. EMV, the standard for inter-operation of IC cards; also called \"Chip cards\", and IC capable POS terminals and ATM's). This guarantees that TDES will remain an active cryptographic standard well into the future."}

However, two or three of those points are non-elimination. In Seasons 1-4, there was no penalty for coming in last in a non-elimination. From Seasons 5-9, teams had to give up all of their money and start the next leg without money. Even stricter, in Seasons 7-9, teams had to turn over all of their luggage.

Until the COVID-19 recession, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 is considered the worst financial crisis during the 21st century.\nIn September 2008 many large financial firms in the United States collapsed, merged, or went under conservatorship (a person is assigned to manage a company when it cannot manage itself). The factors that led to the crisis were reported in business journals many months before September 2008.\nBackground and causes.\nThere are many reasons why the crisis happened. Most economists believe that it started in the United States. From 1997 until 2006, people bought expensive houses, even though they did not have enough money for it. Since the money had come from other countries, it was easy to have good credit. People used this credit for expensive loans, causing the price of homes to rise. This created an economic bubble. Because they had a lot of money, the loaning companies made it easier to get a loan, even if the borrower didn't have a good credit history. These loans are known as subprime loans.\nDuring this time, many home owners refinanced their homes. This caused their mortgage to change, giving them lower interest. After they refinanced, homeowners could take out another mortgage, for spending money. The loaning companies changed their loans so that they would have low interest at first and then increase later. This is known as an adjustable-rate mortgage. The companies often used these to convince more people to take loans. Many people with subprime loans also took these adjustable-rate mortgages, hoping that the good price of housing would help them refinance later.\nWhile the housing prices were still high, many American and European companies, including banks, invested in subprime loans. These investments gave more money to the loaning companies, who used it to give out more subprime loans. These investments would make a lot of money as long as the price of housing was high. \nHowever, the housing companies built too many houses. This caused the price of housing to decrease beginning in the summer of 2006. The value of many homes dropped below the value of the remaining mortgage debt, so the owners were unable to sell and move away. This is called negative equity. About 8.8 million homeowners in the U.S. had zero or negative equity by March 2008. This caused the number of foreclosures on homes to increase, meaning that many people lost their homes. During 2007, almost 1.3 million U.S. homes began foreclosure proceedings. The number of houses for sale continued to increase, which made the prices decrease. The homeowners with subprime loans left their houses with less value than they had when they were bought, which meant that the loans were worth more money than the house. The loaning companies were not able to make money from these houses.\nThe collapse of the housing bubble caused the value of investments to fall. The companies that had invested in subprime loans lost a total of about $512 billion. Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were two companies that lost the most money. More than half of the money lost, $260 billion, was lost by American firms.\nTotal financial losses from lost economic activity and stock market declines have been estimated at $15 trillion."}

Some of the main events take hundreds of millions of years, others happen annually.\nThe main ways that carbon gets into the carbon cycle are volcanoes, and the burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas. Through most of history, volcanoes were the biggest source of carbon to the carbon cycle, but in the last hundred years, people burning fossil fuels have been adding about a hundred times more CO2 to the air than volcanoes. That is, for every ton of CO2 added to the air by volcanoes, about 100 tons of CO2 have been added to the air by people.\nThe main way carbon gets taken out of the atmosphere is by photosynthesis by living organisms. Some of this gets released as they die and decompose, but a proportion gets buried in sediment. This is shown in the diagram. Sediment turns to rock, and it is the carbonate rocks like limestone which contain the now-solid CO2. Some of the carbon from plants also becomes part of the soil, where it can stay for a long time before decomposing.\nAnother process takes CO2 out of the air. Weathering by rain washes out CO2 in the form of dilute carbonic acid. This reacts with rock, helping to dissolve and destroy it. This also ends up as sediment.\nSome CO2 is also dissolved in the ocean. Right now, the oceans are taking in more CO2 than they are releasing, every year. However, this is making the oceans more acidic.\nThe store of carbon in sedimentary rock is far greater than the CO2 in the atmosphere (this is not shown in the diagram). Eventually it returns to the air as oceanic plates subduct in plate tectonics. At the margins of plate boundaries (and some other places) volcanoes form and spew out CO2. This completes the cycle.\nSummary.\nThe carbon cycle is a process where carbon is recycled through the ecosystem. The concentration of carbon in living matter (18%) is almost 100 times greater than its concentration in the earth (0.19%). So living things extract carbon from their nonliving environment. For life to continue, this carbon must be recycled. See the diagram for a detailed look at the carbon cycle. An example of a route carbon takes in this cycle is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by plants and used in photosynthesis to produce sugars which the plant uses for energy. When the plant dies, it decomposes and the carbon stored in the plant will, over millions of years, form into coal (a fossil fuel). The coal is burnt and gives off carbon dioxide which goes into the atmosphere. \nAt the moment, the carbon cycle, and how human activity is affecting it, is a big topic in international news. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable resource which means that they cannot be replaced easily. Our use of fossil fuels has nearly doubled every 20 years since 1900. This release of carbon dioxide contributes to the greenhouse effect and acid rain.\nThe carbon cycle was discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and popularized by Humphry Davy."}

The Greek Sophists of the 5th century BC, such as Protagoras of Abdera (480\u2013411 BC), were mostly skeptics. Gorgias (485\u2013380 BC) said, \"Nothing exists; if anything does exist, it cannot be known; if anything exists and can be known, it cannot be communicated\". In the 4th century BC Pyrrho of Elis (c360\u2013275 BC), who travelled and studied as far as India, adopted practical skepticism. Carneades (c213\u2013129 BC) disagreed that things were completely true or false. He criticized the Dogmatists, especially Stoics. He said that completely certain knowledge is impossible. Sextus Empiricus (c200 AD), the main authority for Greek skepticism, brought together empiricism into the basis for stating knowledge.\nSkepticism comes from Asian philosophy, too. The Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi (c369\u2013c286 BC) said that what seems real could be just a dream. In Indian philosophy, the C\u0101rv\u0101ka school thought that we should neither try to infer knowledge nor trust what other people tell us. In Buddhism, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna said that nothing exists by itself, and that this idea is an important part of enlightenment.\nThe most important part of the argument is that unless we know \"something\" for certain, then we cannot know \"anything\". The interest lies in the way great philosophers have tried to solve this problem. Some, like Descartes, retreat into the mind: \"I think, therefore I am.\" Others, such as the British empiricists John Locke and David Hume, would rely on our sense perception. Certain kinds of knowledge may be especially vulnerable to skepticism. For example, an agnostic believes people cannot get knowledge about supernatural things. \nSkepticism is widely used as a method for research in science, and (with changes) in modern legal procedure. Here doubt, suspending judgement, careful investigation, testing and discussion come before any statement of facts. Sometimes the process takes years before consensus is reached. This systematic approach is called \"methodological skepticism\". It is probably the most important legacy of the skeptics."}
