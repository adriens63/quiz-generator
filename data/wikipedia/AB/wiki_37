Many junior high school students in Japan study this short story in class.\nIn 2009, a movie based on this story was released.\nPlot.\nConstruction of a light railway has begun between Odawara and Atami, two towns in east Japan. At the construction site, workers are using minecarts for transporting earth and sand. Ry\u014dhei, aged eight, is interested in these minecarts. One day, he pushes one of the minecarts with a construction worker. At the beginning, he is very excited. But as it gets late in the day, he starts to worry about how he will get home. After a while, the construction worker tells him to go home because it is late. Ry\u014dhei runs down a dark hill road thinking \u201cI just don\u2019t want to die\u201d. As soon as he comes back home, he bursts into tears.\nHe becomes an adult and moves to Tokyo. He looks back on that time. He is tired of everyday life. Without any reason, he sometimes dreams of the dark hill road.\nThe story is set between Odawara and Atami. The boy describes seeing the sea on his right as he heads away from his home, and on his left on the way back. Because of this, it seems that he was moving toward Odawara from Atami.\nAdditional information.\nRikiishi Heizo was a journalist from Yugawara, a town between Atami and Odawara. The Atami light railway was under construction when he was a boy. Construction workers changed a human-powered railway into a light railway. Rikiishi looked back on his memory of watching this construction work and wrote it down. The story\u2019s author, Akutagawa, embellished Rikiishi\u2019s writing to make the story."}

The animals live in a endosymbiotic relationship with single-celled algae. To get sunlight the corals live just below sea level. The algae make food products for the coral polyp by photosynthesis.\nCoral polyps are sensitive to changes in their environment. This includes the temperature of the water they live in. Under stress, coral polyps may expel the algae which live inside their tissues. The algae provide up to 90% of the coral's energy. Bleached corals continue to live but begin to starve after bleaching. Some corals recover.\nWarmer sea water temperatures caused by global warming is the leading cause of coral bleaching.\nThe United Nations Environment Programme says that the longest recorded global bleaching events happened between 2014 and 2016. Coral was killed on an unprecedented scale. In 2016, bleaching of coral on the Great Barrier Reef killed between 29 and 50 percent of the reef's coral. \nIn 2017, the bleaching got into the central region of the reef. The interval between bleaching events has halved between 1980 and 2016.\nRecent research showed that the coral-algae relationship is much older than was thought. This suggests it has survived many climate changes.\nSome corals change color instead of turning white when they are bleached. The colors can be very bright. In May 2020, scientists from the University of Southampton said that the colors act like sunscreen and protect the coral cells from light. The scientists said this means some corals can lose their algae for a while and might have developed bright colors as a way to make it easier for the algae to come back and to stay alive until then."}

Humala entered the Peruvian Army in 1981, eventually achieveing the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. During his time in the military, he fought in the internal conflict against far-left terrorist group Shining Path as well as in the Cenepa War with neighboring Ecuador. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful coup d'etatagainst President Alberto Fujimori during the dying days of his regime; eventually, Congress granted him amnesty and Humala was allowed to return to military duty.\nIn 2005, Humala entered electoral politics, founding the Peruvian Nationalist Party (PNP) in order to run in the 2006 presidential election. Having received first place in the first round, he faced former centre-left President and APRA candidate Alan Garc\u00eda in the second round, ultimately losing by a narrow margin. His campaign received widespread international attention in 2006 given the recent success of left-wing politicians in Latin America. In 2011, he would once again run for President, and narrowly defeated Keiko Fujimori in the runoff.\nHumala's election initially concerned investors, who feared he would govern similar to far-left Venezuelan PresidentHugo Chavez, a former ally of his. To assuage these fears, Humala would begin his term by choosing centrists for positions in his cabinet. Humala's unpopular presidency was dominated by corruption scandals surrounding him and his politically influential wife Nadine Heredia. Environmentalists were highly critical of Humala's mining policies, and argued that he reneged on his campaign promise to reign in mining companies.\nHumala was arrested by Peruvian authorities in July 2017 for illegally accepting bribes and awaits a corruption trial.\nHumala ran for president again in 2021, but lost in the first round of the election."}

He also played with the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, the last with whom he won an NBA championship. He was nicknamed \"The Glove\" by his cousin during the 1993 Western Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns when he held his opponent Kevin Johnson defensively \"like a glove\" on the court. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 8, 2013. Payton is considered by many to be the greatest defensive guard of all time and one of the greatest defenders in basketball history. He used his quick feet in order to master the art of staying in front of his opponent on defense. He was also one of the best at guarding Michael Jordan, although in the 1996 NBA Finals the Sonics largely used Hersey Hawkins to guard Jordan.

He was also a nine-time NBA All-Star and a nine-time All-NBA Team member.\nPayton ranks fourth in steals, eighth in assists and 32nd in points among the NBA's career leaders.

It can be heard locally on the radio, and it also streams online. It is the longest-running Christian radio station in the United States. The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod (LCMS) owns and runs the station. It broadcasts talk programs about the Bible, theology, and society. It also plays Lutheran sacred music. The station broadcasts four Lutheran church services on the weekends.\nKFUO's studios are in the LCMS headquarters in Kirkwood, Missouri. The transmitter is located at Concordia Seminary in Clayton.\nKFUO broadcasts on the same frequency as KOA (AM) in Denver, Colorado. KOA is a clear-channel station. Because of this, KFUO must stop at night. The station's website plays sacred music when the 850 AM signal is off the air.\nHistory.\nOn February 19, 1923, Richard Kretzschmar said that there should be a Lutheran radio station. This happened at a meeting of the Board of Control of Concordia Seminary. Then they raised money from students and other Lutheran organizations. Then they started a \"radio committee\" to oversee the project.\nSoon afterwards, construction for the station began at the seminary. At this time, it was located in St. Louis. The control room and studio for the station were located in the attic of one of the seminary buildings. The license to broadcast was issued on October 25, 1924. The station went on air for the first time the next day. It broadcast a speech about the laying of the cornerstone for the new seminary being constructed in Clayton. The station was formally dedicated and began regular broadcasting on December 14, 1924. In 1927, the station moved to the new campus of Concordia Seminary in Clayton.\nAt first, KFUO had to share frequences with other stations. The FCC approved the station to move to 830\u00a0kHz on July 1, 1940. By September 1941, the FCC reassigned the station to 850\u00a0kHz, where it has remained to this day. It also received a \"limited time\" license because this was the same frequency as KOA in Denver. KFUO can only operate between 80.5 and 102.5 hours per week. The exact hours depend on the times of sunrise and sunset in Denver.\nThe LCMS started the FM station KFUO-FM at 99.1\u00a0MHz in 1948. At first, the FM station broadcast the same thing as the AM station. In 1975, KFUO-FM switched to broadcasting classical music. In March 2010 the FM station was sold to Gateway Creative Broadcasting. On July 7, 2010 of that year it switched to a Contemporary Christian format.\nIn 1997, the FCC said that the LCMS's radio stations had violated the FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. The FCC said that KFUO and KFUO-FM did not hire enough minorities, women, and non-Lutherans. The LCMS lost an appeal within the FCC, and then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court found, in Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod v. FCC (1998), that the FCC's requirements were unconstitutional.\nKFUO began streaming its broadcast on the station's web site, kfuo.org, in 1998. In 2004, KFUO started its HD radio station, the first in Missouri.\nIn 2008, there was a controversy about the theological talk show, \"Issues, Etc.\". The program was removed from the station on March 18. The producer and host were also fired. Three weeks later, the management of KFUO announced that \"Issues, Etc.\" was canceled because the station did not have enough money for it. The station did not make its financial information public. About 75 people had a peaceful protest outside the LCMS International Center to question the station's motives. More than 7,000 people signed a petition online to ask for the program to be returned. The program started again on another local Christian radio station on June 30, 2008. On March 13, 2012, the program returned to KFUO. The company that now produces it, Lutheran Public Radio, now pays KFUO for airtime.\nThe studios of KFUO were moved to the LCMS International Center, the LCMS's headquarters in Kirkwood, Missouri, on June 24, 2013.

Several members of the coalition had previously been fighting France in the Third Coalition, and there wasn't any peace in between wars. On October 9, 1806, Prussia joined a new coalition, fearing that France was becoming more powerful after it defeated Austria and established the Confederation of the Rhine. Prussia and Russia prepared for a new campaign. Prussian troops moved to Saxony.\nOn 14 October 1806, the French defeated the Prussian army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt. Then French forces occupied Prussia and captured Berlin. Later they advanced towards Poland and Russia. On 7-8 February 1807, the French and Russian armies fought the Battle of Eylau. There was no clear winner. On 14 June 1807, the French defeated the Russians at the Battle of Friedland. In July 1807, France made peace with Russia, ending the war. This left Napoleon as ruler of most of western and central Europe. The exceptions were Spain, Portugal, Austria, and a few smaller states. These were able to remain independent. \nEven though the Fourth Coalition came to an end, Britain remained at war with France. "}

Then her trial became famous and many free speech activists defended her. In May 2018 she was found guilty, and in July 2018 she was sent to prison for six months. She served 42 days in prison and was set free on September 20, 2018.\nTrial.\nAt Tatour's trial, a police officer translated her poem, \"Resist them, my people, resist them.\" This police officer was not a professional translator and did not have experience with literature. Tatour's defense team invited a professional translator. Tatour's accusers said the professional translator was biased.\nTatour's accusers also showed one of her Facebook posts.

They said that the Russian Empire and British Mandate of Palestine did not put Jewish writers on trial for \"much harsher words.\"\nProtests.\nMany writers protested her arrest. In June 2016, there was a protest in Tel Aviv. Almost 20 poets, writers and translators read their writing. Sami Michael wrote that her arrest showed that Israel was helpless and its culture had failed. He said that Israel could not defend itself but could only make writers be quiet. The poet Lilach Weber also wrote a poem about her.\nIn October 2016 more than 180 poets, writers and intellectuals asked for her freedom. Four of them were winners of the Israel Prize: A. B. Yehoshua, Tuvia Rivner, Avishai Margalit and Shimon Sandbank. The statement said Tatour was \"arrested and tried for writing a poem.\" They believed this went against \"democracy, free speech and creativity.\" They added that it made it difficult for Arabs and Jews to talk to each other and end the Arab-Israeli conflict. A poet and activist named Tal Nitzan led these efforts.\nAfter she was found guilty, PEN International wrote that she was only doing her job as a writer: \"we use our words to peacefully challenge injustice.\"\nFreedom.\nTatour was set free on September 20, 2018."}

Two years later, the seminary purchased land east of Fort Wayne and built the first building on its new campus.\nOther people in the LCMS called Concordia Theological Seminary the \"practical seminary\", because it tried to teach men to become pastors quickly. It taught pre-seminary and seminary classes. The pre-seminary classes were similar to high school classes. The seminary classes taught theology. At this time, it did not teach Greek and Hebrew, the languages that the Bible was originally written in.\nIn 1861, the seminary moved to the campus of Concordia Seminary, in St. Louis, Missouri. This is the synod's other seminary. This was done so that students wouldn't be drafted for the American Civil War.\nIn 1874, the pre-seminary students and one instructor were moved to the campus of the former Illinois State University in Springfield, Illinois. The next year, 1875, the \"practical seminary\" itself moved to the Springfield campus.\nIn 1918, an additional year of instruction was added to the pre-seminary courses. These additional courses made pastors eligible to get teaching certificates. After 1935, Greek was made a required course.\nStarting in 1941, all entering students had to be high school graduates. The seminary then stopped teaching high school classes. Later, they required two years of college for entering students.\nIn 1976, the seminary returned to Fort Wayne.\nAcademics.\nThe seminary has four departments: Exegetical Theology, Historical Theology, Pastoral Ministry and Mission, and Systematic Theology."}

Avenatti is best known for suing President Donald Trump on behalf of porn star Stormy Daniels in an attempt to prove that Trump paid Daniels to stay silent during their affair.\nAvenatti said that he would run for president in 2020 if Trump runs for re-election and if no other candidate is good enough to beat Trump.\nEarly life.\nBorn on February 16, 1971 in Sacramento, California, Avenatti spent his early childhood in Colorado and Utah. He moved with his family to Chesterfield, Missouri, near St. Louis, in 1982, where he attended Parkway Central High School. After graduating in 1989, Avenatti attended Saint Louis University for a year before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a B.A. in political science in 1996.\nHe attended George Washington University Law School, where he graduated Order of the Coif and first in his class with a J.D. in 2000. In 2003, George Washington University Law School established the Michael J. Avenatti Award for Excellence in Pre-Trial and Trial Advocacy, an annual award given to the member of the graduating Juris Doctor class who demonstrates excellence in pre-trial and trial advocacy. Avenatti also received George Washington University's prestigious Alumni Recognition Award in 2010.\nCareer.\nWhile in college and later in law school, Avenatti worked at The Research Group, a political opposition research and media firm run by Rahm Emanuel (later White House Chief of Staff for President Barack Obama, and Mayor of Chicago). Avenatti worked on over 150 Democratic and Republican campaigns in 42 states while studying at George Washington University.\nAfter law school, Avenatti worked at O'Melveny &amp; Myers in Los Angeles, California, alongside Daniel M. Petrocelli, who previously represented the Ron Goldman family in its case against O.J. Simpson. He assisted Petrocelli on multiple legal matters, including the representation of singer Christina Aguilera and litigation surrounding the movie \"K-19: The Widowmaker\", and worked extensively for Don Henley and Glenn Frey of the musical group the Eagles, including in a suit brought by former bandmate Don Felder against the group and Irving Azoff.\nAvenatti later joined Greene Broillet &amp; Wheeler, a Los Angeles boutique law firm. While there, he handled a number of high-profile cases, including a $10 million defamation case against Paris Hilton, settled an idea-theft lawsuit relating to the show \"The Apprentice\" and against producers Mark Burnett and Donald Trump, and a $40 million embezzlement lawsuit involving KPMG.\nIn 2007, Avenatti formed the law firm Eagan Avenatti, LLP (formerly known as Eagan O'Malley &amp; Avenatti, LLP) with offices in Newport Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco, California. He has since appeared on \"60 Minutes\" three times in connection with cases he has handled. Avenatti has also served as lead counsel on a number of historically large cases, including an April 2017 $454 million verdict after a jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles in a fraud case against Kimberly-Clark and Halyard Health, later reduced to a $21.7 million verdict upon appeal, an $80.5 million class-action settlement against Service Corporation International, a $41 million jury verdict against KPMG, and a $39 million malicious prosecution settlement.\nIn 2013 Avenatti formed a company, Global Baristas, to buy Seattle-based Tully's Coffee out of bankruptcy. Since 2015, Global Baristas has been named in more than 50 lawsuits in state and federal courts for breach of contract, unpaid bills, and unpaid taxes.\nIn 2015, Avenatti prevailed against the National Football League (NFL) following a jury trial in Dallas. He later pursued a class-action suit on behalf of fans who showed up for Super Bowl XLV with tickets that didn't correspond to actual seats but the courts in Texas declined to certify the class. Later, in 2016, Avenatti filed another class action lawsuit against the NFL, this time on behalf of ticket-holders to the annual Hall of Fame Game, which was cancelled a few hours before kickoff.\nIn 2017, a Florida man named Gerald Tobin alleged Avenatti failed to pay him $28,700 for private investigatory work. As a result, Avenatti's firm was abruptly forced into bankruptcy. The issue was resolved when the pair entered into a Non-Disclosure Agreement, and Avenatti paid Tobin the $28,700.\nIn 2018, Avenatti's law firm was subjected to a $10 million judgment in U.S. bankruptcy court. In June 2018, a former partner filed a motion in U.S. bankruptcy court asking for a lien on any and all legal fees Avenatti's firm might collect, up to $10 million, from clients in 54 cases including his representation of Stormy Daniels.\nAvenatti has on several occasions, including in a post to Twitter, expressed interest in running for president in 2020. In a CBC TV interview published in September 2018, Avenatti said he would run in 2020 only against Trump or Pence."}

Other related models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania, Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia-related disorders.\nNot all people agree that the condition sexual addicion exists.

It will reach to within 8.86 solar radii (6.2 million kilometers or 3.85 million miles) from the \"surface\" of the Sun and will travel, at closest approach, as fast as .\nOverview.\nIt was launched on August 12, 2018. This was the first time a NASA spacecraft was named after a living person, honoring physicist Eugene Parker.\nA memory card having the names of over 1.1 million people was mounted on a plaque and installed below the spacecraft\u2019s high-gain antenna on May 18, 2018.\nThe card also contains photos of Parker, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and a copy of his 1958 scientific paper.\nSpecial Material Technology.\nBecause of how close the probe will be to the Sun, it will experience very high temperatures. To make sure that the probe is not damaged by the hot environment, engineers had to design a special shield to protect the sensitive components on the probe. The shield is made up of five layers. The outermost layer is a white ceramic layer which reflects away the Sun's rays. By reflecting the rays away, it prevents the shield from heating up too much. The second layer is a barrier layer which connects the ceramic layer to the middle layer. The middle layer is a carbon-carbon sheet which is very light and strong. This helps keep the shield in one piece. The fourth layer is a carbon foam which is very light and does not conduct heat well. This again helps with keeping the temperature low. The fifth and final layer is a second carbon sheet which makes the entire shield rigid enough for spaceflight.\nSince the probe was launched from a rocket, it was very important to minimize its weight. If it was too heavy, the rocket would not be able to launch it far enough to complete its mission. Because of the well engineered materials in the shield, the entire shield only weighs 73 kg. That is about the same weight as an average adult human."}

He lost the general election to Cruz.\nAfter the 2018 election, O'Rourke had been seen as a possible candidate for President of the United States in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. Other analysts have seen O'Rourke as the Democratic vice presidential candidate.\nOn March 13, 2019, O'Rourke announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for President. He ended his bid on November 1, 2019. In November 2021, he said that he is running for Governor of Texas in the 2022 election.\nEarly life.\nO'Rourke was born on September 26, 1972 in El Paso, Texas, to Pat Francis O'Rourke and his second wife Melissa Martha O'Rourke (n\u00e9e Williams).

The Curtiss Flying Service bought farmland in the Glenview region and opened the airfield as an alternative to Chicago's Municipal Airport. But the Great Depression, which started just nine days after the airfield was dedicated, reduced the need for another regular airport for Chicago. During the Depression, the main source of income for the airport was air shows. However, in the late 1930s, there were also some commercial routes to and from the airfield.\nIn the 1930s, the airfield was used as a training center for military airmen. In 1937, the U.S. Navy moved to the airbase. (\"Although the airport managed to survive . . . the Great Depression, the navy's decision to relocate the Great Lakes aviation program to Glenview likely saved Curtiss Airfield.\" ) The United States Naval Reserve Aviation Base (NRAB) was the name given to the training unit. On November 1, 1939, the base was notified that the Department of the navy had approved a lease on the airport. When the United States joined World War Two, activity increased at the base. It became a major training base for training pilots water-related flying. This included training for aircraft carrier-based flights.\nAfter the war, the base reduced its activities. In 1950, though, marines and naval personnel from the base were called up to fight in the Korean War. Later in the 1950s, and in the later decades, the base hosted various community events such as national model-airplane contests In 1963, the Seabees became based there. In 1971, the base was officially annexed by the village of Glenview.\nDuring the Vietnam War, military activity at the base increased. This included serving as the receiving base of wounded personnel who were being taken to Great Lakes Naval Hospital for treatment.\nIn the 1980s, the base population grew. Military units present at the base included the u. S. Coast Guard's search and rescue unit for southern Lake Michigan.\nIn 1991, personnel from NASG took part in Operation Desert Storm. But the end of the base had already been established years before, by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, in 1988. In 1993, the last NASG air show was performed before 70,000 viewers. In August 1994, the last KC-130 flight out of the airfield left for NAS Carswell, Fort Worth, Texas.\nAfter the air station was closed, most of the facilities were torn down, and the area was converted to civilian use, including a prairie nature area, upscale housing, and a shopping district (Glen Town Center)centered around the old Hangar One, which was preserved and incorporated into a shopping mall, in a part of Glenview now called The Glen. The small, associated Navy Park and the rededicated hangar were opened in 2003. The old hangar is on the National Register of Historic Places."}

They said a too-thin steel plate ripped along a line of rivets. Also, additional weight at the time due to ongoing rehabilitation construction led to the major failure that caused the bridge to fall into the Mississippi River. It later was replaced with the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge which opened in September 2008. The new bridge that opened in 2008 carries 10 lanes."}

It is also called phantosmia. It can occur in one nostril or both. Phantosmia with unpleasant smells, which is called cacosmia, is more common. It is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten. Experiencing phantom smells from time to time is normal and usually goes away on its own. When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, this can be very upsetting and can lower an individual's quality of life.\nCommon medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps, or dental problems can cause phantom smells. A phantom smell can also result from neurological conditions such as migraines, head injuries, strokes, Parkinson's disease, seizures, or brain tumors. It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, intoxication or withdrawal from drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders. Certain substances in the environment can also cause phantom smells. These include tobacco smoke, certain types of chemicals (e.g., insecticides or solvents), or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer.\nA physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell (olfactory system) or taste (gustatory system), or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own. Sometimes this occurs step by step. The process can take several years. When a phantom smell is caused by an illness (e.g., sinusitis), it should go away with theillness. If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs."}

Once in a while it can be a sign of breast cancer. Newborn babies can have nipple discharge. This is because hormones from the mother cause milk to develop in the baby. This kind of discharge goes away in 2 weeks.\nHere are some of the reasons for nipple discharge:\nSome medications can cause nipple discharge. These medicines are opioids, oral contraceptives, antihypertensives (methyldopa, reserpine, verapamil), antidepressants and antipsychotics. A woman is more likely to have changes in her breasts as she gets older. Some of these changes can be the cause of nipple discharge.\nA doctor or nurse will often ask a woman to have a examination. Medical tests can find the reason for the nipple discharge. A mammogram and ultrasound are two tests that a doctor might use. The fluid that comes out of the nipple may be collected and tested.\nSometimes nipple discharge is treated with an operation. Even after surgery another operation may be needed. "}

On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and started a series of lectures on English law, the first of their kind. The lectures on law were massively successful. They earnt him a total of \u00a3453 (\u00a3) per year, and led to the publication of \"An Analysis of the Laws of England\" in 1756. This repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works.\nBlackstone was made the first Vinerian Professor of English Law. He published a very successful second book, titled \"A Discourse on the Study of the Law\". With his growing fame, Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice, also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761. In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", his most important work. When completed, the work earned Blackstone \u00a314,000 (\u00a3 in terms). After some failures, he got appointed to the judiciary as a judge until his death, on 14 February 1780."}

Before modern refrigeration was available, there was the pantry. The pantry was a room or large cupboard made to keep cooler than the temperature in the kitchen. Built on the north side of the house close to the kitchen, it had no windows, but had air ventilation. The walls were brick or wood. As the air in the pantry warmed, it rose, escaping through the upper vent. This in turn drew cooler air in from the lower vent, providing constant circulation of cooler air. \nIn the summertime, the temperatures in the pantry would be several degrees lower than the ambient temperature in the house. In wintertime, the temperature in the cold pantry would be considerably lower than that in the kitchen.\nA pantry was the place to keep foodstocks that did not need to be kept refrigerated. Remember, food was bought regularly in those days, and not stored for long. Breads, butter, cheesecakes, eggs, pastries, and pies were kept in a cold. Vegetables could be brought up from the cellar in smaller amounts and stored in the cold pantry until ready to use. The pantry was a place to store fresh berries and fruit, cheese, butter and such."}

They may be an extinct species or subspecies.\nThey were first discovered in in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. This cave has also been inhabited by Neanderthals and modern humans.\nA finger bone fragment of a juvenile female was discovered. She lived about 41,000 years ago, with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of Melanesians and aboriginal Australians and around 6% in Papuans deriving from Denisovans.\nThe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the finger bone showed it was genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. The nuclear genome from this specimen suggested that Denisovans shared a common origin with Neanderthals.\nDNA analysis has indicated that modern humans, Neanderthals, and the Denisova hominin last shared a common ancestor around years ago.\nThe mtDNA analysis also suggested that this species was the result of a migration out of Africa that came between a migration by \"Homo erectus\" individuals and later ones by some ancestors of most modern humans.\nFossils.\nSo far, the fossils of four distinct Denisovans from Denisova Cave have been identified through their DNA: Denisova 2, Denisova 3, Denisova 4, and Denisova 8. Denisova 2 and Denisova 3 are young females,and Denisova 4 and Denisova 8 are adult males.\nAnatomy.\nSo far, only a finger bone, a toe bone and two teeth are the only body parts that have been found.\u00a0 The finger bone is from a woman.\u00a0 It is broader than a human finger.\u00a0 This fact suggests that Denisovans were more robust than any modern humans.\nMitochondrial DNA analysis.\nThe mtDNA from the finger bone differs from that of modern humans by 385 nucleotides in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500. This\u00a0 is more than the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals, which is around 202 bases."}

Due to the track's unique layout, the race generates annual discussion, with media, fans and participants both in favor and against racing this event, Due to the speedway's layout, Road course ringers are common, A NASCAR term standing for drivers only on road course races.\nHistory.\nFrom 1989-1997, NASCAR had utilized the full , best known for sports car racing, Subtle changes to some of the turns accommodated the stock cars, and increased passing widths, Ricky Rudd won the inaugural race at Sonoma.\nIn the 1991 race, Sonoma became famous, With seven laps remaining in the race, Mark Martin tried to pass Tommy Kendall, who cut his tire, subbing for an injured Kyle Petty, The two made contact, resulting in Martin crashing and running into Davey Allison, cutting his tire. and the lead went to Davey Allison, Then with 2 laps to go, Ricky Rudd passed Allison for the lead, but spun out from contact in the final turn.\nRicky Rudd led the field to the white flag, and contended to win the race, his second victory at Sonoma, and to advance in championship standings, However, as he came around to take the win, Rudd was black-fagged just 3 feet from the finish line, Davey Allison was declared the winner and Rudd finished in second place.\nThe last Sonoma race was held at the previous road course passage was in 1997 on October 5 at a Truck Series event, There, Joe Ruffmann won the race but controversy erupted when Rich Bickle blamed a loss of top-ten finishes on rookie Boris Said, Rich Bickle cut down a tire, and in reply, Boris Said ran in to Bickle and waited for him to come around and crash him, NASCAR after a brief red flag for a massive crash in a wall of tires, disqualified Said and placed him $10,000 for his actions.\nIn 1998, the circuit for the event was shortened to a modified road course with the addition of the \"Chute\" from Turn 4 to Turn 7, bypassing Turn 5 and 6.\nIn 2001, the \"Chute\" was modified to such that the NASCAR circuit measured long.\n\"Gilligan's Island\".\nFrom 1989 to 2001, the pit road could modify up to 34 pit stalls, In the early years, some teams were required to share pit stalls, while the other teams were forced to pit inside the garage area.\nAfter a few years, A makeshift auxiliary pit road was constructed inside the hairpin (turn 11), nicknamed Gilligan's Island, Cars that had nine slowest qualifying speeds were relegated to the pit stalls, Pitting in this area was considered as an inconvenience and a competitive disadvantage, more so than the even the disadvantages one would experience pitting on the back straightaway at a short period of time.\nSince the length of the auxilary pit road, was significantly shorter than the other pit road, the cars that pitted were held from 15\u201320 seconds in order to make up for the time that would have been if the cars had traveled the entire pit road.\nPitting on Gilligan's Island had several other inconveniences, The location (the staging area for the drag races, was landlocked by the race course, and crew members were unable to leave once the race began, Teams sent the only pit crew to Gilligan's Island, and once they were there, they could not access the garage area or their transporters, to collect spare parts/tools, The only repairs that could be made were routine tire changes and refueling, as well as major repairs, If a team pitting on Gilligan's Island dropped out of the race, The crewman were unable to pack their supplies and prepare to leave (a common practice at other tracks) until the race was over.\nChanges to the track in 2002 that included separation of the drag strip from the frontstretch, removal of the main drag strip grandstand, and new control tower for road racing led to the pit road being expanded by extending pit road into the main straight and moving the pit exit up past turn 1, thereby expanding it to 43 cars, and Gilligan's Island was abandoned.\nTrophy.\nThe trophy was in form of wine bottle holder paired with a giant wine glass as a nod to NAPA County's wine country."}

As many as 11% of American women between 15 and 44 years-old may have this sickness. It is most common in women 30-40 years-old. Having endometriosis can make it hard to have a baby. Endometriosis can be treated by a doctor. Treating endometriosis may help a woman get pregnant.\nOther problems:\nA woman can have endometriosis for a long time. It can be very painful. Women with endometriosis can have problems with their menstrual flow. This sickness can be so painful that it affects many areas of life.\nEndometriosis is hard to find in some women. To find endometriosis in a woman a doctor may order many medical tests. These tests may be a pelvic exam and an ultrasound. When a woman has a pelvic exam the doctor will feel for lumps or scars. An ultrasound will help the doctor see cysts on the ovaries. The doctor may put a wand-shaped ultrasound probe into the vagina. A scanner may be used on your abdomen. Another test may be used. It is called an MRI. The MRI takes a picture of the inside of the body.\nA doctor may try to treat endometriosis with medicine. There are different kinds of medicine that treat endometriosis. Birth control medicine can help some women have less pain. Another kind of medicine is called Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. If the pain is less after taking medicine then the doctor may decide that the woman has endometriosis. If the woman stops taking the medicine the pain may come back.\nEndometriosis is treated with surgery on some women. This is called laparoscopy. The doctor doing the surgery can look inside the body to find endometriosis tissue. Surgery is the only way to be sure that a woman has endometriosis. The doctor may see endometriosis tissue during laparoscopy. A doctor may remove a sample and study it under the microscope to decide."}

It is sans-serif in a geometrical style. It was made in a huge range of weights and widths. Univers was based on a much earlier design of about 1898, called Akzidenz-Grotesk.\nUnivers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs. By creating a matched range of styles and weights, Univers allowed documents to be created in one consistent typeface for all text documents. This matched the desire among practitioners of the \"Swiss style\" of typography for neutral sans-serif typefaces avoiding artistic excesses. By \"excesses\" might be meant blackletter, which had been used earlier in German language publications. But Univers also leaves out all the styling of the classical Roman lettering, including the use of serifs at the end of letter strokes.\nOne important influence was the coming of modernism, with its rejection of tradition in favour of plain function. That is mentioned by most of the people who promoted Univers and other sans serif fonts.

It is the second in the \"Quatermass\" series by writer Nigel Kneale, and the oldest of those serials to survive in its entirety in the BBC archives.\nAlthough sometimes compared unfavourably to the first and third \"Quatermass\" serials, \"Quatermass II\" was praised for its allegorical concerns of the damaging effects of industrialisation and the corruption of governments by big business. It is described on the British Film Institute's \"Screenonline\" website as \"compulsive viewing.\"\nProduction.\nOn 22 September 1955 the ITV network was launched in the UK, bringing commercial television to Britain for the first time and ending the BBC's broadcasting monopoly in the country. The new network's creation had been established by the Television Act 1954, and the BBC had known in advance that they would need programmes to combat the new rival for television audiences. Referring to the 1953 science-fiction serial \"The Quatermass Experiment\" in a memo written in 1954, BBC Television's Controller of Programmes, Cecil McGivern, noted that: \"Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while [\"The Quatermass Experiment\"] lasted. We are going to need \"many\" more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes.\"\nCasting and crew.\nReginald Tate, who had played the title role in \"The Quatermass Experiment\", collapsed and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This was less than a month before the shooting of the location filming for \"Quatermass II\" began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.\nReception and influence.\nThe available British television audience had doubled since \"The Quatermass Experiment\" had been shown in 1953, and the viewing figures for \"Quatermass II\" were accordingly higher. The series gained an audience of 7.9 million viewers for its first three episodes, which rised to 8.3 million for the fourth and fifth and concluded with 9 million. A BBC audience research report commissioned after \"Quatermass II\" had finished found that 90% of those questioned in the sample had watched at least five episodes of the production.\nOther media.\nAs with \"The Quatermass Xperiment\", the film rights to the series were purchased by Hammer Film Productions \u2014 in this case after they had only read the scripts, before the series was even made. Titled \"Quatermass 2\", the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by Val Guest, with Brian Donlevy starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the screenplay himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title \"Enemy from Space\".\nIn April 2005 BBC Worldwide released a DVD box set of all their existing \"Quatermass\" material. This included digitally restored versions of all six episodes of \"Quatermass II\", with the sound and vision of the recordings cleaned up as far as possible, and some of the existing special effects inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.\nIn 2016 released \"Quatermass II\" and \"Quatermass and the Pit\"."}

Most asteroids will not hit Earth. Asteroid impact prediction works by finding the ones that will hit Earth. It finds asteroids that might hit Earth in the future. This works well for big asteroids as they can be seen easily from a long distance, many years before they come close to Earth. \nThere aren't many big asteroids, but there are millions of smaller space rocks. They are not normally bright enough to see until they are close to Earth. We use telescopes to find the asteroids that are going to hit Earth soon. The telescopes are not good enough to see the small asteroids unless everything is perfect. Because of this we almost never see them before they hit Earth.\nNASA Sentry system.\nThe IAU Minor Planet Center (MPC) looks after all the asteroid information in the world. NASA's Sentry System is always checking the MPC asteroid information. It checks if any asteroids could hit earth in the future. It has not yet found any. The asteroid which is most likely to hit Earth is called . NASA thinks it will pass Earth in September 2095. They think it has less than a 1 in 10 chance of hitting Earth.\nMaking impact prediction better.\nIn the early 21st century impact prediction usually doesn't work. Almost all of the asteroids that hit Earth are a surprise. NASA wants to get better at impact prediction by building more powerful telescopes. A big new telescope, made for searching, is being built in northern Chile called the LSST. It is very big and will take years to build. It should be ready by 2023. When it is ready the powerful telescope should be a lot better at seeing small asteroids. \nTelescopes on the Earth can only see part of the sky. They won't be able to see any asteroids coming from near the direction of the Sun because of the blue sky during the day. A telescope in space doesn't have that problem. It can see much more of the sky around Earth. It can keep looking all through the day and night and there are no clouds or rain in space. Telescopes in space can also use infrared heat radiation to find asteroids. Looking for that kind of light is an especially good way of finding asteroids. This method doesn't work on Earth because the air is too warm. Heat radiation from warm air hides the heat radiation that comes from the asteroids. Space telescopes are better in a lot of ways, but they cost more money. Also, they don't last as long as telescopes on the ground.\nIn 2017 NASA had lots of ideas to help find smaller asteroids. They want to find 9 out of 10 of the asteroids that are bigger than 140 metres (as long as two jumbo jets). The ideas should help find asteroids which are smaller than 140 metres long too. Quite a lot of the ideas use a new telescope on the ground working with a new space telescope. An example telescope on the ground is LSST. An example telescope in space is NEOCAM, but nobody has started building it. These new telescopes will be expensive. But, NASA has done most of the work finding asteroids already. Out of all the asteroids ever found, NASA has found more than 9 out of 10 of them. Asteroids hit all over Earth, not just the USA where NASA is from. Because of this, NASA was asked by the United States government to find other countries to help. They need other countries to help make the telescopes and help pay for them.\nList of when it worked.\nBelow is the list of all the times when asteroid impact prediction worked. When it worked, the space rocks which hit the Earth were not a surprise. There are lots of asteroids which will hit Earth in the future. They are not in the list because we don't know about any of them yet. If we get better at asteroid impact prediction we will find out about them. Then we will know what asteroids are going to hit us in the future."}

The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.\nOrigin of the word.\nThe term \"international\" was coined by the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham in his \"Introduction to Principles of Morals and Legislation\", which was printed for publication in 1780 and published in 1789. Bentham wrote: \"The word \"international\", it must be acknowledged, is a new one; though, it is hoped, sufficiently analogous and intelligible. It is calculated to express, in a more significant way, the branch of law which goes commonly under the name of the \"law of nations\". The word was adopted in French in 1801. Thomas Erskine Holland noted in his article on Bentham in the 11th edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" that \"Many of Bentham's phrases, such as 'international,' 'utilitarian,' 'codification,' are valuable additions to our language; but the majority of them, especially those of Greek derivation, have taken no root in it.\"\nMeaning in particular fields.\n\"International\" is also sometimes used as a synonym for \"global\"."}

This was also the first single to be credited to the group performing under the name ABBA.\nOn 6 April 1974 the song was the winning entry for Sweden in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. The victory began ABBA's path to worldwide fame. The Swedish version of the single was a double A-side with \"Honey, Honey\" (Swedish version), while the English version usually featured \"Watch Out\" on the B-side.\nThe single became a No.\u00a01 hit in several countries. It reached the U.S. Top 10 and went on to sell nearly six million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.\nAt the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005, it was chosen as the best song in the competition's history.\nAt Eurovision.\nThe band considered submitting another song to Eurovision, \"Hasta Ma\u00f1ana\", but decided on \"Waterloo\" since it gave equal weight to both lead vocalists Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, while \"Hasta Ma\u00f1ana\" was sung only by F\u00e4ltskog.\nABBA performed the song at Melodifestivalen 1974 in February, singing it in Swedish. The song won, and therefore advanced to Eurovision.\nThe song differed from the standard \"dramatic ballad\" tradition of the Eurovision Song Contest by its flavour and rhythm, as well as by its performance. ABBA gave the audience something that had more rarely been seen before in Eurovision: flashy costumes (including silver platform boots), plus a catchy uptempo song and even simple choreography. The group also broke from convention by being the first winning entry in a language other than that of their home country; prior to 1973 all Eurovision singers had been required to sing in their country's native tongue, a restriction that was lifted briefly for the contests between 1973 and 1976 contests (thus allowing \"Waterloo\" to be sung in English), then reinstated before ultimately being removed again in 1999. Compared to later ABBA releases, the singers' Swedish accents are decidedly more pronounced in \"Waterloo\".\nThe song won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 final on 6 April, beating runner-up Gigliola Cinquetti of Italy's entry \"S\u00ec\" by six points."}

He ran in the new Ward 16 Don Valley East. Before the 2018 election, the Government of Ontario made the number of councillors in the Toronto City Council smaller.

Unlike normal wide angle lenses, fisheye lernses use Gnomonic projection, which will distort the image. Straight lines which do not run through the center of the image will be shown as curved ones. Common fisheye lenses have angles of view between 180 and 220 degrees. Prototypes have been built with angles of view as large as 270 and even 310 degrees. Due to their construction, conventional wide angle lenses cannot reach angles of view greater than 180 degrees. Even though they have very wide angles of view, fisheye lenses show less vignetting. Vignetting occurs when the border of the image is much darker than the center. \nBecause of their wide angle of view, fisheye lenses are often used in cameras used for surveillance."}

It is an expression of democracy, that in some cases people and groups should be able to have their voice heard directly. The issues at stake may be of a local kind, or special to a particular group of people.\nA public inquiry differs from a Royal Commission. A public inquiry accepts evidence, conducts its hearings in public and deals with a specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may make oral or written submissions, and listen to oral evidence given by other parties.\nResearch on the effects of public inquiries suggests they may not do much to change people's minds. However, it is normal for a public enquiry to be about some controversy. That is the point of the exercise."}

In 2008, The speedway was sold to Bruton Smith, hoping that the track could hold a race by 2011 and after four years, the former speedway owners abandoned the lawsuit. In August 2010, NASCAR announced that the track could hold a Cup Series event in 2011. Seven months later, Royal Dutch Shell's Quaker State brand was announced to sponsor the 267-lap race held on July 9, 2011, and was won by Kyle Busch. The race was plagued by a massive traffic problem where many of the fans were expected to attend the race were turned away after several hours on Interstate 71. Following the problem, Kentucky Speedway announced that they bought more land for parking and began to work with the state government to improve the track around the speedway in time for the 2012 race.\nNew aero package for 2015.\nOn June 16, 2015, NASCAR announced a new aero package would be used for the 2015 race. The changes include a smaller rear spoiler and other adjustments that significantly reduced aerodynamic downforce. The spoiler was decreased to tall, There was also a wide splitter extension. In addition, Tires supplied to Goodyear provided drivers with more grip. \"We want to see more load changes on the racetrack\", NASCAR Executive Vice-President and Chief Racing Development Officer Steve O'Donnell said in a media teleconference, \"We will evaluate and a number of factors coming out of Kentucky, and see what we can learn and implement down the road\". Originally, the package was to be used at last year's All Star Race, but the plan was scrubbed and NASCAR opted to use the package for a points race. \"Let me be clear. This is not a test, this is a race\" O'Donnell said of the rules package will be in effect for the 18th round of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. \"We had an extensive testing plan with this industry over the past 18 months. We couldn't implement this if we didn't feel confident as an industry to implement it at Kentucky.\nTrophy.\nSince 2015, the race trophy has been in the form of a Crosley jukebox."}

Growing up in wealth, he always appreciated that the best things and was flamboyant especially in comparison to other gruff, working class of the drivers like Dale Earnhardt, Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough. Richmond had expensive tastes in food and drink and lived a fast lifestyle that mirrored his on-track preferences.\nHe continued to the open-wheel circuits, racing in the 1980 Indianapolis 500 finishing ninth, He decided to move on into stock-car racing in NASCAR, where he spent the rest of his days. His first few seasons, He bounced from team to team looking for a permanent ride, which he found 1982, He raced in 26 events, winning twice and finishing in the top 5 seven times, but only finished 26th in Winston Cup standings.\nHowever, at the tail end of the 1986 season, Richmond was feeling noticeably ill, Following the season, he checked into a clinic and discovered that he had AIDS, and which at the time, was a little understood disease, Despite his illness, Richmond worked to regain his strength and in 1987, He returned in midseason and subsequently won two races at Pocono and Riverside. However, his health started deteriorating and so did his results, Richmond would race in six more events before being told not to race by NASCAR. \nIn 1988, Richmond tried to make another run with NASCAR, but NASCAR was only concerned about Richmond's health, but also about he contracted AIDS in the first place, They subjected Richmond (and Richmond alone) to a drug test, and several days later, NASCAR announced that he was suspended indefinitely for testing positive for banned substances. Richmond was livid saying that he did not take any banned substances and demanded another test, which he passed. NASCAR later admitted that the only two substances found was Sudafed and Advil. They also released the permanent ban, but refused to allow Richmond to drive again until he surrendered his medical records that said he had AIDS.\nTim Richmond finally retired to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he lived in seclusion with his mother until his death on August 13, 1989. \nIn recent years, NASCAR has suspended drivers with drug violations, Busch Series driver Shane Hmiel was suspended twice (2003 and 2005), before he was suspended for life in 2006, while Kevin Grubb was also suspended for failing a drug test, and Craftsman Truck Series driver Brian Rose was also suspended in 2003 for failing a drug test. Many continue to point the incident with Richmond, to show that an extremely \"good ol' boy\" system is still in place with NASCAR. \nIn the movie, Days of Thunder was loosely based on Richmond's life, with Tom Cruise's character (Cole Trickle), inspired by Richmond, while Robert Duvall's (Harry Hogge) inspired by crew chief Harry Hyde, and Randy Quaid's (Tim Daland), inspired by owner Rick Hendrick. \nOther info.\nRichmond was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2002."}

It has 2 million members. This makes it the second-largest Lutheran group in the country. The LCMS was organized in 1847 at a meeting in Chicago, Illinois. At first it was called the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States ().\nThe LCMS has congregations in all 50 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. More than half of its members are located in the Midwest. It is a member of the International Lutheran Council. The LCMS's headquarters are in Kirkwood, Missouri.\nThe current president has been Matthew C. Harrison since September 1, 2010.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Missouri Synod was started by several communities of German Lutherans in the United States. F. C. D. Wyneken did mission work in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. Martin Stephan started a community of Lutherans in Perry County, Missouri, and St. Louis, Missouri. Wilhelm L\u00f6he sent missionaries to Michigan and Ohio.\nThe Saxon immigration.\nIn the Kingdom of Saxony in the 19th century, Lutheran pastor Martin Stephan and many of his followers thought that their church would be forced to merge with the Reformed church. Because of this, Stephan and between 600 and 700 other Saxon Lutherans left Germany to move to the United States in November 1838. They had five ships.\nTheir ships arrived between December 31, 1838, and January 20, 1839, in New Orleans. One ship was lost at sea. Afterwards, they settled in Perry County, Missouri. At first, Stephan was the bishop. Later, other members said that Stephan was corrupt and a fornicator, so he was kicked out. This made C. F. W. Walther the new leader.\nThe L\u00f6he missionaries.\nIn 1842, a German pastor named Wilhelm L\u00f6he started sending missionaries to America. They started congregations in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.\nFounding and early years.\nIn 1844 and 1845, the three groups listed above (the Saxons, the L\u00f6he missionaries, and Wyneken) started talking about starting a synod. On April 26, 1847, twelve pastors met in Chicago, Illinois, and officially started the \"German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio and Other States\". Walther was the first president.\nThe synod was conservative. L\u00f6he left because he disagreed with some of its doctrine.\nThe Synodical Conference.\nIn 1857 and 1872, the LCMS entered into fellowship with five other conservative Lutheran synods. These groups formed the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America.\nEnglish transition.\nFor the thirty years after it started, the Missouri Synod focused on German-speaking Lutherans. In 1872, members of the Missouri Synod, along with three other synods, started the \"English Evangelical Lutheran Conference of Missouri\". This group focused on English-speakers. It became an independent synod in 1888 and merged with the LCMS in 1911.\nEnglish became more common in the LCMS during the first two decades of the 20th century. Some churched dropped all German services.\nPost-WWII.\nIn 1947, the synod shortened its name to \"The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod\". In 1964, the National Evangelical Lutheran Church, an historically Finnish-American Lutheran church, merged with the LCMS. In 1971, the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, an historically Slovak-American church, merged with the LCMS.\nThe Synodical Conference broke up in 1963. Six years later, the LCMS formed the Lutheran Council in the United States of America (LCUSA) with several other Lutheran synods. These were moderate and liberal. Afterwards, the LCMS started becoming more conservative again.\nSome of the more liberal professors and students left Concordia Seminary and started Seminex. In 1976, about 250 of the more liberal congregations left the Synod. Then the LCMS left the LCUSA.\nForeign missions.\nIn the early 20th century, the LCMS sent missionaries to Brazil and Argentina. The Brazil District and the Argentina District were started, which at first were part of the LCMS. In the 1980s, they became independent synods.\nThe LCMS had congregations in Canada. In 1988, the Canadian congregations became an independent synod, the Lutheran Church-Canada. A small number of churches in Ontario and Quebec are still in the LCMS.\nBeliefs.\nThe Missouri Synod believes that the Bible is the first source for the teachings of the church, and that the Bible is best explained by the Book of Concord. The Missouri Synod also teaches biblical inerrancy, which is the teaching that the Bible does not have errors. \nThe Missouri Synod believes that justification comes from God \"by divine grace alone, through faith alone, on account of Christ alone.\" It teaches that faith in Jesus is the only way to eternal salvation. God gives people grace through the Word of God and the Sacraments. The synod does not have an official definition of sacrament. This means that some Missouri Synod Lutherans may disagree about how many sacraments there are. All agree that Baptism and Communion are sacraments.\nIn the LCMS, babies are baptized, as well as children and adults.\nThe LCMS teaches that the body and blood of Jesus are truly present in the Eucharist. The synod practices closed communion. This mean that normally, only confirmed members of an LCMS church (or a church that has fellowship with the LCMS) can participate in communion at an LCMS church.\nThe LCMS supports creationism.\nPastors.\nLCMS pastors are usually required to have a four-year bachelor's degree (in any discipline), as well as a four-year Master of Divinity degree. The latter degree can be earned from one of these institutions: Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana or at the two seminaries run by the Lutheran Church\u2013Canada. After they receive this degree, pastors are called to a church and are ordained.\nThe LCMS does not let women be pastors.\nChurch structure.\nThe LCMS is led by a synod president, who must have been ordained. He is elected by synod members at a synodical convention. This convention is held every three years. The current president is Rev. Dr. Matthew C. Harrison.\nDistricts.\nThe entire synod is divided into 35 districts, usually representing a specific geographic area. There are two non-geographic districts (the English District and the SELC District). The English District and the SELC District used to be their own synods, but they merged with the LCMS.\nEach district is led by an elected district president, who must have been ordained. The districts are subdivided into circuits. Each circuit is led by a circuit visitor, who must be a pastor at one of the local churches.\nRelationship with other Lutheran bodies.\nThe LCMS is a member of the International Lutheran Council. It also has fellowship with the American Association of Lutheran Churches (AALC)."}

{"id": "655204", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=655204", "title": "Vinicius and Tom", "text": "Vinicius is the mascot of the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Tom is the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The mascots represent Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Vinicius represents Brazilian animals, and his body has parts of cats, monkeys, and birds. Tom represents Brazilian plant life.\nA Brazilian company called Birdo made the mascots. The Olympic organizers only wanted mascots made by Brazilian companies. The organizers chose Birdo's mascots in August 2013, and they showed them to the public on 23 November 2014, but the mascots did not have names yet at that time. The organizers asked the public to choose names for them. The public chose to name the mascots after Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim. Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim wrote the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\".\nThe Olympic organizers made a children's television series about the mascots. The Rio organizers also made many toys and other merchandise of the mascots. The organizers gave wrestling coaches soft dolls of Vinicius. If the coaches did not like a referee's call, then they would throw the doll into the ring. Many people thought that this was funny. Paralympic medalists got special dolls of Tom. They were special because the leaves on Tom's head were the same color as their medals. Some observers liked how the mascots looked. Others thought they looked strange.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe organizers of the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio 2016) started to ask for mascot designs in November 2012. The events were going to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, so the Olympic organizers only wanted designs from Brazilian companies. Directors from the Brazilian film festival Anima Mundi helped the Rio 2016 organizers choose the mascots.\nAfter looking at the designs, the Rio 2016 organizers chose three of them and asked children to help them choose the final mascot. The children were six to twelve years old and were from either Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo. The organizers gave the three designs to the children, but they did not tell the children that they were for the Olympics. The organizers only told the kids about the mascots' personalities. The children responded with comments such as \"'This is my friend', 'This one seems stuck-up', 'This one has cool hair'; and 'That one looks silly'\". The organizers used the children's comments to make the mascot designs better.\nA group of judges chose the final mascots in August 2013. The group included members of the Rio 2016 organizers, the International Olympic Committee, the Brazilian Olympic Committee, and the Brazilian Paralympic Committee, and people who worked in animation, illustration, advertising and market research. All of the judges agreed to choose a set of two mascots, one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games. A S\u00e3o Paulo-based animation company named Birdo created these mascots. Birdo and the organizers began to create content featuring the mascots, working in secrecy.\nNaming and unveiling.\nThe organizers showed the public the mascots on 23 November 2014, but they had not yet decided what to name them. On 24 November 2014, the mascots appeared publicly in costumes for the first time at the Gin\u00e1sio Experimental Ol\u00edmpico Juan Antonio Samaranch, a school for talented young athletes in Rio. The organizers let the public pick the names of the mascots in an online vote. There were three candidates in the vote:\nThe voting ended after three weeks on 14 December 2014. \"Vinicius and Tom\" won with 44 percent of 323,327 votes.\nUse of Vinicius in Olympic wrestling events.\nIn the sport of wrestling, coaches may challenge a referee's call by throwing a \"soft object\" into the ring. This is normally a foam brick, but wrestling rules do not exactly say what the soft object must be. The Rio 2016 organizers gave wrestling coaches soft plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a call. One wrestler's coach got a Vinicius doll with a red shirt, while the opponent's coach got one with a blue shirt.\nMany people thought this was funny. NBC Sports commentators started to call Vinicius \"the challenge mascot\". Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website \"Thrillist\", wrote that the mascot took \"a little of the anger out of a challenge\". Jason Bryant, the official commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was surprised to see this at the Olympics because there is a lot of emphasis on \"protocol\" at the Olympics. However, Byrant eventually said that it does not matter what the challenge object is if it has cultural importance to the location of the competition. Coach Mike Malinconico argued that the Olympic organizers should not have done this.\nCharacteristics.\nVinicius is the Olympic mascot, and he is named after Brazilian musician Vinicius de Moraes. Vinicius's design represents Brazilian wildlife. The design combines \"the agility of cats, sway of monkeys and grace of birds.\" Vinicius can stretch his arms and legs as long as he wants. His mission is \"to spread joy throughout the world and celebrate the friendship that flourishes between people from all over the world\" at the Olympic Games.\nTom is the Paralympic mascot, and is he named after Brazilian musician Tom Jobim. Tom's design represents the plants of Brazilian forests. Tom can pull any object out of his head. His mission is \"to inspire everybody to use creativity and determination to always reach further and have fun.\"\nVinicius and Tom \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians\" after the International Olympic Committee chose Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The mascots are named after Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim, who co-wrote the 1962 bossa nova song \"The Girl from Ipanema\".\nMedia.\nAnimated shorts.\nOn 5 August 2015, Cartoon Network Brazil started to broadcast animated short films with the mascots. The series is named \"Vinicius e Tom \u2013 Divertidos por Natureza\" (\"Vinicius and Tom \u2013 Fun by Nature\" or \"Vinicius and Tom \u2013 Natural Entertainers\"). The series has 32 episodes. Each episode is two minutes long. \"Divertidos por Natureza\" is the third television cartoon series based on Olympic mascots. It is also the first cartoon created in the Americas based on Olympic mascots. The show follows Vinicius and Tom as they live in Brazilian forests and cities. The mascots are also sometimes joined by the \"Carioca Sisters\" (). The sisters are named Bela, Sol, and Vida.\nThe series is designed to promote the mascots. Turner Broadcasting System, the owner of Cartoon Network, spent US$750,000 to develop the series. Cartoon Network helped to coproduce the series because it won a competition held by the Rio 2016 organizers to select a collaborator for the series. Brand director Beth Lula said that the mascots \"are one of the principal methods of engaging the public with the Games. The cartoon will give them life, reinforcing the emotional link of the public with the event.\" The series is targeted towards children, but the show's staff said that adults will like it too too.\nMerchandise.\nThe mascots were included among the merchandise of the Rio 2016 Games. Merchandise items ranged in size from a Lego kit to life-size dolls. The organizers gave Paralympic medalists stuffed toys of Tom. They colored the leaves on the dolls' heads in gold, silver, or bronze in order to match with their medals. The Vinicius and Tom Lego kit is the first time that Lego made a commercial version of Olympic mascots. An employee at a Rio 2016 merchandise store said that the mascots were \"the most popular thing by far. ... Kids and adults all love them, especially Vinicius, he is the favourite.\"\nThe Rio 2016 Organizing Committee thought that the mascots could make up a quarter of merchandise sales in Rio. Overall, merchandise sales were 11 percent higher than what they thought, according to Rio 2016 spokesperson Mario Andrada. The best-selling item was a hat in the shape of Vinicius's head. The second-best-selling item was a pair of Havaianas with a drawing of Vinicius on it.\nReception.\nJulia Glum wrote about Vinicius and Tom in an article in the \"International Business Times.\" She said that the \"mascot for the Olympic Games is almost always strange-looking, and Rio de Janeiro is no exception. ... though they're by far not the craziest Olympic animals to ever exist ...\" In an article published by \"Mic\", Brianna Provenzano called the mascots \"lovable\". She described their appearance as \"sweet and simple\", and she highlighted their symbolisms for the animals and plants of Brazil. On the other hand, Charlotte Wilder wrote an article in \"USA Today\"s sports column \"For The Win.\" She said that she was unimpressed by Vinicius's design: \"Whoever was in charge of coming up with this creature of the huge hands and feet did exactly what it looks like, which is mash up a bunch of animals, video game characters, and cartoons, stuff it with some synthetic filling, and call it day.\" Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, thought that Rio 2016 should have given more attention to environmental protection by using actual animal species instead of inventing their own animal. Young also thought that the organizers should have included a female name in the public vote.\nCarlos Merigo wrote on Brazilian website \"B9\" that the mascots bring back \"the colorful, loving and fun atmosphere that marked the Olympic mascots over the decades\". Merigo called them a \"return to origins\" following the \"shapelessness\" of Wenlock and Mandeville, the mascots of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Neha Prakash wrote an article on digital media website \"Mashable\". Prakash said that Vinicius and Tom \"are more nostalgia-inducing than nightmarish\" compared to the \"terror\" of the mascots of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Many people compared the art style of the mascots to that of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" franchise. Stephen Wood wrote an article on the history of Olympic mascots in \"Paste\", and he compared them to the style of \"Adventure Time\", an American animated television series. In an article published on \"Slate\"'s culture blog \"Brow Beat\", Matthew Dessem wrote that there were no big problems with the mascots when compared to previous Olympic mascots: \"Like the best Olympic mascots of yore, Vinicius and Tom are well-suited to plush toys and licensing deals and will be completely forgotten within a year.\" Leila Cobo wrote an article published by \"Billboard\", and she praised the organizers of Rio 2016 for \"celebrating music in a most joyful and profound way\" by naming the Olympic mascot after Vinicius de Moraes."}

In most places, St John Ambulance are mostly volunteers and their role is to provide first aid at local events (e.g. sports matches, local fairs, races, etc.) and first aid training to the public.\nSt John Ambulance is run by its founders, the Venerable Order of Saint John. The Order is a descendant of the Knights Hospitaller of the Middle Ages. They founded the first branch of St John Ambulance in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. In 1877, the St John Ambulance Association was set up to teach first aid skills. In 1887, the St John Ambulance Brigade was founded to provide first aid at local events. These two have since been merged into the English branch of St John Ambulance.\nFirst aiders for St John Ambulance are often seen wearing uniform. They originally had army ranks, though many now use non-military ranks instead. Some branches have cadets, for teenagers and older children.\nAll branches of St John Ambulance use the eight-point Maltese Cross as their logo. This symbol appears on a number of organizations descended from the Knights Hospitaller. The Order of Malta Ambulance Corps in Ireland is an example. Other similar organizations include Red Cross and Red Crescent (a worldwide movement) and St Andrew's First Aid in Scotland."}

At this point the river runs generally west, but in a meandering course with a number of oxbows, and about 100km from its mouth it gradually widens, to over 10km wide where it meets the sea.\nNear the mouth of the river, near Juffure, is Kunta Kinteh Island, a place used in the slave trade which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe aquatic fauna in the Gambia River basin is closely associated with that of the Senegal River basin, and the two are usually combined under a single ecoregion known as the Senegal-Gambia Catchments. Although the species richness is moderately high, only three species of frogs and one fish are endemic to this ecoregion.\nOysters are harvested from the River Gambia and used to make oyster stew, a traditional dish in the cuisine of Gambia.\nThe river is an important trade route.

It was made as a way to write Mandarin using tonal spelling, or spelling rules that would change the syllable's spelling depending on its tone. For example, the syllable \"chai\" would be written as \"chai\" if it has the first Mandarin tone (or \"ch\u0101i\" in Pinyin), \"chair\" if it has the second tone (\"ch\u00e1i\")\", chae\" if it has the third tone (\"ch\u0103i\")\",\" and \"chay\" if it had the fourth tone (ch\u00e0i). Y.R. Chao created GR in order to increase literacy in China because China's illiteracy was very high in the early 20th century. He made it that tones could be written without extra tone markers, which can be long and difficult to add when printing. \nEven though many other Asian languages use tonal spelling, like Hmong, they all represent tones by using the same letter each time the tone is used. In Hmong, for example, \"-b is always\" a high tone, \"-s\" is always a low tone, \"-j\" is always high-falling tone. In GR, however, each syllable final has its own spelling rules, and many exceptions exist within these rules. For example, first tone words with the final \"-a\" as in \"b\u0101\" is written with just one vowel like \"ba\", except when the syllable begins with an \"l-, m-,\" or \"n-\", which then must be written as \"lha, mha,\" and \"nha\" in that order. This is only one of its many rules and exceptions. \nUnsurprisingly, many people thought GR was too difficult to learn. Nonetheless, it still has many supporters, and they would rather learn using GR than Pinyin. While supporters of GR claim that it helps users of GR remember tones better than people who just use Pinyin, studies have not supported this claim. As a matter of fact, one study showed that after one year, the subjects who learned Chinese using Pinyin could more accurately speak Mandarin with tones than those who learned using GR. \nAfter the Communist Party took over China, it tried to replaced all romanizations of Chinese, including GR, with Pinyin. While GR is not an official romanization in Taiwan, it can be seen in several places, including road signs, people's names, and the names of products, even though Hanyu Pinyin is the official romanization of Taiwan. \nEven though almost all romanizations in mainland China today are in Pinyin, there are still some exceptions. For example, the name of the province Shaanxi is written in GR rather than in Pinyin, which would be Sh\u01cenx\u012b with tone markers, because there is already another province named Shanxi, which is written as Sh\u0101nx\u012b with tones. If the Pinyin names were to be written without tone markers (which they often are in everyday Pinyin), they should both be spelled Shanxi. Therefore they would be impossible to tell apart using just Pinyin without tones. Therefore, an exception has been made in this case. \nBelow are examples of sentences written in Chinese characters, Pinyin, and GR with English translations. "}

He played for the Montreal Expos (1996\u20132003), Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2004\u201309), Texas Rangers (2010), and Baltimore Orioles (2011).\nGuerrero is considered one of the greatest batters of all time, and is widely regarded as the best \"bad ball\" batter of all time (the ability to hit pitches outside of the strike zone). He was well known for putting the ball into play, and particularly on the first pitch. He had exceptional hands at the plate, and would bat without batting gloves. Guerrero was able to hit for both power and average. In the outfield, Guerrero was sometimes considered a defensive liability, prone to making errors, which resulted in him being a designated hitter in the last stage of his remarkable career, but he was also known to have a very powerful throwing arm that allowed him to make outfield assists on base runners.\nMany baseball fans and critics believe Guerrero's career was overshadowed by those of other players due to playing for a small fan base in Montreal, and similarly, many believe that he deserved to win the 2000 National League Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award for his remarkable season, an award which instead was won by Barry Bonds.\nGuerrero barely missed being elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot (first year of candidacy), but he was admitted in on the second ballot.\nOne of Guerrero's sons, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., plays in MLB."}

Many different plants do this in several different plant families.\nThe advantage of hyperaccumulation of metals may be that the toxic levels of heavy metals in leaves deter herbivores (defence against herbivory).\nSeveral gene families are involved in hyperaccumulation including absorbing and storing heavy metals. The genes most usually involved are the ZIP gene family. These genes code for membrane receptors for the transport of, for example, zinc molecules.\nThese hyperaccumulation genes (HA genes) are found in over 450 plant species, including the model organisms \"Arabidopsis\" and the Brassicaceae. Expression of HA genes allows the plant to uptake and sequester metals such as As, Co, Fe, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ni in 100\u20131000 times the concentration found in sister species or populations."}

They represent the interests of all pupils and are in contact with the principal (monthly conversations). Also, they tell teachers about the students\u2019 requests and complaints and try to solve problems. The head of the student council is automatically a member of the student council and convenes their meetings. They are also the leader of these meetings. The head of the student council is responsible for the spreading of information and they have to put the decisions of the student council into practice. But they can also put their own ideas, which they have suggested in their election program, into reality.\nStudent council.\nThey student council has to show an interest in the opinions and the suggestions pupils have for the improvement of the school.\nThis means that the student representatives work for the interests of the students and bring them to the school management. Specifically, the student representatives have a right to be heard by the school management if the pupils have any concerns. These concerns may include suggestions for improvement in classroom teaching, conflicts with the teaching staff or organizational issues, or any other concerns. The student representatives should take care that not every issue has to be reported directly to the school management. Many problems can also be solved by talking directly to the participants.\nAnother important task of the student representation is to form working groups and to take over the planning of school projects. For example, if student representatives decide to collect money for an improvement at school, they may set up a committee to organize a sponsorship run or a charity concert.\nElections.\nEvery student council has a head with mostly two pupils. Every year pupils can volunteer to stand for election. They have to present their election program. In the election program the candidates present their goals for the school year to the other pupils. All pupils take part in the election and elect the new head of the student council.\nThe other part of the student council are the class speakers. They are elected by their class mates. All class speakers are automatically in the student council.\nStudent councils in different countries.\nGermany:\nIn German schools the student council represents the students and their ideas and wishes.\nThey plan school events and their election is a must.\nNorway: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nAll schools in Norway have to have a student council by law.\nThe purpose of the student council is to improve their school by encouraging social and cultural events and also events outside of school. The student councils are governed by a management which is either elected directly or by the student council.\nIreland:\nSince 1998 in Ireland there has been constant evolution of student councils in primary schools. Schools and staff assist the creation of the student council.\nFinland:\nSecondary high schools and vocational schools in Finland have student councils. They include all the students of the institution, but their status is not very important. The act demands that they should be heard in all matters connected to the education in the institution, but this is often not done.\nSpain:\nMost Spanish universities have student councils which are regulated by law, however schools don\u2019t have any. Some of the basic points are the 24% of student representation in the board. The council is elected by universal assent of the students.\nUnited Kingdom:\nIn Wales a student council, often called different names, is required in every kind of school. The Council has to meet regularly. The head of the students is elected by the students.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"}
