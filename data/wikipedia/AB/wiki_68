Seven officers were placed on leave as a result of the shooting. Brown died one day after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd, and his death happened near the time of other notable police killings including the deaths of Daunte Wright, Ma'Khia Bryant, and Adam Toledo in the United States.\nBackground.\nBrown had two outstanding warrants in Dare County \"on drug-related charges including possession with intent to sell cocaine.\"\nIncident.\nPasquotank County Sheriff Tommy Wooten II said that \"deputies from his department including a tactical team were attempting to perform search and arrest warrants on illegal distribution of cocaine, methamphetamine, crack cocaine and heroin when Brown was shot.\" Brown's death certificate states that Brown died from being shot in the head.\nAftermath.\nSeven sheriff's deputies were placed on administrative leave as a result of the shooting. Within a week of the killing, two other deputies resigned and one other deputy retired; this was not related to the killing, stated a member of the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office.\nElizabeth City declared a state of emergency in preparation of the release of the body cam footage to the public. Pasquotank County Attorney Michael Cox said faces in the video were being blurred. On the sixth day of marches in the city, protesters shut down the bridge over the Pasquotank River between Elizabeth City and Camden County. An hour later, the bridge was reopened to traffic. Elizabeth City mayor, Bettie Parker, declared a state of emergency before the full release of the body cam footage that led up to the shooting.\nOn April 26, Brown's family and their lawyers were allowed by Pasquotank County to watch a short bodycam video of the shooting. Family lawyer Chantel Cherry-Lassiter said that the video of 20 seconds showed the deputies shooting at Brown when he sat in his vehicle with his hands on the steering wheel. Cherry-Lassiter said Brown then drove away, while the deputies continued shooting at him, with Brown ultimately crashing the vehicle into a nearby tree. Cherry-Lassiter also said the deputies continued shooting after the crash.\nThe FBI announced on April 27 that it would be launching a civil rights probe into Brown's death. An agency spokesman stated, \"Agents will work closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina and the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice to determine whether federal laws were violated.\"\nReactions.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated \"Obviously, the loss of life is a tragedy and obviously we're thinking of the family members and the community\" and that President Biden was aware of the situation. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, as well as the family of Brown, immediately called for the bodycam footage to be released. People protested an emergency meeting of the Elizabeth City council with signs reading \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Stop killing unarmed Black Men.\"\nOn Twitter, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper wrote, \"Initial reports of the shooting in Elizabeth City and death of Andrew Brown, Jr. this week are tragic and extremely concerning. The body camera footage should be made public as quickly as possible and the SBI should investigate thoroughly to ensure accountability.\""}

It was much eaten, and thought to be one of the best-tasting fish. \nIts life style is rather similar to the salmon. The adults live in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, but come up rivers to breed. They have vanished from the dinner table because the Victorians build weirs in the Severn which stopped the fish getting to their breeding grounds The Severn, in SW England, is vital to the fish. It is by far the largest river opening in that part of the Atlantic. Overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction have also helped the shad's decline.\nNow, ways round the weirs are being built, so the fish can once again reach its ancestral breeding grounds."}

The male frog sits 1 to 2 meters off the ground on a plant and sings for the females. They do this near temporary bodies of water, for example flooded fields. They do this most on the third day after a big rain. The eggs float on the water or stick to plants.\nThe scientific name \"phlebodes\" comes from the Greek word \"phlebos\" for \"vein,\" from the colored markings on the frog's back."}

Wright drove away in his vehicle, making it a few blocks away before colliding with another vehicle. Officers administered CPR, but Wright was subsequently declared dead at the scene. A female passenger in the vehicle, Wright's girlfriend, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.\nProtests and violence.\nFollowing the shooting, mourners and protesters gathered near the scene, demanding justice for Wright. Police with riot control equipment attempted to restrain the crowd of several hundred people outside of a police precinct. Some in the crowd became unruly, hurling projectiles such as rocks at officers. There was also looting and arson, as more than 20 businesses were damaged in the riot, and police vehicles were vandalized as well.\nResponse.\nBrooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott issued a city-wide curfew until 6:00 a.m. the following morning and local schools were closed, with students instead attending virtually. The National Guard was activated to assist with dispelling the violence."}

It is caused by lossy compression. Lossy data compression removes some of the media's data. This way the data becomes small enough to be stored in the desired disk or transmitted inside the available bandwidth. If the compressor cannot store enough data in the compressed form, the result is a loss of quality, or introduction of artifacts.\nThe most common digital compression artifacts are DCT blocks. This is caused by the discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression algorithm used in many digital media, such as JPEG image compression, MP3 digital audio, and MPEG video coding formats. \nThese compression artifacts appear when heavy compression is applied. It occurs often in common digital media, such as DVDs, common computer file formats such as JPEG, MP3 and MPEG files. It also occurs in some other alternatives to the compact disc like the as Sony's MiniDisc format. Uncompressed media (such as on Laserdiscs and WAV files) or losslessly compressed media (such as FLAC or PNG) do not suffer from compression artifacts."}

Nietzsche thought that the moral values of the Catholic Church were outdated. For him, an \"\u00dcbermensch\" is one that is able to develop moral values which are not based on religion, but rather, rooted in Nihilism. When Nietsche used the term, he took most of the ideas from the French philosopher Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius. Helvetius used the term \"homme sup\u00e9rieur.\"\nThe idea itself is much older: Dionysius of Halicarnassus talked about a \"hyperanthropos\" (hyper: above, \"anthropos\": human) in the first century BC. He lived c. 60 \u2013 after 7 BC) and was a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric.\nLucian used the term, to talk about noblemen, who would be \"cut back to their real size\" in the realm of the dead. In his Divine Comedy, Dante used the hapax legomenon \"transhumana\"r to refer to the \u00dcbermensch. Transhumanar is a verb.

It can be translated as sub-human or under-human. Nietzsche, and others developed the term \u00dcbermensch, to refer to someone who has outgrown himself, and who no longer has all the problems ordinary people have For the Nazis, the \u00dcbermensch was someone of Aryan descent. The Untermensch, on the other hand was used for all the people of the races seen as inferior, such as the Jews, the Slavic people, gypsies or black people. \nWhen the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, Heinrich Himmler published a booklet, called \"Der Untermensch\". This brochure was distributed in Germany: it was made to increase the hatred towards the people of the Soviet Union (note: not the Slavic people, the term Slavic people never occurs in the brochure). The booklet was very popular, also with the German allies, such as the people in Croatia, Slovakia or Bulgaria. These people received copies in their own language. The booklet didn't provide much information about the Soviet union, it was mainly used to race hatred. Some people in the Nazi government were against the publication of the booklet: they thought they could convince the common people of the Soviet Union to fight against the Bolsheviks in power. During 1942, the publication of the booklet was stopped.\nIn 1924, Fritz Lang published his movie \"Die Nibelungen\", where he shows that the smith Mime (also called Mimir) as an Untermensch. During the Wochenschau, the Nazis showed several movies with Russian people in simple wooden houses, travelling on badly maintained roads. This was done to show the German people how inferior the people of the Soviet Union were. Needless to say: these clips also were propaganda. \nMovies that were made after the second world war, also show the concept of Untermensch: Louis de Fun\u00e8s has a few of these movies: In his movies, the term is not used for people of other nations seen as inferior, but rather: for people of the own nations, who have character traits that are seen as bad.\nDuring the Second World War, Japan expanded to China and in Southeast Asia. During that time, prisoners of war and civilians were used for experiments on humans. Unit 731 became known for experiments with chemiclal agents and pathogens, such as those causingthe plague, or smallpox. They also did experiments with poison gas. In Japanese, the people were called \"maruta,\" which can be translated as wood, or material. This a similar value judgement than that of Untermensch."}

The first budget shutdown ended after Congress passed a temporary budget bill, but the government shut down again after Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on a long-term budget bill. The second shutdown ended with congressional Republicans accepting Clinton's budget proposal. The first of the two shutdowns caused the furlough of about 800,000 workers, while the second caused about 284,000 workers to be furloughed.\nEffect.\nPolling generally showed that most respondents blamed congressional Republicans for the shutdowns, and Clinton's handling of the shutdowns helped his successful campaign in the 1996 presidential election.

It is commonly used to build roads, parking lots, airports, and embankment dams. Asphalt mixtures have been used in making pavements since the beginning of the twentieth century. It is made up of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt. The process was made by Edward De Smedt.\nAsphalt mixtures.\nMixing of asphalt and aggregate is done in one of several ways:\nHot-mix asphalt concrete (commonly abbreviated as HMA).\nThis is made by heating the asphalt binder to make it less viscous, and drying the aggregate to remove moisture from it before mixing it. Mixing is done at about 300 \u00b0F (roughly 150 \u00b0C) for virgin asphalt and 330 \u00b0F (166 \u00b0C) for polymer modified asphalt, and the asphalt cement at 200 \u00b0F (95 \u00b0C). HMA is used on roads with lots of traffic.\nWarm-mix asphalt concrete (commonly abbreviated as WMA).\nThis is made by adding either zeolites, waxes, asphalt emulsions, or sometimes even water to the asphalt binder before mixing. It is good for the environment because small amounts of fossil fuels are used to make them. It also releases less carbon dioxide into the air. In 2012, a survey of producers that made asphalt in the US found that nearly 25% of asphalt made was warm mix.\nCold-mix asphalt concrete.\nThis is made by emulsifying the asphalt in water. It is done with an emulsifying agent before mixing. While it is emulsified, the asphalt is less viscous. The emulsion will break after enough water evaporates from it. Cold mix is commonly used on roads with less traffic."}

He was the son of Ayatollah Muhsin Al-Hakim, the worldwide leader of Shia Muslims from 1955 to 1970.\nAl-Hakim co-founded the modern Islamist political movement in Iraq in the 1960s, along with Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir Al-Sadr, with whom he worked closely until the latter's death in 1980. Though not among the most hard-line of Islamists, Al-Hakim was seen as dangerous by the ruling Baath regime, largely because of his agitation on behalf of Iraq's majority Shia population (the ruling regime was comprised mostly of Sunnis). This led to his arrest in 1972, but he was released shortly thereafter.\nHe was partially blamed for the uprising in Najaf that occured in February 1977, and so was arrested again, and this time sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his sentence was commuted and he was released in July 1979. The subsequent eruption of war between Iraq and (largely Shia) Iran led to an ever-increasing distrust of Iraq's Shia population by the rulling Baath party; combined with his previous arrests, this convinced Al-Hakim that it was impossible to continue his Shia advocacy in Iraq, and in 1980 he fled to Iran.\nSafely in Iran, Al-Hakim became an open enemy of the Baathists, forming the Supreme Council of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (SCIRI), a revolutionary group dedicated to overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime. In 1983, Hussein responded by arresting 125 members of Al-Hakim's family who had remained in Iraq, and executing 18 of them. This further embittered Al-Hakim's view of the Baathists in general and Hussein in particular. With Iranian aid, SCIRI became an armed resistance group, periodically making cross-border attacks on Iraqi facilities, maintaining covert connections with resistance elements within the country, and generally being a perennial thorn in Hussein's side.\nAl-Hakim returned to Iraq in May 2003 following the overthrow of Hussein's regime by the US-led invasion of Iraq. There he emerged as one of the most influential Iraqi leaders, with his longtime opposition to Hussein gaining him immense credibility, especially among the majority Shia population.\nInitially he was very critical of the US-led occupation of Iraq, saying \"we do not put confidence in the Americans, they have always acted against the interests of the Iraqi people\" and urging Iraqis not to follow the US's administration's dictates. However, he did give the US credit for overthrowing the hated Baathist regime, and through the summer of 2003 indicated some willingness to work with the Americans in setting up a civilian government in Iraq. By the time of his death, he remained distrustful, but urged Iraqis to abandon violence, at least for the time being, and give the interim government a chance to earn their trust.\nIt is unclear (as of late August 2003) who was behind the massive bomb attack that killed him. A spokesman for SCIRI in London suggested that supporters of Saddam Hussein may have been behind the attack; others suggest it may have been orchestrated by Sunnis not necessarily connected to Hussein who are opposed to the increasing Shia influence in the country; a few suggest it may have been carried out by hard-line Shia groups critical of Al-Hakim's increasingly conciliatory line towards the United States. However, as his assassination comes in the midst of a pattern of violence against Shia clerics in Najaf in recent weeks (Al-Hakim is the fourth to be assassinated), it is considered likely that the attack was motivated by anti-Shia sentiment rather than by a conflict between Shia moderates and hardliners."}

Before moving west, he had performed odd jobs, carpentry, and volunteered for military service during the Mexican War, although his unit was never called into battle. In 1849, he joined the California Gold Rush, earning enough to move his family to a farm in Lane County, Oregon. Once in Oregon he became active in Democratic Party activities, Elected to office first as Judge of the Probate Court for Lane County (1856), then as a legislator in the Territorial Legislature (1857).\nGovernorship.\nOregon was preparing for statehood in 1857, as voters had just approved a state constitution. Whiteaker was selected as a Democratic faction's nominee in the first state gubernatorial election, held in June 1858. Whiteaker won by a margin of 1,138, and was innagurated July 8, 1858. He did not assume office until word that Congress had passed Oregon's statehood bill on February 14, 1859. Technicaly, Oregon had two governors in the interrum, as Territorial Governor George Law Curry, was legally in charge until the state government-in-waiting was legally empowererd to take control. \nOnce in office, the new governor set out to untangle the large amounts of land claims and counter claims on public lands. He also promoted economic policies favoring home industries, products that Oregonians could make self-sufficiently. Although nicknamed \"Honest John\", this did not deflect his controversial stands on issues of national importance. Whiteaker held pro-slavery views which did not sit well with apopulation mostly in the abolitionist camp. Opponents often used this to attack him as a traitor as the United States descended into the Civil War.\nWhiteaker was not nominated again by the Democrats in the 1862 election, and thus left office. He did stay in local politics, winning three terms as a state representative (1866-1870), and election to the State Senate in 1870.\nCongress and \"Whiteaker's Ride\".\nWhiteaker was elected to Congress in 1878, as Oregon's Representative-at large. The Democrats had been weakened in the House, and needed one vote to prevail in their nominee for Speaker of the House. The vote was needed by March 18, 1879. Whiteaker, all ready on his way to Washington, recieved word of this urgency while on a steamer between Portland and San Fransisco, California. Upon docking in San Francisco on March 12th, he was met by a railroad agent, and rushed to a special Central Pacific Railroad express train at Oakland. The regular transcontinental train was 25 hours out of Oakland, but Whiteaker's train managed to catch up with it. He arrived in Washington on the morning of March 18th, in enough time to be promptly seated by Congress and cast his vote.\nThe trip cost $1500 at the time, an expense widely criticized by the Democrat's political oppostition and the media. Many referred to it as \"Whiteaker's ride\".\nWhiteaker served in Congress until 1881, retiring to his farm near Eugene.\nLater life.\nJohn Whiteaker would be called back into politics one more time, in 1885 when President Grover Cleveland appointed him as Oregon's Collector of Revenues at the U.S. Customs House in Portland. After 1890, moved back to Eugene, purchasing 10 city blocks in the central city. The area today is now known in Eugene as Whiteaker's Addition. He stayed in Eugene until his death in 1902."}

Most notably, he served as the sixth Governor of Oregon from 1878 to 1882 and Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1888 to 1889. \nBackground.\nThayer was born on a farm near Lima, New York on July 15, 1827. He recieved a public education before studying law in college. He was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1851. He then practiced law with his brother in Buffalo and later Tonawanda.\nA mining boom in Idaho Territory caught Thayer's attention in 1860, prompting him to move west. He arrived in Corvallis, Oregon in 1861, where he joined another brother, Andrew, at his law firm. In 1863, he would finally move to Idaho, setting up his own law firm in Lewiston. \nPolitical career in Idaho.\nIn 1866, three years after moving to Lewiston, Thayer was elected District Attorney for the Third Judicial District of Idaho Territory. From 1866 until 1867, he moved to Boise to serve for a session of the Idaho Territory House of Representatives. He moved to Portland, Oregon shortly after leaving the legislature.\nEarly political career in Oregon.\nUpon returning to Oregon, Thayer establuished a sucessful law firm in the city of East Portland. At this time, he became an active member of the Democratic Party. During the 1876 Hayes-Tilden Presidential Election dispute, Thayer was a member of the legal team which challened the certification of J. W. Watts, a Republican elector for Rutherford B. Hayes. Although sucessful, this challenge did not help Samuel Tilden prevail in the Electoral College.\nStill appreciative of his assistance in the Watts Case, the Oregon State Democratic Party nominmated Thayer for Governor in 1878. Thayer would win narrowly, by a margin of 59 votes.\nGovernorship.\nThayer's time in office is remembered as a fiscally conservative, anti-corruption administration, which sought to make the state bureaucracy more efficient. The State Board of Equalization, land law reforms, and the establishment of a State Mental Hospital were initiated under his leadership. He would completely eliminate the state's debt while in office.\nGovernor Thayer was often spoke out about the state's finances. Highly critized by Thayer was the process by which the State Legislature based its budget appropriations. He called for revenue projections to be based on actual revenues, not what was anticipated as the Legislature had often done in the past. He also refused to fund the completion of the State Capitol Building, stating that the building was too expensive and lavish for Oregon.\nHis lasting legacy was reforming the Supreme Court of Oregon into its present incarnation by statute. Previously, Circuit Court judges served also as Justices of the Supreme Court. After the statue change, Supreme Court positions were made a seperate, directly-elected office.\nChief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.\nThayer declined to run for a second term in the 1882 gubernatorial election. Instead, he successfully ran a campaing for Justice of the Supreme Court in 1884. Justice Thayer remained on the bench until 1889, the last two years of that term serving as Chief Justice.\nThayer died in Portland on October 15, 1899 "}

Benson (March 20, 1858 \u2013 April 14, 1911) was an American politician, a Republican, and the 12th governor of Oregon from 1909 to 1910.\nEarly Life.\nBenson was born in San Jose, California in 1858 to a minister sent west by the Methodist Epispocal Church in 1882. His father, Henry Clarke Benson, moved the family to Portland, Oregon to become editor of the \"Pacific Christian Accord\" in 1864.\nYoung Frank was enrolled in the Portland Academy, later continuing his education at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California. After college, he returned to Oregon, begining a career in education. In 1880, he took charge of the Methodist Umpqua Academy in Wilbur, Oregon. Benson assumed his first elected office as Superintendent of Douglas County Schools between 1882 and 1886. He relinquished the post after becoming president of a Normal School in Drain.\nBenson would return to politics in 1892, after his election as Douglas County Clerk. He was relected and passed the state bar exam in 1896. In 1898, Benson began practicing law in Roseburg.\nSecretary of State and Governorship.\nIn 1906, Benson would run for Secretary of State, winning both the Republican primary and the general election. The sitting governor George Earle Chamberlain won election to the United States Senate in 1909 and resigned the governor's seat. As Secretary of State, Frank Benson was next in the gubernatorial line of sucession, and was sworn into office March 1, 1909. \nFollowing Governor Stephen F. Chadwick's example, who assumed the governorship in 1877 under similar circumstances, Benson kept both the Governor's and Secretary of State's offices. Although this is normally forbidden under the Oregon State Constitution. He collected pay for both offices.\nGovernor Benson undertook no major changes in the state government despite holding two of the states most powerful offices. Instead, he called for a special session of the Legislative Assembly to pass a bill which had been overlooked in the last (25th Biennial) Session. This bill funded operation costs for the state's major institutions, namely the state's prison, reform school, mental hospital, school for the blind, and veteran's home. He also attempted to settle a boundary dispute with neighboring Washington.\nBenson had been gravely ill even before he accepted the governorship. Although his condition had seemed to improve since taking office, he left for California in 1910 to seek further treatment. On June 15, 1910, Benson telephoned his priovate secretary, transfering the Governor's powers to Oregon State Senate President Jay Bowerman until he could return to Salem. Bowerman was sworn in as Acting Governor on June 16, 1910. Benso had indicated that he hoped to return by July 20, 1910. He did not seek reelection as Governor; but won reelection as Secretary of State in 1910. Although retaining one of his positions, Benson did not return as planned. His health continued to fail in Redlands, California, where he died April 14, 1911."}

His siblings were named Ralph, Martha and Mary.\nHe received his early education in public schools of Hesper, then moved to Salem, Oregon in 1893. He entered Willamette University that same year and graduated with a law degree in 1896 at the age of twenty. He was admitted to the Oregon Bar the following year, practicing law in Salem until 1899. He then moved to Condon, in Gilliam County, Oregon, where he lived for the next twelve years. There he became a law partner of H. H. Henricks. Bowerman's service in the Spanish-American War briefly interrupted his practice of the law. \nHe married Elizabeth Hoover in 1903 and together they had three children: William, Daniel and Elizabeth. However, the couple divorced and Bowerman married Wayfe Hockett in 1914; this marriage produced two further children, Sally and Jayne. \nHe was elected to the Oregon State Senate from Gilliam County in 1904 and was reelected four years later. He served as president of that body from 1909 to 1911. When Governor Frank W. Benson was incapacitated by ill health in June 1910, he asked Bowerman. as President of the Senate, to assume gubernatorial responsibilities. On June 16, 1910, at age thirty-three, Bowerman became Acting Governor. \nMindful of bureaucratic economy, Bowerman advocated establishment of a Board of Control to administer the state institutions, which would permit fiscal savings by combined purchasing for state institutions through the office of a single purchasing agent. However, the Board of Control was not established until the administration of his successor. He acted to reduce the risk of loss through bank failure by prohibiting Oregon bankers from the use of speculative stock as assets if they had actively promoted that stock. In 1904 the citizens of Oregon adopted a direct primary law prohibiting party nominating conventions. But establishment Republicans, unwilling to relinquish party control over nominations, held an \"assembly\" in 1910 at which they nominated Bowerman as their candidate for governor. He was therefore cast in the role of opponent of the \"Oregon System\" of direct government by his Democratic gubernatorial rival, Oswald West. Bowerman campaigned on a platform supporting modernized highway systems, increased economies in the administration of government, and continued tight control of state land management. West defeated him, however, 54,853 votes to 48,751.\nAfter leaving the office of governor on January 8, 1911, Bowerman moved to Portland, where he resumed the practice of law. He was reelected President of the State Senate but retired following the 1911 session. As a private citizen he actively supported Oregon's first statewide bond issue for highway construction, a $6,000,000 proposal. He also served as an active lobbyist for years at the State Legislature. He died in Portland in 1957."}

After several years as a banker in Salem and Astoria, Oregon and a six month stint searching for gold in Alaska West gained an appointment to the State Land Commission. He proved effective in his position with the State Land Commission recovering almost 1 million acres of fraudulently held state land. After leaving the Land Commission he earned a term the Oregon Railroad Commission where he again found a great deal of success.\nIn 1910 he gained the Democratic nomination for Governor and went on to defeat his opponent and take the office. While in office West defended what he called the \"Oregon System\" which included initiative and referendum systems still in use in many western American states today. These systems led to women's suffrage, prohibition and various workers rights laws being put in to action under his lead.

It was under his administration the beaches bordering the Pacific Ocean were protected for public use; the office of State Forester and the Bureau of Forestry were established; and the Fish Commission and Game Commission were created.\nWest served only one term, opting not to run for re-election in the 1914 election.

Withycome emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1871, settling on a farm near Hilsboro, Oregon. After turning 17, he spent four years working on his father's farm. In 1873, Withycomb purchased his own 100 acre parcel on the Horace Lindsay Land Claim, later expanding his holdings to 256 acres. Agriculture became Withycomb's passion, becoming a prosperous livestock breeder and establishing a reputation as a sucessful scientific farmer.\nFarmer and educator.\nHis sucess led to his involvement in local farming organizations. He became a charter member of the Farmington Grange, and later became a leader in the state grange movement. From these platforms, Withycomb's efficient, innovative, and profitable farming methods became a model for farmers across the Pacific Northwest. His stature gained him an appointment as State Veterinarian in 1889, where he would diligently work to improve conditions of livestock health around the state.\nAlthough mostly self-educated, he was sought after by the Oregon Agricultural College at Corvallis (now Oregon State University) in 1898 to head up the college's experimental farming station. He recieved his Master's Degree in Agriculture 1891 from OAC. Using this position to advance Oregon agriculture, he would play a major part in introducing alfalfa and clover to Eastern Oregon, laying the groundwork for the region's future agricultural economy.\nWithycomb also became heavily involved in Oregon's agricultural industry, serving as president of the North Pacific Wool Growers and Northwest Sheep Breeders Associations. His tenureship on the board of the Oregon Academy of Sciences saw the dairy industry's profits rise from $2.5 million to $20 million. Such accomplishments built up respect for Withycombe statewide and gained the state Republican Party's attention.\nGovernorship.\nWithycomb would enter politics in the 1906 primary, losing the Republican gubernatorial nomination. The 1910 election of controversial Democratic Governor Oswald West energized Oregon Republicans, who tapped Withycombe for the 1914 gubernatorial race. He handily defeated challenger Charles Smith; the first Republican Governor to assume office via election since T. T. Geer in 1903.\nAs Governor, James Withycombe vigourously promoted agricultural development. A notable proposal from his administration was to ask the Legislative Assembly to subsidize flax production as a prison industry. \nThe Withycombe Administration backed the \"Good Roads\" movement, creating the Oregon Highway Commission while in office. With the new commission in place, a large road-building program was initiated, establishing many of Oregon's modern state routes and highways. \nUpon the U.S. entry into the First World War, Governor Withycomb took a vocal and patriotic postion in support of the war effort. He encouraged volunteer military service, and promoted the state's war industries.\nWhile in office, he took a strong position against labor unions. He spoke out publicly against the Industrial Workers of the World, claiming that it terrorized labor and would cripple industry following several instances of I.W.W. threats to disrput production in 1917. He organized veterans of the Spanish-American War into an Oregon State Defense force, and encouraged citizens in Eastern Oregon to form self-defence committees to defend the state against violent labor agitators. Withycomb used his powers as Governor to shipyard prevent a strike in Astoria, by calling out the National Guard.\nHis 1918 reelection campaign capitalized on his wartime acts, portraying him as a wartime Governor actively protecting the state and aiding the defense of the United States. These efforts gained him a second term, of which he only served two months. James Withycombe died in office of a heart condition on March 3, 1919, succeeded by President of the Oregon State Senate Ben W. Olcott."}

Olcott (October 15, 1872-March 3, 1952) was a Republican Governor of Oregon, USA.\nEarly Life.\nOlcott was born in Keithsburg, Illinois. He was educated at a Keithsburg elementary school and a business school in Dixon, later becoming a clerk in Chicago. In 1891, at age 19, he moved to Salem, Oregon, and became a roommate and good friend of Oswald West. West would become a major influence in the development of Olcott's political career. \nAdventurer and Banker.\nFor nearly 15 years, Olcott travelled throughout the Pacific Northwest, mostly in order to prospect for gold. Often this interrupted pursuits of other occupations, mostly in the field of banking. His trips would take him to Southern Oregon (1892-93 accompanied by Oswald West), back to Salem to become a bank teller (1893-1895), Northern Washington and British Columbia (1895-1897), and then back to Illinois for a career as a bank cashier.\nOlcott's sense of adventure prevailed again in 1904, leading him to Alaska. His journey ended notably when he drove a dog sled team to Nome, a trip of over 1,000 miles up the Yukon and Tanna Rivers in the height of winter. Settling in Fairbanks, Olcott found work as a gold dust teller, and later a bank branch manager. He managed to make a sizeable profit from gold prospecting, allowing him to move back to Oregon.\nBecomes a Public Figure.\nOlcott's good friend Oswald West had entered politics, heading the State Land Office. West offered Olcott a position in the Land Office, which he accepted in 1909. He became more interested in the political process, and was appointed by Governor Chamberlain to oversee the state's interest in a failed Portland bank, which held a large ammount of state school funds.\nAlthough he was a Republican, and West was a Democrat, the two had a strong friendship which transcended politics. Olcott ran West's victorious 1910 gubernatorial campaign, and contributed $1,500 to his friend's effort. He married Lena Olcott (nee Hutton), Oswald West's sister-in law.\nIn 1911, during Oswald West's Governorship, Secretary of State and former Governor Frank W. Benson, died of illness. Despite being from an opposing party, West appointed Olcott as Secretary of State to fill out the rest of Benson's term. Olcott would be elected in his own right to the office in 1912, and reelected in 1916.\nGovernorship.\nOn March 3, 1919, Governor James Withycombe died after serving only two months of his second term in office due to heart complications. Ben Olcott, as Secretary of State, assumed the Governorship under the state's gubernatorial line of sucession. Withycombe was so widely respected that Olcott refused to be sworn in until after the late Governor's funeral.\nOnce in office, Governor Olcott continued Withycombe's road-building agenda. Today's policy of leaving a protected buffer of forested land around state highways was instituted under the Olcott Administration.\nOlcott Built upon Withycombe's defense and state safety policies. His administration managed to obtain U.S. Army air patrols for spotting forest fires. He proposed legislation banning the Japanese from holding land in Oregon.\nThe growing power of the Ku Klux Klan in Oregon alarmed Governor Olcott, who did not hesitate to denounce the organization. He refused any Klan support for his 1922 gubernatorial campaign, jepordizing his nomination. Olcott narrowly won the Republican nomination, but lost the general election to the Klan-supported, Democratic Senate President Walter M. Pierce.\nLater life.\nAfter his electoral defeat, Olcott left Oregon to manage the Long Beach, California branch of the Bank of Italy. In 1924 he returned to Oregon to become a director of the Oregon Mutual Savings Bank in Portland. He died in Portland on July 21, 1952, and was buried in Salem. "}

(n\u00e9e Clapp) Pierce, Jacksonian Democrat farmers in Morris, Illinois on May 30, 1861. At the age of 17, he began teaching school despite only having a secondary education.\nThe ideas of Manifest Destiny as espoused by Horace Greeley, influenced Pierce to move west in 1883. After arriving in Portland, Oregon in June of that year, he found no available work. After a time working the wheat fields of eastern Washington Territory, he earned enough money to finally settle in Milton, Oregon in Umatilla County. There, he returned to a career in education, and established a successful farm.\nAs an educator, Pierce was drawn into local politics. He became well known for his pro-temperance views, as he regularly spoke out against saloons selling alcohol to his students. In 1887, he married one of his students, Clara R. Rudio, who would die during childbirth only three years later. He would marry Clara's sister, Laura in 1893.\nFrom 1886 until 1890, Pierce served as Superintendent of Umatilla County Public Schools. From 1890 until 1894, he served as Umatilla County Clerk, a prosperous time in which he earned enough money from land transactions to further his education. He then returned to Illinois with his family to attend Northwestern University, earning his Bachelors of Law degree in 1896.\nEarly political career as a State Senator.\nAfter graduation, the Pierce family returned to Oregon, where Walter set up a successful law firm in Pendleton. Between 1896 and 1906, he would manage a power company, speculate in land, and become one of the state's most renowned Hereford Cattle breeders. He won election to and resumed the office of County Clerk, between 1899 and 1903.\nPierce would successfully run for a seat in the Oregon State Senate in 1902. In his first term in the Senate, he unsuccessfully attempted to win passage of prohibition legislation, while successfully winning passage of a state subsidy of $6 per child for education. He was defeated at the polls for reelection, and retired from politics for a decade beginning in 1906.\nWhile out of politics, Pierce continued local and statewide activities. He took part in founding the Oregon Farmer's Union and the Public Power League, headed the State Taxpayers League, and took a seat on the board of Regents of Oregon Agricultural College from 1905 to 1927. He began advocating for using the Columbia River for hydroelectric electric power during this time.\nPierce attempted a run for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1912, losing to Harry Lane in the general election. In 1916, his constituents elected him to once again serve in the State Senate. Pierce then unsuccessfully ran against incumbent Governor James Withycombe in 1918 as a progressive Democrat. In the next election, 1920, he lost his senate seat by only twenty-seven votes.\nGovernorship.\nThe loss of his State Senate seat did not stop Pierce from further pursuing the Governor's office. In 1922, he ran a successful campaign against Ben W. Olcott, with aid from the Ku Klux Klan.\nAt the time, the Klan was growing in influence and power across the state, and had crafted an overtly anti-catholic and anti-sematic Cumpulsory School Bill. Governor Olcott was perceived as Catholic, and defiantly refused to work with the Klan in any way. Pierce had no such qualms, but was instructed by his advisors to not acknowledge any ties to the Klan. He lent his support to the school bil, and was swept into office with the largest margin of victory recorded in an Oregon Governor's race.\nAs governor, Pierce had to battle with a Republican-dominated legislature. His administration was able to continue the road-building policies of the previous two administrations, but could not win passage of a state income tax or assessed value license fees for automobiles. He attempted to gain support from progressive Republicans on issues of prison reform, reforestation, and hydroelectric development, but divided the state Democratic Party by endorsing Robert M. La Follette for president in 1924. In March 1925, his second wife, Laura, succumbed to cancer.\nIn the 1926 elections, Republican I. L. Patterson defeated Pierce. Upon leaving the Governor's office, Pierce returned to his ranch in Eastern Oregon to reflect upon his future political prospects.\nMember of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nPierce decided that he wasn't through with politics, and unsuccessfully ran for the 2nd Congressional District seat in 1928. This same year, he married Cornelia Marvin, the first State Librarian of Oregon, his third and final wife. He declined to run for a second, inconsecutive term as governor in 1930.\nPierce tried once more for Congress in 1932, a good year for progressive Democrats. He was elected amid exitement over the landslide Presidential election victory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Pierce would become a staunch supporter of FDR's New Deal, serving in Congress until his electoral defeat in 1943.\nOne of the oldest politicians in Oregon history, Pierce retired from politics at age 81. He died near Salem, Oregon on March 17, 1954."}

His parrents were emigrants to the Oregon Territory, having made the overland trip from their previous home of Bellvue, Illinois. Until he reached the age of 18, he worked his father's farm. He later attended Monmouth's Christian College, for one year. Patterson supported himself as a grocery clerk in Independence, later earning his way into a position there as a business partner. His participation in the grocery store would last for 22 years.\nEntry into politics.\nIn 1898, Patterson entered politics, gaining election to a seat in the Oregon State Senate representing Marion County. At the time, he was one of the youngest State Legislators ever elected, having been sworn in at age 32. President William McKinley appointed Patterson to the post of Collector of Customs, Portland District in 1898, and was reappointed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, serving there until 1906.\nIn 1899, Patterson sold off his share in the grocery store, and purchased a 300 acre ranch in rural Polk County. The farm would prove profitable, and paved the way for Patterson's later venture into a successful wool and hide business in Portland.\nAfter serving out his term as Collector of Customs, Patterson managed his business affairs and kept workinng politicaly inside the Republican Party. In 1918, the citizens of Benton and Polk Counties elected him to represent their district, returning him to the State Senate. In the Senate, he moved his way up and served as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.\nGovernorship.\nPatterson attempted to secure the Republican nomination for Governor in 1922, coming in a distant third in the primary in a six-man race. Despite this poor showing, Patterson had strong ties with the party's old guard. He won the Chairmanship of the Oregon State Republican Party Central Committee in 1924, going on to chair Calvin Coolidge's Presidential campaign in Oregon.\nHis profile statewide rose, and this secured him the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1926. He would go on to defeat Walter M. Price in that year's general election.\nUsing President Coolidge as an inspiration, Governor Patterson would govern the state in a financialy conservative manner; streamlining agencies of the state and vetoing legislation which would threaten balancing the state's finances. By 1920, the state balanced its budget for the first time in its history.\nHis administration notably continued improving state roads and highways, established the state's system of higher education, and directed the state prison system to house adult and juvinile criminals seperately.\nHe was considered a popular and well-respected figure by rivals and supporters alike, but suddenly died in office of Pneumonia on December 21, 1929.

Walter Norblad (Albin Walter Norblad, Jr.), Member of the United States House of Representatives, from the 1st Congressional District of Oregon between 1946 and 1964.\nFamily and early life.\nNorblad was born in Malmo, Sweden in 1881 to parents Peter and Bessie Youngsberg. The family's last name was changed by the Swedish Government to avoid confusion in military records. The family emigrated to the United States while Albin was very young, settling in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nAt age 12, Albin decided to support himself, mostly by means of odd jobs. He would later recount that the most notable jobs held during this time were newsboy, hot dog vendor, and clairinetist for the circuis.\nHe managed to earn enough money to return to Grand Rapids, taking night classes at the Grand Rapids Business College. After earning enough credits there, Norblad was able enroll at the Chicago Law School, supporting himself as a reporter for the \"Chicago American\" newspaper's crime beat. Graduating in 1902, he quickly passed the bar exam and moved back to Michigan.\nEarly political career.\nOnce in Michigan, he set up a law firm, and was elected District Attorney for Delta County.\nWhile visiting Oregon on business in 1908, Norblad met with an old friend who invited him to live in Astoria. He accepted, and moved with his wife in 1909. He began practicing law, and became involved in the community. His first government office in Oregon was as Astoria's city attorney from 1910 to 1915. He would also become a member of the local school board, and President of the Astoria Chamber of Commerce. Outside of politics, Norblad was involved in many fraternal and civic organizations.\nWith a prominent local political profile, Norblad went on to run for a seat in the Oregon State Senate, in 1918. Reelected in 1926, he attempted an abortive run for Oregon's At-large U.S. House seat in 1922. He was elected President of the Oregon State Senate in 1927, placing him as second in the state's then-official line of gubernatorial succession.\nGovernorship.\nThe death of sitting Governor Isaac Patterson on December 21, 1929 came as a shock to Oregonians. The governor had looked as he'd been recovering since contracting pneumonia late in his third term. Thus Senate President Albin Norblad was sworn promptly as governor. As soon as he was inaugurated, he declared his intent to run for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.\nTaking office during the Great Depression, Norblad's first attempts to improve conditions in the state were largely ineffective. Lacking a political identity statewide, and considered a Progressive by conserrvative elements in control of the state Republican party, Norblad was defeated in his primary bid in May 1930, coming in second-place. When the winner of the primary unexpectantly died a month later, Norblad took his name out of the running for the nomination, giving the Republican state central committee his blessing to choose a new candidate.\nFreed from having to contest an election, Norblad began focusing his attention on the economic situation in the state. He formed the state's first labor commission, later to become the modern Employment Department. In order to put men back to work, he authorized $2 million worth of road construction, and succeeded in employing 5,000 workers. The Oregon Coast Highway was begun under his leadership. Another $3 million was spent upgrading publicly-owned facilities around the state.\nThe Governor also took a personal role in pardons and labor disputes. A Pardons Board was established, and Norblad even interviewed pardin-seeking inmates in-person.\nIn matters involving the rest of the nation, Norblad accepted federal help in solving a long-simmering dispute between Eastern Oregon's cattle and sheep ranchers. The Governor indicated his support for the pending military draft legislation working its way through Congress. He also argued for the state's acquisition of federally-owned forest land.\nDefeated in his primary bid, Governor Norblad handed office to the victor of the 1931 gubernatorial election, independent candidate Julius L. Meier.\nLater life.\nNorblad went back to practicing law in Astoria, once again becoming closely involved in the community. He founded the Lower Columbia Association of Chambers of Commerce, and gained a $10,000 grant from the descendants of John Jacob Astor for use in the Astoria Centennial Celebration.\nNorblad continued his practice and civic activities in Astioria until his death on April 17, 1960."}

According to family tradition, it was at this time that he added the \"L\" to his name; the sign painter, who was putting his name on the door, insisted that all lawyers of substance had one and Meier suggested an \"L\".\nMeier ran for governor as an independent candidate in 1930, winning 54.5 percent of the total vote, outdistancing his nearest competitor, Democratic candidate Edward F. Bailey, 135,608 votes to 62,434. After serving as governor, he retired to his estate above the Columbia River, \"Menucha\", where he later died.\nHis family sold Menucha to First Presbyterian Church of Portland in 1950, which now operates it as a conference and retreat center. The Meier and Frank families sold the department store to the May Company in 1966. With May's sale to Federated in 2005, the store was renamed \"Macy's\" in September, 2006."}

Influenza-like illness (ILI) has a high rate of outpatient and emergency clinic visits, and a high rate of influenza-related hospitalizations, and influenza activities have been on the rise for a long period of time and are widely distributed geographically. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began using a new method to classify seasonal severity and applied the method to the seasons from 2003-2004 to 2016-2017. The 2017-18 season was the first season to be classified as highly serious among all age groups. \nOrigin.\nIn the 2017-2018 season, influenza-like illness (ILI) activities began to increase in November, and reached a long period of high activity nationwide in January and February, and continued until the end of March. The peak of ILI was 7.5%, the highest percentage since the 2009 influenza pandemic (7.7%). Influenza-like illness (ILI) reached or exceeded the national benchmark for 19 weeks, making 2017-2018 one of the longest seasons in recent years.\nInfections and Deaths.\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are no reports of childhood flu deaths nationwide. To monitor influenza-related deaths of all ages, the CDC tracks deaths caused by pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality reporting system. The system tracks the proportion of death certificates that list pneumonia or influenza as a potential cause of death. The system provides an overall indication of whether influenza-related mortality has increased, but does not provide an exact number to indicate the number of deaths from influenza. During the 2017-2018 season, the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (P&amp;I) reached or exceeded the epidemic threshold for 16 consecutive weeks."}

In 1972, they went on a trip through Europe and Asia to Australia.\nThe company name originates from the misheard \"lovely planet\" in a song written by Matthew Moore.\nTony returned to Asia to write \"Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip\", created in 1975.\nExpansion.\nThe Lonely Planet guide book series first expanded in Asia, with the India guide book in 1981, and expanded to rest of the world. Geoff Crowther was noticed for frequently inserting his opinions into the text of the guides he wrote. His writing was helpful to the rise of Lonely Planet. The journalist used the word \"Geoffness\", in tribute to Crowther, to show a quality that has been lost in travel guides.\nBy 1999, Lonely Planet had sold 30 million copies of its travel guides. The company's creators consequently benefited from profit-sharing and expensive events were held at the Melbourne office, at which limousines would arrive, filled with Lonely Planet workers.\nWheelers' sale to BBC.\nIn 2007, the Wheelers and John Singleton sold a 75% stake in the company to BBC Worldwide, worth a guess of \u00a363 million at the time. The company was creating 500 titles and went into television production. BBC Worldwide struggled following the loss, registering a \u00a33.2 million loss in the year to the end of March 2009. By the end of March 2010, profits of \u00a31.9 million had been generated, as digital profits had risen 37% year-on-year over the preceding 12 months, a \"Lonely Planet\" magazine had grown and non-print profits grew from 9% in 2007 to 22%. \nLonely Planet's digital presence included 140 apps and 8.5\u00a0million unique users for lonelyplanet.com, which made the Thorn Tree travel website forum. BBC Worldwide gained the remaining 25% of the company for \u00a342.1\u00a0million (A$67.2\u00a0million) from the Wheelers.\nBBC's sale to NC2.\nBy 2012 BBC wanted to sell itself of the company and in March 2013 confirmed the sale of Lonely Planet to Brad Kelley's NC2 Media for US$77.8\u00a0million (\u00a351.5\u00a0million), at nearly an \u00a380\u00a0million (US$118.89\u00a0million) loss. \nCOVID-19.\nIn April 2020 Lonely Planet made the decision to close its Australian and London offices and lower staffing levels globally in response to the loss in the travel industry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company continued to create its guidebooks, phrasebooks, maps, children's books and inspirational picture tutorials but chose to close its magazine.\nRed Ventures.\nIn December 2020, NC2 Media sold Lonely Planet to Red Ventures for an unknown amount. Lonely Planet offices continue to work in Dublin, Franklin, New Delhi and Beijing.\nProducts.\nLonely Planet's online community, the Thorn Tree, was created in 1996. It is named for a Naivasha thorn tree (\"Acacia xanthophloea\") that has been used as a message board for the city of Nairobi, Kenya since 1902. The tree still exists in the Stanley Hotel, Nairobi. It is used by over 600,000 travelers to share their experiences and look for advice. Thorn Tree has many different forum categories including different countries, places to visit depending on one's interests, travel buddies, and Lonely Planet support.\nIn 2009, Lonely Planet began creating a monthly travel magazine called \"Lonely Planet Traveler\". It is available in digital versions for a number of countries.\nLonely Planet also had its own television creation company, which has produced series, such as \"Globe Trekker\", \"Lonely Planet Six Degrees\", and \"Lonely Planet: Roads Less Travelled\". Toby Amies and Asha Gill (both British TV presenters) took part in the Lonely Planet Six degrees."}

The Iowa caucuses are closed caucuses, only allowing for people who are registered as a person in the Democratic Party to vote. Iowa gives 49 delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of which 41 are pledged delegates given to candidates based on the results of the caucuses.\nAfter a three day delay in reporting the votes, the Iowa Democratic Party announced that Buttigieg had been awarded two more delegates than Sanders, but Sanders had won the popular vote in the state. Most of the media outlets would say that Buttigieg would be the winner, but the Associated Press declined to declare who would be the winner until all recount voting processes had been finished. The official result and calculation of pledged delegates was delayed again by a further six days after the election as they needed to correct the results from 3.1% (55) of the precincts. Both Buttigieg and Sanders then requested a recanvass for 8.1% of the official results, which narrowed Buttigieg's lead over Sanders to 0.08 SDEs.\nThe caucuses would be controversial because of the delays in the reporting of the results. Much of the delay was as a result of the mobile application used to report voting totals. More controversy started because of the errors and continued changing in the calculation and reporting of the SDEs. The Iowa Democratic Party chair would resign on the 12 February 2020 because of the criticism of the reporting."}

IP address blocking is commonly used to protect against brute force attacks and to prevent access by a disruptive address. The blocking can be used to block access nor a particular geographic area, for example, the syndication of content to a specific region, otherwise known as geo-location and geo-blocking.\nProcedures.\nEvery device connected to the Internet is assigned a unique IP address, which is needed to enable devices to communicate with each other. With proper software on the host website, the IP address of visitors to the site can be logged and can also be used to define the visitor's geographical location.\nLogging the IP address which describes, monitor if a person has visited the site before, for example, to vote more than once, as well as to monitor their viewing pattern, how long since they performed any activity on the site (and set a time out limit), etc.\nKnowing the visitor's geo-location indicates, besides other things, the visitor's country. \nInternet users may avoid geo-blocking and censorship and protect personal identity and location to stay unknown on the internet using a VPN connection.\nImplementations.\nUnix-like operating systems commonly apply in IP address blocking using the TCP wrapper, configured by host access control files \"/etc/hosts.deny\" and \"/etc/hosts.allow\".\nBoth companies and schools offering remote user access use Linux programs such as DenyHosts or Fail2ban for protection from unauthorized access while allowing permitted remote access. This is also useful for allowing remote access to computers. It is also used for Internet censorship.\nAvoiding address blocking.\nProxy servers and other methods can be used to bypass the blocking of traffic from IP addresses. However, anti-proxy strategies are available. Consumer-ranked internet routers can sometimes obtain a new public IP address on-demand from the internet service provider using DHCP lease renewal to eluding individual IP address blocks, but this can be countered by blocking the range of IP addresses from which the internet service provider is assigning new IP addresses, which is usually a shared IP address prefix. However, this may impact valid users from the same internet service provider who have IP addresses in the same range, which unknowingly creates a denial-of-service attack.\nIn 2013, the United States court ruling in the case \"Craigslist v. 3Taps\", US federal judge Charles R. Breyer held that bypassed an address block to access a website is a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for \"unauthorized access\", punishable by civil damages."}
{"id": "841880", "revid": "1061539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=841880", "title": "Madlax", "text": " is an 26-episode Japanese anime television series produced in 2004 by the Bee Train animation studio. K\u014dichi Mashimo directed \"Madlax\" and the soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura. \nThe story turns to two young women named Margaret and Madlax, who apparently have little in common and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, losing her memories prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, \"Madlax\". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.\n\"Madlax\" was produced as a spiritual successor to the studio's earlier project, \"Noir\", and together with \"El Cazador de la Bruja\", these series constitute a trilogy exploring the \"girls-with-guns\" genre. The production of \"Madlax\" began in 2002 but it didn't last until Y\u014dsuke Kuroda joined the project that the series took its final form. While reviewers noted the resulting similarities between \"Noir\" and \"Madlax\", they also acknowledged the differences, such as the latter's less episodic and more plot-driven style and, in particular contrast to the predominantly realistic \"Noir\", incorporation of many supernatural elements, which the audience must often describe without further explanation.\nPlot.\nThe first half of the series alternates between the two leads. Madlax is one of the most efficient forces agents for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret Burton is a sleepy, clumsy amnesiac living in Nafrece, a country styled after France. When a \"picture book\", likely given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international criminal network Enfant, she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war, discovers that her current employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is hired as her bodyguard, and together, they uncover data that proves Enfant set up the entire conflict. Enfant eventually intercepts them and they are forced into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika, accompanied by her devoted and sometimes overprotective maid Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon.\nEventually, Madlax and Margaret meet and board on a search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who supposedly knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.\nWhile Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by Limelda Jorg, a Gazth-Sonikan sniper who holds a fight against Madlax ever since she failed to stop an assassination by Madlax earlier in the show. Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into clinical depression. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant Nakhl manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax.\nBelieving Madlax to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his mind control. Only now does the audience learn the back-story: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own father. To escape the horrible truth of her murder, Margaret split herself into three personae: the \"memory keeper\" Laetitia, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. Margaret then fuses her three personae back together to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Madlax, who should no longer exist after the fusion, appears and guns down Monday. It becomes true that Margaret has once again split herself into three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.\nWhen everything is said and done, Margaret fully releases Madlax so she can live her life freely and also adopts Laetitia as her younger sister so she won't be alone. Madlax ultimately makes peace with Limelda and they travel together.\nThemes.\n\"Madlax\" is set against the setting of Gazth-Sonikan war and the first episodes in contrast to the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika; later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as Limelda Jorg, and their suffering. In an interview, the director Mashimo stated that \"[t]he story is about portraying inner struggles of people, while showing what life is like in this place of madness and this other place of peace\". Accordingly, the series' title is a portmanteau of two English words, \"mad\" and \"re\"lax\"ed\", mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being.\n\"Madlax\" also plays as the story of Margaret Burton's search for her psychological identity. Based on the Mashimo Menu theme titles available to her, Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters (\"Gatekeepers\") one after another and learns about the lifestyles (\"Gates\") they represent. In the end, she finds her own \"Gate\", which is the new identity that finally replaces the one she lost twelve years ago."}

Hystiocites are specialized macrophages. Hystiocitosis is also used as a name for a number of diseases, which have this symptom. The diseases are relatively rare, they affect about one to two newborns per million. The WHO has classified the diseases in three groups. There are different forms of chemotherapy, to treat theose affected. \nA histiocyte is a normal immune cell that is found in many parts of the body especially in the bone marrow, the blood stream, the skin, the liver, the lungs, the lymph glands and the spleen. In histiocytosis, the histiocytes move into tissues where they are not normally found and cause damage to those tissues. These proliferating immune cells may form tumors, which can affect various parts of the body. \nIn children, histiocytosis usually involves the bones and may consist of single or multiple sites. The skull is frequently affected.\u00a0 Children over five years of age usually have the single system disease, with just bone involvement. Young children, especially infants, are more likely to have the multisystem disease. \nSymptoms.\nThe first sign of histiocytosis is often a rash on the scalp, similar to cradle cap. There may be a pain in a bone, discharge from the ear, loss of appetite and fever. Sometimes the stomach is swollen and painful. Occasionally, an area of the brain known as the pituitary gland is affected, and this can lead to the child passing large amounts of urine and being very thirsty. Other potential signs and symptoms include: weight loss, jaundice, vomiting, limping, short stature, delayed puberty, mental deterioration, headache, dizziness, seizures, protruding eyeballs, and/or a generalized rash."}

The character of Donna was not originally going to be written into \"EastEnders\" as a disabled character, but Hammond impressed bosses at her audition, and was awarded the part. Donna is the second disabled regular in the soap, after Adam Best (David Proud) who left the show in 2010. Speaking of her casting, Hammond said: \"I'm really excited to join the cast of \"EastEnders\". It's a great opportunity to be a part of such a big and popular show. Donna is a bit of a handful but they're always the most fun characters to play! It feels good to be bad!\" Donna's storylines have included: her fierce attitude, which often runs her into arguments; the introduction of her family; and a relationship with Fatboy (Ricky Norwood).

She revealed in October 2015 that she has received abuse from strangers in the street because of her disability.

So when I get out of my chair to do a scene on my feet, people don't like it. If I'm feeling good and want to walk in that scene, I will. But if I can't or pain levels are bad then I'll use my chair. I've been shouted at. I've had people say, 'Oi, why are you in a chair when you were walking on \"EastEnders\" last night?'\" Hammond also revealed how she had received criticism like this before joining \"EastEnders\" and that she can struggle with this backlash. \"People always think I'm this feisty girl and I can hold my own but in those moments you just don't think of anything to say.

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on May 15, 2005. The episode was written by Steve Callaghan and Chuck Klein is the director of the episode. The episode is about Peter Griffin going blind after trying to get a world record.\nStory.\nMort Goldman gets popular for getting the highest possible score in bowling. Lois goes to the bowling alley and is shocked to see Glenn Quagmire watching her in a bathroom. Quagmire gets arrested but is freed by his neighbor Joe Swanson. Lois and other wives in her neighborhood want Quagmire taken away from the neighborhood. They later say they will let him stay if he stops harassing women. They help Quagmire control himself using operant conditioning (learning about the consequences of one's behaviors). They take Quagmire to a shopping mall. Quagmire sees cheerleaders in a fountain and starts to feel worried. He finds a room with video cameras of women in changing rooms. He sees a woman having a heart attack in one of the cameras. He runs to the woman and does CPR. Quagmire gets awarded for saving the woman from dying. \nPeter feels sad because his friends have had success, but he says he has not. He thinks he will be famous if he gets a world record for eating the most nickels. He tries to eat many nickels, but gets poisoned and goes blind. Peter gets a guide dog and goes to a bar. He ties the dog's leash to a homeless person thinking it is a parking meter. He goes to the bar and does not know it is burning. He saves the bartender from the fire and is called a hero by a news anchor. Peter gets new eyes from the homeless person he tied his guard dog to.\nProduction.\n\"Family Guy\" was first cancelled after its 3rd season. 5 scripts were made in 2001 for if \"Family Guy\" was brought back by the Fox network. \"Blind Ambition\" was made from one of the scripts. This is the second episode where Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken get in a fight. This was supposed to be shown in the episode \"The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire\". That episode was too long to show them fighting, so it was put in \"Blind Ambition\". Some parts of this episode were made but not broadcast. One of these was during Quagmire trying to control himself, where Brian Griffin uses a forklift to carry pornographic magazines away from Quagmire's house.\nMany people called David Goodman to say they did not like blind Peter seducing his son Chris thinking he is Lois. Chris Sheridan said that people were also not happy with Quagmire watching Lois in the bathroom. The Fox network can not use the words \"Jesus Christ\" if they are not talking about Jesus himself. One part of the episode shows God saying \"Jesus Christ!\" when he accidentally kills a person. Jesus was put in the episode with God so that the part of the episode can be broadcast.\nReception.\nThe episode was seen by about 9.26 million people when it was first broadcast.\nKevin Wong from \"PopMatters\" said that the episode was better than the 4th season's first two episodes. Mike Drucker from IGN thought that Peter and Ernie's fight was funny in the first episode they were in, but said it was not interesting this time. However, Drucker liked the reference to \"Star Wars\" at the end of the episode."}

Chicken was one of the most common meats available during the Middle Ages.\nIn the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats. Chicken consumption in the United States increased during World War II due to there not being enough beef and pork.

The countries affected have not been able to agree on a common name for this body of water. So far, most countries called it \"Sea of Japan\". North and South Korea do not want this name, they suggested to call it \"East Sea\", or \"East Sea of Korea\". In 1992, both Koreas raised concerns about the name, at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names. The Japanese government says that only the name \"Sea of Japan\" (\u65e5\u672c\u6d77) should be used. South Korea supports the alternative name \"East Sea\" (Korean:\u00a0\ub3d9\ud574; Hanja:\u00a0\u6771\u6d77).

Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or a translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea. Very often, the name East Sea is listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as an alternative. The International Hydrographic Organization is responsible for naming bodies of water around the world. In 2012, it decided it was still unable to change the 1953 version of its publication S-23 \u2013 Limits of Oceans and Seas, which includes only the single name \"Sea of Japan\", to include \"East Sea\" together with \"Sea of Japan\".\nThe countries have given different arguments, for their naming proposition, but each name has its problems:\nThe International Hydrographic organisation made a resolution in 1974. In this resolution, it stated that in the case that the countries cannot agree on a common name for a body of water, all names should be accepted. However, Japan argues that the resolution only applies to the bays and straits which are shared by multiple countries, and in case of high seas such as the Sea of Japan, it is not applicable. Japan also cites the United Nations\u2019 policy for using the Sea of Japan as an official name for their reasoning."}

It is Japan's oldest major movie studio, founded in 1912 during the silent film era. The name Nikkatsu amalgamates the words Nippon Katsud\u014d Shashin, literally \"Japan Motion Pictures\".\nOverview.\nNikkatsu's history dates back as early as 1912 when 4 companies merged to form Nippon Katsudo Shashin Corporation, the first film conglomerate in the region to produce, distribute and exhibit theatrical films. In 1952 Chofu Studio was built in Tokyo as the largest modern film studio in the Asia Pacific Region at the time; the studio even had a permanent set of Ginza city. It quickly became the cornerstone of the company's Golden Era, together with its string of attractive stars who were then all exclusive to Nikkatsu; the legendary superstar Yujiro Ishihara, handsome young actors under the \"Nikkatsu New Face\" banner including Akira Kobayashi and Joe Shishido; actresses such as Sayuri Yoshinaga and Ruriko Asaoka; and directors Seijun Suzuki and Shohei Imamura. Nikkatsu flourished as the leading studio in Japan, enjoying box office mega-hits with its action films starring Ishihara (\"Crazed Fruit\"), teenage love stories starring Yoshinaga (\"Cupola, Where the Furnaces Grow\"), and \"Branded to Kill\" starring Joe Shishido, works with a continuing international appeal to this day - the films were so successful that Ishihara and Yoshinaga are still regarded as icons of the Showa period.\nWhen cinema attendance began to drop, Japanese studios slashed their annual film production. Nikkatsu, however, took a unique turn in 1971 when it launched the \"Nikkatsu Roman Porn\" brand, namely films for the adult audience. As one director recalls, \"I had total creative freedom, as long as I kept some nudity in the film\", the brand enabled Nikkatsu to be the only major studio in Japan at the time to continue producing films and hire young film makers. Thus, Nikkatsu soon became the hub for upcoming innovative talents, and many of the directors who were given this rare opportunity, later became dominant film makers in Japan; amongst them are Oscar winner Youjiro Takita (\"Departure\"), multi-time Japanese Academy winners Masayuki Suo (\"Shall We Dance?\"), Yoshimitsu Morita, Youichi Sai, Shinji Soumai, and many more. The brand continued until 1988 and many films from that time joined our proud classics library.\nIn 2005, Naoki Sato was appointed President of the company. Originally a producer himself, Nikkatsu's recent array of titles under his leadership includes cutting-edge genre films by Sion Sono and Takashi Miike, and dramatical masterpieces. They have been highly acclaimed, including numerous Japanese Academy winners and nominees such as \"Rebirth\", \"Cold Fish\" and \"The Devil's Path\".\nToday.\nToday, Nikkatsu's diverse business activities include operation of the production studio, overseas film acquisition, distribution, a cable TV channel (Channel NECO) and a Film Course at Josai International University. It is also a member of the Yomiuri-Nippon TV group, the leading media conglomerate in Japan.\nIn today's fast evolving market, Nikkatsu has a focus on international activities - in 2014, the company established Kantana Japan, a JV with a Thai production group - and seeks to work more closely with partners outside the industry and around the globe."}

Before choosing this strategy, the producer has to make sure that the consumer will likely buy from them again and not from someone else. Usually, there is information asymmetry: the producer knows how long the product was designed to last, and the consumer does not. However, when many companies make the same product, they compete. Then product lifespans often increase. In the 1960s and 1970s, the first Japanese cars were sold in America. Because they had longer lifespans than the American car models, American car manufacturers were forced to build cars that lasted longer.\nHistory.\nIn 1924, the American market for cars became saturated. That meant that almost everyone who could buy a car had already bought one. In order to still sell about the same number of cars, Alfred P. Sloan Jr. who worked at General Motors suggested that new cars should look different every year. This way, at least some car owners would buy a new car every year. This idea was not new. It had already been tried with bicycles, but people say it was Sloan's idea. Sloan often used the words \"dynamic obsolescence\", but people who did not like the idea called it \"planned obsolescence\".\nThis plan changed many things in the automobile industry, product design field and eventually the whole American economy. Smaller companies could not afford to re-style their car models every year. Henry Ford did not like the idea either. Ford was an engineer, and he liked simplicity, economies of scale, and strong design. In 1931, GM sold more cars than Ford and became the strongest company making cars. Changing the design every year meant GM had to use a body-on-frame structure rather than the lighter unibody design used by most European automakers because unibody is harder to change.\nThe words \"planned obsolescence\" were first seen in print in 1932 in Bernard London's pamphlet \"Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence\". London said the government should tell manufacturers of personal-use items to use planned obsolescence so people would always buy them. However, the phrase became famous in 1954 because of Brooks Stevens, an American industrial designer. Stevens was due to give a talk at an advertising conference in Minneapolis in 1954. Without giving it much thought, he used the term as the title of his talk. From that point on, \"planned obsolescence\" became Stevens' catchphrase. Stevens said planned obsolescence was \"Instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary.\"\nOther people quickly began to use the phrase. By the late 1950s, \"planned obsolescence\" had become a common term for products designed to break easily or to quickly go out of style. The idea of planned obsolescence was so widely known that, in 1959, Volkswagen made jokes about it in an advertising campaign. Volkswagen tried to make it look as though it did not use planned obsolescence: \"We do not believe in planned obsolescence,\" the ads said. \"We don't change a car for the sake of change.\" In the famous Volkswagen advertising campaign by Doyle Dane Bernbach, one advert showed an almost blank page with the line \"No point in showing the 1962 Volkswagen, it still looks the same.\"\nIn 1960, cultural critic Vance Packard wrote \"The Waste Makers\", which was meant to be an expos\u00e9 of \"the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals.\" Packard divided planned obsolescence into two sub categories: obsolescence of desirability and obsolescence of function.\n\"Obsolescence of desirability,\" a.k.a. \"psychological obsolescence,\" referred to marketers' attempts to wear out a product in the owner's mind. Packard quoted industrial designer George Nelson, who wrote:\"Design... is an attempt to make a contribution through change. When no contribution is made or can be made, the only process available for giving the illusion of change is 'styling!'\""}

The group stage draw took place on 31 January 2013 in Nyon, Switzerland, and distributed 52 national teams into ten groups of five or six teams. Each group was contested in a double round-robin system, where teams played each other twice, at home and away. The ten group winners and the four best second-placed teams advanced to the play-off round, where they were paired by draw into seven two-legged ties. The play-off winners joined the Czech Republic in the final tournament.\nQualified teams.\nThe following teams qualified for the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship final tournament:\nVenues and stadiums.\nThe competition was played at four venues in three host cities: Eden Arena and Generali Arena (in Prague), Andr\u016fv stadion (in Olomouc), and Stadion Miroslava Valenty (in Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b).\nMatch officials.\nThe match officials of the tournament:\nSeeding.\nThe draw for the final tournament took place at 18:00 CET on 6 November 2014, at the Clarion Congress Hotel in Prague.

{"id": "842492", "revid": "7834834", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842492", "title": "Saint Michaels, Maryland", "text": "Saint Michaels, also known as St. Michaels, is a town in Talbot County, Maryland, United States. The population was 1,029 at the 2010 census. Saint Michaels comes from its name from the Episcopal Parish established there in 1677. The church attracted settlers who engaged in tobacco growing and ship building.\nHistory.\nThe town was laid out as a abstractive development in the 1770s by James Braddock. Unlike the more typical 18th century grid-pattern town planning, Braddock laid St. Michaels out around a central square. The town was incorporated in 1804.\nA rural Anglican church that long predated the town gave St. Michaels its name. Despite this church's presence on the shore of the harbor, the town of St. Michaels early became famously Methodist following visits by itinerant Methodist preachers. Braddock donated land for a Methodist church in the center of St. Mary's square. \nThe town's earliest industry was shipbuilding, and as many as six shipbuilders were active in or near the town by the War of 1812. Their typical product was a fast schooner, a type later known as the Baltimore clipper. Such vessels were well adapted to collapsing blockades or outrunning pirates or foreign naval vessels at sea, and some were later used as private armed vessels carrying a letter of marque. \nThe town played a role in the War of 1812 when, in 1813, a fleet under the command of Admiral George Cockburn moved up the Chesapeake Bay, and targeted St. Michaels because of the presence of a militia battery erected to defend the town and its shipyards. \nUnder cover of dawn on August 10, 1813, the Battle of St. Michaels commenced as the British sent a landing party landed just south of the town, and after a brief exchange, validated the battery and returned to their boats. The British proceeded to bombard the town from the barges and a brig, but failed to destroy the shipyards or cause any substantial damage to the town. The militia returned fire from artillery batteries at Impy Dawson's wharf (the foot of Mulberry Street) and Mill Point (the foot of Carpenter Street). A contemporary report noted that \"several houses were pierced\" by the British fire. \nNearly a century later a story was recorded that as a result of the town's ruse of shading lights and hanging lanterns in the trees beyond the town so that the cannonballs would wave-off the town, the town was spared. Based on this story, St. Michaels became known as \"the town that fooled the British,\" a nickname selected during the sesquicentennial celebration of the battle in 1963. The Cannonball House survives as one of the structures reportedly struck by one of the shots, and is on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Saint Michaels Historic District.\nShipbuilding declined after the War of 1812, but an oyster industry revived the town a few decades later. By the late nineteenth century, most households in the town had at least one person engaged in some aspect of this fishery, either tonging oysters from the nearby waters of Miles River and Eastern Bay, or engaged in the shucking houses that came to line the waterfront. One of these businesses, Coulbourne and Jewett, founded in the early years of the twentieth century, is notable as a black-owned enterprise, and it early on came to specialize in crabmeat. As a means of marketing crabmeat, owner Frederick Jewett devised a five level grading system (regular, claw, special, backfin, and lump) which is still used by the industry today.\nIn 2018 Forbes published an article declaring St. Michaels as \"The East Coast Weekend Getaway You've Been Missing\".\nGeography.\nSaint Michaels is located at (38.783748, -76.222214).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and of water.\nSt. Michaels is located in a long, narrow neck of land along the Miles River. The village is a tourist attraction, and there are high quality hotels, inns, seafood restaurants, and gift shops in town. Tourboat cruises connect the town with Annapolis across the Chesapeake Bay. A for-pay public ferryboat service in nearby Bellevue also takes people across the Tred Avon river to Oxford.\nEconomy.\nAlthough the town's tourist industry has roots in the mid 19th century with steamboats bringing voyagers from Baltimore to the town, and with summer guest cottages opening for weeklong rentals beginning in the 1880s, tourism was not a major part of the town's economy until the 1970s. The impetus started with a maritime museum, which opened its doors in 1965, and a waterfront seafood restaurant and a tour boat (the Patriot) followed before the end of the decade.\nMajor employers include Harbortowne Resort, The Crab Claw restaurant, and the Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond.\nArts and culture.\nOne of the town's chief attractions is the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, located on land that was formerly occupied by seafood packing houses and a cannery. Saint Michaels is home to a number of historic bay vessels, including the bugeye \"Edna E. Lockwood\", a National Historic Landmark, and several skipjacks.\nThe Saint Michaels Mill is a 19th century gristmill and was added to the U.S. National Register of Historical Places in 1982."}

Fahn could read and write in Hebrew, German, Yiddish, Polish, and Ukrainian by the age of 15. In 1897, at age 19, Fahn married Rachel Keren and moved to his wife's hometown, the Polish city of Halicz. In Halicz, Fahn was influenced by the Karaite Jewish community and their unique culture, which Fahn often wrote about in his literary works.\nMid-life and later life.\nAfter Russia conquered eastern Galicia at the start of World War I in 1914, Fahn and many other Galician Jews fled to Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary. Fahn enjoyed the libraries in Vienna and worked as a librarian during his time there. He was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army on 1 December 1914. His military service ended on 2 November 1918, with Austria-Hungary's existence ending soon afterwards. Due to his house and property in Halicz being destroyed due to World War I, Fahn moved to Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w (present-day Ivano-Frankivsk). Afterwards, Fahn continued his work, but as a Polish citizen.\nDuring a 1924 trip to Mandatory Palestine, Fahn created a Galician Zionist colony there. Fahn himself thought about moving to Palestine the next year, but decided not to since he feared that Palestine would soon have an economic crisis. The decision by Fahn and many other Galician Zionists to stay in Poland ended up being deadly for them due to the Holocaust destroying most of Poland's Jewish population by 1945. In 1930, Fahn maintained a correspondence with Hayim Nahman Bialik.\nPersonal life.\nFahn and his first wife had two daughters. His wife died when he was 25 years old. Fahn's eldest daughter Hana was later murdered in the Holocaust while her two daughters survived. In 1905, Fahn remarried to a woman from the city of Bolechow, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Yafa, Fahn's daughter from his second marriage, died at age nine while Fahn and his family were living in Vienna. Yosef, the sickly son from Fahn's second marriage, eventually had a son of his own but he and his entire family were murdered during the Holocaust.\nFahn's exact year and date of death are not known; 1939, 1940, and 1944 were all proposed for this. One report states that he was arrested and killed by the Soviets for Zionist activities a short time before World War II began. Another, possibly more reliable report states that he was murdered by the Nazis and their local Ukrainian allies in Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w at the age of 66 in 1944."}

The crisis was caused by a massive electricity generation failure in the state of Texas; and caused shortages of water, food, and heat. \nMore than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power, some for several days. At least 151 people were killed. The total damage is estimated to be between $100 billion and $200 billion, making it as expensive as Hurricane Harvey and other major disasters.\nThe Texas crisis's proximate causes were two unanticipated shocks induced from the sub-zero temperatures (\u20112\u02da F in Dallas): a failure of conventional (thermal) generating supply, mostly from lack of natural gas, and a surge in electricity demand. Inadequate winterization caused freezing of the gas supply and many plants' control instruments. In a system with a winter peak of 66 GW, about 30 GW of thermal plants were unavailable. In its worst-case extreme-winter analysis, ERCOT had expected a loss of 14 GW of thermal resources. The February storm caused more than double the anticipated thermal outages.\nSimultaneously, electric heaters created a powerful surge in demand. About 61% of Texans rely on electric heat, mostly low-efficiency resistance heat, in poorly insulated homes \u2014 a seemingly sensible choice in a warm climate with cheap electricity, where home heating is often unnecessary. The demand surge caused by the cold came to about 20 GW or one-third of the winter peak. ERCOT based its worst-case analysis on a 2011 winter storm, the most severe cold-weather event in Texas in twenty years. The 2021 storm was much worse than that of 2011. It created an unexpected and unsupportable demand surge.\nTimeline of events.\nDuring the weekend of February 13-14, the temperature dropped more than what ERCOT estimated and as demand for electricity hit a record, the utility had to implement rolling power outages starting early morning Monday, February 15th. Temperatures in Texas averaged 30 degrees Fahrenheit lower than the normal during.\nOn Tuesday, 16 GW of renewables went down, including generation from wind, and 30 GW was lost from thermal sources including coal, gas and nuclear. By Wednesday 46 GW of total electricity generation was offline with 28 GW of thermal and 18 GW of renewable.\nAs the demand soared and regional power generators crashed, the frequency of the system also started to drop from the normal 60 Hz to 59.3 Hz. Had the system frequency\u2019s fallen below 59 Hz, the state\u2019s electrical system would have suffered from cascading blackouts which would have lasted for weeks or months and could have caused physical damage to equipment. This would have been much more difficult to recover so to protect the system, load was deliberately shed by the system operator."}

The script was set days after 9/11 in New York. Domineau said he started the script to show \"an exercise in bad taste\" to a student in a class. The script shows how the characters of \"Seinfeld\" would do after the attacks: Jerry thinks that dust from the destroyed towers is hurting his food. Elaine must keep dating a 9/11 survivor. George makes people believe that he is a first responder and Kramer tries to get a box cutter back from one of the terrorists. \"The Guardian\" said that the script perfectly shows how \"Seinfeld\"s characters would deal with 9/11.\nIn movies and television.\nJean Dujardin took out a joke about 9/11 in his movie \"The Players\". He hoped that this would make the movie more likely to win an Oscar Award. The joke shows a man secuding a women in an apartment in New York. An airplane can be seen hitting the World Trade Center behind them.\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Moonshine River\", Bart Simpson says to his father Homer that he would like New York better after two buildings he does not like have been destroyed. He then quickly says the old Penn Station and Shea Stadium.\nIn \"Family Guy\".\nThe \"Family Guy\" episode \"Back to the Pilot\" was first broadcast on November 2011. In the episode, Brian and Stewie Griffin time travel to the past. Brian tells himself in the past about 9/11. This makes him in the past stop the attacks and becomes known as a hero. However, this causes George W. Bush not to be elected as the President of the United States again. Bush starts a civil war that causes nuclear war. Brian and Stewie must go back to the past to stop the civil war. When they stop it from happening, they high five. Stewie says that it would look bad \"out of context\" (taking away the context to change its meaning). \"Time\" thought that the episode was made \"too soon\" but said \"\"Family Guy\" viewers live for 'too soon' moments, no matter how sensitive the material.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" also thought that \"Family Guy\" had \"finally gone too far\" (go over a limit) and \"Deadline\" said that it went \"past the Fox standards and practices\".\nIn the episode \"Back to the Woods\", Peter Griffin commits identity theft on James Woods. He goes to the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" pretending to be James Woods and talks about a movie that parodies 9/11.\nIn advertising.\nIn 2016, Miracle Mattress (a mattress store in San Antonio) made a commercial with a 9/11 theme to sell mattresses. The commercial shows the store owner's daughter and two other men. In the commercial, she says \"What better way to remember 9/11 than with a Twin Towers sale?\" Two tall mattresses are behind the men to look similar to the twin towers. She says \"Right now you can get any size mattress for a twin price!\" The two men fall on the mattresses and make both of them fall. She screams and says \"We'll never forget\".\nThe commercial made many people write angry messages to the store on their Facebook page. Mike Bonanno (the owner of the store) said that he did not know about the commercial until it was first shown to people. He made an apology on Facebook and closed the store down. Miracle Mattress was given negative reviews on Google and Yelp. The store opened again a week later.\nOn the internet.\nMany people have used internet memes to tell jokes about 9/11. Many memes joke about 9/11 conspiracy theories with phrases such as \"Bush did 9/11\" and \"jet fuel can't melt steel beams\"."}

With its beak the bird probes mudflats for food. \nIn pre-modern times the world had many more mudflats than it does today. Many have been eliminated by draining so as to give more land for farming. So, in England, the places suitable for the bird were in river estuaries and low-lying land. Originally, southern England had wide areas of mudflats suitable for the bird.\nWhat changed was the draining of the \"levels\" to make for better farming. In England areas in East Anglia, Kent and Somerset were all drained and made productive farmland. A similar process happened in many countries. The consequence is that the curlews' numbers have dropped and the bird has become rare in places where it was once common.\nBroadly speaking, curlews are waders, as are the godwits which look similar but have straight bills.\nMost curlews migrate and so one or more species occur at different times of the year in Europe, Ireland, Britain, Iberia, Iceland, Africa, Southeast Asia, Siberia, North America, South America and Australasia.

However, the world is committed to preventing new HIV infections and ensuring that everyone living with HIV has access to HIV treatment. In 2019, an estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, since 2010, the number of new HIV infections fell by 23%. For example, in one year, this is different from the number of people diagnosed with HIV in one year. Worldwide, about 81 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status in 2019. The remaining 19% (about 710 million people) still need access to HIV testing services. Important way HIV testing is the gateway to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.\nHIV/AIDS pandemic by continent.\nAfrica.\nHIV/AIDS is a major concern epidemic in Africa and cause of death in many parts of Africa. Although the continent contains about 15.2% of the world's population, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for about 69% of HIV patients, and 70% of all AIDS deaths in 2011. In the North African countries have the lowest prevalence rates, as their populations usually share cultural patterns that reduce the spread of the disease, in contrast to what the desert countries did in Africa. Southern Africa is the most affected region on the continent. As of 2011, HIV has infected at least 10% of the population in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nEurope.\nAIDS cases in most countries in Western Europe have fallen to levels not seen since the initial outbreak; many people attribute this trend to active education campaigns, blood transfusion screening and increased condom use. In addition, since new AIDS treatments have proven to be effective (even if expensive) methods to suppress HIV, Western Europe\u2019s AIDS mortality rate has also fallen very much in the past few years. There are many ways to transmit HIV, including paid sex, sex between men, injecting drugs, mother-to-child behavior, and heterosexual behavior. However, many new infections in this area have occurred through contact with HIV-infected people in other areas. The prevalence of adults (15-49 years old) in the region is 0.3%, and there are currently 570,000 to 890,000 HIV-infected persons. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, the number of deaths from AIDS has remained low since the trough in the late 1990s. However, in some countries, there is still a large number of undiagnosed HIV, and the evidence of resistance to antiretroviral drugs in some newly infected people in the region is worrying. In addition, the risky behaviors of men who come into contact with men have recently increased.\nAsia.\nAs of 2008, 4.7 million people in Asia were infected with HIV. The United Nations believes that the epidemic in Asia peaked in the mid-1990s, and that the annual rate of HIV infection subsequently decreased by more than half. Regionally, the epidemic has remained fairly stable since the 2000s.\nNorth America.\nIn 2016, it was estimated that 1.5 million adults and children were infected with HIV / AIDS in North America, excluding Central America and the Caribbean. 70,000 adults and children are newly infected each year, with an adult prevalence rate of 0.5%. 26,000 people die of AIDS in North America each year.\nSouth America.\nAt the beginning of 2018, there are almost about 1 million people living with HI /AIDS in South America. By the number of its population, Brazil is the country with the most HIV-positive people with 830,000 people. As of April 2018, Chile is the country with the most infections. While the Falkland Islands are the only territory where no cases were detected. The biggest problem that exists is discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS in less developed countries. This is due to ignorance of the disease, with outdated premises and the high religious population by influenced to other people.\nOceania.\nIn this region, the national conditions regarding HIV and AIDS vary greatly. Part of the reason is the distance between the major islands in Oceania. The extensive development of the region also plays an important role. It is estimated that the prevalence of between 0.2 to 0.7 percent, there are currently 45,000 to 120,000 adults and children living with HIV. Papua New Guinea is one of the worst AIDS epidemic in the region. According to UNAIDS, since 1997, HIV cases in the country at a rate of 30% per year, by the end of 2006, HIV prevalence in the country is about 1.3% from the population."}

Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the \"pollenizer\".\nTo be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use.\nAlthough it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads.\nBees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. Hoverflies (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments.\nThe list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquitoes, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents.\nWild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators.

In mid-1st decade of the 20th century, Tonaki fled to Hawaii to avoid the Russo-Japanese War and worked at a sugar refinery for about ten years before returning to Okinawa, working as a farmer until age 89. He married a woman named Kame (who was eight years younger and died at age 61 during the Battle of Okinawa) and had six children (of whom one died young of liver disease and four, all except his second son, died during the Battle of Okinawa).\nTonaki became the oldest living man in Japan just 40 days before his 107th birthday, on 20 September 1991, after 108-year-old Gihei Oka's death and also the oldest living Japanese man overall, later on 16 February 1992 after the 109 years, 13 days old Russo-Japanese War veteran Mamoru Eto's death, as Eto who was just 4 days younger than Oka emigrated to the United States, and later on 30 October 1994 only the second Japanese man who became a supercentenarian, after Eiju Tsuru who died on 11 January 1990, just 24 days before his 111th birthday, although Shigechiyo Izumi who died on 21 February 1986 was still believed to have been aged 120 years, 237 days and Denzo Ishizaki claimed to have been ten days older than Tonaki, as his birth register which showed a birth year of 1886 rather than 1884 was claimed to have been delayed by two years.\nAfter 111-year-old Frenchman \u00c9mile Fourcade's death on 29 December 1995, Tonaki became the last living man born in 1884 as well as the second-oldest living man behind Danish-born Americanman Christian Mortensen, although Americanman Johnson Parks has been verified to have been 15 days older than Tonaki but recently become disputed after a study proving that he may have been born around ten years later than he claimed."}

Three years later, on December 8, 2007, the FBI named him as the 489th fugitive to be put on its Ten Most Wanted list.\nOn November 29, 2004, Robert Keith Palomares, a 24-year-old armored car guard, was carrying the weekend deposits just outside the AMC theater at 4915 E. Ray Road in Phoenix. Not long after 10 a.m., a hooded gunman ambushed and shot Palomares with a .45 caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol. Five of six bullets struck Palomares in his head. Though he was armed, Palomares didn't have time to defend himself. The gunman took a bag of money with $56,000 in cash and left the crime scene on a bicycle. Palomares was taken to the Good Samaritan Hospital. He was pronounced dead.\nWitnesses had described the shooter as between 25 and 30 years old and Hispanic. The authorities then recovered the bicycle. They lifted fingerprints from it that linked Brown to the ambush murder. Brown was then the prime suspect in the case. He was charged by the Maricopa County Superior Court with armed robbery and first degree murder on December 4. Two days later, he was charged with a federal count of Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution by United States District Court for the District of Arizona.\nBrown was born in Los Angeles, California"}

He painted the painting in 1907.\nInfluences.\nKlimt was a Symbolist artist and this painting was part of his Golden Phase. The painting is covered in gilt and other shining decoration. Art Nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, Byzantine art and Egyptian art influenced Klimt at this time.\nKlimt prepared carefully before painting the painting. He started in 1902. He drew over 100 sketches to practice. Klimt went to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna and looked at Byzantine mosaics.\nKlimt started with gold leaf and silver leaf and then put gesso on top to make patterns.\nHistory.\nAccording to Klimt's website, Bloch-Bauer was his mistress. She is also the only woman he ever painted twice. Adele's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, hired Klimt to paint both paintings. Klimt painted \"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II\" in 1912. Some artists also think Adele Bloch-Bauer might be the woman in \"The Kiss\" and \"Judith and the Head of Holofernes\".\nBefore Adele Bloch-Bauer died, she said she wanted the painting to go to the Belvedere Gallery. But, at the time, the painting belonged to her husband and not to her.\nDuring World War II, the Nazis stole the painting from Bloch-Bauer's family. It did end up in the Belvedere Gallery.\nOne of the reasons this painting is famous is that it was in a United States Supreme Court case, \"Republic of Austria v. Altmann\", in 2004. Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann, tried to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. The Supreme Court said the painting was Altmann's. Because Aultmann could not pay for insurance and storage, she sold the painting to Ronald Lauder to put in the Neue Gallery in New York City.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 2015 movie \"Woman in Gold\" is about Maria Altmann trying to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery."}

Toshio Fukui, the leader of the GS Ox band, who saw the performance of \"Tel Me\" at the Jazz Cafe \"Number Ichiban\", said: \"Only our band and have the Binson resonance chamber in Japan! \" Noguchi joined the band in December 1967, but at the time he didn't know what Binson was. He made his debut as the vocalist of \"Ox\" in May 1968. His stage name is Hideto Noguchi, in honor of Meiji era bacteriologist Hideyo Noguchi. He made Top 10 and Top 20 hits like \"Girl Friend\", \"Dancing Seventeen\", \"Swan no Nami\" and \"I'm Burning\". The \"Girl Friend\", \"Swan no Nami\" and other two songs were composed by . At the beginning of her debut, Ai Akamatsu's popularity preceded him, but when he released his second single, \"Dancing Seventeen,\" it overwhelmingly separated him from the popularity poll, and the center of popularity shifted to Hideto Noguchi. In the mid to late GS boom, many dialogues between , and Hideto Noguchi were seen in magazines.\nPerformances began at six venues across the country in September, causing a swoon on the stage at every venue, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya Public Hall on the first day, which the media hyped them as \"bands passing out.\" Ox was called the \"GS Gosanke\" along with and . On May 23, 1970, the Ox held the \"Subtitle\" Second Anniversary Concert and \"Blow Off Elvis Presley\". It was a concert that also served as a new song announcement for me, but Ox at the time was still quite popular along side with the Tigers. The group was disbanded on May 31, 1971. In that same year, Hideto made his first solo debut with \"Masked\". After that, he released singles such as \"What Else Is There\" and \"Yozora no Fuseki\", and released the album \"Hidetokara You ni\" which contains his own \"Clown Who Forgot To Laugh\" line.\nSolo debut.\nIn 1975, he prepared to leave from the \"All Japan Kayo Championship\" and won 10 awards every weeks.

Also, despite being released in September, it is in the Oricon Annual Best 100, and was selected as a candidate song for the nomination at the end of the year. Many of the fans were middle and high school students who couldn't see the GS era in real time, and Maki himself was concerned that it would end with a transitory boom.\nAs an aside, the kanji for \"ki\" with Hideto Maki was separated by Hiroshi Itsuki from the same office at the request of Yoko Yamaguchi. As a younger brother from the same office, he also participates in Itsuki's fan club event, and photos from that time are posted on Hideto Maki's website. In 1976, he won the Tokyo Shimbun Best Hit Award for \"Drowning in Love.\" In that same year, he won the popular award, silver award, and other awards at the Iizuka Music Festival for her third single \"Somewhere in Tokyo\". The guest at that time was veteran female actress singer Hibari Misora, and Hideto said that he became more and more of Hibari's fan when she said, \"I know you.\" At the time, master jazz pianist Yuzuru Sera said, \"Hideto is more suited to jazz than enka. I will teach you how to become a jazz singer.\" Every time he met him, Masato Fujita, a master enka composer, would tell him \"because one day, I'll write a music note with Hideto Maki.\"\nFujita's perception changed completely with the \"flow\" sung by Hideto on his special show when he was Ox, and even after his re-debut, the paternal replacement for . He also appeared on love shows. It is a pity that the dream with both teachers did not come true. In 1978, with George Yanagi and Rainy Wood, he released his seventh single \"Cammon\" beyond the limits of record companies. It is not an enka song, but a rock style song. At the time, the song was played with a playful feeling, but as she was about to transform into a rock singer, Maki's fierce opposition returned to the enka line.\nAppeared at the New Years Rock Festival (International Theater) (moderated by Haruo Chikada). The festival is produced by . The turn came between the Downtown Boogie Woogie Band and Rainy Wood, and Maki also sang the song). As an enka singer, only Maki appears at this rock festival, but Yuya Uchida spoke directly to Maki and took notice. \"Ame no Tokyo\" is karaoke and wired, and it won the best-selling award. After that, he released \"Happy Thin Woman\" and \"Hotarugawa\" and it became a huge hit. It seems that the number of adult fans has increased around here, and there are many male fans who like \"I am a happy slim woman\".\nPopularity and participation.\nAlso, Yuya asked him to appear in the \"Carnival of the West\" which was revived when the Nippon Theater was demolished, but Maki himself said it would be strange to appear again because Ox had refused to appear in the \"Carnival of the West\" in the past. . . It is said that he refused the offer. In 1988, Taro Morimoto asked him to join The Tigers Memorial Club Band, where he was able to balance solo and GS singers for eight years. (It is the largest GS unit released at the Osaka Castle Hall / Yokohama Arena concert).\nUpon entering Heisei, the song \"Genki no Hoshi\", which begins with the lyrics of \"Ace No. 4 from childhood\", became a hit song since \"Ame no Tokyo\" and is still played in the second match. of the Yomiuri Giants army. Sing the original song \"Thank You For Love\" on the 2010 project work album \"Shido We ga Hibi\". It is also a charity song for the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. On March 28, 2012, Sony Music released 21 songs by Hideto Maki and G \u2606 B \"Euphoric Flame Song\" to mark the 45th anniversary of the singer's debut, but they are still selling steadily.

It's been 50 years since he started as a professional singer in 2017. 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Ox first debut.\nOn September 9, 2018, due to fan enthusiasm, Yukihiro Kimura and Backbone Live were held in Osaka Moerado for the first time in 3 years and were sold out.\nIn 2019, he will appear on \"Eternal Showa Hit Kayo On Stage\" in May and July.

The sisters made national headlines for the high-profile murder of Regina's then boyfriend Oscar Velazquez in June 2000.\nOn June 6, 2000, Regina DeFrancisco called her boyfriend of three weeks, 22-year-old Oscar Velazquez, to her home. The DeFrancisco sisters' friend was at the home. The friend gave Margaret a .38 caliber semi-automatic pistol. Margaret then used the gun to shoot Oscar in the back of his head. Oscar was instantly killed.\nAfter the murder, the DeFrancisco sisters robbed the victim of just over $600. They drove Oscar's body in his 2000 Chevrolet Camaro Z28. That was where the sisters used nail polish remover, then set Oscar's body on fire. A private caller dialed 911 to report the fire. Just after finding Velazquez' body in the fire, he dialed 911 a second time.\nThe sisters tried to sell the Camaro. They were not successful. Regina and Margaret later abandoned the Camaro and set it on fire. Shortly after, the sisters were questioned by police as suspects in the murder of Oscar Velazquez. The sisters' stories, though, did not match up. Before Margaret and Regina could be arrested for murder, they left the Chicago area and began evading police.\nAfter just under two years evading police, Margaret was captured in Rockford, Illinois on March 24, 2002. An anonymous tip after a showing of \"America's Most Wanted\" led to her capture at an apartment complex where she was staying with relatives. Margaret was arrested for and charged with the murder of Oscar Velazquez. She was also charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.\nSeven months later on October 18, 2002, Regina was arrested in Dallas, Texas. The Chicago FBI reported that she was taken into custody after a traffic stop and high speed chase.\nRegina DeFrancisco was found guilty of murder and armed robbery. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Margaret was sentenced to 46 years in prison."}

These names sound similar to other regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in Tuscany, but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of yeasts, acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and anise seeds.\nThe confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of \"Biscottificio Antonio Mattei,\" the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop: \"Manufacturers of cantuccini,\" which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits. The sign has remained unchanged, and after such a long time people are accustomed to associate the name \"cantuccini\" with the biscuits typical of Sardinia and Sicily.\nPreparation.\nBiscotti is made with flour, sugar, eggs and almonds or pine nuts. Sometimes they have a layer of glaze, usually chocolate."}

Formerly, he was the creative head of ASA Productions and Enterprises until 2014, when he resigned from the company.\nHis directed his first film \"Jaanam\", which was produced by Mukesh Bhatt. His first four films did not fare well at the box office; his first successful directorial venture was \"Fareb\". Following this, he had multiple successful films such as \"Ghulam\", \"Kasoor\", \"Raaz\" and \"Awara Paagal Deewana\". After \"Awara Paagal Deewana\", he gave flops like \"Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage\", \"Deewane Huye Paagal\" and Ankahee. Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai was another flop although Bobby Deol's and Ameesha Patel's performances were well-received. In 2008, Bhatt came back with the horror genre and he delivered three films that were successful at the box office; these include \"1920,\" \"Shaapit,\" and \"Haunted \u2013 3D\". In 2010, Bhatt introduced stereoscopic 3D for the first time in India with his film Haunted \u2013 3D; the film was released in May 2011 and it then set the record of the highest grossing Hindi horror film of all time, making Rs. 270 million at the box office.\nIn 2012, Bhatt's Raaz 3D recorded domestic box office collection of 729 million after the 3rd weekend and the overseas collection was at 46 million. Riding high with the success, Bhatt is writing another horror-thriller for Bipasha in the central role, with a more shocking image than Raaz 3. Following the success of Raaz 3, Vikram Bhatt's written Hindi horror movie which has been directed by debutant Bhushan Patel topped the first weekend collection chart at the box office and the approximate collection was Rs 124.3 million nett. The movie further collected approx Rs 37.5 million nett in the second Weekend, taking the total to Rs 228.6 million nett. The film has been declared a 'Hit'.

Two of the films will be directed by Bhatt himself.\nIn early 2013, Bhatt announced his upcoming projects, Creature 3D, India's First 3D Monster Movie with Bipasha Basu in the lead role and 1920 London, third in the 1920 series. Vikram Bhatt will mark his foray into Marathi cinema with 'Ek Doosrey Ke Liye', which will be directed by Ashwini Kumar Patil."}

He is known for his strange lyrics and accompanying music videos on YouTube used as internet memes. Stauber has been a member of the bands Joose and Zaki. In 2020, he won the Shorty Award for Best in Weird.\nHis first album, \"Finite Form\" (2013), was released when he was 16. Inspired by folk music, his second album, \"Viator\" (2015), was released two years later. Stauber's third studio album \"Pop Food\" (2017) experimented with pop, lo-fi, and a 80s and 90s aesthetic. The first two tracks, \"Buttercup\" and \"Oh Klahoma\", went viral on TikTok, and has a combined 354 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. His latest album, \"HiLo\" (2018), has elements of funk, pop, and rock.\nStauber first published on YouTube in 2013. His website was launched in late 2017. The website mostly has links to other content such as his social media and merch stores. Stauber also has a Patreon, where he releases unreleased songs and videos monthly. He also releases full versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These full versions are usually released later under \"Jack Stauber's Micropop\".\nEarly life.\nStauber grew up in McKean, Pennsylvania. He has one sister, named Kharly. He majored in marketing and minored in studio arts at the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview, Stauber showed his favorite cartoon is Rugrats, and liked the art style, stating \"Take some time to watch a minute of the pilot of Rugrats if you haven\u2019t seen that before. The art style is beyond incredible.\"\nWork.\n\"Buttercup\" and \"Oh Klahoma\".\nStauber's most famous work, \"Buttercup\", is the first song released on his 2017 album \"Pop Food\". The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular internet meme, especially on TikTok, which helped with its success. The song currently has 279 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. Stauber did not release an official music video for it. The song has been described as \"bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals.\" YouTuber \"lisuga\" made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese film, \"Kick-Heart\". It is the most viewed Jack Stauber-related video on YouTube, with 191 million views as of May 2021.\n\"Oh Klahoma\", the second track from \"Pop Food\", also became popular. The song currently has 74 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories. However, the trend has become controversial, with critics saying the bedsheet costumes used look like KKK robes.\nStyle.\nStauber's visual style is known to be different, with some YouTube videos being dedicated to attempting to replicate the aesthetic that he utilizes in many of his videos. Stauber himself commented under one such video, expressing that he was impressed with the result. Meg Fair of \"Pittsburgh City Paper\" highlighted Stauber's knack of \"pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music\" and liked his ability to switch styles quickly. Jenna Minnig of \"PennState CommMedia\" compared Stauber's music to Ariel Pink's; as both have hypnagogic-pop styles and have similar voices, but believed it was not needed to compare the two. Fans of his music include American rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, actor, rapper, and comedian Andy Milonakis, actor Verne Troyer, indie singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, and model Paris Jackson.\nAnimations.\nAlong with music, Stauber is known for his animations. They are usually separated into three styles: \"surreal\", characters with odd and striking facial expressions and frequently part of his claymations, \"colorful\", which usually are featured in his VHS animations and music videos, and \"Stauber faces\", light-skinned characters with cartoon noses. Stauber is also well known for his frequent use of teeth in his videos and animations. He usually uses detailed resin teeth on his clay characters, although he has used real teeth. He has encouraged fans to send him teeth for him to use in his videos.\nTo make his animations, Stauber uses Microsoft Paint for the drawings. He then sequences the frames in Adobe Premiere Pro, and then runs the finished video through a VHS tape.\nDiscography.\nAlbums.\nStauber has four albums on both his Bandcamp and Spotify. Stauber uses the Plopscotch Records label to put copyright on his music.\nJack Stauber's Micropop.\nStauber also publishes under the name \"Jack Stauber's Micropop\", releasing longer versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These songs are less popular than his songs and albums released under his main name, Jack Stauber. These extended versions are often released early for Stauber's Patreon supporters. Under the Micropop name, Stauber has released six EPs and one compilation album, along with two soundtracks for his works with Adult Swim."}

She supported many artists. Adele knew the painter Gustav Klimt. She is the only woman he painted more than once. People called her \"the Austrian Mona Lisa.\" After her death, the Nazis stole the paintings from her family. Years later, her niece and some lawyers went to the United States Supreme Court to get them back.\nEarly life.\nAdele Bloch-Bauer was born Adele Bauer in 1881. Her father worked as a director for banks and railways.\nMarriage.\nAdele married Ferdinand Bloch when she was 19. He was 17 years older than she was. He liked her so much that instead of her becoming Adele Bloch, they both became Adele and Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. They both liked many artists, including Gustav Klimt. She tried to have children with him, but two of them died before they were born and one baby died after.\nAdele's sibling married Ferdinand's sibling, and all four of them used the same last name, Bloch-Bauer. Adele's sibling had two children.\nMaria Altmann said her aunt was \"rather cold, intellectual woman who was very politically aware and became a socialist. She wasn't happy. It was an arranged marriage but she was childless, after two miscarriages and the death of a baby. I remember her as extremely elegant, tall, dark and thin. She always wore a slinky white dress and used a long, gold cigarette holder.\"\nBloch-Bauer had parties for artists every week. Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss and Stefan Zweig came to the parties. Some of the educated people who came to the parties convinced Bloch-Bauer to support the poor and help women have the right to vote.\nPaintings.\nAccording to Klimt's website, Bloch-Bauer was his mistress. She is also the only woman he ever painted twice. Adele's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, hired Klimt to paint both paintings. Klimt painted \"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\" in 1907 and \"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II\" in 1912. Some artists also think Adele Bloch-Bauer might be the woman in \"The Kiss\" and \"Judith and the Head of Holofernes\". The first portrait was a gift from Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer to Adele's parents.\nDeath.\nAdele Bloch-Bauer died of meningitis in 1925 when she was 43 years old.\nLegal case.\nDuring World War II, the Nazis stole \"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\" from Bloch-Bauer's family. It ended up in the Belvedere Gallery.\nIn \"Republic of Austria v. Altmann\" in 2004, Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann, tried to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. The Supreme Court said the painting was Altmann's. Because Aultmann could not pay for insurance and storage, she sold the painting to Ronald Lauder to put in the Neue Gallery in New York City.\nLegacy.\nBloch-Bauer had a large influence on modern art. Also, in 2016, the street Bloch-Bauer Promenade in Vienna was named after her and her husband.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 2015 movie \"Woman in Gold\" is about Maria Altmann trying to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. Adele Bloch-Bauer is shown in flashbacks."}

{"id": "844194", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=844194", "title": "Zuzu Angel", "text": "Zuleika Angel Jones (June 5, 1921 \u2013 April 14, 1976), better known as Zuzu Angel, was a Brazilian-American fashion designer. She became famous because she opposed the Brazilian military dictatorship after the forced disappearance of her son, Stuart. She was also the mother of journalist Hildegard Angel.\nThis dictatorship was backed by the CIA and the US government, at least for some time.\nThe National Truth Commission was created in 2014, to gather and review information about crimes committed during this dictatorship. A former agent of the dictatorship, called Cl\u00e1udio Ant\u00f4nio Guerra confirmed that agents of the dictatorship were involved in the death of Angel.\nLife and career.\nZuzu Angel was born on June 5, 1921, in Curvelo, Brazil. As a child, she moved to Belo Horizonte, later she lived in Bahia. Bahian culture and colors significantly influenced the style of Angel's creations. In 1947, she went to live in Rio de Janeiro, which was Brazil's capital city at the time.\nIn the 1950s, Angel began to work as a seamstress. She usually made clothing for close relatives. At the start of the 1970s, she opened a store in Ipanema. At that time, she also started to show her clothes on American catwalks. In her fashion expositions, she always used the joy and richness of the colours of Brazilian culture. This made her well known in the fashion world of her time.\nAngel married an American salesman, Norman Angel Jones, and on January 11, 1946, they had a son, Stuart.\nForced disappearance of Stuart Angel.\nStuart Angel was an undergraduate student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's School of Economics when he joined the left-wing urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Movement 8th October (\"Movimento Revolucion\u00e1rio 8 de Outubro\" \u2013 MR-8). His fellow guerrillas gave him the codenames \"Paulo\" and \"Henrique\". He married fellow militant S\u00f4nia Maria Morais Angel Jones. His wife died in the custody of the military dictatorship's political police.\nOfficers of the Air Force Information Center (\"Centro de Informa\u00e7\u00f5es da Aeron\u00e1utica\" \u2013 CISA arrested Stuart in the neighborhood of Graja\u00fa, Rio de Janeiro on June 14, 1971. He was then taken under custody to CISA headquarters, where he was reportedly tortured. According to political prisoner Alex Polari, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Stuart was then tied to the back of a jeep with his mouth glued to the vehicle's exhaust pipe and dragged through the courtyard of the Air Force base. This caused him to die from rasphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. His body was never found.\nAftermath.\nAlex Polari wrote a letter to Zuzu Angel explaining the circumstances of her son's death. Based on Polari's letter and other evidence, Angel reported the murder to Ted Kennedy, who revealed the case during a speech at the United States Senate. Angel also handed a letter to Henry Kissinger, who was Secretary of State of the United States at the time. This letter was a translation of Polari's letter. She also gave Kissinger a copy of the twentieth volume of the book \"History of the Brazilian Republic\" by H\u00e9lio Silva, in which Stuart's death is discussed. According to Silva, among the reactions of the regime to the protests of the American-Brazilian community were the removal and subsequent retirement of Brigadier Jo\u00e3o Paulo Burnier, who Polari accused of being responsible for Stuart's death. The Minister of the Air Force, M\u00e1rcio de Sousa Melo was also dismissed.\nDeath.\nZuzu Angel was killed in a car crash on April 14, 1976. The suddenness of her death raised suspicions of government involvement; the case was investigated by the Comiss\u00e3o de Mortos e Desaparecidos Pol\u00edticos (Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances), under process number 237/96. This commission found many reasons to doubt the official version of events.\nIn 2014, the involvement of agents of the military repression regime in Brazil in her death was confirmed. A former agent named\nCl\u00e1udio Ant\u00f4nio Guerra, wrote the book Memories of a Dirty War. In this boo he details several crimes in which he took part and he also revealed details about historical events of that time, among them the Riocentro May Day Attack, the death of Zuzu Angel and others.\nCl\u00e1udio Ant\u00f4nio Guerra was the director of the Department of Political and Social Order, known as DOPS at the time. This department was well-known, because it was often involved in torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearance. Guerra said that army Colonel Freddie Perdig\u00e3o had been present at the scene when the accident happened. Perdigau was a known torturer. In a photo taken at the scene of the accident that killed the stylist, Freddie Perdig\u00e3o is seen standing close to the car. The photo had been taken on April 14, 1976 and was published on the day of disaster but Perdig\u00e3o had not been identified in the photo until Guerra identified him to the members of the commission.\nHomages and cultural references.\nStuart Angel is the patron of Juventude Revolucion\u00e1ria 8 de Outubro, MR-8's youth branch. MR-8 is now a faction of the Brazilian Democratic Movement.\nThe lyrics of the song \"C\u00e1lice\", written by Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil make reference tp Stuart's probable death by asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In homage to Zuzu Angel, and other mothers who were unable to bury their children, Buarque wrote the song \"Ang\u00e9lica\" in 1977.\nIn 2006, the events surrounding Stuart's death were dramatised in the \"movie Zuzu Angel\", directed by S\u00e9rgio Rezende. The movie, in which Daniel de Oliveira plays Stuart, is about Zuzu's struggle to find out the truth of her son's death.\nThe Tunnel Dois Irm\u00e3os, which connects G\u00e1vea to S\u00e3o Conrado, the same place where Zuzu's car crashed, was renamed after her.\nIn 2015, Angel was commemorated on her 94th birthday with a Google Doodle featuring a motif adapted from the prints she used in her designs."}

Each area is based on a Disney movie/cartoon. There are six areas, so there are six mini-games, all six are different and some are actually quite clever. Completing each game restores colour to Mickey's painting as well as unlocking a mini-video relating the the game's theme.\nFantasmic. Based on the film Fantasia, this is a bit like space invaders, but you are stationary and can aim in any direction in the sky. Basically aim at the nasties in the Sky, if you're attacked, you can also hit their projectiles out of the sky.\nAbove average\nThe Haunted Screen. Based on the film Haunted Mansion, this is a game about capturing ghosts on camera. The object is to capture the green ghosts on film while avoiding the red. The ghosts are transparent to begin with, you have to wave your hand over them to reveal their colour, after about five second, they will revert back to transparent form, if you leave the ghost alone, it will disappear and a new ghost will appear. You're only given a limited number of shots to capture a set number of ghost, this in turn makes it the hardest game of the lot (in my opinion), because the amount of shots you can take seem to be carried over from stage to stage. This means that you should try to get the maximum number of ghost (5) every time or you won't have enough shots for the later levels.\nExcellent, but can get tedious\nDonald goalie. Based on Donald Duck, this is a football/soccer game where you play a goalie, just save more than letting them in to advance. You have to keep the ball from going towards the back of the net against Donald, Daisy and the nephews. The opponents get better and can even curl their shots, basically meaning you'll resort to arm flapping later on.\nAverage\nAladdin Carpet Flight Sim. Based on the film Aladdin, you fly the magic carpet above Agrabah chasing Jafah and dodging the royal guards throwing fruit and vegetables, as well as knocking off guards who jump onto your carpet. You use you arms to steer like a bird gliding.\nAbove Average\nStitch Groove. Based on Lilo and Stitch, this is a memory game where you have to match the beats of the computer. Getting the right rhythm does not seem to be required, just need to remember the order of the beat. At the end of each stage you get a freestyle, meaning just hit anything to get bonus points.\nAverage\nPirates Battle. Based on Peter Pan, this is a hit anything that moves game where you help Pan beat up the pirates on Hook's ship, the boss fight against Hook is great fun that requires a bit of strategy and timing.\nAbove average\nBeat all the stages and you unlock free mode, which is just about getting high scores.\nThe graphics are average, but they work for the feel of this game. The sound is also average and not something that you'll remember or will be humming out. The EyeToy gameplay works fine, there is nothing really sophisticated about the movements needed, just remember in Donald goalie, if the ball comes towards your body, you'll still have to move your body or the ball will go though you. This is simply because the game detects movement, keep still and you'll be treated as the background.\nOverall a good game, but with only six games, you can finish it in one day, it might take longer for children. There's no incentive to play the games again after you've unlocked the videos unless you like high scores.\nDefinitely a game for children, but as an adult, you'll have mastered and drained it for all its worth in a weekend, so a rental might be enough for you."}

It was developed by Capcom Studio 1, and published by Capcom.\nDescription.\n\"Auto Modellista\" marked itself apart from others of the same genre genre, with cel-shaded graphics, which gave a hand-drawn and cartoon-like appearance. The gameplay was similiar to Gran Turismo, with the player picking a vehicle, then changing some costumized and race style type. There are six tracks, such as Suzuka Circuit, and the Mt. Akagi mountain pass.\nAfter poor initial reception, Capcom modified for the North America releases in 2003 called Auto Modellista: US Tuned (re-released Japanese version). This version featured American cars, like Dodge Viper, two new oval tracks, various UI improvements and a new handling model, that saw cars move slower and lose more speed turns.\nAlso at the same year, \"Auto Modellista\" recieved a follow up in the group of \"Group S Challenge\" for the Xbox home console. And the game also included from other Capcom games, such as \"Mega Man Battle &amp; Chase\", a racing video game based on \"Mega Man\" series, in the \"Mega Man X Collection\"."}

It was a secondary version of the M4 Sherman, which was mainly used for personal protection reasons, although the tank also used high-explosive anti-tank missiles and was heavily armored.\nHistory.\nA total of 6748 M4 (from July 1942 to January 1944) and 1641 of the late variant were produced with a 105 mm howitzer for infantry support, the M4 (105). Early models had the three-piece screwed nose, while later models had a mixed cast/rolled fuselage. The gun coat also evolved from the M34 to a more protective M34A. A known weakness of the early M4 was the slight flammability of the ammunition after a hit, especially because the cartridges were large howitzer cartridges, which then set the engine on fire or blew up the tank. However, many tanks of the states involved in the war had this problem. Because of this fire danger, the Sherman was also called \"Ronson\" by the crews (a well-known lighter brand with the advertising slogan \"Ronson always burns!\"), the Germans called it \"Tommykocher\". It was only with the M4, which was produced at the beginning of 1944, that this weakness was remedied by installing water tanks on the storage areas of the ammunition. This system, known as \"wet congestion,\" reduced the fire risk by more than a factor of four after hitting the combat room."}
