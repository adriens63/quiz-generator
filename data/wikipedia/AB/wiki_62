This is an end product of carbohydrate fermentation. The bacteria change carbohydrates to lactic acid and energy. \nThe bacteria are the order \"Lactobacillales.\" Most of them are anaerobic: they do not need oxygen. Usually, they can live well in acidic environments. They are either rod-shaped, or spherical. They are found in decomposing plants and milk products. \nLactic acid bacteria are important, and they are common. There are about 40 genera. Some species occur in the gut of animals, including humans. Several lactic acid bacteria are pathogens: they cause infectious diseases.\nLactic acid fermentation has been used since the Stone Age. It makes food last longer, and be easier to digest. Lactic acid fermentation is used in the production of cheese and yogurt.\nAdult humans originally could not digest milk products. Then, all humans were lactose intolerant (as, for example, cats are after weaning). \"Lactase persistence\" is the phenotype where genes prolonging the activity of lactase beyond infancy. Humans are unusual in having lactase persistence. We know it evolved fairly recently (in the last 10,000 years) among some populations. Still, \"most people worldwide are lactase nonpersistent\". They cannot digest lactose products after weaning. The evidence is that lactose persistence grew in human groups who herded cattle. To them it was a great advantage: they could digest milk throughout life."}

He is most famous for his work on the Trobriand Islands, creating a formal ethnographic process, and for coming up with the idea of functionalism. \nEarly life.\nMalinowski was born in Krak\u00f3w, Poland on April 7th, 1884. He was raised in an aristocratic family. His father, Lucjan, was a professor of philosophy at a Polish university and a linguist who worked on Polish folklore. His mother, Jozefa, was also a linguist. Most of Malinowksi\u2019s early education was learned at home. He traveled around the Mediterranean region with his mother when he was a teenager. \nAcademic career.\nIn 1908, Malinowski received his PhD in physics and mathematics from the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. In 1910, Malinowski moved to England to study anthropology at the London School of Economics (LSE). At LSE, Malinowski was taught by Charles Seligman, a British physician and ethnologist who did fieldwork in New Guinea. He was also taught by Edward Westermarck, a Finnish philosopher and sociologist who studied exogamy and the incest taboo. In 1916, Malinowski received a D.Sc. in anthropology from the University of London. \nFieldwork.\nMalinowski began his fieldwork in 1914, when he traveled to New Guinea to study the Mailu. His first ethnographic report on this fieldwork, \"The Native of the Mailu\", was written in 1915. Malinowski had trouble working with the Mailu because he could not speak their language and did not live with them, which limited his understanding of their culture. Because of this, Malinowski started new fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands in 1915. \nFrom 1915-1916 and 1917-1918, Malinowski did intense fieldwork on the Trobriand Islands, which helped him collect enough information to write multiple ethnographic reports. His most famous work about the Trobriand Islands, written in 1922, was \"Argonauts of the Western Pacific\". In this book, Malinowksi wrote about the Trobriand Kula Ring, a trade ring that enforced life-long relationships between neighboring groups. \nWorks.\nMalinowksi wrote many works about his fieldwork in the Western Pacific. These works include:\nLater career.\nMalinowski retired from fieldwork in 1918. He lectured on ethnology at the London School of Economics (LSE) from 1921-1923 and was offered a full time position at the university in 1923. In 1927, Malinowksi was made the Chair of Social Anthropology. During his time at LSE, Malinowksi taught many students who would later become well-known anthropologists themselves. These students included E.E. Evans-Pritchard, Ashley Montagu, Eslanda Goode Robeson, Godfrey Wilson, and Audrey Richards. Malinowski continued to work at LSE until 1938, when he moved to the United States. While living in the United States, Malinowksi worked as a professor at Yale University until his death in 1942. \nContributions to anthropology.\nMalinowksi made two major contributions to the field of anthropology. The first was his theory of functionalism. Malinowksi claimed that culture groups needed to meet the individual needs of their people in order to function properly. These individual needs can range anywhere from food and shelter to the need for security and happiness. The Kula Ring is great example of the concept of functionalism. It uses gift-giving as a way to fulfill the need for political organization among the Trobriand people. People who received the best Kula gifts, red-shelled necklaces or white-shelled armbands, were given a higher social rank in Trobriand society.\nHis second major contribution was creating a formal ethnographic process. Malinowski believed that an anthropologist needed to live with the people that they were studying. He placed a strong emphasis on participant observation because it allowed anthropologists to learn local languages and customs, which would be helpful when writing up ethnographic reports."}

When the two batsmen run between the grounds, they score one run for each time both batsmen swap grounds, but when both batsmen are not in one of the grounds, their opponents can hit the wicket in that ground with the ball to temporarily prevent the batsmen from scoring further runs, and run out the batsman nearest that ground. The batsman who is in the ground at the striker's end of the pitch at the start of a delivery is the one who attempts to hit the ball during that delivery, while the other batsman only runs.\nEvery time one of the two batsmen on the field gets out, another batsman enters the field and has a new partnership with the batsman who did not get out. Each partnership is named by looking at the number of batters who were out before and after the partnership; for example, the partnership between the two batsmen who are on the field when only one batter on the team is out is called the \"second-wicket partnership\", because it happens after the team has lost 1 wicket (had 1 batter get out), but before the loss of the team's second wicket. Because of this, it rarely happens that a batter retires (leaves the field without being out) and a new batter enters the field without changing the number of the partnership."}

Both prey and predator populations grow if conditions are right. Alfred J. Lotka found these equations in 1925. Vito Volterra found them, independently, in 1926. For this reason, the equations are also called Lotka-Volterra equations.\nThe equations themselves are non-linear differential equations. \nThere are a number of pre-conditions \nIn this case the solution of the differential equations is deterministic and continuous. This means that the generations of both the predator and prey are overlapping all the time.\nThe solutions to the equations lead to the Lotka-Volterra rules:\nApplications.\nIn one of his books, Volterra provided statistics on the number of certain cartilagenous fish caught at some Italian ports in the Mediterranean. Volterra used the term \"s\u00e9laciens\", which refers to sharks. These often prey on other fish. In the table, Volterra provided numbers for 1905, and 1910 to 1923:\nHe observed that between 1915 and 1920, more of these fish were caught. He expained this as follows: During the First World War, less fishing was done. For this reason, there were more prey animals, so the number of predators increased. After the war, fishing increased again, reducing the number of prey animals. This also led to a decrease in the number of predators, which can be seen in the table above.\nThe use of the first Lotka-Volerra rule in economics is known as pork cycle.\nExtensions.\nThe predator-prey equations have also been the foundation of other work. Volterra himselft extended it to be able to model intraspecific competition. Intraspecific competition occurs when two aninimals of the same species compete for limited resources. Intraspecific competition is an important factor to regulate population density. It is also important to be able to adapt to a changing environment (and for evoution). Volterra did this by adding new terns to the equation.\nMost of Volerra's work is about extending the model to be able to handle more than two classes of animals interacting."}

Bat Trang Village is a popular tourist destination in North Vietnam. The famous village produces and trades many kinds of ceramics inside and outside the country.\nHistory.\nBat Trang pottery village was established about 1000 years ago in the Red River Delta region of Vietnam. Located in an area rich in white clay, the people of the village had the advantage of producing pottery. Five famous pottery families of Bo Bat village (now Ninh B\u00ecnh Province) came and brought pottery artisans to Bat Trang village. The five families and the Nguyen family of Bat Trang opened the first pottery production kilns in the village. About the 12th century, Hua Vinh Kieu learned some new techniques of pottery production from Guangdong Province in China and taught Bat Trang pottery makers how to make a white glaze.\nBat Trang Pottery.\nBat Trang village has produced pottery since the 11th century. During the 11th and 12th centuries, the Ly Emperors chose the Bat Trang pottery as a tribute for the Chinese Emperor. The village has about 80 percent of the 1200 kilns that had fired ceramics since the village was established. Throughout the years, the village's products have become more diversified. Bat Trang potteries are well-known and have gained popularity in many countries.\nBat Trang products are classified into three different kinds depending on their usage.\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Household items: plates, bowls, teacups, kettles, wine bottles, flowerpots, vases, jars, cups, pots, etc.\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Religious items: lamp stands, candle holders, incense burners, altar boxes, swords, etc.\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Decorative objects: altars, statues, and architectural fixtures.\nEconomic.\nSince the village was established, most residents there have been involved in the pottery business. The economy of the village now depends on tourism and sales of the pottery. Besides making income, the people also want to teach the craft and to keep the old skills alive.\nBat Trang ceramic village has become popular with tourists. Visitors can study the history, culture, and traditional worth of each of the handicraft products.\nPlaces and Activities of Interest.\nBat Trang Village Festival.\nBat Trang village festival is organized from the 14th to 16th day of the second lunar month each year. The festival brings various special activities to honor the first pottery making. The people of the village have some traditional games such as \u00a0\"xiangqi\" (or Chinese chess), chessboard, tug of war, choir. Many special ceramic products of the village's best craftsmen are displayed at the time.\nBat Trang Pottery Market.\nThe largest Bat Trang pottery market displays and sells many ceramic products of the village. Visitors can buy and learn to make pottery products. Located at the entrance to Bat Trang village, the market covers an area of about 20,000 feet (6000 meters).\nVan Van Museum.\nVan Van is a private museum of the traditional pottery of Bat Trang village. \u00a0Mr. Tran Ngoc Lam, a member of the UNESCO Center for Research and Conservation of Vietnam Antiques, built the museum in 2002. The museum includes 3 old houses from the 19th century. It displays more than 400 pottery products that were made from the 15th century to the 19th century by the people of the Bat Trang village.\nLocation.\nBat Trang is a small village in the North of Vietnam.

Sometimes, these two cultures may be similar, or they may be very different. Unlike culture shock, acculturation includes the ways both cultures influence each other. Also, culture shock is only focused on the individual or group who is entering a new culture. With acculturation, both cultures are looked at. Many things can be exchanged between the two cultures like language, ways of living, or foods. Acculturation is focused on the process of two cultures interacting over a long period of time, not once or twice. Cultural diffusion is different from acculturation because diffusion may occur once or twice, and means that there is an equal balance between the two things involved; with acculturation, this equal balance is not guaranteed.\nHistory.\nThe term acculturation was first used by people who study anthropology. They wanted to know more about how people from different cultures interact with each other and what happens when they interact. Psychologists have also been interested in studying acculturation but are interested in the effects of acculturation on individuals. Sociologists also study acculturation and how societies change from interacting with new cultures. \nModels of acculturation.\nThe process of acculturation can have four outcomes: assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalization. These four outcomes are shown in the picture to the right. \nUse of acculturation in social science.\nAnthropologists, Psychologists, and Sociologists all use acculturation to help explain changes that happen when cultures interact. One way of measuring levels of acculturation is through acculturative stress. This measurement helps relate acculturation to other ideas or issues and helps researchers understand what happens to individuals and groups during acculturation. Many studies have looked at acculturative stress and health of individuals. Other acculturation research studies have focused on immigrantpopulations to the United States and other minority groups."}

It was first broadcast on the Fox network on March 12, 1992. In the episode, Santa's Little Helper gets ill. The Simpson family must find ways to pay for an operation for Santa's Little Helper. \nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder. Jim Reardon is the director of the episode. The episode was made because writers of \"The Simpsons\" liked making stories with Santa's Little Helper. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 14.2. It had the best ratings on Fox for the week it was broadcast.\nStory.\nPeople in the town of Springfield are very excited for the lottery. The Simpson family is so excited that they do not see that Santa's Little Helper is ill. Kent Brockman wins the lottery and gets $130 million. The family finds Santa's Little Helper and takes him to a hospital. They learn that he has a twisted stomach (GDV) and needs an operation for $750. Homer tells Bart and Lisa that they do not have enough money for the operation. However, he sees that Santa's Little Helper is loved, so he thinks of a way to get money for the operation.\nTo get money, The Simpson family must give up many things they like to do. Homer has to stop getting beer. Bart has to get hair cuts from a barber for free. Marge has to use food that is less quality and must stop getting lottery tickets. Lisa must stop getting parts of the book series she likes. Maggie has to have her old clothes fixed and not get new ones. After this, they get enough money for the operation.\nThe operation goes well and the Simpson family is happy to have Santa's Little Helper healthy. However, they start to get mad at him because of what they had to give up. Santa's Little Helper feels sad and runs away from their house. He is put in an animal shelter and adopted by Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns trains him to be an attack dog. Santa's Little Helper is brainwashed and is made an angry attack dog.\nThe Simpson family can not find Santa's Little Helper and starts to feel sad. Bart looks for him in many houses. He goes to Mr. Burns' mansion and sees him. Santa's Little Helper starts attacking Bart. However, Santa's Little Helper starts to think of happy times he had with Bart. He is then happy to see Bart and keeps him safe from Burns' other attack dogs. He goes back to the Simpson family and is shown love.\nProduction.\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder. Jim Reardon is the director of the episode. Producers wanted to make another episode about Santa's Little Helper. They liked the ones they made before, for example, \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". Reardon says that one of the hardest parts of making the episode is that Santa's Little Helper has to act like a real dog. Producers wanted to show animals act as how they do in real life and not show human features. The story of the episode is similar to an event with Swartzwelder's dog. The \"Gold Coast Bulletin\" said that the Simpson family's problem with the price of the operation is a \"very real\" problem. They said that many families do not help with simple health for their dogs.\nReception.\nThe episode was first shown on the Fox network in the United States on March 12, 1992. It got better ratings than \"The Cosby Show\". \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Cosby Show\" have been in a competition that started in the 2nd season. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 14.2. It had the best ratings on Fox for the week it was broadcast.\nMr. Burns brainwashing Santa's Little Helper references a part of the movie \"A Clockwork Orange\". Nathan Ditum from \"Total Film\" thought that it is one of \"The Simpsons\" best references to movies. Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide said it is \"possibly the funniest \"Clockwork Orange\" parody I've ever seen\". Nate Meyers from Digitally Obsessed thought that the reference is \"brilliant\".\nTom Adair from \"The Scotsman\" thought of it as a classic episode. Nate Meyers thought that fans would not like the episode as much as others. However, he said \"there are enough laughs to keep the audience entertained.\" Colin Jacobson said the episode is a \"terrific program\" and talks about how the story makes the episode humorous. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\") loved many parts of the episode. They talked about Homer's dream of winning the lottery, the reference to \"A Clockwork Orange\", and a parody of the phrase \"No Animals Were Harmed\".\nBill Gibron from DVD Verdict talked about many parts of the story and how they make the best events of \"The Simpsons\". Nathan Rabin from \"The A.V. Club\" said that the part with Santa's Little Helper seeing Bart again was not as good as it could have been. He thinks that Santa's Little Helper is not made as good of a character as others."}

{"id": "806878", "revid": "806900", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=806878", "title": "I Never Met the Dead Man", "text": "\"I Never Met the Dead Man\" is the second episode of the first season of \"Family Guy\". It was first shown on the Fox network on April 11, 1999. The episode is about Peter Griffin trying to teach his daughter Meg about driving. However, Peter crashes his car into a satellite dish. This destorys their city's cable television. Peter has a hard time living without television, but he is able to find fun ways to live life without it.\nStory.\nLois thinks that Peter is watching too much television. She makes him go outside to teach Meg how to drive. Peter gives Meg bad instructions that make her fail a driving test. Peter drives Meg back to their house, but gets distracted by a television show inside another house. Peter crashes his car into a transmitter, which destroys the cable television in their city. Many people get angry at Peter for doing this. Peter tells them that Meg crashed his car into the transmitter. Peter says to Meg that if she will take the blame, he will get her a new car. Meg does not tell anyone that Peter actually crashed the car into the transmitter.\nPeter goes through a withdrawal from television. Peter cuts out cardboard in the shape of a television screen so that he can see everything as a television show. Meg can not deal with being treated badly, so she tells everyone that Peter broke the city's television. Lois gives a speech on how television was stopping everyone from interacting with each other. Peter no longer likes television and wants to do outdoor activities with his family. Peter later goes to a festival with William Shatner when the family gets tired of doing activities with him. Lois tries to teach Meg better instructions on driving. However, a rainstorm makes Meg run over Peter and Shatner. Shatner dies and Peter must go to the hospital. Peter is forced to watch television at the hospital, which brings back his addiction for television.\nDuring the story of the episode, Stewie tries to destroy his broccoli because Lois wants him to eat it, even though he does not want to. Stewie gets a See 'n Say toy and makes it a weather control device. He uses it to start a rainstorm to destroy all broccoli in the world (this is the same rainstorm that made Meg run over Peter and Shatner).\nProduction.\n\"I Never Met the Dead Man\" was written by Chris Sheridan. Michael Dante DiMartino is the director of the episode. The episode's title comes from a radio drama from the 1940s. This was also used for other episodes of the first season, such as \"Death Has a Shadow\" and \"Mind Over Murder\". This did not happen anymore after the fifth episode. Erik Estrada, Butch Hartman, Aaron Lustig, Joey Slotnick, and Frank Welker are guest stars in the episode.\nReception.\nAhsan Haque from IGN thought that the episode is \"one of the most memorable episodes of the series\". He says that the story and the jokes in the episode make it \"one of the finest in the series.\" Haque said that Stewie's plan to destory all broccoli is \"elaborate\" and \"creative\". Haque put Peter's view of everything as a television show on his list of \"Peter Griffin's Top 10 Craziest Ideas\". Robin Pierson from \"The TV Critic\" thought that the episode is \"A really fun twenty two minutes of television.\""}

German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered it. A related concept is the strength of memory: People with a stronger memory are able to remember things longer. Ebbinghaus tested how long he could remember random syllables, and recorded the results in his paper \"\u00dcber das Ged\u00e4chtnis\" (1885). In 1913, this was translated into English as Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology\". Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as \"WID\" and \"ZOF\" (CVCs or Consonant\u2013Vowel\u2013Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the \"forgetting curve\". Ebbinghaus investigated the rate of forgetting, but not the effect of spaced repetition on the increase in retrievability of memories.\nAs a rough guide, after 20 minutes, people can only recall about 60% of what they memorized. After a week, only about 15% is left. When Ebbinghaus did the experiment, he used meaningless sequences of syllables. In the 20th century, several other researchers repeated the experiment. One of them was Georg Elias M\u00fcller. For this reason, the results are still considered to be valid.\nTo be able to remember things better, more repetitions are needed. Things that are needed and used more often, will not be forgotten so easily. \nReferences.\nHermann \"\u00dcber das Ged\u00e4chtnis.

Today, he is mostly known for his work regarding learning and forgetting. He was the first to do experiments to explore how memory works. He first described the forgetting curve, the learning curve and the spacing effect. The Ebbinghaus illusion, which is named after him is related to the perception, not memory. His son was the philosopher Julius Ebbinghaus. \nIn 1896, he did a test on children in school: The pupils had to complete sentences, and their teacher had to rate each pupil, if the pupil was in the lowest, the middle or the highest third of all the people in the class. Ebbinghaus saw a relationship between the teacher's rating, and the result of the pupil, but he could not give a correlation (because he was lacking the tools to do so). This was possibly the first test of verbal intelligence in a group. \nMany of his experimental methods to rate memory performance are still in use.\nEbbinghaus died of pneumonia, when he was 59 years old.

One of them is, the punishment of the perpetrator \"with the same act\" in crimes \"committed against the physical integrity of the person, such as a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\". Another application is related to the social status of the perpetrator and the victim. In the tribal understanding, when a person kills a woman, a slave or an honorable person from another tribe, a person \"of similar status from the tribe to which the murderer belongs\" will be killed in return. As a general custom, killing the master's to slave, father's to child, husband's to wife was not punished with retaliation, and retaliation was not applied to the man who killed the woman as a rule. The condition of \"social equality\" in qisas means that; \"if a socially inferior person kills someone from the upper class, qisas will be applied\", whereas \"if someone from the upper class kills someone from the lower class, it cannot be applied\". \nIn this case, compensation can be paid to the family of the murdered person.\nThe main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara; 178 verse;\n\": \"'Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, captive versus captive, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well.\"\nIn traditional Islamic law (\"sharia\"), the doctrine of qisas allows a punishment analogous to the crime. Qisas is available to the victim or victim's heirs against a person convicted of murder or intentional bodily injury. In the case of murder, qisas gives the right to take the life of the killer, if the latter is convicted and the court approves. Those who are entitled to \"qisas\" have the option of receiving monetary compensation (\"diyya\") or granting pardon to the person instead."}

They live in tropical Asia. Scientists used to put 84 to 96 valid species in \"Hylarana\", but they looked at the frogs again. Today, scientists say four species are in \"Hylarana\".\nWhat they look like.\n\"Hylarana\" frogs can be small or large. Male frogs are from their noses to the ends of their bodies, and females are . The nostrils are oval in shape and there is a piece of skin on top of them. The ear drum is not covered by skin. They have vomerine teeth and a parietal eye. The toes on their back feet are webbed, but the fingers on the front feet are not.\nWhere they live.\nThe frogs that scientists used to say were in \"Hylarana\" lived everywhere from Sri Lanka to the Western Ghat Mountains in India, through Nepal and southern China and Taiwan, south to Southeast Asia to the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, in Northern Australia, and tropical Africa. The four species of frogs that are still in \"Hylarana\" today live in southern and southeast Asia.\nScientific groups.\n\"Hylarana\" is in the subfamily Raninae. They are true frogs, so they are in the family Ranidae. The name \"Hylarana\" comes from from the New Latin word \"hyle\" (\"wood\" or \"forest\") and \"rana\" (\"frog\"). Scientists used to think \"Hylarana\" was a subgenus of the genus \"Rana\", but they changed their minds in 2005. In 2006, scientists took \"Hylarana\" and split it into more genera. They treat these as junior synonyms of \"Hylarana\". In 2015, Oliver et al. looked closely at \"Hylarana\" again. They said that only four species are really \"Hylarana sensu stricto\": The other frogs were moved to \"Abavorana\", \"Amnirana\", \"Chalcorana\", \"Humerana\", \"Hydrophylax\", \"Indosylvirana\", \"Papurana\", \"Pulchrana\", and \"Sylvirana\".\nSpecies.\nScientists used to say this genus had 84 to 96 valid species of frogs in it. But they looked closely again. Now, scientists say only four frogs are truly \"Hylarana\": \"Hylarana malayana\" was placed in \"Hylarana\" in 2021.\nAfter these changes, scientists are not sure where a few \"Hylarana\" species should be placed:"}

The main idea behind these parks and reserves is to guard the values of nature, landscape, heritage, and species.\nFollowing the drying of Lake Hula, the Hula Reserve was established in 1964 and became the first declared nature reserve in Israel. It is a major stopover for birds migrating between Africa, Europe and Asia. In 1963 the Israeli parliament approved the \"National parks and nature reserves act\", and as a result, two authorities were established: the National Parks Authority and the Nature Reserves Authority. In 1998 the two authorities were merged into one body - Israel Nature and Parks Authority.\nIn Israel, the difference between national parks and nature reserves is often hard to make. National parks are in most cases centered around archaeological sites, but sometimes include protected nature as well.

It is explained by the German philosophers Georg W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche but with different meanings. In philosophy, the words \"master\" and \"slave\" are not always meant literally. The theme refers to a hierarchy of certain things or people being put beneath others.\nHegel's explanation.\nGeorg W. F. Hegel wrote about a certain kind of recognition that people need. According to Hegel, people have a need to be recognised as individuals by other individuals. People fill this need by being recognised by others who aren't put beneath them. Part of this happens when people struggle against each other, even to death. People will risk their lives just to struggle for this kind of recognition. However, the outcome of this struggle creates a problem for filling this need. The person who loses the struggle will either die or become beneath the other person. This is taking the part of \"slave\". When someone puts someone else beneath themself, they take the part of \"master\". The person who loses the struggle can no longer give or receive the recognition that is needed. Therefore, when someone is put beneath others it damages how they think of themself. But also, when someone puts themselves others, they cannot get the recognition they need from those people anymore.\nHegel's explanation of master and slave has become important in many fields of study. Some examples are in social sciences, discourse analysis, and psychoanalysis. The American researcher David Duquette says the more correct name in English for this philosophy is \"lordship and bondage\", rather than \"master and slave\". The American professor Robert Brandom also says that Hegel's explanation represents when duty and authority are split apart. Duties are only given to the \"slave\" but authority is only given to the \"master\". The problems of master and slave happen when people try to take one without the other.\nNietzsche's explanation.\nFriedrich Nietzsche wrote many warnings about the dangers of morality. Morality is dangerous when it harms the best people and favours the people beneath them, says Nietzsche. He explains master and slave as two different approaches to values and morals. The first approach values noble things like honour, courage, self-worth, and excellence. These people value things based on what they see rather than what they are told. The second approach is what Nietzsche calls a weakness. It values things like sameness and pity. He also calls these \"priestly values\" because they are often to people by priestly religions. He says the ancient Hebrews were an example of priestly culture, and the ancient Romans were an example of a noble culture.\nThe \"slave revolt in morals\" is when the weaker people force their weaker values onto others. This happens when they get resentful about being beneath the stronger people. When these values spread, they favour the weak and priestly people at the cost of the better and nobler people. Nietzsche also says they are life-denying values, meaning they have a negative and unhealthy attitude towards living. They are what make morality dangerous. Nietzsche does not say slave morality is always bad though. Instead, \"the ideas of the herd should rule in the herd\u2014but not reach out beyond it\". What this means is that weaker values be for the weaker people but for the nobler people. Before Nietzsche, the Russian nihilist Dmitry Pisarev had also said extraordinary people should free themselves from morality and priestly ideas.\nRelated philosophies.\nA slightly different theme of master and slave is also used by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. It is a main part of his philosophy even though it often stays hidden. Plato says that enslavement is when a person cannot master themselves. When this happens they become a slave to their desires. The opposite of this he calls \"self-mastery\". He also says that people become mastered by others when they cannot master themselves. For example, people have leaders when they cannot lead themselves. For Plato, the slave and master relation is when something natural and disorderly is put beneath something divine and orderly. For example, Plato says the soul is master of the body. He also says that the world is naturally disorderly, but is turned orderly and scientific only by divine things. Nietzsche instead says there is no divine orderliness that masters the world. According to Nietzsche, the ancient Greeks before Plato already understood this better. These ancient Greeks were able to balance the disorder of Dionysus, and the reasoning of Apollo. He saw Plato as destroying this understanding. And so Nietzsche saw Plato as a coward who couldn't accept reality. Nietzsche's explanation of the master and slave theme is instead based on power, rather than orderliness."}

A strong high pressure area began building in the central and Southern United States. That allowed the temperatures to soar to almost every day from June to September. This high pressure system acted as a cap on the atmosphere. That prevented thunderstorm development and caused severe drought conditions. But the heat wave broke when the dying Hurricane Allen stopped the weather pattern.\nThe heat wave and drought led a number of cities in the Midwest and South to have record heat. In Kansas City, Missouri, the high temperature was only below twice. In the same city, the high temperature hit 17 days in a row. In Memphis, Tennessee, the high temperature reached on Sunday, July 13.

The field of anthropology has largely been based off of examining racial differences. Despite centuries of scientific racism, the biological concept of race has been debunked.\nHistory of race.\nThe term race often refers to skin color, which is direct relation to latitudinal location on planet. Solar radiation from the sun effects melanin production, which is the pigment in the skin that determines skin color. Groups closer to the equator typically produce more melanin, and thus have darker skin to protect from the increased solar radiation. \nCharles Darwin(1809-1882), known for his theory of natural selection, believed that there were distinct races, and that human evolution was progressive, meaning that the white races were thought to be more evolved than the black races as he stated in his The Decent of Man. Carl Linnaeus(1707-1778), who created the binomial nomenclature to show the relations between species of animals, put humans into the order primates, and thought that there were four human sub-species- European Whites, American Reds (Native Americans), Asian Browns, and African Blacks. \nThe formation of anthropology.\nThe field of anthropology is the study of humans through time. There are now four main subfields- Physical (biological) anthropology, cultural anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics. Anthropology was originally created in attempt to understand human differences. Samuel Morton (1799-1851), originally a physician and viewed as the first physical anthropologist, collected human skulls. He measured them and attempted to compare the sizes of five different human racial groups, trying to prove that whites had the biggest brain sizes and therefore were the most intelligent. Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) believed that traits such as a strong work ethic and morality were traits that could be passed down genetically, from parent to child. Spencer coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" and used those ideas to justify poor work conditions and racism. All of these ideas led to the rise of scientific racism where scholars used science to back up their racist ideologies, although the science they used was later proved to be wrong. Francis Galton (1822-1911), was an English anthropologist who was interested in the hereditary of intelligence and coined the term eugenics, which was the idea of only mating people with desirable traits to increase the occurrence of those traits. It was thought that since nonwhites were less intelligent, and that you could breed for higher intelligence, whites should not mate with nonwhites. Laws were passed that made interracial marriages illegal.\nThese ideas persisted for a long time, and some even still today. Ideas slowly began to change throughout the 1900s. Lewis Henry Morgan (1818-1881) was an American Anthropologist who was interested in kinship systems and social evolution. He became deeply interested in the Native American populations, concerned about their struggles with colonialism and oppression. He was adopted by the Seneca Native American tribe, and worked closely with Ely S. Parker, a Seneca member to write \"The League of the Iroquois\". While Morgan gave Parker some initial credit for his contribution to the publication, Morgan still often took credit for the work, and even at times pushed harmful Native American Stereotypes. Sir Edward Burnett Tylor (1832-1917) was a British Anthropologist, and often cited as the founder of cultural anthropology. He introduced the theory of progressive evolution, the idea that cultures evolved from primitive to modern, and that those considered primitive were just less evolved peoples than the western people who had modern culture, similar to the ideas of Darwin. Earnest Hooton (1887-1954) was an American Physical anthropologist, who spent his career advocating for eugenics and attempting to separate races into categories based on skeletal features and measurements. He sat on a Committee on the Negro, which studied the anatomy of Black people to try and prove that they were an inferior subgroup. \nDebunking the race concept.\nFranz Boas (1858-1942) was a German born American Anthropologist. He spent a lot of his career fighting against and working to deconstruct scientific racism. He was one of first to challenge the classification of human variation. He also took on a lot of minority students, both students of color and women, encouraging them in their projects. However, Boas did not always seem to grasp the of the lives of those he worked with who were trying to be scholars and to be activists for their people. And he wasn't always willing to collaborate with others (especially women) who challenged his ideas. However, Boas produced many well-known anthropologists who continued to carry on his ideas and legacy. \nSince then, race has been proved to be a social construct. There is no biological basis for race, but humans have created race as a classification to justify centuries of slavery, genocide, and oppression. Differences in races should really be attributed to geography. Many differences in skeletal morphology, skin color, and even disease, are all rooted in geographical differences. \nRegardless of the progress that has been made within the field of anthropology regarding race, the contributions and work of many black and indigenous anthropologists have been overlooked. Scholars such as W.E.B DuBois, Antenor Firmin, Zora Neale Hurston, Ely Parker, and Francis LeFresche are just a few. \nModern anthropology and race.\nDespite what we now know about race, anthropology still relies on the physical description of race. Forensic anthropology, which analyzes human remains with the intention of aiding criminal investigations still uses the descriptor of race to describe and match missing persons. The use of race still persists, because while we know that there is no real biological basis for race, there is a social basis for race, which must be acknowledged. We can use the genetic variation between populations of different geographical locations, known as ancestry, to determine possible race. This aids in finding missing persons and suspects, and matching missing persons to remains.\nReferences.\nMachine"}

The bowler is allowed to deliver the ball underarm, but if they do so, the ball must bounce beyond the underarm line. Teams may have less than 11 players."}

It was located in the city with the same name. It housed about 1000 of the 3900 prisoners of war captured at Tsingtao, China, in 1914. Today, the camp is considered special, because of the liberal rules it had. Many of the prisoners were not professional soldiers, but had other jobs before the war. The commander of the camp, Matsue Toyohisa, saw this, and allowed the prisoners many liberties. One of these liberties was that they were allowed to follow courses to improve their skills. That way, Hermann Richard Hansen directed a choir and an orchestra of prisoners, to perform Beethoven's 9th symphony. This was the first performance of the symphony in Japan and in Asia. When the camp closed in 1920, 63 people chose to stay in Japan."}

They help describe the anatomy of animals (including humans). They describe standard positions on an animal. They use Latin and Greek words.\nIntroduction.\nStandard terms let all biological and medical scientists, veterinarians, doctors and anatomists to communicate information about animal bodies and their organs. Much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans (Gray's Anatomy) and animals\nFor humans, and other animals which stand on two feet (bipeds), terms used are different from animals which stand on four (quadrupeds). Humans are described in the standard anatomical position, which is standing up with arms outstretched. So, what is on \"top\" of a human is the head, whereas the \"top\" of a dog may be its back, and the \"top\" of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side. Unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone (invertebrates), because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry.\nMain terms.\nSuperior and inferior.\nSuperior means above; inferior means below. In humans it means the head and feet. In animals it means the back and the underneath.\nAnterior and posterior.\nAnterior means the front; posterior means the back.\nMedial and lateral.\nMedial means the midline; lateral means the sides. The terms \"left\" and \"right\" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives dexter (right) and sinister (left).\nProximal and distal.\nThe terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to, or distant from, the main mass of the body. Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.\n\"Proximal and distal\" are frequently used when describing appendages, such as fins, tentacles, and limbs. \nThis terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore referring to the atomic position of molecules in a given compound.\nCentral and peripheral.\nCentral and peripheral refer to the distance towards and away from the centre of something.\nCentral describes something close to the centre. For example, the great vessels run centrally through the body; many smaller vessels branch from these.\nPeripheral describes something further away from the centre of something. For example, the arm is peripheral to the body.\nSuperficial and deep.\nDeep describes something further away from the surface of the organism.\nSuperficial describes something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in skin, the epidermis is superficial to the subcutis.\nDorsal and ventral.\nThese two terms, used in anatomy and embryology, describe something at the back (\"dorsal\") or front/belly (\"ventral\") of an organism.\nThe dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.\nThe ventral surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.\nFor example, in a fish, the pectoral fins are dorsal to the anal fin, but ventral to the dorsal fin.\nCranial and caudal.\nSpecific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:\nFor example, in horses, the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.\nThese terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine. \nIn humans, \"cranial\" and \"cephalic\" are used to refer to the skull, with \"cranial\" being used more commonly. The term \"rostral\" is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term \"caudal\" is used more in embryology and only occasionally used in human anatomy. This is because the brain is at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is in the anterior part. Thus, the \"rostrocaudal axis\" refers to a C shape (see image above)."}

Her magic wand is an umbrella, and with it Manu will have to learn to study magic, fulfill wishes and face the witch Valkyrie who always tries to dominate the kingdom with some crazy plan.

She has all the qualities needed to become a great Fairy Godmother: she is brave, impetuous, she has a great heart and plenty of energy to get her hands dirty and help others. However, Manu thinks he already knows everything. Her excitement and anxiety is so great that she wants to take action right away. She runs over and ends up taking actions that only make the situation worse and then she has to double her efforts to correct her mistakes.\nJo\u00e3o - Jo\u00e3o is paranoid, afraid and scared.

Her ambition has no limits: she wants to become the best witch of all time. In other words: she wants to be the worst witch of all time.

It has thousands of creams and potions for skin and hair.\nGranny Olivia - Manu's grandmother. She is a retired and experienced fairy, who usually helps her granddaughter with some spell problems.\nAlfredo - Manu's father. He is a naive and clumsy man who is always in a good mood.

Today, it is part of the Suez Canal, which connects it to the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. It is connected to the Small Bitter Lake (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u0631\u0649; transliterated: al-Buhayrah al-Murra as-Sughra), through which the canal also runs. Before the canal was built (1869), the site was a dry salt valley or basin. Even the ancient Pyramid Texts mention it. Ships traveling through the Suez Canal use the Great Bitter Lake as a \"passing lane\", where they can change their position in line or turn around.\nSalinity.\nThe place where the Great Bitter Lake is located used to be a dry salt valley. This still influences the salinity of the lake. Starting with the Six-Day War (1967), the Suez Canal was closed for eight years. During this time, the salinity of the lake increased a lot. It depends on how much seawater flows into it from the Red and the Mediterranean seas. Even when the canal is open, the Great Bitter Lake has a salinity level \"more than twice\" the level of the sea. While this makes it difficult for plant life to exist there, many species (of crabs, for example) migrate from the Red Sea through the area.\nAs the Suez canal has no locks, sea water flows freely into the lake from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In general, north of the lakes, the current changes seasonally, it flows to the north in winter, and south in summer. South of the lakes, the current is tidal, changing with the tides in the Red Sea.\nMany fish migrate from south to north through the canal. This is known as Lessepsian migration. It means that certain Red Sea species have come to colonize the eastern Mediterranean.\nQuincy Agreement.\nOn 14 February 1945, in the last year of World War II, Great Bitter Lake was the site of the Quincy Agreement. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, directly after the Yalta Conference with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, met Saudi Arabia's King Abdulaziz on board the naval cruiser USS \"Quincy\".\nPresident Roosevelt's interpreter was U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Bill Eddy, who recorded the men's conversation in his book \"FDR Meets Ibn Saud\". The meeting is the subject of a BBC documentary by Adam Curtis, \"called Bitter Lake\" (2015).\nYellow Fleet.\nDuring the Six-Day War in 1967, the canal was closed. Egypt kept it closed until 1975, trapping 15 ships in the lake. These ships became known as the \"Yellow Fleet\", because of the desert sands which soon covered their decks. The crews of the ships would eventually organize, share resources, and later set up their own post office and stamp. Two German-flagged ships eventually sailed out of the canal on their own power. Stranded cargo included various perishables (such as eggs and fruit), T-shirts, and a load of toys destined for Woolworth's."}

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 9, 1999. The episode is about Chris getting kicked out of the Boy Scouts (the episode calls it \"Youth Scouts\"). Peter drives the family to Scout headquarters to get Chris back in. During a rest stop at a Native American casino, Lois gambles away the family car. Peter pretends to be a member of the tribe in an attempt to get the car back, and is sent on a vision quest to prove his heritage, giving him and Chris an opportunity to bond.\nStory.\nChris wants to leave the Youth Scouts but does not want to tell his father Peter. Chris is later kicked out of the Youth Scouts. Peter takes Chris and the family to Manhattan, where the headquarters of the Youth Scouts is. Brian stays at the house and watches \"One Day at a Time\". He becomes less smart after watching some episodes. \nPeter needs to go to a bathroom, so they go to a Native American casino. Lois gets a gambling addiction and loses the family's car. Peter tries to get the car back by pretending he is a Native American. The Indians who work at the casino tell Peter to go on a vision quest to show that he really is a Native American. Chris goes with Peter into the wilderness. This is so that he can tell Peter he wants to draw instead of be with the Youth Scouts. Peter becomes so hungry in the wilderness that he starts to see talking trees. Fonzie appears in the sky and gets Peter to see Chris as a good artist. Peter and Chris go back to the casino and get their car back. At the end of the episode, the family talks about what Native Americans, Mexicans, and Swedes have achieved in life. Peter then says that \"Canada sucks.\"\nProduction.\n\"The Son Also Draws\" was written by Ricky Blitt. Niel Affleck is the director of the episode. Alex Borstein (voice actor of Lois) helped write the episode. Seth MacFarlane (creator of the show) thought she was helpful on writing for what Lois does in the episode. The part of the story where Lois loses the family's car was based on the movie \"Lost in America\". The part with Peter trying to be an Indian to get the family car back is similar to real events. People say that they are 1/64th of a Native American so that they can get money from casinoes. Suzie Plakson, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Tatasciore, Wally Wingert, Bobby Slayton, Butch Hartman, and Patrick Bristow were guest stars for the episode.\nReception.\nAhsan Haque from IGN thought that the episode was not an \"instant classic\" like the other episodes of the first season, but is \"still quite strong\". He said that the episode did not have as many \"laugh out loud moments\" but has more \"bolder\" humor. Robin Pierson of \"The TV Critic\" thought that the episode was \"very poor\" and that the story was not focused.

Even today, blackcurrant is called \"Vinb\u00e4r\" (\"wine-berry\") in Swedish. In the north of Germany the name Weinbeere has been used to refer to blackcurrant, since the Middle Ages.The terms Meertr\u00fcbli or Tr\u00fcbli (small grape) is still present in some southern German dialects, to refer to blackcurrant.\nThe first reference outside the Sagas is that of Adam of Bremen (1076) in his Gesta Hammaburgensis. He wrote: \"\"Praeterea unam adhuc insulam recitavit a multis in eo repertam occeano, quae dicitur Winland, eo quod ibi vites sponte nascantur, vinum optimum ferentes. Nam et fruges ibi non seminatas habundare, non fabulosa opinione, sed certa comperimus relatione Danorum.\" This can be translated as: \"In addition [the king of the Danes] reports on one of many islands in the ocean, which is called Winland, because vines grow there wild, which produce wine. That there are fruit in abundance which have non been [planted], we have not known from an incredible rumour, but from the report of the Danes.\"\""}

Jay Z signed her under his label Roc-A-Fella records. In the same year, she released her debut album, titled \u2018Roc-A-Fella Records Presents Teairra Mari\u2019, which turned out to be a major debacle.

A few years later, she got another chance to redeem her career with the single \u2018Hunt 4 U\u2019, and its success enabled her to approach studios to produce her second album. It was eventually released with the title \u2018At that Point\u2019. She embarked into acting in 2009 with the film \u2018The Magnificent Cooly-T\u2019. Thereafter, she appeared in another film \u2018Lottery Ticket\u2019 in 2010. She has also released some mix tapes featuring some well known artists of this era and has tasted success with her latest album, \u2018Night Shift\u2019 which was released in 2017.\nPersonal life.\nAccording to Teairra, she was in an-again-off-again relationship for nine years with Brandy Norwood's brother Ray J. In September 2014, Ray J claimed that Teairra was physically abusive to him during their relationship. In 2011, Teairra was arrested in Beverly Hills, California for allegedly assaulting a police officer. In July 2015, Mari was charged with battery after her Uber driver alleged that she punched him and stole his phone charger after he originally declined to let her charge her phone in his car. Nonetheless, the court case had ended in a mistrial when the judge had to excuse himself due to illness in early 2017."}

They lay on the path of tropical rainfall. As vegetable matter from these forests decayed, enormous deposits of peat accumulated, which later changed into coal. Now those continents are wide apart, but they have the coalfields which those ancient forests left behind.\nMuch of the carbon in the peat deposits produced by coal forests came from photosynthetic splitting of carbon dioxide. This released oxygen into the atmosphere. This increased the oxygen level, perhaps as high as about 35%. This had the effect of making the air more easily breathable by animals with limitrd respiratory systems. This may explain the size of \"Meganeura\" compared to modern dragonflies.\nThe coal forests covered tropical Euramerica (Europe, eastern North America, northwesternmost Africa) and China. Eventually, climate change devastated these tropical rainforests. The so-called Carboniferous rainforest collapse was caused by a cooler drier climate which broke up the rainforest ecosystem. The cause of this change was mountain uplift, no doubt caused by the continental plates squeezing against each other. During most of the rest of Carboniferous times, the coal forests were restricted to North America (such as the Appalachian and Illinois coal basins) and central Europe.\nAt the very end of the Carboniferous period, the coal forests underwent a resurgence, expanding mainly in eastern Asia, notably China. They never recovered fully in Euramerica. The Chinese coal forests continued to flourish well into Permian times. "}

In the late 19th century, both gold and iron ore were found and mined, leading to the region's rise as the steel industry developed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. From 1900-1918 the Helen Mine had the highest production of iron ore of any mine in Canada.\nThe township includes the smaller communities of Michipicoten and Michipicoten River, which are small port settlements on the shore of Lake Superior. These names are from the Ojibwe term for the river.\nDemographics.\nPopulation trend:\nModern politics in Wawa.\nThe municipal council is made up of one mayor and four councillors. The current mayor is Ron Rody. Councillors Tamara Liddle, Bill Chiasson, James Neufeld and Yvan Besner were elected on October 27, 2014 for four years. After James Neufeld resigned on April 27, 2015, Matthew Morrison was appointed to fill the empty seat on August 10, 2015.

Both were punished by town council. After the 2018 elections, Ron Rody was victorious as mayor and the following councillors were elected: Bill Chiasson, Mitch Hatfield, Robert Reece, and Pat Tait.\nTourist attractions and notable events.\nThe community is known for its 8.5-metre (28-foot) metal statue of a Canada goose, which was built in 1960, and was dedicated to the community in 1961. Wawa takes its name from the Ojibwe word for \"wild goose\", \"wewe\". Wawa was called wild goose in \"The Song of Hiawatha.\" On July 5, 2010, the Canada Post made a commemorative stamp of the Wawa Goose as part of its Roadside Attractions collection. On July 1, 2017, a new Wawa Goose was made to replace the second aging goose.\nThe town is also known for snowmobiling and sport fishing. The Voyageur Hiking Trail passes through the town.

More commonly, a group of animals has an area that they use but do not necessarily defend. This is called their home range. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, and in the overlap areas, the groups tend to avoid each other. \nMany animals use vocalisations to advertise their territory. These are short-term signals given only when the animal is present. The sound can travel long distances and through various habitats.

Hypergamy is usually associated with women. Some sociologists believe that harems formerly existed because of female hypergamy. Some analysts also believe that people have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors because of female hypergamy.\nFor the better part of human history, women simply didn\u2019t have the option, access, or legal rights in many places in the world to have agency over their own welfare and to create financial independence. So, they relied on a 'good marriage' to secure their (and their children\u2019s) overall prosperity and prospects.\nWhile many Western societies have progressed to promote gender equality in the past century\u2014attempting to creating equal career, educational, and financial opportunities for women\u2014there's still a large gender pay gap. For example, in the United States, women are paid roughly 82 cents for every dollar a man makes for the same job, and the disparity is even greater for women of color, according to the American Association of University Women."}

Some people incorrectly call a Welsh Sheepdog a Welsh Collie - usually 'Welsh Collie' is used for a cross between a Welsh Sheepdog and a Border Collie, which is often a milder dog and easier to manage than the pure breed.\nLike other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are different in build, colour and size. Welsh Sheepdogs are the collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations. The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip. They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets.\nOver many decades the Welsh Sheepdog has mostly been replaced for working sheep in Wales by the Border Collie, a standardised breed. However, in more recent years, efforts have been made to keep the Welsh Sheepdog as a variety.\nWelsh Sheepdogs are usually \"loose-eyed\", not scaring the stock with their eyes like the \"\" Border Collie. They are able to work freely without being under human control. Welsh Sheepdogs are most often used for herding sheep, but also work cattle, goats, and even horses and pigs. They were often in the past used as a droving dog to take cattle and sheep to markets in Britain.\nHealth.\nThe Welsh Sheepdog is generally healthy, but can be infected by things most other herding breeds are infected by, such as:\n\u2022 Atopic Dermatitis, which seems to be more common indoors for this breed. It causes irritation to the dog's skin.\n\u2022 Collie Eye Anomaly, which is very common with collie breeds. It causes sight loss.\n\u2022 Epilepsy, a brain disorder which causes seizures.\n\u2022 Hip dysplasia, which makes the hip go weak. Mostly in growing dogs.\n\u2022 Diabetes, which is not listed for the dog breed being more likely to get, but there are increasing numbers of this. It causes weight loss, and makes the dog urinate more.\nFood levels.\nThe Welsh Sheepdog needs about three cups of dry food each day, which costs between $1.20 and $1.40. The monthly cost of this is about $35, but this can go to $45."}

Males are around tall at the shoulders while females are around tall.\nHistory of the Bearded Collie.\nThe Bearded Collie's history is mostly fact and false. Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, traded some grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514 and brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move the sheep. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded several sheep for several dogs. The Polish sheepdogs were bred with local Scottish dogs to produce the Bearded Collie. It is generally agreed that Mrs. G. Olive Willison founded the modern Bearded Collie in 1944 with her brown female, Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie was meant to be a Shetland Sheepdog, but Mrs. Willison was given a Bearded Collie by accident. She was so interested by the dog that she wanted to begin breeding, so she began looking for a male dog for Jeannie. While walking along the beach, Mrs. Willison met a man who was emigrating from Scotland; she became the owner of his grey dog, David, who became Bailie (also anglicized as Bailey) of Bothkennar. Bailie and Jeannie of Bothkennar are the makers of the modern breed; there are only a few other blood lines, preserved in large part by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge (Sallen) and Mrs. Betty Foster (Bredon). These are based on Turnbull's Blue\u2014a Bearded Collie from working stock, registered in ISDS when ISDS still registered non-Border Collies. He breeded three litters of Bearded Collies. The breed became popular during the last half of the 20th century\u2014helped, in part, by Potterdale Classic at Moonhill, a Bearded Collie who won Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded Collie Club celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2005. The bearded collie is also good natured and is good as a family pet and a working dog and a show dog.\nHealth.\nMortality.\nThe average longevity (the age at which half of the dogs has died and half is still alive) of Bearded Collies from recent UK and USA/Canada surveys (the average of all surveys is 12.8 years); Beardies in the UK surveys lived longer (average ~13.4 years) than the USA/Canada bearded collies. (median 12.0 years). Most breeds have average longevities between 10 and 13 years and most breeds similar in size to Bearded Collies have average longevities between 11 and 13 years, so the lifespan of Bearded Collies appears to be on the higher compared with other breeds (at least in the UK). Individual dogs may die much earlier or later than the average. In a 1996 USA/Canada survey, 32% of Beardies died (including accidental deaths) before the age of nine; however, 12% lived longer than 14 years. The oldest of the 278 deceased dogs in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey died at 19.5 years; the age at death of the oldest dog in the USA/Canada survey was not reported.\nThe highest causes of death among Beardies in the UK are old age (26%), cancer (19%), cerebrovascular disease (9%), and chronic kidney failure (8%). The highest causes of death among Beardies in the US and Canada are old age (18%), cancer (17%), kidney failure (8%), cerebrovascular disease (4%) and hypoadrenocorticism (4%). These are similar to eachother.\nMorbidity.\nBearded Collie owners in the UK said that the most common health issues among living dogs were musculoskeletal\u2014mostly arthritis and cruciate ligament rupture (CLR)\u2014gastrointestinal (primarily colitis and diarrhea) and urologic diseases. Beardie owners in the US and Canada reported that the most common health problems were hypothyroidism, cancer, Addison's disease, arthritis and skin problems. Morbidity in the two studies is not easily compared, however; the UK report grouped diseases, while the USA/Canada report used more detailed conditions.\nMore existing breed causes of death for the Bearded Collie include: Skin conditions, such as pemphigus foliaceous and black skin disease, follicular dysplasia, musculoskeletal conditions such as congenital elbow luxation, ocular conditions, such as corneal dystrophy, cataract and generalized progressive retinal atrophy (GPRA).\nHypoadrenocorticism.\nHypoadrenocorticism (also known as Addison's disease) is a disease in Bearded Collies, although the inheritance is not known. It occurs when the adrenal cortex produces less then needed numbers of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid hormones. It affects approximately 2\u20133.4% of Bearded Collies in the USA/Canada, and causes the death of at least 1% of Bearded Collies in the UK. These are higher percentages than for the average dog population (0.1%), and hypoadrenocorticism causes a disproportionate number of deaths among young dogs. Early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Symptoms include unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to tolerate stress. Untreated, hypoadrenocorticism can cause death. Thankfully, with medication, most dogs can live a normal life."}

It is about 36 cm tall and weighs between 4 and 6 kg. Its fur is gray with places that are brown and some stripes. Its hairs can be 5 cm long. Young cats have lighter fur than adult cats. Young Andean cats look like pampas cats, which live in the same places as the Andean cat.\nIt eats many different kinds of small animals, for example lizards and birds. Its main food is the mountain vizcacha. Its main food used to be the mountain chinchilla, but most of the chinchillas are dead now and the ones that are a live do not live where the Andean cat lives. This cat likes to live in rocky, open places more than it likes forests.\nThe Andean cat is in danger of dying out because humans are using or want to use the land that it lives on, breaking its living space into small pieces so that it has to cross roads and other human areas to get from place to place. It is endangered because many of the animals it eats are gone. It is endangered because humans like to catch it for its fur. It is also endangered because the Andean cat and its body parts is important to traditional medicine in Peru and in religious ceremonies for some of the indigenous people of the Andes."}

Singh for Sony Entertainment Television. The series began on 5 October 1995. One of the episodes of the first season, Abhinetri, telecasted in 1998, generated a very high TRP for the show. The episodes of first, second and fifth seasons were half-hourly, while episodes of third, fourth and sixth seasons were one-hourly. The sixth season was premiered on 18 February 2015, featuring Shakti Anand and ended on 4 August 2015.\nPlot.\nThe first season was mostly a crime genre with infrequent episodes on the supernatural. After the first season, each story focused on a different aspect of paranomal activity, such as ghosts, zombies, phantoms, undead persons, possessed objects and witches and wizards.\nSeries overview.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSeason 1 (1995\u20132001).\n\"Aahat\" was first shot in 1994 as a suspense thriller, and began broadcast on 5 October 1995, each story being divided across two episodes. The season aired on Thursday nights, later changing it to every Friday nights. \nSeason 2 (2004\u20132005).\nDue to the popularity of the first season, Sony TV decided to bring back the series in its second season. The second season aired on Friday nights. The episode format was same as of the first season. This time the season failed to gain TRP ratings.\nThe third season was titled as \"Aahat: Dahshat Ki Teesri Dastak\" (English: \"An approaching sound: The Third Coming of Horror\"). The season aired on Saturday nights, each story being shown in a single episode. This time too the season didn't manage to gain TRP ratings and the season was shut down soon.\nSeason 4 (2009\u20132010).\nThe fourth season was titled \"Aahat: The All New Series\", which aired on every Friday and Saturday nights. In the season, Durjan who was the head of Paranormal And Supernatural Activities Research used to collect powers from the spirits for his boss. He sends Harsh (Chaitanya Choudhury), Raghav (Vishal Gandhi) and Yamini (Krystle D'Souza) to deal with a new supernatural power every week with the story being divided into two episodes. The season had three crossover episodes with the series \"CID\". Once in November 2009, second time in February 2010 and third time in June 2010. This time the season managed to gain high TRP ratings and was declared a hit. It is one of the most popular seasons of Aahat.\nSeason 5 (2010).\nDue to the huge popularity of the fourth season, Sony TV decided to telecast the series four days a week. The fifth season aired on every Monday to Thursday nights. Every week, two stories were telecast, each story being divided across two episodes. But this idea didn't take off; the TRP ratings dropped once again and the channel had to shut down the series on 25 November 2010.\nTo celebrate 15 years of the series, this season featured a 16 - episode arc titled \"Maut Ka Khel\" (English: \"The Game of Death\") which aired starting 20 September 2010. This was heavily inspired by the 1999 Hollywood horror film House On Haunted Hill. The storyline follows celebrities (Sidharth Shukla, Roshni Chopra, Aashka Goradia, Vivan Bhatena, Gautam Rode, Ketki Dave, Tanaaz Irani, Bakhtiyaar Irani, Aryan Vaid, Bobby Darling, Karishma Tanna, Sanjeet Bedi and Shahbaz Khan) who lived in a 200-year-old haunted house.\nSeason 6 (2015).\nThe first episode of the sixth season premiered on 18 February 2015. Initially, the series was aired twice a week on every Wednesday and Thursday nights. The first episode of the series had gained a TRP rating of 2.9. Due to high ratings, the channel decided to telecast the season four days on every Monday to Thursday nights. But after a couple of weeks, the TRP ratings dropped, and the channel had to shut down the season on 4 August 2015.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nThe first five seasons of the series received positive response but response for the sixth season was quite mixed. Vineeta Kumar of \"India TV\" stated, \"As against everybody's expectations, \"Aahat\" (season 6) doesn't seem that impressive.\"\nSweta Kaushal of \"Hindustan Times\" stated, \"The new episode of \"Aahat\" (season 6) does not scare at all and lives up to all the comic cliches that Indian horror shows have been following till date. At best, it is hilarious.\"\nRatings.\nVineeta Kumar of \"India TV\" gave the sixth season 2/5 stars, and further stated, \"For all those who would be expecting grand with the elements of horror and spook in it, \"Aahat\" has come with a slight disappointment.\"\nSweta Kaushal of \"Hindustan Times\" giving the same ratings to the sixth season, further stated, \"The new episode shows women with bad make-up as the ghosts.\"\nAwards.\nFireworks Productions was nominated for Best Continuing TV Programme and for Best Thriller/Horror Show Of The Year of Indian Telly Awards in 2002. Sujit Pattnaik and Tanmoy Ghosh won Indian Television Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects in 2010, while Himanshu, Yogen and Kamal were nominated for the same category of the same award in 2005 and 2012, however, winning in 2011."}

Ngwane was born the son of Mbandzeni and his mother was Labotsibeni Mdluli. He ascended to the throne after a short regency of Queen Mother Tibati Nkambule. He was only 16 years old when he became king. His royal capital was at Zombodze while the Queen Mother's residence was at Lobamba. Ngwane became the king after the Swaziland convention of 1894. This had led to the classification of Swaziland as a protected state of the South African Republic which was then led by President Paul Kruger. During this time Swaziland had a partial Dutch administration in parallel to Ngwane's administration. The Dutch or European for European interests and Ngwane as head and authority of the Swazi nation. An annual payment was made to Ngwane and Labotsibeni while they were in office from taxes collected and from contributions from concessionaires and taxes. Ngwane's rule was short. In 1899 the Anglo-Boer war began, and brought to an end the Dutch or Boer partial administration of Swaziland and hence gave way to independence. However Mahlokohla died on 10 December of that year while dancing incwala. This was hid from the nation until the ceremony was over. Ngwane was succeeded by his four-month-old son Nkhotfotjeni and his wife Lomawa Ndwandwe. His mother Labotsibeni who had been very influential during his reign continued as queen regent until Sobhuza was crowned in 1921. Ngwane's reign gave way to a stable territory surrounded by conflicting states. Today Mahlokohla is named for one of the main streets, \"Mahlokohla Street\" in Swaziland's capital Mbabane."}

Ingwenyama Mbandzeni was the son of Mswati II and Nandzi Nkambule. His mother the wife of King Mswati had died when he was still very young. Mbandzeni ascended to the throne after his half brother Ludvonga II died before he could become the king. Ludvonga's death resulted in his mother Inkhosikati Lamgangeni adopting Mbandzeni who was motherless as her son, thus making him King and her the Queen mother of Swaziland. His royal capital was at Mbekelweni. During his kingship Mbandzeni, granted many mining, farming, trading and administrative concessions to white settlers from Britain and the Transvaal. These concessions granted with the help of Offy Sherpstone eventually led to the conventions of 1884 and 1894, which reduced the overall borders of Swaziland and later made Swaziland a protectorate of the South African Republic. During a period of concessions preceded by famine around 1877 some of the tindvunas (governors) from within Swaziland like Mshiza Maseko and Ntengu kaGama Mbokane were given permission by King Mbandzeni to relocate to farms towards the Komati River, Mshiza Maseko later settled in a place called eLuvalweni, where he was later buried. Mbandzeni, still in command of a large Swazi army of more than 15000 men aided the British in defeating Sekhukhune in 1879 and preventing Zulu incursion into the Transvaal during the same year. As a result, he guaranteed his country's independence and international recognition despite the Scramble for Africa which was taking place at the time. Mbandzeni died after an illness in 1889 and is quoted to have said in his deathbed \"the Swazi kingship dies with me\". He was buried at the royal cemetery at Mbilaneni alongside his father and grandfather Sobhuza I. Mbandzeni was succeeded by his young son Mahlokohla and his wife Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli after a 5 year regency of Queen Tibati Nkambule. Today a number of buildings and roads in Swaziland are named after Mbandzeni. Among these the Mbandzeni house in Mbabane and the Mbandzeni Highway to Siteki are named after him."}

He made Eswatini much larger.\nMswati was the son of Sobhuza I and Tsandzile Ndwandwe (known as 'LaZidze) who after ruling as Queen Mother became Queen Regent after the death of her son. When Sobhuza died, Mswati inherited the kingdom. At that time, it was from present day Barberton in the north and included the Nomahasha district in Mozambique. Mswati's became a strong military power after Mswati and his brothers Fokoti, Somcuba and Malambule stopped fighting each other.\nWhen Mswati's armies attacked other Bantu armies or nations, they stole cattle and captured people instead of trying to make the other people's territory part of their kingdom. Around this time, the Trekboers became the first Europeans to meet any Swazis. \nMswati made Swazi territory much larger than it is today. There were military outposts and royal village outposts such as Mbhuleni, on the upper Komati River at the foot of the Mkongomo Mountains, south of Badplaas, Mekemeke which is east of the Mbayiyane Mountains, situated east of Mantibovu (Low\u2019s Creek). The death of Mswati II in July 1868 ended the era of Swazi conquest, territorial expansion and resulted in unification of various people into one nation."}

Blanching foods helps reduce the loss of quality over time.\nPeople usually use blanching to treat food before freezing, drying, or canning\u2014heating vegetables or fruits to inactivate enzymes, change texture and remove the peel. Blanching is also used to preserve color, flavor, and nutritional value. The benefits of blanching include removing pesticide residues and killing of microorganisms. The disadvantages of blanching can include leaching of nutrients that dissolves in water and the production of effluent.\nUses.\nBlanching is a process mainly used to inactivate enzymes that cause browning as well as changes in texture and off-flavors. Blanching is used to peel fruits, vegetable, and nut as steam peeling produces less environmental pollution.\nBlanching is also used to kill microorganisms, remove pesticide and toxic residues, surface cleaning, removing damaged seeds or foreign materials and killing parasites and their eggs.\nTechnology.\nTraditionally, blanching is done using either a water bath or saturated steam. In both methods, the food is heated for a short period of time and then dropped into either cold water or cold air to quickly stop the heating process. At the industrial level, foods move on a conveyor belt through preheating, holding, and cooling systems.\nSteam blanching systems inject hot air onto food as it passes through the blanching system on a conveyor belt. This method reduces the leaching of water-soluble compounds from the product. It is more energy-efficient. This reduced heat exposure preserves color, flavor, and overall quality of the food.\nEmerging technologies include ohmic, infrared, microwave, and radio frequency blanching.\nTthe times and temperatures are not enough to effectively destroy all microorganisms.\nA limitation to hot water blanching is the leaching of water-soluble nutrients and the degradation of thermal sensitive compounds. Vitamins, minerals, and other water-soluble compounds, such as proteins, sugars, and flavor compounds, diffuse out of the food and into the water, lowering the overall quality of the food. The degree to which compounds diffuse out of food depends on the food's composition and characteristics, the water to food ratio, the blanching temperature, and other variables. Ascorbic acid, thiamin, and many aromatic compounds are heat-sensitive.\nA complication in the food industry is the production of effluent from water blanching systems. Blanching with reused water can lead to a buildup of water-soluble compounds that are considered pollutants, and therefore must be properly treated before being discharged. This can increase capital costs at the industrial level and has been a main reason for the development of newer blanching technologies."}

During his stay in that city, he would have managed to be recruited by the GRU after looking for and contacting Morris Cohen, an American who joined the Communist Party during the Great Depression and worked as a Soviet spy.\nThe meeting with Cohen must have been between September 1941 and July 1942, before Cohen enlisted in the army and left for the Western Front in Europe.\nPerseus reportedly introduced himself to Cohen as a physicist who had been invited to join the work at Los Alamos research center. By 1942, Perseus was supposedly already working at Los Alamos, being that he would have started sometime at least 18 months before German physicist and also atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, who joined the investigation in mid-1944. However, Perseus appears to have been recruited by the Soviets around the same (or at least a nearby) time as Fuchs.\nAccording to articles published in Russia by \"The New Times\", Perseus would have collaborated with the Soviet government for purely ideological reasons to the point that he refused any financial rewards in exchange for classified information, since he was convinced that the United States would use the atomic bomb against the Soviet Union, claiming that:\nWith Morris Cohen in Europe, his wife, Lona Cohen, took it upon herself to travel to Albuquerque on one or two occasions (depending on the source consulted) to serve as a carrier.\nOnce there, Lona Cohen would have received information allegedly directly from Perseus, and took it to the Soviet consul in New York, Anatoli Yatskov. This information allegedly included crucial details about the Trinity Test, which was detonated in July 1945.\nIn the 1950s, Perseus was supposedly under the control of Rudolf Abel.\nAccording to one source, Perseus was supposedly still alive in 1991.\nPerseus was also allegedly referred by or identified with the code names of \u00abMr. X\u00bb, \u00abYoungster\u00bb, FOGEL, PERS and \u00abMlad\u00bb.\nThis name is also given to a spy at White Sands Missile Range, located further south near Las Cruces, New Mexico.\nAlleged confirmations of existence.\nVladimir Chikov.\nIn April 1991, KGB colonel and public relations officer Vladimir Chikov published articles in the Russian weekly \"The New Times\" in which he commented on the existence of a Russian spy who worked in the Manhattan project under the code name of Perseus, giving details of his recruitment and achievements.\nRegarding the information published by Chikov in \"The New Times\", an article in The Washington Post comments:\nAnatoli Yatskov.\nIn an interview published in 1992, the former Soviet consul in New York, Anatoli Yatskov, confirmed the existence of Perseus, as an important figure among scientists working on the Manhattan project.\nDuring his tenure as consul, Yatskov used the pseudonym Anatoly Yakovlev and served as a Soviet intelligence agent, coordinating atomic spies in the United States.\nYatskov gave details about Perseus' recruitment, how he sent information from New Mexico to New York (through Morris Cohen's wife), and confirmed that the Soviet Union received information from both, Klaus Fuchs and Perseus.\nMorris Cohen and Lona Cohen.\nIn an interview given before his death in 1995, the American-born Soviet spy Morris Cohen confirmed that in addition to Karl Fuchs, there was a second physicist in the Manhattan project who worked as a Soviet spy.\nThe details in Cohen's story coincide with the statements of Colonel Vladimir Chikov a few years ago, such as the recruitment of people close to the Manhattan Project as spies, the existence (suspected by the American intelligence) of an unidentified scientist who collaborated with Soviet intelligence, and the interaction of said scientist with Lona Cohen (Morris Cohen's wife) to transport stolen information.\nAccording to Cohen, by the fall of 1994 there were very few people left in Soviet intelligence (\"two or maybe three\") who knew the real name of the second spy scientist.\nFor her part, shortly before her death in 1992, Lona Cohen had a telephone interview with historian Walter Schneir. In that interview, Lona Cohen confirmed that she had made at least one trip between Albuquerque and New York to transport classified information stolen to the United States, but she could not quite remember who she had interviewed with in New Mexico, saying that it was probably a scientist or physicist.\nReferences in the Venona project.\nThe Venona project was a United States counterintelligence program run by the Signal Intelligence Service that (later became part of the National Security Agency,) started in the Second World War and was active since February 1943 to October 1980.\nThe objective of the program was to intercept and decrypt messages from diplomats, intelligence agencies (such as the NKVD and the KGB), business representatives and other actors of the Soviet government.\nDespite the fact that only a fraction of the messages intercepted by Venona were suitable for decryption, the project left an archive of around 3000 decrypted and translated messages.\nAlthough there is no mention of Perseus in the Venona files, there are references to a spy under the code name PERS or FOGEL. Apparently, at some point the codename PERS was turned into Perseus by mistake.\nPERS was identified in the Venona files as part of the group of four Soviet spies (of which only 3 had been identified) who infiltrated the Manhattan Project. \nDespite the fact that by 2012 a publication by NSA's Center for Cryptologic History described PERS as \"important, but still unidentified\", the references in the Venona files have been questioned or even used to confirm that Perseus never existed.\n4th spy at Los \u00c1lamos.\nFrom the early 1950s till 1995, three Soviet spies had been confirmed to have infiltrated Los Alamos: Klaus Fuchs (German physicist), David Greenglass (military man and brother-in-law of Julius Rosenberg) and Theodore Hall (American physicist).\nFuchs voluntarily confessed to British MI5 authorities in January 1950 and this subsequently lead to Greenglass in June of that same year. Finally, Hall's involvement was not identified until the release of documents from Venona in 1995, a few years before his death in 1999.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, publications like those by Chikov and Yatskov strengthened the theory of a possible fourth spy in Los Alamos, who would have been identified as Perseus (the PERS in the Venona files) or FOGEL.\nAlleged rebuttals of existence.\nPavel Sudoplatov.\nIn 1994 the lieutenant general and Soviet agent Pavel Sudoplatov published a book titled \"Special Tasks\".\nIn the book, Sudoplatov referred to the statements made by Anatoly Yatskov, and stated that he did not remember that code name and, that in his opinion, it could be that Yatskov or his associates created Perseus to cover the true identities of Soviet informants.\nHowever, Sudoplatov also acknowledged that the codename Perseus was used to refer to or cover a number agents and anonymous sources.\nJohn Earl Haynes.\nUnited States Cold War historian John Earl Haynes concluded that Perseus was an invention relying on the research of authors Joseph Albright, Marcia Kunstel and Gary Kern.\nIn an index of false names, pseudonyms, and real names of spies, Haynes notes under the Perseus entry that:\nHowever, Haynes acknowledges that although Perseus was an invention, there must have been a 4th Soviet spy operating in Los Alamos during the development of the Manhattan project in addition to the 3 spies identified until 1995: Klaus Fuchs, David Greenglass and Theodore Hall.\nAlbright and Kunstel.\nIn their book \"Bombshell: The Secret Story of America's Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy\", the authors Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel dedicate the twentieth chapter to Perseus under the title of \"The Perseus Myth\" in which they conclude that the spy never existed.\nAccording to the authors, the KGB may have created Perseus for the purposes of self-promotion, justify its own existence, and even to secure more state funding.\nGary Kern.\nIn 2006 mail that was made public, author Gary Kern explained why he believed Perseus was an invention. Kern believes that Perseus was an extremely risky disinformation operation with multiple objectives, including:\nAlleged identities.\nPhilip Morrison.\nIn April 1999 American scientist, activist and, president of the Federation of American Scientists from 1970 to 2000; Jeremy Stone, published his memoirs under the title \u00ab\"Every Man Should Try\": Adventures of a Public Interest Activist\"\u00bb.\nMotivated by an article in The Washington Post about Vladimir Chikov's publications in Russia, Stone decided to take on the subject, and in his book he disclosed conversations and visits he had with someone he knew personally and only identified with the pseudonym \"Scientist X\" (or \u00abDr. X\u00bb ), and explained why he believed that this \"Scientist X\" was the real Perseus.\nDespite the use of a pseudonym, thanks to the information in the book, the \"Scientist X\" was easily identified as Philip Morrison, a physicist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nMorrison denied the accusation and gave a solid rebuttal against it, noting that:\nOn the other hand, the reasons that led Stone to suspect Morrison were questioned. Namely, those reasons included:\nTo all of the above, Stone accepted Morrison's rebuttal, stating that: \"In the light of these facts, which I certainly cannot contradict, [...] I can only accept your denial that you are Perseus.\"\nFinally, thanks to the controversy raised by the event, several academics and people close to the Federation of American Scientists expressed their wishes for Stone to apologize, and even the idea of calling Stone to present his resignation as head of the Federation.\nOscar Seborer.\nAccording to historian John Earl Haynes and academic Harvey Klehr, thanks to FBI documents that were declassified in the 2010s, they were able to confirm the existence of a suspected fourth spy who they identified as Oscar Seborer.\nSeborer was an American engineer who was drafted into the United States Army in 1942 and, like all his siblings, had sympathy for the Communist Party USA.\nGiven his education as an engineer, Seborer was assigned to the \u00abSpecial Engineer Detachment\u00bb, a program that identified members of the military with specific abilities and funneled them to the Manhattan project.\nHowever, Haynes and Klehr are emphatic that Seborer should not be identified with Perseus, since while Perseus would have been an invention probably based on Theodore Hall, Seborer's life and profile have no relation to the characteristics attributed to Perseus.\nTheodore Hall.\nAccording to historian John Eark Haynes and academic Harvey Klehr, although Perseus never really existed, some aspects of his character were based on or coincide with the American Soviet spy and physicist Theodore Hall. These aspects include:\nBorn in New York City, Hall was an American physicist who was considered a prodigy from an early age and graduate from Harvard University at 18. Concerned about the advance of fascism at the time, Hall developed sympathies for socialism.\nAlthough Haynes and Klehr noted that the agent identified as Perseus (or sometimes as \"Mlad\") has attributes and characteristics that do not match Hall, they still concluded that Perseus must have actually been an invention, the result of a misinformation operation with the goal of protecting Hall, who was still alive in the early 1990s. Which could explain the presence of attributes that coincide between both at the same time of others that do not.\nIn popular culture.\nOn August 19, 2020, Perseus was first referenced in the worldwide teaser trailer for \"\". He was later confirmed as the main antagonist in the game's which is set in the 1980s and flashbacks of the Vietnam War."}
{"id": "808611", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=808611", "title": "Haltlose personality disorder", "text": "Haltlose personality disorder is a mental illness that displays as selfishness, blaming others for the actions they have committed, lacking direction in life and a lack of insight and self-control. They are unable to learn from experience or mistakes in life since they lack any sense of past or future, and are not able to genuinely care about other people. People with Haltlose are also called an unstable psychopath.\nIt is studied in psychiatry, sociology and criminology - and is one of the most common types of psychopathy to end up committing crimes, including violence and murder. Healthier individuals may still focus on either vengeance or sadism. Parents with Haltlose make up the majority of those who sexually molest their own children.\nThe disorder has many things in common with anti-social personality disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD). In some countries, doctors diagnose BPD to describe two sets of behaviors, but doctors in other countries diagnose the one group as BPD and the other group as Haltlose, or some people might have both. Usually people with Haltlose will also have other mental illnesses, such as histrionic personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder or fantasy prone personality.\nSometimes doctors will make a mistake and think it is bipolar. It can also look like epilepsy if combined with alcoholism.\nIt can be very difficult for a doctor to help them become better since they tend to lie to doctors because they are afraid, and their pathological lying can be convincing even though they view it similar to a child and often believe they should be rewarded for having taken the time to invent such a good lie.\nOf all the different types of psychiatric patients, those with Haltlose personality disorder have some of the worst results.\nThe Haltlose will usually need boundaries and controls set by those around them, and \"optimistic\" professionals suggest that marriage to a spouse willing to curtail their behaviors may be sufficient to avoid professional involvement. Their symptoms get worse if they are given independence, whether at home, work or in a prison or hospital.\nCause.\nThe name is based on a German word, \"Haltlos\", which means \"without stability\". In this context it is used for an irresponsible and unstable lifestyle. It appears in the ICD-10 book, but not in the DSM-V book.\nLike other personality disorders, nobody is certain what causes it. There appears to be both genetic and environmental causes, and although it is difficult to identify in children - by adolescence it is typically easy to diagnose. It is believed to be caused by the mother, not the father, both from her own health and also from how she treated the child when they were young.\nIt is equally common in males and females, and doctors must be careful not to wrongly identify a child as Haltlose since many of the symptoms are actually normal for children,such as selfishness, lack of planning and feigning emotions they see others having, and they only suggest a mental illness if they continue at later ages.\nProfessionals disagree on whether the Haltlose are actually unable to understand the difference between good and evil, or if they understand but do not care, or if they deliberately choose evil instead of good.\nUsually people with Haltlose personality disorder stop showing their symptoms almost immediately if they are in a controlled environment, like the army or a psychiatric hospital or prison.\nEffects.\nPeople with Haltlose personality disorder have \"primitive reactions\" to things, and their largest focus is simply on their own survival. They frequently struggle with addictions, such as with drugs or alcohol, and are one of two types of personality disorders that commit the most crimes. They also tend to have abnormal sexual habits, such as BDSM, homosexuality or increased masturbation.\nThey do struggle with addictions, most commonly with alcoholism. They often consume drugs, coffee, tea or medicines in larger quantities than normal. Because they spend so much money, they usually have large debts they cannot pay - and either ask family to pay, ignore, or attempt crime (theft, prostitution, etc) to pay their debts. However many professionals suggest that parents and spouses do not pay such debts, and instead let the Haltlose person's bad decisions lead them to institutionalization where they will be healthier and have more guidance.\nAlthough they often threaten or pretend to commit suicide, suicide pacts or murder suicide, they do not commonly actually do it since they are easily distracted and made happy again. Often their reason for pretending is because they are scared of an approaching consequence for their actions, of even because they like the \"excitement\" of police and hospitals becoming involved. Lobotomy was tested as a possible means to limit their chaotic thinking.\nIt can be very difficult for people to understand them, because they can have \"a number of endearing qualities\" such as appearing naturally charming, plausible, likable or emotionally warm, but they are actually using those as tools to \"conquer\" the people watching them.\nUsually, they do not like science or religion as they control and limit the answers. Often, they are very good at arts like acting in theatres: their lack of memory means that they can easily play new characters and feel very similar to the character they are playing.\nHaving families of their own.\nSome have said that Haltlose patient should be sterilized to prevent them from having children since they are not able to make decisions that would be good for anyone except themselves and they can become \"family tyrants\" while pretending to be victims. Sometimes, governments have even refused them marriage licenses, out of fear that marriage would lead to them having children.\nEven when they are not \"true\" pedophiles, the Haltlose demonstrate an increased risk of sexually molesting children, with as many as 90% of incestuous adult-child molestors being Haltlose. Mothers with Haltlose may push their young daughters to engage in sex with men that the mother wishes she could have herself. They also like to have sex with their own partners in front of the children, rather than hiding the details of their sex life.\nBecause they can have an \"explosive\" temper, domestic violence is common, beatings, death threats, smashing household objects.\nExamples.\nWilly Roloff was a smart Pomeranian serial killer with Haltlose personality disorder, who was executed by guillotine in 1937 after his appeal for mercy to Adolf Hitler was denied.\nThe philosopher Max Scheler had an adult son who was diagnosed as both a Haltlose and Gemutlose psychopath. He was guilty of many crimes over twenty years, and was eventually sent to a concentration camp where it is assumed that he died.\nProblems and solutions.\nAt some times, they will look very positive and responsible and talk about large plans that they intend to accomplish, but they are actually very depressed and cynical most of the time because they are unable to make their plans work since they cannot learn from their mistakes, and they do not have a good sense of time. They will very quickly change from acting very confident and brave, to very sad, angry or afraid when their plans do not work.\nA major source of the problem is that they are not able to remember the past, or think about the future - so every decision is decided only on the basis of the present time. Similarly, if asked to describe themselves, they cannot accurately describe things they felt in the past, because they only know the story they are telling right now.\nBecause they are not capable of planning for the future, and make very bad choices, doctors often decide they need leaders and controls to guide them in every aspect of life. This means they can be very successful when they are in a hospital, prison or school with very strict rules and leadership - because their intelligence is normal, it is just their personality disorder that leads them to trouble.\nSome professionals say the haltlose do not understand warnings, so only punishments work to stop them from doing bad things. But other professionals say that they do not learn any long-term lessons from punishment.\nWhen they feel guilty about something, they become overwhelmed with the fear that there will be consequences or punishment, so they often exaggerate or invent untruthful stories to blame other people, and will pretend that they are a victim or being exploited or held prisoner.\nThey will often pretend to be embarrassed, experience regret or to be submissive, even though these things are not usually real for haltlose personalities. This makes it \"troublesome\" for doctors trying to help them.\nWhen they feel guilty about doing something that has not been noticed yet, they become overwhelmed with the fear that there will be consequences or punishment, so they often begin to exaggerate or invent untruthful stories to blame other people, and will pretend that they are a victim or being exploited or held prisoner. Once caught, the less intelligent haltlose will respond by claiming that their childhood was not good and that current friends or relatives have misled them and caused them to do these bad things. The more intelligent haltlose will instead invent elaborate stories with a lot of false details to misdirect attention from what they have done."}

DARE will use the redshifted 21-cm transition line from neutral hydrogen (1420.00\u00a0MHz emissions) to view and spot the formation of the first glowing objects of the universe.\nAlso, this is the period ending of the Dark Ages of the universe. The orbiter will explore the universe as it was from around 80 million years to 420 million years after the Big Bang. The mission will deliver data of the formation of the first stars, the beginning of black hole accretions, and the reionization of the universe. Computer models of galaxy formation will also be tested.\nThis mission might also add research on dark matter decay. The DARE program will also provide information for developing and deploying lunar surface telescopes that add to exoplanet exploration of nearby stars. It is expected to launch in either 2021 or 2022.\nBackground.\nThe period after recombination occurred but before stars and galaxies was created is called the \"dark ages\". During this time, most of the matter in the universe is neutral hydrogen. This hydrogen has yet to be observed, but there are experiments underway to detect the hydrogen line produced during this era. The hydrogen line is produced when an electron in a neutral hydrogen atom is excited to a state where the electron and proton have aligned spins, or de-excited as the electron and proton spins go from being aligned to anti-aligned. The energy difference between these two hyperfine states is formula_1 electron volts, with a wavelength of 21 centimeters. When neutral hydrogen is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the photons in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the neutral hydrogen and CMB are called to be \"coupled\", and the hydrogen line is not observable. It is only when the two temperatures are not same, or decoupled, that the hydrogen line can be observed.\nTheoretical motivation.\nThe Big Bang produced a hot, dense, nearly homogeneous universe. As the universe expanded and cooled, particles, then nuclei, and finally atoms formed. At a redshift of about 1100, equal to about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, when the primordial plasma filling the universe cooled enough for protons and electrons to combine into neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became optically thin by which photons from this early era no longer interacted with matter. We detect these photons today as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The CMB shows that the universe was still smooth and uniform.\nAfter the protons and electrons combined to produce the first hydrogen atoms, the universe contained a nearly uniform, almost completely neutral, intergalactic medium (IGM) for which the most amount of matter component was hydrogen gas. With no glowing sources present, these are known as the Dark Ages. Theoretical models predict that, over the next few hundred million years, gravity slowly condensed the gas into denser and denser regions, in which the first stars eventually appeared, marking Cosmic Dawn.\nAs more stars formed, and the first galaxies formed, they flooded the universe with ultraviolet photons capable of ionize hydrogen gas. A few hundred million years after Cosmic Dawn, the first stars produced enough ultraviolet photons to re-ionize essentially all the universe's hydrogen atoms. This is called the Reionization era which is the hallmark event of this early generation of galaxies.\nThe beginning of structural complexity in the universe caused a remarkable transformation, but one that we have not yet looked into. By going even farther back than what the Hubble telescope can see, the truly first structures in the universe can be studied. Theoretical models suggest that present measurements are beginning to find the last part of Reionization, but the first stars and galaxies, in the Dark Ages and the Cosmic Dawn, currently lie above our understanding.\nDARE will make the first measurements of the birth of the first stars and black holes and will measure the properties of the invisible stellar objects. Such observations are important for placing current measurements in a proper context, and to understand how the first galaxies grew from earlier generations of structures.\nMission.\nDARE's mission is to measure the shape of the redshifted 21-cm signal over a radio bandpass of 40\u2013120\u00a0MHz, observing the redshift range 11\u201335, which correlate to 80\u2013420 million years after the Big Bang. DARE orbits the Moon for 3 years and takes data above the lunar farside which is the only location in the inner Solar System proven to have no human-generated radio frequency problems.\nThe science instrument is set to a RF quiet spacecraft bus and is made of a three-element radiometer, including electrically-short, tapered, biconical dipole antennas, a receiver, and a digital spectrometer. The smooth frequency response of the antennas and different measurements used for DARE are important in removing the intense cosmic foregrounds so that the weak cosmic 21-cm signal can be detected.\nSimilar projects.\nBesides DARE, are other similar projects are proposed to also study this area such as the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), and the Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA)."}

There are many ways of measuring the center of a triangle, and each has a different name. On an equilateral triangle, every triangle center is the same, but on other triangles, the centers are different. Triangle centers may be inside or outside the triangle. Ancient Greek mathematicians discovered four: the centroid, circumcenter, incenter, and orthocenter. Today, mathematicians have discovered over 40,000 triangle centers. They are listed in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, which is run by Clark Kimberling at the University of Evansville. \nProperties of a center.\nA triangle center is a function of the three vertices (corners) of the triangle. Each triangle center has two properties in common.\n1) Homogeneity: If the triangle is transformed while keeping similarity, (such as by translation, reflection, rotation, or dilation) the center will move in the same way as the triangle moves.\n2) Bisymmetry: It must not be important to the function which vertex (corner) comes first, second, or third. For example, a center of points A, B, and C must be the same as that center of points A, C, and B.\nSome triangle centers.\nIf a triangle is not equilateral, then the centroid, orthocenter, circumcenter, and nine-point center form a line called the Euler line, named after Leonhard Euler."}

It was first shown on the Fox network on December 17, 2000. The episode is about Springfield Elementary School being stuck in a snowstorm.\nThe episode's story came from an event in the episode writer's life. The episode takes place in winter. This made it harder for animators to make the animation of the episode. The episode makes references to \"Smilla's Sense of Snow\", \"The Deer Hunter\", and Kristi Yamaguchi.\nStory.\nThe Simpson family go to a circus show called Cirque de Pur\u00e9e (a parody of Cirque du Soleil). However, a blizzard makes the circus have to stop. All of the schools (except the one Bart and Lisa go to) close because of the blizzard. Only some of the students go to the school during the blizzard. Seymour Skinner and Groundskeeper Willie are the only people in the school's faculty that came. Skinner puts a DVD in a movie projector. When the DVD gets set on fire, the school day ends. However, the blizzard causes snow to pile in front of the doors. Nobody in the school is able to leave now.\nSkinner gives the students apples and relish to make sure they are not hungry. Nelson tries to get out of the school but Skinner will not let him. Skinner tries to get respect from the students in a way that is similar to the U.S. Army. Bart tries to make a tunnel in the snow so he can leave the school. Skinner breaks the tunnel but gets stuck inside of the snow. The students put Skinner in a big bag and take control of the school. \nHomer and Ned get in a car to drive to the school. Homer hits a fire hydrant with the car. The water from the fire hydrant freezes and makes them stuck inside. They start to get carbon monoxide poisoning from the large levels of carbon monoxide in the car. Skinner uses a hamster to get everyone out of the school. The hamster goes to Homer and Ned and breaks the car window. The car hits a salt silo that falls next to the school. The salt melts the snow, which makes the students now able to leave the school. Superintendent Chalmers finds the school in a bad condition and is angry at Skinner until Bart tells him about the blizzard. Homer starts to hallucinate from the carbon dioxide and sees Lisa as a camel.\nProduction.\n\"Skinner's Sense of Snow\" was written by Tim Long. Lance Kramer is the director of the episode. The episode's story came from Long. One time while he was a child, a blizzard hit Exeter, Ontario. He was sad when he learned that every school was closed except for the one he went to. Long was also stuck in the school with his teachers because of snow. He said that \"It was hellish, but then became a sweet thing\". He also said that many dads used snowmobiles to give them food while inside the school. Matt Selman, a writer for the show, got the idea for the Simpson family to go to Cirque du Pur\u00e9e. This idea became the beginning of the episode's story.\nThe episode's director, Lance Kramer, wanted the animators of the episode to watch a Cieque du Soleil show. The animators did not watch one. Mike Scully thought that the animators did a great job on animating the circus show. The episode is set in the winter. This made it harder for animators to animate than it is for other episodes. Kramer said that \"It just adds another element\". He shows this by talking about episodes that are set in winter:\nThe particles on the film were put in by a post-production team. Scully said that the post-production team \"never gets enough credit\". When Homer and Ned drive to the school, the song \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" by Bad Company plays. The song \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" by Kiss was going to play but the show's staff did not get the permission to play it.\nReception.\nMac McEntire from DVD Verdict thought that the episode was \"outrageous\" and a \"standout\" (better than others). He said that the comedy about the \"cool kids versus dorky adults\" is the best part of the episode. Matt Haigh of Den of Geek said that the episode is \"gold\" (good in quality). Elizabeth Skipper from DVD Verdict says that episodes with Principal Skinner are a \"sure thing\" and that this episode was \"no exception\". Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode \"mediocre\". He thought that the episode's story was not as good as it could have been."}

{"id": "809070", "revid": "145452", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=809070", "title": "Xiaomi", "text": "Xiaomi Corporation (; ) is a Chinese multinational electronics company founded in April 2010 and headquartered in Beijing. Xiaomi makes and invests in smartphones, mobile apps, laptops, home appliances, bags, shoes, consumer electronics, and many other products. Xiaomi is also the fourth company in the world after Apple, Samsung and Huawei to have self-developed mobile phone chip capabilities.\nXiaomi released its first smartphone in August 2011 and rapidly gained market share in China to become the country's largest smartphone company in 2014. At the start of second quarter of 2018, Xiaomi was the world's fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer, leading in both the largest market, China, and the second-largest market, India. Xiaomi later developed a wider range of consumer electronics, including a smart home (IoT) product ecosystem, which has connected more than 100 million smart devices and appliances. Monthly active users (MAUs) of MIUI increased to 291.6 million in September 2019.\nXiaomi has 16,700 employees worldwide. It has expanded to other markets including Greater China, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Russia, South Africa and most countries and regions in Southeast Asia and Europe. According to \"Forbes\", Lei Jun, the founder and CEO, has an estimated net worth of US$12.5 billion. Xiaomi is the world's 4th most valuable technology start-up after receiving US$1.1 billion funding from investors, making Xiaomi's valuation more than US$46 billion. Ranked 468th, Xiaomi is the youngest company on Fortune Global 500 list for 2019. In 2019, Xiaomi's mobile phone shipments reached 125 million units, ranking fourth globally since 2018. The company has been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2018.\nEtymology.\n\"Xiaomi\" () is the Chinese word for \"millet\". In 2011 its CEO Lei Jun suggested there are more meanings than just the \"millet and rice. He linked the \"Xiao\" () part to the Buddhist concept that \"a single grain of rice of a Buddhist is as great as a mountain,\" suggesting Xiaomi wants to work from the little things, instead of starting by striving for perfection, while \"mi\" () is an acronym for Mobile Internet and also Mission Impossible, referring to the obstacles encountered in starting the company. He also stated that he thinks the name is cute. In 2012 Lei Jun said that the name is about revolution and being able to bring innovation into a new area. Xiaomi's new 'Rifle' processor has given weight to several sources linking the latter meaning to the Communist Party of China's \"millet and rifle\" (\u5c0f\u7c73\u52a0\u6b65\u67aa) revolutionary idiom during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nBusiness model.\nLei Jun, Xiaomi's CEO, said that the company prices the phone almost at bill-of-material prices, without compromising the component quality and performance compared to other premium smartphones. It also profits by selling phone-related peripheral devices, smart home products, apps, online videos and themes. According to Xiaomi's Hugo Barra in 2014, the company sees hardware sales as a means of delivering software and services in the long term, \"We are an Internet and a software company much more than a hardware company.\" However, financial data available at the time indicated that this is either wishful thinking or plans for the far future: 94% of the company's revenue came from mobile phone sales, an even higher proportion than Apple.\nAt first, to reduce overhead costs, Xiaomi did not own any physical stores, selling exclusively from its online store. In recent years, they have opened 54 brick and mortar stores to combat the strategies of other low-cost competitors in Chinese markets. It also did away with traditional advertising and relies on social networking services and word-of-mouth to publicize its products.\nBy keeping a tight control over its stock, Xiaomi is able to place cheaper batch orders as demand dictates. Limited availability flash sales ensure that supply never outstrips demand and helps promote its products. In contrast, traditional OEMs incur large upfront productions costs, which must be recouped by selling prices, in order to ship phones, some of which may not sell, out to retailers all around the world.\nXiaomi say that they listen closely to customer feedback, having them test out upcoming features themselves, and building an extensive online community. Lei Jun described it this way, \"When I was with Kingsoft, I had the opportunity to work with Nokia and Motorola, two mobile phone giants of their time. One day, I pointed out to their R&amp;D boss, some inadequacies. After that, they merely acknowledged my input but never acted upon what I had said. So I thought to myself, if I make a phone, you can tell me anything you wish for it or what's wrong. If it is justifiable, we will work on it immediately. I'll give you an update every week and you may even see your wishes come true within a week. In practice, Xiaomi's product managers spend a lot of time browsing through the company's user forums. Once a suggestion is picked up, it is quickly transferred to the engineers. Therefore, features can turn from a mere concept to shipping products within a week. The company then ships a new batch of phones out every week on Tuesday at noon Beijing time, containing the new software builds and possible minor hardware tweaks. Xiaomi calls this process \"design as you build.\"\nXiaomi's mascot, Mitu, is a white rabbit wearing an Ushanka (known locally as a \"Lei Feng hat\" in China) with a red star and a red scarf around its neck.\nBrands.\nPOCO is a sub-brand owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi Corporation. It was first announced in August 2018 as a mid-range smartphone line, and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 17 January 2020 with entry-level and mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Mi phones. POCO phones use the Xiaomi MIUI user interface on top of Android.\nIn Q4 of 2018, the POCO F1 reportedly become the best selling smartphone sold online in India, beating competition such as the OnePlus 6. The Pocophone was sometimes referred to as the \"flagship killer killer\" for offering high-end specifications at an affordable price. The first POCO phone was released in 2018 in India on Xiaomi's website. It instantly became a bestseller with 700,000 units sold until 6 December 2018, becoming the best selling smartphone sold online in India.\nProducts.\nXiaomi produces many products. Observers suggest that part of Xiaomi's rapid success rests on its ability to differentiate itself within the Android universe. The company has increased its range of products; its smartphones include: Mi Series, Mi Note Series (got a new update after 3 years, with the Mi Note 10 Pro), Mi Max Series, Mi Mix Series, Redmi and POCO Series. As well as mobile phones, Xiaomi has started selling wearables, mobile accessories, and appliances such as television and speakers. In 2018 it was selling tablets, laptops, and smart-home devices.\nXiaomi operates on a vertically-integrated model that enables the company to sell hardware at cost or below in order to attract users and earn money by selling content. Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who served Xiaomi's vice president from 2014 to 2017, characterized the organization as \"an Internet and a software company much more than a hardware company\".\nXiaomi also keeps its prices low or close to its manufacturing costs by keeping most of its products in the market longer, eighteen months rather than the six-month norm followed by many smartphone companies. Xiaomi said they sell their phones close to cost and intends to make profit on services.\nThe company's version of the Android operating system and MIUI skin, with its design, app marketplace, and functionalities, has established a community of users who form a crucial part of Xiaomi's customer base and contribute to the company's drive for market awareness. This ecosystem is a massive source of revenue as indicated in 2015, when sales from the platform reached $750 million.\nThe company focuses on India, the world's second-largest smartphone market. Xiaomi announced on 2 May 2018, the launch of Mi Music and Mi Video to offer \"value-added internet services\" in India. On 22 March 2017, Xiaomi announced that it planned to set up a second manufacturing unit in India in partnership with contract manufacturer Foxconn. On 7 August 2018, Xiaomi announced on its blog that Holitech Technology Co. Ltd., Xiaomi's top supplier, would invest up to $200 million over the next three years to set up a major new plant in India.\nIn 2019 Xiaomi started to sell simple goods such as sunglasses, caps, pillows, glass lunchboxes, cups, filters, bags, backpacks, luggage, screwdrivers, and umbrellas.\nIn April 2019, researchers at Check Point found a security breach in Xiaomi phone apps. The security flaw was reported to be preinstalled.\nIn 2019, the company announced that it would launch more than 10 5G phones in 2020, some of them being: Mi 10/10 Pro with 5G functionality included.\nIn March 2020, Xiaomi showcased its new 40W wireless charging solution, which was able to fully charge a smartphone with a 4,000mAh battery from flat in 40 minutes.\nIn December 2020, Xiaomi collaborates with award-winning photographer Steve McCurry, to promote the photographic capabilities of the Mi 10T Pro handset. The brand\u2019s \u2018My Unsung Hero\u2019 campaign features images captured on the Mi 10T Pro. \nControversies.\nGPL violation.\nXiaomi was unfavorably covered for its non-compliance with the terms of the GNU GPL. The Android project's Linux kernel is licensed under the copyleft terms of the GPL, which requires Xiaomi to distribute the complete source code of the Android kernel and device trees for every Android device it distributes. By refusing to do so, or by unreasonably delaying these releases, Xiaomi is operating in violation of intellectual property law in China, as a WIPO state. Prominent Android developer Francisco Franco publicly criticized Xiaomi's behaviour after repeated delays in the release of kernel source code. Xiaomi in 2013 said that it would release the kernel code. The kernel source code is available on the GitHub website.\nComparisons with Apple Inc..\nXiaomi has been compared to the American corporation Apple Inc., as reviewers found some of Xiaomi's phones and tablets similar in appearance to Apple's. In addition, the marketing strategy of Xiaomi is at times described as riding on the back of the \"cult of Apple\". It is reported that, after reading a book about Steve Jobs in college, Xiaomi's chairman and CEO, Lei Jun, carefully cultivated a Steve Jobs image, including jeans, dark shirts, and Jobs's announcement style at Xiaomi's earlier product announcements. Given the above, he was categorized as a \"counterfeit Jobs.\"\nIn 2012, the company was said to be counterfeiting Apple's philosophy and mindset. In 2013, critics debated how much of Xiaomi's products were innovative, and how much of their innovation was just really good public relations. Others point out that while there are similarities to Apple, the ability to customize the software based upon user preferences through the use of Google's Android operating system sets Xiaomi apart.\nState administration of radio, film, and television issue.\nIn November 2012, Xiaomi's smart set-top box stopped working one week after the launch due to the company having run afoul of China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. The regulatory issues were overcome in January 2013.\nHugo Barra.\nIn August 2013, the company announced that it was hiring Hugo Barra from Google, where he served as vice president of product management for the Android platform. Barra has declined to comment on the timing of the Google relationships, and stated that he had been in talks with Xiaomi for over a year prior to announcing the move. He was employed as vice president of Xiaomi to expand the company outside of mainland China, making Xiaomi the first company selling smartphones to poach a senior staffer from Google's Android team. Barra's focus was to help Xiaomi grow internationally.\nBarra quit his position in January 2017 to join Facebook as VP of virtual reality.\nPrivacy concerns and alleged data theft.\nXiaomi's cloud storage service Mi Cloud stores all user data in its servers in China. As a company based in China, it is must share data with the Chinese government under the China Internet Security Law and National Intelligence Law. Xiaomi's Cloud messaging service sent some private data, including call logs and contact information, to Xiaomi servers. Xiaomi later released an MIUI update that made cloud messaging optional and that no private data was sent to Xiaomi servers if the cloud messaging service was turned off.\nIn October 2014, Xiaomi announced that they were setting up servers outside of China for international users, citing improved services and compliance to regulations in several nations. Around the same time, the Indian Air Force warned against Xiaomi phones, stating that they were a national threat as they sent user data to an agency of the Chinese government.\nOn 30 April 2020, Forbes reported that Xiaomi extensively tracks use of its browsers, including private browser activity, phone metadata, and device navigation, and more alarmingly, without secure encryption or anonymization, more invasively and to a greater extent than mainstream browsers. Xiaomi disputed the claims, while affirming that it did extensively collect browsing data, and claiming that the data was not linked to any individuals and that consumers had consented to being tracked. Xiaomi later posted a response stating that the collection of aggregated usage statistics data is used for internal analysis, and would not link any personally identifiable information to any of this data. However after a followup by the report's originator, Gabriel Cirlig, Xiaomi backed down and added an option to completely stop the information leak when using their browser in incognito mode.\nSales numbers.\nThe Taiwanese Fair Trade Commission had investigated the flash sales and found that Xiaomi had sold fewer smartphones than advertised. In December 2014, three flash sales were investigated. In those flash sales Xiaomi claimed that the number of smartphones sold was 10,000 units each for the first two sales, and 8,000 units for the third one. However, FTC investigated the claims and found that Xiaomi sold 9,339 devices in the first flash sale, 9,492 units in the second one, and 7,389 for the third. It was found that during the first flash sale, Xiaomi had given 1,750 priority \u2018F-codes\u2019 to people who could place their orders without having to go through the flash sale, thus diminishing the stock that was publicly available. The FTC fined Xiaomi .\nTemporary ban and criticism in India.\nOn 9 December 2014, the High Court of Delhi granted an ex parte injunction that banned the import and sale of Xiaomi products in India. The injunction was issued in response to a complaint filed by Ericsson in connection with the infringement of its patent licensed under FRAND (Fair, Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing). The injunction was applicable until 5 February 2015, the date on which the High Court was scheduled to summon both parties for a formal hearing of the case. On 16 December, the High Court granted permission to Xiaomi to sell its devices running on a Qualcomm-based processor until 8 January 2015. Following that, Xiaomi held various sales on Flipkart, including one on 30 December 2014. Following that sale, the company received press coverage after its flagship Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G phone sold out in six seconds. A judge extended the division bench's interim order, allowing Xiaomi to continue the sale of Qualcomm chipset-based handsets until March 2018.\nOn 27 June 2020, CAIT - the Confederation of All India Traders - criticized Manu Kumar Jain, Xiaomi global vice president and managing director of Xiaomi India, for disrespecting the sentiments of Indian citizens, after he claimed a \"Boycott Chinese Products\" campaign was the result of mob mentality.\nSecurity and Privacy Concerns.\nSecurity Issues in Indian and certain overseas versions of MIUI.\nIn April 2019, Indian security researcher Arif Khan discovered a security vulnerability affecting the Indian and certain global versions of MIUI's native browser application - Mi Browser and Mint Browser, which is also developed by Xiaomi, both of which were based on the same browser engine, which was bypassed more than 2 times subsequently after Xiaomi fixed it. Khan also found a URL Address Bar Spoofing vulnerability affecting only the Indian and certain overseas versions but not the Chinese version. Again in the same month, Khan reportedly found another major lock screen bypass vulnerability affecting only the Indian version of MIUI which was using Glance, which allowed exfiltration of sensitive user data despite MIUI's lock screen protection, which was eventually fixed by Xiaomi after several media reports.

{"id": "809084", "revid": "1150555", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=809084", "title": "Marcel Mauss", "text": "Marcel Mauss (May 10, 1872 - February 10, 1950) was a French anthropologist and sociologist. With a strong background in sociology, he began using ethnography to look at how different cultures build relationships. He was also influenced by his nephew, another famous anthropologist, \u00c9mile Durkheim. Mauss is known for his work on gifts and exchange, magic, sacrifice, the body, and comparing cultures. Mauss\u2019s most famous work is \"The Gift\". \"The Gift\" is about the ways gifts and exchanges build relationships. Mauss is also known for influencing structural anthropologists such as Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss.\nBackground and Education.\nMarcel Mauss was born in \u00c9pinal, France in 1872. His parents were Gerson Mauss and Rosine (Durkheim) Mauss. He was raised in a non-observant Jewish family.\nIn the early 1890s, Mauss went to the University of Bordeaux where he studied many subjects including religion and philosophy. Later he moved to Paris, France where he studied at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes (an important French research school). In Paris, Mauss studied Sanskrit, Hebrew, history of religion, and other topics. Mauss eventually became a professor at \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes. He taught about many different religions.\nDuring World War I, Mauss served in the French army as an interpreter.\nMauss helped form the Institut d'ethnologie (Ethnology Institute) at the University of Paris in 1925 with Paul Rivet and Lucien L\u00e9vy-Bruhl. He also was the chair of the sociology department at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris from 1931-1939.\nInfluences.\nTamati Ranapiri.\nMauss\u2019s theories about the role of gifts in M\u0101ori culture relied heavily on the information provided by Tamati Ranapiri. Ranapiri was a M\u0101ori scholar who exchanged letters with ethnographer Elsdon Best. Through these letters, Ranapiri explained how gifts were used to connect people in M\u0101ori society. According to Ranapiri, gifts created commitment without force. These commitments created by gifts made social relationships and bonds stronger.\nElsdon Best.\nElsdon Best was an enthographer who studied the M\u0101ori people of New Zealand. Mauss used Best\u2019s letters and primary data to write his work about M\u0101ori gift giving.\n\u00c9mile Durkheim.\n\u00c9mile Durkheim was Marcel Mauss\u2019s uncle as well as a professional influence. The two worked together on many projects. Durkheim and Mauss worked together to publish the book \"Primitive Classifications.\" This book was a response to Immanuel Kant\u2019s categories of understanding. Durkheim and Mauss also worked together to publish articles in \"L\u2019Ann\u00e9e Sociologique\". \"L\u2019Ann\u00e9e Sociologique\" was a sociology journal created by Durkheim.\nHenri Hubert.\nMauss referred to Hubert as his \"Siamese twin\" and is also a co-author of many of Marcel's works. In works that they are not co-authored, they cite each other. As Mauss said \"[e]verything I don't know, Mauss knows, and everything Mauss doesn't know, I know.\" Their major works and theories were products of their teamwork, and therefore both greatly influenced each other. \nMajor Works and Theories.\n\"The Gift\".\n\"The Gift\" was published in 1925. It was written partially in response to the Bolshevik Revolution. In this book, Mauss argued that every society has both markets and money of some kind as well as altruism. Mauss claims that gifts are a \u201ctotal social fact\u201d which have spiritual parts to them. \"The Gift\" also examines gift giving traditions of some indigenous peoples. Mauss writes about the M\u0101ori idea of \u201cHau.\" He also talks about Potlatch, which was first practiced by indigenous groups in North America. Mauss believed that gift giving can tell us a lot about social relationships. He also believed that gift giving was connected to power. Mauss claimed that there is no such thing as a free gift. He thought every gift was part of an ongoing system of giving and receiving.\nSacrifice and The Body.\nMauss saw sacrifice as a system of exchange as well. In 1899, Mauss published \"Sacrifice: Its Nature and Functions\" with Henri Hubert. This book compares many religious practices with a focus on sacrifice and the body. Mauss and Hubert compared religions from many places and time periods. They describe sacrifice as a system which involves both actions that are aimed towards a holy person or object and actions that are aimed away from a holy person or object. Mauss and Hubert claimed that the body is the result of many different habits and qualities. They claimed that a person is made up of certain actions that are performed through specific behaviors. \nMagic.\nMauss teamed up with Hubert again in 1902 to publish \"A General Theory of Magic\". In this book, Mauss and Hubert claimed that social events, rather than individual people, were magic. This is another cross-cultural comparison, like Mauss and Hubert's work on sacrifice. They claim that magic is a social experience. The book examines the relationships between magic and religion, science, and technology. Mauss and Hubert also trace the long-lasting impact of magic on our modern ideas, such as the idea of good and bad luck.\nManual of Ethnography.\n\"Manual of Ethnography\" is a collection of Mauss's lectures on how to successfully do ethnography. Ethnography is when sociologists and anthropologists try to understand a culture through observing and sometimes participating in that group. In his lectures, he shows that observers should not assume that a culture will have the same opinions and ways of doing things as their own culture. He also describes how ethnographers should observe, collect data, and how to understand the different social structures that make up a group.\nReligion and Society.\n\"Saints, Heroes, Myths, and Rites\" is a collection of essays written by Mauss, Hubert and Hertz. Like Durkheim, they believed that as people started practicing their own religions, people would find new ways to maintain a sense of community based on their shared morals. Myths are also part of religion. They are a result of any human society. Because they are found in every society, they are not imaginary. Myths are subconscious symbols that the individual uses to understand their experiences. The subconscious is also called the unconscious. It is the part of a person's mind that thinks and remembers things without the person knowing it. \nCritiques.\nIn 2017, Georgina Stewart published a criticism \"The Gift\", specifically on Mauss' understanding of Hau. Stewart claims that a misunderstanding of M\u0101ori beliefs about the cosmos and language differences caused Mauss to misunderstand the M\u0101ori concept of Hau. Alain Testart (1998) claimed that Mauss exaggerated the idea that all gifts need to be repaid. Testart said that there were some truly free gifts, such as giving money to a homeless person as you walk by them. James Laidlaw also points out an example of free gifts within Jainism, a religion where followers believe that they cause a war between microorganisms if they prepare their own food, so they rely on outside food donations. \nImpacts.\nMauss is credited for being a major inspiration for Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss. Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss went on to develop the structuralist view of cultural anthropology. Mauss also inspired other structuralists such as Pierre Bourdieu. Mauss is also known for inspiring future work on topics such as exchange theory and economic anthropology. Mauss' cross-cultural comparisons were radical for his time, and he set the stage for the next generation of cultural anthropologists to use a similar comparative approach.\nMauss' \"The Gift\" inspired French philosopher Georges Bataille to understand how money is increasingly being wasted in society. His influence has also appeared in French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu's works. In them, he highlight's Mauss's idea of habitus. Habitus describes habits and skills that we learn while being within our society. These are ingrained in us and influence the way we perceive and react to the world around us. Someone with a similar upbringing might have similar habitus. "}

The service collects many data points, including the serial number of the device, the phone number, IMEI, network connections and time records of user activity in each application. Users can delete the system service through ADB.

It also has a pixel density of 401ppi, and features smaller bezels than found in previous OnePlus smartphones such as the OnePlus 5 and 3T. The 5T's body is made entirely from anodized aluminum, uses 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 as protection for the display, and uses a ceramic coating for the fingerprint sensor which was moved to the rear of the phone. It also features an \"Alert Slider\" located on the left side of the device, a feature that is also available on its predecessors, the 5, the 3T, and the 3, which allows users to set their notifications to silent. The 5T is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and comes with the choice of either 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, depending on the storage configuration. Similar to its predecessor, the phone is available in either a 64GB or 128GB configuration.\nUnlike OnePlus devices released in the past, the phone does not feature any physical hardware buttons on the front of the device, electing to use virtual navigation keys instead. It features a non-removable 3,300 mAh battery, capable of fast charging by OnePlus' proprietary Dash Charge through its USB-C port. The phone retains the 3.5mm headphone jack, but lacks stereo speakers, instead opting for a mono speaker located on the bottom of the device. The device features a combination of a 16\u00a0MP main lens (Sony Exmor IMX398) and a 20\u00a0MP secondary lens (Sony Exmor IMX376K) located on the device's rear, both of which have an aperture of f/1.7. They are capable of shooting 4K video and \"Portrait mode\" shots, like many other flagship devices. The front (selfie) camera is also a 16\u00a0MP sensor, with an aperture of f/2.0. The 5T features a \"Face Unlock\" facial recognition feature that can be used to unlock the device, however it lacks the ability to authenticate purchases. Since it uses 2D scanning, it is relatively faster than some other competitors, but doesn't work in particular lighting conditions and is not as secure.\nThe OnePlus 5T has become available in multiple limited edition variants over time, such as a Star Wars edition promoting , which came with a special case and a new color scheme; a \"Sandstone White\" variant which was released on 5 January 2018 and featured a white color scheme and a red \"Alert Slider\", which sold out in under 2 hours; and a \"Lava Red\" variant which was released on 11 January 2018 initially in India, and became available in Europe and North America on 6 February.\nSoftware.\nThe OnePlus 5T ships with Android 7.1.1 \"Nougat\" and uses the OxygenOS user interface, OnePlus' proprietary custom skin built on top of Android, adding various features not found in the stock Android operating system, such as night mode and reading mode, which both change the color temperature of the device's screen, and the ability to change the Bluetooth audio codec. The night mode reduces the screen's color temperature to reduce blue light levels, while the reading mode applies a monochrome-like effect to the screen. Unlike the OnePlus 5, the 5T no longer overrides the performance scaling in benchmarks to max out CPU and GPU clocks in specific applications, this makes benchmarks being run on the 5T more accurate.\nOnePlus promised an update to Android 8 \"Oreo\" (OxygenOS 5.0) in early 2018. The first beta for this version was released on 29 December 2017, but was pulled a couple days later due to issues with regards to instability that were present. OnePlus fixed the issues and reuploaded the beta version on 3 January 2018.\nThe first stable Android Oreo-based version of OxygenOS (OxygenOS 5.0.2) for the OnePlus 5T was released on 31 January 2018, introducing features such as Picture-in-Picture, Autofill, and Notification Dots, as well as a faster boot time. The update also introduced a redesigned Quick Settings menu, introduces a security patch for CVE-2017-13218, and updates a few system applications. The update does not contain the Treble feature for device independent system updates. On 11 March 2018, OnePlus released the Android 8.1 \"Oreo\" update in beta for the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T, bringing the changes made to Android 8.1 such as the Neural Networks and Shared memory APIs, the dimming of the navigation bar when it is not being used to the devices, and other improvements, such as improvements to the Autofill framework. The update also updated the security patch level to 1 February 2018. In Q2 2020 The OnePlus 5 and 5T got their stable Android 10 updates with OxygenOS \nNetwork compatibility.\nThe OnePlus 5T includes only a single variant for cellular networks worldwide.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nOnePlus 5T received generally positive reviews. \"The Verge\" was full praise for the phone's elegant design and optimized software but noted that the camera was still mediocre. Engadget heaped praise on the phone for its excellent performance despite its price bracket. "}

{"id": "809163", "revid": "1035902", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=809163", "title": "Big Rip", "text": "In physical cosmology, the Big Rip is a theory which describes the ultimate fate of the universe. According to this theory, everything in the universe, even spacetime itself will be torn apart by the expansion of the universe until distances between particles will become infinite. According to the standard model of cosmology the scale factor of the universe is known to be accelerating and, in the future era it will increase more rapidly. However, this expansion is similar for every moment of time (hence the exponential law \u2013 the expansion of a local volume is the same number of times over the same time interval), and is identified by an unchanging, small Hubble constant which is ignored by any bound material structures. Similarly in the Big Rip scenario the Hubble constant increases to infinity in a finite time.\nThe possibility of sudden rip singularity occurs only for hypothetical matter (phantom energy) but it is unlikely to occur in physical properties.\nOverview.\nThe truth of the hypothesis relies on the type of dark energy present in our universe. The type that could prove this hypothesis is a constantly increasing form of dark energy, known as phantom energy. If the dark energy in the universe increases without limit, it could destroy all forces that hold the universe together. The key value is the equation of state parameter \"w\", the ratio between the dark energy pressure and its energy density. If -1\u00a0&lt;\u00a0\"w\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a00, the expansion of the universe continues to increase, but the dark energy tends to stop over time. So the Big Rip does not happen. Phantom energy has \"w\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a0\u22121, which means that its density increases as the universe expands.\nA universe with more phantom energy is an accelerating universe, expanding at an ever-increasing rate. However, this implies that the size of the observable universe and the particle horizon is continually getting smaller \u2014 the distance at which objects are moving away at the speed of light from an observer becomes ever closer, and the distance over which interactions can propagate becomes ever shorter. When the size of the particle horizon becomes smaller than any particular structure, no interaction by any of the fundamental forces can occur between the farthest parts of the structure, and the structure is \"ripped apart\". The progression of time itself will stop. The model says that after a finite time there will be a final singularity, called the \"Big Rip\", in which the observable universe will reach zero size and all distances will reach into infinite value.\nThe authors of this hypothesis, led by Robert R. Caldwell of Dartmouth College, calculate the time from the present to the Big Rip to be\nwhere \"w\" is defined above, \"H\"0 is Hubble's constant and \"\u03a9\"m is the present value of the density of all the matter in the universe.\nHowever, observations of the galaxy cluster speeds by the Chandra X-ray Observatory seem to tell that the value of \"w\" is approximately \u22120.991, meaning the Big Rip will not happen \nAuthor's example.\nIn their paper, the authors consider a hypothetical example with \"w\"\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.5, \"H\"0\u00a0=\u00a070\u00a0km/s/Mpc, and \"\u03a9\"m\u00a0=\u00a00.3, in which case the Big Rip would happen approximately 22 billion years from the present. In this scenario, galaxies would first be separated from each other about 200 million years before the Big Rip. About 60 million years before the Big Rip, galaxies would begin to break up as small parts as gravity becomes too weak to hold them together. Planetary systems like the Solar System would become gravitationally unbound and all planets will be separated from their orbit in about three months before the Big Rip. Planets would fly off into the rapidly expanding universe. In the last minutes, stars and planets would be torn apart, and the now dispersed atoms would be destroyed about 10\u221219 seconds before the end. At the time the Big Rip occurs, even spacetime itself would be ripped apart and the scale factor would be infinity.\nObserved universe.\nEvidence indicates \"w\" to be very close to \u22121 in our universe, which makes \"w\" the dominating term in the equation. The closer that \"w\" is to \u22121, the closer the denominator is to zero and the further the Big Rip is in the future. If \"w\" were exactly equal to \u22121, the Big Rip could not happen, regardless of the values of \"H\"0 or \"\u03a9\"m.\nAccording to the latest cosmological data available, it is still unsure which one is correct, \"w\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a0\u22121, \"w\"\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121, and \"w\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\u22121."}

Komala has been seeking a nonreligious democratic federal ruling system to replace the current government, which is run by religious people. This party is currently exiled in northern Iraq, where its leaders work from. Komala is a member of the International Socialist and Progressive Alliance. This is an organization that has many different social democrats, socialist, and progressive groups. Komala wants to make laws against sexual violence and to protect children during armed conflicts. Komala also wants to make laws against anti-personnel land mines.\nHistory.\nThe Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan started in 1969, among Kurdish leftist students and intellectuals in Tehran and some Kurdish towns. Since there was no political freedom in Iran, every political organization and even small student circles had to go into hiding and organize underground. Komala was no exception. Like all other opposition organizations of that time, especially the leftist groups of the sixties and seventies, Komala faced severe repression.\nDuring those years many of Komala's members and its leadership experienced persecution, torture and imprisonment in the hands of , Shah\u2019s notorious secret police, but Komala managed to survive and protect the main body of its organization and its growing network of activists. More than 9 years of hard and disciplined work prior to the outbreak of Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, bore its fruit and helped Komala build a strong and cohesive body of cadres among sections of Kurdish society. Komala managed to win over considerable amounts of Kurdish students, teachers, intellectuals and young people and to develop a significant influence and social base among workers and peasants throughout Kurdistan.\nKomala actively participated in the Iranian Revolution and in fact was behind almost every demonstration and popular movement of that period. On March 16, 1979, a few days after the victory of the Revolution, Komala launched an open political party. By this time Komala had already become a major political force in Iranian Kurdistan. The birth of Komala and its rapid growth among large sections of Kurdish society in Iran, apart from its own hard work, discipline and dedication, can be attributed to a combination of social factors during a period of Iran\u2019s transition from a traditional and patriarchal society to a so-called pseudo-modern one.\nIdeology.\nAfter a long and heated debate among its ranks and in public during the 1990s, finally the majority of the Komala Party\u2019s cadres and members decided on a renewal programme to adapt to new domestic and global developments. Since year 2000, Komala Party has undergone a major overhaul. This move was welcomed by the great majority of people, intellectuals, students, women, civil activists, Komala veteran activists and others.\nWhile preserving its socialist values, Komala fights for Kurdish rights, a democratic secular pluralist federal Iran, social justice, democratic labour laws, the freedom of assembly and organization, political freedoms, democracy, human rights, women\u2019s rights and cultural and religious tolerance.\nInternational Affiliation.\nKomala Party of Iranian Kurdistan is currently a consultative member of the International Socialist, a worldwide organization for progressive forces including social democrats, socialists and labor parties to gather under. \nKomala Party of Iranian Kurdistan is also a member of the German-based Progressive Alliance, an organization with member organizations from social democrats and progressive organizations that believe in both social democracy and social progress.\nKomala Party of Iranian Kurdistan is a member of Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, UNPO, an international organization aimed at promoting neglected and marginalized nations. Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan joined UNPO in 2007.\nNational Affiliation.\nKomala Party of Iranian Kurdistan is a member of Iran Transition Council, Congress of Nationalities for a Federal Iran, Solidarity for Freedom and Equality in Iran, the Council of Iranian Democrats. and Cooperation Center for Iranian Kurdistan Political Parties. The Secretary General of Komala, Abdulla Mohtadi, is the Secretariat for Special affairs of ITC and Nahid Bahmani, a leadership member of Komala, is the Secretariat of Ethnic Affairs of ITC.\nOrganizational Structure.\n\"Komala has a collective and democratic decision-making system.

This practice is called survival sex. The term is used by sex trade, poverty researchers, and aid workers. Very often, people who engage in survival sex are homeless. Sometimes, survival sex is used to get illegal drugs. \nSurvival sex is common throughout the world. It has been studied in many countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, Colombia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.\nResearchers estimate that of homeless youth in North America, one in three has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in Los Angeles, about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex. People who have been homeless for a longer time, who have become victims, or who have become criminals are more likely to engage in survival sex. This is also true for people who have attempted suicide, who are pregnant, or those who have a STI.\nSurvival sex is common in refugee camps. In Uganda, 1.4 million civilians have been displaced by conflicts between Ugandan government forces and the militant Lord's Resistance Army. Many of them live in refugee camps in northern Uganda. Human Rights Watch reported in 2005 that displaced women and girls in these camps were engaging in survival sex with other camp residents, local defense personnel, and Ugandan government soldiers."}

The end of the last ice age saw sea levels rise, and the old connections were broken.\nBlocks.\nThe main continental blocks of the Australian continent are;\nAround them are several Proterozoic volcanic belts and sedimentary basins. The cratons formed the greater Australian landmass in the late Archaean to mesoProterozoic, (~2400 mya to 1,600 mya).\nThe older, western, two-thirds of the continent is much thicker (over 200 km thick) than the eastern third (about 38 to 59 km thick). The continental crust is mainly made of Archaean, Proterozoic and some Palaeozoic granites and gneisses. A thin veneer of mainly Phanerozoic sedimentary basins cover much of the Australian landmass (these are up to 7\u00a0km thick).\nMeteorite craters.\nMany meteorite craters have been found in Australia, but few have yet been confirmed.\nThe Earth Impact Database lists 190 confirmed craters, of which Australia has 27. The largest is the Yarrabubba crater in mid Western Australia. Its estimated age is 2.229 billion years ago. It is one of the oldest known impact structures on Earth."}

On October 28, 1962, the newly formed SD Compostela merged with the Club Arenal. The decade of the 1970s was irregular. The team played in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n, in the Regional category and in the new Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. Its first promotion to a semi-national stage occurred in 1977, with a promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B (Group 1), which lasted just one season; \"Compos\" promoted again in 1980, this time lasting six years.\nRelegation in 1986 was compounded by off-field controversy surrounding the actions of then president Francisco Steppe. He resigned amid allegations of receipt of payments to throw a game against Pontevedra CF, which would assure the opposition's maintenance in the category. The late 1980s saw a significant restructuring of the club both at board and management levels and, in 1990, Compostela regained third-level status.\nThe following campaign was to prove the club's most successful to date. On 23 June 1991, a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the \"Estadio Municipal Santa Isabel\", saw goals from Juanito and Ochoa (two) clinch a 3\u20131 victory in the final play-off match against CD Badajoz, for a first-ever Segunda Divisi\u00f3n visit.\nThe move to \"Estadio Multiusos de San L\u00e1zaro\" coincided with the continuing rise in the team's fortunes and, at the end of 1993\u201394, following a 3\u20131 play-off victory against Rayo Vallecano, Compostela reached La Liga. Compostela did remarkably well, and reached a best finish of 10th in 1995\u201396, mainly courtesy of strikers Christopher Ohen and Bent Christensen, whom totalled 23 league goals.\nAfter four seasons at the top, Compostela was relegated after losing a relegation play-off match to Villarreal CF on the away goals rule, despite playing overall attractive football. The club was also about to start a downward spiral; after a relegation to the third level in 2001 the team returned the following year but, in the following campaign, played to a backdrop of off-field distractions, with the players and staff going unpaid for months \u2013 a final ninth place was not enough to prevent another relegation, as the club failed to meet the 31 July deadline to settle all wage debts."}

Other scientists think they are all one species.\nThis cat lives in many kinds of habitats: cloud forests, swamps, scrublands, and grasslands.\nThis cat mostly eats small rodents such as guinea pigs and mice, but they also catch birds, for example flamingoes. Scientists saw pampas cats going to penguin nests to eat eggs and baby penguins. Farmers say that this cat can kill goats and chickens.\nIn most of the countries where the pampas cat lives, it is illegal to kill one. The pampas cat is in danger of dying out because humans are using or want to use the land that it lives on for farms. Indigenous people of the South America like the pampas cat because it is a sign of fertility and they believe killing a pampas cat brings bad luck. But the same people also like to have a dead pampas cat's skin or whole body for ceremonies.\nThis cat's body is 42 to 79 cm long and its tail is another 22 to 33 cm long. It can weigh 3 to 4 kg. Its fur is thick and long. It can be pale yellow to dark gray-brown or dark dull red in color. It can have stripes or spots or not. It almost always has rings on its legs and tail.\nThe first visual recordings of the pampas cat, a movie and photos, were made in 2006."}

Eventually, many of the Liechtensteiner emigrants of Dubuque left the city and got farms nearby. However, the Liechtensteiner emigration was reduced during the American Civil War (1861-1865). Later, when the construction of railroads began \"lying the country together and opening up the West\", other Liechtensteiners emigrated to United States to work in the construction of railroads.\nDuring the following decades, many other Liechtensteiners emigrated to places such as Guttenberg, Iowa and Wabash, Indiana. However, between 1885 and 1907, Liechtensteiner emigration slowed, limited to a few individuals and families. Less than 30 Liechtensteiners emigrated during that period to United States. Reducing migration was due to the large increase in economic activity from the establishment of first textile factories in the 1880s.\nThe First World War caused an economic crisis in Liechtenstein (which originated, among other things, because the Entente allies stopped the \"import of raw materials\" into the country and the \"massive speculation by the national bank\"), so the Liechtenstein emigration to United States was retaken. Most of the new Liechtensteiner emigrants settled in urban areas, especially in Chicago and Hammond, Indiana, but there were Liechtensteiners throughout the country.\nAfter the Second World War, a few more Liechtensteiners emigrated to the United States, the largest number arriving in 1948, when fifteen individuals or families came to this country. The reduction of the Liechtenstein emigration was due to improvements in economic conditions of Liechtenstein."}

The thermal energy in a solid or liquid shakes the atoms so they randomly vibrate, but this gets less as the temperature drops. Electrons carry the same negative electric charge which makes them repel each other. At higher temperatures each unbound electron behaves as if it were a free particle. There is also however a very weak attraction between electrons when they are in any solid or liquid. This is due to the way bound electrons distort the spacing of the atomic structure they find themselves in. At relatively rather large distances (many hundreds of nanometers apart) and low temperatures (near absolute zero), the attractive effect and lack of thermal energy allows pairs of electrons to hang together. This is called a cooper pair and it is a quasiparticle, that is it acts as if it were a new kind of particle in its own right even though it is made up of two fundamental electrons. \nMany overlapping cooper pairs can exist in the same nanometer sized space. Since paired electrons constitute a boson the motions of all of the cooper pairs within a single superconductor synchronise and they function as if they are a single entity. This is known as the Bose\u2013Einstein condensation. The Cooper pairs form this condensate, which is superfluid or super-conducting. Small disturbances such as scattering of electrons are forbidden in this state as long as the temperature remains low. It moves as one showing no resistance to its motion. It is hence now a superconductor."}

A happiness pump is someone who will do anything to make other people happy even if it makes them very unhappy themselves. They have turned themselves into a machine (a \"pump\") that makes happiness.\nThe happiness pump is a way of showing problems in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a moral philosophy. It is a way of deciding which actions are good and which are bad. In utilitarianism, actions that make more happiness or stop pain are good. Actions that stop happiness or make pain are bad. In utilitarianism, it does not matter who is becoming happier or feeling less pain. That means that, in utilitarianism, helping strangers is good. The happiness pump is a person who has taken utilitarianism too far and will give themselves lots of pain so long as they believe it makes other people somewhere in the world much happier.\nThe happiness pump is only an idea. Philosopher Joshua David Greene says it is almost impossible to be a happiness pump for real. People who even tried would give up.\nIn popular culture.\nA happiness pump character is on one episode of the television show \"The Good Place\"."}

He helped Benedict Arnold change sides to the British army and tried to take West Point. He was executed for being a spy.\nEarly life.\nAndr\u00e9 was born in 1750 in London.\nHis parents were Huguenots. The Huguenots were Protestants who had lived in France. When the French government said it was illegal to be Protestants, many Huguenots went to other countries. Andr\u00e9's mother went to England when she was young. His mother had been born in France and his father had been born in Geneva. Andr\u00e9's father was a merchant. Andr\u00e9's parents had one other son and three daughters.\nAndr\u00e9 went to school in Geneva and then came back to England in 1767. He had a good education. He could draw, paint, play the flute, write poems, and speak English, French, German, and Italian.\nAndr\u00e9 wanted to join the army, but at that time, people did not become officers unless they could buy the position. When Andr\u00e9's father died in 1769, Andr\u00e9 had to make money to take care of his family. He became a merchant in his father's business.\nAndr\u00e9 fell in love with an English woman named Honora Sneyd. But Sneyd's guardians would not let them marry unless Andr\u00e9 became rich. Andr\u00e9 worked hard to be a good merchant. But then Honora Sneyd changed her mind. Then Andr\u00e9 joined the army. According to Sneyd's foster sister, Anna Seward, Andr\u00e9 joined the army out of a broken heart.\nArmy career.\nAndr\u00e9 joined the army on March 4, 1771. He did special training in Germany for two years. In 1774, he went to Canada with the Royal English Fusileers. He was a lieutenant at the time. Andr\u00e9 helped defend St. John's from the American army. The siege lasted two months, and the British lost.\nAndr\u00e9 was captured at St. John's. Because he was an officer and not an enlisted man, he was held prisoner in inns instead of barracks and ate dinner with rich people. Andr\u00e9 was kept prisoner in the house of the Cope family in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Many people in Lancaster County spoke German, and so could Andr\u00e9, so he made friends. Andr\u00e9 also taught art to the Copes' son.\nIn 1776, Andr\u00e9 was sent back to the British army. He was traded for American prisoners. He wrote a book about everything he had learned about the British Colonies and drew maps of places he had been. He gave the book to British General William Howe in New York City. Howe thought the book was very good and that Andr\u00e9 was very intelligent. He promoted Andr\u00e9 to captain and made him aide to Major-General Charles Grey.\nAndr\u00e9 was part of the invasion of Philadelphia in 1777. At the time, Philadelphia was the largest city in the thirteen colonies. The British captured it. Andr\u00e9 fought in the Battle of Brandywine, the Paoli Massacre, the Battle of Germantown, the Battle of Monmouth, and Grey's raids into Massachusetts and New Jersey in 1778. Andr\u00e9 kept a personal book during this time. That book is now a valuable historical source about the war.\nDuring the winter of 1777-1778, there was less fighting because it was too cold and snowy. John Andr\u00e9 lived in Philadelphia in Benjamin Franklin's house. He wrote poetry for women, for example Peggy Shippen. He also threw a large party called the Mischianza to honor General Howe and his brother, Admiral Richard Howe. When the British left Philadelphia, Andr\u00e9 packed up and stole many of Benjamin Franklin's inventions, books, and other things. Historians think General Grey may have ordered him to do this.\nIn 1778, Andr\u00e9 was promoted to major and deputy Adjutant General.\nIn May of 1779, Benedict Arnold, a high-ranking American officer, told Andr\u00e9 he wanted to change sides if the British would give him \u00a310,000 and high rank in the British military. He was the commander of the fort West Point. If the British had West Point, they could control the Hudson Valley and they would be much stronger in New England. Andr\u00e9 and Arnold sent letters to each other for months.\nIn 1779, Andr\u00e9 went with General Clinton to attack Charleston, South Carolina, and they won. Andr\u00e9 returned north with Clinton and began talking to Arnold again. Arnold said he had to meet Andr\u00e9 in person to plan the surrender of West Point.\nCapture and trial.\nIn September 1779, Andr\u00e9 got on a ship and sailed up the Hudson. He met Arnold, who gave him papers and the plans to West Point. But Andr\u00e9 could not get back to his ship because American forces had attacked it, and it had sailed away. Andr\u00e9 decided to go back to British territory in disguise. He took off his British army uniform and put on ordinary clothes. On the way, he was captured by American freelance soldiers. They found the papers Arnold had given Andr\u00e9. They arrested Andr\u00e9 as a spy.\nBecause Andr\u00e9 had been in disguise and not wearing his uniform, he was legally a spy and not only an enemy soldier. The punishment for being a spy was much worse. Andr\u00e9 was put on trial in Tappan, New York. Many of his friends wrote letters to George Washington to ask that he be allowed to live. Others asked that he be allowed to die by firing squad, which was the usual way soldiers were killed. On September 29, 1780, Andr\u00e9 was found guilty of being \"under a feigned name and in a disguised habit.\" He was sentenced to die by hanging. Andr\u00e9 was hanged at noon on October 2, 1780.\nBurial.\nAt first, Andr\u00e9 was buried next to the Hudson River. A peach tree grew on top of his grave. In 1782, King George III had a monument built for Andr\u00e9 in Westminster Abbey.\nIn 1821, people dug up John Andr\u00e9's bones and took them to England. He is buried in Westminster Abbey. They took the peach tree too and replanted it in the king's garden. There is another monument in Tappan, New York.\nIn popular culture.\nA fictional John Andr\u00e9 is in the television series \"Turn\"."}

The first version was planned for the first half of 2020. On June 22, 2020, at the time of the beta3 release, version 1.0 was pushed back to autumn 2020. On October 27th 2020, the first version was officially launched and presented through visual guide. On November 17 new version 1.02. was released with few updates and numerous new languages supported. Independent developer of Fedilab released an Android app for Mobilizon.\nIn January 2021 over 60 active Mobilizon instances were recorded in the registry.\nFunctionality.\nMobilizon offers the following features:\nSome of the features were also inspired by needs of activists and some of the features known from Facebook UX were intentionally avoided:\n\"\"We also understood that Mobilizon had to move away from the Facebook-style social features that exploit our ego and motor the attention economy. In the Mobilizon we designed, there are no likes, incentives to create the narrative of your life on a wall, and no echo chambers to these frustrating dialogues where everyone shouts and no one listens\".\"\nTechnology.\nThe software is written in the Elixir programming language with Phoenix, a lightweight framework that takes advantage of Elixir.\nThe user interface is built with the VueJS framework.\nMobilizon is federated to a network of instances capable of communicating with each other thanks to the ActivityPub protocol, a W3C standard. It will also enable interaction with other software applications that make up the fediverse, such as Mastodon, PeerTube, etc. Most federation code comes from Pleroma, popular microbloging software."}

It officially began on June\u00a01, 2021, and will end on November\u00a030, 2021. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most Atlantic tropical cyclones form. However, tropical cyclogenesis is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the early formation of Subtropical Storm Ana on May 22, making 2021 the seventh consecutive year that a storm formed before the official start of the season. In June 3 named storms formed during the month making June 2021 the most active June since 1968 and also tied with 1886, 1909, and 1936.\nStarting this season, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to issue regular Tropical Weather Outlooks on May 15, two weeks earlier than it did in the past. This change was implemented in light of the fact that named systems had formed in the Atlantic Ocean prior to the official start of the season in each of the preceding six seasons.\nSystems.\nTropical Storm Ana.\nTropical Storm Ana was the first tropical cyclone of the year. This storm threatened Bermuda, warranting a Tropical Storm Watch, but it did not affect that area. It moved northeast and dissipated on May 24. This storm formed before hurricane season officially begun, continuing the 7-year streak of pre-season systems.\nTropical Storm Bill.\nTropical Storm Bill threatened the East Coast of the United States as it formed into Tropical Depression Two, but it did not affect that reigon and continued northeast into the Atlantic Ocean, south of Canada, and dissipated on June 16.\nTropical Storm Claudette.\nTropical Storm Claudette formed just off the coast of Louisiana and made landfall in eastern Terrebonne Parish, and weakened to a tropical depression travelled across Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, and southern Virginia before moving into the Atlantic, reintensifying into a tropical storm on June 21 and turning post-tropical the next day. The storm later dissipated the next day. This storm killed 14 people in Alabama, 4 of which were direct.\nTropical Storm Danny.\nTropical Storm Danny formed off the coast of South Carolina and made landfall in that state. This made Danny the first June storm to make landfall in South Carolina since Hurricane One in 1867. It dissipated inland the next day. \nHurricane Elsa.\nTropical Storm Elsa formed on the early morning hours of July 1, 2021, and intensified into a tropical storm later that day. This made it the earliest fifth tropical cyclone to form in the Atlantic since reliable records begun in 1851. This is also the second earliest storm to form this far east in the Main Development Region, only behind the 1933 Trinidad hurricane. This storm rapidly moved towards the Lesser Antillies at 30\u00a0mph after it became a tropical storm.\nHurricane Ida.\nHurricane Ida was a powerful Category 4 hurricane that affected Gulf Coast of the United States, Southeastern United States, and Northeastern United States in late August 2021 into early September 2021. Ida was the ninth named storm, and fourth hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Ida originated from a tropical wave first monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on August 23, moving into the Caribbean Sea and developing into a tropical storm on August 26. On August 27, Ida became a Category 1 hurricane and initiated rapid intensification on the next day, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC on August 28.\nStorm names.\nThese names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2021. Retired names, if any, will be announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2022. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2027 season. This is the same list used in the 2015 season, with the exceptions of \"Elsa\" and \"Julian\", which replaced \"Erika\" and \"Joaquin\". The names \"Elsa\", \"Julian\", \"Rose\", \"Sam\", \"Teresa\", \"Victor\", and \"Wanda\" was used for the first time this year.\nSeason effects.\nThis is a table of all of the storms that have formed in the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s)\u2013denoted by bold location names \u2013 damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2021 USD."}

Rotation about the horizontal axis varies the altitude (angle of elevation) of the pointing direction.\nIt was popularised by John Dobson in 1965. It increased the size of telescopes for amateur astronomers. Dobson's telescopes had a simplified mechanical design that was easy to make from readily available components. It made a large, portable, low-cost telescope. \nThe design works for looking at faint, deep-sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies. This type of observation needs a large objective diameter (i.e. light-gathering power) of relatively short focal length. It can be taken to less light-polluted places."}

It made up of center-right and right-wing political parties and led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It was founded in 1998. It currently controls the Indian union government as well as the government of 18 Indian states.\nIts first chairman was Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. L. K. Advani, the former Deputy Prime Minister, took over as chairman in 2004 and served until 2014. Afetr that, Amit Shah has been the chairman since 2014. The coalition ruled from 1998 to 2004. The alliance returned to power in the 2014 general elections with a combined vote share of 38.5%. Its leader, Narendra Modi, was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. In the 2019 general election, the alliance further increased its tally to 353 seats with combined vote share of 45.43%.\nHistory.\nThe NDA was formed in May 1998 as a coalition to contest the general elections. The main aim of the NDA was to form a anti-Congress coalition. It was led by the BJP, and included several regional parties, including the Samta Party and the AIADMK, as well as Shiv Sena, the only member which shared the Hindutva ideology of the BJP. After the election, it was able to muster a slim majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party, allowing Atal Bihari Vajpayee to return as prime minister.\nThe government collapsed within a year because the AIADMK withdrew its support. After the entry of a few more regional parties, the NDA proceeded to win the 1999 elections with a larger majority. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for a third time, and this time served a full five-year term.\nThe NDA called elections in early 2004, six months ahead of schedule. Its campaign was based around the slogan of \"India Shining\" which attempted to depict the NDA government. It responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country. However, the NDA suffered a defeat. They won with only a 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress, with Manmohan Singh. Singh has succeeded Vajpayee as prime minister. Commentators have argued that the NDA's defeat was due to a failure to reach out to the rural masses.\nStructure.\nThe National Democratic Alliance does not have a formal governing structure such as an executive board or politburo. It has been up to the leaders of the individual parties to make decisions on issues such as sharing of seats in elections, allocation of ministries and the issues that are raised in Parliament. Given the varied ideologies among the parties, there have been many cases of disagreement and split voting among the allies.\nOwing to ill health, George Fernandes, who was the NDA convener until 2008, was discharged of his responsibility. He replaced by Sharad Yadav, the then national president of the JD(U) party. On 16 June 2013, the JD(U) left the coalition and Sharad Yadav resigned from the role of the NDA convener. Then the CM of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu was made the NDA convener.\nOn 27 July 2017 JD(U) with the help of BJP formed the government in Bihar. Later, on 19 August 2017 JD(U) formally rejoined the NDA after 4 years.\nCurrent governments.\nAs of March 2020, the BJP holds a majority of Legislative Assembly in 12 states - Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. In Haryana, BJP shares power as the senior partner (Chief Minister of BJP) with Jannayak Janta Party."}

Heine said that the shark is \"saying something about CND, nuclear power, Chernobyl and Nagasaki\".\nOn August 2007, the shark was renovated by Buckley. This was because of complaints of the quality of the sculpture.\nOn 26 August 2016, Heine's son Magnus Hanson-Heine bought the house. He bought it so that the shark can stay on top of the house.\nControversy.\nThe shark started controversy when it was first put on the house. Oxford City Council wanted the shark removed from the house because it was not safe for the people living near. There were no planning permissions for the shark. In 1992, Minister Tony Baldry from the Department of the Environment said that the shark can stay on the house because it does not cause any problems."}

There must be an appeal to the umpire at the bowler's end, and he makes the decision.\nLBW happens when the ball touches a batsman's body before it touches the bat or a hand/glove holding the bat, and the ball would otherwise have hit the wicket. \nLeg before wicket first appeared in the laws of cricket in 1774, as batsmen began to use their pads to prevent the ball hitting their wicket.\nDefinition.\nThe definition of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, written by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). \nBefore a batter can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no-ball \u2014 an illegal delivery \u2014 the batter cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. \nOtherwise, for the batter to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must hit the pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. For a right-handed batsman, the off side is the right-hand side of the pitch when viewed from his perspective. For a left-handed batsman, the off side is the left-hand side. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his/her bat, In the Laws of Cricket, the batsman's bat is considered to include the hand or hands holding it. in line with the wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. \nThe batter may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with their bat, they are struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batter, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.\nInstant replay.\nSometimes video replay and other technologies are used to decide if a batter is out LBW. For example, heat-tracking (\"Hot Spot\") can visually show when the ball has hit the bat or part of the batter's body, audio-tracking (\"Snickometer\") can show if there is a slight sound from the impact of the ball, and advanced simulations (\"Hawkeye\") can predict where the ball would have gone after impact with the batter's body if the batter had not been there."}

Most of the leaders decided to fight small battles and win slowly.\nGeneral George Washington and General Charles Lee led the Continental Army to Englishtown. There, Washington ordered the army to attack British General Sir Henry Clinton's army. During the battle, Lee ordered his own Continental troops to retreat. Washington became angry and ordered Lee and \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne to slow the British down while he, Washington, took command. The Continental Army defended its position while the British attacked all day. That night, the British left in the dark.\nThere were about 10,000 Continental troops and about 11,000 British troops. About 100 British troops were killed or injured and about 150 Continentals. About 100 people fell or died from heatstroke. George Washington's horse also died of heatstroke.\nJune 28 was a very hot day. Mary Ludwig Hayes brought water to her husband and other gunners during the battle many times. One time, she brought water and found her husband had been shot and injured. She took over his job as gunner. People gave her the nickname \"Molly Pitcher.\" There may have been more than one real-life woman who was given the name \"Molly Pitcher.\"\nNathanael Greene and the Marquis de Lafayette also fought in this battle.\nWeapons.\nBoth armies had muskets. The Highland Scots in the British army also had broadswords. The British and the German soldiers had bayonets, long blades attached to the ends of the muskets. The Continental army had been trying to get bayonets. Some of the Virginia troops had rifled firearms.\nThis was the first time the Continental army used the tactics and training they had learned at Valley Forge from then-Acting Inspector General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben.\nOutcome.\nGeneral Lee asked to be court-martialed for his actions in this battle. He was sentenced to one year suspension.\nAfter the Battle of Monmouth, the war moved to the South.\nToday.\nReenactors reenact the battle at Monmouth Battlefield State Park in Freehold, New Jersey."}

He is also known for being a naturist.\nWork on the lava lamp.\nWalker got the idea of a lava lamp from seeing what is now called a \"blob light\", a mix of oil and water heated by a lightbulb at the bottom. He thought it would look more interesting if the oil was thick enough to form shapes, and spent 10 years trying to make it good.\nEventually, his product was launched in 1963, and Walker's factory soon began production of it as it grew in popularity.\nApparently, Walker once said, \"If you buy my lamp, you won't need drugs.\"\nLava lamps were featured in the sitcom series \"Absolutely Fabulous\", which some people think helped the lava lamp's popularity, which was declining at the time.\nEventually, as it become less popular in the 1980s, Walker sold the company to Elizabeth Granger. Her company, Mathmos, was one of Britain's fastest growing companies, mostly from the lava lamp. Walker believed the lava lamp would be good for her company.\n\"I think it will always be popular.\" he once said. \"It's like the cycle of life. It grows, breaks up, falls down, and starts all over again.\" \nNaturism.\nWalker's interest in nudity began with a visit to the Isle du Levant in the 1950s. He liked the idea, and tried to make it popular. \"Eves on Skies\" was broadcast in 1958, and \"Travelling Light\" followed soon after in 1960.\nThe success of Travelling Light gave Walker the money to buy a nightclub in Bournemouth. He turned it into a nudist resort. He tried to ban overweight nudists from entering, but failed.\n\"We are all against these fat fogies, it's not what naturism is about,\" he said\nDeath.\nWalker was suffering from cancer in the mid and late 1990s, and he eventually died because of it. He died in Ringwood, Hampshire at the age of 85 on the 15th of August 2000."}

Smiley is polite, shy and humble. He often allows others to mistreat him, especially his unfaithful wife. But his humility masks his inner cunning, excellent memory, mastery of tradecraft, and occasional ruthlessness. His genius being underestimated helps Smiley achieve his goals. In the end, he becomes one of the most powerful agents in Britain.\nThe character is held in high esteem in Britain, where he has become a pop-culture icon on par with Bond. \"The Guardian\" called him \"the sort of spy [Britain] believes it ought to have: a bit shabby, academic, basically loyal, and sceptical of... his political masters\"."}

She knew Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, the Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson.\nEarly life and family.\nAngelica was born in 1756. She grew up in Albany, New York. Her parents were Philip Schuyler and Catharine Van Rensselaer Schuyler. Philip Schuyler had fought in the French and Indian War. He went to the New York State Assembly and Continental Congress. During the Revolutionary War, Philip Schuyler was a Major General in the Continental Army. Her parents had fifteen children, and eight lived to be adults. Angelica's sister Elizabeth would later marry Alexander Hamilton. The Schuyler family had almost twenty slaves.\nHistorian Danielle Funiciello of the Schuyler Museum says the Schuyler daughters probably learned French, dancing, geography, history, writing, arithmetic, music, needlework, and how to run a household. Because about half of Albany spoke Dutch as a first language, the Schuylers probably spoke Dutch. Because Angelica could read in French, she could read philosophy.\nAfter the war, Philip Schuyler was a senator in the New York state government and then senator for New York in the United States government.\nMarriage and life in Europe.\nAngelica Schuyler married a British man called John Barker Church in 1777. At the time, John Barker Church was using a false name, John Carter. He had changed his name and left England because he owed people money from gambling. She ran away to marry him because she thought her parents would not want them to marry. Her parents were angry and would not speak to her for days. Her mother's parents talked to her parents until they changed their minds.\nJohn Barker Church made a lot of money selling supplies to the French and Continental armies during the war. He was General George Washington's Commissary General. He also made money buying land and selling it later.\nIn 1783, Angelica Schuyler Church, her husband, and their four children moved from the United States to France. John Barker Church was an envoy from the United States government to the government of France. In Paris, Angelica Schuyler Church made friends with Benjamin Franklin, the Marquis de Lafayette, the Marquis de Tallyrand and Thomas Jefferson. She introduced Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway.\nIn 1785, the Churches moved to London, where Angelica Schuyler Church made friends with some people in the royal family. John Barker Church became a member of Parliament. They visited the United States twice. They visited once in 1785. They visited again in 1789 because Angelica Schuyler Church had been invited to George Washington's inauguration, the ceremony where he officially became the first President of the United States.\nThe Churches moved back to the United States in 1797.\nLegacy.\nJohn Barker Church had given supplies to the Americans during the Revolutionary War. At the time, he told them they could pay him later. Because the American government realized they could not pay him at all, they gave him land in New York State instead. They gave him 100,000 acres on the Genesee River. Angelica and John's son Philip Church designed and built a town there, Angelica, New York, named after his mother.\nAngelica Schuyler Church died on March 13, 1814.\nIn popular culture.\nAngelica is a character in the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Miranda said he had to make changes so the story of the musical would make sense. For example, in the musical, Angelica gets married after Elizabeth and Alexander Hamilton do, instead of before."}

{"id": "810325", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=810325", "title": "Names of Vietnam", "text": "Throughout history of Vietnam, besides official names, there are names that are used unofficially to refer to the territory of Vietnam. Vietnam was ever called V\u0103n Lang during the H\u00f9ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng Dynasty, \u00c2u L\u1ea1c when An D\u01b0\u01a1ng was king, Nam Vi\u1ec7t during the Tri\u1ec7u Dynasty, Van Xuan during the Anterior L\u00fd Dynasty, \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t during the \u0110inh dynasty and Early L\u00ea dynasty. Starting in 1054, Vietnam was called \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (Great Viet). During the H\u1ed3 dynasty, Vietnam was called \u0110\u1ea1i Ngu.\nVi\u1ec7t Nam ( in Vietnamese) is a variation of Nam Vi\u1ec7t (Southern Vi\u1ec7t), a name that can be traced back to the Tri\u1ec7u dynasty (2nd century BC, also known as Nanyue Kingdom). The word \"Vi\u1ec7t\" originated as a shortened form of B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t, a word used to refer to a people who lived in what is now southern China in ancient times. The word \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam\", with the syllables in the modern order, first appears in the 16th century in a poem by Nguy\u1ec5n B\u1ec9nh Khi\u00eam. \"Annam\", which originated as a Chinese name in the seventh century, was the common name of the country during the colonial period. Nationalist writer Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u revived the name \"Vietnam\" in the early 20th century. When rival communist and anti-communist governments were set up in 1945, both immediately adopted this as the country's official name. In English, the two syllables are usually combined into one word, \"Vietnam\". However, \"Viet Nam\" was once common usage and is still used by the United Nations and by the Vietnamese government.\nOrigin of \"Vietnam\".\nThe term \"\" (Yue) (), Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"\u6209\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as \"\u8d8a\". At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Vi\u1ec7t referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people.\nFrom the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam, with particular states or groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t). The term Baiyue/B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t first appeared in the book \"L\u00fcshi Chunqiu\" compiled around 239 BC.\nIn 207 BC, former Qin dynasty general Zhao Tuo/Tri\u1ec7u \u0110\u00e0 founded the kingdom Nanyue/Nam Vi\u1ec7t with its capital at Panyu (modern Guangzhou). This kingdom was \"southern\" because it was south of other Baiyue kingdoms such as Minyue and Ouyue, in modern Fujian and Zhejiang. Several later Vietnamese dynasties followed this nomenclature even after these more northern peoples were absorbed into China.\nIn \"S\u1ea5m Tr\u1ea1ng Tr\u00ecnh\" (The Prophecies of Tr\u1ea1ng Tr\u00ecnh), poet Nguyen Binh Khi\u00eam (1491\u20131585) reversed the traditional order of the syllables and put the name in its modern form: \"Vietnam is being created\" (). At this time, the country was divided between the Tr\u1ecbnh lords of Hanoi and the Nguy\u1ec5n lords of Hu\u1ebf. By combining several existing names, Nam Vi\u1ec7t, Annam (Pacified South), \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (Great Vi\u1ec7t), and \"Nam qu\u1ed1c\" (southern nation), Khi\u00eam could create a new name that referred to an aspirational unified state. The word \"nam\" no longer implies Southern Vi\u1ec7t, but rather that Vietnam is \"the South\" in contrast to China, \"the North\". This explanation is implied by L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t in the poem \"Nam qu\u1ed1c s\u01a1n h\u00e0\" (1077): \"Over the mountains and rivers of the South, reigns the emperor of the South.\" Researcher Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Gi\u00e1c H\u1ea3i found the word \u8d8a\u5357 \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam\" on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at B\u1ea3o L\u00e2m Pagoda, Haiphong (1558). Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Chu (1675\u20131725) used the word in a poem: \"This is the most dangerous mountain in Vietnam\" (). It was used as an official name by Emperor Gia Long in 1804-1813. The Jiaqing Emperor refused Gia Long's request to change his country's name to Nam Vi\u1ec7t, and changed the name instead to Vi\u1ec7t Nam. Gia Long's \u0110\u1ea1i Nam th\u1ef1c l\u1ee5c contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming.\nThe use of \"Vietnam\" was revived in modern times by nationalists including Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, whose book \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam vong qu\u1ed1c s\u1eed\" (History of the Loss of Vietnam) was published in 1906. Chau also founded the Vi\u1ec7t Nam Quang Ph\u1ee5c H\u1ed9i (Vietnam Restoration League) in 1912. However, the general public continued to use Annam and the name \"Vietnam\" remained virtually unknown until the Y\u00ean B\u00e1i mutiny of 1930, organized by the Vi\u1ec7t Nam Qu\u1ed1c D\u00e2n \u0110\u1ea3ng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party). By the early 1940s, the use of \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam\" was widespread. It appeared in the name of Ho Chi Minh's Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Viet Minh), founded 1941, and was even used by the governor of French Indochina in 1942. The name \"Vietnam\" has been official since 1945. It was adopted in June by B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's imperial government in Hu\u1ebf, and in September by Ho's rival communist government in Hanoi.\nCulture.\nIn English, the spellings Vietnam, Viet-Nam, and Viet Nam have all been used. The 1954 edition of \"Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary\" gave both the unspaced and hyphenated forms; in response to a letter from a reader, the editors indicated that the spaced form Viet Nam was also acceptable, though they stated that because Anglophones did not know the meaning of the two words making up the name Vietnam, \"it is not surprising\" that there was a tendency to drop the space. In 1966, the U.S. government was known to use all three renderings, with the State Department preferring the hyphenated version. By 1981, the hyphenated form was regarded as \"dated\", according to Scottish writer Gilbert Adair, and he titled his book about depictions of the country in film using the unhyphenated and unspaced form \"Vietnam\".\nThe modern Chinese name for Vietnam () can be translated as \"Beyond the South\", leading to the folk etymology that the name is a reference to the country's location beyond the southernmost borders of China. Another theory explains that the nation was termed as such in order to emphasize the division of those who stayed in China in contrast to the people living in Vietnam.\nBoth Japanese and Korean formerly referred to Vietnam by their respective Sino-Xenic pronunciations of the Chinese characters for its names, but later switched to using direct phonetic transcriptions. In Japanese, following the independence of Vietnam the names and were largely replaced by the phonetic transcription , written in katakana script; however, the old form is still seen in compound words (e.g. , \"a visit to Vietnam\"). Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sometimes used an alternative spelling . Similarly, in the Korean language, in line with the trend towards decreasing usage of hanja, the Sino-Korean-derived name \"Wollam\" (, the Korean reading of ) has been replaced by \"Beteunam\" () in South Korea and \"Wennam\" () in North Korea."}

At Valley Forge, he taught the Continental Army how to fight the European way.\nEarly life.\nSteuben was born September 17, 1730 in Magdeburg. At the time, Magdeburg was in the Kingdom of Prussia.\nSteuben's father worked with engineers in the 1744 Siege of Prague.\nSteuben joined the Prussian army when he was 16. He learned that the Prussian army was a good army because it was very disciplined. He became a lieutenant. He fought in the Seven Years War. He became a captain. He worked for General Johann von Mayer. In 1762, he was aide-de-camp to Frederick the Great. Steuben was in the army 17 years.\nIn 1763, Steuben was pushed out of the army because there was peace and the government wanted the army to be smaller.\nMiddle career.\nSteuben went to work for the court of a small German country called Hohenzollern-Hechingen. In 1769, the prince of Baden added Steuben to the chivalric Order of Fidelity. That meant Steuben was allowed to use the title \"Freiherr\", meaning \"free lord,\" or \"baron.\"\nIn America.\nIn 1777, Hohenzollern-Hechingen lost its money, and von Steuben needed a new job. He looked for army jobs in Europe, but Europe was mostly at peace. He looked for a job with the Prince of Baden, but someone told stories that von Steuben had \"taken liberties with young boys,\" meaning someone called him a pedophile.\nThe Revolutionary War had started in North America. Von Steuben looked for a job with the Continental Army. He went to France and met Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane. Franklin and Deane wanted von Steuben to help the Continental Army, so they wrote to the Continental Congress. They lied and said he had been a general in the Prussian army (he had really only been a captain). They told other lies too. They did this because many, many Europeans from rich or noble families wanted to fight in the Continental Army. Many of them expected to be generals, but the Continental Army was not large enough for so many generals. Also, many of them had not fought in wars before, and the Continental Congress sent them home. Franklin and Deane knew that only a very, very good story would make Congress hire von Steuben.\nVon Steuben came to America in 1777. He told Congress he did not mind if he was not a general. He told the Continental Congress that they only had to pay him if they won the war. They hired him.\nVon Steuben went to Valley Forge and met General George Washington. Washington made von Steuben Acting Inspector General and told him to teach the Continental Army soldiers how to fight the European way.\nVon Steuben taught the soldiers how to drill, meaning he made them practice marching, shooting, and fighting together until they were good fighters. He made all the officers use the same drills so the soldiers would not be confused in a real battle. He also told Washington and Congress which weapons and supplies they should buy, for example bayonets.\nVon Steuben did not speak English well. Instead, he cursed at the soldiers in French and German. The Continental soldiers liked him anyway.\nOne problem with the Continental Army was that the officers who did drill their men sometimes used different drills. This made the soldiers confused in real battles. Von Steuben, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Alexander Hamilton wrote one drill book for the whole Continental Army, the Blue Book. The American military used it until after the War of 1812.\nVon Steuben wrote to a friend, \"The genius of this nation is not in the least to be compared with that of the Prussian, Austrians, or French. You say to your soldier 'Do this and he doeth it'; but I am obliged to say [to the American soldier]: 'This is the reason why you ought to do that: and then he does it.'\"\nAfter the Battle of Monmouth, Congress gave von Steuben the rank Major General. He led soldiers at the Battle of Yorktown and other battles.\nLater life.\nVon Steuben died in November 28, 1794 at his home in New York State.\nSexuality.\nVon Steuben was accused of being a pedophile, but it was never proven.\nHistorians today believe von Steuben was homosexual, meaning he had relationships with other adult men. It was an open secret, meaning that Washington and other people knew von Steuben was homosexual and decided not to talk about it."}

It is also known as the architecture of classical antiquity. Many features of classical architecture come from the writing of the Roman architect Vitruvius.\nDifferent styles of classical architecture might have existed since the Carolingian Renaissance. Styles have definitely existed since the Italian Renaissance. \nClassical architecture buildings can be very different, but all classical architecture uses the same common design features. These features are structural and visual. \nIn much of Europe and America, from the Renaissance until World War Two, classical architecture was very popular and important to architecture. It is still important today, but less than it has been in history. \nThe term classical architecture is also used to talk about any type of architecture that has become a very specific style. For example, classical Chinese architecture, or classical Mayan architecture. The words \"traditional\" and \"vernacular\" can mean something different to \"classical\", or something similar. \nThe phrases New Classical and Neoclassical describe classical architecture that was built in modern times.\nHistory.\nWhere and when?\nClassical architecture comes from the architecture of ancient Greece and ancient Rome. After the west part of the Roman empire stopped existing, no Roman architecture was built in most of western Europe. \nIn the Carolingian Renaissance, which happened in the 8th and 9th centuries, people started bringing back classical architecture. For example, the gatehouse of Lorsch Abbey (c.800 AD) in Germany looks like the Colosseum in Rome. The Colosseum is a very important piece of classical architecture. \nMany styles of architecture have features of classical architecture. For example, Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic architecture. But these styles do not try to exactly copy the traditions of classical architecture. For example, the idea of putting specific spaces between columns. So these styles are not thought of as classical architecture.\nHow it changed.\nBy the time the Italian Renaissance started, Gothic architecture was not used much anymore. Architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Sebastiano Serlio, and Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola started trying to bring back the style of architecture used in ancient Rome.\nThey did this by reading a paper called \"De architectura\", which was written by Vitruvius. Vitruvius was an architect in ancient Rome, and his paper has a lot of information about classical architecture and its features. The architects also looked at the old buildings in Rome and Italy. \nThe classical architecture from the Renaissance shows that classical ideas were used in a very specific way. Some of the ideas they used had no clear origin in ancient architecture. For example, the Ospedale degli Innocenti building in Florence was built by Filippo Bruncelleschi, and is one of the earliest Renaissance buildings. It was finished in 1445. But the columns on the building do not look exactly like the columns in Roman architecture. \nDuring the Renaissance, people learned about how ancient buildings were designed (the theory of classical architecture). They did not look at how every building was designed. This means classical architecture is not exactly the same as the old buildings it was based off. It is simplified, and buildings made after the Renaissance follow these simplified rules.\nMost of the architecture styles in Europe that were used after the Renaissance are classical architecture. This is a general use of the phrase \"classical architecture\". This general use is used by Sir John Summerson in The Classical Language of Architecture. The features of classical architecture have been used in different ways in different styles. For example, Baroque (or Rococo) architecture is different to classical architecture. Baroque or Rococo is based on classical architecture, but these styles have their own features, that are different to classical architecture. \nWhen Baroque architecture was used, people who learned about architecture still learned classical ideas. But they were not as important as during the Renaissance.\nPalladian architecture is a style based on classical architecture. It is based on the style of Andrea Palladio (1508-1580). He was an architect from Venice. His style was important even after he died. In Britain, it was used for many good buildings in the 18th and 19th century. The style was mixed with the Georgian architecture that Britain made at the time.\nAt around 1750, architects began copying classical architecture again. They did this because Baroque architecture only copied some of classical architecture. These architects wanted to make buildings that used all the features of classical architecture. The style they made was called Neoclassicism.\nNew findings in archaeology meant architects knew more about classical architecture than before. The architects wanted clear rules for making buildings. Some of the first Neoclassical thinkers were Claude Perrault, Marc-Antoine Laugier, and Carlo Lodoli. Some of the most important Neoclassical architects were \u00c9tienne-Louis Boull\u00e9e, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, Friedrich Gilly and John Soane. \nNeoclassical architecture was very important from 1750 to 1850. Neo-Gothic architecture was becoming more important at the same time. Neo-Gothic architecture was much less classical than Neoclassical. In the late 19th century, many styles of architecture were important. Many of the styles were not like classical architecture. For example, Art Nouveau and Eclecticism. \nClassical architecture was still important. Sometimes it would become very popular in one area. For example, Nordic Classicism was popular in the 1920s. But true classical architecture was never as popular as it was during the Renaissance.\nWhen Modernism became popular in the early 20hth century, classical architecture mostly stopped being used.\nRange of use.\nClassical styles were important in America and Europe for a long time. From the Renaissance until Modernism began, classical architecture was very important. This means the architecture of Ancient Greece and Rome was used and changed into most new architecture styles. \nArchitectural styles can come from classical architecture in different ways. For example, Neo-Palladian architecture is based on the buildings designed by Andrea Palladio, an architect from the Italian Renaissance. But Palladio based his architecture on Ancient Roman architecture. So Neo-Palladian architecture is based on classical architecture, even though it is mostly based on the works of Palladio.\nSome styles are not classical, like Gothic, but they have classical features. This means it is hard to judge classical architecture's range of use. \nThe most important part of classical architecture is features borrowed from ancient Greek and Roman architecture, and the rules architects made by learning about it.\n\"Petrification\".\nPetrification is a word used to show how ancient Greek builders changed from using wood to using stone. It also shows the effect this had on the classical architecture style.\nDuring the Archaic and early Classical times (6th and 5th centuries BC), early temples used a style of classical architecture called Doric.\nMost historians think that the oldest temples were made with wood. Then the most important features of the buildings were used to make new buildings. This meant the style was the same, and all the buildings followed the same rules. \nAfter that, in Greece, stone was used instead of wood. But they used the same style. Because the style was \"petrified\" and kept the same, the word \"petrification\" is used to show this.\nThe Greeks wanted the buildings to look the same as they did when they were made of wood. Historians think this had a religious reason. Nobody knows why exactly, because it was so long ago.\nMany places still used wood. For example, the Etruscans in Italy. Even though the Etruscans used some Greek culture and religion, they mostly kept using wood. The Etruscans knew how to use stone, but they didn't. They only started using stone when they became Roman."}

It was first shown on the Fox network on December 26, 1999. The episode is about the Griffin family after their city is destroyed from a nuclear explosion. This was because of Y2K (the Year 2000 problem). This is the first episode to have Mila Kunis as the voice actor for Meg Griffin.\nStory.\nThe city of Quahog gets ready for the 2000 New Year. Peter Griffin is worried that Y2K will be the end of the world. Lois tells him many times that the world will not end, but Peter puts his family in the basement of their house. However, Y2K causes many nuclear explosions and other problems through all of the world. The Griffin family is safe, but their house is destroyed. The explosions have caused many problems for Quahog. For example, Meg's boyfriend dies in an explosion, Quagmire and Cleveland are stitched together, and Quahog's news anchors eat each other. Peter eats all of the food that was in the house. Peter thinks that Twinkies are the only food that does not get bad in a nuclear explosion. The Griffin family starts walking to a Twinkie factory in Natick, Massachusetts.\nWhen they make it to Natick, they see a Twinkie factory that has no damage from the explosions. Peter makes a new town near the factory. Peter is the mayor and Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland are part of the town's council. The town becomes a community with many houses. When Peter sees that the town is very peaceful, he thinks the town is not protected. He makes guns for everyone in the town.
