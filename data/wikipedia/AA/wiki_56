Both types use and arrangement of a magnet and a coil of wire which will convert the vibrations into an electrical signal which can be stored in a computer for analysis. The earliest seismometer was developed by the Chinese. \nSeismologists can find the location of earthquakes by plotting received vibrations on a map. They can also pick up underground nuclear tests, and this is what many of the seismic recording stations were set up for.\nThey can also examine the crust in a seismic survey to try and find information about layers of rock, locate oil or gas fields and to get information about the internal structure of volcanos.

One hot day, she takes a bath inside her walled garden but she does not know that the judges are hiding inside the garden. The judges tell her to have sex with them but she doesn't want to. When she refuses, they tell the people of the village that they saw her having sex with a man who was not her husband. This is called adultery, which was against the law at that time. The people of the village believe the judges and want to kill Susanna. A boy named Daniel does not believe the judges, so he asks one of the judges to go away and the other one to say what he saw. Daniel does this again with the other judge. The judges tell different stories, showing that they lied. The people get mad and kill the judges instead."}

They and Nokturnal Mortum are two of the best-known exponents of the East European black metal scene. Lucifugum was formed in 1995 by poet/composer Khlyst and musicians Bal-a-Myth (guitar, bass) and Faunus (vocals). The band continues to perform, despite Faunus having left the band in 2001, and Bal-a-Myth having died in his sleep on October 5, 2002; the albums \"Back to Chopped Down Roots\" and \"Sociopath: Philosophy Cynicism\" were recorded in 2003 by numerous session musicians which, however, did not join the band. In 2004 Khlyst moved to the Ukrainian town Mykolayiv (Nikolaev) to continue the activity of Lucifugum and Propaganda together with local black metal musician Elena (aka Stabaath) (ex-Namtar, ex-Hesperus). \"Vector33\" is the first album with Stabaath (she recorded vocals, guitar, bass, and keyboards). All lyrics are written by Khlyst, and music is composed by Stabaath and Khlyst. Khlyst and Stabaath (real names Igor and Elena Naumchuk) are married. They are the owners of black metal label Propaganda.\nThe music of Lucifugum was different and changed during the years. The early period can be described as symphonic black metal (1996-2000), later it was black/thrash metal, sometimes with death metal touches (2001-2003), and after 2004 the music of the band has transformed into pure black metal style.\nAccording to Propaganda web site (details to album \u201cSublimessiah\u201d) Khlyst performs vocals since 2014. The critical problems with Stabaath\u2019s throat have stopped her during the record of the vocal. So, there are just 3 tracks (1,3,5) with Stabaath\u2019s vocals on \u201cSublimessiah\u201d."}

There are wild grasses, and there may be some trees. \nSeveral parts of the world have grasslands. Grasslands are found in Africa, North America, Central Asia, South America, and near the coasts of Australia. The largest grasslands are in East Africa. Grasslands with a few scattered trees are called savannas. Others are called prairies or steppes. \nVegetation.\nGrassland vegetation can vary greatly in height. The chalk grassland of southern England is quite short, often with small, delicate flowers. \nGrass is quite tall in the Mississippi \"tallgrass prairie\", the South American grasslands and the African savannas. This provides a degree of cover for the smaller animals, and so increases the number of species which can live there.\nWoody plants, shrubs or trees, may occur on some grasslands. The root systems of perennial grasses and forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) form complex mats that hold the soil in place.\nTallgrass in North America.\nThe tallgrass prairie is a native ecosystem of the drainage basin of the Mississippi. Retreating glaciers dropped moraine material about 10,000 years ago. Wind-dropped loess and organic matter accumulated. This made the soil. The prairie had the deepest level of topsoil recorded anywhere. Animals such as buffalo, elk, deer, and rabbits lived there.\nThe animals added nitrogen to the soil with their urine and faeces. Prairie dogs dug tunnels that \"aerated the soil and channeled water several feet below the surface\".\nFor 5,000 to 8,000 years, more than of prairie grasslands were a major feature of the landscape. \nBetween 1800 and 1930, most of this natural environment was destroyed. Settlers transformed what they called \"the Great American Desert\" or \"The Inland Sea\" into farmland. They replaced the old grasses with new ones, mostly wheat and maize. They replaced the bison with cattle, another kind of bovine. About 40% of the world's maize grows in the United States, mostly on land that formerly grew grass. The grazing pattern of European cattle, the near-extermination of prairie dogs, and the plowing and cultivation of the land did the damage. Plowing cut tallgrass root systems and interrupted reproduction. Drainage changed the soil's water content, and soil erosion lost soil.\nEstimates differ of how much original tallgrass prairie survives. Perhaps less than 1% to 4%, mostly in \"scattered remnants found in pioneer cemeteries, restoration projects, along highways and railroad rights-of-way, and on steep bluffs high above rivers\". \nPlants and animals.\nIn many other parts of the world, the grasslands have little rain. or long dry periods. There are few trees because of the low rainfall. Thorny trees called acacias are one of a handful of trees that are able to grow in some African savannas. Wildfires are common and destroy trees. The animals also prevent trees from growing as they eat the tender sprouts before they can develop into grown trees. Elephants are known to tear down grown-up trees and feed on their leaves, making trees even more scarce.\nGrass can still grow because it survives the aridity and the trampling of the animals. This is why grasslands can feed vast numbers of animals. Animals include mice, rats that eat mostly seeds. Snakes, hawks and eagles eat mostly small animals. Big animals, mostly grazers, include zebras, ostriches, giraffes, rhinos, elephants, horses, and antelopes."}

The vehicles that carry freight or are called \"cars\" (in the United States) or \"wagons\" (in the United Kingdom). The ones that carry passengers are often called coaches or carriages. A place where a train stops to let people get on and off is called a train station or railway station. Early trains used horse power and ran on wooden or iron tracks. These were used in the Middle Ages. The first steam trains were built in England in the early 19th century. Long before railways, \"train\" meant any group of vehicles or pack animals traveling in a line, as in wagon train or camel train. \nThe first train (steam Railway Locomotive ) was invented by \"Richard Trevithick\" following an idea by Samual Homfray and aided by highly skilled WELSH craftsmenat at the Penydarren Iron Works in MERTHYR TYDFIL,WALES,UK.The train made it's first journey on 21st Feb.1804. \nThe first full-scale working railway steam locomotive, was the 3 ft (914 mm) gauge \"Coalbrookdale Locomotive\", built by Trevithick in 1802. \nTrains contain the prime mover (either locomotive or motor unit) and one or more cars. The locomotive or railway engine (usually the first car of the train) pulls the cars along the track. The last car you will see on a train is called the caboose. Some trains look like a special bus that can only drive on rails. Trains are used to carry people, as well as cargo, such as raw material,finished goods, and waste. \nTypes of train.\nFreight.\nFreight trains have freight cars (US) or goods wagons (UK) to carry goods from one place to another. Some are boxcars (closed and roofed cars for cargo); others are special so they can carry special cargo. There are hopper cars for sand, coal, ore and other granulous (sand-like) materials, flatbed cars for vehicles and machinery, tank cars for liquids, container cars for containers and even bottle cars for molten iron. Almost anything which is not too large to fit under tunnels and bridges can be transported on special freight cars.\nPassenger.\nPassenger trains have passenger cars (US) or coaches (UK) made so people can ride them from one train station to another. There are few long-distance passenger trains in the United States, but more in Europe and Asia. Most passenger cars are single-deckers: there are also double-decker passenger cars, such as the Finnish Inter-City cars.\nPassenger trains are usually a very comfortable way of traveling. Many trains have electrical outlets and Wi-Fi hotspots for computers, and a special restaurant car for dining and refreshments. There are also sleeping cars (passenger cars with beds) for long overnight voyages.\nHigh-speed rail uses special, fast passenger trains on special tracks. A few very fast ones are maglev trains using magnets to hover slightly off the tracks to have less friction.\nPropulsion.\nMost trains are pulled by locomotives. Before 1900, almost all were steam locomotives. As this kind of steam engine uses very much fuel for the work it does, steam began to give way to diesel locomotives and electric locomotives during the 1930s. Today, most locomotives are diesel-electric locomotives.\nSometimes a train has no separate locomotive, but the prime mover (diesel engine or electric motor) is located on the first car of the train itself, and the car has engineer's cabin. The car is called a \"motor unit\". Some trains have motors in many or all of the cars. This is called a diesel multiple unit or electric multiple unit. Usually, both ends of the train have engineer's cabins. These trains are especially popular in commuter traffic in large towns and cities. Electric trains get their power from a third rail or from overhead wires."}

It is a very small bay near Sorrento, Victoria. It is close to the entrance of Port Phillip Bay, south of the city of Melbourne.\nIn 1802, Governor Philip Gidley King in Sydney had written to Lord Hobart, Minister in charge of the colonies, in London, saying that Britain should start a settlement at Port Phillip Bay. King thought it would be good area for fishing and sealing. He was also worried that the French might settle in the area and then would control Bass Strait. Lieutenant John Murray had explored Port Phillip Bay in 1802 and thought that the Sorrento area would be a good spot to start a settlement.\nLeaving England.\nLieutenant Governor David Collins was put in charge of starting the new settlement. He took 307 convicts, some with wives and children, 51 soldiers, 17 free settlers, some with wives and children, and a government staff of 12, and a clergyman, the Reverend Knopwood. The group of more than 400 people left England in April 1803, in the store ship \u201cOcean\u201d and the convict ship \u201cCalcutta.\u201d\nThe two ships sailed to Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Capetown in South Africa, and arrived at Port Phillip Bay on 6 October and 8 October 1803. Only 14 people died on the trip. Collins was unable to find a good place to land that had drinking water and good soil. On 13 October 1803, he landed at Sullivan\u2019s Bay, which he named after the Under Secretary of the Colonial War Department.\nSettlement.\nThe new settlers were able to get water by putting wooden barrels into the sand, and letting the water in the ground soak into them. It was salty and not nice to drink. The soil was very sandy and not suitable for farming. There were very few trees suitable for cutting up into building timber. The sandy ground meant that heavy items could not be carried in a wagon, which would be stuck in the sand, but had to be dragged instead. The small entrance to the bay made it difficult for sailing ships to get in or out safely. The tools brought from England, such a spades, hoes and axes, were very badly made and broke easily. Coscape. He had hoped to increase the food supply with fresh fish and kangaroos, but they were not able to catch any.\nLife at Sullivan\u2019s Bay.\nMale convicts were given a set of clothes in October 1803 which included:\nThe food ration each week was:\nWomen were to be given 2/3 of that amount, children half the amount, and small children under 5 years, \u00bc of the ration.\nA convict printer, Robert Walsh printed the orders and instructions for the settlement on a small printing press. During the time of the settlement 43 such orders were printed.\nCollins told the convicts not to go into the water to wash because of the danger from hungry sharks and stingrays. Some tried to escape by walking overland to Sydney. They soon gave up and went back to the settlement. Settler, John Skilton, died on 17 October 1803. On 25 November 1803, the first child, William James Hobart Thorne, was born to a soldier, Sergeant Thorne and his wife. One child of convict parents was John Pascoe Fawkner, who returned to start the settlement of Melbourne in 1835.\nAbandoned.\nIn November, Collins sent the \u201cOcean\u201d to Sydney with a letter asking King to let him abandon the settlement, and move it to either Port Dalrymple or the Derwent River in Van Diemen's Land. The \u201cOcean\u201d came back in December and Collins wasted no time in getting most of the convicts and settlers packed up. He gave an order that convicts had to work on Sundays to make sure the group was ready to leave as soon as possible. On 30 January 1804, the \u201cOcean\u201d set sail for the Derwent River. Lieutenant William Sladden was left behind in charge of a small group. The \u201cOcean\u201d returned and on 20 May 1804, the settlement was abandoned.\nThree people were left behind after the settlement was abandoned, two were escaped convicts and one was a runaway soldier, William Buckley. When John Batman came to settle in Victoria 30 years later, he found Buckley living with an aboriginal tribe. The only sign of the settlement now is four graves at Sullivan Bay, and the remains of a water barrel in the Latrobe Library collection."}

It was adopted by the Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria on 2 March 2005. An early explanation of the Streamlined System was made in 1997 to the US and UK Antartcic place-naming authorities. They had noticed the difference from their 1952 BGN/PCGN romanization of Bulgarian. The new system became subject to comparative study at the Department of English and American Studies at Sofia University.\nSubsequently, the system was chosen by the Bulgarian Government. It is the official transliteration system to be used in all identity documents, road signs, street names, official information systems, databases, local authorities\u2019 websites etc. Eventually, the Streamlined System became part of Bulgarian law by way of the passed in 2009.\nThe Streamlined system was adopted also by UN in 2012, and for official US and UK use, by BGN and PCGN in 2013. Ivanov proposes using his Romanization approach in the case of Cyrillic alphabets of other Slavic languages, notably Russian.\nBasic principles.\nThe Streamlined System was designed with the aim of striking an optimal balance between the following partly overlapping and partly conflicting priorities:\nExceptions: \nIt had been proposed to modify the Streamlined System so that Bulgarian letters \u042a and \u0426 were transliterated as \"\u0102\" and \"TZ\" respectively. However, those proposals failed to gain wider acceptance, and were not adopted for official usage.\nInvertibility.\nThe system is not invertible, for \u0410, \u0416, \u0419, \u0426, \u0428, \u0429, \u042e, \u042f are transliterated in the same way as are \u042a, \u0417\u0425, \u042c, \u0422\u0421, \u0421\u0425, \u0428\u0422, \u0419\u0423, \u0419\u0410 respectively. An auxiliary, invertible variant of the system without the \u0418\u042f-exception rule is proposed by L. Ivanov, D. Skordev and D. Dobrev to be used in those special cases when the exact retrieval of Bulgarian words from their Romanized forms is a priority, with Cyrillic letters and combinations of letters \n\u042a, \u042c, \u0417\u0425, \u0419\u0410, \u0419\u0423, \u0421\u0425, \u0422\u0421, \u0422\u0428, \u0422\u0429, \u0428\u0422, \u0428\u0426 transliterated as \"`A\", \"`Y\", \"Z|H\", \"Y|A\", \"Y|U\", \"S|H\", \"T|S\", \"T|SH\", \"T|SHT\", \"SH|T\", \"SH|TS\" respectively. In order to ensure full invertibility of the system, including the case of the \u0418\u042f-exception rule, one may transliterate word-final -\u0418\u0410 as \"I|A\" rather than \"IA\". The plain streamlined transliteration word form could be retrieved from its invertible variant by simply removing the additional symbols ` and |.\nComparison with other systems.\nThe Streamlined System is based on an English-oriented transliteration, taking advantage of the global \"lingua franca\" role of English. A similar shift towards English-oriented transliteration is observed in the case of other Cyrillic alphabets such as Russian and Ukrainian, and to some extent Macedonian.\nThe Streamlined System is similar to the old 1952 BGN/PCGN System for the Romanization of Bulgarian, which had been official in the USA and the United Kingdom until 2013. The latter however transliterates the Cyrillic letters \u0425, \u042c and \u042a as \"KH\", \"\u2019\" (apostrophe) and \"\u016c\", while the former uses \"H\", \"Y\" and \"A\" instead.\nAnother similar system not adopted for official use in Bulgaria is that of A. Danchev, M. Holman, E. Dimova and M. Savova, which transliterates the Cyrillic letters \u0423 and \u042a by \"OU\" and \"U\" respectively, while the Streamlined System uses \"U\" and \"A\" for this purpose. Furthermore, the latter system transliterates the digraphs \u0410\u0419\u2022\u0430\u0439, \u0415\u0419\u2022\u0435\u0439, \u041e\u0419\u2022\u043e\u0439 and \u0423\u0419\u2022\u0443\u0439 by AI\u2022ai, EI\u2022ei, OI\u2022oi and OUI\u2022oui instead of AY\u2022ay, EY\u2022ey, OY\u2022oy and UY\u2022uy respectively."}

It was established after an 1897 memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Mortimer Durand of British India and Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. Referred to as a frontier line, it is named after Mortimer Durand, who was the Foreign Secretary of colonial British India at the time. Later, Abdur Rahman Khan's successor, Amir Habibullah Khan signed a new agreement with Britain which again confirmed the legality of the Durand Line. King Amanullah Khan also accepted Durand line as international border between Afghanistan and British India after signing the Anglo-Afghan treaty of 1919. Article 5 of this treaty, on the basis of which Afghanistan reclaimed its independence, says that Afghanistan accepted all previously agreed border arrangements with British India. Hence, Afghanistan as an independent country recognized Durand line as an international border.\nThe Durand Line cuts through the Afghan tribal areas, politically dividing ethnic Pashtuns and Baloch people who live on both sides. The line is internationally recognized by many countries as the western border of Pakistan, but Afghan governments after 1947 never recognized it.\nAfghan Pashtun leaders claim Pakistani territories and say that the Durand Line is \"an issue of historical importance for Afghanistan. The Afghan people, not the government, can take a final decision on it.\" However, non-Pashtuns Afghans have always recognized durand line as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Unsafe abortions can be very dangerous to the mother. Many women die or get a disease because they had an unsafe abortion. About 95 percent of unsafe abortions happen in developing countries.\nMethod.\nTwo very common ways that unsafe abortions are done are:\nBack-alley abortion.\nA back-alley abortion (Back-Yard Abortion in Australia) is the common slang term for an illegal abortion in the English-speaking world. \nThe method using the coat hanger, as described above, was known by many people. This method was not what was done normally, though. In fact, Mary Calderone, former medical director of Planned Parenthood, said, in a 1960 printing of the \"American Journal of Public Health\":\nHerbal abortions (when done illegally) can also be described as back-alley abortions because they are not induced in a medical facility.\nControversy.\nThe argument of back-alley abortions was used to help make abortion legal in the United States. In 1973, the US Supreme Court decided that abortion should be legalized. It was treating a case called Roe v. Wade. Since then, it has become a central argument on the part of some prominent legal abortion advocates. Gerri Santoro died of blood loss after a back-alley abortion. Her photo was used extensively to illustrate the dangers of illegal abortions.\nBernard Nathanson performed many abortions but later was against them. He has said that many of the statistics that show that many women died from back-alley abortions in the US are false. He said that he and his colleagues made many such statistics to lead people to believe that legalizing abortion was a good thing to do. \nHow many unsafe abortions there are by continent.\nSource: Unsafe Abortion: Mortality and Risk Estimates of Death data from WHO press, Geneva, 1997\n10,000 women a year die from unsafe abortions in Nigeria."}

In 2001 there were only 56 known plants. The plants were first collected in 1888, and they were then thought to have become extinct. The Zieria was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\nWhat the plant looks like.\nIt is a small shrub, which is related to the boronia plants. It is about tall and 50 cm wide, though some plants have grown up to tall. It has a small white or pink flower with four petals, about long. The plant has flowers in spring, from August to October. It also has small green leaves which are trifoliate, as being in three parts like a clover leaf. The leaves have a strong smell.\nWhere they grow.\nThe plants have only been found near the Araluen Creek. They are growing on a steep, rocky, hillside.\nEndangered.\nThe plant has been listed as Endangered under the Australian Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also listed by the New South Wales Government, Endangered (Schedule 1, Part 1) on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. It is endangered because there are so few of the plants and they are only found in one place. A bushfire could destroy all the plants. There is also a danger from wild goats in the area. The goats do not eat the Zieria, but they could walk on the new seedlings and crush them. The goats might eat all the other plants which could lead to erosion and the soil could be washed away. Weeds growing around the plants might also stop new Zierias from growing.\nSaving the plant.\nThere is now a plan to protect the plant. These plans include:"}

He was the first person to describe in mathematical terms how three planets in orbit affect each others paths as they pass near by one another. This was called the Three Body Problem. He also tried to understand why the speed of light seems to be the fastest speed at which anything can travel in the universe. In some ways he beat the famous scientist Albert Einstein to solving this question, but Einstein gave a more complete answer. He gained fame for the discovery of the theory of relativity instead of Poincar\u00e9.\nHe created the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, one of the most famous problems in mathematics which was only solved 100 years later. He began the branches of mathematics which are known today as chaos theory and topology.\nHe also wrote about science in a simple way that ordinary people could understand."}

Skydiving can be an exciting sport.\nSkydiving includes free falling (usually from an aeroplane) through the air prior to opening a parachute. Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time. Longer free fall times can be achieved by exiting an aircraft at altitudes much higher than 4,000m, but very high jumps require pressurized oxygen within the aircraft, and bottled oxygen for the diver. \nDuring a skydive, total freedom and control of the air can be enjoyed as well as many complex and spectacular manoeuvres including flat turns, somersaults and formation skydiving. Skydiving can be enjoyed either as an individual - doing solo(alone) jumps - or as part of a team carrying out formation skydiving. Generally, the term \u2018skydive\u2019 refers to the time spent in freefall from exiting an aircraft to deploying a parachute but skydiving does include some disciplines such as accuracy landings and canopy formation flying which concentrate on the time spent once a canopy has been deployed."}

This term became common during the financial crisis that began in August 2007. Toxic assets played a major role in that crisis. When the market for such assets ceases to function, it is described as \"frozen\". \nToxic assets were originally called troubled assets. It took the financial crisis of 2008 to produce a more vivid term. That was when it became clear that some of the biggest U.S. financial institutions were sitting on a vast quantity of worthless assets. In fact, they were losing value at a pace that many had not thought was possible. \nMarkets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew significantly worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic-asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other, major financial-institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to significantly reduce their stated assets, making them appear insolvent."}

To be more specific, this high protein snack is from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia. The word Biltong comes from the Dutch word \u2018bil\u2019 and \u2018tong\u2019 which respectively holds the meaning of \u2018buttock\u201d and \u201cstrip\u201d or \u201ctongue\u201d. Biltong can be made of a variety of meats, though beef biltong is the most common one in modern times. Strip-cut beef fillets that are flat with muscle grains are used to make biltong. Due to this, biltong is usually slightly chewy. Biltong has traditionally been made of game meats such as kudu, springbok and wildebeest. You may also find biltong made of chicken, fish and ostrich meat.\nHistory.\nBiltong has actually been around for centuries with its roots tracing back to South Africa. In a time before refrigerators and freezers, indigenous people needed a way to preserve extra meat for future meals. To do this, they used the basic resources at hand \u2014 knives to cut the meat, salt to flavor and preserve, and tree branches to hang the meat until it was dry.\nThe 17th century European settlers who arrived later saw the benefits of having a stock supply of food. They quickly adopted this method, adding their own ingredients of vinegar and saltpeter (potassium nitrate) to the meat-curing mix.\nThen, in the 19th century, came the Dutch. In a mass migration known as the , thousands of Dutch farmers hitched their wagons to avoid British rule in Cape Colony and moved into the inland of Southern Africa.\nFor this long journey, they needed food \u2014 something portable, something non-perishable, and something with sustenance. Biltong was their perfect solution.\nThey toted the preserved meat with them as they traveled, calling it \u201cbiltong\u201d\u2014 a combination of the Dutch words \u201cbille\u201d (for buttock) and \u201ctonghe\u201d (for strip or tongue).\nThis marked the beginnings of biltong, now one of South Africa\u2019s favorite meaty snacks."}

These are the four-dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids (in three dimensions) and the regular polygons (in two dimensions).\nThese polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli in the mid-19th century. Schl\u00e4fli discovered that there are precisely six such figures. Five of these may be thought of as higher dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids. There is one additional figure (the 24-cell) which has no three-dimensional equivalent.\nEach convex regular 4-polytope is bounded by a set of 3-dimensional \"cells\" which are all Platonic solids of the same type and size. These are fitted together along their respective faces in a regular fashion.\nProperties.\nThe following tables lists some properties of the six convex regular polychora. The symmetry groups of these polychora are all Coxeter groups and given in the notation described in that article. The number following the name of the group is the order of the group.\nSince the boundaries of each of these figures is topologically equivalent to a 3-sphere, whose Euler characteristic is zero, we have the 4-dimensional analog of Euler's polyhedral formula:\nwhere \"N\"\"k\" denotes the number of \"k\"-faces in the polytope (a vertex is a 0-face, an edge is a 1-face, etc.).\nVisualizations.\nThe following table shows some 2 dimensional projections of these polytopes.

It is also known as the hexadecachoron. It is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli in the mid-19th century. \nConway calls it an orthoplex for \"orthant complex\", as well as the entire class of cross-polytopes.\nGeometry.\nThe hexadecachoron is a member of the family of polytopes called the cross-polytopes, which exist in all dimensions. As such, its dual polychoron is the tesseract (the 4-dimensional hypercube).\nIt is bounded by 16 cells, all of which are regular tetrahedra. It has 32 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices. The 24 edges bound 6 squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes.\nThe eight vertices of the hexadecachoron are (\u00b11, 0, 0, 0), (0, \u00b11, 0, 0), (0, 0, \u00b11, 0), (0, 0, 0, \u00b11). All vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs.\nThe Schl\u00e4fli symbol of the hexadecachoron is {3,3,4}. Its vertex figure is a regular octahedron. There are 8 tetrahedra, 12 triangles, and 6 edges meeting at every vertex. Its edge figure is a square. There are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge.\nThere is a lower symmetry form of the \"16-cell\", called a demitesseract or 4-demicube, a member of the demihypercube family, and represented by h{4,3,3}, and can be drawn bicolored with alternating tetrahedral cells.\nTessellations.\nOne can tessellate 4-dimensional Euclidean space by regular 16-cells. This is called the hexadecachoric honeycomb and has Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3,3,4,3}. The dual tessellation, icositetrachoric honeycomb, {3,4,3,3}, is made of by regular 24-cells. Together with the tesseractic honeycomb {4,3,3,4}, these are the only three regular tessellations of R4. Each 16-cell has 16 neighbors with which it shares an octahedron, 24 neighbors with which it shares only an edge, and 72 neighbors with which it shares only a single point. Twenty-four 16-cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation.\nProjections.\nThe cell-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a cubical envelope. The closest and farthest cells are projected to inscribed tetrahedra within the cube, corresponding with the two possible ways to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube. Surrounding each of these tetrahedra are 4 other (non-regular) tetrahedral volumes that are the images of the 4 surrounding tetrahedral cells, filling up the space between the inscribed tetrahedron and the cube. The remaining 6 cells are projected onto the square faces of the cube. In this projection of the 16-cell, all its edges lie on the faces of the cubical envelope.\nThe cell-first perspective projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a triakis tetrahedral envelope. The layout of the cells within this envelope are analogous to that of the cell-first parallel projection.\nThe vertex-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has an octahedral envelope. This octahedron can be divided into 8 tetrahedral volumes, by cutting along the coordinate planes. Each of these volumes is the image of a pair of cells in the 16-cell. The closest vertex of the 16-cell to the viewer projects onto the center of the octahedron.\nFinally the edge-first parallel projection has a shortened octahedral envelope, and the face-first parallel projection has a hexagonal bipyramidal envelope."}

The ticket is issued by Transport for London and National Rail and can be used on the services of either.\nHistory.\nBefore Travelcards were used, travellers in Greater London had to pay every time they changed between\nLondon Transport's bus and Underground services. This was a problem as it led to delays while purchasing the next ticket.\nOne ticket for all transport in London was one of the key promises made in 1981 by the newly-elected Labour Greater London Council, headed by council leader Ken Livingstone. The policy, with the slogan \"Just The Ticket\", meant that only one ticket was needed for London Transport bus and Underground services. They also reduced the price of transport. The price cut was then ruled illegal, but the one pricing scheme was mostly a success and was extended during the 1980s and 1990s as new transport routes were opened in London.\nBy 1985, there were two travelcards: the Travelcard itself, which covered only London Buses and the Underground, and the Capitalcard, which covered most bus, Underground and local British Rail (BR) services. The Travelcard replaced the original Capitalcard, while including its greater availability, around 1989.\nThe original \"zonal\" system was mainly in Greater London. The zone areas used both letters and numbers for the outermost zones such that bus availability ignored the letter while BR and Underground availability depended also upon the letter(s) - e.g. a Travelcard or Capitalcard valid in zone 3a (but not 3b or 3c) was valid on buses in zones 3a, 3b and 3c but only in zone 3a when used on the railway services.\nTransport modes.\nA Travelcard entitles the holder to use the following modes of transport within Greater London:\nTravelcards also entitle the holder to a 33% discount on some London River Services."}

It was owned by a ship line called the Italian Line. It was said to be the biggest, fastest, safest, and most beautiful ship in Italy after World War II. It could carry 1,221 passengers and 563 crew.\nThe ship was built by the Ansaldo Shipyards in Genoa, Italy. It was launched on June 16, 1951. Its maiden voyage, or first voyage, was on January 14, 1953. Three years later in 1956, it crashed with another ship, MS \"Stockholm\", in the Atlantic Ocean. At that time, 1,134 passengers and 572 crew were on board. \"Andrea Doria\" sank in 11 hours, but \"Stockholm\" survived.\nThe \"Andrea Doria\" was the last large ocean liner to sink before airplane travel became popular.\nEarly history.\n\"Andrea Doria\" was built at the Ansaldo Shipyards, which was a shipbuilding company in Genoa, Italy. At the time of building, she was:\nIt was designed for comfort. Its designer was an Italian architect called Minoletti. There was also another ship, \"Cristoforo Colombo\", that looked exactly like \"Andrea Doria\".\n\"Andrea Doria\" was a transatlantic ocean liner, which is a ship that crosses the Atlantic Ocean. The ship had three swimming pools, and was the first ship to have that many. Over 1 million dollars were spent on art to decorate the ship.\nThe ship was also built for safety. It had 11 watertight compartments. These are special dividers in a ship to keep water in one place. If two of them were filled, the ship would not sink. \"Andrea Doria\" also had very advanced radar. Radar could warn the captain of the Andrea Doria if there was something in the path of the ship. However one big problem was that the ship often tilted too much to one side.\n\"Andrea Doria\" had two rows of lifeboats, which are small boats that can evacuate passengers if the ship sinks. However, if the ship tilted too much, half of the lifeboats could not be used. \"Andrea Doria\"'s maiden voyage (first voyage) was on January 14, 1953.\nBefore the collision.\n\"Andrea Doria\" sank in the night between July 25, 1956, and July 26, 1956. When she sank, she had 1,134 passengers and 572 crew members, and her captain was Piero Calamai. She was sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. Her path was from Genoa, Italy, to New York, in the United States. \"Andrea Doria\" entered very thick fog when it passed by Nantucket, which is a small island near Massachusetts. Soon, another ship entered the fog. This was SS \"Stockholm\". SS \"Stockholm\" was another passenger ship. Because of the fog, the two ships could not see each other. When they finally noticed each other, they tried to turn away. \"Andrea Doria\" turned left to pass \"Stockholm\". But \"Stockholm\" turned right to try to pass \"Andrea Doria\". Because of the fog, they could not see what each other was trying to do. At 11:10 PM of July 25, 1956, \"Andrea Doria\" and \"Stockholm\" crashed together.\nSinking.\n\"Stockholm\" crashed into the right side of \"Andrea Doria\" near the middle. It made a large hole that was almost deep. It broke open several of the watertight compartments on \"Andrea Doria\". It also broke five fuel tanks. The fuel tanks were filled by 500 tons of water. \"Stockholm\" and \"Andrea Doria\" separated in 30 seconds. \"Andrea Doria\" began to tilt to its right side. Soon, half of the lifeboats could not be used, because it was tilting too much. The weight of the fuel tanks that were filled by water also pulled it down. \"Stockholm\"'s whole front end was destroyed, but it did not sink. 46 passengers on the \"Andrea Doria\" were killed by the crash. Five crew members of the \"Stockholm\" were also killed. However, one incredible survivor was Linda Morgan, an \"Andrea Doria\" passenger who landed on the \"Stockholm\" when they crashed.\nThirty minutes after the crash, the people on \"Andrea Doria\" decided to abandon the ship. However, some crew had already left. This made it harder because no crew was there to help. However, there were still enough lifeboats to get everyone out safely. The \"SS \"Ile de France\"\", a French ship, arrived at the \"Andrea Doria\" to help rescue passengers. It launched lifeboats to rescue passengers of the \"Andrea Doria\". The \"Ile de France\" had sailed only one day, so it had lots of supplies left to help the passengers of \"Andrea Doria\". \"Andrea Doria\" continued to tilt right, and eventually began to sink on 9:45 AM of July 26, 1956. Before that, at 9:00 AM, all the survivors were off the ship. At 10:00 AM, \"Andrea Doria\" was tilted so far to the right that its windows touched the ocean. At 10:09 AM, the ship sank. This was 10 hours and 59 minutes after it had crashed with the \"Stockholm\". The back of \"Andrea Doria\" rose, and its left propeller lifted out of the water. Some lifeboats that were still on the ship broke off and floated away upside down. The ship had drifted 1.6 nautical miles (a measuring distance used at sea) from where it had crashed with the \"Stockholm\".\nA total of six different ships rescued passengers of the \"Andrea Doria\", including the \"Stockholm\" and \"Ile de France\". \"Stockholm\" was the last to arrive, because it was damaged. Many families had their hopes of seeing loved ones again destroyed. The most affected were those who were meeting members of several families immigrating to the United States in hope of new lives. The Chrysler Norseman, a prototype car headed to New York, was also lost with the other cars aboard \"Andrea Doria\". A \"Rolls-Royce\" luxury car was also on Andrea Doria.\nCauses of the sinking.\nA series of lawsuits were filed by both ship lines in response to the disaster. The reasons argued included:\nDiving.\n\"Andrea Doria\" landed on the ocean bottom sideways, with her left side facing up, in good condition. At first, the top of the shipwreck was in water about deep. It was a popular destination for divers. However, the \"Andrea Doria\" has become a difficult ship to explore. The wreck is at .\nMore recently, the top part of the ship has collapsed. Inside the ship, many supports have broken. The ship is slowly getting shorter as its weight presses downwards. The top of the wreck is now below the water. Fifteen people have died exploring the \"Andrea Doria\".\nResult.\nThe front of \"Stockholm\" was eventually fixed. About $1 million was spent. Now, \"Stockholm\" is named \"Athena\", and still sails.\nSeveral books have been published about \"Andrea Doria\". This is a list of some of them:\nA memorial wreath was put at the place where \"Andrea Doria\" sank in July 2002."}

He was the leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Deng never held office as the head of state or the head of government, but was the \"de facto\" leader of the People's Republic of China from 1978 to the early 1990s. Deng has often been described as practical due to his open market policies after the death of Mao, whilst not deviating much from the original socialist elements of the People's Republic of China.\nDeng was born in Guang'an, Sichuan. He died of an infection and of Parkinson's disease in Beijing, aged 92.\nEarly life and family.\nDeng's father, Deng Wenming, was a middle-level landowner. He had studied at the University of Law and Political Science in Chengdu. His mother, named Dan, died early in Deng's life. Deng had three brothers and three sisters.\nDeng's first wife was one of his schoolmates from Moscow. She died at the age of 24 a few days after giving birth to Deng's first child, which was a baby girl. This daughter also died. His second wife was Jin Weiying. Jin left him after Deng was attacked in politics 1933. His third wife Zhuo Lin was the daughter of an industrialist in Yunnan Province. She became a member of the Communist Party in 1938. She and Deng married in 1939 in front of Mao's cave home in Yan'an. They had five children: three daughters (Deng Lin, Deng Nan and Deng Rong) and two sons (Deng Pufang and Deng Zhifang).\nEducation and early career.\nIn the summer of 1919, Deng Xiaoping graduated from the Chongqing School. He and 80 schoolmates travelled by ship to France. They were part of a work-study program. About 4,000 Chinese did this program by 1927. Deng was the youngest of all the Chinese students in the group. He was 15 years old. Deng's father strongly supported his son's doing the work-study abroad program. Deng told his father he wanted \"to learn knowledge and truth from the West in order to save China.\" Deng knew that China was suffering. He thought Chinese people must have a modern education to save their country.\nIn France Deng met many future Chinese leaders: Zhou Enlai, Nie Rongzhen, Cai Hesen, Zhao Shiyan and Li Wenhai. These older Chinese students helped Deng study Marxism. In 1921 he joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in Europe. In 1924, he joined the Chinese Communist Party. He became one of the leaders of the Youth League in Europe. In 1926 Deng traveled to the Soviet Union and studied at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. One of his classmates was Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek.\nReturn to China.\nIn March 1927, Deng arrived in Xi'an, northwest China from Moscow. He joined the army of Feng Yuxiang. Feng had asked the Soviet Union for help. But at that time, the Soviet Union supported the Communists' alliance with the Nationalists of the Kuomintang (KMT). In 1929 Deng led the Baise Uprising in Guangxi province against the Kuomintang (KMT) government. The uprising failed, and Deng went to the Central Soviet Area in Jiangxi province.\nPolitical career.\nDeng went on the Long March with Mao. During the Japanese Occupation of China, he joined the Eighth Route Army commanded by Liu Bocheng. After World War II he was part of peace talks between the Communists and the Kuomintang. These talks failed. On 1 October 1949, Deng was at proclamation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. Deng became mayor of Chongqing and stayed there until 1952. From 1952 until the early 1960s Deng had many powerful positions in government in Beijing. But, he became the target of two political purges: the Cultural Revolution and the Criticize Deng campaign in 1976. Deng said that the Cultural Revolution had been bad for China in 1977 and started the \"Beijing Spring.\" China started to open more in 1978-79. Deng worked to reform the Chinese economy and increase exports during the 1980s. The Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 weakened him. He retired from politics in 1992."}

The Nasrid sultans and kings paid tribute to the Christian kings and cooperated with them in the battle against rebellious Muslims under Castilian rule.\nOn January 2, 1492, the last Muslim leader, Muhammad XII, surrendered complete control of Granada, to Ferdinand and Isabella, after the city was besieged in the Battle of Granada."}

Sylvester Stallone has been in many action movies. He has played two famous movie characters: Rocky Balboa, the boxer who overcame challenges to fight for love and glory, and John Rambo, a brave soldier who did violent missions.\nEarly life.\nSylvester Gardenzio Stallone was born on July 6, 1946 in New York City, and he is the son of Frank Stallone Sr. (1919 \u2013 2011), a hairdresser, and Jackie Stallone (1921 \u2013 2020), an astrologer, former dancer, and supporter of wrestling for women. During his birth, doctors used , an instrument that looks like a pair of pincers or tongs, that damaged a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of Stallone's face. The paralysis caused his well known speech and drooping lower lip.\nStallone's grandfather, Silvestro Staglione, was an immigrant from Gioia del Colle, in the province of Bari (Apulia, Italy). Stallone's mother was born in Washington, D.C., and she was the daughter of a Parisian socialite. When Stallone was between the ages of two and five he boarded in Queens, and he only saw his parents on the weekends. In 1951 he went back to live with his parents in Maryland where they owned beauty salons. In 1960s he attended Abraham Lincoln High School (living in the Tacony section of Philadelphia which inspired the Rocky stories) after being rejected for the Catholic High School Father Judge and after that he went to beauty school.\nIn the 1960s, Stallone stopped going to beauty school after he won a scholarship for the American College of Switzerland in Leysin. There, he studied drama and was well received in school productions. When he went back to America he went to the Theater Arts Department at University of Miami Florida for three years. He came within a few credit hours of graduation before he decided to drop out and try a career at writing screenplays under the pen names Q. Moonblood and J.J. Deadlock. At the same time he started acting in small parts in movies.\nLater, Stallone asked that his acting and life experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining credits, and the President of the University of Miami gave him a Bachelors of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in 1999.\nCareer.\n\"Italian Stallion\" and \"Score\".\nStallone had his first role in the softcore pornography movie \"Party at Kitty and Stud's\" (1970), which was later re-released as \"Italian Stallion\". He was paid US$200 for two days work. An \"uncut\" version of the movie was released in 2007, and it claimed to show actual hardcore footage of Stallone. However, trade journal \"AVN\", said that Stallone was not in the hardcore scenes. In 2008, a DVD was released of \"White Fire\" (1976), a dubbed, German edit of 'Party at Kitty and Stud's', which was alleged to include hardcore footage of Stallone.\nStallone also starred in the play called \"Score\" which had 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 - November 15, 1971. It was later made into a movie by Radley Metzger.\nEarly movie roles, 1971\u20131975.\nStallone's other first few movie roles were small, and he did brief appearances that he did not get credit for in Woody Allen's \"Bananas\" (1971) as a subway thug, in the thriller \"Klute\" (1971) as an extra dancing in a club, and with Jack Lemmon in\"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\" (1975), as a young person. In the Lemmon movie, Jack Lemmon chases, tackles and Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a thief. He also starred in the hit \"The Lords of Flatbush\" (1974). In 1975, he played supporting roles in \"Farewell, My Lovely\", \"Capone\" and, another hit, \"Death Race 2000\". He also made guest appearances on the TV series \"Police Story\" and \"Kojak\".\nSuccess with \"Rocky\", 1976.\nStallone was not very well known by a lot of people until his role in \"Rocky\" (1976). On March 24, 1975, he saw the Muhammed Ali\u2013Chuck Wepner fight which gave him the idea for \"Rocky\". That night Stallone went home, and in three days he had written the script for \"Rocky\". After that, he tried to sell the script with the intent of playing the lead role. Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler both liked the script (which Stallone submitted to them after a casting), and planned on having a star like Burt Reynolds or James Caan to play the lead character. \"Rocky\" was nominated for ten Academy Awards, this included Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone.\nRocky, Rambo and new movie roles, 1978\u20131989.\nThe second movie \"Rocky II\" which Stallone had also written and directed was released in 1979 and also became a huge success. The money it made was over US$200 million.\nApart from the \"Rocky\" movies, Stallone did many other movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s which were critically acclaimed but were not successful at the box office. He received critical praise for movies such as \"F.I.S.T.\" (1978), a social, narrative styled drama where he plays a warehouse worker who becomes involved in the labor union leadership. In \"Paradise Alley\" (1978), he plays one of three brothers who is a con artist and who helps his other brother who is involved in wrestling.\nIn the early 1980s, he starred in a movie with the British veteran Michael Caine in \"Escape to Victory\" (1981), a sports drama where he plays a prisoner of war involved in a Nazi propaganda fu\u00dfball (soccer) tournament. Stallone then created the action thriller movie \"Nighthawks\" (1981), in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat and mouse game with a foreign terrorist.\nStallone had another major success when he played as a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo in the action adventure movie \"First Blood\" (1982). The first chapter of Rambo was both a critical and box office success. The critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human despite the way he is described in the book of the same name, \"First Blood\" and in the other movies. Two other Rambo movies \"\" (1985) and \"Rambo III\" (1988) followed (and another, Rambo, in 2008). Although box office hits, the movies were given much less critical praise than the original. He also continued his box office success with the \"Rocky\" franchise and wrote, directed and starred in two more movies to the series: \"Rocky III\" (1982) and \"Rocky IV\" (1985). \nStallone also unsuccessfully attempted roles in different genres. He wrote and starred in the comedy movie \"Rhinestone\" (1984) where he played a wannabe country music singer and the drama movie \"Over the Top\" (1987) where he played a truck driver who enters an arm wrestling competition to impress his estranged son. For the Rhinestone soundtrack, he performed a song. These movies did not do well at the box office and were not well received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 James Cagney classic Angels With Dirty Faces. The movie would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Pictures and he was to co-star with Christopher Reeve. It was going to be directed by Menahem Golan. The re-making of such a very much liked classic was given disapproval by Variety Magazine and horror by top critic Roger Ebert. So, Cannon decided to make Cobra instead. \"Cobra\" (1986) and \"Tango and Cash\" (1989) did solid business domestically but overseas they did blockbuster business making over $100 million in foreign markets and over $160 million worldwide. The Rocky and Rambo franchises at the end of the decade were billion dollar franchises internationally.\n1990\u20132002.\nWith the recent success of \"Lock Up\" and \"Tango &amp; Cash\", at the start of the 1990s Stallone starred in the fifth installment of the Rocky series \"Rocky V\" which was considered a box office disappointment and was also disliked by fans because it seemed like an unnecessary movie to the series. It was supposed to have been the last installment in the franchise at the time.\nAfter starring in poorly received \"Oscar\" (1991) and \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\" (1992) during the early 90s, he made a big comeback in 1993 with the movie \"Cliffhanger\" which became an really successful movie making over US$255 million worldwide. Later that year he enjoyed another hit with the futuristic action movie \"Demolition Man\" which made over $158 million worldwide. His come back success continued with 1994's \"The Specialist\" (over $170 million worldwide). \nIn 1995, he played the comic book based character Judge Dredd who was taken from the well known British comic book 2000 AD in the movie of the same name. The money he made from foregin countries saved the domestic box office disappointment of \"Judge Dredd\" with a worldwide tally of $113 million. He also appeared in the thriller \"Assassins\" (1995) with the other stars Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. In 1996, he starred in the disaster movie \"Daylight\" which made only $33 million in the U.S but was a major hit overseas making $126 million, totaling $159,212,469 worldwide.\nThat same year Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the Trey Parker and Matt Stone short comedy movie \"Your Studio and You\" commissioned by the Seagram Company for a party celebrating their earning of Universal Studios and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he was saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a wine cooler and calls him a \"brainiac\". In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Fucking cheap studio!\"\nFollowing his amazing performance in \"Rocky\", critic Roger Ebert had once said Stallone could become the next Marlon Brando, although he never received the same critical praise achieved with \"Rocky\". Stallone did, however, go on to receive much approval for his role in the crime drama \"Cop Land\" (1997) in which he starred alongside Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. The movie was only a small success at the box office. His performance led him to win the Stockholm International movie Festival Best Actor Award. In 1998 he did voice-over work for the computer-animated movie \"Antz,\" which made over $90 million domestically.\nStallone starred in the thriller \"Get Carter\" \u2014 a remake of the 1971 British Michael Caine movie of the same name\u2014but the movie was not very well received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined a lot after the movies \"Driven\" (2001), \"Avenging Angelo\" (2002) and \"D-Tox\" (2002). \nIn 2000, Stallone received a \"Worst Actor of the Century\" Razzie award, citing \"95% of Everything He's Ever Done\" rather than one movie. By 2000, Stallone had been awarded four Worst Actor Razzie awards for individual movies. These include a \"Worst Screen Couple\" Razzie, and a \"Worst Actor of the Decade\" Razzie for the 1980s. He had been nominated for the Worst Actor award for nine different years from 1984 to 1992.\n2003\u20132005.\nIn 2003, he played as a villain in the third movie of the Spy Kids trilogy \"\" which was a huge box office success (almost $200 million worldwide). Stallone also had a small appearance in the 2003 French movie \"Taxi 3\" as a passenger.\nFollowing several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain fame for his role in the crime drama \"Shade\" (2003) which was a box office failure but was praised by critics. He was also supposed to star and direct a movie about the murder of rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, entitled \"Notorious\", but the movie was not made due to legal issues presented by the 2009 movie of the same name.\nIn 2005, he was the co-presenter alongside Sugar Ray Leonard of the NBC Reality television boxing series \"The Contender\". That same year he also made a guest appearance in two episodes of the television series \"Las Vegas\". In 2005, Stallone also inducted wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, who appeared in \"Rocky III\" as a wrestler named Thunderlips, into the WWE Hall of Fame; Stallone was also the person who offered Hogan the small part in Rocky \"III\".\nRevisiting Rocky and Rambo, 2006\u20132008.\nAfter taking a break from making movies, Stallone made a comeback in 2006 with the sixth and final installment of his successful Rocky series; \"Rocky Balboa\", which was both a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box office failure of the previous and presumed last movie \"Rocky V\", Stallone had decided to end the series with a sixth movie which would be a more appropriate ending to the series. The total domestic box office came to $70.3 million (and $155.3 million worldwide). The budget of the movie was only $24 million. His performance in \"Rocky Balboa\" has been praised by mostly positive reviews.\nWhen he was asked in February 2008 about which of the icons he would want to be remembered for, Stallone said \"it's a tough one, but \"Rocky\" is my first baby, so \"Rocky\".\"\nRecent movies.\nStallone worked on \"The Expendables\", starring, writing, and directing. \nHe has said that he wants to adapt the Nelson DeMille novel, \"The Lion's Game\". He wants to direct a movie on Edgar Allan Poe's life, a script that he has been preparing for years. It has also been been confirmed that he will be making a fifth \"Rambo\" movie after the success of the fourth one in 2008.\nFilmography.\nOther movie work.\nStallone's first work as a director came in 1978 with \"Paradise Alley\", which he wrote and starred in. He also directed \"Staying Alive\" (the sequel to \"Saturday Night Fever\"), along with \"Rocky II\", \"Rocky III\", \"Rocky IV\", \"Rocky Balboa\", and \"Rambo\". Stallone wrote all six \"Rocky\" films, He also wrote \"Cobra\", \"Driven\" and \"Rambo.\" He has co-written several other movies, such as \"F.I.S.T.\", \"Rhinestone\", \"Over the Top\" and the first three Rambo movies. His last major success as a co-writer was with 1993's \"Cliffhanger\".\nCompetition with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nStallone has always been considered a opponent to Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action hero actor. Hints to this have been made in both of their movies. In Schwarzenegger's \"Last Action Hero\", Stallone is seen as playing the Terminator in a video advertisement in the film's real life. In Stallone's \"Demolition Man\", there is a futuristic reference to the Arnold Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. Also in the movie \"Twins\", Arnold Schwarzenegger walks by a giant movie poster for \"Rambo III\". He glances at the size of Stallone's biceps on the poster, and then he feels his own and laughs at how much smaller Stallone's are. According to both Stallone and Schwarzenegger, despite their on camera \"rivalry\", they are both very close friends. While promoting the movies \"Rocky Balboa\" and \"Rambo\" on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", Stallone revealed that in the 1980s he and Schwarzenegger looked at each other as \"Cain and Abel.\" Stallone then said that, in the 1990s, he and Arnold became the friends they are today. They became one time business partners in Planet Hollywood.\nPersonal life.\nStallone has been married three times. At age 28, on December 28, 1974, he married Sasha Czack. The couple had two sons, Sage Moonblood (May 5, 1976 - July 13, 2012) and Seargeoh (b. 1979). His younger son was diagnosed with autism at an early age. The couple divorced on February 14, 1985. The same year his divorce finalized, he married model/actress, Brigitte Nielsen, on December 15, 1985, in Beverly Hills, California. His second marriage lasted two years. In May 1997, Stallone married Jennifer Flavin; he has three daughters with her: Sophia Rose (b. 27 August 1996), Sistine Rose (b. 27 June 1998), and Scarlet Rose (b. 25 May 2002).\nPolitics.\nAlthough Stallone is registered as a Republican, he has donated $44,000 to Democratic Party candidates over the years, including $30,000 to the Democratic National Committee, as well as money to the campaigns of Bill Bradley and Joe Biden. However, he has also donated over $33,000 to Republicans over the years and publicly supported John McCain for president in 2008."}

That accident killed 30 people directly, as well as damaging approximately $7 billion of property. A study published in 2005 estimates that there will eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Approximately 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas soon after the accident.\nSome of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. To-date, all of these were units of the former Soviet Union.\nNormal accidents.\nNormal Accidents is a 1984 book by Yale sociologist Charles Perrow, which provides a detailed analysis of complex systems from a social sciences perspective. It was the first to characterize complex technological systems such as nuclear power plants according to their riskiness. Perrow says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly-coupled systems. Such accidents cannot be designed around.\nThe inspiration for Perrow's books was the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, where a nuclear accident resulted from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. The event was an example of a normal accident because it was \"unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable\".\nPerrow's argument rests on three principles. Firstly, people make mistakes, even at nuclear plants. Secondly, big accidents almost always escalate from very small beginnings. Thirdly, many failures are those of organizations more than technology. Each of these principles is still relevant today.\nNuclear submarines.\nSome of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps.

It is also called the great grey kangaroo and the forester kangaroo. An eastern grey male weighs about 66\u00a0kg (145\u00a0lb) and is almost 2\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft) tall. Its scientific name, \"Macropus giganteus\" means gigantic (huge) large-foot, and the eastern grey is the second-biggest marsupial on earth. The red kangaroo is the largest.\nHistory.\nIndigenous Australian names for the eastern grey include \"iyirrbir\" and \"kucha\". The eastern grey kangaroo was first seen by Europeans when Captain James Cook was fixing his ship near Cooktown, Queensland. He took a sample of this unknown aminal back to England to be examined. The eastern grey is also the kangaroo on the Australian Coat of Arms. Captain John Hunter, later Governor of New South Wales painted a watercolour in 1788, of the eastern grey which was published in his book, \"Birds and Flowers of New South Wales, painted on the spot in 1788, 1789 and 1790\". This painting can be seen online here.\nDescription.\nThe eastern grey has a soft grey, or sometimes brown fur. The fur on the chest and stomach is more pale, sometimes white. They have a small head and large ears. Their tails are about long. The male is much larger than the female. They have long eyelashes which protect their eyes from the sun. They live for around 15\u201320 years. Because they are marsupials, the female carries its young in special pouch. Babies are born about five weeks after mating. The tiny baby which is only about 15 millimetres long, and weighs less than one gram, crawls up into the pouch. Inside the pouch there are four nipples. The baby kangaroo, called a joey, will only use one of the nipples. It lives in the pouch for about eight months. It still drinks milk from its mother until about 18 months of age. The mother is able to have another joey in the pouch, which feeds from a different nipple. The mother provides a different mix of milk to each nipple. A joey can remain with its mother until it becomes an adult, at about four years old.\nWhere it lives.\nThe eastern grey is the species most commonly seen in Australia. It lives near the big cities of the south and east coast. It likes open grassland with areas of bush for daytime shelter. Like all kangaroos, it is mainly a nocturnal animal, and it is crepuscular, which means it is active early in the morning, and early in the evening. They live in large groups of up to 100 kangaroos, called \"mobs'.\nWhat it eats.\nThe eastern grey is a herbivore, which means it grass and small shrubs. It mainly eats during early morning and evening. They do not need to drink water as they can get enough moisture from the plants that they eat.\nSpeed.\nThe eastern grey kangaroo can travel very fast over land. They can jump up to in a single leap. The fastest recorded speed of any kangaroo was , set by a large female eastern grey kangaroo. Kangaroos use less energy if they travel faster. When they go slowly, they walk on all four legs, and use their tail as well.\nNumbers.\nIt is often said that kangaroo numbers have increased since the Europen settlement of Australia. There are more areas of grassland and less forest, less dingos, and more man-made watering holes. The current population of the species is about two million. Because of this the eastern grey has been killed in some parts of Australia to stop them from eating all the grass and then dying from starvation."}

It is sometimes called the \"unofficial anthem\" of the American West. The lyrics were first written by Dr. Brewster M. Higley of Smith County, Kansas. He wrote them in a poem called \"My Western Home\" in 1872. In 1947, it became the state song of the U.S. state of Kansas. In 2010, members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 western songs of all time.\nHistory.\nIn 1871, Higley moved from Indiana to Smith County, Kansas. He did this because of the Homestead Act. He lived in a small cabin near West Beaver Creek. He was inspired by his new environment that he decided to create a poem to praise the prairie. The lyrics to \"Home on the Range\" were first published as a poem in the \"Smith County Pioneer\" in 1872 under the title \"My Western Home\". That home is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Home on the Range Cabin.\nThe music was later added by Daniel E. Kelley (1808\u20131905), a carpenter and friend of Higley. The song was eventually used by ranchers, cowboys, and other western settlers. It spread across the United States in different forms. The song has gone by a few different names, the most common being \"Home on the Range\" and \"Western Home\". It was officially chosen as the state song of Kansas on June 30, 1947. It is often thought of as the unofficial anthem of the American West.\nThe most popular version of the song was the version recorded by Bing Crosby on September 27, 1933, with Lennie Hayton and his orchestra for Brunswick Records. It appeared in the various charts of that time.\n\"Home on the Range\" became popular in the 1930s. In fact, former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt said \"Home on the Range\" was his favorite song."}

They react to light and work best in relatively bright light. \nCone cells are less sensitive to light than rod cells. Rod cells are more sensitive, but cannot tell colors apart. Human eyes usually have three different types of cone cells. That allows the brain to tell colors apart. Their reaction to stimuli is faster than that of the rod cells. For this reason, they can perceive finer details, and more rapid changes in images. \nThe three kinds of human cones have different photopsins. Each photopsin has a different response curve to light, and so responds to color in different ways. This gives trichromatic vision. Being color blind means a lack of one or two types of cone cells.\nIn a publication done in 1935, Osterberg thinks that there are about 6 million cone cells in a human eye."}

Her usual musical instrument is a guitar. Her songs include \"Big Yellow Taxi\", \"Woodstock\" (about the 1969 Woodstock Festival), \"Free Man In Paris\", \"Help Me\" and \"Both Sides Now\". Her name Mitchell comes from her first marriage (to Chuck Mitchell).\nShe first began singing folk music while she attended art school, to earn spending money. In time, her songs and style got her noticed, and she became a professional musician. She signed a recording contract, and her first album appeared in 1968. \"Both Sides Now\" also boosted the musical career of Judy Collins, another folksinger, whose cover version became a popular hit. She also performs in the contralto range.\nMitchell had romantic relationships with Stephen Stills and David Crosby, both of the band Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. She also did artwork for one of their album covers. She was scheduled to appear at the Woodstock Festival, as CSN was (joined by Neil Young), but she had to cancel. Her song \"Woodstock\" still became a hit for CSN, and summed up for many people the meaning of the festival.\nDuring the 1970s, Mitchell changed from folk music to jazz, and she lost some of her fans. Many other people enjoyed her later music, though, including an album she made with Charles Mingus, a legendary jazz musician. The album was Mingus's last project before his death.\nNot all of Mitchell's records have been hits, and she resisted compiling a \"best-ofs\" or \"greatest hits\" album for many years, feeling that if she did so, her career would be \"over\". She did finally release a pair of recordings, \"Hits\" (which contained her biggest hit records) and \"Misses\" (which included some of her favorite songs, that were not hits). She continues to perform, and to paint pictures. Her paintings are displayed in galleries around the world.\nBefore she became famous, Mitchell gave up a newborn daughter for adoption in Canada. During the 1990s, the two got back in contact, and now have a good relationship.\nThough she first became famous during the 1960s, Mitchell does not that era. She reminds listeners of the negative parts of it, and encourages them to make the present better.\nIn March 2015, Mitchell was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home. She regained consciousness in an ambulance on her way to hospital, but was taken to intensive care for tests.She had a brain aneurysm. She was diagnosed with a throat tumor later the next day."}

He was one of the greatest conductors of his time. He grew up in Germany, but later became an Austrian and, when the Nazis came to power, he moved to several other countries, finally settling in the United States where he became an American citizen. His name was originally Bruno Schlesinger but from 1896 he was usually known as Bruno Walter. Walter became his official surname in 1911 when he became an Austrian citizen.\nLife.\nEarly life and career.\nBruno was born into a Jewish family in Berlin. He had his early musical education at the Stern Conservatory when he was eight, and played the piano in public when he was nine. He went to concerts which were conducted by the great Hans von B\u00fclow. Two years later, in 1891, he heard Wagner operas in Bayreuth. These experiences made him want to be a conductor.\nBruno started his conducting career at the Cologne Opera in 1894. Later that year he went to the Hamburg Opera to work as a chorus director. There he met and worked with Gustav Mahler, from whom he learned a lot. Mahler found him a job conducting at the opera house in Breslau. This is when he changed his name from Schlesinger (meaning: \u201csomeone from Silesia\u201d) to \u201cWalter\u201d. He then went to Riga, returning to Berlin in 1900 where he conducted at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden where he worked with famous people such as Richard Strauss and Karl Muck.\nIn 1901 Mahler invited Walter to be his assistant at the Court Opera in Vienna. At his first performance he conducted Verdi's \"Aida\". He was becoming very famous all over Europe. He performed in Prague and in London where in 1910 he conducted \"Tristan und Isolde\" and Ethel Smyth's \"The Wreckers\" at Covent Garden. A few months after Mahler's death in 1911, Walter led the first performance of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" in Munich, as well as Mahler's Symphony No. 9 in Vienna the next year.\nYears of fame in Europe.\nWalter became an Austrian citizen in 1911, but two years later he went to Germany to become the Royal Bavarian Music Director in Munich. The next year Walter conducted his first concert in Moscow. He continued to conduct during First World War, conducting operas by composers including Erich Korngold and Hans Pfitzner. Among his friends in Munich was Eugenio Pacelli who later became Pope Pius XII.\nWalter left Munich in 1922 and went to New York the next year. He conducted the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall. He later conducted in Detroit, Minnesota and Boston.\nWhen he returned to Europe, Walter was invited to play in many places, including Berlin Leipzig, Milan (La Scala) and London, where he was chief conductor of the German seasons at Covent Garden from 1924 to 1931.\nIn the late 1920s, the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler often complained that conductors at the Berlin opera were Jews. He often talked about Walter, adding that his real name was \u201cSchlesinger\u201d. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 Walter left Austria. He often conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra and was invited to conduct concerts in New York with the New York Philharmonic. When the Nazi\u2019s took power in Austria (the Anschluss) Walter was conducting in Paris. France offered Walter French citizenship. His daughter was in Vienna. She was arrested by the Nazis, but Walter managed to persuade them to free her.\nLife in United States.\nOn 1 November 1939, he sailed to the United States where he lived for the rest of his life. His home was in Beverly Hills, California. Many people who lived there had fled from Europe because of the Nazis. They became his friends. They included the German writer Thomas Mann. He worked with many famous American orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. After the war he often came back to Europe. He performed at the Edinburgh Festival and in Salzburg, Vienna and Munich. In his later life he made many stereo recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. He made his last live concert appearance on 4 December 1960 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and pianist Van Cliburn. His last recording was a series of Mozart overtures with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra at the end of March in 1961. Bruno Walter died of a heart attack in his Beverly Hills home in 1962.\nHis reputation.\nBetween 1923 and 1961 Walter made hundreds of recordings. The earlier recordings, made at a time when his conducting was at its best, are often rather poor recordings. When he made his last recordings, after stereo records had been invented, he was already quite ill. In his early years he gave some of the first performances of Mahler\u2019s music. He conducted the first performance of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" with the Vienna Philharmonic. In 1936 he made the first recording of the same work with the same orchestra which still had the same leader: Arnold Ros\u00e9 who was Mahler\u2019s brother-in-law. This recording was made just before the Nazi Anschluss which forced Walter and Ros\u00e9 into exile. Many years later, in 1952, Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic once again made a famous recording of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" with the singers Kathleen Ferrier and Julius Patzak. He also recorded Mahler\u2019s Ninth Symphony. Since Walter had worked closely with Mahler, and Mahler had never conducted either of these two great works of his, we can imagine that Walter\u2019s recordings show us how Mahler might have wanted the music to be played.\nWalter made many recordings of other great Germanic composers, such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss II., and Anton Bruckner.\nWalter was known as a kind, modest man, quite unlike some other conductors of the time who behaved like dictators. He was an excellent pianist and sometimes accompanied singers such as Kathleen Ferrier at recitals. He also composed several works. He wrote an autobiography called \u201cTheme and Variations\u201d.\nReferences.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie; 1980, vol 20, pp187\u2013188; ."}

After his school years he studied music at the Conservatory in W\u00fcrzburg. He also studied classical philology at the University of Heidelberg. In 1877 he continued his music studies in Leipzig, learning the piano with Carl Reinecke.

He was a strict conductor who thought it was very important that the players should do exactly what the composer asks for in the score.\nHe was imprisoned in the United States during World War I, because of his support for Germany and because he refused to conduct the \"Star Spangled Banner\". After the war he was sent away and not allowed to return to America.

It has value because a government creates it and backs it, and people using it have faith in its value. Fiat money such as US dollars can be used as an exchange for goods and services.\nThe point is that other kinds of money have been used. Legal tender differs from commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is based on a \"good\", often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which is desired or has other uses. Representative money is a claim on the commodity rather than the actual good. In that case, the gold stays in a bank, and its ownership changes from time to time as the money is used. Why might a good be used at all? One reason is that governments cannot just make it. It is said that this stops inflation because, with fiat money, governments can just print more.\nSome economists argue that an economy can only grow if it can produce more capital goods and not more money in the form of credit. This means that good economies must produce things rather than borrow money to buy things produced in other countries.\nAlan Greenspan was an early critic of fiat money arguing that \"Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth\". He thought the value of money should be backed by gold. Richard Nixon ended gold backing for the United States dollar in 1971. Other countries also changed to Fiat currency."}

At long, it is the second longest river in California, after the Sacramento River. It begins on the west Sierra Nevada Mountains and flows west and north to its end at San Francisco Bay, at the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. \nIts basin, which is about 32,000 square miles (82,879 square kilometers) in size, contains mostly farmland. The river provides drinking water to over 22 million California citizens. Its three largest tributaries are the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers.\nThe river was once one of the richest river ecosystems in California. However, now over of the river is dry except during floods, because lots of water has been taken away for irrigation. In fact, below Friant Dam, a dam built in the 1940s on the San Joaquin River, 95 percent of the river's flow is dry. Much of the river is polluted, destroying the historic population of chinook salmon, once the southernmost in the United States. Pesticides, selenium, and many more toxic materials are carried by the San Joaquin into San Francisco Bay.\nNow, one of the largest projects in the American West has been begun to restore the San Joaquin River. On September 13, 2006, the Natural Resources Defense Council signed an agreement with Friant Dam users and the United States Department of the Interior. This agreement would restore the San Joaquin River below the dam, reducing pollution.\nGeography.\nSource in the Sierra Nevada.\nThree forks of the San Joaquin River join to form the San Joaquin River at two places, called \"Balloon Dome\" and \"Junction Butte\". \nIn the Central Valley.\nThe river continues west into the Central Valley of California, and is joined by many other rivers flowing off the Sierra Nevada mountains. The most largest of these are the Stanislaus River, Tuolumne River, and Merced River. The Tuolumne and Merced river both flow out of Yosemite National Park. \nAs the river flows north and west, it is joined by the following tributaries:\nThe San Joaquin River and its tributaries pass through/feed the following lakes and reservoirs:\nSeveral man-made channels are also part of the river system:\nMouth.\nThe San Joaquin River eventually meets the Sacramento River, forming the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is one of the biggest estuaries in the United States. It is near the city of Antioch. At this place, the San Joaquin River splits into two rivers: the \"Old River\" and the \"Middle River\". The Old River sometimes confuses fish to go down its channel. As a result, a wall is built between the San Joaquin River and the Old River.\nHuman impacts, economy, and development.\nPre-development ecology.\nBefore humans began to develop the Central Valley in the 1850s, the San Joaquin River and its surrounding lands were one of the richest biological habitats in California. In winter, the river would flood the valley, leaving behind wetlands. These wetlands became rich habitat for birds and other animals. The habitat of the endangered \"San Joaquin Kit Fox\" and the \"riparian brush rabbit\" also was near the San Joaquin River. \nFriant Dam: destroying life of the lower San Joaquin.\nIn 1942, a big dam, Friant Dam, was built on the San Joaquin River. This dam took away a lot of water from the river, to irrigate crops, provide drinking water, and provide electricity. The dam destroyed the salmon habitat in the river, and also destroyed the creation of these wetlands. \nThe Friant Dam is:\nNavigation and shipping.\nThe San Joaquin River has been used a lot for shipping of products via boats and ships, otherwise known as navigation. The river was first used for navigation during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Boats carried people over up the river to look for gold in the mountains. Now, there is a channel that runs all the way upriver to the city of Stockton. This channel allows big ships to sail in the river up to this point. Sediment, however, has clogged a lot of the river channel above this point, preventing big ships from going any farther."}

This fjord was cut during previous ice ages. To the west are the very long Appalachian highlands. Near Tappan Zee Bridge, the west side of the river has high cliffs. They are about 400\u2013800 feet high.\nMost of the Hudson Valley is part of the Appalachian Mountains. The northern part of the Hudson Valley is part of the Great Lakes area.\nDuring the last ice age, the valley was filled by a large glacier. The glacier went down as far as Long Island. Near the end of the last ice age, the Great Lakes drained south down the Hudson River. The drained water is called Lake Iroquois. Lake Ontario is the remnant of that lake."}

About 42,000 square miles (108,779 square kilometers) in size, it is about the size of the state of Tennessee. It consists of two connected, differently named valleys, the \"Sacramento Valley\" and the \"San Joaquin Valley\".\nThe Sierra Nevada Mountains border the valley on the east side, while the Coast Range borders it on the west side. The Sacramento River flows through the north part of the Central Valley. This part of the valley is also called the \"Sacramento Valley\". The San Joaquin River flows through the larger south part of the Central Valley. also called the \"San Joaquin Valley\". Both rivers merge eventually and empty into the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay. \nThe capital of California, Sacramento, is located in the north part of the Central Valley. In total, the Central Valley is around long.\nThe Central Valley has 18 California counties. 15 of these counties are among the 25 most productive farmland in California. Overall, the Central Valley economy depends on farming. However, this has led to serious environmental damages, such as pesticides and selenium and other bad materials being washed into the rivers and polluting the San Francisco Bay.\nGeography.\nThe valley floor is a flat, smooth land area covering about 42,000 square miles (108,779 square kilometers) in size, long, and wide. It covers 19 California counties. These counties are:\n-from north to south.\nMountain ranges.\nThe Sierra Nevada mountains are on the east side of the valley. These mountains are very tall and steep. Lots of rivers and streams flow off the Sierra Nevada. The highest mountain in the Sierra Nevada is Mount Whitney (14,495') which is also the tallest mountain in California and the rest of the United States (except for Alaska and Hawaii). On the west side, there is the California Coast Ranges, an extension of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its highest point is approximately 8,848'.\nRivers.\nThe Sacramento River begins in the north part of the Central Valley, near Mount Shasta. It actually begins in the Cascade Range, which are mountains north of the Central Valley, though most of its length is in the Central Valley. The Sacramento River flows south about to San Francisco Bay. Some of its tributaries include the Pit River, Feather River, and American River. All these rivers come off the Sierra Nevada.\nThe San Joaquin River begins at the south Sierra Nevada, and flows west and north into the Central Valley and to San Francisco Bay. Altogether, its length is sone . The San Joaquin is more polluted than the Sacramento, and about of it is actually dry.\nTogether, the Sacramento-San Joaquin river system is the water supply of 22-23 million people in California.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Sacramento Valley (north Central Valley) and San Joaquin Valley are very different. The Sacramento Valley has a \"Mediterranean climate\". This means that it has warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The San Joaquin Valley is much hotter and drier. Most of it is \"Mediterranean steppe\", which is similar to Mediterranean except that it is warmer and drier. Some of it, however, can be close to desert climate. This section of the Central Valley is said to have the worst air quality in California.\nPopulation and economy.\nPopulation centers.\nThe Central Valley is home to about 6.5 million people. The ten largest cities in or near the valley are, by population:\nPopulation density.\nHowever, since most of the land area of the Central Valley is devoted to farming, the population density (amount of people divided by land area) is actually quite low. The population density of the Central Valley is 155 people per square mile (60 people per square kilometer). In contrast, the population density of Los Angeles, the biggest city in California, is 25,904 people per square mile.\nEconomy and agriculture.\nFarming (agriculture) has always been the main economy of the Central Valley. Except for the city of Sacramento, where the focus is on the government, the rest is mostly agricultural. Immigrants provide a large amount of the work done in farms in the Central Valley. Overall, 12.3% of jobs in the Central Valley are directly agriculture related. Not including Sacramento County, the percentage is 16%.\nTransportation.\nThe main road transport routes through the Central Valley are Interstate 5 and California State Route 99. These two highways run from north to south. Interstate 5 is the larger of the two, and carries more traffic. Highway 99 is older than Interstate 5. The Highway 99 separates from Route 5 at the south end of the Central Valley, and joins again at the north end of the valley.\nThe Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) and the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) go through the Central Valley as well. Some of their branch lines include:\nAmtrak is one of the main rail service providers in the Central Valley, and is also popular in much of the rest of California.\nWater supply.\nThe 715-mile (1,150 km) California Aqueduct, the longest aqueduct in California, runs through the Central Valley. Water from the northern Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada goes into this aqueduct. The Central Valley Project is another major water supply project in the Central Valley. This project includes:"}

They are:\nIt can be broken down to \"Buffaloa buffalon Buffaloa buffalon buffalov buffalov Buffaloa buffalon\", where \"a\" is adjective, \"n\" is noun, and \"v\" is verb. It means, \"Bison from Buffalo, which other bison from Buffalo confuse, confuse the bison from Buffalo.\"\nOther words can be used to make sentences like this one. These include \"police\", \"fish\", and \"people\". For example, \"Fish fish fish fish fish\". Other times, similar words that are spelled differently can be used: \"Foul fowl foul fowl foul foul foul fowl\".\nWhy it is confusing to read.\nThe sentence is very confusing because:"}

They were usually emirates or little kingdoms, but there was one oligarchy as well, Seville. A number were formed in the Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia) after the end of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cord\u00f3ba in 1031.\nThey developed because of an administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba and an ethnic division of its elite. It was divided among Arabs (a powerful but tiny minority), Berbers, Eastern European former slaves and Iberian Muslims (known as \"Mulad\u00edes\" (the great majority). \nThere was a second period when \"taifa\"s developed: the middle of the 12th century, when the Almoravid dynasty was in decline.\nIn the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century, the emirs (rulers) of the \"taifa\"s kept fighting among themselves, not only militarily but also for cultural . They tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans.\nAfter the end of the Caliphate, the rival Muslim kingdoms were much weaker than the Christian ones and so they had to submit and to pay tribute. \nThe \"taifa\" princes appealed for North African warriors to help them fighting Christian kings on two occasions. The Almoravids were invited after the fall of Toledo (1085), the Almohads after the fall of Lisbon (1147). The warriors did not help the \"taifa\" emirs but rather annexed their lands to their own North African empires.\nTaifas often hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms (both Christian and Muslim). The most dynamic \"taifa\", which conquered most of its neighbours before the Almoravid invasion, was Seville. Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive, but was kept in check by the neighbour Christian states of the Pyrenees.

For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system. Because \"dec\" means 10, it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9. Most people think that we most often use base 10 because we have 10 fingers.\nA base is usually a whole number bigger than 1, although are also mathematically possible. The base of a number may be written next to the number: for instance, formula_1 means 23 in base 8 (which is equal to 19 in base 10). \nIn computers.\nDifferent bases are often used in computers. Binary (base 2) is used because at the most simple level, computers can only deal with 0s and 1s. Hexadecimal (base 16) is used because of how computers group binary digits together. Every four binary digits turn into one hexadecimal digit when changing between them. Because there are more than 10 digits in hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are shown as A, B, C, D, E, and F.\nMeasurement.\nThe oldest systems of counting used base one. Making marks on a wall, using one mark for each item counted is an example of unary counting. Some old systems of measurement use the duodecimal radix (base twelve). This is shown in English, as there are words such as dozen (12) and gross (144 = 12\u00d712), and lengths such as feet (12 inches). Angle measurement often uses a system adapted from the Babylonian numerals with base 60.\nWriting bases.\nWhen typing a base, the small number indicating the base is usually in base ten. This is because if the radix were written in its own base, it would always be \"10,\" so there would be no way of knowing what base it was supposed to be in.\nNumbers in different bases.\nHere are some examples of how some numbers are written in different bases, compared to decimals:"}

It lives in the sea. It is sometimes called the \"blue bubble\", or \"man-of-war\". Its common name comes from a Portuguese war ship of the 15th and 16th century. The ship had triangular sails, similar in shape to the bladder of the man o' war.\nThe Portuguese Man o' War has a reputation for swarming in groups of thousands. It is also known for its powerful sting.\nStructure.\n\"Physalia\" is not a single animal: it is a siphonophore. This is a colony of four kinds of zooids. Zooids are very small, highly modified individuals. These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids. Though structurally similar to other cnidarians, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid does not have some structure and functions. It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.\nA similar group of animals are the chondrophores. They are specialized hydroids, which also float at the surface of the open ocean.\nPredators.\nThe loggerhead turtle feeds on the Portuguese man o' war. It is a common part of the turtle's diet. The skin of the turtle is too thick for the man o' war's sting to enter and launch its venom. The sea slug \"Glaucus atlanticus\" and the violet snail \"Janthina janthina\" also feed on the Portuguese man o' war. The blanket octopus \"Tremoctopus\" is immune to the venom of the Portuguese man o' war. The blanket octopus has been known to rip off the man o' war's tentacles and use them for defensive purposes.\nCommensalism and symbiosis.\nThe Portuguese man o' war is often found with many different kinds of marine fish. Some of them are shepherd fish, clown fish, and yellow jack. These species are rarely found anywhere else. The clown fish can swim among the tentacles without being stung. This is possibly due to its mucus that does not trigger the nematocysts. The shepherd fish seems to avoid the larger, stinging tentacles. It feeds on the smaller tentacles under the gas bladder. These fish benefit from the shelter of the stinging tentacles. It also helps the man o' war: the presence of these species may attract other fish to feed on."}

It can last from under a second to about 30 seconds. It may happen as a result of sleep deprivation, fatigue, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or hypersomnia. Microsleeps can occur at any time. Most of the time, they do so without warning. When people have a microsleep during conversation, they may lose track of the subject that was talked about. \nMicrosleep can be extremely dangerous in situations when people drive a car, work on a machine or otherwise need to stay alert. People with microsleeps usually are not aware of them. They instead believe that they were awake all the time. One example is called \"gap driving\": a person is driving a car and suddenly realizes that several seconds have passed by unnoticed. The driver does not feel that she or he has been asleep during those missing seconds, although this is in fact what happened. The sleeping driver is at very high risk for having an accident during microsleep. \nMany accidents and catastrophes have resulted from microsleep episodes in these circumstances. For example, a microsleep episode is claimed to have been one factor contributing to the Waterfall train disaster in 2003; the driver had a heart attack and the guard who should have reacted to the train's increasing speed is said by his defender to have microslept.

It mostly focuses on newspapers, radio, television, and internet. Media studies take some ideas from other areas of study, such as humanities and the social sciences.\nMost production and journalism courses use media studies content, but academic institutions such as universities often start separate departments. Media studies students may see themselves as observers of media, not creators or practitioners. These distinctions are different depending on the country where students live.\nThe development of media studies was sparked by the growth of new media in the post-Second World War period. A typical source was Marshall McLuhan's \"Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man\". This book set out to connect changes in media with changes in society. His most famour phrase was \"The medium is the message\"."}

Hurricane Mitch was one of the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. Mitch was the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane because it killed 11,000-18,000 in Central America and Mexico, it is second only to the Great Hurricane of 1780. Mitch also caused over $5 billion in damage. Because the damage and deaths were very high, the name \"Mitch\" was retired and will never be used for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean again. It was in 1998 and hit Florida, Central America, and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nMeteorologic history.\nOn October 10 a tropical wave moved off of Africa. It stayed as a tropical wave because the conditions in Atlantic wasn't good enough for it to become a tropical depression or tropical storm. The tropical wave became Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 22, because conditions became better. On October 23 Tropical Depression Thirteen strengthened and became Tropical Storm Mitch. Tropical Storm Mitch made a small loop after becoming a tropical storm and then turned north. \nTropical Storm Mitch strengthened and became Hurricane Mitch on October 24. Hurricane Mitch then turned west. Mitch strengthened very fast and on October 26 Mitch reached its top winds. Its top winds were are 180 mph making it a category 5. Mitch stayed as a category 5 turned south. \nMitch started weakening on October 27 and by October 29 Mitch was only a category 1. On October 29 Hurricane Mitch made landfall in Honduras, with the winds at 80 mph. Mitch quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Mitch moved very slowly and almost froze over Honduras. Tropical Storm Mitch weakened into a tropical depression as it entered Guatemala. \nAs Tropical Depression Mitch entered Mexico it became a remnant low and was not a tropical depression anymore. The remains entered the Bay of Campeche and became Tropical Storm Mitch again on November 3. Mitch moved northeast and made landfall in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Mitch weakened into a tropical depression over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Once Tropical Depression Mitch reached the Gulf of Mexico it became Tropical Storm Mitch. Tropical Storm Mitch continued northeast and made landfall in Naples, Florida on November 5 as a tropical storm with the winds at 65 mph. \nAfter Tropical Storm Mitch crossed Florida it became extratropical and was no longer a tropical storm. The remains were last seen on November 9 north of Great Britain. \nImpact.\nMany countries of the in Central American Region had record amounts of rainfall.\nHonduras.\nThe worst affects from the hurricane were seen in Honduras, where Mitch caused 7,000 deaths and $3.8 billion in damage. In Honduras rainfall could have been up to 75 inches. Crops in Honduras were impacted very badly, Mitch destroyed, 58% of the corn output, 24% of sorghum, 14% of rice, and 6% of the bean crop. Mitch also destroyed 85% of banana, 60% of sugar cane, 29% of melons, 28% of African palms, and 18% of coffee. Just the crop damage from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras was at $900 million. \nNicaragua.\nAlso in Nicaragua rainfall may have been up to 50 inches. The rains stopped a volcano in Nicaragua, instead the volcano caused a mudslide. The mudslide covered an area 10 miles long and 5 miles wide. Hurricane Mitch left between 500,000 and 800,000 people homeless. Damaged in Nicaragua totaled to $1 billion and at least 3,800 were killed in Nicaragua. \nFlorida.\nIn the U.S. only Florida was affected. In Florida, Mitch destroyed buildings in the Keys that were damaged by Hurricane Georges. Mitch killed 2 people and left $40 million in damage. \nOther places.\nHurricane Mitch caused rain all the way down to Panama, where the hurricane killed 3 people. Offshore in the Caribbean Sea the hurricane sunk a boat causing 31 people to drown. In Costa Rica Hurricane Mitch caused about 4,000 people to become homeless. Hurricane Mitch caused mudslides that affected nearly 800 miles of road. Hurricane Mitch left $92 million in damage and killed 7 people. In El Salvador the flooding from Mitch destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% of the corn production, and 20% losses in sugar canes. Hurricane Mitch also killed 10,000 cattle. In El Salvador the damage from Mitch was at $400 million and 240 people were killed. In Guatemala Hurricane Mitch caused 6,000 houses to be destroyed and damaged 20,000 others. Damage just the banana and coffee exports were at $325 million. Mitch caused a plane to crash leaving 11 people to get killed indirectly, Mitch also caused 268 people to get killed directly. Damages left from Mitch in Guatemala was at $748 million. In Belize Mitch caused some crop damage and damage many roads. Damage in Belize was not as bad as it could have been. Mitch killed 11 in Belize, but no one knows the damage it caused. \nHurricane Mitch caused waves about 7 feet in Jamaica. Mitch killed about 3 people, but no one knows the damage. Also, a house in Spanish Town was destroyed. \nRetirement.\nBecause of the deaths and damage the name Mitch was removed and retired. Meaning, the name will not be used again to name a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. In 2004 the name Matthew was used instead. The name Matthew will be used again in 2010 because it was not retired."}

It forms when the particles that make it up have very low energy. Only bosons can make a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. The gas has extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air.\nA Bose\u2013Einstein condensate is a change of state. When matter is in the BEC state it has zero viscosity. Superfluidity and superconductivity are both closely connected with the BEC state of matter.\nTheory.\nParticles have energy. They can have a lot of energy and bounce wildly like in gases; have less energy and flow like a liquid; or have even less energy like a solid. If you take enough of the particle's energy away you get to the tiniest or the smallest amount of energy possible. This is a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. This makes all of the particles exactly the same and instead of bouncing around randomly in all different directions, they all bounce up and down in exactly the same way, forming something called a 'giant matter wave'.\nHistory.\nThe Bose-Einstein Condensate was first suggested by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924\u201325. Seventy years later, its existence was proved. Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman made the first Bose\u2013Einstein condensate in 1995 at the University of Colorado. Cornell, Wieman,and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT were then given the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nExperiments.\nUsually, to get anything cold enough to make a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate you must first trap the boson using magnets, then, by bouncing lasers off them, take all of their energy away (Laser cooling). But, this still doesn't get it cold enough. Some of the particles will still be bouncing around a lot, and only some will be lying down as needed, so the magnetic field is slowly lowered bit by bit, to let the faster bouncing particles out. This leaves the coldest and slowest atoms inside."}

She was the English author of \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\", and is one of the most famous cookbook writers.\nBackground.\nIsabella was born at 24 Milk Street, Cheapside, London, England. Her father, Benjamin Mayson, died when she was young and her mother, Elizabeth Jerram later married Henry Dorling, who was a widower and he had four children of his own. They lived in Epsom, Surrey where Henry was Clerk of Epsom Racecourse. Isabella was sent to school in Heidelberg, Germany, where she became a very good pianist. When she finished school, she went back to Epsom.\nMarriage and career.\nIsabella's husband, Samuel Orchart Beeton, was also born in Milk Street. Even after the move to Epsom the two mothers of Samuel and Isabella kept talking to one another. On a visit to London, Isabella was introduced to Samuel Beeton who had become a publisher of books and popular magazines. They married on 10 July 1856 at Epsom Parish Church. In August of that year they moved into their first home, a large Italianate property at 2 Chandos Villas on the Woodridings Estate in Hatch End.\nTheir first child, Samuel Orchart, was born in May 1857 but he died of croup in August of that year. In September 1859, another son was born, and his name was also Samuel Orchart.\nDuring Isabella's time in Hatch End she began to write articles on cooking and how to manage a house for her husband's publications. In 1859\u20131861, she wrote something every month for \"The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine\". In October 1861, the writings were published as a single book, \"The Book of Household Management\".\nThe Beetons left Hatch End in the autumn of 1861. In December of that year their son became sick with scarlet fever while on holiday in Brighton. He died on New Year's Eve. Mrs. Beeton gave birth to two other sons, Orchart (on New Year's Eve in 1863) and Mayson Moss (in January 1865).\n\"Book of Household Management\".\nThe book was very well known as \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\", it was a guide to running a Victorian household, with advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, and industrialism.\nThe book had 1,112 pages, and over 900 of the pages were recipes. Because many of the pages were recipes, it became known as \"Mrs Beeton's Cookbook\". Most of the recipes were illustrated with colored pictures, and it was the first book to show recipes in a way that is still used today. It is said that many of the recipes were actually taken from earlier writers (including Eliza Acton), but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was supposed to be a guide of reliable information for the middle class people. Mrs Beeton is described better as the books compiler and editor than as its author, because many of the passages were not in her own words.\nEarly death.\nThe day after the birth of her fourth child, in January 1865, Isabella became sick with puerperal fever. She died a week later at the age of 28. Her widower lived for another twelve years. He died of tuberculosis in June 1877 at the age of 46.\nThe couple are buried in West Norwood Cemetery in Lambeth under a simple headstone."}

It includes the states of Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.\nGeography.\nThe South Region has an area of , the smallest region of the country.\nIt is the only region of Brazil located outside the tropical zone, with clear variations about the seasons. In winter there are frosts and rarely snow. The relief is just a bit hilly, with a predominance of a large plateau, in general low.\nIt borders to the north with the Mato Grosso do Sul and S\u00e3o Paulo states; to the east with the Atlantic Ocean; to the south with Uruguay states; and to west with Argentina and Paraguay.\nHydrography.\nThe hydrography of Southern Brazil can be classified in three great regions of Watersheds: the Paran\u00e1 River, the Uruguay River and the Southeast Brazil Rivers.\nThe rivers of the southern region are availed for navigation, irrigation agriculture, urban water supply and power generation. The most important rivers are voluminous and have great hydroelectric potential. The Itaipu Dam, on the Parana River, is exploring the potential for power generation in the region. This operation allows the South and the Southeast an increasing use of electricity for domestic and industrial use.\nRelief.\nThe relief of the region is characterized by many plateaus that rises at altitudes up to more than 1,000 meters above sea level, decreasing to the west. Covering about 3/4 parts of the regional relief, this set is called \"Southern Plateau of Brazil\" and breaks down into plateaus that go from east to west.\nThe highest point of the different states of the South Region are:\nClimate.\nOnly Brazilian region located almost entirely in a subtropical climate, the South is the coldest area of Brazil, with frost and even, in some places, the snowfall. The seasons are well defined and the rains are evenly distributed over the year.\nSouthern Brazil has subtropical or temperate climate. The annual average temperatures vary between 12\u00a0\u00b0C (53.6\u00a0\u00b0F) and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (71.6\u00a0\u00b0F). Frost is very common and can snow in some mountain ranges.\nStates.\nThis region is formed by three states: Paran\u00e1, Paran\u00e1 and Rio Grande do Sul.\nPanorama.\nWhat most characterizes the South is the way it was colonized and kind of colonizers received. Received short black slaves, but many Caucasian immigrants. The Europeans gave the population the predominance of white skin color, gave to the landscape marks of their original countries and introduced the system of medium and small farms.\nThe southern region has good social indicators : it has the highest HDI in Brazil (0.831), and the third highest GDP per capita of the country. The region is also, 94.8% of the population.\nThe region is highly urbanized (82%) and many cities are famous for their urban planning, like Curitiba and Maring\u00e1. It has a relatively high standard of living in many aspects, with the highest Human Development Index of Brazil, 0.859 (2007), and the second highest per capita income of the country, $13.396. The region is also the most literate, 94% literacy rate.\nSome places in the region must be emphasized, such as the Igua\u00e7u Falls, (Natural Heritage and one of the New7Wonders of Nature) and the Ruins of St. Michael of the Missions (Cultural Heritage); the Itaipu Dam, elected the as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World); the winter cities on mountains of the SC and RS; and the Botanical Garden of Curitiba, Southern Brazil greatest icon.\nHistory.\nThe first inhabitants of southern Brazil are the indigenous people. Then came the Spanish Jesuit priests to evangelize the Indians and dominate the land. The pioneers of S\u00e3o Paulo attacked the missions to arrest the Indians. So, the Jesuits and the Indians abandoned the place and the cattle got loose in the fields. The S\u00e3o Paulo pioneers became interested in the trade of cattle.

He used to be the Minister-President of the state of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union party (CSU). On 18 January 2007, he said he no longer wanted to be minister-president and party leader by 30 September, after having been by his own party for weeks.\nEarly life.\nEdmund Stoiber was born in Oberaudorf in the district of Rosenheim, Bavaria. Before he became a member of the Bavarian parliament in 1974, he was a lawyer and worked at the University of Regensburg. \nStoiber is married to Karin Stoiber. They have three children: Konstanze (1971), Veronika (1977), Dominik (1980) and three grandchildren: Johannes (1999), Benedikt (2001) and Theresa Marie (2005).\nEducation and profession.\nStoiber was a student at Ignaz-G\u00fcnther-Gymnasium in Rosenheim, where he received his Abitur (high school diploma) in 1961. He served the military with the mountain infantry division but had to leave because he hurt his knee. After his military service, Stoiber studied political science and later law in Munich. In 1967 he passed the state law exam and then worked at the University of Regensburg in criminal law and Eastern European law. He became a doctor of jurisprudence, and then in 1971 passed the second state examination.\nPolitical career.\nIn 1978 Stoiber was elected secretary general of the CSU, which he stayed until 1982/83. From 1982 to 1986 he was a representative to the Bavarian secretary of the state and then a minister of state from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1993 he was the Bavarian Minister of the Interior and in May 1993, the Bavarian \"Landtag\" (parliament) elected him as minister-president. As such he served as President of the \"Bundesrat\" in 1995/96. In 1998, he was made leader of the CSU.\nRunning for Chancellor.\nIn 2002, Stoiber removed the leader of the CDU, Angela Merkel, and was made the joint CDU/CSU's candidate for the office of chancellor, with Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (SPD) as opponent.\nBefore the 2002 election, the CSU/CDU was on top of the opinion polls and Stoiber said that \"...this election is like a football match where it's the second half and my team is ahead by 2-0\", a quote that has become famous. However, on election day things had changed. The SPD had a huge comeback and the CDU/CSU got less votes. Both the SPD and CDU/CSU had 38.5% of the vote, but the SPD was ahead by 6,000 votes. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was elected again as chancellor by the parliament. He joined together with the Green party. Many people think it was Stoiber's reaction to the floods in eastern Germany, shortly before the election, that made his party lose the vote. Also, Schr\u00f6der made clear that he was against the Iraq war led by the United States. He made the war the main topic in his campaign, which was seen by many people as the changing factor in the weeks before the election.\nOutside politics.\nStoiber is a great football fan and he supports the FC Bayern Munich. Before the 2002 election FC Bayern's manager Uli Hoene\u00df said he supported Stoiber and the CSU. Football legend, FC Bayern President and Vice-President of the German Football Association, Franz Beckenbauer, on the other hand, showed his support for Stoiber by letting him join the German national football team on their flight home from Japan after the 2002 FIFA World Cup."}

{"id": "176105", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176105", "title": "Los Angeles River", "text": " \nThe Los Angeles River (also called: El Rio De Nuestra Senora La Reina De Los Angeles De Porciuncula or Porciuncula River; Spanish: \"River of the Angels\"; informally LA River) is a river flowing through Los Angeles County, California, in the United States. About long, it flows from Canoga Park south and west to its end at the Long Beach Harbor, in San Pedro Bay, part of the Pacific Ocean. The basin is rimmed by the San Gabriel Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains, as well as several smaller mountain ranges. Much of the water that flows in the Los Angeles River flows in from tributaries that come from the mountains.\nThe river was once free-flowing, winding across a floodplain that occupied much of the Los Angeles Basin. With its frequent floods, it often changed course, causing erosion and depositing silt in other places. When the city of Los Angeles had its first settlers around the 1850s, the river was its main water source. With the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, the Los Angeles River was no longer needed as a water source. Today, the Los Angeles River runs in a fixed course through a concrete channel for nearly its whole length. It is heavily polluted. The primary source of water during summer and fall is the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys. Plans for restoration of the river are being discussed.\nWatershed.\nThe watershed of the Los Angeles River covers 834 square miles (2,135 square kilometers). The Santa Monica Mountains and smaller Simi Hills border it on the east side. On the west side lies the San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains. Seven major tributaries flow into the Los Angeles River: Burbank Western Channel, Aliso Wash, Tujunga Wash, Verdugo Wash, Arroyo Seco, Compton Creek, and Rio Hondo. 360 square miles (920 square kilometers) of the watershed are open space, while the remaining 474 square miles (1,215 square kilometers) are highly developed with all kinds of land uses.\nThe river officially begins in a place called Canoga Park, in the San Fernando Valley. Bell Creek and Calabasas Wash (Arroyo Calabasas or Calabasas Creek; \"Calabasa\" is Spanish for \"pumpkin\") flow from opposite sides of the valley to a point () where the Los Angeles River officially begins. At this point, the river already flows in a concrete channel. In times of flood, the channel can move between per hour to up to \n or even per hour.\nTujunga Wash, Aliso Wash, and Brown's Canyon Wash join the river from the left. The river flows on to a basin called the \"Sepulveda basin\", controlled by a dam at its southeastern end. This basin is incredibly rich in wildlife and plants. Normally, there wouldn not be a year-round flow of water here. But because of 75 million gallons of water flowing into the river every day from the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, there is an year-round flow of water. This water is not suitable to be drinking water, but is safe to touch.\nAn important tributary, Verdugo Wash, flows in from the left. The Verdugo Wash begins in the Verdugo Hills and flows west to the Los Angeles River. Uniquely, the intersection of Interstate 5 and Route 134 is located right above this point. The Los Angeles River makes a great bend west around Griffith Park, a big park in the middle of Los Angeles. Here, the river has an earthen bottom, which is unique because most of the river is covered with concrete. Further downstream, there is a place uniquely named \"Frogtown\" because of the many frogs once found in the river there. Downstream from this place, the river picks up another important tributary, Arroyo Seco, on the left. (The name \"Arroyo Seco\" means \"dry creek\" in Spanish.) The Arroyo Seco begins in the San Gabriel Mountains and flows south to the Los Angeles River. One important feature of the Arroyo Seco is the giant Devil's Gate Dam. The Arroyo Seco is free-flowing in many places.\nAfter flowing a few more miles, the Los Angeles River becomes very wide. The final large tributary, Rio Hondo (Spanish for \"deep river\") flows in from the left, in the city of South Gate. Notably, the sediment here is over deep. Here, the threat of floods is always present. In fact, in a flood in 1992, the water was only a few inches below the top of the riverbank. As the river approaches San Pedro Bay and eventually the Pacific Ocean, it passes by the RMS Queen Mary, a retired ocean liner now a museum and hotel.\nHistory.\nOriginal river.\nThe Los Angeles River was originally a free-flowing river, running across a wide basin that would periodically flood. The river would have heavy flows in the winter and spring (rainy season) and little to no flow in the summer and fall (dry season). However, water being forced out of an aquifer below the Los Angeles Basin gave parts of the river an year-round flow. This phenomenon can still be seen today, most notably in a place called Griffith Park where water rises out of the ground and feeds the river.\nNative American era to Spanish settlement.\nThe river was used for hundreds of years by pre Columbian natives as a source of drinking water and food. When Spanish explorers came to the area in the 1760s, they named the river the Porciuncula, seeing that it was a good site for a settlement. The full name they gave the river was actually \"El R\u00edo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora La Reina de Los \u00c1ngeles de Porci\u00fancula\", which translated to English means: The River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porci\u00fancula. (Porciuncula is a small church in Italy.) But they were to soon find out, the Los Angeles River had, and still has, a long history of floods. Many times when the river flooded, it would change course from Ballona Creek, a stream flowing into Santa Monica Bay on the northeast; to its original channel flowing into San Pedro Bay. One big flood in 1825, it left Ballona Creek and flowed into its old channel, and Ballona Creek became a separate, long waterway. It still is that way today.\nLate 1800s to early 1900s.\nThe city of Los Angeles rose beside the Los Angeles River, inland at the site of the old Spanish settlement. In 1889, San Pedro Bay, the place where the river flows into, was chosen as the city harbor. A series of railroads were needed to connect the city with the port. The most logical route was beside the river, since that was the smoothest land. With the railroads came industry, which rose up all along the lower Los Angeles River. With its disastrous flood history, and the fact that it was too shallow for boats, the river was finally forced into a concrete channel beginning in 1938.\nLos Angeles Flood of 1938.\n1938 was the same year that a terrible flood struck the region. From February 27 to March 1, 1938, a storm approached the California coast. Over 4.4 inches (11\u00a0cm) of rain fell. That was the equivalent of one-fourth the average yearly rainfall in the area. Finally, on 5:45 AM on March 4, the rain ended, and the flood slowly dropped in level. it seemed similar to the earlier flood in 1934. Everyone thought that it was already over, but it was not. 15 hours later, another storm hit Southern California, dumping another 6-10 inches (15\u201325\u00a0cm) of rain. The soils of the region could not take in any more water from the rains of the past few days. The three major rivers in the region, the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and the Santa Ana, burst their levees and flooded three California counties.\nIt was the 5th largest flood in the recorded history of the area. 5,601 houses were destroyed, 1,500 houses were damaged, and 800 cars were trapped in the mud. But Los Angeles County was not as affected as neighboring Riverside County and Orange County, for it was those two counties that suffered the worst floods.\nHowever, the flood was not as bad as it could have been. Fourteen flood control dams in the mountains and around the Los Angeles area held back huge amounts of water, which would otherwise add to the flood. These dams included the Hansen Dam, Big Tujunga Dam, and San Gabriel No. 1 and No. 2. At its peak, the Los Angeles River's flow was about 38,000 cubic feet (1,076 cubic meters) per second. The nearby San Gabriel River's flow, though, approached 100,000 cubic feet (2,832 cubic meters) per second. Most flooded of all was the \"crazy-mad\" Santa Ana River, which looked like a \"slightly smaller version of the Mississippi.\"\nRestoration.\nMany restoration efforts to convert the river from a concrete-lined channel back to its natural state have been proposed recently. Also, some river conservation groups, most notably Friends of the Los Angeles River (FoLAR) have been created.\nThe Los Angeles River Master Plan was created in 1991 as a plan to restore a large stretch of the river and one of its large tributaries, the Tujunga Wash. Part of the incentive for the project is because the \"Great Wall of Los Angeles\", one of the largest murals in the world, is painted on the wall of the Tujunga Wash. Other than that, the plan seeks to improve recreation, health, property value, environment, and education in the communities surrounding the river; by building a series of parks. This helps to increase the open space available in Los Angeles; its open space percentage is uncharacteristically low. For example, the city of Boston has 9% open space, over twice as much as Los Angeles' 4% open space.\nNotably, the City of Los Angeles agreed in 2007, by a 12-0 vote, to spend some $2 billion USD over the next 50 years. The money will be used to fund over 200 separate projects, including parks, walkways, and pedestrian bridges; along a stretch of the river. Some factories and other buildings near the river will be removed so houses can be built closer to the river.\nRiverside communities.\nThe biggest city beside the Los Angeles River is Los Angeles. There are many other cities and towns that lie beside the river.\nCrossings.\nBridges that cross the Los Angeles River. Crossings are listed from south to north."}

Chord progressions are important for people who write songs or play musical instruments that can play chords, such as the guitar. Chord progressions are used in many types of music. How a piece of music sounds has to do with its chord progression.\nRelation to the circle of fifths.\nThe circle of fifths is an idea in music theory that has to do with keys. It also has to do with chord progressions. If you have a song with the chord progression G, C, D, you can see those chords are right next to each other in the circle. So if you want to play the same song in a different key, you can use any other three chords right next to each other. This works for any chord progression.\nCommon chord progressions.\nOne of the most used chord progressions is based on the first, fourth and fifth notes of a major scale. In the key of C, these are the C, F, and G chords. This progression is used in many simple songs. Since these songs have only three chords, they are sometimes called three-chord songs. Many country, blues, rock, pop and punk songs are three-chord songs."}

The term was used in the early 19th century by the philosopher and founding sociologist, Auguste Comte.\nComte, a sociologist, believed in a three part model of human knowledge. He claimed that it had gone through phases. There was a religious worldview, and a metaphysical worldview before the scientific interpretation was considered. The positivistic method should, said Comte, no longer aim at a revealing ultimate causes. It should rather focus on how data are linked together. Scientists would simply interpret these correlations. All human knowledge could only be relatively true, so Comte with a look at these interpretations. Late 19th-century philosophers of the sciences from Heinrich Hertz to Ernst Mach eventually discussed specific requirements of operable scientific theories and physical laws such as the predictability of results in experiments and the functionality of laws in computations.\nPrinciples.\nIn its strongest original formulation, positivism could be thought of as a set of five principles:\nUnlike materialists positivists do not make any claims about a primary substance such as matter. They assume that we have data and that we interpret the data. The idea of a material world with three dimensions is, for positivists, just a good model to handle the experiences of everyday life. If astronomy has to deal with more complex data that cannot be handled consistently in such a model, they will have to think of a different model. Early 20th-century positivists like Ernst Mach said that the best model is the most \"economical\" model, that is the model we can use best in calculations and predictions.\nThe idea that all physical laws could be useful dates back to Auguste Comte. Comte said that all theories were merely \"relatively\" true, and that even Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation was strictly speaking nothing but a social convention true until new data force us to find a better theory.\nLogical positivism.\nThis was an important development in early 20th century Vienna, led by Moritz Schlick and widened by Ludwig Wittgenstein. The logical positivists held that statements that cannot be proven true or false have no meaning.\nIt held not only that propositions were true or false, but that statements which could not be shown to be either true or false were meaningless. Thus statements like \"There is a God\" or \"There is no God\" are not true or false, but meaningless because they cannot be proven or disproven.\nOperationalism.\nThis was the idea of P.W. Bridgman, Nobel Prize in Physics for 1946. It was that a concept in science was defined by the way one measured it. If one thinks of electron spin, or the curvature of space, these are not everyday ideas. In everyday life, electrons are not seen, and neither is space seen to be curved. They rest on the results of experiments which measured fundamental properties like time, light, mass, electrical charge, and so on. What Bridgman meant is that their meaning is in the way the measurements were done.\nComtean positivism.\n19th-century positivism \u2013 or \"Comtean positivism\" \u2013 included the outline of a proposed development. This would lead from primitive explanations, through religious thought and monotheism, to positivism as the universal theory and scientific practice. The theory was very influential among cultural historians. It led Comte to the creation a \"religion of humanity\" as a secular substitute for all religions. This caused an outcry among scientists, who were ready to adopt the scientific premises but not interested in creating a substitute religion.\nOne can today still visit temples in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and Curitiba in Brazil, and Paris built by 19th-century Comtean positivists. London had a society of positivists. The Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk was strongly interested in positivism as the basis of a secularisation of the nation, he was trying to build.\nThe term positivism is today no longer connected to the construct of a secular religion, but more to describe a scientific method."}

It includes antivirus, firewall, e-mail filter, and phishing protection software. It also includes features like parental controls which can be downloaded as an add-on.\nNorton Internet Security was replaced by Norton Security in 2014.\nNorton Internet Security was available from a download, a box copy in a store, or from a company that is an OEM. Norton Internet Security and its sister product, Norton AntiVirus, combined, held a 61% antivirus market share as of 2007. Major competitors in terms of market share include antivirus products from vendors CA, Trend Micro, and Kaspersky Lab.\nNorton Internet Security runs on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Version 22.5.2.15 was the last update available for Norton Internet Security for Windows computers. The latest Mac version is 4.0.\nWindows edition.\nIn August 1990 Symantec acquired Peter Norton Computing from Peter Norton. Norton and his company developed various utilities, or applications for DOS. Symantec continued the development of acquired technologies. The technologies are marketed under the name of \"Norton\", with the tagline \"from Symantec\". Norton's crossed-arm pose, a registered U.S. trademark, was featured on Norton product packaging. However, his pose was later moved to the spine of the packaging, and later dropped altogether.\nProduct activation was introduced to Norton Internet Security 2004, addressing the estimated 3.6 million counterfeit Norton products sold. A alphanumeric code is generated to identify a computer's configuration, which ties in with the product key. Users are allowed to activate their product five times with the same product key. Spyware detection and removal was introduced to the 2005 version for Windows, with the tagline \"Antispyware Edition\". The tagline was dropped in later releases.\nExisting users of the 2006, 2007, or 2008 versions can upgrade to the latest 2009 version without buying a new subscription. Upgrading will preserve the number of days left on a user's subscription.\nVersion 2006 (13.0).\nNorton Internet Security 2006 debuted on September 26, 2005. The main graphical user interface, dubbed the Norton Protection Center aggregates all information in a central location. CNET reports the Norton Protection Center, while useful, attempts to advertise additional products and services from Symantec.\nTo help identify zero-day malware, Bloodhound technology disassembles and scans application code for possibly malicious instructions. Norton can revert Internet Explorer homepage hijacking attempts and block advertisements. Users are warned of unauthorized changes to Internet Explorer's homepage, and given an option to revert such changes. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. E-mail filtering scans POP3 mail for spam. It can be configured using either a blacklist or a whitelist. Users can also correct Norton's classification of e-mail on an individual basis. Parental controls, bundled with this release, allow users to block specific sites, block certain programs from accessing the Internet, and restrict newsgroup access. Norton can block the transmission of confidential information. Users can enter information which are not to be communicated via instant messenger, e-mail, or webforms.\nCNET noted this version's noticeable toll on system performance, especially when opening files across a network or on a removable disk. Oli Warner also noted Norton's significant drag when opening or creating files, compared to similar offerings from different vendors. PC Magazine noted the program's lengthy installation time and weak spam filtering feature; valid e-mail messages were marked as spam and actual spam e-mail were not.\nWindows 98 compatibility was dropped from this release. System requirements were Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 or Windows XP, 325 Megabytes of free hard drive space, a 300\u00a0MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM.\nVersion 2007 (14.0).\nThe 2007 version was released on September 12, 2006. 80 percent of the code was rewritten, with the goal of reducing high system resource utilization. A tabbed interface allows users to access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate windows open. Symantec also extended its Veritas VxMS technology, enhancing rootkit detection. VxMS allows Norton to detect inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. Phishing detection was introduced in this release for Internet Explorer. Norton checks sites visited in Internet Explorer against a blacklist and analyzes sites' code. Other features include a exploit scanner which looks at system components commonly hosting vulnerabilities, such as Internet Explorer settings. Supplementing the scanner, real-time exploit protection blocks attackers from leveraging common browser and application vulnerabilities. When possible, Norton will fix issues found; otherwise the user is warned of the vulnerability. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login.\nE-mail spam filtering, parental controls, advertisement blocking, and the information filtering features were not bundled with this release to reduce performance impact and disk space requirements. Instead, the features are available separately in 2007 add-on package.\nCNET reports mixed results in performance testing; however gains were made over the 2006 version. Warner also noted the 2007 version's reduced impact on system performance, compared to the 2006 version. Similar to the prior version, spam filtering module misidentified valid e-mail and missed actual spam, according to PC Magazine.\nWindows 2000 compatibility was dropped from this release. Compatibility with 32-bit editions of Windows Vista was introduced later in this release with a patch from Symantec. When installed in Vista, 350 MB of free space, an 800\u00a0MHz processor, and 512 MB of RAM is needed. When installed in Windows XP, 350 MB of free space, a 300\u00a0MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required.\nVersion 2008 (15.0).\nThe 2008 version was released on August 28, 2007. New features include SONAR and the Norton Identity Safe. SONAR was designed using technologies Symantec acquired from WholeSecurity. The Identity Safe supersedes the information filtering function, storing webform information and can fill such forms. The information filtering feature is still available in the 2008 add-on package, and can be used in conjunction with the Identity Safe.\n Phishing protection now integrates with Mozilla Firefox as well as Internet Explorer. The startup application manager was dropped from this release. Advertisement blocking was dropped from this release's add-on package.\nWhen installed in 32-bit editions of Windows XP Service Pack 2, 350 MB of free space, a 300\u00a0MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required. Support for 64-bit editions of Windows Vista was added in this release. 350 MB of free space, a 800\u00a0MHz processor, and 512 MB of RAM is required.\nVersion 2009 (16.0).\nThe 2009 version was released on September 8, 2008. Benchmarking conducted by PassMark Software highlights this release's 52 second install time, 32 second scan time, and 7 MB memory utilization. Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software.\nA single main interface replaces the tabs found in prior releases. New features include Norton Insight which whitelists files based on reputation, cutting scanning time. Virus signature updates are now delivered 5 to 15 minutes, supplementing the reliability tested updates issued by Symantec every several hours. However, such updates may incorrectly identify files as malicious, and users can elect not to receive those updates. Spam filtering was reintegrated in this release. The add-on package now includes information filtering and parental controls. The exploit scanner found in the 2007 and 2008 versions was dropped from this release.\nSystem requirements call for a 32-bit edition of Windows XP, a 300\u00a0MHz processor, 256 MB of RAM and 200 MB of free space. When installed in a 32 or 64-bit edition of Windows Vista, an 800\u00a0MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 200 MB of free space is required.\nNotable new features include the integration of Norton Safe Web, a web rating service. Safe Web blocks access to malicious sites. Additionally, search results from major search engine, such as Google, are color coded for safety (green for safe site, yellow for possibly unsafe site, red for dangerous sites, and gray with a white question mark for untested sites). The toolbar redirects queries to the Ask.com search engine, however does not share code with the Ask.com toolbar.\nMacintosh edition.\nVersion 1.0 through 3.0.\nNorton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was released November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the browser, parental controls, and the ability to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor.\nVersion 2.0 also ties in with the WHOIS database, allowing users to trace attacking computers. Users can inform network administrators of the attacking computers for corrective actions. When running under Mac OS 8.1 or 9, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under Mac OS X 10.1, a PowerPC G3 processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required.\nThe subsequent release, version 3.0, maintained the feature set found in version 2.0.

When running under OS 9.2, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under OS X 10.1.5 through 10.3, a PowerPC G3, 128 MB of RAM, and 150 MB of free space is required. However, version 3.0 is not compatible with OS X 10.4, or \"Tiger\".\nVersion 4.0.\nVersion 4.0 was released on December 18, 2008. Symantec also markets a bundle of Version 4.0 and the 2009 version for Windows, intended for users with both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installed. iClean was dropped from this release. The firewall now blocks access to malicious sites using a blacklist updated by Symantec. To prevent attackers from leveraging insecurities in the Mac or installed software, exploit protection was introduced in this release. Phishing protection was introduced in this release as well. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. Either a PowerPC or Intel Core processor, 256 MB of RAM and 150 MB of free space are required.\nReception.\nFBI cooperation.\nThe FBI confirmed the active development of Magic Lantern, a keylogger intended to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on 20 November 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press. The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, it installs a trojan horse on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting Magic Lantern. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.\nGraham Cluley, a technology consultant from Sophos, said \"We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn\u2019t know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party\". Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, \"Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools.\"\nFBI spokesman Paul Bresson, in response if Magic Lantern needed a court order to deploy, \"Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process.\" Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, unlike Carnivore, a predecessor to Magic Lantern, since physical access to a computer would require a court order.\nPerformance impact.\nIn 2006, Oli Warner published two articles comparing the system performance impact of various Windows applications, including Norton Internet Security 2006. He later reran the experiments, revising his methodology and included 2007 version at Symantec's request.\nWarner benchmarked the processor and the disk performance with and without each application, compiling two scripts in C++, a programming language. One calculated all prime numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 and the other tested file read/write time. BootVis was used to measure boot time. All testing was conducted inside a virtualized environment created by VMware. Despite the 2007 version's improvements, Warner noted its significant boot delay and impact on file operations.\nRecent testing conducted by PassMark Software found the 2009 version had the least impact on system performance. As noted earlier, Symantec funded the testing and provided some of the scripts used. Warner's scripts were also used to test file read/write time. The second and third ranked suites were ESET Smart Security 2008 and Kaspersky Internet Security 2009, respectively. Systems were benchmarked with a clean installation of Windows Vista, then again with a security suite installed. The 2009 version had the least impact on boot time, the fastest scan speed, lowest memory utilization, and the program itself installed the fastest out of its competitors. However, the 2009 version had the second most impact on file read/write time, as highlighted by Warner earlier.\nUninstallation.\nNorton Internet Security (Windows versions) have been criticized for refusing to uninstall completely, leaving unnecessary files behind. Versions prior to 2009 installed a separate LiveUpdate program, which updates Norton-branded software. The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton-branded products, if present. In response, Symantec developed the Norton Removal Tool to remove leftover registry keys and values along with files and folders. Uninstallation will not remove subscription data, preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies.\nWindows XP and Vista Service Packs.\nWhen Norton Internet Security 2008 is installed, users encountered incompatibilities upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users report numerous invalid registry keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters. Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility.\nDave Cole, Symantec's senior director of product management, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done \"extensive testing\" of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue had not surfaced. Cole essentially blamed Microsoft, \"This is related to XP SP3,\" he stated. Microsoft recommended users to contact Windows customer support. To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading. Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect. A tool to remove the added registry entries is also available from Symantec.\nWindows Vista.\nSarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's PatchGuard feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the kernel, a part of a operating system which interacts with the hardware. Rootkits often hide in an operating system's kernel, complicating removal. Mike Dalton, European president of McAfee said, \"The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous\", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, Windows Live OneCare. Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare. Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit. After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators, Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions."}

It is the 9th Disney animated movie and the fourth of the package movies the studio produced in the 1940s in order to save money during World War II. The Disney package movies of the late 1940s helped finance \"Cinderella\", and subsequent others, such as \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Peter Pan\".\nThe movie features two stories. The first story, \"Bongo\", is hosted by Jiminy Cricket and narrated by Dinah Shore. Based on the tale \"Little Bear Bongo\" by Sinclair Lewis, \"Bongo\" tells the story of a circus bear cub named Bongo who longs for freedom from captivity. Bongo escapes the circus and eventually forms a romantic relationship with a female bear cub named Lulubelle in the wild, realizing that he must prove himself in order to earn Lulubelle as his mate. The second story, \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\", is hosted by Edgar Bergen and is a retelling of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" featuring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy as three pheasants who discover the temperamental Willie the Giant's castle in the sky through the use of some magic beans. They must battle the greedy but lovable giant in order to restore peace to their valley. \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" was the last time Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse, because he was too busy on other projects to continue voicing the famous character. Disney replaced himself with sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.\nReception.\n\"Fun and Fancy Free\" received mostly positive reception. Rotten Tomatoes said that the movie has a 71% approval rating based on 7 reviews, with an average score of 6/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Though it doesn't quite live up to its title, \"Fun and Fancy Free\" has its moments, and it's a rare opportunity to see Mickey, Donald, and Goofy together.\"\nHome media.\n\"Fun and Fancy Free\" was first released on VHS in 1982.

{"id": "176458", "revid": "7843871", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176458", "title": "Hyperbolic geometry", "text": "In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry, meaning that the parallel postulate that defines Euclidean geometry isn't true. On a hyperbolic plane, lines that started out parallel will become further and further apart.\nReplacing this rule means that hyperbolic geometry acts differently from ordinary flat plane geometry. For example, triangles will have angles that add up to less than 180 degrees, meaning that they are too pointy and will look like the sides are sinking into the middle.\nMany real objects look like hyperbolic planes. For example, some types of coral and lettuce are shaped like pieces of hyperbolic planes. Other people say that it's easier to draw a map of the Internet when your map isn't flat, because there are a lot of computers around the edges but very few in the center. Some physicists even think our universe is a little bit hyperbolic.\nFormal definition.\nThe parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry says that in two dimensional space, for any given line \"l\" and point \"P\" not on \"l\", there is exactly one line through \"P\" that does not intersect \"l\". This line is called \"parallel\" to \"l\". In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two such lines through \"P\". As they do not intersect \"l\", the parallel postulate is false. Models have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry. These models prove that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid.\nBecause there is no hyperbolic analogue to Euclidean parallel lines, the hyperbolic use of \"parallel\" and related terms varies among writers. In this article, the two limiting lines are called \"asymptotic\" and lines that have a common perpendicular are called \"ultraparallel\"; the simple word \"parallel\" may apply to both.\nNon-intersecting lines.\nAn interesting property of hyperbolic geometry follows from the occurrence of more than one parallel line through a point \"P\": there are two classes of non-intersecting lines. Let \"B\" be the point on \"l\" such that the line \"PB\" is perpendicular to \"l\". Consider the line \"x\" through \"P\" such that \"x\" does not intersect \"l\", and the angle \u03b8 between \"PB\" and \"x\" counterclockwise from \"PB\" is as small as possible; i.e., any smaller angle will force the line to intersect \"l\". This is called an asymptotic line in hyperbolic geometry. Symmetrically, the line \"y\" that forms the same angle \u03b8 between \"PB\" and itself but clockwise from \"PB\" will also be asymptotic. \"x\" and \"y\" are the only two lines asymptotic to \"l\" through \"P\". All other lines through \"P\" not intersecting \"l\", with angles greater than \u03b8 with \"PB\", are called ultraparallel (or disjointly parallel) to \"l\". Notice that since there are an infinite number of possible angles between \u03b8 and 90 degrees, and each one will determine two lines through \"P\" and disjointly parallel to \"l\", there exist an infinite number of ultraparallel lines.\nThus we have this modified form of the parallel postulate: In hyperbolic geometry, given any line \"l\", and point \"P\" not on \"l\", there are exactly two lines through \"P\" which are asymptotic to \"l\", and infinitely many lines through \"P\" ultraparallel to \"l\".\nThe differences between these types of lines can also be looked at in the following way: the distance between asymptotic lines run to zero in one direction and grows without bound in the other; the distance between ultraparallel lines increases in both directions. The ultraparallel theorem states that there is a \"unique\" line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each of a given pair of ultraparallel lines.\nIn Euclidean geometry, the \"angle of parallelism\" is a constant; that is, any distance formula_1 between parallel lines yields an angle of parallelism equal to 90\u00b0. In hyperbolic geometry, the angle of parallelism varies with the formula_2 function. This function, described by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, produces a unique angle of parallelism for each distance formula_3. As the distance gets shorter, formula_2 approaches 90\u00b0, whereas with increasing distance formula_2 approaches 0\u00b0. Thus, as distances get smaller, the hyperbolic plane behaves more and more like Euclidean geometry. Indeed, on small scales compared to formula_6, where formula_7 is the (constant) Gaussian curvature of the plane, an observer would have a hard time determining whether he is in the Euclidean or the hyperbolic plane.\nHistory.\nFor centuries, geometers tried to prove the parallel postulate. They failed, but their efforts gave birth to hyperbolic geometry. The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam on quadrilaterals, were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had an influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Alfonso and John Wallis.\nIn the nineteenth century, hyperbolic geometry was explored by J\u00e1nos Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, after whom it sometimes is named. Lobachevsky published in 1830, while Bolyai independently discovered it and published in 1832. Karl Friedrich Gauss also studied hyperbolic geometry, describing in a 1824 letter to Taurinus that he had constructed it, but did not publish his work. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami provided models of it, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent if Euclidean geometry was.\nThe term \"hyperbolic geometry\" was introduced by Felix Klein in 1871. For more history, see article on non-Euclidean geometry.\nModels of the hyperbolic plane.\nThere are three models commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the Klein model, the Poincar\u00e9 disc model, and the Lorentz model, or hyperboloid model. These models define a real hyperbolic space which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry.\nDespite the naming, the two disc models and the half-plane model were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by Beltrami, not by Poincar\u00e9 or Klein.\nVisualizing hyperbolic geometry.\nM. C. Escher's famous prints \"Circle Limit III\" and \"Circle Limit IV\" \nillustrate the conformal disc model quite well. In both one can see the geodesics. (In \"III\" the white lines are not geodesics, but hypercycles, which run alongside them.) It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative curvature of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares.\nIn the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450\u00b0; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180\u00b0. Another visible property is exponential growth. In \"Circle Limit IV\", for example, one can see that the number of angels and demons within a distance of \"n\" from the center rises exponentially. The demons have equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius \"n\" must rise exponentially in \"n\".\nThere are several ways to physically realize a hyperbolic plane (or approximation thereof). A particularly well-known paper model based on the pseudosphere is due to William Thurston. The art of crochet has been used to demonstrate hyperbolic planes with the first being made by Daina Taimina. In 2000, Keith Henderson demonstrated a quick-to-make paper model dubbed the \"hyperbolic soccerball\"."}

Geometries which do not follow all of Euclid's axioms are called non-Euclidean geometry.\nHistory.\nSome mathematicians thought that Euclid's fifth postulate was much longer and more complicated than the other four postulates. \nMany of them thought that it could be proven from the other simpler axioms. Those who tried to do it included Omar Khayy\u00e1m, and later Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri, John Wallis, Lambert, and Legendre. Some mathematicians announced that they had proven the proposition from the simpler propositions, but they all turned out to be mistaken.\nPlayfair's axiom.\nAnother more recent proposition known as \"Playfair's axiom\" is similar to Euclid's fifth postulate. It says that:\n\"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you can only draw one straight line through this point that will not meet the other straight line.\"\nIn fact, mathematicians found out that this axiom is not only similar to Euclid's fifth postulate, but has exactly the same implications. Mathematically, the two propositions are called 'equivalent' propositions. Today Playfair's axiom is used more often by mathematicians than Euclid's original parallel postulate.\nNon-Euclidean geometry.\nEventually some mathematicians tried to build new geometries without using the axiom. One kind of Non-Euclidean geometry is called elliptic geometry. In elliptic geometry the parallel postulate is replaced by an axiom that states that:\n\"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you cannot draw a straight line through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line.\"\nMathematicians found that when they replaced Euclid's fifth postulate with this axiom, they were still able to prove many of Euclid's other theorems. One way to imagine elliptic geometry is by thinking of the surface of a globe. On a globe, lines of longitude appear to be parallel at the equator, but they all meet at the poles. Late in the 19th century, elliptic geometry was shown to be consistent. This proved that Euclid's fifth postulate was not independent of the other postulates. After this, mathematicians mostly stopped trying to prove the fifth postulate from the other four postulates. Instead, many mathematicians began studying other geometries that do not follow Euclid's fifth postulate.\nAnother axiom mathematicians sometimes replace Euclid's fifth axiom with says that:\n\"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you can draw at least two straight lines through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line.\"\nThis is called \"hyperbolic geometry\".\nAnother geometry simply removes Euclid's fifth postulate and does not replace it with anything. This is called \"neutral geometry\" or \"absolute geometry\"."}

They were predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. They were first directly detected on 14 September 2015.\nTo make gravity waves strong enough to be detected, something very massive must accelerate very fast. Sources of detectable gravitational waves include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. \nGravity and relativity.\nIn physics, gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that travel outward from the source. Albert Einstein predicted them in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. In theory, gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation. \nIn general relativity, gravitational waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light. They do not exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, in which physical interactions propagate at infinite speed. However, the detection of gravitational waves proves the last prediction of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\nIn 1993, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor binary star system that suggests gravitational waves are more than mathematical anomalies.\nCollision of neutron stars.\nGravitational waves have been detected from the collision and merging of two neutron stars. The first detection was on 17 August 2017 by a team in Pasadena, California.\nThe project is run by the LIGO Laboratory at Caltech. The detector is in the huge Livingston woodland in Louisiana. The detector is two two and a half mile (~4 km) long completely straight pipelines at right angles. Inside each pipe is a laser which measures any change in length. Once the gravity wave event was detected, telescopes searched for visual images of the cause. The VISTA telescope in Chile got the image.\nThe merging happened in a galaxy called NGC 4993. This is about 40 mega parsecs or 130 mega light years away in the direction of the Constellation Hydra. By comparison, the nearby Andromeda Galaxy is only 2.5 million light years from Earth.\nSuch events, as well as supernovas, are the sources of heavier elements such as gold and platinum."}

It is a comedy.\nPlot.\nOrsino, the Duke of lllyria, is in love with the Countess Olivia. She is not dating men for seven years because of the death of her brother, so she turns him down. Meanwhile, Viola was shipwrecked in Illyria but she has been rescued by a captain. She has lost her twin brother, Sebastian. She dresses herself as a boy and uses the name Cesario, so she can get work as a page for Orsino. As Orsino's page, Viola is sent to Olivia with love letters. Viola finds out, to her dismay, that Olivia has fallen for her (as a boy) rather than Duke Orsino. Also, Viola has already fallen in love with the Duke.\nSebastian (Viola's twin, thought to be dead) comes ashore in Illyria. He thinks Viola has drowned in the shipwreck. A man named Antonio has rescued him from the surf; at some risk to himself, because Antonio fought against the Duke at one time. Meanwhile, in Olivia's house, Sir Toby Belch (her cousin) has tricked Sir Andrew Aguecheek into supporting him, by convincing him that he could be a suitor for Olivia. So with the help of Maria, Olivia's maid, and Feste, a clown, Belch plots to make a fool of the steward. Maria writes a love letter to Malvolio that will make him think Olivia has fallen for him. Malvolio falls for the joke and dresses crazily as the letter says to. Not knowing it is a joke, the Countess is horrified and has Malvolio locked away as a madman. \nBelch tries to get Sir Andrew to fight a duel with Viola's \"Cesario\" character as she leaves but Olivia has a crush on Cesario. Viola and Sir Andrew prepare for a duel that neither one wants. Antonio intervenes to defend Cesario, because he thinks he is his friend Sebastian, and is arrested for piracy against Orsino. Olivia has become engaged to Sebastian. Viola still does not recognize Antonio. Later, Belch and Sir Andrew talk to Sebastian, who does not back down from Aguecheek when challenged and beats him in the duel. Meanwhile, Olivia has met and become engaged to Sebastian.\nAntonio is brought before the Duke for questioning, and Viola tells all about the duel. Antonio tells everyone how he dragged \"this man\" from the surf, saving his life. Then Olivia comes in, searching for her new husband, which she thinks is Viola. Adding to this confusion, Belch and Aguecheek enter claiming that Viola/Cesario has violently assaulted them. In the midst of Viola's denials, Sebastian shows up. The brother and sister recognize one another and are reunited. Sebastian helps to explain the confusion over who fought and married who. \nIn the end, Orsino and Viola are in love. Olivia and Sebastian are happily wed, and Olivia fusses at Belch and Maria for their abuse of Malvolio, who vows to get even. Belch agrees to wed Maria to make up for getting her in trouble. Everyone, except unhappy Malvolio, lives happily ever after. Orsino welcomes Olivia and Sebastian and he now realises he is attracted to Cesario. He promises to marry her as soon as she is dressed as a woman again."}

Like other animals in the macropod family, such as kangaroos and wallabies, the quokka eats grass and small plants, and is mainly nocturnal. It lives on some small islands off the coast of Western Australia, mainly on Rottnest Island near Perth, and Bald Island near Albany. A small number live on the main land in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay, which they share with Gilbert's Potoroo. The quokka is the only member of the genus \"Setonix\".\nDescription.\nThe quokka weighs between and . It is around long with a tail. This is short for a macropod. It has a solid build, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. It looks like a very small, fat kangaroo, but it can climb small trees and shrubs. It has rough fur which is a brown colour, fading to pale brown underneath. The quokka eats a small amount of its waste products.\nIt is about the size of a domestic cat.\nBehaviour.\nThe quokka is a social animal and lives in large groups. They eat grass, sedges, succulents and leaves. They can become very sick if fed with things like bread, given to them by visitors to Rottnest Island. Visitors are now told not to feed them. Quokkas breed at any time on the mainland, but in late summer on Rottnest. The female quokka has two babies (called \"joeys\") in a year. \nThe quokka moves in the same way as a kangaroo, using both small and large hops.\nQuokkas and people.\nQuokkas are not scared of people, so you are able to get quite close to them, particularly on Rottnest Island. It is against the law on Rottnest Island to handle or touch the animals in any way. A A$100 fine can be given by the Rottnest Island Authority for picking up a quokka. People can even be taken to court and get a fine of up to $1000. These fines have been used in some unusual cases where quokka have been hurt or killed by visitors to Rottnest.\nStatus.\nThere are a lot of quokkas living on the small offshore islands, because this is only a small area they are listed as vulnerable. On the mainland, they are attacked by dingoes, as well as introduced animals like foxes, dogs and cats. They also need thick ground cover for shelter. Farming has cleared much of the land which is another reason the species is threatened.\nEuropean discovery.\nThe quokka was one of the first Australian mammals seen by Europens. The Dutch sailor, Samuel Volckertzoon wrote about seeing a \"a wild cat\" on Rottnest Island in 1658. In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh thought they were rats and named the island \"Rottenest\", Dutch for \"rat nest\".\nName.\nThe word \"quokka\" is comes from a Nyungar word, which was probably \"gwaga\"."}

{"id": "176888", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176888", "title": "Three Gorges Dam", "text": "The Three Gorges Dam () is a dam in the Three Gorges region on the Yangtze River in Sandouping, in the country of China. Being one of the largest dams in the world, it also generates the biggest amount of hydroelectric power (22,250 megawatts), pushing the massive Itaipu Dam in Brazil from first place to second place. \nThe Three Gorges Dam project was completed on July 4, 2012. The dam was built for flood control, irrigation, and electricity. However, this has not come without problems. The dam covers a lot of historic sites and has caused 1.24 million people to lose their homes under the rising water. The dam forms the Three Gorges Reservoir, which extends nearly upstream to the city of Chongqing.\nHistory.\nThe dam was proposed by Sun Yat-sen, a Chinese political leader, in 1919. The site was surveyed in 1932 and 1939, by the Chinese and Japanese respectively. The Japanese drew up a plan (the Otani plan) for the dam, only to realize later that China would remain under Chinese control. Later, in 1944, the United States helped make plans for the dam, but all work on the dam stopped in 1947, because of the Chinese Civil War. In 1949, work resumed, but the work was slow because of problems in the economy. Later in 1958, some engineers who were against the dam were put in jail.\nIn 1980, work on the dam continued faster. The National People's Congress voted in 1992 for the dam. The dam was accepted by the government, and on December 14, 1994, construction began. In 2009, the dam began to make hydroelectricity. Some new plans, such as a set of 6 new power generators under construction, became operational in the year 2011. The reservoir filled to capacity at the end of 2008.\nDesign, cost and purpose.\nThe Three Gorges Dam consists of a main dam wall, and a section on the right with a set of five locks, which are devices used to raise boats and ships. \nThe dam cost $180 billion Chinese Yuan Renminbi (about $30 billion USD). While this cost seems huge, it actually was $20 billion yuan (about $3.3 billion USD) less than the original budget of $203.9 billion yuan (about $34 billion USD). However, this cost will be recovered when the dam makes money by making electricity. In about 10 years, the complete cost of the dam will be recovered.\nFlood control.\nOne of the big reasons the dam was built to control floods. It protects large cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai, which are very close to the river. Lots of farms, small villages and towns, and factories are also located near the river. In the event of a flood, there are 22 cubic kilometers (18 million acre feet) of space behind the dam to hold back the flood waters. The flood waters are stored behind the dam for future use. In the dry season, the water is released down the river, and the reservoir level drops to prepare for the next flood. However, the dam does not protect the lower river tributaries from flooding.\nNavigation.\nAnother reason the dam was built was for water navigation, or the transport of people and goods by ship. There are two sets of locks each of which has five stages. Each lock is long, wide, and deep, which is similar in size to the original locks of the Panama Canal, one of the biggest canals in the world. The reservoir behind the dam floods dangerous sections of the river, so boats and ships can go safely and easily. There is also a \"ship lift\" (an elevator for ships) that can lift ships that weigh up to 3,000 tons.\nElectricity.\nThe Three Gorges Dam generates 22,250 megawatts, which makes it the biggest single hydroelectric power source in the world. It has 34 electricity generators, and 32 are main generators. Each generator is powered by water that comes from the reservoir. Each of these 32 generators makes about 700 megawatts of electricity. (This is more electricity than the entire electricity generation of Glen Canyon Dam, one of the biggest dams in the United States.) The other two generators will make power for the dam itself. These two generators each make 50 megawatts.\nGenerators.\nOf the 32 main generators, 14 generators are on the north side of the dam. 12 are on the south side of the dam. 6 are in a separate powerhouse under a mountain just south of the dam. The generating capacity of the dam is 10,000 MWh (megawatt-hours), or the amount of megawatts generated per hour. Each main generator weighs a massive 6000 tons (about the same weight as three thousand cars). The water drops from the reservoir to the generator, which uses a type of turbine called a \"Francis turbine\". Each turbine is wide and tall. The amount of water that goes into the turbine can be from 1,968 cubic feet (600 m3) to 3,116 cubic feet (950 m3) per second. The turbines turn at a speed of 75 RPM (rotations per minute). The efficiency of the generators is from 94 to 96.5 percent.\nConstruction.\nThe 14 main generators on the north side were installed from 2003 to 2005. The first one to begin making electricity (Generator No.2) started on July 10, 2003. The last one (Generator No.9) started on September 7, 2005. The full power (9,800 megawatts) of the north side generators was first tested on October 18, 2006, when the reservoir had risen to above sea level. The 12 main generators on the south side were installed from 2007 to 2008. The first one to begin making electricity (Generator No.22) started on June 11, 2007. The last one (Generator No.23) started on August 19, 2008.\nElectricity production and distribution.\nFrom its completion to March 2009, the Three Gorges Dam has generated about 296,550,000 MWh (Megawatt-hours) of electricity. \nThree power lines send electricity away from the dam, to three electricity grids called the East, Central, and South China grids.\nThe dam provides about 3% of China's electricity. However, the dam was originally planned to supply 10% of China's electricity. The reason for the decrease is, China's energy use grew much faster than the designers expected.\nBenefits of the dam.\nBecause of reducing electricity needs on fossil fuels like coal and oil, the Three Gorges Dam has saved 31 million tons of coal per year, and prevented:\nThe dam has also benefited transportation on the river. Because of the locks (devices used to lift ships) installed on the dam, the benefits are:\nIn response to the dam, many sewage pipes that once dumped sewage straight into the Yangtze River now have to be treated. Over 65 percent of this waste water is now treated before flowing into the reservoir. There are now about 50 water treatment facilities in the area. Also, solid waste is now collected in 32 landfills. They can handle 7,664.5 tons of waste every day.\nThe dam also persuaded the government of China to think seriously about the pollution in the Yangtze River and the rest of China.\nDisadvantages of the dam.\nA total of 1.24 million people had to move to different places because their homes were flooded by the dam. This number is about 1.5% of the total population of Hubei Province (60.3 million) and Chongqing City (31.44\u00a0million) where the reservoir is located. 140,000 from Hubei Province alone. \nOn July 22, 2008, most of the people were safely relocated. 4 million more people will ultimately have to move to Chongqing from their homes near the Three Gorges Dam. \nWildlife habitat and historic sites.\nA large amount of animal habitat has also been destroyed. Many animals with critically low populations have lost their vital habitat. These include the endangered Siberian Crane, the Yangtze river dolphin (baiji), and Yangtze sturgeon. About one billion tons of dirty water flow into the Yangtze River each year. The dam has stopped this dirty water from being washed away to Shanghai, and led to serious pollution problems.\nAbout 1,300 historical sites have been flooded by the Three Gorges reservoir. Many of these historic sites have been moved to safer places. Some historic sites cannot be moved because of their location, size, or design.\nThe Three Gorges Dam will become much less spectacular, because the water level will rise up to in places, reducing the depth of the canyons. \nSediment problems.\nA lot of silt (sediment) that is carried by the river has been trapped in the reservoir. Eventually, if the dam is not removed, the reservoir will fill with silt, making it useless. Also, because the river's silt doesn't go downstream anymore, the city of Shanghai will suffer because there has been no silt to replace land that is washed away at the river's mouth. In a high-silt content river like the Yangtze, sediment can clog the dam's outlets, and it cannot release water. The water would back up behind the dam and have nowhere to go, and would eventually go over the dam, making it collapse.\nOther dangers.\nThe dam is also a possible target in war, weakening China's national security. It is also possible that the dam sits on a seismic fault.\nAssisting dam projects.\nGezhouba Dam.\nThe Gezhouba Dam (Gezhouba Water Control Project, Chinese: \u957f\u6c5f\u845b\u6d32\u575d\u6c34\u5229\u67a2\u7ebd\u5de5\u7a0b) is an afterbay (smaller dam in front) of the Three Gorges Dam. It forms a pool that extends upstream to the base of the Three Gorges Dam, improving navigation. The dam was built from December 30, 1970 to December 10, 1988. The dam is long and up to tall. It generates 2,710 megawatts of electricity. There are three ship locks at the dam. Lock No.2, which is long, wide, and deep, is among the 100 largest in the world.\nOther dams.\nA series of other dams are also planned upstream, on the Yangtze and Jinsha rivers. About four dams are planned on the stretch of the Yangtze River, and they will produce 38,500 megawatts in total. Eight dams are planned on the Jinsha River, and eight more upstream of it, and one original plan called for a dam in the Tiger Leaping Gorge, one of the deepest river canyons in the world. This plan was, however, scrapped in December 21, 2007, because of the gorge's status as a World Heritage site."}

The other form is haploid with only one set of chromosomes: the gametophyte. Both forms are multicellular.\nIn sexual reproduction, organisms have a haploid phase with one set of chromosomes and a diploid phase with two sets of chromosomes. In animals the body (soma) is usually diploid, while the haploid stage is only the gametes. \nIn eukaryotes an alternation of generations may occur. This means that both the diploid and the haploid phases are multi-cellular organisms. The classic example is the mosses, where the green plant is a haploid gametophyte, and the reproductive phase is the diploid sporophyte. The two forms often occur \"together\", as shown in the illustration on the right\nThe term \"alternation of generations\" refers only to the sexual cycle: organisms may have asexual reproduction as well. The term should not be confused with life cycle stages in animals, which may \"look\" very different, but where all cells have two sets of chromosomes.\nPlants.\nThe alternation of generations is an important concept in the evolution of plants. All land plants have alternation of generations.\nIn mosses and their relatives (Bryophytes), the haploid gametophyte is the dominant generation, and the diploid sporophytes are sporangium-bearing stalks growing from the gametophytes. In ferns, the diploid sporophyte is much larger, and the haploid gametophyte is a little plant that can grow for a long time.\nFor flowering plants (\"Angiosperms\"), the sporophyte generation is almost the whole life cycle (the green plant, roots etc.) except the small reproductive structures (pollen and ovule).\nThe sporophyte produces spores (hence the name), by meiosis. These develop into a gametophyte. Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid, meaning they have half as many chromosomes. Later, the mature gametophyte produces male or female gametes (or both) by mitosis. The fusion of male and female gametes (fertilization) produces a diploid zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This is the cycle which is known as alternation of generations or alternation of phases.\nAs a factor in plant evolution.\nIn the landmark work \"Variation and evolution in plants\", Stebbins discussed how alternation of generations related to the overall evolution of plants. He began:\nLater Stebbins comments:\nThe point is that, in diploids, new alleles are sheltered and (collectively) they are a reservoir of potential variation in the population.\nAlgae.\nMost algae have dominant gametophyte generations, but in some species the gametophytes and sporophytes are morphologically similar (isomorphic).\nBryophytes.\nBryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte stage on which the adult sporophyte is dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition. The sporophyte develops from the zygote inside the female sex organ, so its early development is nurtured by the gametophyte.\nVascular plants.\nAn independent sporophyte is the dominant form in all clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms (flowering plants) that have survived to the present day.\nEarlier evolution.\nEarly land plants had sporophytes that produced identical spores: they looked the same whichever sex they developed into. The ancestors of the gymnosperms evolved complex heterosporous life cycles: the spores producing male and female gametophytes were of different sizes. The female \"megaspores\" tending to be larger, and fewer in number, than the male \"microspores\".\nDuring the Devonian, several plant groups independently evolved \"heterospory\" and later \"endospory\", in which single megaspores were kept inside the sporangia of the parent sporophyte. These endosporic megaspores had a miniature multicellular female gametophyte with female sex organs and egg cells. The ova were fertilised by free-swimming sperm produced by windborne miniaturised male gametophytes in the form of pre-pollen.\nThe resulting zygote developed into the next sporophyte generation while still inside the single large female megaspore in the sporangium of the parent sporophyte. The evolution of heterospory and endospory was among the earliest steps in the evolution of seeds of the kind produced by gymnosperms and angiosperms.\nSimilar processes in other organisms.\nSome Chromalveolata, some fungi and some slime moulds have what seems to be genuine alternation of generations. These groups include such a wide range of different types that it is difficult to say how common the phenomenon is. Certainly slime moulds are not a monophyletic group, and that may be true of the other two groups,\nAnimals.\nAlternation of generations between a multicellular diploid and a multicellular haploid generation does not exist in animals.\nIn some animals, there is a life cycle with different diploid stages. This has sometimes mistakenly been called \"alternation of generations\", but is quite different from what happens in plants and some protists. The most common case is that there are two distinct generations, where only one has sexual reproduction. Animals where it has been found include the Cnidaria and the Tunicates. The images on the right show the case of jellyfish: The medusa looks different from the polyp; they are different phenotypes. Only the medusa reproduces sexually.\nOther animals with life cycle forms include parasites such as certain flukes, which live in different snails for one part of their life, and in vertebrates for another part.\nIn some cases, the cycle includes more than two generations. If this is the case, only one stage uses sexual reproduction. In aphids, for example, there is one generation that reproduces sexually, and up to forty that use parthenogenesis, a type of asexual reproduction."}

Gaunt was the third surviving son of Edward III and Philippa of Hainault. He was the father of Henry IV.\nGaunt was a younger brother of Edward, the Black Prince. He had great influence over the English throne during the childhood of his nephew, Richard II, and during the ensuing periods of political strife. He is not thought to have been an opponent of the king.\nJohn of Gaunt's legitimate male heirs, the Lancasters, included Kings Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI. His other legitimate children included, by his first wife Blanche, his daughters Philippa of Portugal and Elizabeth, Duchess of Exeter; and by his second wife Constance, his daughter Queen Catherine of Castile.\nJohn fathered five children outside marriage, one early in life by a lady-in-waiting to his mother, and four by Katherine Swynford, Gaunt's long-term mistress and third wife. These were surnamed Beaufort (after a former French possession of the Duke). The Beaufort children, three sons and a daughter, were legitimised by royal and papal decrees after John and Katherine married in 1396. Their half-brother Henry IV added a later proviso that they were barred from inheriting the throne.\nDescendants of this marriage included Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester and eventually cardinal; Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, grandmother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III; John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the great-grandfather of King Henry VII; and Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots, from whom are descended, beginning in 1437, all subsequent sovereigns of Scotland, and successively, from 1603 on, the sovereigns of England, of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the United Kingdom to the present day. The three succeeding houses of English sovereigns from 1399 \u2014 the Houses of Lancaster, York and Tudor \u2014 were descended from John through Henry Bolingbroke, Joan Beaufort and John Beaufort, respectively.\nLancaster's eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, was exiled for ten years by King Richard II in 1398 as resolution to a dispute between Hereford and Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.\nWhen John of Gaunt died in 1399, his estates and titles were declared forfeit to the crown as King Richard II named Hereford a traitor and commuted his sentence to exile for life. Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile to reclaim his inheritance and depose Richard. Bolingbroke then reigned as King Henry IV of England (1399\u20131413), the first of the descendants of John of Gaunt to hold the throne of England.\nDue to some generous land grants, John was not only one of the richest men in his era, but also one of the wealthiest men to have ever lived. Taking into account inflation rates, John was worth a modern equivalent of $110 billion, making him the sixteenth richest man in history."}

He thought that the words should be in German instead of Latin so that everybody would understand what they were singing about. Luther wrote the words of many chorales himself. He even composed some of melodies himself, such as \"Ein' feste Burg\" (\"A Mighty Fortress\"). Sometimes he used the traditional Gregorian Chant melodies from the Catholic worship and added new German words to it, for example \"Christ lag in Todesbanden\" (\"Christ lay in Death's Dark Bonds\").\nThe words of a chorale have a rhyming pattern. Most of the melodies have an AAB shape (the melody of the first part sung twice, then the second part). This shape is called \"Bar form\" in German.\nJohann Sebastian Bach used many chorale tunes, usually adding harmony of his own. He used these in his cantatas. Many of these chorales in four-part harmonies are sung as hymns today in German Protestant churches, and some of the tunes are used in English-speaking countries as well.\nChorale tunes also appear in chorale preludes, pieces for the organ. These would usually have been played during the church services before the chorale was sung.\nChorales were used by many later composers in their compositions, e.g. Felix Mendelssohn, Anton Bruckner and Max Reger."}

She was the mother of King Edward V of England. She was also the mother of Elizabeth of York, the queen consort of King Henry VII of England.\nElizabeth was born some time around the year 1437, at Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire. Her parents were Sir Richard Woodville and his wife, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, a foreign noblewoman who had first been married to the Duke of Bedford. After her first husband died, Jacquetta fell in love with Sir Richard, who was not very rich or important even though he was a knight. Jacquetta's friends and family felt that it was an unsuitable marriage and that he was not good enough for her. They had fourteen children altogether.\nWhen Elizabeth first met Edward, she was a widow. Elizabeth and her first husband, Lord Grey, had two sons, Thomas and Richard. Then Lord Grey was killed in battle, fighting on the opposite side to King Edward. Because she was a widow who already had children, and because her family had supported King Edward's enemies, she was thought to be an unsuitable wife for the king. Elizabeth and Edward were married in secret, because the king did not want to quarrel with his great friend the Earl of Warwick, who wanted Edward to marry a princess. At the time of their marriage, Edward was 22 and Elizabeth a few years older.\nWhen the Earl of Warwick discovered that the young king had married Elizabeth without his permission, he was furious. Although he was forced to accept the marriage, he became angry at the way Elizabeth's family grew powerful as a result of her becoming queen. A few years later, he turned against Edward and tried to put his rival, King Henry VI of England, back on the throne. While Edward was fighting to get his throne back, Elizabeth went to Westminster Abbey to find sanctuary; this meant that, because the abbey was a holy place, she could not be captured by her enemies as long as she remained there. While there, she gave birth to her first son, who was named Edward after his father. After a while, her husband returned and rescued her and her children, defeating the Earl of Warwick in battle and killing him.\nElizabeth and Edward had ten children altogether. Their eldest son, Edward, should have become king when his father died. However, King Edward died suddenly, and his own younger brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, snatched the throne. Richard hated the Woodville family, and killed Elizabeth's brother Anthony, who had been the guardian of her son Edward. Both Edward and Elizabeth's younger son, Richard, were placed in the Tower of London (which was then a royal palace). After a few months, they disappeared, and it was thought that King Richard had killed them. This rumour made the new king unpopular with many of his people, and two years later, Henry Tudor took the throne from him in battle and became King Henry VII of England. Henry VII married Elizabeth's eldest daughter, who was also called Elizabeth. Elizabeth Woodville herself died a few years later at Bermondsey Abbey."}

The bridge was designed by architect Richard Gilbert Scott.\nRepairs.\nEven though the bridge was built so recently, it has had some serious repairs done. A report into the failure of nine heavy-duty nuts on the Forth Road Bridge said all 1,888 similar nuts on the crossing should be replaced.\nAll the cable band nuts and bolts were replaced in the late 1990s as part of a large project to replace the hanger ropes. Ten years later, a report found serious defects. Bridge authority FETA investigated when inspectors found the nine cracked nuts. Engineers FaberMaunsell carried out lab tests and a study of similar issues on suspension bridges across the world. The nuts are used to secure 192 'cable bands' to the bridge's main cables.\nThe report also found workmen had not placed washers correctly. This may have led to uneven pressure on the nuts. The protective coating on the nuts was poor, and allowed moisture to cause damage.\nEngineers have now replaced all nuts and bolts which were cracked."}

It is in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The stadium opened in April 2009. It replaced the original Yankee Stadium, which the Yankees had played in since 1923. It was opened with an exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs on April 3, 2009. The first regular game was played on April 16, 2009.\nThe new stadium cost $1.5 billion dollars to build. It was the most expensive baseball stadium in the world. It is built to look like the old Yankee Stadium. It has many new and more modern features.\nStadium parts.\nThe new stadium has many parts that look similar to the old one when it was first built. This includes the outside walls of the stadium, the color of the seats, and the size of the playing field being the same.\nThe new stadium has an area known as \"Monument Park\" behind the center field wall. Monument Park has monuments honoring good Yankee players from past years. Monument Park is open before the game starts.\nAnother feature is the Great Hall. The Great Hall is a hallway near the entrance of the stadium with a tall roof and many stores and food stands. It also has banners to celebrate the team's history.\nThe new stadium has more than three times as many suites as the original. A suite is a fancy room with a view of the field where rich people watch the game. There are also many bars and clubs. It has better food than the original stadium.\nTransport.\nPeople can drive to the stadium. There are several garages near it. It is near the New York Thruway in the Bronx. The stadium can also be reached by train, because there is a subway station near it. Trains can often be seen from the stadium.\nReception.\nThe stadium is generally seen as being better than its predecessor, but some people dislike it. This mainly because the stadium's high cost has led to very high ticket prices. The high prices meant that there were many empty seats when the stadium first opened, especially behind the batter where tickets can cost up to 2,500 dollars. People have also disliked the stadium for its fan unfriendly practices. For example, fans cannot get autographs from players before the game. The stadium was seen as too expensive for being only a little better than the original. The new stadium also allowed many home runs during its first month, because of the way the wind moves the ball. That made many people call it \"too easy\"."}

Citi Field is sponsored by Citi Bank. Construction began in 2006 when the Mets home was still Shea stadium. It replaced Shea Stadium, which was torn down after the 2008 baseball season. The place where the old stadium stood is a parking lot now. The 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Citi Field.\nHistory.\nIdeas to build a new ball park in Queens were first discussed in the 1990s. This happened because the Met's then current stadium, Shea Stadium, was growing older and did not have many features found in newer stadiums. The Mets, along with the City of New York made plans to build a new stadium, next to Shea. The project to build the stadium was approved in March 2006, and construction started soon after. The building of the stadium could be seen from Shea, during the 2007 and 2008 baseball season. The new stadium, named Citi Field opened on April 13, 2009.\nStadium features.\nCiti Field has many interesting and unique attractions. The park has seats for up to 41,000 fans to watch a game. The seats are painted green to look similar to the Polo Grounds- another New York stadium torn down in 1965. Citi Field has a home run Apple in center field. The Apple is not a real apple, rather it is a large plastic apple with the Mets sign on it that rises when a Mets player hits a home run. This is similar to Shea stadium, which also had a home run apple. The foul poles at the stadium are painted orange.\nAnother part of the stadium is the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. This is the place where most fans enter the stadium, and teaches fans about Jackie Robinson, the first black player in Major League Baseball. Citi Field also has an area called the Pepsi Porch. It is a place where fans can watch the game in the outfield. The first two rows of the porch are over the playing field.\nThere is also a smaller field behind the centerfield wall where kids can play baseball and other games. The stadium also has a museum to show Mets history and many restaurants, bars, stores, and food stands which surround the field. \nTransport.\nCiti Field has many big parking lots which surround the stadium, allowing fans to bring their car to the game. The Stadium also has a train station with the New York City Subway and Long Island railroad that goes to downtown New York City.\nChanges.\nIn the years after it opened, the stadium had a few changes. After the 2011 baseball season, the outfield fences were moved closer to the batter, because people thought it was too hard to hit home runs. The fences were also painted blue and orange."}

It is a helium nucleus: that is a helium atom without electrons. Radioactive elements give out alpha particles when they go through a kind of radioactive decay, known as alpha decay.\nDuring alpha decay, the atomic nucleus releases an alpha particle. The nucleus will lose two protons and two neutrons when this happens. After the decay, the atom will change to another element, because the atom loses two protons. For example, when americium goes through alpha decay it changes into neptunium because neptunium is defined to have two protons less than americium. Alpha decay usually happens in heavy elements, those containing more neutrons and protons, such as uranium, thorium, plutonium, and radium.\nAlpha particles cannot even go through a few centimetres of air. Alpha radiation cannot hurt humans when the alpha source is outside the human body, because human skin does not let the alpha particles go through, it cannot \"penetrate\" it. Alpha radiation can be very harmful if the source is inside the body, such as when people breathe dust or gas containing materials which decay by emitting alpha particles.\nTo look at americium again, the isotope americium-241 gives off alpha radiation. This radiation can be very harmful if it is inside someone's body because it can change the DNA in the cells. But it is not harmful when it is outside of the body because alpha radiation does not travel through the outside layers of the skin very well.\nWhen scientists write equations about nuclear reactions they use the Greek letter Alpha. Ernest Rutherford started this when he discovered and named three kinds of ionizing radiation. "}

It can also mean the device (e.g. a metal stamp or ring) which is used to make the official mark.\nThe word comes from the Latin \u201csigillum\u201d.\nThe study of seals is called Sigillography.\nImpression.\nSeals are used on documents to prove that they really did come from the person who signed it (they \u201cauthenticate\u201d the document). A seal could be put on the letter itself, or on the envelope where it is stuck down. The writer would pour some wax over the joint of the letter, then press a ring or metal stamp (called a matrix) which has his official mark on. This meant that no one would be able to open the letter and then close it again, because the seal will break when the letter is opened. Most governments still put seals on important documents. Letters do not normally have seals any more, even important letters.\nSometimes lead, pewter or ivory were used instead of wax.\nEach seal is different from any other. This means that an important person (e.g. a king) has his own personalized stamp. \nHistory of seals.\nSeals were used in very early civilizations. In ancient Mesopotamia seals were engraved on cylinders, which could be rolled to create an impression on clay. Signet-rings of kings from Ancient Egypt have been found. From Ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet-rings of kings have been found. Other ancient seals come from Saudi Arabia or the Ancient Greek and Roman times. \nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 seals were not used so much. The Popes used lead seals, and Charlemagne (who died in 814) had a special seal engraved with Jupiter Sarpis. In England all the kings from Edward the Confessor onwards had their own \u201cseal of majesty\u201d.\nSeals from East Asian later developed into block printing. Seals from China have been found from the 5th century B.C.\nThe wearing of signet rings (from Latin \"signum\" meaning sign) is an old tradition among nobles in European and some other cultures. In Latin America, it is also traditional for the descendants of the old \"criollo\" aristocratic families to wear signet rings in the Spanish tradition.\nSignet rings were often worn on the little finger of either the right or left hand (depending on the country), although some countries have different customs (French and German noblemen, and some Spanish nobles wear it on the ring finger of their left hand; Swiss wear it on the ring finger of their right hand). In the United Kingdom, signet rings are typically worn on the little finger of the left hand of the bearer and are often cast of gold. The ring is worn with the seal facing outwards so that the wearer can make a seal without taking the ring off.\nA similar tradition is found with blacksmiths who use their \u201ctouchmark\u201d (a stamp used on the hot metal to show who made it) on whatever they made. When they died their touchmark was destroyed.\nThe study of seals (sigillography) is very useful in many areas: genealogy, political history, art history etc. This is because modern science can work out very closely how old a seal is. This makes it possible to date documents or works of art.\nMetaphorical uses of \u201cseal\u201d.\nThe word \u201cseal\u201d is often used as a metaphor: \nBecause seals are used to close something officially, the word \u201cseal\u201d can also be used in other situations with a similar meaning:"}

He did this in an experiment using dogs. Pavlov noticed that the dogs naturally salivated when they saw food. This behaviour did not need to be taught. In this example, the food is an \"unconditioned\" stimulus. He paired this unconditioned stimulus (showing food to the dogs) with another, \"neutral\" stimulus: the ringing of a bell. Pavlov discovered that, if the two stimuli are presented together again and again, the organism \"learns\" that they belong together. As a result, it is enough to show the neutral stimulus to get a conditioned response or reflex.\nClassical conditioning is an important factor in everyday life. It can be applied in many areas such as behavioural therapies, responses to drugs and in modern day marketing strategies.\nClassical conditioning is different from operant conditioning. Operant conditioning is a different kind of learning. It happens when an individual or animal learns a behaviour as a result of a consequence of that behaviour. For example, a child may learn to open a box to get some sweets. So, when a behaviour has a good result, the organism learns to associate the behaviour with this good result. As such, learning the behaviour and repeating it. \nSo, operant conditioning explains voluntary changes in behaviour. Classical conditioning explains how reflexes are trained.\nApplications.\nBehavioural therapies.\nThe same learning process that develops a conditioned response can be used to teach a new behaviour or change old ones. Some mental health therapies are often linked to classical conditioning. \nAversion therapy aims to stop a harmful behaviour by replacing a positive response with a negative one. This makes a person associate the harmful behaviour with a bad feeling. For example, a doctor can give a person a medicine that makes them sick (unwell) if they drink alcohol. This person will learn to associate the drinking of alcohol with feeling ill. \nSystematic desensitisation is often used to treat phobias and other anxiety disorders. The person is exposed to what they fear or what causes them to feel anxious. The therapy aims to condition a response of relaxation instead. This is a form of counterconditioning. In time, the feared stimulus produces a conditioned response of relaxation. \nFlooding is similar to desensitisation. This therapy directly exposes the person to their phobias and anxieties. For example, a person who is claustrophobic is locked in a small room for some time. This aims to expose the person to their feared thing in a safe environment and help them overcome their fears.\nConditioned drug response.\nThere are two kinds of conditioned drug responses. \nFirst, a drug user may become more tolerant to a drug if it is taken in similar surroundings (a similar setting) every time. This is because the familiar setting will bring about a compensatory response. As a result, taking the drug in similar settings will help your body tolerate the drug. Alternatively, taking the drug outside of the regular setting will make it harder (more difficult) for your body to manage its effects. For this reason, overdose is more common when a user takes a drug in a new setting. \nIn other cases, the opposite may happen. If a stimulus is present every time a drug is taken, the stimulus alone may produce a conditioned physiological response the same as the effect of the drug. For example, people who drink lots of coffee may experience the feeling of being alert (wide awake) from the \"smell\" of coffee. So, without drinking coffee, they experience the same effects from only the smell.\nModern culture.\nClassical conditioning theory is used in the modern day to elicit a certain response. A common example is its use in advertising. Advertisers will attempt to make consumers associate their product with a good feeling or response. For example, beauty adverts will use models with clear skin to advertise their products. This will make people associate the product with smooth, healthy skin.\nOther examples of strategies used to make a positive advertisement are using happy music, good-looking models and cute animals and babies."}

His father was from Moravia, his mother was Hungarian. As a child he showed exceptional musical talent. He learned the piano and the violin and studied at the Vienna Conservatory, where he won prizes for composition and for playing the violin and piano. He was playing the violin in the orchestra when Richard Wagner conducted a concert in Bayreuth to celebrate the beginning of the building of his new theatre: the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. He joined the Vienna Court Orchestra where he played in concerts that were conducted by famous composers such as Brahms, Liszt, Verdi and Wagner. Soon he started his career as conductor in Leipzig. He quickly became internationally famous. In 1889 he was invited to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He conducted many concerts in the USA. In 1893 he became conductor of the Budapest Opera. Two years later he also became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, taking the place of Carl Reinecke. In the same year he also became the main conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. He remained conductor of these two world famous orchestras until his death.\nNikisch gave concerts all over the world, appearing as guest conductor with great orchestras such as the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1912 he took the London Symphony Orchestra to the USA, the first European Orchestra to tour there (fortunately they cancelled their booking on the RMS Titanic at the last moment). He conducted at the Leipzig Opera and taught conducting at the Leipzig Conservatory.\nNikisch was famous for his conducting of the great Romantic composers such as Schumann, Brahms, Bruckner, Tchaikovsky and Wagner as well as Beethoven. He had a great influence on the next generation of conductors including Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Sir Adrian Boult. He helped composers such as Mahler, Max Reger and Richard Strauss to become famous by performing their music.\nNikisch married the singer Am\u00e9lie Heusner.

It was placed at a dangerous Illinois Central railroad crossing on Mississippi State Route 7 in Grenada, Mississippi.\nIt was put up in the mid-1930s by inventor Alonzo Billups. Mr. Billups and the railroad were worried; the crossing had many accidents between trains and motor vehicles. He wanted drivers who were going to cross the tracks to know that a train was coming and he wanted to do it in a very big way. The Billups signal was built like a giant steel gantry which went up and over the entire highway. This is similar to crossing signals used today in North America; Mr. Billups' signal may have been the very first time such a signal was built. A pair of flashing red lights similar to those used today topped giant neon signs on either side of the big gantry. The signs lit up with the words \"Stop-DEATH-Stop\" along with a neon skull and crossbones. Flashing neon arrows pointed toward the train to tell drivers which way the train was coming. The Billups Neon Crossing Signal even had a special way of warning drivers with sound. Instead of the electric or electronic bells used now, this signal used a very loud air raid siren.\nAfter World War II started, neon became hard to get. The signal had electrical problems as well. Often, the air raid siren would go off even if no train was coming and it wouldn't shut off until the railroad sent a repair crew. No more of these special signals were ever built and the only one ever built was taken down after less than twenty years."}

They believe in spiritual pluralism - that people are free to decide what they believe and how they use it in their lives. They pick and mix what they believe with bits taken from both eastern and western culture and religions. They make their own decisions about what God is and how they worship God, if they even believe in God at all. New Age people often meditate, sometimes to seek their own contact with God.\nThere are many authors who describe how they see the New Age in their books. There is also New Age music which tends to be calm and relaxing.\nNew Age persons believe that a new future time is coming in which people will be more aware of their own special spiritual nature and this will make the world a different and better place.\nHistory.\nThe New Age grew out of a Christian sect that contained a book now titled \"The Lord Of The Rings\" as its holy text. Written by Raven Mew of Glastonbury, Pope Sylvester II canonized the book as the holy text of the religion named the New Age, being Gaelic for \"eternity\" and New Age persons called \"Dannon\" (singular, \"Danu\").\nIn 2001, 70 million Americans converted to the New Age and a massive movement began to fall as the third-largest world religion with 1.3 billion by 2021.\nBeliefs.\nThe Sun-Moon is the symbol of the New Age. Reincarnations are done when one breaks the Sacred Laws -- due to all being God and Gaia as Goddess -- and thus reincarnated by sin. To break the cycle, one must be Raptured. This means the Danu must be challenged by an Ancient, a spirit who lasted thousands of years to act as guides and teachers.\nHolidays.\nYule, the Winter Festival, from Winter Solstice to December 30, is celebrated to mark the transition from childhood to adulthood. Lilith, the summer festival, from Summer Solstice to June 30, is celebrated to mark the transition from life to death.\nImbolc (Feb. 2) celebrates the founding of the New Age. May Day (May 1) celebrates Raven Mew's birth. Lammas (Aug. 31) is the Day of the Harvest. Samhain is the sacred month of fasting ended by Halloween to honor Raven Mew's death. The first time was when 120-year-old Raven Mew requested to be cremated saying her ashes would mean death. The cremation took 30 days, hence the fasting.\nIssues.\nOne issue that concerns most Dannon is the authenticity of the faith by others outside the faith, especially when the terms \"New Ager\" and \"New Age people are characterized. The belief that the New Age is not a religion has been debunked many times beforehand. The notion of \"new-age religion\" as Satan's most recent attack has resulted in psychiatric hospital commitment.\nMore recently, as climate change and abortion bans became a complete challenge, most Dannon feel that individual rights are simply manifestations of larger problems. In 2015, Shirley MacLaine's \"What If?\" stirred concern in both inner and outer circles when referring to Jews \"working out their karma during the Holocaust from previous lives pertaining to terrible persecution done by them as Christians during the Crusades.\"\nMost Dannon point out that the New Age is \"not\" a new religious movement since it lasted over a thousand years being older than Sikhism and Baha'i. Some critics call it an umbrella term of ideas and concepts oriented to higher consciousness only to be debunked by religious experts. "}

The plane was on a commercial flight with 155 people on board and had left LaGuardia Airport six minutes earlier, but it had to land after a flock of birds hit its engines. The event was remarkable because no one died. Because of this, the event was called the Miracle on the Hudson. In 2016 a film was made recreating the crash. The film is named \"Sully\", after the plane's main pilot Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger.\nThe plane took off from LaGuardia Airport at 3:26 pm. It was going to fly to Charlotte, North Carolina, and then it would fly onwards to Seattle, Washington state. Two minutes after the plane left the ground, it flew into a flock of Canada geese. Some of the geese were sucked into the plane's two engines. Both engines stopped working. The pilots, Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles, realized that they needed to land the plane as soon as possible. They thought about heading back to LaGuardia Airport or trying to land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. They decided that they could not land at an airport and instead they would have to land the plane in the river. This was also dangerous for two reasons. Firstly, the plane would break apart if it hit the water too quickly or if it hit something else. Secondly, the passengers would drown if they were not rescued quickly, as it would be hard to swim in the cold river.\nThe pilots landed the plane in the river at 3:31 pm. The plane started to slowly fill with water and sink. The passengers climbed out onto the wings and life rafts of the plane. Sullenberger had landed the plane near some boats, and the first boats reached the plane a few minutes after the landing. The boats rescued the passengers and crew. By 3:55 pm, everyone had been rescued. They were taken to both sides of the river. 24 passengers and two rescuers had to go to a hospital, but most of them left the hospitals before the end of the day.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board investigated the event. In May 2010, they released a report which said that Sullenberger had made the right decision. The plane is now on display in the Carolinas Aviation Museum in Charlotte."}

{"id": "177546", "revid": "983938", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177546", "title": "Otto Klemperer", "text": "Otto Klemperer (born Breslau, 14 May 1885; died Z\u00fcrich, 6 July 1973) was a German-born conductor and composer. He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century.\nEarly life.\nKlemperer was born in Breslau, Silesia, which was then in Germany, but is now called Wroc\u0142aw in Poland. He was born into a Jewish family. He studied music at the Conservatory in Frankfurt am Main, and then went to Berlin where he studied conducting and composition with Hans Pfitzner. In 1905 he met Gustav Mahler who was very impressed with him. \nCareer.\nHe recommended him for the job of conductor at the German Opera in Prague. He soon got jobs in other places: Hamburg, Barmen, Strasbourg, Cologne and Wiesbaden. He was offered a job at the Berlin Staatsoper, but he did not want it because he thought he would not be able to do things there the way he wanted. However, four years later, in 1927, he took a job with a special branch of the Staatsoper which had been started in order to perform new music in modern (non-traditional) performances. They played in the Kroll Theatre. Klemperer became very famous for the performances that he conducted there.\nThe Kroll Theatre had been started by politicians who supported the Weimar Republic. They wanted opera to be different from the traditional operas that were performed in the Theatre Unter den Linden supported by the monarchy. The operas that Klemperer conducted there included Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek's \"From the House of the Dead\", Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg's \"Erwartung\", Igor Stravinsky's \"Oedipus Rex\", and Paul Hindemith's \"Cardillac\".\nBy 1931 the political situation had changed and the Kroll Opera was shut down. By 1933 the Nazis had gained power and Klemperer left Germany and went to the United States where he took U.S. nationality. He became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (1933-39) and also conducted the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Pittsburg Orchestra. However he was not happy in the United States where the musical culture and music critics were largely out of sympathy with his Weimar modernism and he felt he was not properly valued. He hoped for a permanent position as lead conductor in New York or Philadelphia. But in 1936 he was passed over in both - first in Philadelphia, where Eugene Ormandy succeeded Stokowski at the Philadelphia Orchestra, and then in New York, where Toscanini's departure left a vacancy at the New York Philharmonic but John Barbirolli and Artur Rodzinski were engaged in preference to Klemperer. The New York decision was particularly galling, as Klemperer had been engaged to conduct the first fourteen weeks of the New York Philharmonic's 1935-6 season. Klemperer's bitterness at this decision was voiced in a letter he wrote to Arthur Judson, who ran the orchestra: \"that the society did not re-engage me is the strongest offense, the sharpest insult to me as artist, which I can imagine. You see, I am no youngster. I have a name and a good name. One could not use me in a most difficult season and then expel me. This non-reengagement will have very bad results not only for me in New York but in the whole world... This non-reengagement is an absolutely unjustified wrong done to me by the Philharmonic Society.\"\nIn 1939 he had a serious illness and was operated on for a brain tumour. For some time he was not well enough to work. Then from 1947 to 1950 he returned to Europe to conduct the Budapest Opera. In the early 1950s Klemperer experienced difficulties arising from his U.S. citizenship. American union policies made it difficult for him to record in Europe, while his left wing views made him increasingly unpopular with the State Department and FBI. In 1952 the United States refused to renew his passport.\nIn 1954 Klemperer again returned to Europe, becoming conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in London. He took German nationality. By this time Furtw\u00e4ngler was dead and Toscanini had retired, so Klemperer was thought of as the greatest conductor of German music. He was given a recording contract by EMI. His concerts and many recordings with the Philharmonia brought him world-wide recognition. He lived in Switzerland but spent much time in London conducting.\nKlemperer became an Israeli citizen in 1970. He retired from conducting in 1971 and died in Z\u00fcrich in 1973, aged 88.\nPersonal life.\nKlemperer\u2019s performances that we have on record show us that he was a musician who understood the shape of a musical work perfectly. He often chose slow speeds, but the music could sound very heroic. His health problems included manic depression which made him sometimes very difficult to work with. He also had a bad fall in Montreal. From then onwards he always had to sit down to conduct. He also burnt himself badly because he was smoking in bed, and he tried to put out the flames with a glass of whisky which made the fire worse.\nKlemperer is less well known as a composer, but he wrote a number of works, although he hardly ever performed them and most of them are now forgotten."}

In five attacks, they released sarin on several lines of the Tokyo subway. This killed thirteen people, and severely injured fifty. It caused temporary vision problems for nearly a thousand others. \nAfter the event, the movement renamed itself \"Aleph\". Aum Shinrikyo had been formally designated a terrorist organization by several entities, including Canada, and the United States. \nOn 10 October 1995, Aum Shinrikyo was ordered to be stripped of its official status as a \"religious legal entity\" and was declared bankrupt in early 1996. However the group continues to operate under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. It is funded by a successful computer business and donations, and is kept under strict surveillance. Attempts to ban the group altogether under the 1952 Subversive Activities Prevention Law were rejected by the Public Security Examination Commission in January 1997.\nIn April 2011 the Public Security Intelligence Agency stated that Aum currently had about 1,500 members. At the end of July 2011 the cult reported its membership as 1,030.

Woodstock is 128\u00a0km southwest of Toronto, north of Highway 401 (Ontario) along the historic Thames River (Ontario). It is known as the Dairy Capital of Canada and promotes itself as \"The Friendly City.\" In 2006, 35,480 people lived in Woodstock.\nThe community was first settled in 1800 after it was determined by Sir John Graves Simcoe, governor of what was then known as Upper Canada, that the area would make a good townsite. The early settlers were American immigrants from New York state. Increased immigration from Great Britain followed in the 1820s and 1830s. Woodstock was incorporated as a town in 1851 and a city in 1901.\nVansittart Avenue (named after Admiral Henry Vansittart, an early settler) in Woodstock's west end has one of the finest residential Victorian streetscapes in the province. Woodstock has a community center that hosts hockey games in addition to many social gatherings.\nGovernment.\nThe city government, Woodstock City Council, consists of four city councillors and two city and county councillors. Trevor Birtch is the current mayor, following a hard fought and demanding campaign. Oxford Centre is the district in which Woodstock is included when voting in federal elections. Currently, the MP of Oxford is Dave MacKenzie (of the Conservative party).\nHistory.\nDevastating tornado.\nOn August 7, 1979, the Woodstock area was hit by three tornadoes, two of which registered at least F4 on the Fujita Scale. On the west side of town along Ingersoll Road, a Dominion Food Store was heavily damaged while the tornadoes skipped over every other home and business. Dickson's Florist was wiped out and the Fry home was moved on its foundation. Father Grondziel of the new Polish Roman Catholic Church, next to the Dominion Food Store, had just stepped into the washroom when one of the tornadoes passed by and took off the roof of the church and everything in the room he had just been in. No one on the street was injured and the cleanup took many weeks. On the south side, the buildings of the Maranatha Christian Reformed Church and the John Knox Christian School were destroyed, and the only fatality occurred when a vehicle on Highway 401 was blown off the road and the lone occupant killed.\nLandmarks.\nOld St. Paul's Anglican Church.\nOne of Woodstock's most notable historic sites is Old St. Paul's Church, the mother church of the Anglican Communion in Oxford County. The church was built in 1834. It is near the intersection of Huron and Dundas Streets. It used as a temporary jail during the rebellion of 1837. The church is a beautiful, brick cruciform structure surrounded by Woodstock's oldest cemetery. It has original box pews and dozens of memorial tablets commemorating prominent Woodstock citizens.\nSpringbank Snow Countess.\nThe \"Springbank Snow Countess\" was commemorated by a life-size statue (designed by acclaimed Oxford County agricultural artist Ross Butler) which is on the corner of Dundas and Springbank.\nThis bell iron and lead statue was made to honour a record-setting milk production by a Holstein (Friesian) cow named Snow Countess.\nThe statue was first unveiled on August 4, 1937 by the Holstein Frisian Association of Canada. Snow Countess was born on November 18, 1919 and died at age 16 on August 9, 1936. During her lifetime, she produced 9,062 pounds of butterfat, impressive at the time. The statue and granite base cost $4,000 to design and erect.\nThe cow has become an important symbol to Woodstock and is used in many cultural events, such as the annual Cowapalooza Festival.\nInfrastructure.\nPittock Dam.\nConstruction was started on the dam in 1964 and officially completed in 1967. The cost of the dam and land base at that time was close to $6 million. Present annual maintenance costs are about $40,000.\nThe Pittock Dam is designed for both flood control and flow augmentation purposes. It is designed to benefit water quality downstream during dry summer conditions and provide year round flood control capability to protect downstream communities.\nWoodstock Airport.\nThe Woodstock Airport is 2.5 nautical miles (4.6\u00a0km) west of Woodstock.\nIndustry.\nToyota Plant.\nIn June 2005, Toyota, the world's second largest automaker, announced plans to build a new, $800 million automobile assembly plant in Woodstock on a 1,000-acre (4\u00a0km\u00b2) undeveloped undeveloped site in the city's northeast end. The plant was expected to employ 2000 people and begin full production of the Toyota RAV4 SUV in November 2008, at the rate of 150,000 a year. However, due to the recent economic problems and the slowing car sales, Toyota announced that production would be cut by 50% to 75,000 a year and the work force shrunk 40% to 1200 people. Fortunately the other 800 workers are expected to be recalled when car sales increase. It was the first new auto assembly plant to be built in Canada in two decades.\nLate in 2008, the plant began producing vehicles, and on December 4, a ceremony attended by Ontario and federal government representatives as well as top Toyota executives, took place to celebrate its official opening.\nHino Motor Sales Canada.\nEarly in March 2006, Hino Motors, a Toyota Motor Co. subsidiary, announced that it will be the first Japanese truck manufacturer to build its vehicles in Canada with a new Woodstock plant slated to begin production in April 2006, in the former General Seating plant in the Pattullo Ridge Business Park near Highway 401 and Highway 59.\nThe $3 million, 120,000 square foot (11,000 m\u00b2) plant will employ 45 and assemble 2,000 trucks a year when it begins production.\nIn late November 2008 the Hino Motors automotive plant was completed.\nOther Major Industries in Woodstock include:\nVuteq Canada Inc (automotive parts supplier)\nFirestone Textiles\nCBM (Concrete)\nToyota Boshuko\nGeneral Motors (national parts distribution center)\nRWF Braun (Heavy Equipment)\nStandard Tube\nWoodstock Organ Company.\nA major Canadian piano and organ and reed organ company operated under the name of Woodstock Organ Company for many years of the early twentieth century. It was owned by D W Karn, who was at one time mayor of Woodstock. Karn had previously operated an organ and piano manufacturing company under his own name.\nMedia.\nWoodstock has one daily newspaper owned by Sun Media Corporation, the \"Woodstock Sentinel-Review\".\nThere are three licensed FM radio stations: \nThe city also has a rebroadcaster of Toronto television station Citytv, operating on channel 31 and primarily targeting London and surrounding towns.\nTransportation.\nIntercity transportation includes a VIA Rail train station and a Greyhound Lines of Canada intercity bus depot.\nLocal public transit service is available daily except Sunday on six routes.

The Chief of the Defence Staff (or CDS), the senior professional member of the service, is General Thomas J. Lawson. The CDS answers to a politician, the Minister of National Defence, who is currently of the Liberal Party. \nStructure.\nThe Canadian Forces is composed of 67,000 personnel (soldiers, sailors, and airmen/airwomen). Every unit accepts male and female soldiers, if they qualify for the position. The CF is divided in seven main branches, which are called \"commands\". \nMain Branches.\nThe Environmental branches (called Commands) are mainly administrative structures. They manage the personnel, the equipment and the facilities, but not the operations. There are three commands in the Canadian Forces, because there are no Marines. All the commands work very closely with each other, for example, the Air Force provides helicopters to both the Navy and the Army. These commands also each have a reserve element, made of part-time employees.\nLand Force Command (LFCOM).\nThis is the army of Canada and the largest branch of the CF. It uses tanks and other armoured vehicles, such as the LAV III, as well as artillery, engineering vehicles, and a variety of weapons, such as the Colt Canada C7 rifle.\nMaritime Command (MARCOM).\nThis is the navy of Canada. It has 33 active warships including submarines, frigates and destroyers. \nAir Command (AIRCOM).\nAIRCOM is the air force of Canada. It operates a variety of helicopters and airplanes to support the army and the navy, and also has CF-18 fighters.\nOperational Branches.\nThe Operational commands are responsible for specific types of operations or for conducting exercises or deployments. There are four operational commands.\nSpecial Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM).\nThe CANSOFCOM is responsible for providing special forces and asymmetric warfare capabilities to Canada. It is the smallest command of the Canadian Forces, and is composed of four joint units that do not answer to either the Army, Navy or Air Force. These units are the Joint Task Force 2, the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, the 427th Special Aviation Squadron and the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit (CBRN).\nExpeditionary Force Command (CEFCOM).\nThis is the command responsible for managing foreign operations and deployments outside of Canada, such as Canada's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. \nCanada Command (CANCOM).\nCanada Command works with the United States Northern Command to ensure national security and the defence of the North American continent. CANCOM also is responsible for emergency management, such as when the Army is needed to respond to disasters in Canada.\nOperational Support Command (CANOSCOM).\nThis command is responsible for supporting all the other commands with things such as logistics, engineering, health services, and the military police.\nDefence Policy.\nFrom the second half of the 20th century, the defence policy of Canada is made of these objectives : \nDuring the Cold War, a major focus of the Canadian Forces was helping with the defence of Europe against the threat posed by the Soviet Union.

In its broadest sense, the word \"runes\" can mean any cryptic letters, but it usually means the alphabets used by Scandinavian people from about the year 150 CE to the Middle Ages. The oldest of these is called the \"Elder Fu\u00feark\", used from about 150 to 800 CE. Around the year 800 the runes changed into the \"Younger Fu\u00feark\", and these were used until about 1100, when the Latin alphabet replaced them. The Anglo-Saxon runes were used about the same time (400-1100) in Britain. The Scandinavian runes are called \"Fu\u00feark\" because the first six letters in the runic alphabet are \u16a0 \u16a2 \u16a6 \u16a8 \u16b1 \u16b2 (F U \u00de A R K). The Anglo-Saxon runes are called \"Fu\u00feorc\" because they are a little different.\nRunes are found carved into stones (called runestones) in many places in Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway and Sweden), and in the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Frisia. Runes have been used for writing poems and eulogies, and they are still sometimes used to write ciphers. Runes were also used by J. R. R. Tolkien in his fantasy works, which were based on Germanic mythology. Because of their association with Germanic mythology, runes were also used by the Nazis to support a new mysticism and a romantic sense of Germanic heritage. The rune \u16a6 survived into the Middle Ages in the English language and to modern times in Icelandic as the letter \u00fe (pronounced \"th\" as in \"thing\"). After the Norman conquest, this letter was replaced by the letters \"th\" because it was unknown to the French-speaking Normans. Similarly, the letter \u00f0 (pronounced \"th\" as in \"this\") was used in Old English and is still used in Icelandic, but it is from Irish, not from the runes.\nWhen the runes were first used, the Germanic languages were not yet split into their modern branches; there was only one unified language (called \"Proto-Germanic\") with many regional dialects. Each rune had a name, like our modern letters have names, but these very old names are no longer known. By their association with later letters, the old names of the runes have been reconstructed. The [*] before a rune's Proto-Germanic name means this is a reconstructed name. Not all runes were drawn the same way, however, and some of the runes and their names were different in some places."}

He graduated from University of Ljubljana in 1966 and obtained his master's degree from the same institution in 1972. He obtained his PhD in 1976 with thesis on the relationship between the Slovenian Christian Socialist movement and the Communist Party of Slovenia within the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, which at the time was a somehow problematic topic. In 1984 and 1988, he was awarded the scholarships by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, which enabled him to continue his studies in Cologne and Freiburg. Later, he worked as a researcher at the University of Freiburg. From 1966 to 1995, he collaborated with the Institute for modern history in Ljubljana.

Between 2004 and 2008, he served as chairman of the Party's internal Committee for Education Policies; he quit for disagreements over the Government policy favouring private universities. He became very critical of the then prime minister Janez Jan\u0161a, whom he accused of being a \"liberal with an authoritative touch\" who aspires at becoming a \"Slovenian Pi\u0142sudski\".\nFrom 1992 to 1993, he was the Minister without portfolio for Slovenes abroad in Slovenia in the centre-left government of Janez Drnov\u0161ek. In 2005, he was appointed by the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel as president of the Slovene-Croatian Historical Commission, formed by the governments of the two countries to shed light on the history of the relations between the two nations.\nSelected publications.\nPrunk has written over 500 specialized articles and books.

They were from a noble family. Felix had the title Edler von M\u00fcnzberg. The family moved to Graz in 1868. His father died that same year. In 1881 he went to Leipzig to study philosophy, but soon spent all his time on music. He started his studies at the Conservatory in 1883. At the same time he studied with the great composer and pianist Franz Liszt in Weimar. Liszt helped him to get his first opera performed. In the same year, 1884, he became the director of the K\u00f6nigsberg Opera. He got conducting jobs in Danzig, then in Hamburg and in Mannheim. From 1891 he was Kapellmeister of the Royal Opera and conductor of symphony concerts in Berlin. Then he gave up that job and went to live in Munich.\nIn 1902, at the Festival of Mainz, Weingartner conducted all the symphonies of Beethoven. He was becoming famous in Europe as well as in the USA and in South America. From 1908 to 1911 he was the main conductor of the Vienna Hofoper, following on from Gustav Mahler. He kept the job of conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic until 1927. From 1912 he was again Kapellmeister in Hamburg, but in 1914 he went to Darmstadt. In 1919-20 he was conductor of the Vienna Volksoper. In 1920 he was Professor of the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest. From 1927 to 1934 he was conductor of the Sinfonieorchester Basel. He gave his last concert in London in 1940 and died in Winterthur, Switzerland two years later.\nWeingartner was married five times.\nHis reputation.\nWeingartner thought of himself as a composer just as much as a conductor. However, it is as a conductor that he is remembered today. His compositions are hardly ever played now. He composed in a late-Romantic style, and he was an influence on the composer Erich Korngold. He is best remembered today as one of the great conductors of classical music, who conducted in a precise way without exaggerated effects. He wrote books about music including one about conducting.\nReferences.\nNew Groves Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie, 1980. "}

Humans and other mammals have two, one in each side of the brain. The hippocampus is under the cerebral cortex.\nIt is important in spatial memory and navigation, and helps turn short-term memory into long-term memory. The hippocampus is named after the \"seahorse\" because its shape is similar.\nIn Alzheimer's disease, the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage; memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia the inability to form or retain new memories.\nThe different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus. It has often been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a neural mechanism for storing memory, was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus.\nHippocampus and memory.\nThe connection of hippocampus with memory was made by a famous report. This gave the results of the destruction of the hippocampi by surgery (an attempt to relieve epileptic seizures). The unexpected outcome of the surgery was severe anterograde and partial retrograde amnesia. The patient could not form new memories of events after his surgery, and could not remember any events that occurred just before his surgery. However, he did remember events from many years earlier, right back to his childhood.\nThis case attracted widespread professional interest. Later, other patients with similar damage and amnesia (caused by accident or disease) have also been studied. Thousands of experiments have studied the physiology of changes in synaptic connections in the hippocampus after activity. The hippocampi do play an important role in memory. However, the precise nature of this role remains unclear.\nRecent reviews say how the hippocampus puts together our memories of past events, and helps us remember aspects of complex events.\nHippocampus and orientation.\nNeurons in the rat hippocampus show activity related to the rat's position in its environment. As with the memory theory, there is now almost universal agreement that spatial coding plays an important role in hippocampal function, but the details are widely debated.\nStudies conducted on freely moving rats and mice have shown that many hippocampal neurons have \"place fields\", that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when a rat passes through a particular part of the environment. In humans, cells with location-specific firing patterns have been reported in a study. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had diagnostic electrodes put in their hippocampus. Then a computer was used to move them around in a virtual reality town.\nThe discovery of place cells in the 1970s led to a theory that the hippocampus might act as a cognitive map a neural representation of the layout of the environment. The \"cognitive map hypothesis\" has been further advanced by recent discoveries of direction cells in several parts of the rodent brain which are strongly connected to the hippocampus.\nEvolution.\nThe hippocampus has a generally similar appearance across the mammals from monotremes such as the echidna to primates such as humans. The hippocampal size to body-size ratio increases: it is about twice as large for primates as for the echidna. It does not, however, increase at anywhere close to the rate of the neocortex to body-size ratio. Therefore, the hippocampus takes up a larger fraction of the cortex in rodents than in primates.\nOther vertebrates have areas which may be homologous to the hippocampus of mammals. Some insects, and cephalopods such as the octopus, have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities. These appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, and have evolved independently of the mammalian system."}

It is about a young orphan girl who grows up in the Swiss Alps (mountains in Switzerland) with her grandfather.\nSummary.\nWhen her guardians die, Heidi must live in the mountains with her grandfather, Alm-Uncle, who does not like people. He slowly changes and becomes more caring because of Heidi. Then, Heidi must move to Frankfurt, Germany to be the friend of Clara, a girl who is sick and cannot walk. Clara\u2019s grandmother encourages Heidi to learn to read, and she also learns about God. She becomes very homesick, and a kind doctor says that she must return home to her grandfather. Later, Clara visits Heidi in the Alps and becomes strong enough to walk.\nInspiration.\nJohanna Spyri wrote this story for her son, Berhard Diethelm Spyri. People and places in the story come from Spyry's own life. Catherine Eayrs, a literary critic, thinks that the village of Dorfli may come from Jenins in Switzerland, a place that Spyri visited as a child, however Dorfli is an actual town in Switzerland. Also, the kindly doctor is similar to Spyri's own father, and Klara's grandmother is a good storyteller, just like Spyri's own mother.\nReception.\nImmediately after the book was published, \"Heidi\" was popular, both with children and adults. It continues to be popular, and translations are available in more than fifty languages. About 50 million books have been sold. The story has also been told on movie and television. There is even a musical version.\nVisitors to Switzerland can visit a tourist village called Heididorf in Maienfeld. The name means \"Heidi's village\" in German.\nCriticism.\nSome readers think that one problem of \"Heidi\" is that the book teaches the Christian religion. Malcolm Usrey, a literary critic, thinks that nature is as important as Christianity in helping people, because Klara\u2019s paralysis and Heidi\u2019s home sickness are both healed in the \u201cclean air of the Swiss mountains\u201d."}

He was one of the most famous conductors of the 19th century as well as being a famous pianist. He is especially remembered for his conducting of the operas of Richard Wagner.\nLife.\nB\u00fclow was born in Dresden. His family belonged to the nobility: he had the title of \u201cFreiherr\u201d (similar to the English Baron). When he was nine he had music lessons from Friedrich Wieck who was the father of Clara Schumann. However, his parents said that he had to study law instead of music, and they sent him to Leipzig.\nDuring this time he met Franz Liszt in Weimar and he heard him conduct the music of Wagner. He decided to study music even though his parents did not want him to. He went to Z\u00fcrich where Wagner was living in exile. Wagner thought he was very talented and got him some conducting jobs. In 1851 he went to Weimar to study the piano with Liszt. He worked very hard at his piano technique. He also wrote articles about music. Liszt also thought that von B\u00fclow would become a great musician.\nIn 1853 B\u00fclow made his first concert tour. He played in Vienna, Pest, Dresden, Karlsruhe, Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin. He taught the piano in Berlin and gave a lot of support to young composers who had new ideas about music. He toured as pianist and conductor in Germany and Russia. In 1857 he married Liszt\u2019s daughter, Cosima. They had two daughters.\nIn 1864 he became the Hofkapellmeister in Munich. This was a very important conducting job and it made him extremely famous. He conducted the first performances of two Wagner operas: \"Tristan und Isolde\" (1865) and \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\" (1868). These were extremely successful. Meanwhile Cosima was having a love affair with Richard Wagner. In 1868 she left her husband to live with Wagner, taking their daughters with her. She divorced B\u00fclow, who went to Florence for a while to recover from the shock. However, he always continued to show great respect for Wagner and continued to conduct his music. When Wagner died in 1883 he was terribly sad.\nIn 1872 B\u00fclow toured again. He visited England and the USA where, as the solo pianist, he gave the first performance (world premiere) of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 in Boston in 1875.\nFrom 1878 to 1880 he was conductor in Hanover, but had to leave after a quarrel with a tenor. In 1880 he went to Meiningen where he conducted the orchestra, making it one of the best orchestras in Germany. He made the players perform from memory. He often conducted the music of Johannes Brahms. He thought about every detail of the pieces he conducted. He liked to have two pianos on the stage so that he could face the audience or have his back to them, whichever he wanted.\nDuring this time he met Richard Strauss in Berlin. He helped Strauss, who was a young man at the time, to make his music well known\nHe did new things with his orchestra, such as introducing a double bass with five strings (this is now normal in most European orchestras). He also introduced timpani with pedals. In the late 1880s he settled in Hamburg, but continued to tour, both conducting and performing on the piano.\nB\u00fclow had health problems which gave him very bad headaches. He went to warmer countries to try to get better. He died in a hotel in Cairo, Egypt, ten months after his last concert performance.\nB\u00fclow was not only a conductor and pianist, but also a composer. His piano compositions are influenced by Liszt. They are very difficult to play. He was also very good at writing about music. He always wrote what he thought, even if it offended some people."}

Accuracy is important in surveying the land, navigation of ships, making parts for machines like car engines, looking at stars and planets in astronomy and when doing experiments in science. \nThe working of Vernier scale.\nLength has been measured with a straight ruler for hundreds of years. It measures up to 0.01cm. If the object we are measuring is somewhere in between two of the marks on our ruler then we would have to estimate where between the two marks to take the measurement. A Vernier scale on our ruler does this last fine piece of measuring between the two marks for us. \nSo , for example if the measurement with our eye said it was between 1.5 and 1.6 centimeters, we would look at the Vernier and we would be able to say the measure is actually 1.57, something it would be vary hard to see with the eye alone.\nWhen measuring angles the same problem occurs and a vernier may be part of a device to measure fine angles in between two of the marks on the scale.\nWe don't need to be sharp eyed to read the Vernier scale because its marks are almost as big as our main measuring scale. We just count how many marks there are to the next place where there is a mark on both the main and vernier scales that are exactly lined up. That number of marks tells us the size of the small extra measurement."}

He became internationally famous as the conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra which he made into a world-class orchestra. Since 1999 he has been the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nRattle was born in Liverpool and studied at Liverpool College. He learned to play the piano and the violin. He started to play in orchestras, but as a percussionist. He went to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London in 1971. Three years later he won the John Player Conductor Competition. He organised and conducted a performance of Mahler's Second Symphony whilst still at the Academy. He spent a year studying English Language and literature at St Anne's College, Oxford.\nCareer in the UK.\nIn 1974, he was made assistant conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, and in 1977 assistant conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic.\nHe spent 18 years as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), from 1980 to 1998. During this time he made the orchestra into one of the best European orchestras. The orchestra used to give their concerts at the Town Hall in Birmingham, but a new concert hall, the Symphony Hall, was opened in 1991. The BBC made a film about Rattle and the CBSO during his last year with the orchestra. It was called: \"Simon Rattle \u2014 Moving On\".\nRattle was given the award of CBE in 1987 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1994. In 1992, Rattle was made Principal Guest Conductor of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE), together with Frans Br\u00fcggen. Rattle now has the title of Principal Artist with the OAE. In 2001, Rattle conducted the OAE at Glyndebourne in their first production of Beethoven\u2019s opera \"Fidelio\" with a period instrument orchestra.\nIn May 2006 he was made an Honorary Member of the Society of Arts.\nBerlin Philharmonic Orchestra.\nThe first time Rattle conducted the Berlin Philharmonic (BPO) was in 1987 when he gave a performance of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 6. In 1999 Rattle was made chief conductor of the orchestra when Claudio Abbado left. Before he agreed to take the job he insisted on making some changes to make sure that all the orchestral members were paid fairly and that the orchestra could make its own decisions instead of having to do what the Berlin Senate told them.\nBefore he left England he said some very critical things about the British attitude to culture, especially to music. He thought that not enough money was being spent on the arts and that the politicians were not interested in music.\nHe gave his first concert as principal conductor of the BPO on 7 September 2002, leading performances of Thomas Ad\u00e8s' \"Asyla\" and Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 5. He has done many new things since working in Berlin. He has continued to conduct the music of many living British composers. He has formed an educational programme so that young people in Berlin get used to hearing classical music. Some people have criticised what Rattle has done in Berlin, but many people support him.\nRattle was originally going to stay with the BPO until 2012, but in April 2008 the players decided they want him to stay until 2020\nConducting in North America.\nRattle has toured to many countries during his career. He has conducted in North America. In 1979 he conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic (LAP) and was their Principal Guest Conductor from 1981\u20131994. He also guest-conducted the Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and Boston Symphony Orchestra.\nIn 1993, Rattle conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra. They wanted him to be their chief conductor, but Rattle could not take on the job. Instead, he often performs as their guest conductor. \nMusical styles and recordings.\nRattle has conducted lots of different music, sometimes old music with period instruments, sometimes music by living composers. He is very well known for his performances of Mahler. He has won many awards for his recordings.\nPersonal life.\nRattle has been married three times. He is a fan of Liverpool F.C."}

{"id": "178097", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178097", "title": "Ken Whisenhunt", "text": "Kenneth \"Ken\" Moore Whisenhunt (born February 28, 1962 in Augusta, Georgia) is the American football head coach of the Arizona Cardinals NFL football team, leading them to the first Super Bowl in ream history during the 2008 season. Before that, he was known for his well-planned offensive plays, including the success he had with the Pittsburgh Steelers in his 3 years as their offensive coordinator under Bill Cowher, in which the Steeers won Super Bowl XL during the 2005 season.\nPlaying career.\nAfter attending the Academy of Richmond County in Augusta, Georgia for high school, Whisenhunt played college football at Georgia Tech (1980-84), where he graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering. During his senior season, he was an honorable mention All-American. He also finished first team all-ACC during his final two college seasons.\nWhisenhunt's career as a player included 4 years (1985-88) as a tight end with the Atlanta Falcons, who drafted him in the twelfth round, and then short periods with the Washington Redskins and New York Jets. He retired from the league in 1993 after nine seasons in which he was mostly known as a blocker.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nHe began his coaching career at Vanderbilt University, where he coached special teams, tight ends and H-backs for the Commodores from 1995 to 1996. In 1997, he returned to the NFL as the tight ends coach for the Baltimore Ravens. Whisenhunt changed teams very often in his early years in the league, moving to the staff of the Cleveland Browns in 1999 and to the New York Jets the following season.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nIn 2001, Whisenhunt was hired by the Steelers to coach their tight ends. He was able to make players such as Mark Bruener and Jay Riemersma, both considered no longer at their best, into great blocking backs. He became offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh for the 2004 season after Mike Mularkey became the head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Whisenhunt had instant success in his role. While Mularkey was known for creating exciting trick plays, Whisenhunt became more of a cautious play-caller, whose well-timed trick plays surprised the Steelers' opponents because they were very unlike the conservative Pittsburgh run game.\nWhisenhunt's most famous moment is the trick play he called in Super Bowl XL. With Pittsburgh leading 14-10 over the Seattle Seahawks, Whisenhunt called a wide receiver reverse pass (Antwaan Randle El to Hines Ward, the only TD pass thrown by a WR in Super Bowl history) that allowed Pittsburgh to get a big lead, which they did not give away.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn January 14, 2007 the Arizona Cardinals hired Whisenhunt as their new head coach. The contract he received promised him an average of $2.5 million annually. Whisenhunt had also interviewed for the head coaching position with the Steelers, Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins. In February 2006, the Oakland Raiders were interviewing him to become their new head coach, but Whisenhunt ended the talks before a deal could be offered. The Cardinals were better in Whisenhunt's first season, finishing with 8 wins and 8 losses after finishing with 5 wins and 11 losses the two seasons before that and losing 10 or more games in seven of the previous eight campaigns. It was their first non-losing season since 1998, even though they still failed to make the playoffs.\nBefore his second season, Whisenhunt made the experienced Kurt Warner his starting quarterback. In Whisenhunt's first season, Warner had split time with the team's younger quarterback Matt Leinart, although Warner started the final 11 games of the 2007 season after Leinart suffered a season-ending injury. This was a good decision because Warner put up good numbers in leading the Cardinals to a 9 win and 7 loss regular season record in the 2008 season. This was good enough to win NFC West Division, the Cardinals' first division title since 1975, when the team played in St. Louis, Missouri. Whisenhunt's second season was also the Cardinals' first time in the playoffs since 1998. After beating the Atlanta Falcons and the Carolina Panthers in the first two rounds of the NFC playoffs, the Cardinals defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship on January 18, 2009 and advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history to face the Pittsburgh Steelers. This gave Whisenhunt an opportunity to play against the team he used to be the offensive coordinator of. The Cardinals lost the game 27-23. Whisenhunt credited the Steelers' players and staff with the win, but also said penalties were one of the reasons for the loss.\nCoaching tree.\nWhisenhunt has worked on the staff of four National Football League coaches. They are:\nWhisenhunt has had one future National Football League coach work under him. He was:\nPersonal.\nKen and his wife, Alice, have two children: a son Kenneth Jr., and daughter Mary Ashley."}

It is the second-holiest site in Islam, after Masjid al-Haram in Mecca.\nThe site was originally adjacent to Muhammad's house; he settled there after his Hijra (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE. He shared in the heavy work of building. The original mosque was an open-air building. The mosque served as a community center, a court, and a religious school. There was a raised platform for the people who taught the Quran. Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated it. In 1909, it became the first place in the Arabian Peninsula to be provided with electrical lights. The mosque is under the control of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The mosque is located in what was traditionally the center of Medina, with many hotels and old markets nearby. It is a major pilgrimage site. Many pilgrims who perform the Hajj go on to Medina to visit the mosque due to its connections to the life of Muhammad.\nAfter an expansion during the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I, it now incorporates the final resting place of Muhammad and the first two Rashidun caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar. One of the most notable features of the site is the Green Dome in the south-east corner of the mosque, originally Aisha's house, where the tomb of Muhammad is located. In 1279, a wooden cupola was built over the tomb which was later rebuilt and renovated multiple times in late 15th century and once in 1817.

The orchestra is based in Amsterdam. \u201cConcertgebouw\u201d (pronounced: \u201cCon-SERT-ghe-bouw\u201d) is the Dutch word for \u201cconcert hall\u201d. For nearly a century the orchestra were just called \u201cConcertgebouw Orchestra\u201d, but in 1988 the Queen Beatrix gave them the \"Royal\" title.\nHistory.\nThe concert hall, called the Concertgebouw, was opened on 11 April 1888. The orchestra was formed later that year and gave its first performance on 3 November 1888 under Willem Kes, who was to be their conductor for seven years.\nIn 1895, Willem Mengelberg became chief conductor. He was to be their conductor for fifty years. He made them into a world-class orchestra. He is particularly remembered for his conducting of the music of Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss whose music was new in those days.\nAs well as their chief conductor, the orchestra had assistant conductor positions called \u201cfirst conductor\u201d and \u201csecond conductor\u201d. During Mengelberg\u2019s time the \u201cfirst conductors\u201d included Karl Muck (1921-1925), Pierre Monteux (1924-1934), Bruno Walter (1934-1939), and Eugen Jochum (1941-1943), and the second conductors included the composer Cornelis Dopper, Evert Cornelis and Eduard van Beinum.\nIn 1945, after World War II had ended, Mengelberg was not allowed to conduct the orchestra because he had played to the Nazis. He was banned for six years from conducting them, but he died in 1951 just before the six years came to an end.\nFrom 1945 to 1959, the orchestra's main conductor was Eduard van Beinum, who had sometimes conducted the orchestra since 1929. He was especially fond of the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, and he made recordings of Bruckner's Eighth and Ninth Symphonies for the Philips Records. Van Beinum conducted the orchestra until April 1959 when he suddenly had a heart attack and died during a rehearsal.\nBernard Haitink first conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra on 7 November 1956. After van Beinum's death, Haitink became the orchestra's first conductor in September 1959. From 1961 to 1963, Haitink and Eugen Jochum shared the post of chief conductor of the orchestra. Haitink became the only chief conductor in 1963, and continued in this post until 1988. He had \u201cassistant conductors\u201d, including Edo de Waart and Hans Vonk.\nHaitink made many recordings with the orchestra. In the early 1980s, the Dutch government was going to reduce the amount of money that the orchestra would get. This would mean that 23 musicians would have to lose their job. Haitink said he would resign if they did that. Fortunately the government changed their mind.\nRiccardo Chailly became chief conductor of the orchestra in 1985. He recorded many symphonies with them including symphonies by Mahler, Bruckner and Shostakovich. When he left in 2004 Mariss Jansons became chief conductor.\nIn the December 2008 issue of Gramophone Magazine the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra was ranked as the best symphony orchestra in the world."}

GRUB is the main example of the Multiboot Specification, which allows a user to have more than one operating systems on their computer at once, and to choose which one to run when the computer starts. GRUB can be used to select from different kernel images available on a particular operating system's partitions, as well as to pass boot-time parameters to such kernels.\nFunctioning.\nWhen a computer is turned on, the computer's BIOS finds the primary bootable device (usually the computer's hard disk) and loads the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record (MBR), the first 512 bytes of the hard disk, and then transfers control to this code.\nThe MBR contains GRUB stage 1. Because of the small size of the MBR, Stage 1 just loads the next stage of GRUB (which may be physically elsewhere on the disk). Stage 1 can either load Stage 2 directly, or it can load stage 1.5: GRUB Stage 1.5 is located in the first 30 kilobytes of hard disk immediately following the MBR. Stage 1.5 loads Stage 2.\nWhen GRUB Stage 2 receives control, it presents an interface to the user in order to select which operating system to boot. This normally takes the form of a graphical menu, although if this is not available or the user wishes further control, GRUB has its own command prompt, where the user can manually specify the boot parameters. GRUB can also be set to automatically load a particular kernel after a timeout period.\nOnce boot options have been selected, GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control on to the kernel, which then continues to start itself. At this stage GRUB can also pass control of the boot process to another loader, using \"chain loading\", for operating systems such as Windows that do not support the Multiboot standard. In this case, copies of the other system's boot programs have been saved by GRUB; instead of a kernel, the other system is loaded as though it had been started from the MBR. This may be yet another boot manager, such as the Microsoft boot menu, allowing further selection of non-Multiboot operating systems. (This behavior is often automatic when modern Linux distributions are installed \"on top of\" existing Windows systems, allowing the user to retain the original operating system without changes, including systems that contain multiple versions of Windows.)"}

They are usually built at a height that allows the sound to be heard at some distance. \nThere are different ways to make the bells in a bell tower ring. In many cases, the bell is rung by pulling on a rope that is joined to the bell, making it swing on a hinge and the clapper hit the bell. Another way is to use a keyboard called a carillon. Sometimes, the bells are controlled by a clock mechanism or a computer. This lets them ring at certain times without the need for a human to do it.\nHistory.\nThere are no examples of bell towers in antiquity. The first to use a bell tower in a church was Paulinus of Nola, about the start of the 5th century. Bell towers in Italy have almost always been plain vertical towers not attached to a building (). From the beginning, bell towers in northern Europe have been attached to churches. They were known of in England at least by the time of Bede. When Hilda, Abbess of Whitby died (680 AD), a nun reported hearing the sound of a bell. Bell towers are repeatedly mentioned during the 8th century. One was the campanile of St. Peter's Basilica at Rome.\nBernini's bell towers.\nGian Lorenzo Bernini was Pope Urban XIII's choice to design and build twin bell towers on the front of St. Peter's. His first tower shifted and large cracks appeared. Work on the second tower stopped. Bernini was blamed and called incompetent. When Pope Urban died in 1644 it was not decided what to do about the tower disaster. It was a major setback for Bernini's career and for the future of church bell towers. It was later discovered the ground under the towers was not stable. The towers were torn down. Bernini went on to have an otherwise brilliant career."}

British Muslim extremists did the attacks during the morning rush hour.\nAt 08:50 a.m. three bombs exploded within fifty seconds of each other on three London Underground trains. A fourth exploded an hour later at 09:47 on a bus in Tavistock Square. The bombs were homemade. They were carried in rucksacks and set off by the bombers.\nThere were many memorials and services in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The memorials remembered those who died in the attacks, including a memorial in Hyde Park. There were 56 people who died from the attacks, and over 700 people were hurt in the attack.\nAttacks.\nLondon Underground.\nAt 8:49am, on 7 July 2005, three bombs were set off on London Underground trains within 50 seconds of each other:\nA code amber alert was declared at 9:19am. London Underground began to stop the network's operations, ordering trains to continue only to the next station and stopping all services.\nThe effects of the explosions varied according to the differing designs of the tunnels in which each happened:\nTavistock Square bus.\nA fourth bomb exploded almost an hour after the attacks on the London Underground. It exploded on the deck of a number 30 double-decker bus. The bus was a Dennis Trident 2 from Stagecoach London. It was following the route from Marble Arch to Hackney Wick.\nAt its final destination, the bus turned around and started the return route to Hackney Wick. The bus left Marble Arch at 9:00am and arrived at Euston bus station, the destination, at 9:35am, where crowds of people had been evacuated from the tube and went on buses as a different way of transport.\nThe explosion at 9:47am in Tavistock Square caused the roof to come off and destroyed the back part of the bus. The explosion took place near BMA House, the headquarters of the British Medical Association, on Upper Woburn Place. A number of doctors and medical staff in or near that building were able to provide immediate emergency help.\nPeople who saw the explosion reported seeing \"papers and half a bus flying through the air\". BBC Radio 5 Live and \"The Sun\" later reported that two injured bus passengers said that they saw a man exploding the bomb in the bus.\nThe position of the bomb inside the bus meant the front of the bus remained mostly undamaged from the explosion. Most of the passengers at the front of the top deck remained in the same condition as before, as did those near the front of the lower deck, including the driver. However, those at the back of the bus had more serious injuries, with a few people being blown away from the bus. The level of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a longer delay in announcing the death amount from the bombing while the police looked at how many bodies were there and whether the bomber was one of them. A few people nearby the bus were also hurt by the explosion and the surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.\nThe bombed bus was then covered with tarpaulin and removed so that they could look at the forensics at a secure Ministry of Defence site. The vehicle was later returned to Stagecoach and scrapped on 15 October 2009. A replacement bus, a new Alexander Dennis Enviro400, was named \"Spirit of London\".\nVictims.\n784 people were injured and 52 people were killed by the bombers, not including the deaths of the bombers. The people who died were of many different backgrounds. Some of them were from places outside the United Kingdom. All those who died were UK residents, including exchange students. Because of train delays before the attacks and transport problems after attacks caused by them, a few people died aboard trains and buses they would not normally have taken. The people who died differed in age: the youngest was 20 and the oldest was 60 years old. The average age was 34.\nSeven of the people were killed at Aldgate, six at Edgware Road, 26 at King's Cross and 13 at Tavistock Square.\n784 people were injured by the attacks. Martine Wright, who lost her legs in the attack, would later play in the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Police officers and other emergency services workers helped those who were injured.\nAttackers.\nThe four suicide bombers were:\nAll four of them were associated with Al Qaeda.\nThree of the bombers were born in the United Kingdom, sons of Pakistani immigrants; Lindsay was a convert born in Jamaica.\nCharles Clarke, Home Secretary when the attacks happened, described the bombers as \"cleanskins\" before their role in the attacks. This was a new word: it meant \"unknown to the government\". On the day of the attacks, all four had went to Luton, Bedfordshire, by automobile. The group then went to London by train. They were recorded on CCTV arriving at King's Cross station at about 8:30am.\nRecorded reasonings.\nTwo of the bombers made recordings describing their reasons for becoming what they called \"soldiers\". In a taped broadcast by Al Jazeera on 1 September 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan, described his motivation. The tape had been edited and mentioned al-Qaeda members Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, calling them \"today's heroes\". Khan's tape said:\nThe tape continued:\nOn 6 July 2006, a recorded statement by Shehzad Tanweer was broadcasted by Al-Jazeera. The video was thought to include statements and thoughts by al-Zawahiri. In the video, Tanweer said:\nTanweer thought that the people who weren't Muslims in Britain deserved to be attacked because they voted for a government which \"continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya\".\nEffects and response.\nEarly reports.\nEarly reports suggested that a power surge on the Underground power grid had caused explosions in power circuits, but this was later found out to not be true. Some people suggested that the explanation had been made because of bomb damage to power lines along the tracks. The damage to the power lines caused power surges. A couple of hours after the bombings, Home Secretary Charles Clarke confirmed the incidents were terrorist attacks.\nSafety alerts.\nAlthough there were safety and police alerts at many areas across the United Kingdom, no terrorist attacks took place outside central London. Suspicious packages were found and removed in areas around the United Kingdom. \n\"The Times\" reported on 17 July 2005 that police sniper units were following many people thought to be part of al-Qaeda in Britain. The teams with guns were told to shoot to kill if there was proof that suggested that a person thought to be a terrorist had a bomb on them and didn't want to surrender when asked by police. A person part of the Metropolitan Police's Specialist Firearms Command said that they had been used more often to look at people who might be terrorists.\nTransport and communications problems.\nVodafone reported that its telephone network reached the most it could at about 10am on the day of the bombings, and it was forced to start emergency plans to put emergency calls first. Other phone providers also said they had problems. The BBC thought that the telephone system may have been shut down by security services to prevent the possibility of mobile phones being used to trigger bombs. However, it was actually due to a higher amount of texts and calls being made by people. ACCOLC was working only in a area around Aldgate Tube Station because key emergency workers did not have mobile phones with ACCOLC. The problems with communication when the emergency was happening caused discussion about how to make London's emergency communications system better. Some people said there needed to be better ways to speak between emergency services.\nFor most of the day, central London's public transport system was largely out of service following the complete closure of the Underground and the Zone 1 bus network. The day after the attacks, most London Underground lines would open again. Most of the Zone 1 bus network would open again too. In August 2005, it was reported that when public transport opened again it lost 30% of passengers that were travelling before, with more people walking to where they want to go instead of using public transport. Most of the Underground, apart from the stations that were damaged by the bombs, opened again the next morning.\nOn 2 August, the Hammersmith &amp; City line was reopened. The Piccadilly line started serving customers again on 4 August. On 4 August, the Circle line was reopened again. Before this, Circle line stations continued to have passengers as they were on other lines.\nMayor of London.\nKen Livingstone, the Mayor of London, was in Singapore when he heard about the bombings, after London won their bid to hold the 2012 Summer Olympics. Due to how big the attacks were, he gave a quickly made speech. In his speech, he said the attack was bad and \"cowardly\".\nIn the media.\nThe first reports about the explosions were at 9:16am by Sky News, about half an hour after the first explosion. Sky News would also report the final explosion on the bus a few minutes after it happened. The reporter said that he thought a bomb had exploded on the bus.\nBBC News received 1billion total attempts to access the website during the course of the day (including all images, text and HTML). At top times during the day there were 40,000-page requests per second for the BBC News website. The BBC also received complaints from unhappy people about images they showed when covering the attacks, and the BBC would say sorry for it.\nOn 12 July, the British National Party made leaflets showing images of the 'No. 30 bus' after it was destroyed in the attacks. The slogan, \"Maybe now it's time to start listening to the BNP\" was written down next to the image. Home Secretary Charles Clarke described it as an attempt by the BNP to use the attacks to improve how well they did in politics.\nSome news outside the UK complained that many British governments had treated radical Islamist armed groups too well, as long as they weren't involved in attacking the UK.\nMost United Kingdom newspapers and many worldwide newspapers would have stories and photos of the attacks on their front page. \"The Independent\" used statements from people who saw the attack happened or were on the transport when it happened.\nSome people thought that the attacks caused a 'tipping point' in journalism. The Guardian said that the attacks helped start citizen journalism, and received images from citizens about the attacks. BBC News said that they received 22,000 texts and e-mails from people about the attacks and over 300 images, and said that these played a very important part in how they reported the attacks.\nEffect on the economy.\nThere were only a few reactions to the attack in the world economy as measured by financial market and exchange rate action. The value of the British pound to the U.S. dollar went down. The FTSE 100 Index fell by about 200 points during the two hours after the first attack, being the largest decrease since the invasion of Iraq. After the market closed, it had recovered to only 71.3 points (1.36%) down on the previous day's high.\nUS market values went up a bit, partly because how much the dollar went up compared to the pound and the euro. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up from 31.61 to 10,302.29. The S&amp;P 500 went up 2.93 points to 1,197.87 after going down as much as 1%.\nOn 9 July, the Bank of England, HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority revealed that they had made plans to help stop the economy becoming extremely damaged. They did this immediately after the attacks to make sure that the UK financial markets could continue trading.\nClaims of people helping the bombers.\nEven before the who the bombers were became known, former Metropolitan Police commissioner Lord Stevens said he believed that the bombers were most likely born or based in Britain, and would likely not fit the usual description of a suicide bomber.\nSome newspapers in Iran blamed the bombing on British or American governments looking to have reason to continue the War on Terror, and claimed that the plan that included the bombings also involved more harassment of Muslims in Europe.\nOn 13 August, using what the police and MI5 sources, \"The Independent\" reported that the bombers did the attacks without help from al-Qaeda from somewhere outside the UK.\nOn 1 September, it was reported that al-Qaeda officially claimed that they did the attacks in a recording shown by Al Jazeera. However, an official investigation by the British government reported that the tape claiming that al-Qaeda did it had been edited after the attacks. The British government also said that the bombers did not have direct help from al-Qaeda. Zabi uk-Taifi, an al-Qaeda laeder arrested in Pakistan in January 2009, may have been involved in planning the bombings, according to the Pakistani government. Documents found by the German government on a person thought to be a terrorist arrested in Berlin in May 2011 have suggested that Rashid Rauf, a British al Qaeda member, played a very important role in planning the attacks.\nA second claim of being behind the attack was posted on the internet by another al-Qaeda related group, Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades. This claim was questioned, as the group had previously falsely claimed that they were behind events that were the result of technical problems. They had previously claimed they were behind the 2003 London blackout and the US Northeast blackout of 2003.\nConspiracy theories.\nA poll of 500 British Muslims by Channel 4 News in 2007 found that 24% of them believed the four bombers that were behind the attacks did not actually carry them out.\nThere have been many different conspiracy theories proposed about the bombings, including the suggestion that the bombers were 'patsies', based on claims when the bombings of the trains happened, supposed explosions below the trains, and allegations of the faking of the one time labelled and dated photograph of the bombers at Luton station. Claims made by one theorist in the Internet video \"7/7 Ripple Effect\" were looked at by the BBC documentary series \"The Conspiracy Files\", in an episode named \"7/7\" first shown on 30 June 2009, which debunked many of the video's claims as false.\nOn the day of the bombings, Peter Power of Visor Consultants gave interviews on BBC Radio 5 Live and ITV saying that he was working on an attack management simulation drill, in the City of London. It was based on a situation in which multiple bombs were exploded at the same time, when he heard that an attack was going on in real life. He described this as a coincidence. After a few days he said it was a \"spooky coincidence\" on Canadian TV.\nAlexander Litvinenko, a former officer of Russia's Federal Security Service, was asked who he thought the people who carried out the attacks were, in an interview. Litvinenko stated, \"You know, I have spoken about it earlier and I shall say now, that I know only one organization, which has made terrorism the main tool of solving of political problems. It is the Russian special services.\"\nSome of the conspiracy theories, such as those saying that there was a 5th bomber, were debunked after an official independent investigation.\nInvestigation.\nEarly results.\nEarly on, there was a lot of confusion about what happened in the attacks. Police thought early on that military level plastic explosives were used. As the explosions were thought to happen at the same time, bombs with timed fuses might have been used. What the police thought changed as more information became available. Home-made organic peroxide-based explosives were used, according to a May 2006 report from the British government's Intelligence and Security Committee. The explosive was triacetone triperoxide.\nFifty-six people, including the four suicide bombers, were killed by the attacks. About 700 people were injured, and about 100 stayed in hospital after treatment. The incident was one the most deadly terror attacks in the United Kingdom.\nPolice looked at about 2,500 items of CCTV footage and forensic evidence from where the attacks took place. In the London Underground bombings, police said they believed the bombs were probably placed on the floors of the trains. The bombings were the first ever suicide attack in the British Isles.\nVincent Cannistraro, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency's anti-terrorism centre, said to \"The Guardian\" \"two unexploded bombs were found as well as a device of a timer\". This claim was mainly rejected by London's Metropolitan Police Service.\nPolice raids.\nWest Yorkshire Police raided six buildings in the areas near and in Leeds on 12 July: two houses in Beeston, two in Thornhill, one in Holbeck and one in Alexandra Grove in Hyde Park, Leeds. One man was arrested. Officers also raided a house on Northern Road in the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury on 13 July.\nThe police said a large amount of stuff that could be used as bombs was found in the Leeds raids and a controlled explosion was carried out at one of the houses. Explosives were also found in the vehicle associated with one of the bombers, Shehzad Tanweer, at Luton railway station. They were exploded in a controlled explosion by the police.\nMarch 2007 arrests.\nOn 22 March 2007, three men were arrested as they were believed to have been involved with the bombings. Two of the men were arrested at 1pm at Manchester Airport, trying to go on a flight to Pakistan. They were arrested by officers who work against terrorism and had been following the men as part of an investigation. A third man was arrested in the Beeston area of Leeds at a home on the street where one of the suicide bombers had lived before the attacks.\nThe three arrested were thought to be friends of the bombers, living in the same area as them and going to the same mosque. They were put in court twice because of what they were thought to have done. This was because the jury in the first trial did not agree whether they were guilty or not. In the second trial, they were found to not have helped the bombers attack London, but the two arrested at the airport were later went to prison for 7 years for being taught in terrorism by al-Qaeda.\nMay 2007 arrests.\nOn 9 May 2007, police made four more arrests, three in Yorkshire and one in Selly Oak, Birmingham. The widow of Mohammed Sidique Khan, the person thought to be leader of the bombers, was one of those arrested for helping the terrorists.\nThree of those arrested, including Khan's widow, were released on 15 May. The fourth person who was arrested, Khalid Khaliq, an unemployed father of three children, was charged on 17 July 2007 with having an al-Qaeda training book, but the charge was not related to the 2005 London attacks. These charges usually carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.\nReports of warnings.\nNo warnings were given before 7 July bombings. The following are sometimes quoted as warnings either of the events to come or of some knowledge of future events.\nAnwar al-Awlaki.\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" said that extreme imam Anwar al-Awlaki had inspired the bombers. The bombers also listened and wrote down what they heard al-Awlaki saying in lectures. His teachings were found in the ownership of people who were accused of helping the suicide bombers. Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. attack using drones in 2011.\nIndependent investigation.\nIn 2006, the government said they wouldn't hold a public investigation, saying that it would be silly. Prime Minister Tony Blair said an independent investigation would lower support for MI5. The leader of the opposition, David Cameron, said only a full investigation would \"get to the truth\". In reaction to discoveries about how big the security and police investigations into the bombers before the attack, the Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, said: \"It is becoming more and more clear that the story presented to the public and Parliament is at odds with the facts.\"\nAfter David Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010, an independent coroner's investigation of the bombings started. Lady Justice Hallett was appointed to hear the investigation, which would consider how each victim died and if the MI5, if it had worked better, could have prevented the attack, and also improved the emergency service response.\nAfter seven months of looking at and talking about proof, the investigation was released and read in the Houses of Parliament on 9 May 2011. It decided that the 52 people who the bombers killed had been illegally killed. It also said their deaths could not have been prevented, and they would probably have died no matter how much the emergency services tried to save them. Hallett said the that MI5 had not made every possible improvement since the attacks but that it was not \"right or fair\" to say more attention should have been paid to leader of the bombers Mohammad Sidique Khan before 7 July. She also decided that there should be no public investigation.\nAlleged newspaper phone hacking.\nIt was reported in July 2011 that families of some of the victims of the bombings may have had their telephones accessed by the \"News of the World\" after the attacks. The discoveries added to the then ongoing controversy over phone hacking.\nThe dads of two of the people killed in the bombings, one in the Edgware Road explosion and another at Russell Square, told the BBC that police officers looking into the alleged hacking had warned them that their contact details were found on a target list. A person who used to be a firefighter who helped hurt passengers get away from Edgware Road also was told by police who were looking into the hacking allegations. It later turned out he had been hacked multiple times by \"News of the World\". A few of survivors from the bombed trains also told the media that police had warned them their phones may have been accessed and their messages seen by hackers. In some cases police officers suggested that they should change security codes and PINs.\nTwo of the survivors of the attacks as well as the mum of one of the people who died sued \"News of the World\" for hacking their phones.\nMemorials.\nSince the bombings, the United Kingdom and other nations have remembered the victims in many different ways. Most of these memorials have included moments of silence, religious remembrance services and the laying of flowers at the attack sites. Foreign leaders have also remembered the dead by asking for their flags to be flown at half-staff. They also signed books showing that they were also sad about the attacks at embassies of the UK, and gave statements of support to the British people.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIt was asked that the Union Flag be put at half-staff by the government.\nA permanent memorial was opened on the 7 July 2009 by Prince Charles to remember the fourth anniversary of the bombings. On the ninth anniversary of the bombings, graffiti was found on the memorial. It would be removed soon after being found.\nDuring the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, there was a memorial to the people who were killed by the bombings.\nA remembrance religious service was held in St. Paul's Cathedral on 7 July 2015. This was shown on BBC One.\nInternational.\nUS President George W. Bush went to the British embassy the day after the bombings, after he came back from the G8 summit in Scotland. He signed a book saying that he was sad about the attacks. In Washington, D.C., the US Army band played \"God Save the Queen\". This was an idea that US Army veteran John Miska suggested to Vice Chief of Staff General Cody, outside the British embassy in the city. A similar memorial had been made by the Queen in the days after the September 11 attacks in 2001 where the Star Spangled Banner was played at Buckingham Palace's Changing the Guard. On 12 July, a Detroit Symphony Orchestra band group played the British national anthem during the before game celebrations of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit.\nIt was ordered that flags fly at half-staff across New Zealand and Canada.\nMoments of silence took place in the European Parliament, the Polish parliament and by the Irish parliament on 14 July. The British national anthem was played at Plaza de Oriente in Madrid to remember the people who died from the attacks. The British ambassador to Spain and people in the Spanish Royal Family went there.\nPlanned anniversary attack.\nMohammed Rehman and Sana Ahmed Khan were sent to life in prison on 29 December 2015 for preparing an act of terrorism. The plan was for it to be on the tenth anniversary of the 7 July 2005 London attacks. They had 10kg of urea nitrate to make bombs. Rehman called himself the 'silent bomber' and asked his Twitter followers to choose between the Westfield shopping centre or the London Underground as the place where the planned suicide bombing would take place. He was found by the police because of his posts on Twitter. Rehman was found and arrested a few days before the planned attacks."}

After participating in the Seven Years' War, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Field Marshal by 1773. In the Russo-Turkish-Austrian war of 1788, he commanded an army corps under Freiherr von Laudon, occupying Moldavia, capturing Khotyn in Bessarabia and sharing in Aleksandr Suvorov's success in the Battle of Foc\u015fani (August 1, 1789). Having completely beaten the main Ottoman army under Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha in the Battle of Rymnik, he captured the greater part of Wallachia, including Bucharest, being welcomed by the population after the flight of Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes. Soon after that, he became a Field General.\nDuring the occupation of Moldavia, Josias met Therese Stroffeck, a regular person. On September 24, 1789, in the town of Roman, she gave birth to a son. The son's name was Frederick. Josias married Therese after their return to Coburg, on December 24. He then said that he was the father of Frederick. Frederick was by the Austrian Emperor on August 25, 1808. On February 17, 1853 the Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha created him \"Freiherr von Rohmann\", named after the place of his birth. But Frederick, because he was born before his parents were married, did not inherit the duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.\nIn 1793 and 1794, Josias commanded the army in the Austrian Netherlands during the Flanders Campaign. Because of his victories in the French Revolutionary Wars (in the Battle of Neerwinden (1793) and the Battle of Aldenhoven (1794)), he returned the region to Austrian control. Entering France, he took Cond\u00e9, Valenciennes, Quesnoy and Landrecies. However, due to poor positioning he suffered a string of minor setbacks. This poor positioning was caused by disunity amongst the Allied powers and their forces. His army than suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Fleurus (26 June). \nAfter these losses, Josias left the Netherlands. Habsburg diplomats had already decided to give up the region, anyway. Upset by both this and the policies of the Baron Thugut, Josias resigned as Field Marshal. The Count of Clerfayt took over the position. Josias then went to Coburg, where he later died."}

Outside the Netherlands it is often known as The Hague Philharmonic. The name \u201cResidentie\u201d (\u201cResidence\u201d) shows that it comes from The Hague, which is where the Dutch parliament meets. The Hague is the \u201cresidence of the Queen\u2019s parliament\u201d, although it is not the capital city of the Netherlands. The orchestra are internationally famous.\nHistory of the Orchestra.\nThe orchestra started to form in 1903 when a group of musicians who called themselves the \u201cResidentie Orkest\u201d gave a concert in the Gebouw voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Building for Arts and Sciences) in the centre of the Hague. By the end of the following year they had formed to give regular concerts. Their concert on 20 November 1904 is taken to be the official beginning of the orchestra.\nThe first conductor of the orchestra was Henri Viotta, who soon made it a very good orchestra. Famous composers came to conduct their own works with the orchestra. These included Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Max Reger and Maurice Ravel. The orchestra was sometimes conducted by the Dutch composer Peter van Anrooy, as well as their guest conductor George Szell.\nThe orchestra continued to be internationally known, and some very famous conductors came to conduct the orchestra, including Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter, Leonard Bernstein and Hans Knappertsbusch.\nDuring the years after World War II, from 1949 to 1973, Willem van Otterloo was the chief conductor. They gave regular concerts in the Hague and in Amsterdam and made recordings for Philips Gramophone. Van Otterloo introduced them to many different styles of music. As in its earlier days, the orchestra often played modern music conducted by the composers: Bruno Maderna, Mauricio Kagel, John Cage and Pierre Boulez conducted their works. Recordings were made with other conductors including Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Evgenii Svetlanov who included music by less well-known Russian composers.\nJaap van Zweden, who conducted the orchestra for the first five years of this century, took them on tour to Japan and South America and they made recordings to celebrate 100 years of the orchestra. Van Zweden is still Honorary Guest Conductor of the orchestra.\nToday the orchestra\u2019s chief conductor is Neeme J\u00e4rvi. Many new things have been started, including some concerts given by the Residentie Scratch Orchestra, in which amateur players can join the professional players of the orchestra to give a concert.\nConcert halls.\nThe Residentie Orchestra gave many of their concerts in the Gebouw voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen (more simply known as \u201cK&amp;W Building\u201d), but also the summer concerts in the Kurzaal in Scheveningen, the seaside resort of the Hague, were very famous. Until 1915 these had been given by the Orchestre Lamoureux. The Residentie took them over and continued them until 1968.\nThe orchestra moved out of the K&amp;W Building in 1964. Shortly afterwards the building was destroyed by fire. The Residentie Orchestra gave their regular concerts in the Kurzaal until 1968 when they moved to the Congresgebouw (Congress Building) in the west of the Hague. This was still not a very good concert hall and in 1987 they were able to move to the new Dr. Anton Philipszaal in the centre of the town. There are plans now to build a completely new arts complex there."}

These ancient sculptures were built and buried over two thousand years ago near the city of Xi'an. They were discovered in 1974 by farmers digging a well looking for underground water. Over a thousand terracotta warriors and horses have been uncovered since then. At least 6,000 more are thought to remain buried still.\nAccording to the Chinese historian Sima Qian, Qin Shi Huang ordered this army to be built long before he became the first Emperor of all China in 221 BC. Work started when he was King of Qin in 247 BC. They were constructed to protect him in the afterlife. He died in 210 BC. Over 700,000 workers were needed to build the underground city where he was buried. It is thought to be filled with riches and decorated beautifully. The Chinese government has no plans to uncover the underground palace.\nEach terracotta warrior is made of clay. They are around 2 meters tall, with commanders in the army being the tallest. The sculptures are so detailed that it is possible to guess the age, rank and personality of each one. None of the soldiers are the same. Some carry weapons such as daggers, bows and arrows, swords, spears or axes.\nAssembly line.\nThe terracotta army figures were made in workshops. The head, arms, legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled. Studies show that eight face moulds were most likely used, and then clay was added to provide individual facial features. Once put together, features such as facial expressions were added. \nIt is thought their legs were made the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were made at the time. This would make it an assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times, each workshop had to write its name on items produced. Once they were completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty."}

Showing that he loved Allah more than his own son. And at the final moment, after taking his son's consent, as he was swinging his axe to kill his son God told an angel to switch a lamb instead of his son, and this act of sacrificing a lamb is copied by Muslims all over the world on Eid.\nIbrahim was tempted by Satan not to listen to God, and Ibrahim drove Satan away by throwing pebbles at him. This is also still commemorated by Muslims during Hajj.\nPractices, traditions and observations.\nEid prayer.\nThe Eid prayer must be offered in congregation. It consists of two Rakaah (units) with seven Takbirs in the first Raka'ah and five Takbirs in the second Raka'ah.\nSacrifice.\nThe sacrifice of an animal, usually a cow, sheep or a goat, is a very important part of Eid. The act repeats what Ibrahim did, and also shows Muslims' devotion to God (Allah).\nCelebrations.\nMuslims celebrate by having a feast, and giving gifts to the poor. In some Muslim traditions gifts are also given to children. In Muslim countries the day is given as a national holiday."}

{"id": "178349", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178349", "title": "History of saffron cultivation", "text": "The history of saffron growing reaches back more than 3,000 years. The wild plant from which the saffron crocus came was called \"Crocus cartwrightianus\". Humans began choosing wild plants that had long \"stigmas\". Gradually, a form of \"C. cartwrightianus\", \"C. sativus\", came into being in the late Bronze Age Crete. Experts believe that the first document to mention saffron is a 7th-century BC Assyrian book about botany which was written in the time of Ashurbanipal. Since then, we have found evidence for the use of saffron in the treatment of about 90 illnesses during the past 4,000 years.\nMediterranean.\nThe Minoans had pictures of saffron in their palaces as long ago as 1500\u20131600\u00a0BC, showing how it could be used as a medicine. Later, Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia, where adventurers hoped to find the world's most valuable saffron. Another legend tells how someone named Crocus was bewitched and transformed into the original saffron crocus. Ancient Mediterranean peoples - including perfumers in Egypt, physicians in Gaza, townspeople in Rhodes, and the Greek \"hetaerae\" courtesans- used saffron in their perfumes, ointments, potpourris, mascaras, divine offerings, and medical treatments.\nIn late Hellenistic Egypt, Cleopatra used saffron in her baths to make her feel good. Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments. Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such Levant cities as Sidon and Tyre. Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and scabies, and in the mithridatium. Such was the Romans' love of saffron that Roman colonists took their saffron with them when they settled in southern Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until Rome's fall. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th century AD Moors or with the Avignon papacy in the 14th century AD.\nAsia.\nPaints made from saffron were being used for drawing 50,000 years ago. These have been found in the country that is today called Iraq. Later, people called the Sumerians used wild-growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions. Traders carried saffron for long distances before the 2nd millennium BC. Ancient Persians were growing their own type of saffron (\"Crocus sativus\" 'Hausknechtii') in Derbena, Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. Sometimes saffron threads were woven into textiles. They were given as offerings to the gods and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Saffron threads were also scattered across beds and mixed into hot tea as a way of curing sad feelings. Other people were afraid that the Persians would use saffron as a drug and aphrodisiac. During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his tea, rice, and baths to help heal his battle wounds. Alexander's troops copied their leader's actions and brought the habit of saffron-bathing back to Greece.\nNo one knows how saffron arrived in South Asia. Traditional Kashmiri and Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 900\u20132500 years ago. Meanwhile, historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime prior to 500\u00a0BC, attributing it to either Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks or to a Persian invasion and colonization of Kashmir. Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy. From there, saffron use in foods and dyes spread throughout South Asia. For example, Buddhist monks in India adopted saffron-coloured robes after the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama's death. However, the robes were not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric, a less expensive dye, or jackfruit.\nSome historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia. On the other hand, saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the forty-volume \"Shennong Bencaojing\" (\u795e\u8fb2\u672c\u8349\u7d93\u2014\"Shennong's Great Herbal\", also known as \"Pen Ts'ao\" or \"Pun Tsao\") pharmacopoeia, a tome dating from 200\u2013300\u00a0BC. Traditionally attributed to the legendary \"Yan\" (\"Fire\") Emperor (\u708e\u5e1d) Shennong, it documents 252 phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders. Yet around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. For example, Wan Zhen, a Chinese medical expert, reported that \"[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha.\" Wan also reflected on how saffron was used in his time: \"The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine.\"\nEurope.\nIn Europe, saffron cultivation declined steeply following the Roman Empire's fall. Saffron was reintroduced when the Islamic civilization \"Al-Andalus\" spread to Spain, France, and Italy. During the 14th century Black Death, demand for saffron-based medicine skyrocketed, and much saffron had to be imported via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week long \"Saffron War\". The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred significant saffron cultivation in Basel, which grew prosperous. Cultivation and trade then spread to Nuremberg, where epidemic levels of saffron adulteration brought on the \"Safranschou\" code, under which saffron adulterers were fined, imprisoned, and executed. Soon after, saffron cultivation spread throughout England, especially Norfolk and Suffolk. The Essex town of Saffron Walden, named for its new specialty crop, emerged as England's prime saffron growing and trading center. However, an influx of more exotic spices such as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla from newly contacted Eastern and overseas countries caused European cultivation and usage of saffron to decline. Only in southern France, Italy, and Spain, did significant cultivation endure.\nEuropeans brought saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing saffron corms; indeed, many Schwenkfelders had widely grown saffron in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch were cultivating saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold. The trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-transporting merchant vessels were destroyed. Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. American saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania."}

This is a pitcher's main job. The pitcher tries to get the player who is at-bat out. If a pitcher throws three strikes, the batter strikes out (unless the third strike is a foul tip). A strike is when a pitch is in the zone from the batter's knees to the belt and the width of home plate (the \"strike zone\"), and if the batter does not swing. A strike is also called if a batter swings at any pitch and misses, or if a batter hits a ball into foul territory (this is called a \"foul tip\"). If a pitcher throws a ball outside of the strike zone and the batter does not swing, this is called a \"ball\". If four of these are thrown, the batter gets to go to first base for free. This is called a \"walk\".\nPitchers use different pitches to try to get the batter out. The most common is a fastball. A fastball is when the pitcher throws the ball as hard as he or she can. The pitcher is trying to get the ball past the batter before the batter can hit it. Another type of pitch is a changeup. A pitcher throws a changeup when he or she wants the batter to swing before the ball gets to home plate. The batter might do this because he or she thinks the pitch is a fastball and the baseball will get to the plate faster. In addition to these two types of pitches, there are also many others."}

{"id": "178456", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178456", "title": "Hanged, drawn and quartered", "text": "To be hanged, drawn and quartered was a punishment in England used for men found guilty of treason. \nThe full punishment was made up of the following - the victim was:\nTypically, the five body parts (i.e. the four quarters of the body and the head) would be put on public display in different parts of the city, town, or - in more famous cases such as that of William Wallace - in the country, to discourage would-be traitors who had not seen the execution. After the Crimes Act 1814 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the prisoner was instead hanged until dead - not having to suffer the extremely painful remainder of the punishment while alive. The public display of the bodies of executed prisoners (whether by \"hanging, drawing and quartering\", or some other method) was removed from English criminal law in 1843; \"drawing\" and \"quartering\" in 1870.\nThere is debate among modern historians about whether \"drawing\" referred to the dragging to the place of execution or the disembowelling, but since two different words are used in the official documents detailing the trial of William Wallace (\"\"detrahatur\" for drawing as a method of transport, and \"devaletur\"\" for disembowelment), there is no doubt that the subjects of the punishment were disembowelled.\nJudges delivering sentence at the Old Bailey also seemed to have had some confusion over the term \"drawn\", and some sentences are summarized as \"Drawn, Hanged and Quartered\". Nevertheless, the sentence was often recorded quite explicitly. For example, the record of the trial of Thomas Wallcot, John Rouse, William Hone and William Blake for offences against the king, on 12 July 1683 concludes as follows:\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes both meanings of \"drawn\": \"To draw out the viscera or the like, to the place of execution\". It states that \"In many cases of executions it is uncertain [which of these senses of \"drawn\"] is meant. The presumption is that where \"drawn\" is mentioned after \"hanged\", the sense is [the second meaning].\"\nThe condemned man would usually be sentenced to the short drop method of hanging, so that the neck would not break. The man was usually dragged alive to the quartering table, although in some cases men were brought to the table dead or unconscious. A splash of water was usually employed to wake the man if unconscious, then he was laid down on the table. A large cut was made in the gut after removing the genitalia, and the intestines would be spooled out on a device that resembled a dough roller. Each piece of organ would be burned before the sufferer's eyes, and when he was completely disembowelled, his head would be cut off. The body would then be cut into four pieces, and the king would decide where they were to be displayed. Usually the head was sent to the Tower of London and, as in the case of William Wallace, the other four pieces were sent to different parts of the country. The head was generally par-boiled in brine to preserve the appearance of the head in display, while the quarters were more often prepared in pitch, for longer-lasting deterrent displays."}

They live in different habitats including lakes, rivers, estuaries, freshwater marshes, and mangrove swamps. \nThe Nile Crocodile is carnivorous, or eats meat. The Nile crocodile eats bigger animals as it gets bigger. Young crocodiles will eat insects and small fish, while adult crocodiles can catch and eat zebras, antelopes, wildebeests and buffalo. The Nile Crocodile will attack anything, even other crocodiles. \nThe crocodiles mate in the water, and then the female lays her eggs in a hole dug in the ground. They can lay 60 eggs which take about 90 days to hatch. One unique thing about the Nile crocodile is that the female will guard the eggs until they hatch. Young crocodiles are able to reproduce when they get to about 12 years old."}

It is sometimes used together with other drugs to treat hej. In most countries, its use needs to be prescribed by a doctor.\nThe most common side-effects of taking the drug are nervousness and sleeping problems. About one in ten patients see these problems.

Some cases of Tourette syndrome and psychosis have been reported, amongst others.\nSometimes, the drug has been prescribed to children without proper ADHD diagnosis to increase their academic performance. This use has been criticized by the media. Using methylphenidate in children may be problematic because it has been linked with slower growth. The media often use the name Ritalin for all drugs containing methylphenidate, and even for other stimulants used to treat ADHD.

It is due to uncontrolled growth of pigment cells, called melanocytes. According to a report by the WHO, about 48,000 people die of melanoma every year. Melanoma is prominent in New Zealand and Australia due to the hole in the ozone layer and the many beaches.\nMelanoma that has metastasised (spread beyond the initial primary tumor) is treated with Dacarbizine or Interleukin-2, also known as Proleukin, in many cases. Interleukin-2 has a response rate of up to sixteen-percent. Recent studies support the use of a new drug called Ipilimumab, which appears to prolong survival in metastatic melanoma patients.

He is a citizen of Argentina, Israel, Spain, and the Palestinian Authority.\nBarenboim (meaning \"pear tree\" in Yiddish) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina; his grandparents were Russian Ashkenazi Jews. At first he was famous as a pianist but now he is just as well known as a conductor. He is particularly important for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra which works with young Arab and Israeli musicians. \nBarenboim has often criticized the illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. In 2001 he made many people in Israel angry by conducting the music of Wagner in a concert. Wagner\u2019s music had not been performed in Israel since 1938 because Wagner had been accused of being anti-Jewish and because he had been Hitler's favourite composer. However, Hitler and Wagner had not personally known each other, as the composer died in 1883 and Hitler was born in 1889.\nLife.\nCareer.\nBarenboim was born in Buenos Aires in Argentina. He started piano lessons when he was five. At first his mother taught him, but soon his father became his teacher and he remained the only piano teacher he had. When he was seven years old he gave a concert in Buenos Aires.\nIn 1952, the Barenboim family moved to Israel. In 1954 he went to Salzburg to take part in Igor Markevitch's conducting classes. There he met famous people such as Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler whose conducting inspired him. Furtw\u00e4ngler was very impressed by the young boy and asked him to play Beethoven\u2019s First Piano Concerto with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, but his father did not want him to play in Berlin because it was too soon after the Nazis had murdered millions of Jews.\nIn 1955 Barenboim studied harmony and composition with Nadia Boulanger in Paris.\nBarenboim played the piano in Vienna and Rome in 1952, Paris in 1955, London in 1956.

He made his first appearance at Bayreuth in 1981 and he often conducted there until 1999. \nBarenboim was conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1991 to 2006.\nBarenboim now lives in Berlin. He is the conductor of the \"Staatsoper Unter den Linden\" (Berlin State Opera) and the Berlin Staatskapelle.

He has made many recordings as conductor, including all the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Schumann, and many operas by Wagner.\nBarenboim wrote a book called \"Everything is Connected\" in which he writes about music being a metaphor for life and society.\nAs well as the famous classical composers he has performed 20th century music, Baroque music and tangos from Argentina.\nPolitical side of his career.\nIn 2001 he made many people in Israel angry because he conducted Wagner\u2019s music at a concert there. Wagner was not allowed to be performed in Israel because he had been anti-Jewish. He changed the programme, but then decided to play some Wagner as an encore at the end of the concert. He spoke to the audience and said that anyone who did not want to hear the music could leave the hall. There was an argument for half an hour. In the end some people left, but most of them stayed and listened, and then applauded enthusiastically at the end.\nBarenboim has given performances in the West Bank to show that he has sympathy with the Palestinians. The Israeli government told him it would be too dangerous to go to Ramallah, but he went into the town during the night to give a piano recital. \nIn 1999, Barenboim started the West-Eastern Divan orchestra with the help of a Palestinian-American professor Edward Said, who was a close friend.\nThe orchestra brings young musicians from Israel and Arab countries together every summer.

The name of the orchestra comes from a group of poems by the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\nThe West-Eastern Divan Orchestra was started to help bring Israelis and Palestinians together to work for peace and to help solve the fight between Israel and Palestine. The idea was to let Israelis and Arabs work together in countries which had nothing to do with the conflict.\nThe first workshop of the orchestra took place in Weimar, Germany because it was the 1999 European cultural town. Barenboim chose two leaders for the orchestra: one Israeli and one Arab. They worked with some very famous musicians including the cellist Yo Yo Ma. In 2000 the orchestra met again in Weimar, in 2001 they met in Chicago. Since 2002 they have met every year in Seville. \nThe West-Eastern Divan Workshop takes place during several weeks each summer in Andalusia. After the workshop has finished, the orchestra travel to other places to give concerts. They have given concerts in many parts of Europe, North America, South America. In 2004 they performed an historic concert in Ramallah in Palestine. After the concert Barenboim said that the people of Israel and Palestine had a shared future. He said: \u201cEither we all kill each other, or we share what there is to share. It is this message that we come here to bring.\"\nIn 2004, the Barenboim-Said Foundation, based in Seville, was started to help develop several education projects. Money is given for this by the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda (Regional Government of Andalusia). The Foundation helps with the orchestra as well as with projects such as the Early Childhood Musical Education Project in Seville.\nThe orchestra has won prizes and made recordings.

President Lincoln was shot while watching the play \"Our American Cousin\" at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.. He died early the next morning.\nLincoln's killer, John Wilkes Booth, was an actor and Confederate supporter who had plotted with other men to kill the Secretary of State, William H. Seward and the Vice President Andrew Johnson. Booth hoped to create disorder and overthrow the Northern government by doing this. Booth was able to kill Lincoln, but Seward and Johnson survived. Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated.\nEvents.\nOn April 14, Lincoln went to attend a play with his wife at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C..\nDuring the third act of the play, following a line in the play that was the biggest laugh of the night, Lincoln was laughing at this line when he was shot. John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, entered the presidential box and fired a pistol at point-blank range into the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln immediately lost consciousness, but he passed into unconsciousness with laughter and a smile on his face. Katherine M. Evans, a young actress in the play, who was offstage when Lincoln was shot but rushed onstage after Booth's exit stated \"I looked and saw President Lincoln unconscious, his head dropping on his breast, his eyes closed, but with a smile still on his face\". Lincoln was carried across the street to Petersen House. He was placed diagonally on the bed because his tall frame would not fit normally on the smaller bed. He remained in a coma for nine hours. He died the next morning. As he died his breathing grew quieter, his face more calm. According to some accounts, at his last drawn breath, on the morning after the assassination, he smiled broadly and then expired. Historians, most notably author Lee Davis have emphasized Lincoln's peaceful appearance when and after he died: \"It was the first time in four years, probably, that a peaceful expression crossed his face.\" Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Lincoln Administration, Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote, \"I had never seen upon the President's face an expression more genial and pleasing.\" The President\u2019s secretary, John Hay, saw \"a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features\".\nAfter being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some south of Washington. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant Boston Corbett on April 26."}

This was supposed to be impossible under the kind of economics described by Keynes (Keynesian economics).\nStagflation is a portmanteau word of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\". It is used in economics when the inflation rate is high, the growth rate slows down, and unemployment stays high. It raises a dilemma for economic policy since actions designed to lower inflation may exacerbate unemployment, and vice versa.\nThe term is generally attributed to a British politician who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1970, Iain Macleod, who coined the phrase in his speech to Parliament in 1965. \nKeynes didn't use the term, but some of his work refers to the conditions most would recognise as stagflation. In the version of Keynesian macroeconomic theory which was dominant between the end of World War II (WWII) and the late-1970s, inflation and recession were regarded as mutually exclusive, the relationship between the two being described by the Phillips curve. Stagflation is very costly and difficult to stop once it starts.\nA political measure called the Misery Index is got by adding the inflation rate to the unemployment rate.\nThis situation usually begins with things beginning to cost more while fewer of the things are being made. Because fewer things are being made, fewer people are needed to make them. This causes unemployment to increase. All three of these factors together cause stagflation \u2014 stagnation in production and employment and increasing inflation. It is also because of \"cost push\" factors. When it begins to cost more to make an item, the price will increase. People will be less likely to invest money in the company. This will lead to more unemployment.\n1970s recession.\nThe 1973\u201375 recession or 1970s recession was a period of economic stagnation in much of the Western world during the 1970s, putting an end to the general post-World War II economic boom. It differed from many previous recessions as being a stagflation, where high unemployment coincided with high inflation. "}

It is one of the great orchestras of the world. They give concerts in the Symphony Hall, Boston. They also play every summer at the Tanglewood Festival.\nThe orchestra was started in 1881. Many of the conductors it had during its history were extremely famous, including Arthur Nikisch from 1889 to 1893, and Pierre Monteux from 1919 to 1924 who gave the orchestra a reputation for a \"French\" sound which many people think it still has today. Serge Koussevitzky was their conductor for many years and made them a world-class orchestra. With Koussevitzky, the orchestra gave radio broadcasts and made its summer home at Tanglewood, where Koussevitzky founded the Berkshire Music Center, which is now the Tanglewood Music Center.\nKoussevitzky asked many famous composers to write music for the orchestra. Works written especially for them include \"Symphony No. 4\" by Sergei Prokofiev and the \"Symphony of Psalms\" by Igor Stravinsky. They also gave the first performance of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's \"Concerto for Orchestra\". Since then many other composers have written for the orchestra including Roger Sessions, Andrzej Panufnik and Elliott Carter.\nWhen the conductor Charles Munch took over from Koussevitzky he gave the orchestra their first tour overseas. He was followed in 1962 by Erich Leinsdorf, then William Steinberg, Seiji Ozawa and, since 2004, James Levine who is the first American-born conductor of the orchestra.\nAs well as the Boston Symphony Orchestra there is also the Boston Pops Orchestra, founded in 1885, which plays light music, e.g. from show tunes. Arthur Fiedler conducted them from 1930 until 1979. He was followed by the film composer John Williams. Today their conductor is Keith Lockhart.\nA small group of principal players from the BSO form the Boston Symphony Chamber Players. They have being playing since 1964 and perform in Boston, Tanglewood and in other places in USA and Europe. They have made many recordings.\nThe Boston Symphony have made many recordings with their conductors since 1917 when they made one of the earliest music recordings conducted by Karl Muck."}

It was released in 2007. The director of the movie was G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3. It was adapted for a movie by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell. The movie is based on the Katherine Paterson novel of the same name. Walt Disney Pictures distributed the movie in the U.S.A. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of two 12-year-old neighbours, Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke. They spend their free time in an abandoned tree house where they create a fantasy world called Terabithia.\nDavid Paterson, who wrote the screenplay, is Katherine Paterson's son. The novel is based on parts of his childhood. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed. This was because he could write plays well. Production of the movie began in February 2006. The movie was shot by November. It was shot mainly in Auckland, New Zealand within two months. It took ten weeks to edit the movie. Post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took many months.\n\"Bridge to Terabithia\" was released in the US and Canada on February 16, 2007. The movie was successful in terms of earnings. With a budget of around $20 million, it collected US$137 million worldwide. The movie received positive reviews. Critics called it faithful to the children's novel. They said the visuals and performances made the movie imaginative. \"Bridge to Terabithia\" was nominated for seven awards. It won five of them at the Young Artist Awards.\nPlot.\nJesse \"Jess\" Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a fifth grader who wants to be an artist. He lives with his financially poor family in Lark Creek. He rides the bus to school with his little sister, May Belle (Bailee Madison). He avoids the school bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton). In class, his classmates, Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless) tease him. A new student his age named Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) comes to the school. At recess, Jess enters a running event, for which he had been training at home. Leslie also enters it. She manages to beat all the boys, including Jess. This irritates Jess. While going home, Jess and Leslie learn that they are next-door neighbors.\nLater in the evening, Jess becomes angry to find his sister has drawn in his notebook. His strict father (Robert Patrick) sides with her. The next day at school, Leslie praises Jess' drawing ability. This is after she sees his notebook. They soon become best friends. After school, they go into the woods. There, they swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house and a broken down truck on the other side of the creek. They invent a new world, which they call \"Terabithia\". The fantasy world reflects their lives. It comes to life as they explore the area. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house and learn about one another.\nLeslie gives Jess an art kit for his birthday. This pleases Jess very much. Later, he gives her a puppy. She names it Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll that looks like Janice Avery, the school bully. At school, May Belle shows her friend Alexandra what she has for her snack, Twinkies. Jess tells her that she should not brag about them. At recess, May Belle tells Jess and Leslie that Janice stole her Twinkies. Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice's fee for entering the toilet. Jess and Leslie play a trick on Janice. Everyone laughs at her at the bus for this.\nOnce Leslie's parents finish writing their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness and watches the family. At school on Friday, Leslie hears Janice crying in the bathroom. After Leslie talks with her, she learns that the reason why Janice is a bully is because she is abused by her father. They become friends. Jess and Leslie take Prince Terrein to Terabithia. There they fight off several creatures that look like students at their school. They decide to go home when it starts raining. The creek gets higher than ever due to the rain.\nThe next morning, Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), Jess' music teacher, invites him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission. As she is half-asleep, he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess does not ask Leslie to come with him. When he returns home, Jess finds that his father and mother are worried. This is because they did not know where he was. His father tells him that Leslie drowned in the river that morning. This happened when Jess went to the museum. Jess is very sad to hear this. He visits the Burke family home with his parents to pay their respects. Leslie's father, Bill Burke (Latham Gaines), tells Jess that she loved him. He thanks him for being a very good friend to her, since she could not make friends at her old school. Jess feels very guilty for Leslie's death. His father consoles him to keep their friendship alive for her sake. Jess decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge across the river to welcome a new ruler. He invites his sister, May Belle to enter Terabithia. She is delighted because she was not allowed to enter before. She and Jess make Terabithia even better, with Jess as king and his sister as princess.\nProduction.\nProduction for the movie began in February 2006, with a budget of around $20 million. The main photography for the movie was shot in Auckland, New Zealand in sixty days. movie editing took ten weeks. Post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The movie was finished by November 2006. This was because the crew \"had to rush\" to finish it by February 16. The movie was directed by G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3. Walden Media President Cary Granat first recommended him to direct the movie. Csup\u00f3 had never done a live-action movie before. However, he said it \"didn't worry Granat in the least\". Csup\u00f3 noted that he was interested in making the movie. He \"had the ambition to do a live-action movie for a long time\", but that he \"didn't like anything until I read this book\". He called the book \"beautiful\" and said that it \"moved [him]\". The cinematographer of \"Bridge to Terabithia\" was Michael Chapman. This was his final movie before he retired. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after the movie because he wanted his last movie to be a good one. He said: \"this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life\".\nCasting.\nDirector Csup\u00f3 stated they had thought of no actors for the movie at first. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csup\u00f3 \"such a beautiful, heartwarming letter\" that showed she loved the book and character. Csup\u00f3 said Robb was cast for the movie because of \"her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material\". Robb also talked with Lauren Levine, the producer of the movie, before casting even began. \"[T]heir conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role,\" Csup\u00f3 stated. Levine said \"it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven.\" With regard to the character, Robb said \"[Leslie]'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her.\"\nLevine noted that \"looking for Jess was a really tough hunt. We needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident, brave leader in Terabithia. That's a heck of a range for such a young actor.\" Josh Hutcherson was not their first choice for the role of Jess Aarons. He was chosen as they \"felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him\". Hutcherson said that he liked the project because of \"the real life day-to-day drama as well as the arc of the character Jess\".\nThe filmmakers cast Robert Patrick as Jess' father. He was chosen due to his experience in several movies in the past. Patrick explained that he could relate to the plot. He was \"constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid\" himself, and that the movie reminded him of the place where he grew up. He also said that he agreed to act because it was a movie his children could watch.\nBailee Madison was cast as May Belle Aarons. Csup\u00f3 said they searched for a long time for someone to play her role. She had \"such a charm, even before the camera, she was just like a little sweetheart,\" he said. She was confident, shook hands with everybody and was \"totally sweet and perky\". Csup\u00f3 was pleased by her attitude and cast her for the movie.\nDesign and effects.\nCsup\u00f3 explained that \"it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that we're not going to overdo the visual effects because of the story's integrity and the book's integrity.\" There was only a small mention of Jess and Leslie fighting creatures in Terabithia in the book. For this reason, they \"tried to do the absolute minimum, which would be required to put it into a movie version\".\nTo design the creatures of Terabithia, Csup\u00f3 wanted to use \"little more artsy, imaginative, fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies.\" He was inspired by Terry Gilliam and Ridley Scott. Dima Malanitchev drew the creatures. Csup\u00f3 helped him in this. Csup\u00f3 chose Weta Digital render the 3D animation. He \"was impressed with their artistic integrity, the teamwork, the [fact that] people were really nice, and also they responded to our designs very positively.\" Weta modified some of the creature designs. However, they mainly used Csup\u00f3's original designs.\n100 crew members from Weta worked for the movie. Weta was doing the animations when the movie was being shot. Weta crew members saw the shooting of all scenes involving these creatures. Weta's Matt Aitken said the process of animation was \"split into two steps\". First, natural-looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by Csup\u00f3 and Malanitchev. Photoshop pictures made by visual effects art director Michael Pangrazio was used for this. The second step was to use the best animation and motion style for the creatures.\nLeslie's costumes in the movie were designed to look as if the character \"might have made some of them herself\". They were updated from those described in the book. This was because the descriptions in the book would appear odd now.\nWriting.\nProducer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son. His name was featured on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill. Hill had been struck by lightning. She was killed when they were both eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel. She agreed \"not only because he's [her] son, but also because he's a very good playwright\". Paterson found it difficult to market his screenplay. It was mainly because of Leslie's death. \"[I]f you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit\u2014put her in a light coma and then bring her out\".\nPaterson said it was very important for him to keep the spirit of the book alive. At the same time, he had to change it from \"a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium\". Paterson knew that the movie had to be about friendship and imagination. He focused \"bringing out the emotions of the story.\" He said he found it difficult to write about Terabithia. This was \"because it was too close\". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the movie. \"What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn\u2019t so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way\", David said. Csup\u00f3 said that the two main characters are a little bit older in the movie. Csup\u00f3 claims the movie \"deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that\", so it \"made more sense\" to make the characters older.\nMusic.\nThe film's musical score was composed by Aaron Zigman. He was hired after Alison Krauss did not compose the music. Zigman said there are similarities between the music he made fro \"Bridge to Terabithia\" and the movie \"Flicka\". He said: \"[...]at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much\", but he also went on to say that there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for \"Bridge to Terabithia\". The score he composed for the movie is described as \"very large\" compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that \"Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this movie enabled me to spread my wings out a bit.\" The official soundtrack for the movie was released by \"Hollywood Records\" on February 13, 2007.\nRelease.\nPromotion.\nReviewers criticized the film's advertisement campaign. One critic said the movie was actually \"grounded in reality far more than in fantasy.\" Another thought, \"far from a computer generated [created] escapist fantasy, this movie is an unpretentious [not pretending] and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss\".\nDistribution.\nThe movie premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on February 16, 2007. Paterson, who studied in The Catholic University of America, held a special advance screening of the movie for them. This was shown at the AFI Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland on February 1, 2007. The movie opened in the UK on May 4, 2007, and in New Zealand June 7, 2007. The movie grossed \"a higher-than-expected\" $28,536,717 from 2,284 screens. It earned an average of $9,885 per screen. The opening day had collections of $6.3 million. The movie has a worldwide gross of US$120 million. It grossed $80 million in the US and Canada.\nThe DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released on June 19, 2007 in the US. The DVD and Blu-ray version had \"Digital Imagination: Bringing Terabithia to Life\", \"Behind the Book: The Themes of \"Bridge to Terabithia\"\" It also had \"Keep Your Mind Wide Open\" music video by Robb, and two audio commentaries. The first was with director Csup\u00f3, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer Hal Lieberman. The second was with producer Lauren Levine and actors Hutcherson and Robb.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes said 85% of 137 collected reviews for \"Bridge to Terabithia\" were positive. The average score was 7.1/10. Critics said the movie was \"a faithful adaptation of a beloved children's novel and a powerful portrayal of love, loss, and imagination through children's eyes. Dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhance the imaginative film\". At Metacritic, the movie got 74 out of 100 from 25 reviews. This meant it received \"generally favorable reviews\".\nJames Berardinelli of ReelViews called \"Bridge to Terabithia\" \"easily the best family feature of the early year\". Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" praised the script. She said it was \"utterly recognizable and authentic\", and thought Robb and Hutcherson were \"perfectly cast\". Hornaday said the final five minutes showed \"oversweet sentiment.\" Viewers would remember the film's \"warmth and respect with which it pays homage [respect] to first love,\" she added. Jessica Grose of \"The Village Voice\" praised director Csup\u00f3 for not showing \"cutesy tween [neither a child, nor a teenager] stereotypes.\" She felt Jess' relationship with his father made \"Bridge to Terabithia\" from \"a good kids movie to a classic contender\". \"The New York Times\" Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background \"to find magic in the everyday\", and thought Csup\u00f3 directed \"like someone intimate with the pain of being different, allowing each personality more than a single characteristic\". She particularly praised Deschanel and Madison. Catsoulis said the movie handled adult topics with \"with nuance [cleverly] and sensitivity\". Since it was smart and \"delicate as a spider web\", it was the kind of children's movie \"rarely seen nowadays\". Miriam di Nunzio of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" praised Hutcherson and Robb's performances. \"[T]he film's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through children's eyes. The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint,\" she noted.\nNot all reviews were positive. Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" said \"for a movie about the power of imagination, \"Bridge to Terabithia\" is not as clever as you would hope\". Puig said it was an average translation of the novel. But the adult characters were too caricatured or exaggerated in the movie. The real-life portions of the movie were \"derivative and simplistic\", but Jess' emotional feelings seemed \"powerfully authentic, and this is where the movie finds its truth and soul\". \"The Wall Street Journal\" critic Joe Morgenstern felt the movie overused fantasy. The critic added that the \"agreeable simplicity in between computer-generated monsters\". The young members of the cast were \"appealing but unpolished\". Morgenstern thought Csup\u00f3 lacked experience in direction. Although Deschanel was the best among the adults, she seemed self-directed.\nAwards and nominations.\n\"Bridge to Terabithia\" was nominated for seven awards. It won five of these. Josh Hutcherson was nominated at the 2008 Saturn Awards for \"Best Performance by a Younger Actor\". AnnaSophia Robb was nominated for a Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for \"Best Young Actress\". The film won five awards at the Young Artist Awards. This included \"Best Family Feature Film (Fantasy or Musical)\" and \"Best Performance in a Feature Film\u00a0\u2013 Leading Young Actor\" for Hutcherson. Robb won \"Best Performance in a Feature Film\u00a0\u2013 Leading Young Actress\", and Bailee Madison won \"Best Performance in a Feature Film\u00a0\u2013 Young Actress Age Ten or Younger\". The cast also won the award for \"Best Performance in a Feature Film\u00a0\u2013 Young Ensemble Cast\". The cast included Hutcherson, Robb, Madison, Wakefield, Clinton, Lawless, Isabelle Rose Kircher, Carly Owen, Devon Wood, Emma Fenton and Grace Brannigan."}

Earth is the \"original\" terrestrial planet. When astronomers started understanding the kinds of planet they extended the term to include our nearest rocky neighbours: Mercury, Venus and Mars. \nIt is often said that they are similar to Earth. This is true of most of the structure and composition, but not the surface or the atmosphere. A terrestrial planet may be much hotter or colder than Earth, and may have much more or much less atmosphere. \nWith the discovery of planets orbiting other stars (exoplanets), the term terrestrial planet has been extended again to any rocky (silicate) planet orbiting any star.\nStructure.\nAll terrestrial planets have a core, a mantle, and a crust. They are a bit like a boiled egg: the central yolk is the core; the white albumin is the mantle; and the shell is the crust. The crust of a terrestrial planet is thin, with the core and the mantle taking up the vast bulk, sometimes with a very large core, sometimes much smaller. Terrestrial planets have metallic cores of mostly iron, with rocky mantles and crusts. \nAll terrestrial planets have the same type of structure: a central metallic core, mostly iron, with a surrounding silicate mantle. \nThe Moon is similar, but has a much smaller iron core. Io and Europa are also satellites that have internal structures similar to that of terrestrial planets. Terrestrial planets can have canyons, craters, mountains, volcanoes, and other surface structures, depending on the presence of water and tectonic activity. Terrestrial planets have \"secondary atmospheres\", got from volcanism, meteorites, and photosynthesis. In the giant planets, their atmospheres are \"primary\", captured directly from the original solar nebula."}

Mania is usually a symptom of a medical problem or a mental illness. A person with mania is described as manic.\nWhen people are manic, they usually have much more energy than usual. They often have very strong emotions, and their moods may change very quickly.\nThe word \"mania\" comes from the Greek language (\"\u03bcwords\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\" means \"mania\"). That word comes from \"\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\" (\"mainomai)\", which means \"to rage\" or \"to be furious\" (very angry).\nMania is a symptom, not an illness by itself. Many different things can cause mania. These things include illegal drugs and brain tumors. However, most of the time, mania happens in people with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder causes periods of mania that switch off with periods of depression.\nLike with other symptoms, mania can be mild (not very bad), severe (very bad), or anywhere in between. Mild mania is usually called \"hypomania.\" Very bad mania can cause psychosis, with hallucinations and delusions.\nIn some cases, people with mania may need to be hospitalized so they do not hurt themselves or other people. On the other hand, many people with mania and hypomania have special creativity and artistic talents.\nSymptoms.\nThe most common symptoms of mania are:\nOther symptoms of mania can include:\nOfficial diagnosis (DSM-5).\nIn the United States, a book called \"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association, is used to diagnose mental illnesses. According to the latest version of the DSM, the DSM-5, a person is having a \"manic episode\" if all of these things are true:\nIn addition, the person must also have three or more of these symptoms:\nOfficial diagnosis (ICD-10).\nThe ICD-10 is the World Health Organization's system for classifying health problems. It describes a manic episode this way:\nCauses.\nMental illness\nMania is usually a symptom of mental illness, most often bipolar disorder. A diagnosis of type I bipolar disorder (bipolar I disorder) can be made based on a single manic episode. This is the most common cause of mania.\nHowever, if a person is hypomanic, they may have type II bipolar disorder or cyclothymia.\nAlso, if a person has psychosis that lasts longer than their mania, they may have schizoaffective disorder.\nMedical causes\nMania is usually caused by a mental illness. However, some medical illnesses can cause symptoms of mania. Some doctors use the mnemonic E-MANIC to remember the possible medical causes of mania:\nNot having enough vitamin B-12 (vitamin B-12 deficiency) can also cause mania and psychosis.\nMedical treatment.\nIf mania is caused by a medical problem, the best thing to do is to treat that medical problem.\nIf mania is caused by a mental illness, the best treatment is a combination of medicines and psychotherapy (talking with a therapist or counselor).\nDoctors usually treat mania with a combination of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medicines. While taking these medicines, the patient should see their doctor regularly to be checked for side effects. \nWhen the symptoms of mania have ended, long-term treatment then focuses on preventative treatment. The goal of this kind of treatment is to prevent periods of mania or depression from happening. Very often, this is done using a combination of drugs and psychotherapy. Medication works best for bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses, when it is combined with other treatments like psychotherapy."}

{"id": "178812", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178812", "title": "Andrea del Verrocchio", "text": " \nAndrea del Verrocchio (c. 1435 \u2013 1488), born Andrea di Michele di Francesco de' Cioni, was an Italian sculptor, goldsmith and painter. He had an important workshop in Florence. Many other Renaissance painters were Verrocchio's apprentices or worked in his workshop. These included Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino. Verrocchio's most famous apprentice was Leonardo da Vinci. \nVerrocchio was born in Florence in 1435. His father was Michele di Francesco Cioni who was not married to Verrocchio's mother. Michele made tiles and bricks. Later he worked as a tax collector. He worked for the Medici family of bankers, then he moved to Venice. \nWhen Verrocchio was born, he was named Andrea di Francesco di Cioni. His name was changed to Andrea del Verrocchio when he was apprenticed to a goldsmith called Verrocchio (who was probably Francesco di Luca Verrocchio, who was very rich and successful). As an apprentice to a goldsmith, Verrocchio learnt how to make jewellery and golden tableware such as plates, dishes, jugs and salt containers. He learnt how to hammer gold into thin sheets called \"gold leaf\" and use it to decorate picture frames, statues and illuminated manuscripts. He also learnt how to make bronze statues. Verrocchio's bronze statues are his most famous works. \nAt this time Verrocchio met Donatello. Donatello became one of the most famous sculptors ever. He made many more statues than Verrocchio. However, Donatello and Verrocchio both made a statue of David with the head of Goliath, and both made a huge statue of a famous soldier on horseback (equestrian statue). Art historians often compare the two Davids and the two equestrian statues. \nPaintings.\nIt is thought that Verrocchio began painting in the 1460s, when he worked at Prato with the painter Fra Filippo Lippi. There is only one known painting that was signed by Verrocchio. This is an altarpiece of the \"Madonna and Child with Saints\" in the Cathedral of Pistoia, painted in the late 1470s. There are several more paintings from Verrocchio's studio. They have probably been painted partly by Verrocchio and partly by his students. \nThe most famous of these paintings was done between 1472 and 1475. It is a \"Baptism of Christ\". Giorgio Vasari writing in his book \"Lives of the Great Artists\" says that the angel on the left was painted by Leonardo da Vinci. Vasari says that when Verrocchio saw how beautifully the eighteen-year-old apprentice could paint, he put down his brush and never painted again. On close examination, it can be seen that most of the painting is painted in old-fashioned tempera, but the angel, parts of Jesus' body, and the background landscape have been painted in the new technique of oil painting. This makes art historians think that Leonardo worked on many parts of this picture. It has also been suggested that Botticelli painted the second angel.\nSculpture.\nVerrochio made two large beautiful things out of stone, a coffin and a wash basin. He is thought to have also carved a Madonna and Child in low relief (an almost-flat stone picture). \nVerrocchio's most famous sculptures are made in bronze which is a sort of metal. To make a bronze statue, Verrocchio made the statue in wax. Then plaster was put over the wax, and the wax was removed, leaving a mould. The metal was heated over a furnace until it melted and became molten (liquid). The molten metal was poured into the mould and slowly allowed to cool. When the plaster was chipped away, the bronze statue was inside. The statue then needed to be finished and polished.\nWork at San Lorenzo.\nThe Church of San Lorenzo (St Lawrence) was a new church in Florence. It was built by the architect Brunelleschi in the new style of the Renaissance. The Medici family were the most important patrons of this church. The family chose Verrocchio as the sculptor to make three works for San Lorenzo. \nIn 1465 Verrocchio made a wash basin for the room of San Lorenzo's where the robes and Communion vessels were kept. (It is now called the \"Old Sacristy\".) Above the basin is carved an eagle, the symbol of St John the Evangelist. On the bowl of the basin is carved the Medici coat of arms. Verrocchio then had to design a tomb for Cosimo, the famous banker, and grandfather of the Medici family. \nIn the early 1470s Lorenzo de' Medici gave him the job of designing the tomb of Lorenzo's father Piero and uncle Giovanni. The tomb that Verrocchio designed was very unusual. He made a large \"sarcophagus\" (stone coffin) out of beautiful dark red stone, trimmed with green stone and sculptured leaves of bronze. Instead of being placed against a wall in the usual way, the tomb was designed to stand in an archway leading into the Sacristy. Verrocchio designed a net that looks as if it is made of rope, but is made of bronze. This network makes a screen in the archway, so that people who look at the tomb can see through into the sacristy.\n\"Christ and St Thomas\".\nThe most unusual church in Florence is Orsanmichele. This building is an ancient corn-market that had, painted on the wall, a precious image of the \"Madonna and Child\". The corn-market was turned into a church, and the sides of the building, which used to be open, were given walls. The walls had \"niches\" which is a hollow that a statue can stand in. The niches were big enough for life-sized statues. Many people worked at different jobs in the city of Florence. The people of different jobs belonged to organisations called \"guilds\". Every important guild in the city wanted to have a statue of their patron saint in a niche at Orsanmichele Church. The statues were made by some of the finest sculptors of Florence. \nIn 1466 the Guild of Traders gave Verrocchio the job of making a bronze statue of their saint, St Thomas. Verrocchio made a group of two figures which shows the most important moment in the story of St Thomas. At the back of the niche stands the figure of Jesus, raising one hand to Heaven. St Thomas stands at the edge of the niche, looking at Jesus in amazement and reaching out his hand to touch the spear-wound in Jesus' side. Verrocchio's statue was admired for the way in which he had fitted the two figures into the space, and the way in which he had told the story. \nAt about this time Verrocchio also made a huge brass candlestick for the Palazzo Vecchio (the town hall). This candlestick is now in Amsterdam. \n\"David\".\nIn the 1470s, Lorenzo Medici and his brother Giuliano gave Verrocchio the job of making a statue of David. David, a shepherd boy in a story from the Bible, had killed the giant, Goliath. He was one of the patrons of the city. Nowadays there are at least eight statues of David in Florence, the most famous one being by Michelangelo. \nWhen Verrocchio made his statue, the most famous \"David\" in Florence was a life-sized bronze statue by Donatello. This statue shows David naked, except for his boots and hat. The figure stands gracefully, looking down at the giant head at his feet. It looks very much like an Ancient Greek statue. Verrochio's statue of David is very different, even though it is a similar size and is also made of bronze. \nVerrocchio's statue looks like a real-live boy, dressed in modern parade clothes. He does not stand elegantly. His muscles are all drawn tight. He grips the handle of the sword so tightly that the sinews of his arm stand out. The muscles of his face are pulled into the silly grin that people sometimes get when they are very frightened. Verrocchio's David has just killed the giant, but now he is facing the whole enemy army and wondering what will happen next. The handsome boy that Verrocchio used as his model for David is believed to have been Leonardo da Vinci. \nThe Medici also gave Verrocchio the job of making a bronze statue of a \"Cherub with a Dolphin\" to go in the fountain of their home in the countryside. The statue now stands in the small courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.\nBartolomeo Colleoni.\nIn 1478 Verrocchio began work on his most famous statue. It is a \"equestrian statue\", a statue of a man on horseback. The statue was made for the Republic of Venice in memory of a famous soldier who had lead military troops many times when Venice was at war. His name was Bartolomeo Colleoni, and he had died in 1475. Colleoni was admired by many people who thought he was a good man, as well as a brave soldier and great military leader. Colleoni left a message to say that he wanted a statue of himself in the main square of Venice, right opposite St Mark's Basilica. The town council would not allow this. The statue was put in another important square, near the Hospital of St Mark and the Church of two Roman soldier-saints, St Giovanni and St Paolo. \nWhen Verrocchio started making this statue, there had been only one big equestrian monument made in more than a thousand years. Donatello had made an equestrian statue of another soldier, who was nicknamed Gattamelata (\"the Smug Cat\"). Verrocchio must have looked at Donatello's statue, which was in Padua and at the four ancient bronze horses that stood high on the front of St Mark's Basilica. Verrocchio decided to make his horse do something which the St Mark's horses do, but Donatello's horse does not do. The horses at St Marks all have one front hoof raised, so that they are perfectly balanced on only three legs. \nVerrocchio's horse looks as if it is moving forward quite fast. It is full of action. The figure of Colleoni is not sitting down in the saddle, he is standing in the stirups, as if he is looking out to spot the enemy. The horse's head turns one way, and the body and face of Colleoni turns the other way. Colleoni looks fierce, as if he is leading his troops into battle. The statue is very lively and very lifelike. \nVerrocchio moved from Florence to Venice in 1488, to help with the casting of the bronze statue. But he died that year, and never saw his most famous work finished."}

In the 1760s and 1770s, the British set up a town at Port Egmont, which nearly led to a war with Spain who had a town at Port Louis. Then Argentina became a separate country from Spain in 1817 and set up a colony on the islands (which they call \"Malvinas\") in 1820.

The word \"macropus\" means \"big foot\" and \"rufus\" means red. It is the largest mammal in Australia, and the largest marsupial in the world. It lives in the arid open areas of Australia which covers much of the country. It is not found in the south, on the east coast, or in the northern rainforests. \nDescription.\nThe red kangaroo is a very large kangaroo. The fur is short, red to brown in colour, fading to a pale colour below and on the legs. Females are smaller than males and are a blue-grey colour with a small amount of brown, pale grey below, although arid area females are coloured like males. The kangaroo has long, pointed ears and a squared-off nose. The kangaroo has two front legs with small claws. It has two strong back legs, which are used for jumping, and a strong tail which is often used for balance when standing upright. The tail is also used as a fifth leg when walking slowly.\nThe males can jump a distance of in one leap.\nMales grow up to tall and weigh up to . Females are tall and weigh up to . The tails is about long. There are often reports of larger red kangaroos, with some males reaching about tall.\nThe red kangaroo is able to keep its body cool (36\u00a0\u00b0C, 96.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in a hot climate. Its fur acts to insulate the body and during the heat of the day the kangaroo will rest and stay in the shade. It also control its temperature by panting (breathing hard), sweating and licking its front legs.\nThe red kangaroo's range of vision is about 300\u00b0 because of the position of its eyes. (A human's range of vision is about 180\u00b0).\nBehaviour.\nThe red kangaroo is nocturnal and crepuscular, and spends the day sleeping or resting in the shade. It is active in the cool of the evening and at dawn. It lives alone or in small groups called 'mobs'. Membership of these groups often changes, and males are not territorial. The largest males control most of the matings and chase off other males.\nFeeding.\nThe Red Kangaroo eats grasses and other vegetation. It can go without water, as they are able to get enough moisture out of plants.\nBreeding.\nThe red kangaroo breeds all year round. The gestation period is around 33 days. The females are also able to delay birth of their baby until their previous joey has left the pouch. The young joey leaves the pouch at around 235 days old, but will continue to suckle until it reaches 1 year of age.\nFighting.\nWhen male kangaroos fight, they look like they are \"boxing\". They usually stand up on their back legs and attempt to push the other off balance by jabbing him or locking front legs. Using their tail to support their weight, they can also kick with their powerful back legs.\nCommercial use.\nThe red kangaroo is hunted in large numbers in Australia. In the year 2000, 1,173,242 animals were killed. In 2009 the government put a limit of 1,611,204 for the number of red kangaroos available for commercial use. The kangaroo industry is worth about AU$270 million each year, and employs over 4000 people.\nThe kangaroos provide meat for both humans and pet food. Kangaroo meat is very lean with only about 2% fat. Their skins are used for leather, and makes the lightest and strongest leather. Around the world, nearly all professional soccer players wear boots made from kangaroo leather."}

{"id": "178841", "revid": "1072068", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178841", "title": "BDSM", "text": "BDSM is an initialism for bondage/discipline (\"BD\"), dominance/submission (\"DS\"), and sadism/masochism (\"SM\"). It means some kinds of sex play, sometimes these are called kink or fetish. They all have to do with trying to get sexual pleasure out of things that are often painful or upsetting. People try to do this in a safe way by agreeing on a \"safe word\". If someone says this word the whole play stops. This is to stop the play from going too far and causing real physical or emotional hurt.\nBDSM and safety.\nEngaging in BDSM is riskier than practicing sex without the BDSM elements (often called \"vanilla sex\"). People doing BDSM follow a number of rules. People enganging in BDSM derive pleasure from either inflicting or receiving pain. They also do not want to give the impression that sex and violence are linked.\nBefore people engange in BDSM, they usually talk about each of the partner's wishes and fears. They also talk about the things that they are going to do, and the order in which they are done. Such detailed conversations are common. As people get to know each other better, these conversations become more informal. In addition, partitipants usually agree on a \"safe word\"; with this safe word, the action has to stop immediately. Safe words are used to make sure BDSM is safe. Sometimes one person thinks they are playing in an ok way, but the other person does not. The person who does not think the play is ok will use a safe word or gesture to stop playing. This means that the play must stop, so nobody gets hurt or injured.\nWhat is also seen as a way of safety, is that after the session, the \"top\" is caring for the \"bottom\". The actions may have released hormones, and it may take minutes to hours for the bottom to return to a normal state. It is seen as a duty of the top to care for the bottom in this phase. This also applies when sessions are interrupted.\nBondage and discipline.\nBondage is the use of items like handcuffs, ropes or chains to keep a willing person from moving. Bondage often has to do with sex, but not always. Bondage is done because some people like the feeling of being not able to move while having sex. In this case, bondage sometimes has to do with BDSM, as often in the case of rope bondage and bondage of the female breasts. The letter \"B\" in BDSM stands for \"bondage\". Bondage may also be done just because people may like the feelings it creates.\nSome couples include bondage as foreplay in their otherwise traditional sex lives at some time during their relationship. These bedroom bondage games are often with one partner willingly being restrained with rope or cuffs. Sometimes they can also be blindfolded or gagged.\nDominance and submission.\nDomination and submission is a lifestyle. Often it is seen as a form of erotic play. Usually two people do this. With this lifestyle or context, one of the two people has the dominant role. He or she can tell the other (called submissive) to do things. The submissive has to obey. The roles are usually agreed on beforehand. The submission is voluntary. Sadomasochism may be seen as a variation of domination and submission. A person who plays both roles is called a switch."}

These diseases were formerly known as preleukemia, mostly because sometimes they can lead to leukemia. Often, its name is shortened to MDS. \nMyelodysplastic syndromes affect the bone marrow stem cells. The production of blood does not rely on good stem cells, but ones that have been modified genetically. This means that the production of red blood cells, sometimes of white blood cells and blood platelets changed. The production becomes inefficient, or goes wrong altogether. Most of the time, this manifests in anemia - not having enough blood. Depending on the severity of the condition, it can also cause hemorrhages and infections with fever.\nMost of the people who have these conditions are 60 years or older, but younger people can get it too, especially if they went through a form of chemotherapy. Most of the suffers die from the disease, usually after six to thirty months. The only known cure is a stem cell transplant. About a third of those suffering contract leukemia within a few months to a few years. "}

In adults, the bone marrow in large bones makes new blood cells. Bone marrow makes up about 4% of an adult human's weight (about 2.6 kilograms).\nMarrow types.\nThere are two types of bone marrow. Red marrow is made mostly of myeloid tissue (which makes new blood cells). Red blood cells, platelets, and most white blood cells are created by red marrow. Yellow marrow is made mainly of fat cells. Both types of bone marrow contain many blood vessels and capillaries.\nWhen a person is born, all of their bone marrow is red. As the person ages, more and more of the bone marrow changes to the yellow type. By adulthood, about half of a person's bone marrow is red.\nRed marrow is found mainly in the flat bones - like the hip bone, breast bone, skull, ribs, vertebra (the bones that make up the spinal column), and shoulder blades - and in the cancellous (\"spongy\") material at the ends of the long bones like the femur (thigh bone) and humerus (upper forearm bone). Yellow marrow is found inside the hollow middle section, or medullary cavity of the long bones.\nIn cases of severe blood loss, the body can change yellow marrow back to red marrow so that more blood cells are made to replace the lost blood."}

For instance, mature tissues like skin, muscle, blood, bone, liver, nerves, all have different types of cells. Because stem cells are not yet differentiated, they can change to become some kind of specialized cells. Organisms also use stem cells to replace damaged cells.\nStem cells are found in most, if not all, plants and animals. They divide and differentiate into a range of cell types.Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings in the 1960s.\nThe two broad types of mammalian stem cells are embryonic stem cells, and adult stem cells, which are found in adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into \"all\" of the specialised embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of blood, skin, and intestinal tissues.\nStem cells can be grown in tissue culture. In culture, they can be transformed into specialised cells, such as those of muscles or nerves. Highly plastic adult stem cells can be taken from a variety of sources, including umbilical cord blood and bone marrow. They are now used in medical therapies, and researchers expect that stem cells will be used in many future therapies.\nEmbryonic stem cells.\nEmbryonic stem cells (ES cells) are stem cells taken from the inner cell mass of the early stage embryo called a \"blastocyst\". Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4-5 days after fertilization. At that time, they are made up of between 50 and 150 cells. \nThe stem cells' state, and what the daughter cells turn into, is influenced by signals from other cells in the embryo.\nAdult stem cells.\nAdult stem cells exist throughout body after embryonic development has completed. They are found inside different types of tissue and remain in a \"non-dividing state\" until disease or tissue injury. They have changed permanently into specialised cells and have lost the ability to divide and specialise further. An advantage of adult stem cells is that it provides a lesser probability of rejection. A disadvantage would be that there is a limited availability to get them.\nPlant stem cells.\nPlant stem cells are unspecialised, and can develop into any type of plant cell. They become specialised into cells of roots, leaves or flowers. The stem cells are found in meristem, at root and stem apices. They make it possible for growth to continue. \nCloning plants.\nThese are plants which have been grown from cuttings (therefore the same plant). They are dipped in \"hormone rooting powder\" to develop bigger root systems. They turn into tissues (eg. xylem and phloem) and organs (eg. roots, leaves and flowers), therefore becoming a completely new plant. \nCloning plants is a cheap way of producing a new plant.\nStem cells in medicine.\nSome cancers \"may\" be treated by stem cells. Leukemia, a cancer of white blood cells (WBC) is an example. \nThere are two stages to this process:"}

Then the people of San Francisco managed to get funding for the orchestra so that they could carry on.\nThe famous French conductor Pierre Monteux was asked to come and get the orchestra back to a good standard. He was very successful and the orchestra were soon offered more recordings. In 1949, Monteux invited Arthur Fiedler to lead summer \"pops\" concerts in the Civic Auditorium. Fiedler worked with the orchestra until the mid 1970s.\nWhen Monteux left the orchestra in 1952, several conductors led the orchestra, including Leopold Stokowski, Georg Solti, Erich Leinsdorf, Karl M\u00fcnchinger, George Szell, Bruno Walter, Ferenc Fricsay, and William Steinberg.\nTwo years later the young Spanish conductor Enrique Jord\u00e1 became their music director. At first things went well. He had a lot of energy, and sometimes his baton flew out of his hand as he conducted. Gradually the orchestra became less happy with Jord\u00e1 who did not seem to be able to control the orchestra and did not rehearse them properly. Eventually, after George Szell, the conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, criticized him, the orchestra got rid of him.\nIn 1963, the Austrian conductor Josef Krips became music director. He was very strict and rehearsed them in great detail. He started a tradition of playing a special concert every New Year's Eve, \"A Night in Old Vienna.\" with music by Johann Strauss and other 19th century Viennese composers. The Japanese Seiji Ozawa was their next conductor. He gave very exciting concerts which were always sold out. They made many recordings together. He sometimes conducted operas and ballets which were partly acted, and he used university choirs for choral works.\nOzawa was followed by Edo de Waart, the young Dutch conductor. He did not show off like Ozawa had done, but he kept the standard of the orchestra very high. He conducted the orchestra's very first performances in the Davies Symphony Hall. The orchestra used the huge new organ in the Hall for works such as Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Third Symphony. In de Waart's final season, 1984-85, there were four sold-out performances of Mahler's hugh Eighth Symphony with the Symphony Chorus, the Masterworks Chorale, the San Francisco Boys Chorus, and the San Francisco Girls Chorus.\nThe orchestra started to do world tours under their next conductor Herbert Blomstedt who improved the orchestra\u2019s sound. He is still an honorary conductor (Conductor Laureate).\nMichael Tilson Thomas became music director in 1995. He had conducted the London Symphony Orchestra and had guest conducted the SFSO in 1974. He made sure the orchestra played more American music as well as plenty of Russian music. The standard of orchestral playing continues to be excellent today."}

They give concerts every year from October until June at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and a summer season at the Hollywood Bowl from July to September. Their conductor is Gustavo Dudamel.\nThe orchestra are world famous, and well known for playing a lot of music written by modern composers.\nHistory.\nThe orchestra was started in 1919 by William Andrews Clark. He was a business man who had a lot of money and he paid the orchestra himself. They gave their first concert eleven days after their first rehearsal. Clark played the violin himself and sometimes played with the second violin section. Their conductor was Walter Henry Rothwell. After he died several other conductors led the orchestra, including Georg Schn\u00e9evoigt and Artur Rodzi\u0144ski.\nThe famous conductor Otto Klemperer led the orchestra in 1933. He was one of many German emigrants fleeing from Nazi Germany. He gave many new orchestral pieces their first performance, and introduced the audience to the music of Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg. The orchestra played well for him, but Klemperer had health problems and suffered from manic depression.\nWilliam Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. A new orchestra called the Southern California Symphony Association was started to try to keep the concerts going. Then a businessman called Harvey Mudd offered to pay Klemperer\u2019s salary, and the orchestra started to earn more money playing in the Hollywood Bowl.\nso they managed to keep going during the Great Depression.\nAfter the 1939 Klemperer left because of serious health problems. Four years later he was followed by Alfred Wallenstein. Wallenstein had been the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic and had then been the youngest member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic when it was founded in 1919. Arturo Toscanini had encouraged him to become a conductor. He had conducted the LA Phil several times. During his years as conductor of the LAPhil Wallenstein recorded several concertos with famous soloists such as Jascha Heifetz.\nBy the mid-1950s the rich business woman Dorothy Buffum Chandler was funding the orchestra. They were looking for a really good conductor to be their musical director. They had hoped to get Eduard van Beinum, but he suddenly died. Then Georg Solti agreed to come for three years. He was going to begin officially in 1962 but then he resigned because he had not been consulted when the orchestra had appointed Zubin Mehta as assistant conductor. So Zubin Mehta became musical director.\nIn 1969 Ernest Fleischmann became the manager of the orchestra. He had some new ideas, including starting the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group. Both these groups had musicians from the large symphony orchestra in them. It gave the musicians a change to play different sorts of music. Other orchestras in the world gradually copied this idea.\nWhen Zubin Mehta left to go to the New York Philharmonic in 1978, Carlo Maria Giulini took over as Music Director. Giulini left when his wife became ill and went back to Italy. Andr\u00e9 Previn was the next conductor. He was a good conductor, but he had some arguments with Fleischmann and so he resigned in 1989 and Esa-Pekka Salonen took over. He has conducted every season since then.\nAt the beginning of Salonen's time with the orchestra they gave regular performances at the Salzburg Festival and they played for a production of the opera \"Saint-Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise\" by Olivier Messiaen. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and conducted regularly at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, the BBC Proms in London, in Cologne for a festival of Salonen's own works, and, in 1996, in Paris for a Stravinsky festival conducted by Salonen and Pierre Boulez. \nToday the orchestra play in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\nSalonen left the LAPhilharmonia in 2009. Their conductor is now Gustavo Dudamel."}

He was born in Salem, Massachusetts. His first novel \"Fanshawe\" was published anonymously in 1828. Some short stories were published in 1837 as \"Twice-Told Tales\". He married Sophia Peabody in 1842. They had three children. The family moved about Massachusetts for a few years, but finally settled in Concord, Massachusetts. \"The Scarlet Letter\" was published in 1850. \"The House of the Seven Gables\" was published in 1851. A political appointment sent Hawthorne and his family to Europe. They returned to Massachusetts in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864.\nHawthorne's works belong to the cultural movement called romanticism. His novels and short stories are cautionary tales. They suggest that guilt, sin, and evil are the most inherent natural qualities of humanity. Many of his works are inspired by Puritan New England. They combine historical romance loaded with symbolism and deep psychological themes. They border upon surrealism. His depictions of the past are a version of historical fiction used only as a vehicle to express common themes of ancestral sin, guilt and retribution.\nEarly life.\nHawthorne, a famous short story author, whose childhood was not very good. But many people believe that he was lucky, because he had a wealthy uncle. Hawthorne had two sisters, he was the only son in his family. His father died because of yellow fever when he was four years old. Only his mom took care of him and his sisters. However, Hawthorne\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, had a wealthy brother, so after Hawthorne\u2019s father died, they lived with Elizabeth\u2019s brother. Because of Hawthorne\u2019s wealthy uncle, he attended a very good college, Bowdoin College. During his college time, Hawthorne met and befriended Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and future-president Franklin Pierce. Hawthorne started to write novels during the time that he came back home after he finished college. He published his first work in 1828.\nInfluence on society.\nHawthorne\u2019s books are still very popular now, as many students are still reading his books today. Hawthorne\u2019s books are very useful in education. As his books reflect many dark parts in American History, they are very good sources to help people learn about history. Also, his books were the very good examples of the Romantic Era of literature.\nEnd of Life.\nHawthorne's mother died in 1848 and he became very sad. \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d was written down when he was in this condition. In 1851, Hawthorne\u2019s last daughter, Rose was born. Hawthorne had three children, one son, and two daughters. In 1853, President Franklin Pierce gave Hawthorne a political appointment as U.S. Consul in Liverpool, but in 1857, Hawthorne lost this position. Before Hawthorne died, he published his last works, \u201cOur Old Home \u201c and \u201cThe Marble Faun\u201d. On May 19, 1864, Hawthorne died in Plymouth, Massachusetts."}

It is 25 miles north-west of London. The town is off the M1 motorway, 20 minutes drive from Luton Airport and 40 minutes from London itself.\nHistory.\nThe town began as an Anglo Saxon village where two river valleys met in the Chiltern Hills. The local area grew very good grain. By Tudor times, the village became a market where grain and straw were sold. The town also had many water mills to grind the grain. Local people also earned money by plaiting the straw to be made into hats.\nFrom about 1800, the town changed as the Industrial revolution took place. It is on the shortest route between London and the Birmingham. As trade between these two cities increased, a canal and a railway were built that passed very close to the town. Some of its water mills were changed from grinding grain to places where paper was made by machine. Some of these grew into giant paper making factories.\nAfter the Second World War, the government in London wanted to build many new homes for people who had had their homes destroyed by bombs in the war. It decided to build some new towns where houses could be built in an very good environment. Hemel Hempstead was chosen to be one of these towns. Many new districts were built during the 1950s and 1960s all around the old town of Hemel Hempstead. It grew into a middle size town of over 80,000 people.\nMany new industries came to the town helped by money from the government and because it is where important motorways cross each other.\nHemel Hempstead became world famous for a brief time in 2005 when an oil depot in the town at Buncefield exploded. It caused a big toxic smoke cloud to cover all the surrounding areas. Millions of pounds in damage was done, but no one was killed."}

The energy makes the material around the spot move very quickly, and very hard. This is a special type of vibration, and it is very strong.\nThe shock wave can be so powerful that it can knock things over. For example, bombs create shock waves. A shock wave can be destructive because it vibrates the material around the point in an extremely hard and fast wave, which causes other things that the material touches to vibrate too, and even make them explode. Shock waves make bombs more dangerous and sometimes are the most dangerous part of an explosion. However, the shock wave moves much faster than the rest of the bomb's energy and fades away quickly. It is called a shock \"wave\", and not simply a shock, because the force goes up and down, like an ocean wave.\nA shock wave can move through any material. An earthquake is a shockwave traveling through the ground. Shock waves can also be felt in the water. A shock wave is affected by the materials it travels through, and different materials have different effects. A thick material, like water, might help the shock wave travel further, whereas a thin material, like air, would not. This is similar to the way that sound waves are affected by what they move through, but sound waves and shock waves are not the same.\nA sound wave is similar to a shock wave in the way it looks, but the two are not the same. While a sound wave can be described as the ripples created when you drop a small rock in a bucket of water, a shock wave is faster and not as smooth. If you were to draw a picture of a perfect sound wave, it would be a smooth line, up and down by the same amount. If you were to draw a picture of a shock wave, it would be like many big bumps on a road - the line goes up very quickly, but it does not go down as much. Some of the words people use to talk about sound waves and shock waves are the same, like amplitude or frequency, but this does not mean that they are the same."}

It is caught in the water currents. It formed because currents near the center of the Northern Pacific Ocean move around in a kind of circle, which catches and holds floating pieces of plastic.\nLocation.\nThe \"Yellowwood Island\" actually has two areas, described as an eastern patch and a western patch, which are separated because of ocean currents. Scientists estimate that the size of the \"plastic island\" is approximately equal to the land area of Texas, United States, but it could be as much as twice the size. Also, it is not really a floating island. It is more like a soup of plastic pieces floating in the ocean just below the surface. It is from California, between Hawaii and Japan.\nHazards.\nShips try to avoid this patch of garbage because it can get caught in their screws. \nMany birds, turtles, and other sea animals go to Pacific Islands to lay their eggs and raise their young. Unfortunately, they eat the smaller pieces of plastic, thinking that they are food swimming in the ocean. They also get caught in the garbage. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that the plastic soup causes the death of one million sea birds and 10,000 sea animals every year. Some micro-invertebrates have also been found to eat tiny pieces of plastic with similar results.\nComposition.\nFor a long time, people thought the garbage patch was mostly plastic that had been used by ordinary people, like plastic straws and forks. In 2018, scientists found out that most of the plastic in the patch was lost fishing nets and other fishing tools used on large fishing boats.\nSince the plastics are organic compounds, they tend to absorb other organic compounds, such as pesticides. Scientists have discovered high levels of DDT and other organic compounds in this deadly plastic soup.\nSources.\nThe pieces of plastic come from all over the world. Any country that has a shore or river, where such pieces blow or wash out to sea is a source. Scientists estimate that the United States and other industrial countries contribute less garbage to the plastic island due to modern garbage disposal; but such countries also produce and sell much of the plastic that becomes garbage for non-industrial countries. \nChanges.\nChanging winds and currents often cause parts of this plastic island to break away and send pieces of plastic toward the beaches and shorelines of Pacific Islands and the continents. It's considered a major problem for tourism, and because of the problems that it causes the island and ocean environments.\nThis is a world wide environmental problem.\nCleanup.\nIn April 2008, Richard Sundance Owen, a building contractor and scuba dive instructor, started the Environmental Cleanup Coalition to solve the problem of the pollution in the North Pacific. They are working with other groups to find ways to safely remove plastic and organic compounds from the oceans. \nProject Kaisei is a project to study and clean up the garbage patch launched in March 2009. In August 2009 two ships from the project, the RV New Horizon and the Kaisei, went to research the patch and decide the possibility of a commercial scale collection and recycling operation."}

The Kindle is designed by Lab126, a part of the Amazon.com company. The first Kindles were sold in the United States on November 19, 2007. Six hardware devices, known as \"Kindle\", \"Kindle 2\", \"Kindle 3\", \"Kindle 4\", \"Kindle Touch\", and \"Kindle Fire\" support this platform. There are also software versions of Kindle than can be used on smartphones and computers.\nThe hardware Kindles (except for the Kindle Fire) use an electronic paper display and download books and websites over Amazon Whispernet using the Sprint Nextel EVDO network. A Wireless network can also be used. Kindles can be used without a computer, and Whispernet is accessible without any fee. These devices also provide free internet access to Wikipedia.\nOriginal Kindle.\nUpon the initial launch of the Kindle, Amazon's Kindle Store had more than 88,000 digital books available for download, with the number of books increasing. Amazon's first offering of Kindle sold out in five and a half hours and the device remained out of stock until late April 2008.\nThe Kindle retailed for $399; Amazon subsequently lowered the price to $359. Amazon does not sell the Kindle outside the United States as Whispernet only works in the U.S. Plans for a launch in the UK and other European countries are being delayed by problems with signing up suitable Wi-Fi operators. The CDMA technology in the Kindle does not allow for its use in the UK due to the lack of a CDMA network operator in the UK.\nThe internal memory of the Amazon Kindle can hold approximately 200 books without pictures, and the memory is expandable with a memory card.\nA reviewer from CNET expressed concern with the presentation of the device despite its comfortable design. The picture to the left displays a distinctly beige colored device. In point of fact, both Kindle versions are a matte bright white with all button labels and text colored gray. The Kindle 1 is exactly the same color as the Kindle 2 pictured in the upper right-hand corner of this page.\nKindle 2.\nOn February 9, 2009, Amazon announced the Kindle 2, which became available for purchase on February 23, 2009 for the price of $359, and lowered on July 8, 2009 for $299. The new Kindle features improved battery life, 20 percent faster page-refreshing, a text-to-speech option to read the text out loud, and overall thickness reduced from 0.8 to 0.36 inches (9.1 millimetres). The Kindle 2 has 2 GB of internal memory. Amazon estimates that the Kindle 2 will hold about 1500 books. Unlike the original Kindle, Kindle 2 does not have a slot for memory cards. To promote the new Kindle, author Stephen King has made his new book named \"UR\" only available through Kindle.\nAccording to an early review by website iFixIt, the new Kindle 2 features a 532\u00a0MHz 90\u00a0nm processor, 2GB main memory, and 1530 mAh lithium polymer battery.\nKindle 3.\nThe Kindle 3 comes in 2 models. A wi-fi and a 3G. The Wi-Fi can only download books over wireless internet. However the 3G Kindle can download books over Wi-Fi and 3g."}
