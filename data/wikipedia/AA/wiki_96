The movie was released on February 7, 2014.\nBased on the Lego line of construction toys, the movie tells the story of an ordinary Lego minifigure who mistaken for the \"special\", is recruited to join a quest to prevent a tyrannical criminal mastermind Lord Business, from destroying the LEGO universe with the Kragle.\nIt was released theatrically on February 7, 2014. The movie was a critical and commercial success, with many critics highlighting its visual style, humor, voice acting, and heartwarming message. It earned more than $257 million in North America and $210 million in other territories for a worldwide total of over $467 million.\nA sequel, titled \"The Lego Movie 2\" is scheduled to be released on May 26, 2017, with Chris McKay set to direct. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller will return as producers.\nStory.\nIn the Lego universe, the wizard Vitruvius attempts to protect a superweapon called the \"Kragle\" from the evil criminal mastermind Lord Business. He fails to do so, but prophesies that a person called \"the Special\" will find the Piece of Resistance capable of stopping the Kragle.\nEight and a half years later, an ordinary construction worker named Emmet Brickowski from Bricksburg, a city run as a corporate state under the Octan Corporation, comes across a woman named Wyldstyle who searches for something after hours at Emmet's construction site. When he investigates, Emmet falls into a hole and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, Emmet experiences vivid visions and passes out. He awakens with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back in the custody of Bad Cop, Business' lieutenant. There, Emmet learns of Business' plans to freeze the world with the Kragle, revealed to be a tube of Krazy Glue with the label partially rubbed out.\nWyldstyle rescues Emmet and takes him to meet Vitruvius in The Old West, explaining that they are Master Builders, people capable of building anything they need without instruction manuals. She further explains that most of them are incarcerated due to Business' disapproval of such anarchic creativity. Though disappointed to find Emmet displays no creativity, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a gargantuan humanoid deity called \"the Man Upstairs\". Meanwhile, Business, dissatisfied that Emmet had escaped, has Bad Cop come to his office and makes him freeze his own parents in order to make sure that he remains committed to his plan. Upset at Bad Cop's refusal to do so, Business erases Bad Cop's \"Good Cop\" face, which served as his conscience.\nEmmet, Wyldstyle, and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with the aid of Wyldstyle's boyfriend, the superhero Batman, and go to Cloud Cuckoo Land, home of Princess Unikitty. They attend to a council of the remaining Master Builders, who are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack and capture all the Master Builders except for Emmet, Wyldstyle, Vitruvius, Batman, Princess Unikitty, and a \"1980-something space guy\" named Benny.\nAfter being rescued by a pirate named Metal Beard, Emmet devises a team plan to infiltrate Business' headquarters to rescue the Master Builders and disarm the Kragle. During a quiet moment, Wyldstyle and Emmet bond, and Wyldstyle reveals that her real name is Lucy. However, Emmet and his allies are all captured and imprisoned, and Vitruvius is killed with a coin thrown by Lord Business. With his dying words, Vitruvius reveals to Emmet that he had made up the prophecy. Business throws the Piece of Resistance off the edge of the universe, programs the prison to electrocute all the Master Builders, and leaves them (and Bad Cop) to die. As the execution timer counts down, Vitruvius' ghost appears and tells Emmet that it was not the prophecy, but his self-belief that made him the Special. Tied to the execution mechanism's battery, Emmet flings himself off the edge of the universe to save his friends, who escape further danger with the aid of a newly-reformed Bad Cop. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Lucy rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight Business' forces, with the Master Builders leading the charge.\nEmmet finds himself alive and in the real world, where the events of the story are being played out within the imagination of a boy named Finn on his father's Lego set. His arrogant and selfish father \u2014 now revealed as \"the Man Upstairs\" \u2014 is jealous at his son ruining the set by creating hodgepodges of different playsets, and attempts to permanently glue his \"perfect\" creations together back to their normal forms. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet moves off the table and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set where Emmet, now possessing the powers of a Master Builder due to his belief in himself, confronts Lord Business.\nMeanwhile, Finn's father becomes shocked by his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Lord Business on \"him\" and his meaningless greedy perfectionism, due to him \"believing\" that LEGO constructions are only for adults. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that \"he\" is special and has the power to change everything. Finn's father hugs Finn, which plays out as Lord Business has a change of heart and caps the Kragle with the Piece of Resistance, unglues his victims with mineral spirits and thanks Emmet. Lucy becomes Emmet's girlfriend with Batman's blessing. Suddenly, Duplo aliens beam down and announce their plans to destroy the universe, as a result of Finn's father inviting Finn's younger sister to join them in playing with his Lego sets as an apology for his selfishness.\nCritical response.\nThe Lego Movie received many positive reviews. It currently has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nHome media.\nThe Lego Movie was released in DVD and Blue-ray along with Blue-ray 3D on June 17, 2014.\nMarketing.\nThe toy brand and inspiration of the movie, Legos, began making and selling sets based on the movie.\nSequel.\nOn February 3, 2014, Jared Stern was hired to write a sequel, along with another individual. The sequel, titled \"\", was released on February 8, 2019."}

The main city of the valley is Silchar. The region is named after the Barak river. The Barak valley mainly consists of three administrative districts of Assam State - namely Cachar, Karimganj, and Hailakandi. Among these three states, Cachar and Hailakandi belonged to the erstwhile Cachar district in British-India, whereas Karimganj belonged to the Sylhet district . Karimganj was separated from Sylhet after the 1947 referendem; with the rest of Sylhet falling under East Pakistan and Karimganj under India.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Barak\" has derived from the Dimasa words 'Bra' &amp; 'Kro'. Bra means bifurcation and Kro upper portion/stream. The river Barak is bifurcated near Haritikar in the Karimganj district in to Surma River and Kushiyara River. The upstream of this bifurcated river was called Brakro by the local Dimasa people. Over the years, Brakro got converted in to Barak.\nDemography.\nBarak valley had a population of 4,377,612 as per as 2021 census. Hinduism have gone-down from 50% in 2011 to 47% in 2021 due to low fertility rate and large scale immigration of the community from the Valley to others parts of the region in search of jobs and livelihood. The number of Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh into Barak Valley has varied estimates from year 1971-2014. According to the Assam government, (1.3-1.5) lakhs such people residing in the Barak Valley are eligible for citizenship if the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 becomes a law. Islam is the fastest growing religion in Barak valley, As per as 2011 census, Muslims were 48.1% in the valley and in 2021 census it have gone up to 51% due to high fertility rate and lower immigration of the community to others regions/parts of the country.\nChristian missionaries have active in Barak region since from the time of independence. As a result of Christian missionaries, Christianity is rapidly growing among the tribals and poor section of Muslim and Hindu society of the valley since from the past 2 decades. In 2011, Barak valley had 57.9 thousand christians but in the year of 2021, it have grown to almost 74.4 thousands approximately due to high rate of conversion from various church denomination missionaries from the valley.

It is owned by ArenaNet. \"Guild Wars 2\" takes place in a fantasy world that is called Tyria. The game's story is about a guild called Destiny's Edge, and their attempt to kill six evil elder dragons. It is the sequel to \"Guild Wars\". In August 2015, the game became free to play, and had sold more than 5 million copies by then.\nPlaying Guild Wars 2.\nThe world of \"Guild Wars 2\" is the same as the world in \"Guild Wars\", but many changes has been made to it. These changes include new buildings and new landscapes, because \"Guild Wars 2\" takes place 250 years after \"Guild Wars\". Much of the land has also been corrupted by the elder dragons. \nThere are five different races to choose from when you create a new character. These races are Human and Charr, from \"Guild Wars Prophecies\", Norn and Asura from \"Guild Wars Eye of the North\", and the Sylvari, a new race to the \"Guild Wars\" series. There are also 8 professions to choose from. The profession and race of the player decides what special abilities the player can use. As in \"Guild Wars\", the player has a skill bar where he/she can choose from a large pool of abilities. The skill bar is different from \"Guild Wars\". It can now hold ten skills instead of eight, but is more limited. The weapon the player is holding decides the first five skill slots. The 6th slot is used for a healing skill. The 7th, 8th and 9th slots are used to hold the remaining skills that the player can use. Finally, the 10th slot is used for an elite skill, which is more powerful than the other skills. ArenaNet has made the skill bar more limited to solve the balance problem many MMORPGs has. Skills in \"Guild Wars 2\" has also been made in quality instead of quantity.\nThe maximum level is higher than in \"Guild Wars\". The player can now get to level 80 instead of 20. ArenaNet said that level 80 is a good maximum level because it allows the player to go through the game's storyline without having to grind. It was very important for ArenaNet that players in \"Guild Wars 2\" should not have to grind. This is because ArenaNet wanted the players to have fun the entire time they were playing \"Guild Wars 2\". The player's level can also change depending on where in the world the player is. When the players fight monsters the player's level will be the same level as the monsters of that area plus one. For example, if a level 80 character goes to a level 5 area, he will become level 6, if he goes to a level 10 area, he will become level 11.\nThere are two ways the player can fight other players in \"Guild Wars 2\": World versus World and Structured PvP. In Structured PVP the player gains the maximum level and gain access to all abilities in the game. The players then fight players five versus five on matches that are about 10 minutes long. Unlike World versus World the players can not use rewards from Structured PvP anywhere outside Structured PvP. In World versus World the player also gains the maximum level, but can not use abilities that are not unlocked by the players character. World versus world matches are also one entire week long, so the player can join and leave whenever he wants. The goal in World versus World is to take control of capture points; castles, forts and camps. Holding these points gives points to the server holding them. The points gives players rewards in the servers world, such as more experience and more money from killing monsters.\nBecause Guild Wars 2 takes place 250 years after \"Guild Wars\", the player can not keep their character from \"Guild Wars\" in \"Guild Wars 2\". Instead the player can link their \"Guild Wars\" account to the \"Guild Wars 2\" account to get rewards in \"Guild Wars 2\". The points are gained by completing a variety of tasks in \"Guild Wars\". When a task is completed, the player can turn the task into points by adding them to the Hall of Monuments. The Hall of Monuments is available in the \"Eye of the North\" expansion.\nStory.\nGuild Wars 2 takes place 250 years after the player defeats the Great Destroyer in \"Guild Wars Eye of the North\". Over the past 2 centuries, Elder Dragons who has slept under the earth has awoken. Currently, 5 dragons have awoken, and they have started to destroy and corrupt Tyria. The humans have lost almost all of Ascalon to the Charr. The remaining humans now live in Kryta and Ebonhawke. The norn, a race of nordic hunters, has been driven from their homeland in the north by Jormag, an Elder Dragon of ice. The Norn now live in the Southern shiverpeaks, instead of the northen shiverpeaks. The asura, a small but smart race, has been driven out of their homeland to the west. Their underground home has been invaded by destroyers. The Destroyers are servants to Primordus, an Elder Dragon of fire. The asura now live in Rata Sum, a very large city floating in the air. East of Rata sum, a new race has arrived to Tyria; the sylvari, The sylvari are similar to humans, but they are made out of trees, bushes and even mushrooms. They birth from the Pale Tree, a tree that was planted during \"Guild Wars Eye of the North\"."}

When these retinal migraines happen they can also cause a headache, either a \"diffuse\" headache which is a headache that causes pain which is spread out and hurts a person's whole head, or, a \"unilateral\" headache, which is a headache that causes pain on one side of a persons head either, the left side or the right side.\nIt is believed retinal migraines are caused by \"vasospasms \"of the blood vessels of the eye in the area of the \"retina\". The retina is at the back of the inside of the eye. In medicine a \"spasm\" is a sudden constriction or tightening of muscles that is \"involuntary\" - a person does not control them they move on their own. Muscle spasms can happen in different muscles of the body, like when a person's leg or eye \"twitches\". The twitching is caused by the spasms.\n\"Vaso-\" means something to do with the blood vessels, so a \"vasospasm\" causes the muscle cells inside the walls of a blood vessel to suddenly constrict or tighten up. This causes the whole blood vessel to \"constrict\" which means makes the blood vessel narrower. When a blood vessel constricts it is called \"vasoconstriction\".\nWhen vasoconstriction happens less blood the normal is able to flow through the blood vessel, like the way squeezing (constricting) a garden hose makes less water come out. Vasoconstriction can happen for different reasons including because of a medical problem.\nThe second part of a vasospasm -\"vasodilation\" - occurs after the vasoconstriction. After the blood vessel constricts it \"dilates\" - becomes bigger. It may return to normal size or slightly larger than normal size.\nThe vasoconstriction and vasodilation complete one spasm. Spasms often happen many times over and over again. It is beleved that the muscle cells tigntening and loosenening may trigger the pain of a retinal migraine."}

The basic materials may be any meat and/or vegetables. It is ideal for tough meat like mutton and beef cuts which have marbling (fat) and connective tissue. Also, the tougher vegetables should be used.\nIt is traditional to start off with a simple sauce, such as a roux. Even simpler, flour and an Oxo stock cube can be stirred in some milk and water. It is usual for the tougher meats to start off by themselves, with vegetables added later.\nCasseroles and stews are similar. Casseroles often have a topping; stews do not. Stewing is a cooking process whereby heat is applied to the bottom of the cooking vessel (typically over a fire or on a stove), whereas casserole cooking is generally baked in an oven where heat circulates all around the cooking vessel.\nHistory.\nStews have been made since ancient times. It figures in the Roman cookbook by Apicius. Herodotus says that the Scythians (8th to 4th centuries BC) \"put the flesh into an animal's paunch, mix water with it, and boil it like that over the bone fire. The bones burn very well, and the paunch easily contains all the meat once it has been stripped off. In this way an ox, or any other sacrificial beast, is ingeniously made to boil itself.\"\nAmazonian tribes used the shells of turtles as vessels, boiling the entrails of the turtle and various other ingredients in them. Other cultures used the shells of large mollusks (clams etc.) to boil foods in. There is archaeological evidence of these practices going back 8,000 years or more.\nThere are recipes for lamb stews and fish stews in the Roman cookery book \"Apicius\", believed to date from the 4th century AD. \"Le Viandier\", one of the oldest cookbooks in French, written by the French chef known as Taillevent, has ragouts or stews of various types in it.\nHungarian goulash dates back to the 9th century Magyar shepherds of the area, before the existence of Hungary. Paprika was added in the 18th century.\nThe first written reference to 'Irish stew' is in Byron's \"The Devil's Drive\" (1814): \"The Devil\u00a0... dined on\u00a0... a rebel or so in an Irish stew.\""}

Several of her works were shown at an exhibition in Adelaide in 2006, and one of these was bought for the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. Later examples of her batik works were bought by the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Yilpi is also known for making woven items, such as baskets, out of \"tjanpi\" (desert grass). She made several objects with a women's project called the Tjanpi Desert Weavers.\nYilpi began painting much more recently. She has painted both abstract and figurative works.

She is also a community leader on the A\u1e49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia.\nLife.\nMilyika was born in 1958, in Ernabella, northwest South Australia. At that time, it was a Presbyterian mission for Aboriginal people. After finishing primary school here, she went to high school in Alice Springs, at Saint Philips College and Yirara College. She moved back to Ernabella after finishing school. She briefly worked at the community's craft centre, making hand-painted bookmarks and gift cards. She also learned to use batik methods, which had been introduced to the community in 1971.\nAfter about one or two years of working at the craft centre, Carroll decided to become a health worker. She did her training in Adelaide, and then went back to Ernabella to work in the clinic. She still worked at the craft centre sometimes, learning under her mother.\nCarroll is married to Pepai Carroll, and they have five children.\nCommunity work.\nCarroll has been involved in the administration of Ernabella Arts for several years. She served as its chairperson from 2001 to 2003, as its manager from 2004 to 2007, and then as chairperson again from 2007 to 2010. She was also the chairperson of A\u1e49anguku Arts and Culture Aboriginal Corporation from 2004 to 2006, and then became its director. A\u1e49anguku Arts is the organisation that coordinates and supports development of the art economy on the A\u1e49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands. Her husband Pepai has also served as the organisation's chairman.\nIn April 2008, Carroll was chosen to attend the Australia 2020 Summit in Canberra, where she and Makinti Minutjukur represented the APY communities. She has since been involved in school administration in Ernabella, including serving as the chairwoman of the Governing Council of Ernabella A\u1e49angu School since 2011.\nArtwork.\nCarroll is known for painting, printmaking, batik, ceramic and textile works. She uses several printmaking methods, including lithographs, etchings and screen printing. Her painted designs are called \"\", which are designs and symbols that mean something to her. They represent her identity and her own view of the world, and are associated with her family's Dreaming legends. The designs are abstract, and come from ancient ceremonial designs (historically painted on the body or rock).\nCarroll has had her works held in many public and private galleries both in Australia and other countries. Example of her batik works are held in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide, and the British Museum. The National Museum of Australia and the National Gallery of Australia both contain multiple examples of Carroll's printings, etchings, batik works, and textile paintings.\nOne of her earliest works, a painting done on paper, was chosen as one of the finalists for the first National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 1984. In 2011, Carroll's uncle, Dickie Minyintiri, became one of the oldest people to win the award."}

This device is a screen lit by the two vertical sides and filled with a vast number of movable pins. The pins can be pushed back and forth, casting their shadows on the screen to create images. It makes unique visual effects, but because of the meticulousness the technique requires and its time-consuming side, it has been and always remains very rarely used.\nOrigins.\nThe pinscreen is a device invented in the early thirties by Alexandre Alexe\u00efeff, a French engraver, illustrator and filmmaker of Russian origin. Alexe\u00efeff conceived this device to make animation movies showing the same kind of textural effects that its engravings.\nPinscreen device description.\nThe device is a white screen with a multitude of little holes on all its surface. Each hole is filled with a pin that can slide back and forth and the screen is lit by the two vertical sides, allowing the pins to cast their shadow on the screen. If all the pins are pushed in the screen, they can't cast any shadow and the screen appears entirely white. Conversely, if all the pins are pushed out of the screen, it's total darkness. Depending of how far the pins jut out of the front of the screen, their shadows are shorter or longer, allowing the artist to create images in different tones of gray.\nAnimation technique.\nEach of the frames created on the pinscreen is photographed before creating the next frame. When strung together, the frames create the illusion of movement.\nPinscreen movies and legacy.\nAlexe\u00efeff and his partner Claire Parker completed, in 1933, the animated movie \"Night on Bald Mountain\", before making another movie in 1943, \"En passant\", for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Many years later, The NFB acquired a full-sized pinscreen and in 1972, Alexe\u00efeff and Parker were invited back to the NFB and gave several workshops on pinscreen animation to a group of filmmakers. One of the most interested Quebecer filmmaker in pinscreen animation is probably Jacques Drouin. He made several animated movies using that technique : \"Trois exercices sur l'\u00e9cran d'\u00e9pingles d'Alexe\u00efef\" in 1974, \"Mindscape\" in 1976, \"Nightangel\" in 1986 that was co-directed with Bretislav Pojar, \"Ex-child\" in 1994, \"A Hunting Lesson\" in 2001 and \"Imprints\" in 2004. It's with his movie \"Mindscape\" that Drouin expressed his own style with the pinscreen technique for the first time, a style different from Alexe\u00efeff's. On the technical plane, Drouin also innovated with \"Nightangel\", in which he colours the pinscreen images by filtering the light sources. Recently, animator and illustrator Mich\u00e8le Lemieux has made \"Le grand ailleurs et le petit ici\" with the NFB's pinscreen. "}

They are a tribe of the Gondi people. The Muria live in the Bastar district of Chhattisgarh. They traditionally live by agriculture, hunting and fishing, working as a community. They are surrounded by Hindu culture, but they are animists. They have an omnivorous diet, and liquor plays a big role in their society. According to sociologists, the Muria tribe is a very harmonious society.\nWhen they reach adolescence, children leave their family houses to live in a \"ghotul\". A \"ghotul\" is like a mixed-sex dormitory where adolescents practice sexual intercourse, sometimes with a single partner and sometimes with multiple partners. Pregnancy should be avoided and they are obligated to regularly change partners, in order to avoid affection. In the \"ghotul\", the minors govern themselves and it is important to maintain social and traditional order in the group. If the rules are not respected, the children will be punished. They can be expelled from the \"ghotul\" and this can be almost as bad as death.\nIn the \"ghotul\", there is no bond of affection because they want to avoid too much love before the marriage. The objective of all this organisation is to avoid divorce. For the Muria, it is considered important to govern sexuality in their community, because they believe that the sexuality is the biggest problem of humans and that society will not be able to achieve equilibrium if they don't figure prominently in sexuality."}

She works with a range of media, including paint, glass and ceramics. Her most famous design is probably \"Yananyi Dreaming\", which covers a Qantas Boeing 737.\nLife.\nRene was born in 1958, in Ernabella, South Australia. Her family are Pitjantjatjara people, and her Pitjantjatjara name is Wanuny. She grew up in northern South Australia, and then moved to Docker River after she got married. When Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park was handed back to traditional owners in 1985, the couple moved to Mu\u1e6fitjulu to work in tourism. Rene became involved in arts and crafts at the women's centre shortly after. She was a founding director of Walkatjara Art.\nDuring the mid-1990s, Kulitja worked with other women artists on the interior design of the park's cultural centre. She also took a course on glasswork techniques at the University of South Australia, along with three other women. After a successful exhibition of work made using these new skills, Kulitja and the other women got a commission from the Ayers Rock Resort at Yulara for a panel of glass decorated with traditional designs.\nIn 2000, Kulitja was one of over 300 Aboriginal women from Central Australia to perform at the Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games in Sydney.\nIn 2002, Kulitja worked with Balarinji Studio in Sydney to design the outside surface of Qantas Boeing 737. The design she painted was of Ulu\u1e5fu. It was based on traditional designs and sacred Dreaming legends. The fleet was launched on 14 February 2002, with a special ceremony performed by singers and dancers from Mu\u1e6fitjulu. The word \"(y)\" means \"to go\" or \"to travel\" in Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara. It was the third Qantas aircraft to be painted in an Aboriginal design. Kulitja did something similar again in 2010, when a semi-trailer truck was decorated with another of her designs as part of a national roadshow by Ma\u1e5fuku Arts.\nKulitja has held an important position within her community for several years. She has been a member of both the Mu\u1e6fitjulu Community Council and the Board of Management of Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park. In 2006, she became the chairperson of Ma\u1e5fuku Arts. In October 2007, she was elected for a two-year term as a director on the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara (NPY) Women's Council.\nRene's husband, Richard Kulitja, worked in the tourist industry for many years.

The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. To start with, the mission lifetime was 3.5 years.

{"id": "378837", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378837", "title": "Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives", "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the person in charge of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Australia. The person in charge of the upper house is the President of the Senate.\nThe current speaker is Tony Smith. There have been three female speakers, Joan Child, Anna Burke and Bronwyn Bishop.\nThe office of speaker was created by section 35 of the Constitution of Australia. The role of speaker was copied from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\nElection.\nThe speaker is elected by the House of Representatives in a secret ballot. The Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives holds the election. There must always be a speaker, and if the position becomes vacant, then an election must take place before the parliament can do anything else.\nIn Australia the speaker generally remains an active member of their party. They continue to attend party meetings, and at general elections they stand as party candidates. However, Sir Frederick Holder and Peter Slipper resigned from their parties and sat as independents.\nThe speaker can be opposed at a general election. Three speakers, Groom in 1929, Nairn in 1943 and Aston in 1972 have been defeated at general elections. Because the speaker is always a member of the governing party, they have not continued as speaker following a change of government. The opposition sometimes selects one of its own members for speaker after a general election. This is a symbolic act, and the governing party always supports its own candidates.\nSpeakers do not have to resign from Parliament at the end of their term. Two speakers, Makin and Scholes, have become cabinet ministers after having been speaker.\nMost speakers have been long serving party members. Four speakers have been former government ministers Watt, Groom, Cameron and Sinclair. Martin had been a former parliamentary secretary. Snedden had been both a former minister and Leader of the Opposition. Holder and Watt were former state premiers.\nOrigin.\nThe name \"speaker\" comes from early times in the House of Commons of England. \"Mr Speaker\" was the Member of Parliament chosen to speak for them to the king. The first recorded use of the term \"speaker\" was in 1377.\nIn earlier times when the king was very powerful, he would usually only call the parliament together in order to get it to agree to new taxes. The speaker would report parliament\u2019s decisions to the king. This was dangerous if it was not what the king wanted to hear. It was not uncommon for early speakers to be beheaded, with another being \"murdered\". This has led to the modern symbolic show of refusal by a member on being elected speaker. In early days a member\u2019s struggle to avoid being forced into the chair could have been completely genuine. In Australia the tradition is continued by the act of the new speaker being escorted to the chair.\nRole.\nThe Speaker's main duty is to be the person in charge of the House. The Speaker is helped by two Deputy Speakers and a group of Acting Speakers. The second Deputy Speaker is elected from an opposition party. These often take charge during routine debates. The Speaker's role is to:\nAustralian parliaments can be very noisy and often members behave badly. The Speaker has powers to control their behaviour as part of the Standing Orders. The Speaker can tell a Member to leave the House for one hour. For more serious offences, the Speaker may \"name\" a Member. The Speaker will say \"I name the Honourable Member for X.\" In Parliament Members are always called by the name of their electorate. The House then votes on a motion to remove the Member for 24 hours. The House also had the power to permanently expel a Member. This happened once to Hugh Mahon in 1920. In 1987 a new law was passed and Members can no longer be expelled from the Parliament.\nImpartiality.\nAustralian speakers are supposed to be impartial; they are meant to be fair and not to take sides in arguments. They do not take part in debates and they do not usually vote, unless in a rare case the vote is tied. They do not speak out in public about party politics except as part of their own election campaign.\nAlthough not an active political position, the speakers see it as part of their duty to get the government's legislation passed through the house. They usually agree with the government on points of order brought up by opposition members. If the members are unhappy with the speaker they can try to pass motions of dissent, or even of no confidence. These are nearly always defeated as members vote to support their party. \nThere have been several famous clashes between speakers and the government.\nIn 2011, the Speaker Harry Jenkins survived after the house did not support his decision to name Liberal MP Bob Baldwin. The government moved that Baldwin be suspended, but he was supported by the Coalition, independent MP Rob Oakeshott and WA Nationals MP Tony Crook. The vote on suspending Baldwin for 24 hours failed 71\u201372. Normally the speaker would have resigned, but the House of Representatives immediately approved a motion of confidence in the speaker which was passed. Speaker Jenkins continued in office.\nIndependent and non-government speakers.\nThere have been speakers who were not members of the government. Former LNP member Peter Slipper became an independent when the Labor government offered him the job in 2011. Frederick Holder was elected for the Free Trade Party at the first federal election in 1901. He resigned from the party and was an independent speaker until his death in 1909. After the 1940 election, the United Australia Party's Walter Nairn was speaker during the John Curtin's Labor government that was formed in 1941. Opposition MP Carty Salmon was the speaker for Andrew Fisher's Labor government after the 1910 election. At the 1913 election, Labor's Charles McDonald was asked to remain as speaker by the incoming one-seat-majority Commonwealth Liberal Party. He refused but became speaker again after Labor won the 1914 election. McDonald stayed in the job even when the Nationalist Party took government.\nBenefits.\nA member who is elected speaker is given the title 'The Honourable'. With the approval of the sovereign, this title can be used for life. It is usually only given to those who have served as speaker for three years or more. Harry Jenkins, was the first speaker to ask that \"The Hon.\" not be used for him.\nCopying the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the traditional dress of the speaker is court dress. This can include a black silk gown (similar to a Queen's Counsel gown), a wing collar and a lace jabot or bands (another variation included a white bow tie with a lace jabot), bar jacket, and a full-bottomed wig. The wig used by the speaker was donated by Herbert 'Doc' Evatt when he was elected to the House in 1951. He had worn the wig when he was a High Court justice (1930\u20131940). The wig is currently on loan from the speaker's office to the Museum of Australian Democracy. On formal occasions they may also wear court shoes and hose. The dress of speakers has often changes according to the party in power, but it is the personal choice of the speaker. All Labor party speakers have worn business suits, following the example set by their first speaker, Charles McDonald.\nThe speaker, currently, no longer wears the full traditional dress. Billy Snedden (1976\u20131983) was the last speaker to do so. The Labor practice resumed from 1983 until the election of the Howard Government in 1996. The new speaker Bob Halverson chose to wear the court dress of the speaker upon his election in April 1996, but without the wig. Speaker Ian Sinclair chose to wear normal business clothes during his brief term in 1998. However speakers Andrew and Hawker brought back the wearing of the silk gown. Speaker Jenkins resumed Labor practice from 2007 until the election of Peter Slipper in late 2011. Speaker Slipper wore traditional dress with a white long tie or bow tie. He wore a wing collar with white bow tie and bands on the occasion of his first formal procession into parliament. Speaker Burke returned to the Labor practice of wearing normal business clothes."}

{"id": "379068", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379068", "title": "Koobi Fora", "text": "Koobi Fora is a region around Koobi Fora Ridge, on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana, Kenya. It is in the territory of the nomadic Gabbra people. The term East Turkana can be used for the whole area.\nThe ridge is an outcrop of mainly Pliocene/Pleistocene sediments. It is composed of claystones, siltstones, and sandstones that preserve numerous fossils of land mammals, including early hominin species. The ridge is being eroded into a badlands terrain by a series of ephemeral rivers that drain into the northeast portion of modern Lake Turkana. \nIn 1968 Richard Leakey established the Koobi Fora Base Camp on a large sandspit projecting into the lake near the ridge, which he called the Koobi Fora Spit. A survey and numerous excavations showed the region was a source of hominin fossils from the last 4.2 million years. Far exceeding the number of humanoid fossils are the non-humanoid fossils, which give us a look at the fauna and flora as far back as the Miocene.\nIn 1973, the government of Kenya reserved the region as Sibiloi National Park, establishing a headquarters for the National Museums of Kenya on Koobi Fora Spit. The reserve is well-maintained and is well-guarded by friendly but armed park police. Protection of sites and especially of wildlife are of prime concern.\nExploration and excavation are done by the Koobi Fora Research Project (KFRP), which collaborates with universities and individuals around the world.\nArchaeological sites and artifacts.\nArchaeological sites.\nThe simple hierarchy of scientific places for Koobi Fora is the following: Koobi Fora is the region; the region is divided into fossil collecting areas; within fossil collection areas there are archaeological sites and hominid paleontological localities. \nLocating and referencing the hundreds of sites in the Koobi Fora region has been an ongoing process. The entire reservation was divided into somewhat over 100 numbered areas. In the year 2000 the KFRP went over to a GPS system.\nSome notable areas are as follows.\nThe first archaeological site, i.e., FxJj 1, was found in Area 105. It is nicknamed the KBS site for Kay Behrensmeyer Site, after the researcher who first found stone tools there. This site is also the place where the first tuff was found, i.e., the KBS Tuff.\nIt is known as the location of skull 1470, discovered by Bernard Ngeneo in 1972, reconstructed by Meave Leakey, later reconstructed and named \"Homo habilis\" by Richard Leakey, as possibly the first of the genus \"Homo\", and finally \"Homo rudolfensis\". Richard Leakey found it 45 m below the 1.89 my KBS tuff; thus, it is older than that date, but is conventionally dated to it.\nHominid fossils.\nSearching for and finding fossils in such a large area is another difficult problem. One solution has been to organize all persons present into a group to sweep a designated area. Richard Leakey devised a method that produced better results: he organized and trained a search team of Kenyans, which became known as \"the hominid gang\", under the leadership of Kamoya Kimeu. They have discovered the majority of the fossil Hominins, which currently amount to over 200.\nKoobi Fora is perhaps best known for its specimens of the genus \"Homo\", but those of the genus \"Australopithecus\" also have been found. The following species are represented:\n\"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo\" seem to have coexisted in the region for about one million years. One possible explanation is different food sources. It is believed that \"Australopithecus\" became extinct and \"Homo\" went on to generate later species.\nStone tools.\nLarge quantities of stone tools have been found at Koobi Fora both on the surface and in caches, which have dates of their own, but are seldom in association with hominins. No other candidates for their manufacture have been found, however. The tools are Oldowan and Acheulean. The Koobi Fora community has devised the following teminology to describe three local industries:\nWith the change from Olduwan to Acheulean technique, hominins got more of a return for a given output of energy and could do more. The chief technological development was the edge of the handax. The advantage of the \"core reduction strategy\" was more and thinner flakes per mass of cores. More and better flakes meant better use of carcasses and therefore a need for fewer carcasses, less hunting, etc. Moreover, the increased number of flakes available made ranging farther from the source of the stone possible and gave more staying power to the hunt.\nStratigraphy.\nKoobi Fora is underlain by Pliocene basalts and filled with nearly 600 meters of Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments, dating from about four-million to one-million years ago.\nMost early human fossils and archaeological remains come from the upper portion of the Burgi Member, the KBS Member, and the Okote Member. The members reflect changing environments in the Turkana Basin, from lake and delta ones during Burgi Member times to rivers and floodplains in Okote Member times.\nThe stratigraphy of the Koobi Fora Formation is one of the best studied and calibrated in East Africa. Controversial dating of the KBS Tuff during the 1970s helped to spearhead the development of modern potassium/argon and argon/argon geological dating methods. In addition, the unique fusion between geochronology and mammal evolutionary studies has made the Koobi Fora Formation a standard for all of Pliocene-Pleistocene Africa."}

He was the lead singer of the rock band Alice in Chains. He was born in the city of Kirkland, Washington.\nAlice in Chains.\nLayne Staley first played in a band called Sleze which consisted of Shorewood High School students as well as future members of the bands The Dehumanizers and Second Coming. The band morphed into Alice 'N Chains in 1986 and mostly played cover versions of Slayer and Armored Saint songs. Alice 'N Chains disbanded and Staley joined a funk band afterwards. The band needed a guitarist so Staley asked Jerry Cantrell to be a sideman for the band. Cantrell agreed but only if Staley joined his band. After the funk band disbanded, Staley joined Cantrell's band full-time and they renamed the band Alice in Chains.\nWhile he was with Alice in Chains, They released their debut album \"Facelift\" which featured the hit single, \"Man in the Box\" which was written by Staley. They then released an EP called \"SAP\" on February 4, 1992 and released their second studio album \"Dirt\" on September 29, 1992. \nThe band didn't tour for \"Dirt\" very long because of Staley's drug addiction. Cantrell often wrote the lyrics for the band but Staley wrote more songs as time went on and was eventually credited with writing half of the band's catalog until their fourth studio album, \"Black Gives Way to Blue\". When Staley wrote lyrics, they were often about dealing with his personal problems like drug use and depression.\nThe other band members decided not to tour for their third studio EP \"Jar of Flies\" because of Staley's condition becoming progressively worse. Staley decided that he would enter a rehabilitation clinic after Jar of Flies and started a side project with Mike McCready of Pearl Jam and Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees called The Gacy Bunch. They later changed their name to Mad Season. During his time in Mad Season, they released 1 studio album, \"Above\" which featured the singles \"River of Deceit\" and \"I Don't Know Anything\".\nStaley's physical condition was changing during the hiatus of Alice in Chains and his addiction started to become more known to the public. Alice in Chains reunited to record the self-titled album \"Alice in Chains\", also commonly referred to as \"Tripod\" and it was released on November 7, 1995.\nIn October 1996, Staley's ex-fianc\u00e9e, Demri Lara Parrott, died from complications caused by drug use. Her death made Staley even more depressed. He removed himself from the spotlight until he joined Alice in Chains at the Grammy Awards in 1997 after the song \"Again\" was nominated for \"Best Hard Rock Performance\". He recorded two songs for the Music Bank box set and producer Dave Jerden said that \"Staley weighed 80 pounds\u2026and was white as a ghost.\" \nStaley hardly left his condo from 1999 to 2002. \nDeath.\nOn April 19, 2002, police kicked in Staley's apartment door to find Staley dead on his couch. His autopsy reported that a combination of heroin and cocaine known as a \"speedball\" that he had injected was a factor in his death. Staley was reported to be 6'1\" and weigh only 86 pounds when his body was discovered, mainly because of his body decomposing due to him being discovered two weeks after his death."}

Impurities are removed, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium and vanadium are added to produce the exact steel required. Steel mills then turn molten steel into blooms, ingots, slabs and sheet through casting, hot rolling and cold rolling."}

His theories helped scientists figure out political science. Buchanan won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1968 for his theory.\nEarly life.\nBuchanan was born on October 3, 1919 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. His ancestry includes Scottish and Irish. He was raised in Chicago, Illinois and in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Buchanan studied at University of Chicago, at the University of Tennessee, and at the State Teachers College, Murfreesboro.\nIdeas.\nBuchanan is the founder of a new Virginia school of political economy. Buchanan is largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy in the second half of 20th century.\nThe term \"constitutional economics\" was used by James M. Buchanan as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. Buchanan\u2019s work in 1986 brought him the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his \"development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making.\"\nBuchanan rejects \"any organic conception of the state\" as superior in wisdom, to the citizens of this state.\" This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believes that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens. It must be able to balance interests of the state, society, and each individual.\nIn 2001 Buchanan received an honorary doctoral degree from Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, for his contribution to economics.\nThe \"New York Times\" commented that the Nobel Prize-winning economist who championed public choice theory influenced a \"generation of conservative thinking about deficits, taxes, and the size of government\".\nInfluences.\nHe was influenced by Frank Knight, Knut Wicksell, and by Ludwig von Mises.

Forrester was a founding member of a number of Aboriginal organisations in central Australia. He lives at Mu\u1e6fitjulu, where he has served as the chairman of the community council. During the 1980s, he served as an advisor on indigenous affairs to the governments of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke.\nForrester has been a prominent political activist on issues affecting indigenous Australians for many years. He has been a strong critic of the Intervention in the Northern Territory, and the lack of economic and educational development in communities affected by it.\nEarly life.\nForrester was born in 1952 in Alice Springs. His family is a mixture of Luritja and Arranda, but one of his grandfathers was Scottish. Vincent grew up on a cattle station in the Angas Downs area. He learned from his grandparents about the sacred legends associated with his country, and about bush foods and bush medicine. He went through initiation when he reached maturity.\nAs a young teenager, Forrester worked as a station-hand and stockman. Later, he worked in an abattoir. For three years, he served in the army in Townsville. At various other times he worked as a horse-riding clown and a rodeo rider.\nForrester's first language is Luritja, but he also speaks English and Arrernte.\nActivism and politics.\nForrester has been an activist for Aboriginal Australians for most of his life. While growing up in Angas Downs in the 1960s, Forrester grew angry with what he saw as a lack of human rights for indigenous people. He rebelled against the government's assimilation policies during his school years, and then joined the campaign for indigenous land rights.\nDuring the 1970s, after returning from the army, Forrester helped to set up the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress (CAAC), a health care service for indigenous people. He served as a field officer, and then later as its secretary. He also helped to set up the Central Land Council. In 1982, he represented Australia at the first session of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, held in Geneva. In the middle of the 1980s, he helped to set up the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA). He has served as the organisation's treasurer, manager, and as a board member of its television network, Imparja.\nNational Aboriginal Conference.\nIn November 1977, aged in his mid-20s, Forrester became a founding member of the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC). He was elected chairman for the Northern Territory in October 1981. In this position, he would serve as an advisor to the governments of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke on matters relating to indigenous people.\nIn 1979, a group called the National Aboriginal Government occupied Capital Hill in Canberra and set up the Tent Embassy. Kevin Gilbert and other protesters demanded that the federal government enter into negotiations for a treaty with Aboriginal people. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said he would only discuss the matter with the NAC, since it was the only elected body representing Aboriginals. Shortly after, the NAC began working on a draft proposal for this treaty. The government was opposed to the word \"treaty\", so the NAC chose to use a Yolgnu word, \"Makarrata\".\nAfter his appointment as the NAC chairman for the Northern Territory, Forrester was put on the subcommittee in charge of drafting the \"Makarrata\" proposal. The proposal was for a treaty that recognised the sovereignty of Aboriginal nations in Australia. People wanted the government of Australia to deal with Aboriginal nations as it would deal with another sovereign nation under international law. Through the 1980s, the support for this treaty amongst Aboriginal people grew steadily. After talking with Aboriginal communities in his home region, Forrester was convinced that his people were in favour of a treaty. He argued, however, that the negotiations should be done under the oversight of the United Nations.\nThe NAC was dissolved by the Hawke government in 1985. Despite this, planning on the content and principles of the \"Makarrata\" proposal continued, with Forrester staying very involved. The campaign for the treaty remained strong through the 1980s, reaching its height in 1988. Forrester did an interview with Kevin Gilbert about it on CAAMA radio in 1989.\nEconomic apartheid.\nAs more and more Aboriginal people around Ulu\u1e5fu became involved in tourism, Forrester began working as a tour guide at Kings Canyon. He later became a ranger for Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park, and a mentor at Alice Springs Desert Park, training young Aboriginal people as guides and park rangers. He believed tourism and conservation had excellent opportunities for Aboriginal people. He was firmly against any economic development that comes from uranium mining. A lot of central Australian communities depend on grants to mining companies for income, but Forrester argues that this reliance must be broken.\nWhile working in tourism, Forrester became outspoken about the lack of job opportunities for indigenous people living in the centre of Australia. Because of this, he said, the communities were living in poverty, and that the situation would continue to get worse until the federal government began talking to the communities directly. A lot of the problem, Forrester claimed, was due to racism. He called the situation \"economic apartheid\". He also acknowledged, however, that most people from indigenous-speaking communities lacked the literacy in English needed to keep a job. Most adults could not read and write, and the younger people did not have enough access to education. As a result, Forrester worked for several years in developing school curricula. In May 2011, the Ayers Rock Resort at Yulara was sold to the Indigenous Land Corporation. At the time of the sale, two out of the 700 people working at the resort were indigenous. At the start of 2013, it was reported that the number of indigenous workers had risen to 170; 35% of them were from Mu\u1e6fitjulu.\nDespite being critical of Malcolm Fraser whilst he was in office, Forrester later reflected that Fraser was one of the few Prime Ministers who sat down to talk with indigenous communities about issues affecting them.\nThe Intervention.\nIn 2006, an ABC television program reported that children in Mu\u1e6fitjulu as young as five had contracted sexually transmitted diseases and that girls were being prostituted for petrol. Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough claimed that children at Mu\u1e6fitjulu were being sexually abused. This caused serious anger from Mu\u1e6fitjulu leaders. When Brough visited the community in October, Forrester shouted at the minister and demanded that he say sorry.\nA formal inquiry later found that alcoholism and child sexual abuse were widespread in remote Aboriginal communities of the Territory. In response, in 2007, the government of John Howard introduced a series of measures aimed at addressing the problem. It is often referred to as \"the intervention\". The measures were seen as racially discriminatory by many people, including Forrester. He was already a leader in Mu\u1e6fitjulu at the time. In February 2008, he travelled to the Tent Embassy in Canberra to hear the new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, formally say sorry to the members of the Stolen Generations. While he was there, he talked with other indigenous people from the Territory about the effects of the intervention. The group then met with politicians at Parliament House to discuss their demands. Forrester called the intervention an \"occupation\" of indigenous lands by the military, and demanded that the polices be stopped. He encouraged Aboriginal people in the Territory to disobey the intervention laws in protest.\nForrester argued that the social problems can be avoided if the government provides the right kind of schools and services. Despite statistics showing that the number of sex crimes against children in Mu\u1e6fitjulu was going down, Forrester maintained that the community was still in crisis. He pointed to the fact that the population of Mu\u1e6fitjulu had also decreased by more than 40%; people were leaving. Forrester claimed that the government has been too slow in dealing with the source of the problem (jobs and education), and that life in Mu\u1e6fitjulu has only gotten worse since the intervention laws.\nIn 2009, Forrester was made chairman of the Mu\u1e6fitjulu Community Council. Around this time his brother was accused of corruption and Vincent with the rest of the community council board forced his brother's resignation. He now lives on the outskirts of Alice Springs semi-retired but also a member of the National First Nations Uluru Constitutional Convention Board\nArtwork.\nForrester began painting in the early 1990s. He paints stories from the Dreamtime. He has said that his art represents a story and a \"spiritual legacy\" for his descendants. Originally, he used acrylic paints, but he has since began using natural ground-up paint made at Ulu\u1e5fu. Traditional methods, tools and techniques are used to grind natural pigments into powder form, and then mixed with a binder to become a thick, sticky paint. The colours Forrester uses in his paintings are the traditional colours used for ceremonial body paint.\nHis painting \"Resurrection at Mutitujulu Waterhole\", done using these methods, was chosen as a finalist for the Togart Contemporary Art Award in 2012. It depicts the waterhole at Ulu\u1e5fu, and the story of (rainbow serpent). It was part of a series dedicated to women."}

Expected to be a boomtown when first settled, it was mostly abandoned when mining operations failed. \nDuring the First World War, Broughton was used by the 185th Cape Breton Highlanders as training ground. During this time the famous Broughton Arms Hotel burned to the ground in April 1916. The Hotel is believed to have had North America's first revolving door.\nHistory.\nBroughton was first settled at the turn of the 20th century as a mining town for the Cape Breton Coal, Iron &amp; Railway Company, started by British mining engineer Thomas Lancaster and British businessman Col. Horace Mayhew which intended to develop the coal seam at Cochrane's Lake (aka: Loon Lake). The pair raised millions of dollars, mostly from English investors, and construction on the town was started, with streets laid out and a number of large official buildings constructed, including the Office Building, the Assistant Manager's House, the Broughton Arms Hotel and Crown Hotel. Remains of these substantial buildings can still be seen today, the scale of which giving an impression of the town's lofty ambitions. A railway was built connecting to the Sydney &amp; Louisburg Railway at False Bay Head, continuing through Broughton Junction to Broughton, a distance of 4 \u00bd miles, construction beginning in 1905 and completed in 1906. Seemingly too much money and effort was spent on the details and modern conveniences of the \"most up-to-date modern city\", one of the first attempts at a planned community in Canada, and not enough attention to the actual mine operation. The company went bankrupt in 1907 after it failed to secure rail transportation to get its coal to port. It is said this was due to the opposition of the Dominion Coal Company, which would not allow its Sydney and Louisburg Railway to carry the coal produced by the mine.\nThe British pair left Cape Breton, abandoning the company and the town.\nThe community remained active until its peak in 1916.

They were common in the Upper Carboniferous, and became extinct at the end-Permian extinction. Their size varied from large to huge. For example, \"Mazothairos\" had a wingspan of about .\nHerbivores.\nThey were the first major group of herbivorous insects. They had long, beak-like, piercing mouthparts, and probably a sucking organ. The mouthparts match the signs of damage in fossil plant leaves and stems.\nFlight.\nIn addition to the normal four wings, they had two \"pronota\" in front. These pronota were smaller than the regular wings, but had wing veins just like the real things. They did not move up and down, so maybe they helped gliding. The Palaeodictyoptera are sometimes whimsically called \"six-winged insects\". The actual wings are often boldly marked: the patterns of colour can be seen in fossils.\nThese insects had paired \"cerci\" (singular: cercus) on their rear segment. The function of these is not clear. Cerci often serve as sensory organs, but they may also be used as weapons or copulation aids, or they may simply be vestigial structures. The cerci on some species was longer than the rest of the insect."}

He worked for most of his life as a labourer and conservationist. He is the manager and senior traditional owner of Walalkara, a homeland and Indigenous Protected Area on the A\u1e49angu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. He began work as an artist in 2004, aged in his 70s. His artworks are now held in several major galleries in Australia.\nLife.\nRobin was born at Walalkara, a place in the Great Victoria Desert near Kaltjiti, South Australia. His father was Pitjantjatjara from the land west of Watarru; his mother was Yankunytjatjara from Makiri, northwest of Walalkara. Robin grew up living a traditional, nomadic life in the area around Kaltjiti. The first time he saw a whitefella was when he was a young teenager. As a young man, he worked on the cattle stations at Welbourne Hill and Everard Park.\nWhen he was much older, Robin moved back to Walalkara and set up an outstation for his family on his homelands. He lives there with his wife, Tyayangka, and his children. Kankapankatja is the senior traditional owner (\"\") of Walalkara. The people that live on this outstation are all part of his family. They are the land managers of Walalkara Indigenous Protected Area, a federally protected reserve created from an agreement between the Robin family and the Australian government. It covers of the Great Victoria Desert. Until 2008, Kankapankatja and his wife Tyayangka worked as rangers of the reserve. When they retired, their children took over its management.\nArtwork.\nRobin began working as an artist in July 2004, while he was at home recovering from surgery. His paintings and drawings are about Walalkara. They depict the landscape, animals, and spiritual Dreaming stories associated with it. He is also known for carving traditional tools, such as boomerangs, spears, spear-throwers and shields.\nSince 2006, Robin's work has been shown in many exhibitions alongside other Kaltjiti artists. In 2007, he was featured at the Mossenson Galleries in Collingwood, Victoria. His work was featured as part of the annual \"Desert Mob\" exhibition in Alice Springs, in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. It was also exhibited in Adelaide at the Flinders University City Gallery in 2009, and the South Australian Museum in 2010.\nIn 2012, the Cross Cultural Art Exchange in Darwin held a solo exhibition of Robin's work. The exhibition was called \": this is my life from long ago\". It showcased a series of drawings that depict Robin's memories from growing up in the bush, and the legendary journeys of his ancestors. In the same year, his work was also shown at the annual \"Our Mob\" exhibition in Adelaide, at an exhibition of Kaltjiti Arts in the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair, and in Germany, in an exhibition at the ArtKelch gallery in Freiburg im Breisgau.\nExamples of Robin's work are held in the collections of the Araluen Arts Centre, Flinders University, and the National Gallery of Australia. Others are held in the national Artbank collection, and several private collections, such as the Gallery Gabrielle Pizzi in Melbourne."}

It appears as a tall and thin man, wearing a black suit and tie. The man's face is usually blank, without any features. It is said to stalk, abduct, or scare people, especially children.\nThe Slender Man was originally created on the Internet forum Something Awful in 2009. It has grown into a kind of urban legend.\nDescription.\nThe Slender Man is described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long arms. It can extend its arms to scare people or capture them. It has a white, featureless head and appears to be wearing a dark suit. In images, the figure is often out of focus and blurry. The Slender Man is associated with the forest and has the ability to teleport.\nOrigins.\nThe Slender Man was created during a contest on the Something Awful forums in June 2009. The goal was to change photographs using digital manipulation so that the pictures showed something supernatural. On 10 June, a forum poster with the user name \"Victor Surge\" uploaded two images in black and white. They were photographs of groups of children, to which had been added an obscured figure in the background: a tall, thin man with a blank face. Surge included short stories to go with the images, describing the disappearance of the children in the images. It gave the character the name, \"The Slender Man\":\nOne of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze. Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as \u201cThe Slender Man\u201d. Deformities cited as film defects by officials. Fire at library occurred one week later. Actual photograph confiscated as evidence.&lt;br&gt;\n1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986.\nThese stories made it a work of fiction. Other users on the forum developed the character further, adding their own images or stories about \"The Slender Man\". However, is it possible to find supposed records of the monster dating back to the 14th century, a notable example is a medieval German folktale entitled \"Der Ritter\" (\"The Knight\" in German), it tells the history of a brave knight appointed by the church to slay a great evil entity who had been stealing children from a local village from around the Black Forest, W\u00fcrttemberg, in Southern Germany, by which some people claim the existence of the entity. \nDevelopment.\nThe Slender Man soon became very popular on the Internet. Many works of fanart, cosplay and fiction were created and spread from website to website. The first video series involving the Slender Man was published on YouTube. It is called \"Marble Hornets\", and is now one of the most popular Slender Man creations. Other YouTube serials about the Slender Man followed, including EverymanHYBRID and Tribe Twelve. In 2011, Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of the sandbox indie game \"Minecraft\", added a new character to the game. He named it the \"Enderman\" when many users on Reddit and Google+ commented on how similar it was to the Slender Man. A video game based on the Slender Man was released in 2012, named \"Slender: The Eight Pages\". Several popular variants of the game followed, including \"Slenderman's Shadow\" and \"Slender Man\" for iOS, which became the second most-popular app download. The sequel to \"Slender: The Eight Pages\", \"Slender: The Arrival\", was released in 2013.\nA horror movie about the Slender Man, \"Entity\", was released in 2013. Another, \"The Slender Man\", was released free online. On August 10, 2018, another movie about the character, \"Slender Man\", directed by Sylvain White, was released. \"Marble Hornets\" is also being made into a movie.\nThe Slender Man was called \"the first great myth of the web\" by the BBC. The success of the idea has been ascribed to the Internet's ability to connect people with one another. It has allowed anybody to build on the story and develop the character, and also shape it into whatever frightens them most."}

It is a graphical environment (a program that runs on top of an operating system), instead of an operating system by itself. It became the first successful version of Windows in the market. Windows 3.0 was the first version to be widely seen as a rival to Apple's Macintosh and Commodore's Amiga on the graphical user interface (GUI) front. It was followed by Windows 3.1.\nWindows 3.0 was created in 1989, when David Weise and Murray Sargent independently decided to develop a protected mode Windows as an experiment. They compiled a prototype and showed it to Microsoft executives, who approved it as an official project.\nUpdates.\nWindows 3.0a.\nOn December 31, 1990, Microsoft released Windows 3.0a. This version contained an improved ability to move pieces of data greater than 64KB (the original release could only manipulate one segment of RAM at a time). It also improved stability by reducing Unrecoverable Application Errors (UAEs) associated with networking, printing, and low-memory conditions. This version appears as \"Windows 3.00a\" in Help/About Windows system dialogs.\nWindows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions.\nBased on Windows 3.0a, and originally called 3.0b, Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0 was released in October 31, 1991 to support sound cards, as well as CD-ROM drives, which were then becoming more available. This edition was released to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), mainly CD-ROM drive and sound card manufacturers, and some PCs came preloaded with it. This edition added basic multimedia support for audio input and output, along with new applications: Media Player, CD audio player, more advanced Help format, screen savers, and a new clock. These new features were integrated into Windows 3.1x. Microsoft developed the Windows Sound System sound card specification to support these extensions. The new features were not accessible in Windows 3.0 Real Mode.\nThe MME API was the first universal and standardized Windows audio API. Wave sound events played in Windows (up to Windows XP) and MIDI I/O use MME. The devices listed in the \"Multimedia/Sounds and Audio\" control panel applet represent the MME API of the sound card driver.\nMME does not have channel mixing, so only one audio stream can be rendered at a time. MME supports sharing the audio device for playback between multiple applications starting with Windows 2000, up to two channels of recording, 16-bit audio bit depth and sampling rates of up to 44.1\u00a0kHz with all the audio being mixed and sampled to 44.1\u00a0kHz."}

His father, Dr. Robert Bland, was an obstetrician. Bland joined the Royal Navy in 1810 as a surgeon and served on HM sloop \"Hesper\". While in Bombay, India he got into an argument with another officer, Robert Case. He challenged Case to a duel with pistols on 7 April 1813, and Case was killed. Bland was found guilty of murder and sentenced to seven years prison in Van Diemen's Land.\nConvict.\nBland arrived in Hobart on the ship 'Denmark Hill' in January 1814. He was sent to Sydney on the 'Frederick' on 14 July 1814. He was kept in the Castle Hill gaol for a short time where he was able to work as a doctor. He was pardoned on 27 January 1815. He set up business as a doctor. He married Sarah Henry in 1817, but they separated after a few months.\nIn 1818 he wrote critical comments about Governor Macquarie's treatment of farmers. He also made fun of Macquarie's desire to have his name on foundation stones. Bland's handwriting was recognised. On 25 September 1818 he was found guilty of libel, fined \u00a350 and sent to prison for a year.\nCommunity life.\nIn 1830 he opposed attempts to sell large areas of crown land. He joined the Australian Landowners Association in 1831 to fight new land laws. When the Sydney Free Grammar School closed after only one year in 1826, Bland came up with a scheme to start a new school to replace it. Sydney College began in 1830. The foundation stone of a new building was laid by the Chief Justice, Sir Francis Forbes, in 1830. Bland was treasurer of the of the college from 1835 to 1844. In 1845 he became president. The buildings were sold to the University of Sydney in 1853. Sydney Free Grammar School and Sydney College were the beginnings of the current Sydney Grammar School which began in 1854.\nHe worked at the Benevolent Society as well as having a private medical practice. He dispensed medicines from his house until a proper dispensary was begun. He gave the Society advice on building a room to be an operating theatre and mortuary. He continued to assist at the Society until 1863.\nHe gave land and money to build a church at Ashfield.\nHe was an active writer. he wrote articles on new medical techniques which were published in the Lancet magazine. He wrote articles for the Australian Medical Journal on snake bite and dislocations. He edited the book \"Journey of Discovery to Port Phillip, New South Wales\" written by William Hovell and Hamilton Hume. He wrote a small book about how to prevent fires on ships carrying wool. He designed the \"Atmotic Ship\", a balloon filled with hydrogen and moved by propellors. A model of the atmotic ship was shown at the International Exhibition in London in 1851 and at Crystal Palace in 1854.\nPolitics.\nIn 1835 the Australian Patriotic Association (APA) was formed. William Wentworth was president, and Bland was the secretary. His letters for the APA show Australia beginning to see itself as an independent nation. The main function of the APA was to draw up a constitution for New South Wales. The constitution was accepted by the British parliament and self government began in 1843.\nHe was an elected member to the new New South Wales Legislative Council twice (1843\u20131848, 1849\u20131850) and was appointed to the Council from 1858\u20131861\nIn 1849 Wentworth introduced a bill to create the University of Sydney. He named Bland as one of its first senators. Robert Lowe reminded members that Bland had been a convict and had killed a man in 1813. He said that such an important institution should not be run by convicts. The bill failed. Bland wanted to fight a duel but Lowe avoided it. The bill was re-introduced without Bland\u2019s name and was passed.\nA banquet was held in July 1856 to celebrate the grant of a new Constitution by the British government. Bland was the guest of honour. On 5 November 1858 he was given money and a candelabrum for his services to the community. He resigned on 21 March 1861 from the Legislative Council.\nLate life.\nIn February 1846, Bland remarried a widow, Eliza Smeathman. He continued to work as a doctor until 1868. He was the founder and first president of the Australian Medical Association in 1859. A photograph was taken of him in 1845. This is the oldest surviving Australian photograph. In 1861 he was declared a bankrupt. He died in Sydney on 21 July 1868 of pneumonia, and was given a State Funeral."}

She moved to New York in 1969. There she met Andr\u00e9's father, Gilles Roy. They got married a few weeks later. They left New York to go to Mamaroneck, near Port Chester, New York. They had three children: Marc, Kevin and Andr\u00e9. When Andr\u00e9 was only two months old, the family moved to Sainte-Julienne, Quebec. This village is in the region of Lanaudi\u00e8re.\nHockey.\nAndr\u00e9 started to play hockey at the age of five. He started playing hockey in Novice A category but he was much better than the other players of his team. During his third season, he became an Atom CC player. Roy did not weigh as much as the other players, but he was one of the tallest. Martin Saint-Louis, another professional hockey player, said that when Andr\u00e9 was young, he was one of the best players in Lanaudi\u00e8re.\nDuring the winter, Roy stayed at the ice rink as much as possible. During the summer, he played hockey with rollerblades in the streets or in his driveway. According to his mother, he shot so many hockey pucks that he destroyed the cedar hedge and broke every window of his garage at least two times. In 1987, Andr\u00e9 entered in the Peewee BB category. His slapshots were so powerful that the other teams' goalkeepers were scared. The next year, Roy played in the Peewee AA category. During his third season in the Peewee category, Roy wanted to be in the AA team but problems he had with the AA's coach made it so that he could not. He met Steve Latreille, the BB's coach, during his third Peewee season. During his second season in the Bantam category, Andr\u00e9 tried to play in the AA team with the North's S\u00e9lects. Again, he could not because of issues with his ex-coach. He played in the CC category because there was no BB team that year in Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me. It was at this time that Andr\u00e9 started to forget his dream of playing in the NHL. He decided to quit hockey.\nThree days later, Steeve Latreille called him because he wanted a player as good as Roy in his team. Andr\u00e9 accepted and became the CC team's captain. According to Latreille, Roy is the best player coached by him, and also a very selfless person who did not want to steal the show because of his talent. He did a very good job as a captain and supported his whole team. Roy's powerful shot also became faster as he played more. Roy was accepted in the AA Midget team of Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me but he became a player in the Select's CC Midget team because his father had already organized a hockey trip to Finland.

She had a short career as an artist, beginning only in 2002. During this time, however, her work was taken in by several major public galleries.\nLife.\nPompey was born on a sand dune near Finke, in the southern Northern Territory. This inspired her name; \"\" is the word for a sandhill in languages of the Western Desert. Pompey's parents were Yankunytjatjara people from lands further south, around Kalka and Ka\u1e49pi in South Australia. Pompey grew up in the area around Finke, and then moved south to Ernabella when she was a young woman. At the time, this was a Christian mission set up for Aboriginal people coming in from the desert. While living in Ernabella, learned art and craft at the community's craft room. She learned how to sew, make batik, dye fabrics and spin sheep's wool to make rugs.\nPompey's husband, who she married at Ernabella, was a Pitjantjatjara elder and law keeper for the country around Kaltjiti. They moved to Kaltjiti after it was set up as an outpost in the 1960s. They had 8 children, including six boys and two girls.\nPompey started painting for the community's art centre, Kaltjiti Arts, in 2002. She painted regularly and became quickly noticed by critics. In 2003, one of Pompey's paintings, titled \"Pita\", was chosen as a finalist for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Another of her works, \"Para - Desert Gums\", was chosen as a finalist for the competition in 2010.\nIn the ten years that she worked as an artist, Pompey's works became well represented in Australian collections. In 2007, she suffered a mild stroke, which affected the movement in her left hand. She recovered and then continued to paint up until her death. She died on 16 November 2011, in Alice Springs.\nArtwork.\nPompey's paintings depict features of the central Australian landscape, such as sand hills, flowers and trees. These are painted with a soft-focus, hazy look. Most of her paintings are minimalist in style, combining basic shapes of colour with dotted fields or lines. She was known for thick brushstrokes and a wide use of colour.\nPompey's designs were also used in a series of rugs made by Kaltjiti Arts, which combined traditional Kashmiri techniques with Australian Western Desert designs.\nPompey's work has been exhibited widely in Australia, mostly in group exhibitions. The Mossenson Galleries in Melbourne held two solo exhibitions of Pompey's work. The first was in 2005. The second was in 2012, after her death, and showed a selection of her final works.\nExamples of her paintings are now held in the National Gallery of Victoria, and the Art Gallery of South Australia."}

They had a mixture of Old World monkey and ape characteristics, and their position in the evolution of the apes is still not clear. Leakey also discovered the robust \"Zinjanthropus\" skull at Olduvai Gorge.\nFor much of her career she worked together with her husband, Louis Leakey, in Olduvai Gorge, uncovering the tools and fossils of ancient hominins. She developed a system for classifying the stone tools found at Olduvai. She also discovered the Laetoli footprints. In 1960 she became director of excavation at Olduvai. Eventually, she chose and trained her own staff. After the death of her husband she became a leading palaeoanthropologist, helping to establish the Leakey tradition by training her son, Richard, in the field.\nExcavations.\nLeakey served her apprenticeship in archaeology under Dorothy Liddell at Hembury in Devon, 19301934, for whom she also did illustrations. In 1934 she was part of a dig at Swanscombe where she discovered the largest elephant molar known at the time in Britain. She needed help to identify its species.p47\nOlduvai.\nThe years 1935 to 1959, spent at Olduvai Gorge in the Serengeti plains of Northern Tanzania, yielded many stone tools from primitive stone-chopping instruments to multi-purpose hand axes. These finds came from Stone Age cultures dated as far back as 100,000 to two million years ago.\nThe Leakeys unearthed a \"Proconsul africanus\" skull on Rusinga Island, in October 1948.\nIn 1960, unable to leave the museum except on weekends, Louis appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai. She brought in a staff of Kamba tribesmen, instead of Kikuyu, who, she felt, took advantage of Louis. The first, Muteva Musomba, had kept her children's ponies. He recruited Kamoya Kimeu among others. Mary set up Camp 5 under Jonathan's direction. He was 19. From then on she had her own staff and associates.\nMary picked and sieved at the site from early morning dressed in old clothes, chain smoking cigarettes, always surrounded by her Dalmatian. She and Louis communicated by radio. On weekends he drove non-stop at high speed the 357 miles between Olduvai and Nairobi. The teen-age boys, Richard and Philip, were on site holidays and vacations.\nAfter Louis.\nAfter Mary's husband died, she continued her work at Olduvai and Laetoli. It was here, at the Laetoli site, that she discovered Hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million-years-old. She also discovered fifteen new species of other animals and one new genus.\nFrom 1976 to 1981 Leakey and her staff worked to uncover the Laetoli hominid footprint trail which was left in volcanic ashes some 3.6 million years ago. The years that followed this discovery were filled with research at Olduvai and Laetoli, the follow-up work to discoveries and preparing publications."}

{"id": "379423", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379423", "title": "Laetoli", "text": "Laetoli is a site in Tanzania, dated to the PlioPleistocene. It is famous for its hominin footprints, preserved in volcanic ash. The site of the Laetoli footprints is 45\u00a0km south of Olduvai gorge. It was excavated by archaeologists Louis and Mary Leakey in 1978. \u201cThe Laetoli Footprints\u201d got a lot of attention from the public because they are convincing evidence of bipedalism in Pliocene hominins.\nDated to 3.6 million years ag,o they were the oldest known evidence of hominin bipedalism. Now older evidence has been found, such as the \"Ardipithecus ramidus\" fossils. The footprints and skeletal structure excavated at Laetoli were clear evidence that bipedalism evolved before enlarged brains in hominids. Although it is debated, it is believed the three individuals who made these footprints belonged to the species \"Australopithecus afarensis\". Together with footprints were other hominin and animal skeletal remains and Acheulean artifacts (hand-axes).\nAfter debate, it was decided that \"Australopithecus afarensis\" is the species of the three hominins who made the footprints at Laetoli. This is based on the reconstruction of the foot skeleton of a female \"A. afrarensis\" hominin. Detailed footprint analysis compared both human and bipedal animals such as bears and primates. Gaits (stride pattern), and foot structure were analysed. Step length, stride length, stride width and foot angle showed that \"A. afarensis\" was more human-like in gait than ape-like.\n\"A. afarensis\", then, is an obligate bipedal hominid. Its brain size was very similar to that of modern chimpanzees and gorillas. So, in one important respect it was like the genus \"Homo\" since it was bipedal. That means it was adapted to living in open woodland and savannah, not tropical rain forest. On the other hand, it had a brain about the size of an ape. This situation, where different traits of an animal evolve at different rates, is known as mosaic evolution.\nFootprints in Europe.\nThe oldest hominin footprints in Europe are in Britain. They are about 800,000 years to a million years old. They were found on Happisburgh beach, East Anglia.\nThe archaeologists describe them as \"the oldest known hominin footprint surface outside Africa at between ca. 1 million and 0.78 million years ago\". The site in known for its preservation of sediments with early Pleistocene fauna and flora. Since 2005 flint tools have been found. This means humans occupied northern Europe at least 350,000 years earlier than was thought before."}

He was Premier of Quebec from 2003 until 2012 under the Quebec Liberal Party.\nEarly life.\nCharest was born and grew up in Sherbrooke. Before politics, he worked as a lawyer. He received his diploma from the University of Sherbrooke in 1981, and was admitted to the Bar of Quebec the same year. After 3 years of working in court, Charest decided to join the Conservative Party of Canada in 1984. He was only 26 years old when he was elected as the representative of Sherbrooke.\nConservative Party of Canada.\nJean Charest had joined the Conservative Party of Canada in 1984. In the same year, he was appointed as Assistant Deputy Chair of Committees of the House of Commons. On June 1986, he joined the Cabinet of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He was the youngest person to serve in the Cabinet. He was given the job of Minister of State for Youth. Charest was re-elected in 1988, and served as Minister of State for Fitness and Amateur Sport.\nIn 1984, the Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney, promised that Quebec would sign the Canadian Constitution, which every other province had already signed two years before. Jean Charest was very involved in this project, but it did not succeed.\nReferendum of 1995.\nIn 1995, Quebec was governed by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, who started a referendum about whether Quebec should stay as a part of Canada. In others words, the population had the choice of staying or leaving the country. Jean Charest was against the idea of Quebec leaving the union. The results were very close, but Quebec stayed as part of the country.\nLiberal Party of Quebec.\nDuring the 1990s, the sovereignty movement was at its height. Jean Charest, who was a big part of the \"No\" campaign in 1995, had won the support of many federalists from Quebec. This is why he joined the Liberal Party of Quebec in 1998, as the leader of the party. In 1998, Charest participated at his first election as a leader of a party. He received more votes than his opponent, but did not reach the majority. He stayed as official Leader of the Opposition until 29 April 2003.\nCharest won the next election and became Premier of Quebec on the 29 April 2003 by receiving 45.99% of the votes from the electors. Mario Dumont from the \"Action D\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec\" and Bernard Landry from the \"Parti Quebecois\" were his opponents. The Liberal Party won 76 out of 125 seats.\nPremiership.\nDuring his government, there were crises with the housing industry and university funding. Charest was not able to lower taxes as he had promised during his campaign. In the 2008 election, the Liberal Party under Jean Charest got re-elected as the government, with 66 out of 125 seats and 42% of the votes from Quebec's electors. Charest himself was less popular in this election than the other one before. He gained 33.08% of the votes from the electors.\nThe popularity of Jean Charest dropped down very quickly. On 4 September 2012, Charest had been defeated and he decided to quit.\nAfter his resignation, Jean Charest decided to give more time to his family and begin working again as lawyer. At least five law firms have shown interest in his services, especially one in Toronto.\nFamily.\nAt the age of 18 years old, Jean Charest met Mich\u00e8le Dionne who became his wife. They met while they were studying in Sherbrooke. Mich\u00e8le Dionne had been considerate as a big part of his career, she has supported and has influenced many of his choices while he was in politics. Am\u00e9lie, Antoine and Alexandra are their 3 children."}

It is caused by inflammation of pouches (diverticula) in the walls of the bowel. It usually occurs in the large intestine. Diverticula can also be in the upper digestive tract at the level of the esophagus, stomach and small intestine.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of diverticulitis depend on the extent of inflammation in the intestine. Diverticulitis can be very painful. The pain is usually present in the lower abdomen on the left side. People with diverticulitis can also have nausea, vomiting, difficulty or pain while passing urine and changes in bowel habits.\nComplications.\nOne of the complications of diverticulitis can be the formation of an abscess in the abdominal cavity. The inflammation or infection can then reach the abdominal wall and causes peritonitis. This infection can also spread to other parts of the body such as organs near the intestine, causing sepsis, which is dangerous. In addition, a fistula may form between the intestine and other organs. Diverticulitis may also cause a blockage in the colon.\nPrevention.\nTo prevent diverticulitis, it is important to be active and to have a diet rich in fibers. These include eating (fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals). It is also possible to reduce the risks of diverticulitis in several ways: chew foods before swallowing, defecate as soon as you feel the need, eat less fats and meats, do more physical activities, eat probiotics and drink water regularly.\nDiagnosis.\nTo diagnose diverticulitis, it is important to do a barium enema X-ray to see the shape of the intestine wall. Diverticula can be seen with a axial tomographie scan (CT scan). It is also possible to prescribe an abdominal radiograph to indicate if there is a perforation. After the acute phase or absence of acute diverticulitis, the doctor can prescribe a colonoscopy to look at the colon and determine the evolution of the disease.\nSurgery.\nThe resection of the colon is the procedure most often used to treat severe diverticulitis. It is also possible to do a resection of the diseased part of the colon and make a colostomy. In fact, if a diverticulitis is too large, a colostomy could be necessary either temporarily or permanently."}

Hunters were now obligated to jump fences and this became a very popular activity. In 1912, show jumping made its first appearance in the Olympic Games. \nShow jumping is one of the very few sports where men and women are equal in competitions. This sport requires a muscular horse with a good cardiovascular endurance. Also, it must have a quick and stable temperament for the best performance. The breeds that are the most sought for this sport are Selle Fran\u00e7ais, Anglo-Arabe, Oldenburg, Warmblood (including Holsteiner and Hanoverian), Thoroughbred and Trakehner.\nRules.\nTo win the first place, the rider and his horse must complete the course as quickly as possible without making any mistakes. A fault or mistake occurs when the horse knocks down a fence or obstacle or if it disobeys; such as refusing to jump or makes a run-out. In fact, if a fault occurs the rider receives a penalty and loses automatically four points per mistake. Also, a rider can lose some points if he exceeds the given time; a penalty is deduced at each exceeding second. Also, a rider can be eliminated because of a fall down or does not do the course correctly. The course is established in advance by the course designer. A designated judge decides whether the rider is eliminated or not and if he is, the judge decides when.\nThe riders who complete a course without any mistake can go to the next step, which is the jump-off. It is a shorter race: again the goal is to complete the course as quickly as possible and without making any mistake. The rider who has the best time wins the competition. If mistakes are made, seconds are added to the final time and this is why only the time score determines the winners."}

The product of Islamic philosophy is an Islamic society. Philosophy, as a \"project of independent philosophical inquiry\", began in Baghdad in the middle of the eighth century.\nEarly Islamic philosophy refers to the time period of the 8th to the 12th century. This time is often called the Islamic Golden Age. There are two main branches of philosophy, Kalam, and Falsafa. Falsafa is a word that comes from Greek; it refers to the kind of philosophy much like it was done in Ancient Greece. Kalam literally means \"speech\": it uses dialectic in philosophy. One of the first \"discussions\" was about free will, a school called \"Qadar\" said there was free will, another school called the Jabarites said there was not."}

The instrument is made of a leather or synthetic bag. The three drones are single-reed instruments and make harmonies. The chanter is a double-reed instrument used to play the melody. The instrument also has a blowpipe used to inflate the bag.\nBag and blowpipe.\nThe bag is filled with air by the player to inflate it and flow air into the drones and the chanter. The bag used to be made of leather (sheepskin or cow) but is now commonly made of synthetic material (Gore-Tex) for the ease of maintenance. The blowpipe is a simple pipe used to inflate the bag with the player\u2019s breath. \nDrones.\nThe great highland bagpipe has three drones used for harmonies. The big one is called a \u201cbass drone\u201d and the two little one are called the tenors. These three drones are tuned on the same note and give the background sound that harmonizes with the chanter. The length of the drones can be adjusted to tune them. If the length is shorten, the pitch will be sharper, if it\u2019s lengthen, the pitch will be lower. \nChanter.\nThe chanter is a conical bored instrument with height holes in it. This instrument has been made of wood since the instrument's origin but is now made of plastic in some cases. The player opens or closes some of these holes with his fingers to give the melody. \nPlaying.\nTo play the instrument, the player (called a bagpiper or a piper) will inflate the bag and will place it under his left arm when the bag is fully inflated. The piper will now keep the pressure in the instrument with his arm. When he has to stop breathing in the bag, he\u2019ll use his elbow to press the bag and keep the pressure on. This way of playing gives the opportunity to the player to play music during a long period of time without stopping for the need of breathing. Once the instrument is inflated, the piper have to tune one of the drones to match the chanter and, after that, he'll tune drones to match them together. If the piper do this operation carefully, he will be able to have a perfectly balance instrument. Once it's done, the player can start playing his instrument."}

She was planning to become a nurse until a high-school teacher suggested that she try acting. McQueen studied with Janet Collins and went on to dance with the Venezuela Jones Negro Youth Group. Around this time she received the nickname \"Butterfly\" because of her constantly moving hands in the Butterfly Ballet in a production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".

For example, Cato the Younger is known for using filibuster tactics to block Julius Caesar's rise to power. \nUnited States.\nIn the United States, a filibuster allows a senator to block a bill he or she does not like by speaking on behalf the bill for too long on purpose so it would not be brought to a vote.\nBefore a bill can voted on, current rules in the Senate must allow all Senators to debate for as long as they want and they can \"filibuster\" legislation by refusing to end debate. To break a filibuster requires 60 out of 100 votes known as a \"cloture\". If the cloture is successful, debate ends and the vote can begin. If it fails, debate can continue in which most bills die as it was blocked from being voted on. This means the Senate must have at least 60 votes to end the filibuster to move on to vote on a bill that needs only 51 votes to pass. \nOnly reconciliation bills are immune from filibusters and can be passed by a simple majority. In 2013, the filibuster rules were changed to prohibit filibusters for voting on the president's nominees for agencies and courts with the exception to appointing judges to the Supreme Court of the United States which still require 60 out of 100 votes by the rules. \nAnother way the filibuster can be stopped without requiring 60 votes is if the Senate Majority Leader uses the \"nuclear option\" which is very rare. It allows the Senate Majority Leader to change the rules of a bill that can filibustered by lowering the minimum votes required from 60 to 51 votes, which also stops the filibuster. This was last used in 2017 when Mitch McConnell, who was the Senate Majority Leader at the time, used the nuclear option to stop the Democrats from blocking the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by Donald Trump. \nMany critics of the filibuster argue it unfairly gives the Senate Minority too much power because they'll be able to block any bill the Senate Majority wants to pass. In 2021, the Democratic Party introduced legislation that would eliminate the filibuster that could be passed with only a majority vote. Democratic senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona said they will not vote to change any existing rules on the filibuster therefore Democrats will not have at least 50 votes to modify the filibuster as all 50 Republican senators including Manchin and Sinema confirmed they will vote no to any removal or changes to the filibuster.

It has shiny yellow eyes, yellow feet, and small tuffs of fur with its ears. Its feathers are a reddish brown speckled with white. Like all of the members of its family, it has fake eye spots that are black and outlined in white on the back of its neck. The Northern Pygmy Owl's stomach is white with black stripes. The Northern Pygmy Owl tends to perch in a diagonal position rather than an upright position.\nBreeding.\nNorthern pygmy owls nest and breed in evergreen-filled forests and woodlands with variety. They normally mate in Spring. They prefer to live in tree cavities or old woodpeckers' holes. They do not add anything to their nest. The mothers keep three or four eggs warm. But she waits for all of the eggs to be laid before she starts incubating. That is an inimitable trait of northern American owls. While the female owl takes care of the eggs, the male consistently brings food for them. After the eggs hatch, the mother takes care of them for about one week. The baby owls will gain the ability to fly in about twenty-seven to twenty-eight days.\nHabitat.\nNorthern pygmy owls are widespread across North America. They usually live in the scattered areas with less trees, rather than large parts of land with lots of unbroken trees. Northern pygmy owls are most active during the dawn or the dusk. Northern pygmy owls can also be seen in the daytime, when the weather is overcast. They like to perch on conifer or small trees, or in a snag. When they perch, they bob their head up and down, and flick their tails, and hold their tails to one side.\nDiet.\nOne third of the pygmy owls' diet are rodents, large insects, and small birds. Northern pygmy owls are very aggressive hunters, so fast that they can catch their prey in flight."}

It was natural that in the hot places of Egypt and Mesopotamia refreshing water gardens should be found. As early as 1225 BC, Ramses III built water lily ponds. \nThe Inca of Peru built gold and silver water channels, pools, and basins as early as 2500 BC. Their homes and palaces had water running in channels under the floors to cool the surrounding air. Their courtyards had cooling pools for tired travelers.\nThe Chinese and Japanese imitated nature in their water gardens. The water garden was a sign of perfection and peace. By the third century AD they had written down the essentials of a water garden. In the 15th century, they turned the water garden into an art form that used the sound and motion of water. A reflecting pool expressed the union of heaven and earth. The Japanese built a dry garden, using small rocks, sand, and other materials to represent the course of a stream or river.

It is the twelfth of their fourteen operettas. It was first performed at the Savoy Theatre in London on 7 December 1889. It ran for 554 performances. It tells of two gondoliers. One appears to be the heir to the throne of Barataria, but which one? \nOrigin.\nAfter completing \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", Sullivan wanted to leave light opera for more serious music. Gilbert reminded him that light, humorous operas were the source of their great success. Their manager Richard D'Oyly Carte promised Sullivan the opportunity to write a grand opera on the condition that he continue to write the light operas. Sullivan accepted. The grand opera would be \"Ivanhoe\".\nComposition.\nGilbert proposed a Venetian setting for the new light opera. Sullivan would have the chance to write bright, colorful music. Sullivan went to Venice to soak up the atmosphere. Once back in England, he received the lyrics to the new opera as Gilbert completed them. Sullivan however puttered at them. He was distracted with plans for the grand opera. He devoted the fall of 1889 however to \"The Gondoliers\". Sullivan labored at the light opera and completed it by December 2. The curtain went up on \"The Gondoliers\" on December 7 before a brilliant audience. The press raved.\nSuccess.\n\"The Gondoliers\" was an instant hit in London, chalking up 554 performances. It earned more money than any other Savoy opera in its original run. 20,000 copies of the published score were sold on publication, and over 70,000 copies of various arrangements were sold within a few days. \nD'Oyly Carte's \"E\" Company mounted the first provincial production on 19 February 1890 in Preston, Lancashire. From then on, it was never absent from the touring repertory until it was omitted from the final two seasons (September 1980\u2013February 1982) before the closing of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.\nStory of the opera.\nMarco and Giuseppe are two gondoliers. One of them is believed to be the King of Barataria. But which one? It is decided that the two will jointly rule Barataria until the King's identity is brought to light. To complicate the story, a Princess has been promised in marriage to the King of Barataria. In the end, the two gondoliers marry their long time Venetian sweethearts. The Princess discovers her father's drummer boy is the long lost heir to the throne of Barataria. She is thrilled because she has always loved him. Everyone lives happily ever after."}

The main campus is in the suburbs of Camperdown and Darlington. Founded in 1850, it is the oldest university in Australia and Oceania. In 2011, it had 32,393 undergraduate and 16,627 graduate students.\nThe University of Sydney is organised into sixteen faculties and schools. They offer bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and doctoral degrees. The univsersity often ranks amongst the best universities in Australia and Oceania. In 2012, it was ranked 39th in the world; 3rd in Australia, behind Australian National University (24th) and the University of Melbourne (36th) in the 2012 QS World University Rankings.\nLocation.\nThe main campus is in the top 10 of the world's most beautiful universities. This is according to the British Daily Telegraph and the American Huffington Post. This ranking is among other campuses, such as Oxford's and Cambridge's. \nThe campus spreads across the inner-city suburbs of Camperdown and Darlington. First, it was in what is now Sydney Grammar School. Then, in 1855 the government granted land in Grose Farm to the university. This is three kilometres from the city. Now, this land has the main Camperdown campus on it. \nThe main campus is the home base of the large Sydney Medical School. This school has many affiliated teaching hospitals across the state. \nThe main campus is the focus of the university's student life. The student-run University of Sydney Union has three buildings. These are the Wentworth, Manning and Holme Buildings. These buildings house a large proportion of the university's catering outlets. These buildings also provide space for recreational rooms, bars and function centres. One of the most significant activities organised by the Union is Welcome Week. This is a three-day festival at the start of the academic year. Welcome Week centres on stalls set up by clubs and societies on the Front Lawns. \nThe main campus is also home to a variety of statues, artworks, and monuments. These include the Gilgamesh Statue and the Confucius Statue. \nThe NSW state government has reduced transport links to the campus. It also reduced transport links to the closest Redfern railway station. But, there is still access to buses on the neighbouring Parramatta Road and City Road. This is to prioritise the growth of other Sydney universities. \nHistory.\nIn 1854, the architect Edmund Blacket designed the first buildings. Then, in 1858, people finished building the Great Hall. In 1859, people finished building the Main Building. Finally, in 1862, people completed the Quadrangle and Great Tower buildings. \nIn the mid-20th century, the university expanded in enrollment. This led the university to buy more land.\nThe 2002 conservation plan of the university stated many campus features are significant. This includes Victoria Park.\nSince 2007, the university has used space in the former Eveleigh railway yards. They are to the south of Darlington. It has used this space for examination purposes. \nIn 2015, The NSW Department of Planning and Environment endorsed a plan. This was the University of Sydney's $1.4 billion Campus Improvement Plan. It involved many new important structures and renovations. \nIn 2018, the government agreed to put sites on the state heritage register. These include the University of Sydney and some surrounding areas. This created a conservation area. This area contains the Camperdown campus and the nearby Victoria Park.\nThe beginning of 2021 saw the closure of the Cumberland campus. Then, some health disciplines returned to the Camperdown campus. They did this in the state-of-the-art, purpose-built Susan Wakil Health Building."}

It was initially intended to provide a free alternative to Unix (GNU stands for \"GNU's Not Unix\"). The Hurd was the intended implementation of the GNU operating system before Linux became the kernel of choice for GNU users. The current goal of the Hurd project is:\n[T]o create a general-purpose kernel suitable for the GNU operating system, which is viable for everyday use, and gives users and programs as much control over their computing environment as possible.\nThe Hurd kernel consists of a microkernel that provides basic kernel services and a collection (or \"herd\") of servers / daemons that provided services that are beyond basic. This design was meant to provide developers with freedom that Unix and other Unix-like operating systems did not. For example, this design allows developers to program servers in languages other than the one used by the kernel. GNU Mach currently is the microkernel being used in the Hurd.\nRichard Stallman created the GNU project in 1983 and founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985 in order to fund and promote the development of free software and GNU. By the early 1990's, the GNU toolchain and other components besides the kernel were completed. Work began the Hurd in 1990. Stallman decided to use Carnegie Mellon University's Mach microkernel as the basis for the Hurd microkernel.\nIn 1991, Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, and free software enthusiasts ported GNU's completed components to the Linux kernel in order to create GNU/Linux. NetBSD and FreeBSD were released a couple of years later, yet the Hurd was not in a functional state. Due to the presence of functioning alternatives, interest in the Hurd waned. As the FSF moved away from GNU development and more towards free software activism, Debian became more involved in the Hurd's development."}

The house and park were owned by the Lucy family from the 13th century to 1945, when they were presented to the National Trust.\nSir Thomas Lucy tore down an earlier structure to make way for the present house in 1558. He was a man of wealth. He entertained Queen Elizabeth I at breakfast in 1572 as she made her way to Kenilworth. Lucy is better known for having fined the young William Shakespeare over a poaching incident in 1583. This incident prompted Shakespeare to flee Warwickshire for London.\nCharlecote was inherited in the direct male line until George Lucy died in 1786. This man improved the house. He hired Capability Brown to improve the park about 1769. In the early years of the 19th century, another George Lucy continued improvements, leaving little unchanged except for the gatehouse."}

Usually, a double or a triple bond are made by this reaction.\nThere are two main ways to do an elimination reaction. The first is called E1. It happens in two steps. If there is a good leaving group in the molecule, it can leave on its own. Then, a base or another substance can take away the other group. The second way is called E2. This happens only in one step. In this case, the base takes away one group while at the same time the leaving group goes away.\nA common elimination reaction happens with alcohols. If there is strong acid around, a molecule of water can be eliminated to form the double bond."}

Usually, only the overall change can be seen in a reaction. The things made in between react too quickly to be seen. These are called intermediates, and in going from one intermediate to another a transition state is crossed. However, it is important to understand all the steps that make the total change. This is because then one can understand more difficult reactions or try to make a reaction work in a certain way.\nThere are many type of reaction mechanisms. In organic chemistry, the more common ones are nucleophilic substitution, elimination and addition. People sometimes use arrow pushing to draw how electrons move around during a reaction. This makes it easy to see which bonds are formed and which are broken during the process."}

It depicts the Greek sun god Apollo rising from the sea at daybreak in his four-horse chariot. He is accompanied by Tritons. In 1639, Louis XIII had a pond dug on the site of the fountain called the Pond of the Swans. In 1671, Louis XIV enlarged the pond. Le Brun suggested it be dedicated to Apollo based on its east-west orientation. The parallels drawn between Louis and the sun god also entered into the decision. Le Brun's Apollo is seen sitting in his four-horse chariot. He rises from the grotto of Thetys where he has spent the night. This theme was popular in the arts at the time. The gilded statue was made by Tuby of Rome. It was installed in 1671. Beyond the fountain lies the Grand Canal. The Fountain of Apollo incorrectly depicts Apollo rising in the west rather than the east.\nIn 2014, a same-scale replica was unveiled in Tainan, Taiwan, at the entrance of the Chimei Museum. The museum commissioned French artist Gills Perrault in 2008 to reproduce the Fountain of Apollo, same as the one in Palace of Versailles. It took three years for modern laser measuring and the mold to be made in France for the reproduction sculpture, and another three years to carve the marble in Italy. This Fountain of Apollo in Chimei Museum, however, correctly depicts Apollo rising from the east. "}

It was set with 12 large diamonds, 30 rubies, sapphires, and emeralds for the coronation of George I in 1714. \nDuring the coronation ceremony, the Archbishop of Canterbury places the orb in the right hand of the Monarch. It is put back on the altar. The Monarch leaves the coronation wearing the Crown, carrying the Scepter, and holding the Orb.\nWilliam and Mary came to the throne in 1689 as King and Queen, each in their own right. An orb was made for Mary II. It is called Queen Mary's Orb. It was used once and never used again. Both orbs were placed on Queen Victoria's coffin at her funeral.\nThe orbs are hollow balls of gold. The Sovereign's Orb is 6.5\" in diameter. It weighs 42oz 7dwt. Queen Mary's orb is smaller: it measures 5.75\" in diameter. It weighs 34oz 6dwt. Queen Mary's orb was originally set with hired jewels. Today it is set with imitations for display purposes. The Sovereign's Orb is currently set with over 600 precious stones and pearls."}

They sat for their portraits in April and June 1777. Reynolds was paid three hundred pounds for the work in 1780, and touched up and re-varnished the picture in 1789.\nReynolds believed in the what was called the \"Grand Manner\". The two years involved in completing the portrait would have aged the children. \"But Reynolds worked from abstract principles of design rather than observation of nature,\" the National Gallery of Art writes, \"One of his conceptions for Grand Manner likenesses was: \"Each person should have the expression which men of his rank generally exhibit.\" Reynolds therefore suppressed psychological individuality to gain a grandeur appropriate for these aristocrats.\"\nReynolds alluded to the Madonnas of Raphael (such as the \"Madonna of the Goldfinch\") in the triangular configuration of the sitters. This was another attempt to evoke the Grand Manner. Rembrandt and Titian are hinted at in the browns of the background. \nCynthia Saltzman writes in \"Old Masters, New Worlds\" (2009) that \"Lady Delm\u00e9 has a long, elegant face, heavy-lidded eyes, and towering powdered hair. She wears a white dress and a cloak that covers her knees in a cascade of rose-colored satin that speaks both to her beauty and to the luxury at her command.\" Saltzman writes that \"Lady Delm\u00e9\" is one of the finest representatives of Reynolds's intent to raise portraiture to the level of history painting. English portraiture of the period \"flattered the sitter\", Saltzman explains, by depicting the sitter as a member of a powerful ruling class whose very existence made the world a better place."}

It stars Johnny Depp as 1950s teen rebel \"Cry-Baby\" Wade Walker, and also features a large ensemble cast that includes Amy Locane, Iggy Pop, Traci Lords, Ricki Lake, Kim McGuire, David Nelson, Susan Tyrrell, and Patty Hearst. The film did not achieve high audience numbers in its initial release, but has subsequently become a cult classic and spawned a Broadway musical of the same name which was nominated for four Tony Awards.\nThe movie is a parody of teen musicals (particularly \"Grease\") and centers on a group of delinquents that refer to themselves as \"drapes\" and their interaction with the rest of the town and its other subculture, the \"squares\", in 1954 Baltimore, Maryland. \"Cry-Baby\" Walker, a drape, and Allison, a square, create upheaval and turmoil in their little town of Baltimore by breaking the subculture taboos and falling in love. The film shows what the young couple have to overcome to be together and how their actions affect the rest of the town.\nPart of the movie takes place at the now-closed Enchanted Forest amusement park in Ellicott City, Maryland. Others take place in the historic towns of Reisterstown, Jessup, Milford Mill and Sykesville, Maryland.\nPlot.\nIn 1954 Baltimore, Wade \"Cry-Baby\" Walker is the leader of a gang of \"Drapes\", which includes his teenage mom sister Pepper, facially disfigured Mona \"Hatchet Face\" Malnorowski, wild and free-spirited Wanda Woodward, and Milton Hackett, the nervous son of overzealous religious activists. His ability to shed a single tear drives all the girls wild. One day after school, he is approached by Allison Vernon-Williams, a pretty girl tired of being a \"square\", and the two fall in love. That same day, Cry-Baby approaches the \"square\" part of town to a talent show (\"\"Sh-Boom\", \"A Teenage Prayer\") at the recreation center where Allison's grandmother hosts events, and introduces himself to her, who is skeptical of his motives. Cry-Baby invites Allison to a party at Turkey Point, a local hangout spot for the drapes.\nDespite her grandmother's skepticism, Allison accompanies Cry-Baby to Turkey Point and sings with the drapes (\"King Cry-Baby\"\"). As Cry-Baby and Allison tell each other about their orphan lives (Cry-Baby's father was sent to the electric chair after being the \"Alphabet Bomber\" - a killer who bombed places in alphabetical order airport, barber shop etc.; Allison's parents always took separate flights to avoid orphaning her if they crashed, but one day both their planes went down), Allison's jealous square boyfriend, Baldwin, starts a riot. Cry-Baby is blamed for the fight and sent to a penitentiary, outraging all his friends and even Allison's grandmother, who is impressed by Cry-Baby's posture, manners, and musical talent.\nAs Lenora Frigid, a girl with a crush on Cry-Baby but constantly rejected by him, claims to be pregnant with his child, Allison feels betrayed and returns to Baldwin and the squares, though her grandmother advises her against rushing into a decision. Meanwhile, in the penitentiary, Cry-Baby gets a teardrop tattoo. He tells the tattoo artist, fellow drape Dupree (Robert Tyree): \"I've been hurt all my life, but real tears wash away. This one's for Allison, and I want it to last forever!\".\nEventually, Allison is persuaded by the newly established alliance between the Drapes and her grandmother to stand by Cry-Baby and join the campaign for his release (\"Please, Mr. Jailer\"). Cry-Baby is released but immediately insulted by Baldwin who, after revealing that his grandfather is the one who electrocuted Cry-Baby's father, challenges him to a chicken race. Cry-Baby wins, as Baldwin chickens out, and is reunited with Allison.\nThe movie ends with all watching the chicken race crying a single tear, all except for Allison and Cry-Baby, who has finally let go of the past, enabling him to cry from both eyes."}

The dispute is between India, Pakistan and China. India claims all of the region that was once a princely state. It currently controls about 43% of the territory, including most of Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and the Siachen Glacier. India's claims are disputed by Pakistan, which controls about 45% of Jammu and Kashmir, including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Pakistan says there should be a referendum in Kashmir on whether the people want to join India or Pakistan, or become independent.\nHistory.\nThe conflict started during the Partition of India (1947\u201348). On October 20, 1947, tribesmen backed by Pakistan invaded Kashmir. The Maharaja of Jammu &amp; Kashmir initially fought back but on 27 October appealed for assistance to the Governor-General Louis Mountbatten, who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India and that a plebiscite would be held afterwards, which was not. Once the papers of accession to India were signed, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to stop any further occupation, but they were not allowed to expel anyone from the state. India took the matter to the United Nations. The UN resolution asked Pakistan to vacate the areas it has occupied and asked India to assist the U.N. Plebiscite Commission to organize a plebiscite to determine the will of the people. Pakistan refused to vacate the occupied areas.\nIn 1947-8 India and Pakistan fought their first war over Jammu and Kashmir. Under United Nations' supervision, they agreed to a ceasefire along a line which left one-third of the state - comprising what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern Areas administered by Pakistan and two-thirds, Jammu, Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley, controlled by India. In 1972, under the terms of the Simla agreement, the ceasefire line was renamed the Line of Control. \nAlthough India claims that the entire state is part of India, it has been prepared to accept the Line of Control as the international border, with some possible modifications. Both the US and the UK have also favoured turning the Line of Control into an internationally-recognised frontier. \nBut Pakistan has consistently refused to accept the Line of Control as the border since the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley would remain as part of India. Formalising the status quo also does not take account of the aspirations of those Kashmiris who have been fighting since 1989 for independence for the whole or part of the state.\nWater dispute.\nAnother reason behind the dispute over Kashmir is water. Many rivers start in Kashmir. Some of them are tributaries of the Indus River basin, such as the Jhelum and Chenab River. These flow into Pakistan and are used for irrigation there. Other rivers like the Ravi, Beas River and the Sutlej flow into northern India.\nOne of the origins of the conflict is that with the Boundary Award of 1947, many of the Pakistani irrigation systems can be controlled from India. Pakistan has been afraid that India could stop the flow of rivers that start in Indian-controlled Kashmir and flow into Pakistan. This would harm the agrarian economy of Pakistan. The Indus Waters Treaty signed in 1960 resolved most of these disputes over the sharing of water.\nCurrent status.\nToday Kashmir is split, as follows:\nKashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 60 years. Currently a boundary - the Line of Control - divides the region in two, with one part occupied by India and one militarily administrated by Pakistan. India would like to formalise this status quo and make it the accepted international boundary. But Pakistan and Kashmiri activists reject this plan because they both want greater control over the region.\nMap issues.\nAs with other disputed territories, each government issues maps depicting their claims in Kashmir as part of their territory, regardless of actual control. It is illegal in India to exclude all or part of Kashmir in a map. It is also illegal in Pakistan not to include the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Non-participants often use the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control as the depicted boundaries, as is done in the CIA World Factbook, and the region is often marked out in hashmarks, although the Indian government strictly opposes such practices. When Microsoft released a map in Windows 95 and MapPoint 2002, a controversy was raised because it did not show parts of Kashmir as part of India as per Indian claim. However, all the neutral companies claim to follow the UN's map and over 90% of all maps containing the territory of Kashmir show it as disputed territory."}

It is an episode in Act III of Giacomo Meyerbeer's grand opera, \"Robert le Diable\". It premiered in November 1831 at the Paris Op\u00e9ra. The choreography (now lost) was created by either Filippo Taglioni or Jean Coralli. \nThe short ballet tells of deceased nuns rising from their tombs in a ruined cloister to seduce the knight, Robert le Diable. At the end of the ballet, the white-clad nuns return to their tombs. The ballet was created because officials at the Paris Op\u00e9ra wanted to demonstrate the building's newly installed gas lighting. The lighting was capable of creating ghastly effects. \n\"The Ballet of the Nuns\" starred Marie Taglioni as the Abbess Helena. Although opening night was marred with a few mishaps, Taglioni made her indelible mark on the ballet world in the role. She became known for her ethereal qualities and her moral purity, and is one of the most celebrated ballerinas in history.\nStory.\nThe ballet opens with Bertram, Robert le Diable's father, entering the ruined cloister of Sainte-Rosalie. He summons the ghosts of nuns who have violated their vows. They rise from their graves. He orders them to seduce his son Robert into accepting a deadly talisman. The Abbess Helena orders the ghosts to waltz. In spite of their sacred vows, the nuns waltz. The dead nuns give themselves over to unholy thrills.\nRobert enters. The nuns hide, but return to prevent his escape. Robert stands terrified before a saint's tomb. The Abbess lures him towards the talisman in the saint's hand. Robert seizes it. The nuns continue their dance,fluttering like white moths. Their graves open and they sink into the earth. Stone slabs slide into place, covering the dead. A choir of demons is heard.\nBackground.\nBallet of the 18th century was based on rational thought and classical art. The French Revolution however ushered in a period that brought romantic ballet to the stage. Trapdoors, gas lighting, and other elements that became associated with the romantic ballet had been used in the popular theaters on the Paris boulevards for some time. Such elements would gain official sanction and prestige at the Paris Op\u00e9ra in the middle decades of the 19th century.\nA ballet on a \"Robert le Diable\" theme was danced in Paris before Her Highness Mlle de Longueville in 1652. \"The Ballet of the Nuns\" however was something entirely new in concept to audiences on the ballet's opening night. Henri Duponchel, managing director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, was in charge of visual effects at the Op\u00e9ra. He wanted to demonstrate the venue's recently installed gas lighting. Its reflectors produced a stronger, more keenly directed light than ever before. Working with him was Pierre Ciceri, chief scenery designer. Ciceri was inspired by either the Saint-Trophime cloister in Arles or the cloister of Monfort-l'Amaury for the ballet's moonlit setting.\nThe theme of the ballet is passion and death, and love beyond the grave. The scene is night rather than day, and Gothic Europe rather than the classical world of Greece and Rome. After almost 100 years of rational thought, audiences were clamoring for the mysterious, the supernatural, the vague, and the doomed. The story of the ballet is about a knight who slips into a cloister at midnight to steal a talisman from a dead saint's hand that will allow him to win a princess.\nHans Christian Andersen included the scene in one of his novels. Andersen writes of the scene, \"By the hundred they rise from the graveyard and drift into the cloister. They seem not to touch the earth. Like vaporous images, they glide past one another ... Suddenly their shrouds fall to the ground. They stand in all their voluptuous nakedness, and there begins a bacchanal.\" The nuns were not completely naked, but Andersen did capture the essence of the scene.\nOpening night.\nOpening night was spoiled by a falling gaslight and a trapdoor that would not close properly. A piece of scenery fell, narrowly missing Taglioni. The curtain was brought down. The ballerina assured everyone she was unharmed. The curtain rose and the performance continued. It ended in a triumph for Meyerbeer, the Taglionis, and Dr. Louis V\u00e9ron, the Op\u00e9ra's new manager. \nDr. V\u00e9ron had recently been awarded the Paris Op\u00e9ra as a private enterprise. He had great faith in Taglioni. He raised her salary to an unprecedented 30,000 francs a year. Her father was named ballet master with a three year contract. V\u00e9ron's boldness was rewarded when Taglioni fulfilled her promise and became a great star.\nReception.\nThe audience took prurient delight in the scandalous \"Nuns\". A reviewer for the \"Revue des Deux-Mondes\" wrote:A crowd of mute shades glides though the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they shake off the cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What a pleasure to see these light women.\n\"Nuns\" was the first \"ballet blanc\" and the first romantic ballet. The opera was performed 756 times between 1831 and 1893 at the Paris Op\u00e9ra. French Impressionist Edgar Degas painted the ballet scene several times between 1871 and 1876. \nUnder her contract, Taglioni was to appear in \"Nuns\" about a dozen times. She left after six. It is possible that the erotic implications of the nuns' ballet did not set well with her. She may have been reluctant to appear in a ballet within an opera. A foot injury and the accidents that marred the first performance may have given the ballerina pause for thought. Bad press directed at her father may have caused Taglioni to withdraw. Taglioni was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, who danced the role 232 times. \nThe Danish choreographer August Bournonville saw Fitzjames's performance as the Abbess in Paris in 1841. He based his own choreography, which was used in Copenhagen between 1833 and 1863, on this. His choreography has been fully preserved. It represents the only record of the original.\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow's future wife Fanny Appleton wrote, \"The diabolical music and the dead rising from their tombs and the terrible darkness and the strange dance unite to form a stage effect almost unrivaled. The famous witches' (nuns) dance in the freezing moonlight in the ruined abbey, was as impressive as expected ... They drop in like flakes of snow and are certainly very charming witches with their jaunty Parisian figures and most refined pirouettes.\" \nCritic and dance historian Andre Levinson writes, \"The academic dance had been an agreeable exercise to watch. Now, [ballet] clarified matters of the soul. Ballet was a divertissement (an entertainment, a distraction). It became a mystery.\" Kisselgoff writes, \"... the preoccupation with the supernatural that characterized so much of 19th-century ballet could be traced to the success of the \"Ballet of the Nuns\" in Meyerbeer's first production at the Paris Op\u00e9ra\"."}

Inside is a purple velvet cap with an ermine border. The Imperial State Crown includes many precious gems, including 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies.\nThe crown includes several famous jewels. The cross at the top is set with a stone known as St. Edward's Sapphire, a sapphire taken from the ring (or possibly coronet) of Edward the Confessor. The Black Prince's Ruby (actually a spinel) is set on the front cross patt\u00e9e; the famous Cullinan II, or Lesser Star of Africa, is set on the front; and the back band contains the Stuart Sapphire. The crown also contains Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Pearls.\nWhen not in use, it is kept with the other Crown Jewels on display at the Jewel House in the Tower of London."}

The term refers to the following objects: the crowns, sceptres (with either the cross or the dove), orbs, swords, rings, spurs, the royal robe or pall, and several other objects connected with the ceremony.\nMany of these descend directly from the pre-Reformation period and have a religious and sacral connotation.\nThe effect of the English civil war.\nAfter the death of James I, Charles I came to the throne. His many conflicts with parliament, stemmed from his belief in the divine right of kings. The many religious conflicts in his reign triggered the English Civil War. After six years of war, Charles was defeated and executed by the parliamentarians. Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector of England and, less than a week after the king's execution, the monarchy was abolished. The newly created English Republic found itself in a desperate financial state after the war. To raise funds the 'Act for the sale of the personal estate of the King,Queen and Prince' was put forward. Trustees were appointed to value the jewels and sell them to the highest bidder. The most valuable of these objects was the Tudor State Crown, valued at \u00a31,100 (\u00a31,740,000 as of 2011); it was set with 28 diamonds, 19 sapphires, 37 rubies and 168 pearls.\nCrowns.\nThe present collection of Crown Jewels contains various crowns, some of which are used by every Sovereign, others being made personally for Sovereigns or for the Queen's Consort. Typically the crown of a King has a slightly pointed arched top, while that of a Queen has a slightly bowed top.\nKoh-i-Noor.\nThe Koh-i-Noor diamond was given to the East India Company by the former rulers of Punjab in 1849. It became part of the British Crown Jewels when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India in 1877. It also contains the Lahore Diamond (22.48 carats) from the Treasury of Lahore given to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851. and a 17-carat (3.4 g) diamond given to Queen Victoria by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1856. The crown is now on display along with the other British Crown Jewels in the Tower of London."}

Birds have no more than four toes, inherited together with over a hundred anatomical features from theropod dinosaurs. These four toes are arranged into four main patterns.\nParts of the leg.\nKnee joint.\nThe bird knee joint between the femur and tibia (or rather \"tibiotarsus\") points forwards, but is hidden in the feathers. The backward-pointing \"heel\" (ankle) that is easily visible is a joint between the tibiotarsus and the tarsometatarsus.\nTarsometatarsus.\nThe tarsometatarsus is the third segment of the leg. Only birds have this. It evolved from bones of the ankle in their ancestors. The tarsometatarsus is the extended foot area, which gives the leg extra lever length.\nScales.\nThe scales of birds are made of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found on the toes and sometimes further up on the ankle. The scales and scutes of birds are thought to be homologous with those of reptiles, and feathers have developed from the scales of Archosaurs."}

This energy is called the activation energy. When two or more molecules are mixed, they will hit each other. If they hit with enough energy to go through the transition state, they will react and form new molecules. At the transition state, new bonds are formed while the old ones are broken. In a graph or a drawing, the transition state is often marked with the double dagger \u2021 symbol.\nIt is very difficult to study a transition state. This is because it is so high in energy that the molecules will stay in that form for a very short time, usually femtoseconds. It is important not to confuse transition states with intermediates. Intermediates are found at minimum points of energy, and they can live for a very long time. Like a transition state, however, an intermediate is between reagents and products of a reaction.\nStudying transition states is very important to understand reaction mechanisms. There are theories and computer programs that can be used to calculate how the transition state looks like. This is a part of chemical kinetics."}

He wrote features and columns for alternative newspapers, MC\u2019ed the first love-ins in Los Angeles, edited a collection of material from the underground press, \"The Hippie Papers\" (1968) and wrote a history of rock and roll, \"The Rock Story\" (1970).\nLeaving \"Rolling Stone\" temporarily in 1969 to write \"Elvis: A Biography\" (1971), it was while then serving as the magazine\u2019s London correspondent (1972) he began researching his Morrison biography, \"No One Here Gets Out Alive\". It was rejected by more than 30 publishers before publication in 1980, when it topped the \"New York Times\" bestseller chart and was credited by many with helping kick-start the Doors\u2019 revival as well as inspiring a new publishing genre, the rock biography. A sequel to the Elvis biography, \"Elvis: The Final Years\" (1981) followed, along with biographies of Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, Yoko Ono, and Raquel Welch, the latter of which was authorized but not published.\nHe moved to Honolulu, where he edited a monthly newsletter about Hawaiian music and dance and published several books taking Hawaiian culture as their subject, including \"The Hula\" (1981), a history; \"How to Make Your Own Hawaiian Musical Instruments\" (1988); \"Elvis in Hawaii\" (2002); and \"Don Ho: My Life, My Music\" (2007).

The fruits contain a lot of starch - much like potatoes; they are ground to make flour, which can then be used for baking.\nAncestors of the Polynesians found the trees growing in the northwest New Guinea area around 3,500 years ago. They gave up the rice cultivation they had brought with them from Taiwan, and raised breadfruit instead. They took the trees with them wherever they went in the Pacific. The exceptions were Easter Island and New Zealand: both places were too cold to grow the trees. Their ancient eastern Indonesian cousins spread the plant west and north through insular and coastal Southeast Asia. In historical times, it has also been widely planted in tropical regions elsewhere.\nThe Mutiny on the Bounty was caused by breadfruit trees: In 1787, William Bligh was ordered to load a number of these trees on Tahiti and to ship them to the Caribbean; there they would serve as a cheap food for the slaves working on plantations. The main plantations at the time were those of sugarcane. This was the first attempt a government made to grow an economically important plant at a different location. The attempt failed, because the seamen did not understand why the drinking water supply was used to water the plants; they threw the plants overboard.\nBligh was able to ship the trees in a second voyage: Arriving in the Caribbean, he faced a different problem: The slaves there did not accept breadfruit as a replacement for cereals. Bligh won the Royal Society medal for his efforts, even though the introduction was not entirely successful. Although most slaves refused to eat the new food, breadfruit was accepted into the cuisine of Puerto Rico."}

It occupies what was once the site of a chapel. Louis XIV wanted the Hercules Room to be a showcase for a large painting by Paolo Veronese. The architect Robert de Cotte began working on the room in 1710. Work was completed in 1736. The Room has been the scene of many glittering events in the history of Versailles.\nState Room.\nThe large room is on the ground floor (first floor) of the Palace. It measures 18m x 14m x 45m. A chapel once stood on the site. The Hercules Room connects the royal chapel and the North Wing of the palace with the Grand Apartment of the King. Architect Robert de Cotte started work on the room in 1710. The project was set aside in 1715 when Louis XIV died. Work resumed in 1724. Louis XV hired architect Jacques Gabriel, marble worker Claude-F\u00e9lix Tarl\u00e9, and sculptors Jacques Verberckt and Fran\u00e7ois-Antoine Vass\u00e9 to complete the room. The room is in the style of the Hall of Mirrors. \nPaintings by Veronese.\nLouis XIV wanted this room to be a showcase for a large painting by Paolo Veronese called \"Meal at the House of Simon the Pharisee\". This picture was painted for the refectory (dining hall) of the Servite Convent in Venice in 1570. In 1664, the Doge gave it to Louis XIV. He wanted the king to support him in a war with the Turks. Veronese's \"Eliezer and Rebecca\" hangs above the fireplace on the wall opposite \"Simon\". \n\"Simon\" is a large painting. It measures 4.5 m x 9.7 m. The painting was once displayed in the Apollo Gallery of the Louvre. It was hung in the Hercules Room in 1730. It was removed in 1832. It was sent at that time back to the Louvre. In 1961 \"Simon\" was returned to the Hercules Room. In 1994 the painting was restored.\nCeiling.\nThe room was completed in 1736 with a painted ceiling called \"Apotheosis of Hercules\". This was painted by Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne. The painting gave the room its name. The King was pleased with the ceiling. He appointed Lemoyne First Painter. Lemoyne however did not live long enough to enjoy the honor. He committed suicide shortly after the appointment. \nThe coving is decorated with representations of the Four Princely Virtues: Justice, Fortitude, Constancy, and Courage. These are separated by Cupids pointing to the Labors of Hercules. In the center of the ceiling, Hercules arrives in his chariot on Mount Olympus. Jupiter offers his daughter Hebe in marriage to the hero. Mars and Vulcan observe the fall of demons and vices. Apollo sits on the steps of the Temple of Memory.\n\"Apotheosis\" is the largest ceiling painted on canvas in Europe480 square meters of surface area. It depicts some 140 figures representing the gods and goddesses of Olympus. They have gathered for the arrival of Hercules after his successful labors raised him to the rank of God. The piece was seen as a metaphorical allusion to the merits of the French King."}

The clock shows the time, the day of the week, the month, the year and the moon's quarter. In the crystal globe at the top, the planets can be seen moving around the sun according to Copernicus.\nThe clock was designed by Claude-Sim\u00e9on Passemant, the King's engineer. It was made by the clock-maker Louis Dauthiau. The bronze casing was made by Jacques and Philippe II Caffi\u00e9ri. The clock was used to determine the first official time system throughout the kingdom. The entire fixture measures over two meters tall.\nThe Academy of Science examined and approved the clock in August 1749. The Duc de Chaulnes presented it to Louis XV on 7 September 1750. It was put in the clock cabinet in 1754. The room actually got its name because of the large astronomical clock dials in the wainscoting. These clocks displayed the sunrises and moonrises every day. The king's scientific interests led him to upgrade that daily experience by having the Passemant clock installed in the room.\nIn 1692, the room was an Antechamber and part of Louis XIV's Art Cabinet. In 1738, it was remodeled into an oval-shaped drawing room. In 1760, it found its present form. The paneling is by Verberckt and Rousseau.

They began in England and Wales during the 17th century. The first use of the word \"workhouse\" was in a report by the mayor of Abingdon in 1631 AD on the building of a workhouse in the town.\nThe beginnings of the workhouse go back to the Poor Law Act of 1388. This was designed to help solve a shortage of workers after the Black Death. It made it difficult for them to move about the country, and stopped them from looking for higher paid work somewhere else. This led to the state being responsible for the welfare of the poor. After the Napoleonic Wars there was a lot of unemployment. There was also unemployment caused by machines taking over work from farm workers. In the 1830s' there was also a series of bad harvests. These things put too much pressure on the existing ways of looking after poor people. \nNew laws were passed, the New Poor Law of 1834, to try to deal with the problem. People would only be given help if they went into the workhouse to live. Some places hoped to make a profit from the workhouse by using the free labor of the people. Most did not have skills to get normal jobs, so workhouse jobs included breaking rocks into small stones, breaking bones to make fertilizer, or pulling apart old rope to reuse the fibre. This old rope, known as oakum, was used to pack joints in ship building to keep them watertight. A metal spike was used to unpick the rope, and the nickname for the workhouse was the spike.\nLife in a workhouse was not meant to be easy. It was made hard so only the very poor with no hope of finding work would go there for help. However the workhouse did provide free medical care and education for the children. This sort of help was not available to poor people outside the workhouse system.\nTowards the end of the 1800s,' the workhouses became filled with the old and sick, rather than unemployed poor people. In 1929 the laws were changed and the workhouses became hospitals. Some workhouses were renamed Public Assistance Institutions. These finally disappeared when the National Assistance act of 1948 was passed."}

It hangs in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, France.\nHistory.\nManet painted \"The Fifer\" after a trip to Spain he made in 1865. There he discovered the work of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. Manet reflected the influence of Spanish painting in \"The Fifer\". The painting was rejected by the jury of the Paris Salon in 1866. The painting was exhibited in 1867. Manet died in 1883. In 1884, \"The Fifer\" was seen at the major retrospective exhibition of Manet's work organized as a tribute.\nThe rejection by the Salon jury caused the writer \u00c9mile Zola to publish a series of articles in defense of Manet in the newspaper \"L'\u00c9v\u00e9nement\".\nBetween 1873 and 1893, the painting was held by Jean-Baptiste Faure, a French composer and baritone, friend of Manet. In 1893, it was returned to the collection of art dealer Durand-Ruel. The painting was acquired in 1894 by Count Isaac de Camondo. It remained in his collection until 1911. That year it was donated to the French state. The painting was intended for the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. It was not exhibited to the general public until 1914.\nIn 1947, the painting was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume. This museum is a showroom located in the Jardin des Tuileries and belonging to the Louvre. It remained there until 1986. It then was brought to the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay with the rest of the Impressionist paintings in the Louvre. It can currently be seen in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\nAnalysis.\nManet portrayed an anonymous character: a teenage musician of the band of the Imperial Guard. The lad was sent to Manet by commander Lejosne. He was \"treated like a grandee of Spain.\" Additional models may have also posed for the figure. The likenesses of both L\u00e9on Leenhoff (Manet's stepson) and Victorine Meurent (Manet's preferred model) have been seen in the boy's face and figure.\nSandra Orienti declares, \"\"The Fifer\" is one of Manet's most famous paintings, and it is also one of his most daring works: here ... can be found a synthesis of all that is most complex in his vocabulary.\" She points out that the band boy's uniform is painted in red, black, and white with decorations in dull gold. The figure and its dress contrasts with the vague, undefined background. The lad has no support for himself except himself. \"[h]is form ... seems to create a double dimension, the first being the small figure of the boy, the second his eyes and the spectator's eyes meeting between the rather crudely painted eyelids.\""}

It was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1869. The painting depicts four figures. On the left is Berthe Morisot, who became in 1874 the wife of Manet's brother, Eug\u00e8ne. In the centre is the painter Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemet. On the right is Fanny Claus, a violist. The fourth figure in the background is possibly Leon Leenhoff, Manet's stepson. It was sold by Gustave Caillebotte in 1884. It hangs at this time in Paris at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\nInspiration and description.\nThe painting was inspired by \"The Majas at the Balcony\" by Francisco Goya. It was created at the same time and with the same purpose as \"Luncheon in the studio\". The three characters were all friends of Manet. They seem to be disconnected from each other. Berthe Morisot, on the left, looks like a romantic and inaccessible heroine, the young violinist Fanny Claus and the painter Antoine Guillemet seem to display indifference. The boy in the background is Manet's stepson, L\u00e9on. Just behind the railings, there are a hydrangea and a dog with a ball.\nA study for \"The Balcony\", \"The Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus\", is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The portrait\u2019s subject is Fanny Claus, the closest friend of Manet\u2019s wife Suzanne Leenhoff. This unfinished portrait was painted as a study for the finished picture. \nProvenance.\nFollowing Manet\u2019s premature death in 1883, the portrait was bought in a studio sale by the artist John Singer Sargent. The portrait had only been seen once in public since it was first painted in 1868. In 2012 the Ashmolean Museum succeeded in raising the funds to acquire it and keep it permanently in a public collection in the United Kingdom.\nReception.\nThis was the first time Berthe Morisot posed for Manet. Manet's \"Luncheon in the studio\" was the work of an innovator but \"The Balcony\" was not. Unlike Morisot, the three other figures are pale and undistinguished. Orienti writes, \"Guillemet looks pompous and stupid, Jenny Clauss a stereotype, and the painting as a whole seems to suffer from the uneven distribution of the figures.\" The press considered the painting \"discordant\". The contrast of colors (the background completely black, the white faces and clothes, the blue tie of the man, and the green railings) contributes to create an atmosphere of \"mystery\"."}

Some reach several millimeters in length, making them among the largest single celled organisms. As in many freshwater protozoans, Stentor has a contractile vacuole. Because the concentration of salt inside the cell and in the surrounding freshwater is different, Stentor must store water that enters it by osmosis and then discharge it from the vacuole. They can regenerate, and small fragments can grow into full organisms. Each cell has one (often elongated) macronucleus and several micronuclei. Having two types of nuclei is charcteristic of ciliates."}

There are two main subgroups, the Euglenoidea \"euglenids\" and Kinetoplastea \"kinetoplastids\". Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around 1540 \u00b5m in size, although some euglenids get up to 500\u00a0\u00b5m long.\nMost Euglenozoa have two flagella, parallel to one another in a pocket-like structure. In some there is a cytostome or mouth, used to eat bacteria or other small organisms. This is supported by a microtubule from the flagellar bases; two other tubules support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell.\nSome other Euglenozoa feed through absorption, and many euglenids have chloroplasts and so get energy by photosynthesis. These chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain chlorophylls \"A\" and \"C\", and other pigments, so are probably evolved from those of a captured green alga. Reproduction occurs only by cell division. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane remains intact, and the spindle microtubules form inside it.\nThe group is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella. In addition to the normal supporting microtubules, each contains a rod (called \"paraxonemal\"), which has a tubular structure in one flagellum and a latticed structure in the other.\nClassification.\nThe euglenozoa are generally accepted as monophyletic. They are related to Percolozoa; the two share mitochondria with disk-shaped compartments, which only occurs in a few other groups.\nBoth probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the Excavata. This grouping has been challenged."}

They are molecules which have the same atoms and bonds but different stereochemistry in at least one, but not all, of their chiral centres. Diastereomers can have very different properties even though they look similar. This is different from enantiomers, that have exactly the same properties except when in a chiral environment like the human body.\nEvery chiral centre in a molecule has two possible ways of putting the groups in space. With only one chiral centre, there are two enantiomers. With two chiral centres, you can form 4 different isomers. When all chiral centres are changed at the same time, two pairs of enantiomers are formed. When only one chiral centre is changed at a time, sets of diastereoisomers are formed. With more chiral centres the possibilities are many more.\nDiastereoisomers which are different at only one of more chiral centres are called epimers. For example, -Threose and -Erythrose (see picture) are diastereomers because they are different at only one of two chiral centres. Because of this they can also be called epimers."}

This is because if this step is changed the reaction can go much faster. This can be done for example by using a different reagent or changing the temperature or pressure. Changing the conditions for any other step of the mechanism will not change the overall speed of the reaction at all.\nIn the rate equation, which is an equation to calculate the speed of the reaction from the concentration of molecules, usually the only step that is important is the rate-determining one."}

Gustave Geffroy described this effect in his review of the exhibition (Le Journal, November 26, 1900), speaking of \"this minuscule pool where some mysterious corollas blossom,\" and \"a calm pool, immobile, rigid, and deep like a mirror, upon which white water lilies blossom forth, a pool surrounded by soft and hanging greenery which reflects itself in it.\"\nReferences.\nReproductions available in many sizes at Art Studio Gallery La Fayette"}

The paintings are of Monet's flower garden at Giverny. They were the main focus of Monet's work during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts. The paintings are on display in museums all over the world, including the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Carnegie Museum of Art and the National Museum of Wales, among others.\nAs part of his extensive gardening plans at Giverny, Monet had a pond dug in his garden and planted with lilies in 1893. He painted the subject in 1899, and thereafter it dominated his art. He worked continuously for more than twenty years on a large-scale decorative series, attempting to capture every observation, impression, and reflection of the flowers and water. The series captures the blooms at different times of the day, and under different atmospheric conditions. After much hesitation, Monet exhibited a group of 48 water-lily paintings in 1909 at the Paris gallery of his art dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel. The series became an enormous financial, popular, and critical hit. By the mid-1910s, Monet had achieved a completely new, fluid, and somewhat audacious style of painting in which the water-lily pond became the point of departure for an almost abstract art."}

Every pot, each piece of crockery has been given distinct treatment. As Diderot wrote of Chardin, \"it is not white, red, or black pigment that you mix on your palette, it is the very substance of objects.\"\nChardin's subjects were popular with all classes of society, including the aristocracy. The National Gallery writes, \"Perhaps their appeal rested in their sense of order, of things in their proper place. Chardin anticipated the popularity of paintings of \"sensibility,\" which increased from the 1740s on, telling a colleague that \"one uses color, but one paints with sentiment.\""}

It took place in July 1976 in Entebbe, Uganda. An Air France airplane was hijacked on 27 June 1976. The Palestinian terrorists wanted the release of prisoners held in Israel and four other countries. Many of the hostages were later released but 106 Israelis and Jews were still held. Israeli special forces planned and executed a daring long-range rescue of the remaining 106 passengers on 4 July 1976. 102 of the passengers were rescued. Lt Col Yonatan Netanyahu, who led the mission, was the only rescuer to be killed.\nHijacking.\nOn 27 June 1976 Air France flight AF-139 was hijacked by four Palestinian people. One third of the passengers on the airplane were Jewish. Two of the hijackers were members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The other two were members of the Baader-Meinhof gang from Germany. The hijackers forced the plane to go to Entebbe. \nThe plane landed at Entebbe at 3 AM on June 28th. Three more people joined the hijackers. At noon, the passengers were moved to an old terminal building. Idi Amin, dictator and President of Uganda went to the airport to meet with the hostages. He told them he was working to get them free. He said the military of Uganda was there to help keep them safe. The next day, the hijackers said that if 53 other terrorists were not released from prisons, they would start killing the hostages. Of these 53 people, 13 were in prisons in France, West Germany, Kenya, and Switzerland. The other 40 were in Israel. The hijackers said the prisoners had to be released by 2 PM on July 1. \nOn June 29th, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) held a meeting to discussed a raid to free the hostages. There were 3 major problems with this. The first problem was that Uganda was 2000 miles away. The fact that the plane was owned by a French company was also an issue. The third main issue was the fact that only one third of the passengers were Jewish. And of these, not all of them were from Israel. \nIt was learned the next day that Idi Amin was, in fact, not working to free the hostages. He was working to support the PFLP. This caused other problems for the rescue mission. They now had to worry about the Uganda military at the airport. A large number of the hostages were released on July 1st. The hijackers still held 106 passengers who were all Israeli or Jews. The hostages who were freed were flown to Paris and London. The government of Israel said that they would free the prisoners held in Israel. Because of this, the hijackers agreed to not start killing the hostages until July 4th. Lt Col Yonatan Netanyahu was put in charge of the Israeli mission to free the remaining hostage. Training began the next day for the mission. It was done using information they had gotten from the released passengers. An old home movie taken in Entebbe was used to show them more about the layout of the airport.\nThe raid.\nSoon after noon on July 3rd, four C-130's took off from Israel with the troops for the rescue mission. Their path to Entebbe was carefully selected to avoid being seen by Russian ships or Egyptian radar. At 11 PM the plane reached Entebbe. A black Mercedes limousine and 2 Land Rover were used to lead troops to the airport. The vehicles were the same as those Amin was known to use. The Mercedes had Ugandan flags and all 35 commandos wore Ugandan uniforms. As they got near the building where the hostages were kept, two sentries went to stop them. Netanyahu told his vehicles to slow down. When the two sentries were in range, he had his troops shoot them with silenced weapons. One of the sentries was hit and killed. The other was not killed. When he tried to use his weapon, Israeli troops quickly killed him with AK-47s. This caused much noise and the hijackers knew something was now happening. The element of surprise was believed to be lost. The troops moved quickly to the building. The terrorist outside the building ran inside yelling \"The Ugandans have gone nuts - they're shooting at us!\" The element of surprise was still there. The terrorists did not realize it was Israeli troops attacking them. \nOutcome.\nIt took the Israelis about 10 minutes to clear the building. The entire raid lasted just 99 minutes. The Ugandan soldiers and all seven terrorists were killed. Of the 106 passengers, three were killed. 102 were rescued. One of the hostages was not found. Netanyahu had been shot in the chest and 10 other of the Israeli military were injured. Netanyahu was the only one to die. The Israelis also destroyed at least 8 Russian-built MIG fighters. This was a quarter of Uganda's air force.\nThe hostages were then flown to Nairobi, Kenya. While there, some of the injured were treated by Israeli doctors. At least two people were moved to a hospital there. The rescued hostages were then taken back to Israel. It was later learned that one woman, the missing hostage, had been removed from the airport for medical reasons. She was later killed by the Ugandans. Her body was not returned to Israel until 1979. \nWhile officially known as Operation Entebbe, it is more often referred to as Operation Jonathan, named after Yonatan Netanyahu."}

The story and words were written by Nahum Tate. The music was written by Henry Purcell. The opera was probably written about 1684-1685. \"Dido\" is Purcell's only true opera. It was possibly modeled on John Blow's \"Venus and Adonis\". Blow's piece was written and staged about the same time. Marc-Antoine Charpentier's little French operas may also have served as models. French music was appreciated at the English court.\nThe opera was intended for performance at the court. The death of Charles II may have caused it to be postponed however. The first performance occurred in a Chelsea girls' school run by Josias Priest (the dancing master at court) in 1689. Tragedy and comedy are deftly combined in \"Dido\". The lovers' scenes are tense with emotion. The witches' scenes are filled with comical cackling and mischief-making.\nThe story of the opera is taken from Virgil's \"Aeneid\". It tells of the Trojan Aeneas' tragic love for Dido, the Queen of Carthage. The opera manuscript has been lost or destroyed. Research and performance rely on earliest printed copies. Some music is believed missing from these early copies. That music is composed afresh by modern composers in Purcell's style. Sometimes music Purcell composed about 1685 is inserted into the score to make up for the lack of the original music. \"Dido and Aeneas\" is Purcell's best known work.\nBackground.\nThe words and story (the libretto) of \"Dido and Aeneas\" were written by Nahum Tate. The music was written by Henry Purcell. The date for the opera's composition is usually given as 1689. This has been called into question. The work is closer to the music Purcell composed in 1684-1685. The true date of composition probably falls in the middle-1680s rather than 1689. In the middle of the decade, Josias Priest's Chelsea boarding school for young ladies performed John Blow's \"Venus and Adonis\". This little opera was possibly the model for Purcell's work.\nThe opera was probably intended for a performance at court. The death of Charles II in February 1685 may have been a reason to postpone the performance. There is no evidence that the opera was performed at court at this time. The opera was first performed in 1689 at Priest's Chelsea girls' school, rather than at court. The themes, the mythological subject, the plentiful dances, the pastoral setting, the formal concision are all indicative that it was intended for a noble audience rather than the common man. It is more likely these short forms of opera appealed to the English. They preferred song and spoken dialogue.\n\"Dido\" may have been modeled on the little French operas of Marc-Antoine Charpentier. It may have been modeled on John Blow's \"Venus and Adonis\", too. \"Venus\" was composed and staged about the same time as \"Dido\". The action is carried forward in \"Dido\" by arioso passages. Choruses and dances are used to frame the various scenes. The intensity of emotion in the scenes for the lovers is contrasted with the grotesqueness of the witches' scenes. Comedy and tragedy are carefully balanced in \"Dido\". This balance reveals Purcell's sense of drama.\nAfter 1705, the opera disappeared from the stage. Occasionally, there were concert performances. In 1895, the first staged version in modern times was performed by students of the Royal College of Music to mark the bicentenary of Purcell's death.\nStory.\nThe story of the opera is taken from the \"Aeneid\" by the Roman poet Virgil. Virgil was trying to create a national epic for the Romans in the way Homer did with \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\" for the Greeks. Aeneas is the son of Venus and Anchises of Troy. He flees his home after it is sacked by the Greeks. Ahead of him lies a seven year journey to Italy. Fate has decreed he will found a new nation. Aeneas arrives in Carthage. Queen Dido is mourning her dead husband, a man to whom she swore eternal fidelity. She has fallen in love with Aeneas, and he with her.\nMusical numbers.\nThe original manuscript does not exist. Research depends upon the earliest printed copies. Some pieces are believed missing. Sometimes music Purcell composed in the middle 1680s is put into the score to balance the loss. Sometimes the missing music is composed completely afresh in Purcell's style.\nThe opera's tragic outcome is hinted at almost at once in the accompaniment to the Queen's Act 1 aria. The modulation in the ground bass from C minor to G minor on the words \"I languish till my grief is known\" anticipates the key of Dido's lament in Act 3. Purcell uses a ground bass at other moments: Dido's two arias (Acts 1 and 2) and in the aria \"Oft she visits\" in Act 2. This aria references Actaeon's tragic death by his own hounds. The word \"ground\" suggests that which will cover Dido after her death.\n Act 1.\nAct 2.\nAct 3."}

For a general reaction , the rate equation is: \nHere, [A] and [B] are the concentrations of A and B. \"x\" and \"y\" depend on which step is rate-determining. If the reaction mechanism is a very simple one, where A and B hit each other and then go to products through one transition state, then \"x\"=\"a\" and \"y\"=\"b\". \"k\" is the rate constant of the reaction. This changes with temperature, pressure and other conditions. \nThe rate equation is a differential equation. If it is integrated, then an equation which tells how the concentration of reagents and products changes with time is found.\nIn special cases, it is very easy to solve the equation and find \"k\". For example, in a first-order reaction the equation is:\nIntegrating gives:\nSo, a plot of formula_4 against time \"t\" gives a straight line with a slope of formula_5.\nSometimes, experiments can be made so that the reaction looks like a first-order one. If the concentration of one reagent is kept at the same high value then it can be thought of as a constant. The equation becomes formula_6 where k' is the pseudo-first order rate constant. Then the method above can be used to calculate k'."}

For a company or organization, it is important to choose the right people from the beginning. This is because human resources are often a very important part of a business.\nRecruitment has many different steps. First, the company needs to advertise that it has a job available. People then send an application. This usually includes a curriculum vitae, which is a summary of what a person has done until now in their life. The best applicants are selected and they come for an interview. This might also include some further tests or exercises to do. The person chosen is then given an offer of a job. Finally, they can choose to take it or not.\nThere are many ways of doing recruitment. Some companies go to consultants, who know where and how to find the best people. Universities and schools often have a group of people that tells the students about getting a job. At other times, a company might really want a person that is very good at a job but works for another company. They can then ask directly to this person, maybe offering more money.

By definition, schist contains more than 50% platy and elongated minerals, often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar. Schist often contains garnets.\nThe individual mineral grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen by the naked eye. Schist is characteristically \"foliated\", (~leaf-like) meaning the mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word \"schist\" is derived from the Greek word \"\u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd sch\u00edxein\" meaning \"to split\". This refers to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.\nMost schists have been derived from clays and muds which have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of shales, slates and phyllites as intermediate steps. Certain schists have been derived from fine-grained igneous rocks such as basalts and tuffs. Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. \nSchists are named after their mineral constituents, such as garnet schist, tourmaline schist, glaucophane schist, etc. \nSchists are frequently used as dimension stone. Dimension stone is stone that has been selected and cut to specific shapes or sizes."}

The man lived in the 4th century BC, in what is known as the \"Pre-Roman Iron Age\". The head and face were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim. Twelve years before the discovery of Tollund Man, another bog body, Elling Woman was discovered in the same bog.\nBelow the body was a thin layer of moss. Scientists know that this moss was formed in Danish peat bogs in the early Iron Age, therefore, the body was suspected to have been placed in the bog more than 2,000 years ago during the early Iron Age. C14 radiocarbon dating was performed: It indicated that he died in approximately 375-210 BC. The acid in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface, had preserved the delicate soft tissues of his body.\nExaminations and X-rays showed that the man's head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved. The Silkeborg Museum estimated that he must have been approximately 40 years old, and about tall, at the time of his death. This means he was relatively small, even for the time. It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog.\nOn the first autopsy report in 1950, doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible marks in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck. There was no mark, however, at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found more evidence to support these findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (as they often are in hanging victims), radiography showed that the tongue was distended\u2014an indication of death by hanging.\nThe stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents. The scientists discovered that the man's\nlast meal had been a kind of porridge made from vegetables and seeds, both cultivated and wild: barley, linseed, gold of pleasure (\"Camelina sativa\"), knotweed, bristlegrass, and chamomile.\nThere were no traces of meat in the man's digestive system, and from the stage of digestion it was apparent that the man had lived for 12 to 24 hours after this last meal. In other words, he may not have eaten for up to a day before his death. Although similar vegetable soups were not unusual for people of this time, two interesting things were noted:\nBog bodies dry up and decompose rapidly, when they are taken out of the bog. Because of the facial expression, and the general state of the head, the decision was taken to expose the body. At the time, the head was preserved using Polyethylene glycol, the only material available. This method did not permit to preserve the body; it dried up and decayed. Today, the head is attached to a copy of the body. Both feet and the right thumb were also in a good state of preservation when the body was found in the 1950s. For this reason, they were kept in formaldehyde for analysis later. In 1976, the Danish Police Force made a finger-print analysis, making Tollund Man's thumb print one of the oldest finger-prints on record. Tollund Man is exposed in the Silkeborg Museum."}

He was a United States Army soldier of Hispanic-Asian descent, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Vietnam War. Despite being severely wounded, Smith inspired his men to beat back an enemy assault.\nEarly years.\nSmith was an American of Hispanic/Asian-Pacific American descent (his Hispanic blood being precisely of Puerto Rican origin). He was born in the town of Wahiaw\u0101 which is in the center of Oahu Island in the County of Honolulu. There he received his primary and secondary education. He joined the United States Army in 1953 and was stationed in various countries overseas, among them was Okinawa.\nDuring his stay in Okinawa, he met a Hawaiian born WAC by the name of Jane and soon they were married. They established their home in a military post in Tacoma, Washington and had two daughters.\nVietnam War.\nOn July 23, 1966, Smith was sent to the Republic of Vietnam and served as Platoon Sergeant of the 1st Platoon, Company C, 2d Battalion, 8th Infantry of the 4th Infantry Division. The division performed combat operations in the western Central Highlands along the border between Cambodia and Vietnam. The division experienced heavy combat against North Vietnamese Army (NVA) regular forces in the mountains surrounding an area called Kontum.\nOn February 16, 1967, Sergeant Rodrigues Smith was leading his platoon in a reconnaissance patrol, when suddenly it came under attack. NVA forces attacked the patrol with machinegun, mortar and rocket fire. Despite the fact that he was wounded, he coordinated a counterattack by positioning his men and distributing ammunition. He was struck by a rocket, but continued to expose himself in order to direct his men's fire upon the approaching enemy. Even though he died from his wounds, his actions resulted in the defeat of the enemy.\nFor his actions, he was recommended for the Medal of Honor. The family received the medal from the hands of Secretary of the Army Stanley R. Resor because President Lyndon B. Johnson was ill at the time. However, after the ceremony, which was held at the White House, the family which included his widow Jane and two daughters, Kathleen 10 and Pamela 6, were taken to President Johnson's bedroom.\nMedal of Honor citation.\nCitation:\nPostscript.\nSergeant First Class Elmelindo Rodrigues Smith's remains were buried with full military honors in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.

She was later found by Jean-Baptiste du Barry who owned a casino and trained women to be courtesans. Jean-Baptiste du barry made Jeanne B\u00e9cu his mistress.\nOfficial mistress of Louis XV.\nAs time passed, Jeanne became well known with powerful people in the kingdom. She had many clients in the king's court. The king noticed her and had her brought his bedroom many times. Since she was a commoner and did not have a royal title, she could not be a ma\u00eetresse-en-titre. The king was worried what people would think of him being with a commoner, so the kind ordered that Jeanne be married to a man who had a noble title. On 1 September 1768, Jeanne was married to du Barry's brother, Comte Guillaume du Barry. After the wedding, Jeanne was made Louix XV's official mistress. She lived in a small room above the king's room. Jeanne was very lonely since some people still considered her a commoner."}

The division was created in 1900 for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the locality of Parramatta. The name \"Parramatta\" is an Aboriginal word for \"the place where the eels lie down\". \nThe division is in the western suburbs of Sydney. It includes Constitution Hill, Dundas Valley, Granville, Harris Park, Holroyd, Mays Hill, North Parramatta, Oatlands, Old Toongabbie, Parramatta, Rosehill, Rydalmere, Telopea, Wentworthville, Westmead and parts of Dundas, Ermington, Guildford, Merrylands, Merrylands West, Northmead, North Rocks, Pendle Hill, South Granville and South Wentworthville.\nThe division lies between Labor voting areas of western Sydney and the Liberal areas on the North Shore. Because of this, any change to the boundary can change the political balance in the seat. For example, in the 2006 boundary change, Parramatta shifted from marginally Labor to marginally Liberal (as defined by the Australian Electoral Commission). Nevertheless, as was expected Julie Owens held the seat for the ALP with an increased majority.\nMembers.\nFrom 1901 to 1921 the Division was represented by Sir Joseph Cook who was the Prime Minister of Australia from 1913-14. There have been several by-elections for Parramatta when the members have resigned. In 1921 Cook resigned to became Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, in 1958 Beale resigned to become Australian Ambassador to the United States, in 1964 Barwick resigned to become Chief Justice of the High Court, Bowen resigned in 1973 to become a judge in the NSW Court of Appeal."}

It was founded by Wilhelm von Humboldt. He was the German Minister of Education at the time. Von Humboldt organized Germany's system of education which is still used today. The first building was donated by Frederick William III of Prussia. The University opened its doors in 1810 as the University of Berlin. \nHistory.\nAt the time of its founding in 1810, there was pressure to make the new university both practical and industrial. Von Humboldt wanted it to be a center for the pursuit of truth in learning. In the end he won out. The University was set up under his principles. In 1828 it was formally renamed the Frederick-William University. The university was named in honor of the reigning monarch, Frederick William III of Prussia. The university offered the traditional faculties of law, medicine, theology and philosophy. Emperor William made several establishments at the University. One of these was the professorship of \"American History\". It is now called the \"Theodore Roosevelt professorship\". It required the position be filled by an American professor who must lecture in German. In an interview with then president Butler of Columbia University, a second professorship in Berlin was established with a lectures in English taught by a German professor.\nFrom 1933 to 1945, under Nazism, the university lost many of its Jewish scholars and students. Some were killed. On May 10, 1933 many university books were burned. Before World War II Humboldt was still the major university in Berlin. After the war the university was greatly weakened. It reopened in January 1946. It was in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Many students and faculty wanted to continue their education free of communist government control. With the help of the US Army and donations from the United States government, the Free University of Berlin was established in 1948 in West Berlin. \nIn 1949 the university was given its present name, Humboldt-University of Berlin (), to honor the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt. The university underwent a number of changes by the government of East Berlin in the 1950s. But it regained its importance as a major center of learning.\nThe university today.\nThe university got its start reflecting the principles of the great educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt. It pioneered many new academic disciplines. In spite of its problems in the 20th century, the university has returned to its founding principles. There are 260 degree courses offered. The university has an academic staff of about 2,170 and 35,000 students. it is currently ranked 80th among the world's universities. It has been informally called \"Berlin University\" throughout its history. Also, informally, the \"University of Linden\" () after its location."}

First, it does not describe a disaster scenario, but shows only trends. Secondly, it is to be read in the light of experience since 1972, namely, that all of humanity has responded to the report, but with a delay of 20 to 40 years. Thirdly, it offers not only future scenarios, it makes concrete proposals on how the individual should respond to emerging developments.\nGlobal forecast.\nRanders's reflections are based on two central questions: \"What will happen to the consumer over the next 40 years?\" and \"Under what conditions - in which social and natural environment - this future consumption will take place?\" (P.78) He uses computer models to make sure feedback effects are not overlooked.\nThe population will decline from about the 2040th.\nThe working population will peak around 2030.\nProductivity will grow, but there will be obstacles.\nThe gross domestic product will grow, but more slowly.\nInvestments - forced and voluntary - will increase.\nThere will be new costs.\nCosts for adaptation to the new climate and for repair of disasters will explode.\nThe state will become more involved.\nConsumption will stagnate and decline in some places.\nThe energy efficiency will continue to increase. Energy demand is expected to rise, but not indefinitely. CO2 emissions from energy consumption will peak in 2030. The temperature will rise by more than two degrees, and that will cause serious problems.\nThe race for natural resources will be hard, the biocapacity of the world will be used more and more. The cities become richer sources of raw materials for metal than the mineral deposits in nature (urban mining). In the same way that zoos have already become the last refuge for many endangered species, parks will take over this role for nature in general.\nRanders argues the global gross domestic product will fail to increase as it has in the past because of population decline, and general aging and declining productivity growth.\nThe Internet will give rise to a completely new understanding of private and public. Knowledge will not be a scarce resource any more, but that will not lead to more rational decisions in most of the cases, because the knowledge on its own is not sufficient to change behavior when strong interests are involved. Therefore, probably there will be needed a \"green team\" to enforce environmental behavior, like today, the peacekeeping forces (blue berets)."}

Alkynes are hydrophobic: this means they dissolve well in organic solvents but not in water. \nAlkynes are more reactive than usual hydrocarbons. For example, they are more reactive than alkenes in many reactions. If the alkyne is at the end of a molecule, it is easy to remove the proton with a strong base. Then, the alkyne can be used in addition reactions. For example, it can be added to a ketone. Alkynes are also easy to reduce to double bonds. They can be made into both \"trans\" and \"cis\" double bonds. Alkynes are also used a lot in pericyclic reactions.\nStructure.\nAlkynes have a 180 degrees angle between the two carbon atoms. For this reason, they do not like to be in a cyclic compound. Some examples of alkynes are shown below."}

These three atoms are bonded, or stuck together, in a small ring. The ring of atoms is shaped like a triangle, with all edges of the same length. Because of this small ring, an epoxide is very reactive. \nEpoxides can be made by oxidation of alkenes. There are many ways to do this. Usually, a peroxide is used. Some ways can even make only one enantiomer of the epoxide.\nEpoxides like to react with nucleophiles. Usually, when an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile, the first thing it does is break one of its chemical bonds between the oxygen atom and the carbon atom. This makes the triangular ring pop open. With the ring open, the nucleophile gets stuck onto one of the carbon atoms. On the other carbon, the left over oxygen attaches to a hydrogen atom, turning into an alcohol. This is very useful, because it is easy to change an alcohol into many other functional groups.\nEpoxides are useful because with them very complicated molecules can be made quickly. Epoxides are extremely useful for making many other compounds. That is because oxygen, which is in an epoxide, is such a great functional group. Once you have made an epoxide, you can make alcohols, ethers, and halohydrins, among other things."}

{"id": "382086", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382086", "title": "Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece", "text": "Homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece was regarded as contributing to morale. The chief example is the Sacred Band of Thebes, a unit said to have been formed of same-sex couples. The Spartan tradition of military heroism has also been explained in light of strong emotional bonds resulting from homosexual relationships. Various ancient Greek sources record incidents of courage in battle and interpret them as motivated by homoerotic bonds.\nPhilosophical discourses.\nSome Greek philosophers wrote on the subject of homosexuality in the military. In Plato's \"Symposium\", the interlocutor Phaedrus commented on the power of male sexual relationships to improve bravery in the military:\nHowever, the \"Symposium\" is a dialectical exploration of the nature of true love. Phaedrus' views are soon found to be inadequate compared to the transcendent vision of Socrates, who:\nXenophon did not criticize the relationships themselves. He ridiculed militaries that made them the sole basis of unit formation:\nSocial aspects.\nAccording to tradition, the Greeks structured military units along tribal lines. This was a practice attributed to Nestor in the Homeric epics. The Theban military commander Pammenes, however, is supposed to have advocated military organization based on pairs of lovers:\nPlutarch himself appears to doubt the veracity of these accounts. It is to be doubted if Pammenes actually organized military units along homosexual lines. Eventually the Greek city-states joined Pammenes' views on the most effective order of unit formation. The practice soon proliferated. City-states that had originally frowned upon the idea reversed opinions on the basis of their own experiences.\nOne such example is supposed to have taken place during the Lelantine War between the Eretrians and the Chalcidians. The account is given by Plutarch in a dialogue.\nIn a decisive battle the Chalcidians called for the aid of a warrior named Cleomachus. Cleomachus answered their request. He brought his lover along with him. He charged against the Eretians and brought the Chalcidians to victory at the cost of his own life. It was said he was inspired with love during the battle. Afterwards the Chalcidians, erected a tomb for him in their marketplace. They reversed their negative view of homosexuality, and began to honor it. The fundamental point seems to be that the superiority of heterosexual love does not imply condemnation of homosexuality. Aristotle attributed a popular local song to the event:\nThe importance of these relationships in military formation was not without controversy. According to Xenophon, the Spartans abhorred the thought of using the relationships as the basis of unit formation for placing too much significance on sexuality rather than talent. This was due to their founder Lycurgus who attacked lusts on physical beauty, regarding it as shameful. Xenophon asserted that in some city-states the lovers would not even have conversations with one another. He said this type of behavior was horrible because it was entirely based on physical attractions:\nNonetheless city-states that employed the practice in determining military formation enjoyed some success. The Thebans are said to have had one such regiment as the core of their entire army. They attributed this group called the Sacred Band of Thebes for making Thebes the most powerful city-state for a generation until its fall to Philip II of Macedon. Philip II of Macedon was so impressed with their bravery during the battle he erected a monument that still stands today on their gravesite. He also gave a harsh criticism of the Spartan views of the band:\nOne of the prominent Greek military figures enjoying such a relationship was Epaminondas, considered the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus however does not have anything to say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society. Plutarch, consistently with his heterosexual message, then goes on to tell how love also inspires women to great courage: \"And here, methinks, we have very opportunely mentioned Alcestis; for although the temper of women has little to do with Mars, Love many times drives them to daring attempts beyond their own nature, even to death.\""}

It was included the two main cities of Spalato (Split) and Trau (Trogir) and their hinterland, extending north to Sebenico (\u0160ibenik). Additionally there were the islands of Lissa, Curzola, Lagosta, Cazza, Pelagosa (these last 3 removed from the \"Italian Province of Zara\") and Meleda.\nThe province bordered only the Independent State of Croatia. The \"Capoluogo\" (administrative center) was Spalato, where there was the \"Tribunal\" and was edited the Italian newspaper \"San Marco\". There was even the football team \"AC Spalato\", that substituted the local Hadjuk ruled by Slavs.\nMost of the population of the newly created province was Croatian, but there was even a small -but historical- community of nearly 3,000 Dalmatian Italians (only in Spalato city they were more than 1,000 in 1940, even if greatly reduced from the first half of the XIX century when they were more than one third of the city's population ).\nHistory.\nItalian General Vittorio Ambrosio conquered in a few days all the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, and occupied in April 1941 the area of southern Dalmatia around Spalato (called officially \"Split\" only since 1919).\nThe new Italian province of Spalato was created by order of Mussolini the next month, with the \"May 19 Treaty between Italy and Croatia\". Valerio Paolo Zerbino was named \"Prefect\" of the Province of Spalato, serving from June 1941 to August 1943.\nThe governorship of the Spalato province (and all the Governorate of Dalmatia) was held by Giuseppe Bastianini until January 1943 when he was recalled to Italy to join the cabinet; his place as governor was taken by Francesco Giunta.\nIn summer 1941 the Italian government started a policy of \"Italianization\" in all the Governorate of Dalmatia. New Italian schools were opened in Spalato. Administrative personnel from Italy moved to Spalato and Trau (nearly 6,700 Dalmatian Italians took refuge in Italy after the creation of Yugoslavia in 1919, and many of them were offered work if they returned to settle with their families in the Governorate of Dalmatia). Bastianini started needed public works, building hospitals, sewage systems and roads in the area. Even the \"Bank of Italy\" opened a branch in Spalato \nThousands of Jews from Croatia took refuge inside the Governorate, and many moved to the Spalato area mainly in 1942.\nIn August 1943 the Governorate administrative personnel left Dalmatia and returned to the Italian peninsula: the area was ruled by the Italian military until mid-September 1943 when was occupied by German troops. After the disappearance of the province, all the area -that under Italian presence was spared the bloody guerrilla that happened in Ante Pavelic's Croatia- started to be involved in the massacres of the Yugoslavian civil war during WWII.\nAfter WWII nearly all the 3000 Dalmatian Italians of Spalato were forced to emigrate from Tito's Yugoslavia, but in 2012 there were still 100 in the city.\n\"Comuni\" of the Province of Spalato.\nThe \"Comuni\" (Municipalities) of the Province were 13 (2 of them, Spalato and Curzola, had a special status):"}

It is Latin for \"smaller dog\" or \"the lesser dog\". The astronomer Ptolemy listed it when he made a list of 48 constellations in the 2nd century. Both Canis Minor and Canis Major (which means \"larger dog\" in Latin) represent dogs that follow the hunter named Orion in Greek Mythology.\nThe main shape of Canis Minor is made by two stars, which are named Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris) and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris). These stars are the only stars in Canis Minor that have a magnitude that is brigher than 4. Procyon has a magnitude of 0.39, which means that it is the seventh brightest star in the night sky. It is also very close to Earth, since it is only 11.4 light years away. Procyon is a binary star, which means that it actually has two stars that orbit each other. It has a white dwarf star and a white type F5 main-sequence star. Gomeisa has a magnitude of 2.9. Its temperature is 11,500\u00b0K, which means that it is very hot. It is a blue type B8 main-sequence star. It is 3 times the mass of the sun and 250 times more luminous than the sun. "}

Asked of a person, it is a question about motive: \"why did you do this?\". Asked of a natural event, it is a question about natural causes (causation).\nIn science, an explanation is the link between an event which is a cause, and a second event, which is an effect. The phrase \"cause and effect\" refers to this. The relationship between the two events is known as causality. The philosopher Mario Bunge said, \"We do not rest content with finding facts but wish to know why they should occur rather than not\".\nAs a general rule, explanations move from what we know to what we do not know. This is important because it explains why different kinds of people may need different explanations. \"A child, a lay person and an expert may need different explanations of the same thing, since what is already familiar to them will differ\".\nThe asking of questions depends on language, and is peculiar to humans. It starts very soon after a child learns how to speak. A kind of game which young children play with adults is the 'why game'. Every parent gets the experience of their child asking a never-ending stream of why questions, until at last the adult says \"Well, it just is!\"\nThere can be plenty of argument about whether or not an explanation is appropriate, and if so, whether it is correct. If one asks why the sun gives out heat and light, to say \"because it is daytime\" is not appropriate, even if it might indeed be daytime. The real answer was not known until the 20th century. Before then peoples like the ancient Egyptians thought it was caused by a god (Aten).\nTypes.\nDifferent kinds of why questions need different kinds of explanations. including:\nGeneral explanations.\nThese add something to human knowledge.\nPersonal explanations.\nA personal question like \"Why did you do that?\" clearly asks for an explanation. What that explanation might be depends on context: it all depends on circumstance. This type of question about motives only applies to the people concerned.\nMany kinds of explanations are made up of more than one type. An explanation can be valid or invalid or a combination of both. Some explanations may appear reasonable, but turn out to be misleading or wrong."}

The group became infamous when its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers. Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists were sentenced to repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions. As Pankhurst's oldest daughter Christabel took the helm of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew. Eventually arson became a common tactic among WSPU members, and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family. In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU, among them Pankhurst's daughters Adela and Sylvia. The family rift never healed.\nWith the advent of the First World War, Emmeline and Christabel called an immediate halt to militant suffrage activism in support of the British Government's stand against the \"German Peril\". They urged women to aid industrial production and encouraged young men to fight. In 1918 the Representation of the People Act granted votes to women over the age of 30 and the WSPU was disbanded.\nPankhurst transformed the WSPU machinery into the Women's Party, dedicated to promoting women's equality in public life. In her later years she became concerned with the 'Bolshevik menace' and\u00a0\u2013 unhappy with the political alternatives\u00a0\u2013 joined the Conservative Party. She died in 1928, 17 days before women got equal voting rights and was commemorated two years later with a statue in London's Victoria Tower Gardens."}

They are very common in fats and oils. They sometimes have a very strong, nice smell. They can be used to make perfumes. Polyesters are found in plastics.\nEsters can also do many reactions. It is very easy to change the ether part of the molecule with another similar one. It is also possible to reduce the ester to a ketone or an alcohol, which can do many different reactions. Nucleophilic addition is also a good reaction, though a bit more difficult than with ketones.\nThere are many ways to find out if a molecule has an ester group. Infrared spectroscopy gives very sharp signals, which are different from other carbonyls. Carbon NMR spectroscopy has similar characteristics."}

In German, the camp was called \"Konzentrationslager (KZ) Buchenwald.\" It was built in Germany in 1937, and stayed open until 1945. Buchenwald was one of the first and largest concentration camps built in Germany.\nThe Nazis sent people from all over Europe and the Soviet Union to Buchenwald. There, they were prisoners and did forced labor in weapons factories.\nAfter the Allies won World War II, the Soviet Union took over Buchenwald and some other parts of Germany. From 1945 to 1950, they used Buchenwald as an internment camp. They called it NKVD Special Camp Number 2. (The NKVD was the Soviet police organization that ran the camp.) On January 6, 1950, the Soviets handed over Buchenwald to the East German Ministry of Internal Affairs.\nToday, what is left of Buchenwald is a memorial. There is also a museum there.\nHistory.\nThe Nazis built Buchenwald on the \"Ettersberg\" (Etter Mountain), near Weimar, Germany, in July of 1937. They named the camp \"Buchenwald,\" which means \"beech forest\" in English. On the camp's main gate, they wrote \"Jedem das Seine\" (\"Each to their own\u201d).\nBetween April 1938 and April 1945, about 238,380 people were sent to Buchenwald. These prisoners included people from many different countries. They also included many Allied prisoners of war (POWs). Over 56,000 prisoners died at Buchenwald.\nPeople.\nCamp commandants.\nKarl-Otto Koch (1 August 1937\u2013July 1941).\nBuchenwald\u2019s first commandant (camp leader) was Karl-Otto Koch. He ran the camp from 1937 to July 1941. His second wife, Ilse Koch, became well known as \"Die Hexe von Buchenwald\" (\"the witch of Buchenwald\") for the terrible ways she treated the prisoners. Koch made the prisoners build a zoo at Buchenwald, with a bear pit (\"B\u00e4renzwinger\").\nEventually, Koch was put in prison at Buchenwald himself. At first, two Nazi officials named Prince Waldeck and Dr. Morgen accused Koch of encouraging murder. Later, Koch was also charged with corruption, embezzlement, black market dealings, and using the camp's workers to meet his own needs. Other camp officials were also charged, including Ilse Koch.\nKarl Koch was tried and sentenced to death. He was executed by a firing squad on April 5, 1945. This was just one week before American soldiers arrived and took over Buchenwald.\nAfter the war, Ilse Koch was sentenced to four years in jail. At first, her sentence was cut down to two years and she was set free. However, after this, she was arrested again and sentenced to life in prison by the new German government. She killed herself in jail in September 1967.\nHermann Pister (1942\u20131945).\nBuchenwald's second commandant was Hermann Pister. He controlled the camp from 1942 to 1945, when it was taken over by American soldiers.\nAfter the war, Pister was tried in the Nuremberg Trials, and was sentenced to death. However, in September 1948, before he could be executed, Pister died of a heart problem.\nTypes of prisoners.\nThe Nazis sent prisoners from all over Europe and the Soviet Union to Buchenwald. These included:\nWomen in Buchenwald.\nSomewhere between 500 and 1,000 women prisoners were kept at Buchenwald. First, in 1941, twenty female political prisoners were brought to Buchenwald from Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. They were forced to work as sex slaves in the camp's brothel.\nHowever, most of the female prisoners were sent to Buchenwald in 1944 and 1945 from other concentration camps. They were sent mainly from Auschwitz, Ravensbr\u00fcck, and Bergen Belsen. Later, all the women prisoners were sent to Buchenwald's many female satellite camps (smaller camps around Buchenwald).\nIlse Koch was the head supervisor (\"Oberaufseherin\") of 22 other female guards and hundreds of women prisoners in the main camp. More than 530 other female guards worked in Buchenwald's many other, smaller camps (\"subcamps\"). Only 22 women served or trained in the main Buchenwald camp, compared to over 15,500 men.\nAllied airmen.\nWhen the Nazis captured soldiers from Western Allied countries, they almost always sent them to prisoner of war camps, not concentration camps. However, they did keep a group of 168 airmen (flyers) at Buchenwald for two months. These men were from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Jamaica. They got to Buchenwald on August 20, 1944.\nThese airmen's planes had crashed in France, which Nazi Germany controlled. The airmen were sent to Buchenwald, not a POW camp, because the Nazis said they were spies and \"terror bombers.\"\nAfter the war, one airman remembered arriving at Buchenwald:\nThe airmen were treated and abused in the same way as the other prisoners at Buchenwald. Two airmen died there. Then, in October 1944, the airmen were sent to Stalag Luft III, a regular POW camp. The airmen who were accused of being \"terror bombers\" were going to be executed at Buchenwald after October 24. They were saved by officers of the Luftwaffe (the German air force), who visited Buchenwald. When they got back to Berlin, these officers made sure the airmen were sent to a regular POW camp, and not executed.\nDeath toll at Buchenwald.\nCauses of death.\nThe Nazis' goal for camps like Buchenwald was \"Vernichtung durch Arbeit\" (\"extermination through labor\"). This meant that prisoners were being sent to Buchenwald to be worked to death.\nBecause of the terrible living conditions in the camp, illness was very common and spread quickly. Prisoners were also starving. Because of this combination of illness and starvation, many prisoners were actually \"worked to death\" as the Nazis had planned. However, many other inmates died from executions, experiments by Nazi doctors, and other causes.\nSummary executions of Soviet POWs (executions without a trial) were also done at Buchenwald. In 1941 and 1942, at least 1,000 men were chosen to be killed and were sent to Buchenwald, where they were immediately shot in the back of the head.\nNazi doctors also did experiments on prisoners at Buchenwald. For example, in 1942 and 1943, they used 729 prisoners to test a vaccine for typhus. This meant the prisoners were given the vaccine, and then given typhus on purpose. 154 of these prisoners died. In another experiment, Nazi doctors wanted to see how much of a certain poison was needed to kill a person. They gave four Russian POWs the poison. When the POWs did not die, they were \"strangled in the crematorium\" and then \"dissected\" (cut apart to study their bodies). Doctors also burned other prisoners very badly with white phosphorus to test whether a medicine would help similar wounds caused by bombs. After the war ended, at the Nuremberg Trials, one of these doctors defended himself by saying that while he was a doctor, he was also a \"legally appointed executioner\" (meaning the law allowed him to kill people).\nNumber of deaths.\nThe SS left behind records of how many prisoners came to the camp and how many left. They recorded how many prisoners were let go, sent to another camp, or died. These records say that 33,462 prisoners died at Buchenwald. However, these records may not be completely true. For example, before 1944, when the SS killed prisoners, they often wrote down that the prisoners were \"transferred to the Gestapo,\" not that they were killed. Also, starting in 1941, many Soviet POWs were executed in mass killings. These POWs would be killed as soon as they got to the camp, and were never added to the camp's records. This means they were not listed among the 33,462 dead.\nOne former Buchenwald prisoner, Armin Walter, counted the number of people who were killed by being shot in the back of the head. Walter's job at Buchenwald was to set up and care for a radio system at the place where people were executed. He counted the number of people who were killed and hid the information. He says that 8,483 Soviet prisoners of war were shot and killed.\nWhen all these deaths are added up, the total number of people who died at Buchenwald is about 56,545. This number includes:\nThis total of 56,545 deaths means that 24% of the prisoners who were sent to Buchenwald died.\nLiberation.\nOn April 4, 1945, United States soldiers took over Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald's smaller camps. Ohrdruf was the first Nazi camp liberated (taken over and freed) by U.S. soldiers.\nTwo days later, the Nazis started trying to evacuate (move everybody out of) Buchenwald. They made thousands of prisoners go on forced marches toward other camps that the Americans had not yet reached.\nA Polish engineer named Gwidon Damazyn, who had been a prisoner since March 1941, had set up a secret short-wave radio. On April 8 at noon, Damazyn and Russian prisoner Konstantin Ivanovich Leonov sent a message in Morse code to the Allies. The message had been written by the leaders of the prisoners' underground resistance movement (a group of prisoners who tried to fight the Nazis in secret). It said:\nThe text was repeated several times in English, German, and Russian. Damazyn sent the English and German messages, and Leonov sent the Russian version. Three minutes after Damazyn sent the last message, the headquarters of the Third United States Army answered:\nDamazyn fainted after getting the message.\nAfter learning this news, Communist inmates attacked the camp's watchtowers and killed the guards who were still at the camp. They used guns they had been collecting since 1942 (one machine gun and 91 rifles).\nUnited States soldiers arrived at Buchenwald on April 11, 1945 at 3:15 P.M. (The clock at the entrance gate is now permanently set to this time). The soldiers were given a hero's welcome.\nLater that day, United States soldiers took over Langenstein, one of Buchenwald's smaller camps. There, they freed over 21,000 prisoners. They also ordered the mayor of Langenstein to send food and water to the camp, and rushed in medical supplies from an American field hospital.\nOn Thursday, April 12, 1945, some journalists arrived at Buchenwald. The journalists included Edward R. Murrow, whose radio report about seeing Buchenwald was broadcast on CBS and became one of his most famous:\nSoviet Special Camp Number 2.\nBetween 1945 and February 10, 1950, the camp was run by the Soviet Union. They used it as a prison camp called Special Camp Number 2.\nThe Soviet Union held 28,455 prisoners, including 1,000 women, at Special Camp Number 2. Soviet records say that 7,113 of these prisoners died. They were buried in mass graves in the woods around the camp. Their families were not told they had died.\nPrisoners at Special Camp Number 2 included: \nThe NKVD (the Soviet police organization that ran the camp) would not let the prisoners talk to anyone outside the camp. The NKVD also did not try to figure out whether the prisoners were guilty.\nOn January 6, 1950, the Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs, Sergei Nikiforovich Kruglov, decided that the East German Ministry of Internal Affairs would take over all of the NKVD special camps, including the one at Buchenwald.\nBuchenwald is destroyed.\nIn October 1950, Buchenwald was destroyed. The main gate, the crematorium, the hospital block, and two guard towers were left standing. All prisoner barracks and other buildings were torn down. Many of them have been rebuilt.\nJust days after the camp was liberated in 1945, freed prisoners built a monument to honor the people who died at Buchenwald. It was made of wood and was meant to be temporary. Eventually it was replaced by a monument made of stainless steel. The surface of this monument is kept at , the temperature of human skin, all year round.\nA second monument was also built in 1958, near where prisoners had been buried together in mass graves.\nBooks about Buchenwald.\nSome people who survived being imprisoned at Buchenwald have written about what happened to them. These people include:\nVisit from President Obama and Chancellor Merkel.\nOn June 5, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Buchenwald. Elie Wiesel and Bertrand Herz, two survivors of Buchenwald, went with them. During the visit, President Obama said at as a child, he had heard stories about Buchenwald from his great-uncle, who was part of the 89th Infantry Division. This Division was the first group of American soldiers to reach the Ohrdruf forced labor camp, one of Buchenwald's smaller camps."}

An amine can be thought of coming from ammonia. The difference is that the three hydrogens in ammonia are changed to any group or atom. If only one of the hydrogens is changed, the amine is called primary. If two are changed, the amine is called secondary. If all three are changed then it is called tertiary. \nSometimes, a fourth group can be added to the nitrogen. This is called a quaternary ammonium cation. This is not an amine but is a salt. If one of the groups on the nitrogen is a carbonyl group, then the molecule is called amide. This has very different properties.\nAmines are used a lot in chemistry. Since the nitrogen has a lone pair, it can do many reactions. It can take protons away from some acids. It can also be a nucleophile. It can be changed into imines and other functional groups.\nAmines are also found in many proteins. They are a part of every amino acid."}

Boys and men may sometimes wear hair to shoulder length. Longer than that is rare for men of most cultures.\nExtremely long hair (usually waist length or longer) is normally only found in females. The reason is that the female hormonal system affects the growth of their hair, just as the male hormonal system supports facial hair growth. This is also the reason young females can have longer hair than older women.\nHair length is measured (in centimeters or inches) from the line of the scalp on the forehead up over the highest point of the skull to the end of the hair. This method is not suitable for measuring hair length for people with a fringe. In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually described by the part of the body where the longest hair ends: \"chin level\", \"shoulder length\", \"mid-back level\", \"waist length\", \"hip-length\", \"classic length\" (extends to almost upper thigh-length, where the legs meet the buttocks), \"thigh-length\", \"knee-length\" and \"ankle/floor length\" hair.\nHair usually takes about 2\u20132\u00bd years to reach shoulder length. It usually takes about 4\u20135 years to grow to the waist (which is about 60-80\u00a0cm for most women) if left to grow.\nRecords.\nThe maximum hair length that is possible to reach is about 15\u00a0cm for infants (below the age of 1), about 60\u00a0cm for children (below the age of 13), and generally 100\u00a0cm for adults. Some individuals can reach excessive lengths. Lengths greater than 150\u00a0cm are frequently observed in long hair contests. Xie Qiuping had the longest documented hair in the world, measuring 5.627 m (18\u00a0ft 5.54 in) in May 2004.\nThe maximum hair length depends on the length of the period of hair growth for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for women with long periods of hair growth. Hair can grow continuously for between 2 and 7 years.\nSignificance.\nHead hair is maintained by natural selection after other body hair had been greatly reduced. The hair has at least two functions:\nCultures of men with longer hair.\nMany Native American men wore long hair before the arrival of western influences on their culture. The long-term preference of females of the tribe for longer male hair would have effect by long-haired males contributing more children than short-haired males."}
{"id": "382753", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382753", "title": "Pseudanthium", "text": "A pseudanthium (Greek for \"false flower\") or flower head is a special type of inflorescence. Many flowers are grouped together to form a flower-like structure. The real flowers (\"florets\") are generally small and greatly reduced, but can sometimes be quite large (as in the sunflower flower head).\nPseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower family (Asteraceae or Compositae). Their flowers are either \"ray flowers\" or \"disk flowers\". The disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium look like the centre of a normal flower. Flowers on the periphery have one large petal. This sytem is unique to this family. Either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some species: \"Senecio vulgaris\" lacks ray flowers and \"Taraxacum officinale\" lacks disk flowers. The pseudanthium has a whorl of bracts below the flowers.\nAt a glance, a pseudanthium (inflorescence) looks just like a normal flower, but closer inspection shows it is composed of multiple flowers. Thus, the pseudanthium represents an evolution of the inflorescence to a reproductive unit that may function in pollination like a single flower, at least in plants that are animal pollinated. The advantage of this \"flower\" is that it produces far more seeds than a normal flower, but needs only one act of pollination.\nRelated terms.\nHead&lt;br&gt;\nThis is an equivalent term for flower head and pseudanthium when used in the botanical sense.\nCapitulum (plural capitula)&lt;br&gt;\n\"Capitulum\" can be used as an exact synonym for pseudanthium and flower head. Its use is generally restricted to the Asteraceae family, though at least one source defines it as a small flower head. In addition to its botanical use as a term meaning flower head it is also used to mean the top of the sphagnum plant."}

A group or individual may use unethical methods to persuade others to believe and do what the manipulator(s) want. It often harms the person being manipulated. \nThe term has been applied to any tactic, psychological or otherwise, which undermines (damages) an individual's control over their own thinking, behaviour, emotions or decision making.\nTheories of brainwashing and of mind control were originally developed to explain how totalitarian regimes appeared to succeed systematically in indoctrinating prisoners of war through propaganda and torture techniques.\nHistory.\nSome authors have pointed out that the ideas of mind control can be found in all stages of human history. They are essentially the extreme use of techniques of religious conversion and propaganda which are widespread in human history.\nKorean War.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" records the earliest known use of \"brainwashing\" in an article Edward Hunter in \"Miami News\" published on 7 October 1950. During the Korean War, Hunter, who worked at the time both as a journalist before becoming a U.S. intelligence agent, wrote a series of books and articles on the theme of Chinese brainwashing.\nThe Chinese term (\"x\u01d0 n\u0103o\", literally \"wash brain\") was originally used to describe methodologies of coercive persuasion used under the Maoist regime in China. The methods aimed to change people's mindset so they became \"right-thinking\" members of the new Chinese social system.\nHunter and those who picked up the Chinese term used it to explain why, unlike in earlier wars, a relatively high percentage of American GIs defected to the enemy side after becoming prisoners-of-war. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British Army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their war-era imprisonment. The most prominent case in the U.S. was that of Frank Schwable, a prisoner in the war. While in custody, he confessed to having taken part in germ warfare.\nCults and the shift of focus.\nAfter the Korean War, mind control theories shifted in focus from politics to religion. From the 1960s an increasing number of youths started to come into contact with new religious movements (NRM). Some who converted suddenly adopted beliefs and behaviors that differed greatly from those of their families and friends; in some cases they neglected or broke contact with their loved ones. Those against cults explained these sudden and seemingly dramatic religious conversions as due to mind control. The media was quick to follow suit, and social scientists sympathetic to the anti-cult movement, who were usually psychologists, developed more sophisticated models of brainwashing. While some psychologists were receptive to these theories, sociologists were for the most part skeptical of their ability to explain conversion to NRMs."}

In 1706 Raja Ramjibon Rai established his capital here by filling the beel. Up until 1821 Natore was the central office of Rajshahi district. In 1845 Natore Mahakuma was established. Natore Municipality was established in 1869. Natore became a fullfledged district in 1984. \u201cIndigo resistance\u201d movements took place in this district during 1859 and 1860.\nHistory.\nNatore was the District Headquarters of Rajshahi since 1769-1825. Administrative Natore subdivision was established in 1825 under Rajshahi district, on the eve of the shifting of the HQ.\nDuring the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 a direct battle was fought between the Pakistani occupation army and the freedom fighters of Mukti Bahini on 29 March in which about 40 members of the Pakistani army including Major Aslam and Captain Ishaq were killed.

Fac. 2, Fig. 7 sign of the Holy Ghost... in the form of a dove.\nJoseph Smith taught: \"The sign of the dove was instituted before the creation of the world, a witness for the Holy Ghost, and the devil cannot come in the sign of a dove. The Holy Ghost is a personage, and is in the form of a personage. It does not confine itself to the form of the dove, but in sign of the dove. The Holy Ghost cannot be transformed into a dove; but the sign of a dove was given to John who had baptized Jesus to signify the truth of the deed, as the dove is an emblem or token of truth and innocence.\"\nIn Hebrew, Jonah (\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4) means dove. The \"sign of Jonas\" in Mat 16:1-4 is related to the \"sign of the dove\".\nAdditional symbolism of the Dove.\nThe Christian symbol of a dove with an olive branch in it\u2019s beak represents love and peace and comes from Genesis 8:6 - 12 which reads:\n\"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:...Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.\" \nDoves were also used in ancient Israel as Korban, or religious sacrifice within the tabernacle and temples. \n\"And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.\"\nIn the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean, doves were used as symbols for the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, the Phoenician goddess Tanit, and the Roman goddesses Venus and Fortunata.\nAdditional Scriptural References.\nPsalms 55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.\nPsalms 68:13 yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.\nSong of Solomon 2:14 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock\nSong of Solomon 5:2 Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.\nIsaiah 38:14 I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.\nJeremiah 48:28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.\nHosea 7:11 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart"}

It was painted in 1571. It measures 92.3 x 81.2\u00a0cm (36 5/16 x 31 15/16 in.) The picture is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. It is one of only three paintings signed by Clouet. The teenaged bather is unknown. It is possible that she is Diane de Poitiers, mistress of King Henry II of France when she was a teenager. Scholar Roger Trinquet suggested in 1966 that the teenaged lady is Mary Queen of Scots. The lady's face resembles other portraits of Mary, especially a drawing by Clouet depicting Mary in mourning. Trinquet believes the painting was intended as a satire for a Huguenot patron. The painting set a fashion for portraits of bathers.\nThe National Gallery writes: \"The masklike symmetry of the bather's face makes exact identification difficult; scholars have suggested that her aristocratic features indicate that she is one of several royal mistresses, most notable among them Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of Henry II. It is possible that the nude, a Venus type, represents ideal beauty rather than a specific individual. The contrast of the smoothly rendered nude figure to the intricate surface details of the fruit, draperies, and jewelry, presents a union of Flemish and Italian motifs that characterized French courtly art of the sixteenth century.\""}

It is based on the DC Comics superhero team the Justice League. It is the fifth part in the DC Extended Universe. The movie has a screenplay written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon.\nPlot.\nYears ago, Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons attempt to conquer and remake Earth through the combined energies of the Mother Boxes before they are foiled by a unified army that included the Amazons, Atlanteans and humans. After repelling Steppenwolf's army, the Mother Boxes are separated and hidden in locations around the world.\nIn the present, the world is in mourning following the death of Superman. Sensing humanity's fear, Steppenwolf and his Parademons return to Earth to resume their hunt for the Mother Boxes through kidnapping several employees of S.T.A.R. Labs, which is in possession of one box. Having investigated the kidnappings and encountered a Parademon himself, Bruce Wayne decides to move forward in recruiting his planned team of metahumans as he believes an invasion is coming.\nSteppenwolf manages to retrieve the Mother Box from Themyscira, prompting Queen Hippolyta to warn her daughter Diana Prince. Diana joins Wayne's group and informs him about Steppenwolf and the Mother Boxes. The two of them fail to persuade Arthur Curry and Victor Stone, but manage to recruit Barry Allen into the team. Stone later joins the group after his father Silas is among those kidnapped, and Steppenwolf attacks Atlantis to retrieve the second Mother Box.\nThe team receives intel from Commissioner James Gordon that the Parademons are traveling underground, and conclude that Steppenwolf's army is based in an abandoned facility. Although the group manages to rescue the kidnapped employees, the facility is flooded during combat, which traps the team until Curry rescues them, having decided to join them after Steppenwolf's attack on Atlantis. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box from S.T.A.R. Labs for the group to analyze. Wayne decides to use the Mother Box to resurrect Superman not only to help them fight Steppenwolf's army, but also to restore hope in humanity. Diana and Curry are hesitant about the idea, but Wayne forms a secret contingency plan.\nClark Kent's body is exhumed and placed in the waters of the Kryptonian ship, and Allen provides a strong energy blast to activate the Box and resurrect Superman. Superman, however, possesses few memories, and he attacks the group after Stone accidentally launches a projectile at him. On the verge of being killed by Superman, Wayne enacts his contingency plan: Lois Lane. Superman calms down and leaves with Lois to his family home where he reflects and tries to recover his memories. With the last Mother Box unguarded, Steppenwolf retrieves it with ease.\nWithout Superman to aid them, the remaining five heroes travel to a village in Russia where Steppenwolf plans to unite the boxes once again and reshape the world for his nephew Darkseid. The team fight their way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf, although they are unable to distract him enough for Stone to separate the boxes. Superman arrives and assists Allen in evacuating the city, as well as Stone in separating the Mother Boxes. The united heroes manage to defeat Steppenwolf, who, overcome with fear, is attacked by his own Parademons, before they are all taken away by a Boom Tube.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Wayne decides to rebuild Wayne Manor as a base of operations for the team and he and Diana agree that more heroes could join. Diana as Wonder Woman begins engaging more with the public. Allen manages to acquire a job in Central City's police department. Stone continues to explore and enhance his abilities with his father in S.T.A.R. Labs. Curry returns to Atlantis.

However, Galswintha was not happy, and wanted to go home and take back her dowry. King Chilperic refused, and murdered her. King Chilperic remmarried Fredegund, his first wife. Lots of tension was created between Fredegund and Brunhilda. In 575\u00a0C.E., King Sigebert was murdered by King Chilperic, and Brunhilda was exiled to Paris. Later, Brunhilda married Fredegund and Chilperic's son, Merovech. Brunhilda gained power, but Merovech and Brunhilda were split up by King Chilperic, and Brunhilda was exiled once more. In 585\u00a0C.E., King Chilperic died, believed to have been murdered by Fredegund. Fredegund started to favor Brunhilda. However, Brunhilda was caught by another of Fredegund and Chilperic\u2019s sons, Chlotar II. She was blamed for the murder of ten kings, including her husband, children, grandchildren, Merovech, and Chilperic. She was found guilty (even though she was not) and put to death in a very gruesome way; she was tied to the back of a wild horse and dragged to her death."}

He was the 105th mayor of New York City from January 1, 1978 through December 31, 1989. He was also part of the House of Representatives. He was a judge for the television judge show \"The People's Court\".\nEarly life.\nKoch was born on December 12, 1924 in The Bronx, New York to Yetta (n\u00e9e Silpe) and Louis Koch. They were a Polish-Jewish family from New Jersey. He was raised in both The Bronx and in Newark, New Jersey. Koch studied at the City College of New York and at New York University School of Law.\nCareer.\nThroughout his career, Koch signed many bills including one that allowed gays and lesbians to marry in New York City. Another well-known act he did in New York was that he helped try to find a cure for AIDS. He had many preventions and awareness programs. He was a Democrat. He ran for Governor of New York, but lost the election. His career began to slowly come to an end after Koch suffered a stroke in 1987. When he was a representative, he supported the Civil Right Act during the 1960s.\nPersonal life.\nKoch never married and had no children. Many thought Koch was gay because of the pro-LGBT policies he supported and because he never married.

Medical transcription means to do this for a hospital, doctor's office or other medical place.\nWhen doctors and nurses help someone in the hospital, they do not have time to write down what they saw or heard. So later they record what they saw and heard, so someone else can write it down. The notes are then added to the hospital's history. The person who does this as a profession is called a medical transcriptionist.\nPeople who do medical transcription normally work in hospitals, doctor's offices, old age homes, and other places where doctors and nurses work. \nThere is huge rise in outsourcing of Medical Transcription to other companies. In the United States this field of business is worth US$10 to $25 billion and growing 15 percent each year.\nBecause of rising costs of Medical Transcription it became recently popular to use different computer products (software) that can reduce transcription costs by as much as 50%. There is no available research about market share between in-house Transcription, outsourcing and software based.\nEducation.\nPeople who do medical transcription do not need as much education as doctors, but they need to know medical words and have basic medical knowledge. They normally go to school for 1 to 2 years. They study some of the things doctors study, plus English and typing. They also learn to use computers and other things needed for medical transcription.\nSome medical trainscriptionists go to school using only a computer by using the internet. These medical transcriptionists use tools like email and other things that let people work together from far away. Some people like to learn medical transcription this way more, because it lets you learn when you want to and sometimes saves money. This style of learning is not as common as learning transcription in a classroom.\nTo prove they have been trained properly, some medical transcriptionists get certification, which is like a badge showing that they are good at medical transcription. Most good certifications are offered by the AHDI. These are the CMT (Certified Medical Transcriptionist) and the RMT (registered Medical Transcriptionist) certifications. Once a medical transcriptionist has gone to school and gotten a certification, they are considered a good transcriptionist. \nPay.\nMedical transcriptionists normally make $20,000-30,000 a year in the US, or about $10-16 an hour. The ones who make the most make around $45,000 per year, or $21 an hour. "}

A deep dive is considered anything below a depth of about . This is still not very deep compared with the deepest parts of the ocean. Divers sometimes stay underwater for long periods of time. Sometimes they do work on oil wells and pipelines. Sometimes they explore sunken ships to see if they can retrieve items from the ship or help to bring the ship up to the surface. \nOne of the dangers of deep diving is decompression sickness.

Free divers practice holding their breath for long periods of time so that they can stay underwater longer.\nUsually free divers stay underwater for about 45\u00a0seconds. That allows them to explore about 30\u00a0feet underwater. Some freedivers can dive to over 100\u00a0metres (300\u00a0feet), and hold their breath for four minutes or longer.\nIn Greek, \u201cApnea\u201d means \u201cWithout air\u201d and free-diving is called \u201cApnea\u201d. Free-diving is similar to snorkeling, but divers need to hold their breath if they go in deep water. Free-diving doesn't need tools for breathing. Free-divers hold their breath until going up to the surface of the sea instead of using an air tank. Therefore, the most important part of free-diving is learning to breathe well. Most people can free-dive since it doesn\u2019t need a snorkel or scuba tank. However, free-divers condition their mind and body before going free-diving.\nHistory.\nPile of shells around dwellings of the Stone Age prove that people caught food under the water. Free-diving started by getting food or trading items, but it has developed as leisure, with divers taking photos today. Today, free-diving is widely practiced as a leisure sport like snorkeling and spearfishing. Anyone can go to the sea and see all kinds of sea animals. Also, free-divers can feel peaceful in the water. Free-diving has grown in the past 10 years by many people want to be with nature.\nPractice.\nLearning to breathe is the most important part of free-diving practice. The way of staying in the water longer is to practice breathing slow and deep. Divers breathe in for 5\u00a0seconds and breathe out for 10-15\u00a0seconds. To avoid over-breathing, they breathe out for a long time more than breathing in. Free-divers practice how to breath in the water, and they can start free-diving when they have a pulse under 80/bpm.\nRisks.\nFree diving to great depth is especially dangerous, but any diver who is not well trained can panic, or otherwise fail to return to the surface before they use up the oxygen in their body. They can lose consciousness from anoxia and drown. Professional free-divers can go in the water over 400\u00a0feet without any tools for breathing. But some free-divers die. On November. 17, 2013, Nick Mevoli blacked out after trying free-diving at a Bahamas competition. He never woke up again.\nFree-diving Tools.\nUnlike scuba-diving, free-diving needs several basic tools for seeing, breathing, and moving well in the water. Free diving equipment includes a mask, snorkel, fins, wetsuit and weightbelt. Free-diving tools help free-divers to experience more in the water.\n1) Mask.\nFree-divers choose a lightweight mask to fit their faces to swim comfortably in the water. \n2) Snorkel.\nAnother important tool is a snorkel which helps free-divers breathe when swimming close to the surface of the water. It is good to choose a flexible snorkel to avoid biting too hard and to focus on relaxing.\n3) Fins.\nIn addition, free-divers need a good fin for swimming better with small effort. Fins help free-divers to reduce using their energy and the heart rate. It helps to travel farther too. "}

It is a protected area of national importance. The caves were created by both surface water and underground spring water. The protected area includes the caves as well as the surrounding forests. The natural underground springs of warm mineral water are rich in carbon dioxide. They are used for spas in the nearby willage and spa resort of Teplice nad Be\u010dvou.\nThe caves are filled with aragonite and stalagmites which look like geysers. Other formations look like doughnuts. The bottom levels of the cave are filled with carbon dioxide. The temperature stays at 14\u00b0C all year, and the caves are the warmest underground places in the Czech Republic. The caves were discovered in 1912 and opened for the public in 1926. \nLocation.\nThe Zbra\u0161ov aragonite caves are on the bank of the Be\u010dva River. It is at an altitude of 250\u2013310 meters above sea level. It is part of large karst area which includes also Hranick\u00e1 gap. This is the deepest hole in the Czech Republic. It is across the river Be\u010dva under the National Nature Reserve at H\u016frka.\nMany of the buildings in the area threaten the karst system. Work is in progress to connect them to a sewerage system and remove all the septic tanks and cess pools.\nHistory.\nIn December 1912, workers at a local quarry uncovered a crack in the rocks. There was warm air coming out of the cracks. Brothers, Josef and Chrome \u010cen\u011bk, were interested in the karst formations in the area. They made the opening bigger, and in January 1913, climbed down a rope 42m into the dark underground space. The rope broke and both men were trapped in the cave. Their lamp was also broken in the fall, so they had to wait eight hours in the dark to be rescued. Over the next few years many other parts of the 1,322m cave system were explored.\nA new entrance into the cave was dug from the Be\u010dva valley. Electric lighting was installed in the cave and in 1926 it was open to the public. In 2002\u20132005 the caves were renovated. The paths and wiring were renewed. A huge amount of rock was removed. This rock debris had filled some natural cavities and hallways. It had been created at the time of original works and for economic reasons had not been carried out of the caves. During this renovation some parts of the system returned to their original form.\nGeology.\nThe geology of the area is made up of large blocks of rock. Valleys are short and form along the fault lines between these blocks. There is a layer of Devonian limestone more than 500m thick. This is covered with a younger layer Miocene sediments.\nThe caves developed from two completely different karst processes. The first was corrosion of surface and water that entered into the cracks in the limestone and created large underground spaces. The second was warm mineral water coming up from depths of up to 2 km. The aragonite and calcite in the cave is formed mainly by calcium carbonate. This can crystallize in three ways. The first is the mineral calcite, which is the most common and consists of cave fillings, such as stalactites, stalagmites, sinter deposits and valances. There are geyser stalagmites that are conical in shape and are a few feet high. These are not found anywhere else in the world. The second type of calcium carbonite is aragonite. This forms white needle-like crystals. Water and carbon dioxide are released. Vaterite, the third and rare form of calcium carbonate is not present.\nHydrology.\nThe area is drained by the river Be\u010dvou, which flows into the River Morava. With heavy rain the river can flood. The most devastating floods in Moravia were 5\u201316 July 1997. The flood water got into the cave, including the Marble Hall. At the same time the levels of mineral pools was raised and carbon dioxide gas reached the higher level caves. The gas in the visitor area was solved by installing a special suction device that keeps the composition of the air in the values \u200b\u200bset by the State Mining Administration (up to 1% CO2). The floods also damaged much of the technical equipment, but did not damage the cave's natural features.\nMineral water features in the spas in the two springs and spring Krop\u00e1\u010d. There is the RI borehole which is 60.40 meters deep and RIII borehole which is 101.8 meters. The water is heavily mineralized and lukewarm with an average temperature of 22.5\u00b0C. The mineral water used for spa treatments including rehabilitative care in oncology diseases, circulatory system diseases, disorders of metabolism and endocrine glands. "}

The Boeing 737 Classic series is made up of the Boeing 737-300, -400 and -500. These planes were not called the 737 Classics until the Boeing 737 Next Generation family was made. Before the 737 Next Generation family, the 737 Classics were called the 'new generation'. The 737 Classics were made from 1984 to 2000. 1,988 aircraft were made.\nDevelopment and design.\nAfter the Boeing 737-200 Advanced was made, Boeing wanted to make the 737 carry more passengers and fly further. Boeing began designing the 737 Classics in 1979. In 1980, information about the 737 Classic series was given at the Farnborough Airshow.\nThe 737 Classics had CFM56 turbofan engines. These engines were a very big improvement. They burned less fuel and made less noise. However, when the 737 is on the ground, the bottom of the plane is quite close to the ground. This meant that if the engines were not changed, they would be too close to the ground. Boeing and CFMI solved this by putting the engine in front of the wing, instead of below it. They also moved some parts of the engine to the side of the engine, instead of the bottom. These changes mean that the front of the 737 engines are not circles.\nThe wing had many changes made to it. The tip of the wing was made longer by . The flaps were also changed. The cockpit was made more modern and the passenger cabin had improvements made. The improvements were similar to improvements made to the Boeing 757.\nTypes of 737 Classic.\n737-300.\nThe prototype of the 737-300 was finished on January 17, 1984. It made its first flight on 24 February 1984. The plane became allowed to fly on November 14, 1984. USAir got the first 737-300 on 28 November. The plane was very popular. Boeing got 252 orders for it in 1985. It got over 1000 in total. The 737-300 series was made until 1999. The last plane was delivered to Air New Zealand on 17 December 1999.\nIn December 2008, Southwest Airlines asked Boeing to fit the 737-300 with new technology to make it more similar to the 737-700.\n737-400.\nThe 737-400 was made to fill the gap in between the 737-300 and the 757-200. Its main rivals were the Airbus A320 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80. It was 10\u00a0ft (3.45 m) longer than the 737-300. It could carry 168 passengers. It had a bumper on the tail so that it would not touch the ground while it was taking off. The prototype was finished on January 26, 1988. It flew for the first time on 19 February 1988.\nThe 737-400 went into service on September 15, 1988. The first airline to use it was Piedmont Airlines.\nThe 737-400F was a type of 737-400 designed to carry cargo. It was not made by Boeing, though. Airlines turned 737-400s into cargo aircraft by themselves. Alaska Airlines was the first to change one of their 737-400s to a 737-400F. It could carry 10 pallets. Alaska Airlines also changed five more 737-400s to carry half passengers and half cargo. These 737-400 aircraft are now being used. The 737-400 has been replaced by the 737-800.\n737-500.\nThe 737-500 was supposed to be a replacement for the 737-200. It was only made because customers wanted it. The -500 is 1\u00a0ft 7 in (47\u00a0cm) longer than the 737-200. It can carry up to 132 passengers. Both modern and older cockpits could be installed on the 737-500. Using the CFM56-3 engine burned a lot less fuel than the engines used on the 737-200s.\nThe first airline to order the 737-500 was Southwest Airlines. The -500 flew for the first time on 30 June 1989. A prototype had to fly for 375 hours so that the 737-500 could be allowed to fly. On February 28, 1990, Southwest got the first plane. The 737-500 has been replaced with the 737-600.\nUsers of the 737 Classic.\nCivilian.\nBoeing stopped making the 737 Classic in 2000. 1,651 Boeing 737 Classic aircraft are in service. This includes 879 -300s, 419 -400s, and 353 -500s. This information is correct as of July 2010.\nMilitary.\nMany countries use the 737 Classic as a military plane. Some of these are:\nAccidents.\nThe Boeing 737 Classic has had 26 hull-loss accidents. A hull-loss accident is when the aircraft is damaged so much that it can no longer be used, or if the aircraft is completely destroyed. There has been 1,040 deaths as of January 2010. \nOn February 1, 1991 A US Air 737-300 Under flight 1493 was landing at LAX when it collided with a Sky west Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner on When the Sky west flight was told to taxi through a runway the US air flight was landing on Upon landing the US air Flight Crashed into the Sky west flight everyone on board the Sky west flight died In total 35 people died and 66 people survived with 23 people with injuries .\nFeatures.\nSources: Boeing"}

Known as \"The Master\", Hobbs is regarded by critics as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He is the leading run-scorer and century-maker in first-class cricket, with 61,760 runs and 199 centuries. A right-handed batsman and an occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, Hobbs also excelled as a fielder, particularly in the position of cover point.\nEarly life.\nBorn into poverty in 1882, Hobbs wished to pursue a career in cricket from an early age. His early batting was undistinguished but a sudden improvement in 1901 brought him to the attention of local teams. Following the death of his father, he successfully applied to join Surrey, with the support of England batsman Tom Hayward. His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey, he scored 88 on his first-class debut and a century in his next game.\nCareer.\nBy 1907\u201308 Hobbs was playing Test cricket for England. He scored 83 in his first Test, and his international career continued until 1930. After some mixed Test performances, Hobbs' success against South African googly bowlers meant that his place was secure, and in 1911\u201312, he scored three centuries in the series against Australia. Afterwards, he was regarded as the best batsman in the world until the mid-1920s.\nIn county cricket, Hobbs developed an attractive, attacking style of play where he scored quickly, and he was very successful in the years approaching the First World War. After the war, Hobbs was again successful against Australia, but his career was threatened by appendicitis which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season. When he returned, he was more cautious as a batsmen and concentrated on safer, more defensive play. Yet he continued to be successful in Test and domestic cricket. He retired from Tests in 1930 but continued to play for Surrey until 1934.\nHobbs had a batting technique which critics regarded as ideal. His success was based on fast footwork, an ability to play many different shots, and excellent placement of the ball. His technical ability allowed him to prosper at a relatively late age for a cricketer. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting.\nAn opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey, and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe was the most effective in Test history.p215 Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.p127\nIn 1953, Hobbs was knighted, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured. Hobbs was reluctant to accept and only did so when convinced that it was an honour to all professional cricketers, not just himself.p377"}
