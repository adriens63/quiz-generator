This story was very popular during the Alexandrian period. What he says about the religions of the Indians is important. He mentions the devotees of Heracles (Lord Krishna) and Dionysus (Lord Shiva or King Lord Indra). However, he does not mention Buddhists.

At the time it was called First AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It was played on January 15, 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs. The score was 35\u201310.\nSuper Bowl I was the only Super Bowl in history that was not a sellout in terms of attendance. Of the 94,000 seat capacity in the Coliseum, 33,000 went unsold.\nThe game was broadcast on NBC and CBS. It is the only Super Bowl to be on two television networks. Each network used its own announcers. Ray Scott, Jack Whitaker, and Frank Gifford were on CBS. Curt Gowdy and Paul Christman were on NBC.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nThe Chiefs entered the game after an 11-2-1 during the regular season. In the AFL Championship Game, they beat the Buffalo Bills, 31-7.\nKansas City's offense led the AFL in points scored (448) and total rushing yards (2,274). Their trio of running backs, Mike Garrett (801 yards), Bert Coan (521 yards), and Curtis McClinton (540 yards) all ranked among the top ten rushers in the AFL. Quarterback Len Dawson was the top rated passer in the AFL. He completed 159 out of 284 (56 percent) of his passes for 2,527 yards and 26 touchdowns. Wide receiver Otis Taylor had 58 receptions of 1,297 yards and 8touchdowns. Receiver Chris Burford added 58 receptions for 758 yards and 8 touchdowns.\nThe Chiefs also had a strong defense. All-AFL players Jerry Mays and Buck Buchanan were on their line. Linebacker Bobby Bell was great at run stopping and pass coverage. The strongest part of their defense was their secondary, led by All-AFL safeties Johnny Robinson and Bobby Hunt, who each recorded 10 interceptions, and defensive back Fred Williamson, who recorded 4. Their Head Coach was Hank Stram.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nThe Packers were an NFL dynasty. They turned around what had been a losing team just eight years earlier. The team posted an NFL-worst 1\u201310\u20131 record in 1958. Then legendary head coach Vince Lombardi was hired in January 1959. Lombardi wanted to build a winning team. During the offseason, he signed Fred \"Fuzzy\" Thurston. Lombardi also made a big trade with the Cleveland Browns that brought three players to the team. These players became an important part of the defense: linemen Henry Jordan, Willie Davis, and Bill Quinlan.\nLombardi's hard work paid off. The Packers improved to a 7\u20135 regular season record in 1959. They surprised the league during the following year by making it all the way to the 1960 NFL Championship Game. The Packers lost 17\u201313 to the Philadelphia Eagles. But they showed that they were no longer losers. Green Bay went on to win NFL Championships in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, and 1967.\nPackers quarterback Bart Starr was the top-rated quarterback in the NFL for 1966. He won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award, completing 156 out of 251 (62.2 percent) passes for 2,257 yards, 14 touchdowns, and only 3 interceptions. His top targets were wide receivers Boyd Dowler and Carroll Dale. They combined for 63 receptions for 1,336 yards. Fullback Jim Taylor was the team's top rusher with 705 yards, and also caught 41 passes for 331 yards. The Packers offensive line was also big reason for the team's success. They were led by All-Pro guards Jerry Kramer and Thurston, along with Forrest Gregg.\nCeremonies and entertainment.\nThe first Super Bowl halftime show had American trumpeter Al Hirt, and the marching bands from the University of Arizona and Grambling State University.\nThe postgame, trophy presentation ceremony was handled by CBS' Pat Summerall and NBC's George Ratterman. Summerall and Ratterman had to share a single microphone."}

Canyons, ravines, gullies and other such geological forms are common in badlands. They are very difficult to cross by foot, or even on horse, and impossible by car. Dry badlands may have spectacular colour displays that range from dark black/blue coal strata to bright clays and sandstone.\nFeatures.\nThe term 'badlands' is apt: badlands have steep slopes, loose dry soil, slick clay, and deep sand, all of which act against travel and other uses. They form in dry regions with infrequent but intense rain-showers, little vegetation, and soft sediments which get massive erosion.\nSome of the most famous fossil beds are found in badlands, where erosion rapidly exposes the sedimentary layers and the scant cover of vegetation makes surveying and fossil hunting relatively easy.\nCoal seams get exposed in some badlands, so some coal mining districts have developed in badlands areas. An example of this is the Drumheller district of the Red Deer River in Alberta, where the Atlas Coal Mine historical site shows the last of 139 mines which operated in the badlands.\nLocations.\nSome of the best-known badland formations can be found in North America. In the U.S., Makoshika State Park in Montana, Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota and Badlands National Park in South Dakota together form a series of extensive badland formations. Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah are also badlands settings.\nThe Big Muddy Badlands in Saskatchewan, Canada, gained notoriety as a hideout for outlaws. There is a large badland area in Alberta, Canada, particularly in the valley of the Red Deer River (where Dinosaur Provincial Park is) and in Drumheller, Alberta where the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology is.\nA well-known badlands formation in New Zealand is the Putangirua Pinnacles \u2013 formed by the erosion of the conglomerate of an old river delta. It is at the head of a small valley near the southern tip of the North Island."}

The black-billed magpie lives in North America west of the Appalaches and north of the big Deserts. It can be found in temperate, open landscape. It is an omnivorous species: Insects, carrion and seeds are its main food, but it also takes small vertebrates and eggs. The breeding season of the black-billed magpie starts in May and it takes until the end of June for all chicks to fledge. The birds breed in solitary pairs that stay together for life.\nIn the genus \"Pica\", the species is closest to the North American yellow-billed magpie (\"P. nuttalli\"). Both species share a common ancestor that migrated from Kamtchatka to Alaska some time in the Pleistocene. Black-billed and yellow-billed magpie diverged as a result of the glaciation of the Rocky Mountains. The yellow-billed magpie became isolated in the warm climate of California and adapted to it.

The popularity of the spa declined after about 1725, but by then numerous large houses had been built by wealthy people who appreciated the nearness to London. Assembly rooms were built and still stand as the Assembly Rooms public house. Some remains of this are its water pump, wells and exhibits in the town's museum.

It was designed in 1925-1929 by the Scottish city planner Sir Patrick Geddes. This program designed the center of Tel Aviv and the area now known as \"Old North\".\nIn 1925 Patrick Geddes was commissioned to design a master plan for the city of Tel Aviv. The plan he produced was accepted in 1929. Tel Aviv turned out to be the only example of one of Geddes\u2019 plans being built largely as he envisaged and is a good example of an early planned city. The area of Tel Aviv originally planned by Geddes makes up approximately 7.5% of the current day municipality of Tel Aviv and is now known as Tel Aviv\u2019s \u201cOld North\u201d. It was designed to be an extension of the much older neighboring Arabic port town Jaffa to the south and a home for the increasing population of Jews emigrating from other parts of the world (predominantly Eastern Europe).\nFeatures and principles of Geddes Plan.\nGeddes, originally a biologist and sociologist were engaged to design a plan for the new city of Tel Aviv to be built adjacent to the ancient port town of Jaffa. The principles he employed for the city were strikingly similar to what we now know as New Urbanism ideas of planning - an emphasis was placed on pedestrians as opposed to motor car traffic, a sense of community and civic life was encouraged through the use of town squares and abundant planting of greenery provided significant focus on a minimal environmental footprint. Private automobile traffic was minimized and the city was envisaged on a pedestrian scale. This neighborhood identity has been crucial in the success of Tel Aviv as a city.\nAnother important aspect of Geddes's plan was the use of the \u201csuperblock,\u201d which was popular in the early to mid 20th century with its origins in the modernist movement. The main principles were to create extra-large blocks bounded by major rather than minor roads and have them threaded with narrow one-way streets designed in such a way to discourage traffic. The aim of these superblocks was to foster community and a sense of civic life within them. In order to achieve this, it was planned that at the center of each block was meant to be a central public space (a garden or public building). In reality, the commercial factors resulted in few of these central squares being captured for public use.\nGardens.\nGeddes took part of his inspiration from the Garden City movement developed by Ebenezer Howard, he was keen to ensure that greenery was an integral part of the Tel Aviv landscape. To this end, under his plan buildings were restricted to taking up a maximum of only one-third of any given site, these restrictions aimed to ensure maximum potential for neighborhoods well endowed with lush greenery.\nArchitecture.\nGeddes did not prescribe a certain architectural style for the area, traditionally a city planned along the lines of the British Garden City Movement would aim for an architectural style based on the traditional style for the region. Geddes recognized that the majority of the population he was designed for would-be immigrants from Europe and other parts of the world. He encouraged the development of a distinctly \u2018Jewish style\u2019. Interestingly Geddes provides little more than this style recommendation in his planning report.\nDeterioration and Development.\nOver the following decades after Geddes's plan was realized the area began to decay and there was significant public lament and dissatisfaction with the decay of the city. This deterioration was later used as justification for the rapid redevelopment of the area in the 1950s. However, it was noted that this disapproval of the decay of the city quickly changed to nostalgia when old buildings began being razed to make way for new development. Resultantly significant effort was made to preserve the historical neighborhoods planned by Geddes and in 1984 the Council for the Preservation of buildings and Sites was established to protect them.\nCriticism.\nCritics of Tel Aviv\u2019s layout have suggested it is not a beautiful city in the classic sense. A low standard of construction and of housing units (apartment buildings) has largely been blamed for this, citing that the buildings developed were ugly and akin to stacks of packing cases with shoeboxes for balconies.\nFurther criticism has been put that the city has not coped well with the increasing population and private car traffic not envisaged by Geddes at the time. Poor building construction and lack of proper maintenances have served as further critiques of the early city planning.\nNotwithstanding these criticisms of Geddes's planning of Tel Aviv, while not immune to the modern problems of traffic and development that all cities today face, Tel Aviv is widely regarded as a successful city and symbol of modern-day Israel."}

It is a method of dating which uses the patterns of growth rings in trees. In many types of wood, the time rings were formed can be dated to the exact calendar year. \nDendrochronology has three main uses: \nIn some parts of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands. The maximum for \"fully anchored chronologies\" is a little over 11,000 years from present. The term \"fully anchored chronology\" means the dates are absolutely certain.\nHistory.\nDendrochronology (word derived from Greek , \"dendron\", \"tree limb\"; , \"khronos\", \"time\"; and , \"-logia\") was developed during the first half of the 20th century originally by the astronomer A.E. Douglass, who founded the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Douglass researched sunspot activity. He expected changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on Earth. The climate would be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns.\nThe phenomenon of tree rings and their relationship with wet and dry years had been noticed before Douglass. There is a brief note in one of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Charles Babbage in 1837 came up with the same idea.\nHow it works.\nMany trees in temperate zones make one growth ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Through a tree's life, a year-by-year ring pattern is formed which reflects the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring. A drought year may result in a very narrow one. \nAlternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. Problems like this are fixed by comparing one part of the world with another. Missing rings are rare in oak and elm trees: the only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the Year without a Summer. \nTrees from the same region will tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period. These patterns can be compared and matched ring for ring with trees growing in the same geographical zone and under similar climatic conditions. Following these tree-ring patterns from living trees back through time, chronologies can be built up, both for entire regions, and for sub-regions of the world. Thus wood from ancient structures can be matched to known chronologies (a technique called cross-dating) and the age of the wood determined precisely. \nThe tree-ring dates can be extended back to 26,000 BP by using other methods. Those other methods use marine sediment layers and growth rings in corals."}

NK cells provide a rapid response to cells infected by viruses, or to bacterial cells. The response happens about 3 days after infection. NK cells also respond to tumour formation. \nNK cells are unique: they have the ability to recognise stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This allows for a much faster immune reaction.\nIn early experiments in cancer patients and animals, investigators found what was called a \"natural\" reactivity. That is, a certain population of cells seemed to be able to kill tumour cells without previously being sensitized to them. At first many thought that these observations were artifacts. However, by 1973, 'natural killing' activity was established across a wide variety of species, and the existence of a separate line of cells with this ability was suggested.\nFunction.\nTo control their cytotoxic activity, NK cells have two types of surface receptors: activating receptors and inhibitory receptors. When the NK cell is activated, it destroys the cells which have switched it on. \nSmall granules in their cytoplasm contain proteins and enzymes called granzymes. They are released close to a cell which has triggered their action. A protein \"perforin\" forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell, creating a channel through which enzymes and other molecules can enter. This kills the target cell. The details vary according to whether the target is a virus, a bacterium or a tumour cell.\nHypothesis.\nClass I MHC i can serve as an inhibitory ligand for\u00a0natural killer cells\u00a0(NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and certain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing.These inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I molecules, which could explain why NK cells kill cells with low levels of MHC class I molecules. This inhibition is crucial to the role played by NK cells. MHC class I molecules are main way cells display viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T-cells. A common evolutionary adaptation to this seen in both intracellular microbes and tumours is a long-term down-regulation of these MHC I molecules. This makes the cells impervious to T-cell action. NK cells may have evolved as an evolutionary response: the loss of MHC would deprive these cells of the inhibitory effect of MHC and make them vulnerable to NK cell attack.\nNK cell function in adaptive response.\nThe \"adaptive\" immune response generates memory cells after a primary infection. Then there is a rapid response to later infections by the same antigen. Earlier it was thought that NK cells play no role in the adaptive immune responses, but now it seems they do."}

In August, German general Lothar von Trotha defeated the Herero in the Battle of Waterberg and drove them into the desert of Omaheke, where most of them died of thirst. In October, the Nama people also fought against the Germans only to suffer a similar fate.\nIn total, from 24,000 up to 100,000 Herero and 10,000 Nama died. The genocide was marked by many deaths by starvation and thirst because the Herero who fled the violence were not allowed to go back to the Namib Desert. Some sources also claim that the German colonial army normally poisoned desert wells.\nIn 1985, the United Nations' Whitaker Report said that the aftermath was an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South West Africa, and said it was one of the first tries at genocide in the 20th century.

There, three separate horizons of glacial deposits are separated by non-glacial sediment.\nThis was one of the most severe and longest ice ages in geologic history. It was similar to the Snowball Earth ice ages that happened later, in the Neoproterozoic era. \nThe glaciations were probably triggered by the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), which removed atmospheric methane (a greenhouse gas), and eventually supplied free oxygen to the atmosphere. The alternate warm and ice age periods was probably caused by a repeating cycle. Cyanobacteria flourished in the warm periods, producing huge amounts of oxygen. The oxygen removed the free methane, and used up carbon dioxide. This caused the temperature to crash. This slowed down the bacteria. So the temperature rose again.\nHowever, it is also possible that there was a 250 million year lull in volcanic activity, resulting in lower carbon dioxide levels and so reduced greenhouse effect."}

{"id": "364021", "revid": "1109982", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=364021", "title": "Scalloped hammerhead", "text": "The scalloped hammerhead (\"Sphyrna lewini\"), also known as the bronze hammerhead, the kidney-headed hammerhead, or the southern hammerhead, is a species of hammerhead shark. It was first known as \"zygaena lewini\", but is now known as \"Sphyrna lewini\". The word \"Sphyrna\" is a Greek word meaning \"hammer\", which refers to the \"hammer\" or \"cephalofoil\" on its head.\nIt is . It is found in warm temperate and tropical coastal waters all around the world, between latitudes 46\u00b0 N and 36\u00b0 S. It is the most common Hammerhead shark.\nDescription.\nLike all other hammerhead sharks, the scalloped hammerhead has a \"hammer\", which is known as the \"cephalofoil\", on its head. The shark's eyes and nostrils are placed on the ends of the cephalofoil. Scalloped hammerheads usually grow to the length of 1.5 to 2.7 meters long, but the longest found was 4.3 meters long. The heaviest ever found weighed 150 kilograms. They are usually olive, bronze, light brown, grey-brown or even silver-grey in colour with a white belly. The edges of the fins are usually darker on the young, but as they grow older they become more lighter.\nTaxonomy.\nThe scalloped hammerhead was first known as \"Zygaena lewini\". It was renamed \"Sphyrna lewini\" in 1834. It has also been known as \"Cestracion leeuwenii\" in 1865, \"Zygaena erythraea\" in 1871, \"Cestracion oceanica\" in 1913, and \"Sphyrna diplana\" in 1941. The word \"Sphyrna\" is a Greek word meaning \"hammer\". It refers to the shape of the shark's head.\nWhere they live.\nThe scalloped hammerhead is a coastal pelagic species. It is found in continental and insular shelves, and in nearby deeper water. It is found in warm temperate and tropical coastal waters all around the world, between latitudes 46\u00b0 north and 36\u00b0 south. It can be found down to depths of over 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft) but is mostly found above 25 metres (82\u00a0ft).\nBehaviour.\nDuring the daytime, they are usually found close to shore. At night, they hunt further from the shore. Adults are usually found alone, in pairs or in small groups, The young are found in larger groups of up to one hundred or even more members. Although scalloped hammerheads are said to be harmless towards humans, there has been reports of attacks from this shark. These attacks could be caused from the great hammerhead shark.\nFeeding.\nScalloped hammerheads feed on fish such as sardines, mackerel, and herring. They sometimes eat cephalopods like octopuses and squids. They have also been known to eat other smaller species of sharks like the Blacktip reef shark, \"Carcharhinus melanopterus\", and the Atlantic sharpnose shark, \"(Rhizoprionodon terraenovae)\".\nReproduction.\nScalloped hammerheads are viviparous. Females are pregnant for 9 to 10 months before giving birth to 15 to 30 pups. Young ones grow slowly compared to other sharks. They also have darker fins than adults.\nEndangered status.\nIn 2008, the scalloped hammerhead was placed on the \"globally endangered\" list. Research has shown that in some parts of the Atlantic Ocean, populations have decreased by 95% in the last 30 years. The reason for this is because of over-fishing for shark fins. Their fins are made into shark fin soup. Researchers are calling for a ban on Shark finning, which is when the fin's of sharks are cut off and the rest of the animal is thrown back into the water to die. Hammerhead sharks are the most commonly caught sharks for finning."}

Born Hyder Naik, he distinguished himself militarily, eventually drawing the attention of Mysore's rulers. Rising to the post of \"dalwai\", or commander-in-chief to Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, he came to dominate the titular monarch and the Mysore government, and eventually seized control of all of the reins of power. He expanded the kingdom's borders at the expense of the Maratha Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad (among others), and was one of the few local rulers to effectively blunt the military advances of the British East India Company during two wars. In the First and Second Anglo-Mysore Wars he came within striking distance of the British outpost at Madras. He was given a number of honorific titles, and was referred to as Sultan Hyder Ali Khan or Hyder Ali Sahib.\nHyder's rule of Mysore was characterised by frequent warfare with his neighbours and rebellion within his territories. This was not unusual for the time, as much of the Indian subcontinent was then in turmoil, with the Hindu Maratha Confederacy struggling with the remnants of the Muslim Mughal Empire. He was a shrewd leader, and left his son Tipu Sultan a kingdom that was significantly larger than when he first took it over. He organised his military in part along European lines, and was a pioneer in the military use of rocket artillery. He had at least two wives, and fathered at least three children."}

It was designed by clergyman's daughter and children's author Anne Abbott. The game was published by W. &amp; S. B. Ives in 1843. Parker Brothers republished the game in 1894. The firm claimed the game was the first board game published in America, but this claim is disputed. It was however the first mass-produced board game in America.\nThe game is didacticit is both entertaining and instructive. The theme of the game is Christian virtue. Players race about a track of 66 spaces. \"The Mansion of Happiness\" (Heaven, the center space) is their goal. Landing on a space marked with a vice (such as dishonesty) will send the player back several spaces and away from the goal. Spaces marked with virtues (such as honesty) send players forward and closer to the goal. The winner is the player who reaches the center space first.\nLike many Christian-themed games of the middle 19th-century, \"The Mansion of Happiness\" lost some of its popularity in the last decades of the 19th century. It was then that games with secular and materialistic themes such as Milton Bradley's \"The Checkered Game of Life\" rose in demand. In literature, \"The Mansion of Happiness\" is mentioned in the boys' book \"Shifting for Himself; or, Gilbert Greyson's Fortunes\" (1876) by Horatio Alger, Jr. In this story, the title hero plays the game with friends Laura and Fred Vivian to while away the evening hours. In 2012 the game board was available on-line in a color reprint of the original. "}

{"id": "364112", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=364112", "title": "Smalleye hammerhead", "text": "The smalleye hammerhead (\"Sphyrna tudes\"), also known as the \"golden hammerhead\" or the \"curry shark\", is a small species in the hammerhead shark group, and is found in the shallow coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Venezuela to Uruguay. It likes to live in muddy habitats. Like all other hammerhead sharks, the smalleye hammerhead shark has a \"hammer\" (also known as the \"cephalofoil\") on its head.\nDescription.\nThe smalleye hammerhead shark is a small member of the hammerhead shark group, reaching up to the length of 1.5 meters (4.9\u00a0ft) long, but ones which are 1.2-1.3 meters (3.9-4.3\u00a0ft) long are more common. They weigh around 9\u00a0kg. The cephalofoil is wide and long, measuring up to 28-32% of the body length. The eyes, which are placed at the ends of the cephalofoil, are smaller than the eyes of other hammerhead sharks and have a third eyelid. The nostrils are placed inside the eyes.\nYoung smalleye hammerhead sharks are grey on the top and are white below. When they reach the length of 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in) their undersides start turning yellow, which turns to orange when they are 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) long. The golden colour then comes when they are 55\u201370\u00a0cm (22\u201328\u00a0in) long, but fades when they become mature.\nWhere they live.\nThe smalleye hammerhead shark is found along the eastern coast of South America, from Uruguay to Venezuela, but it is sometimes found further west than the Orinoco Delta southeast of Trinidad. They have been unconfirmed reports of this shark being found off Panama, Mexico, and western Florida. It is the most common shark of where it lives. The smalleye hammerhead shark also is found in inshore murky waters which are 5\u201340 meters (16\u2013130\u00a0ft) deep. Newborns and young ones which are under 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) long, are found in the shallowest waters, and move deeper as they grow older. Adult females are mostly found in water which is 9\u201318 meters (30\u201359\u00a0ft) deep, while adult males are mostly found at the depths of 27\u201336 meters (89\u2013118\u00a0ft).\nBehaviour.\nThere are four other species of hammerhead sharks which live in the same area as the smalleye hammerhead shark lives: the scoophead, the bonnethead, the great hammerhead shark and the scalloped hammerhead shark. There is little competition between these sharks because of their different habitats and eating. Adult males and young ones of both genders come together and form groups, although these groups to not seem to be made for reproduction or migration. Adult females seem to live alone.\nYoung smalleye hammerhead sharks which are under the length of 67\u00a0cm (26 inches) feed mostly on penaeid shrimp, while larger ones feed mainly on bony fish, especially ariid sea catfish and their eggs. The shrimp and the surface mucus layer and eggs of the catfish contain carotenoid pigments which seem to cause the golden colour of the shark. Another shark which lives in the same area as the smalleye hammerhead shark, the Yellow smooth-hound (\"Mustelus higmani\"), also feeds on shrimp and has a yellowish colour on it, but it is not as bright as the colour on the smalleye hammerhead shark. The smalleye hammerhead shark is also known to eat swimming crabs, squid, and newborn scalloped hammerhead sharks.\nThe smalleye hammerhead shark has been known to be eaten by larger sharks such as the bull shark (\"Carcharhinus leucas\"), and sometimes it has been eaten by bony fishes.\nReproduction.\nLike most other hammerhead sharks, the smalleye hammerhead shark is viviparous, meaning that it gives live birth. They mate in August and September and females are pregnant for around 10 months before giving birth to 5-12 pups in May and June. Males and females mature when they are 80 to 98\u00a0cm (31 to 39 inches) long. But male smalleye hammerhead sharks found off the northern Brazilian state of Maranh\u00e3o mature when they are 92\u00a0cm (36\u00a0cm) long, while females mature when they are over 101\u00a0cm (40\u00a0in) long.\nHuman interactions.\nShy and harmless towards humans, smalleye hammerhead sharks are fished throughout its range and is sold as food. Overfishing has now caused populations of the smalleye hammerhead shark to decrease. This has led the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to list it under Vulnerable."}

It holds a collection of portraits of historically important and famous British people. It was the first portrait gallery in the world when it opened in 1856. \nThe gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St Martin's Place, off Trafalgar Square, next to the National Gallery. It has been expanded twice since then. The National Portrait Gallery also has three regional outposts. It is not connected to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. The NPG is a quango sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\nThe collection.\nThe gallery houses portraits of historically important and famous British people, selected on the basis of the significance of the sitter, not that of the artist. The collection includes photographs and caricatures as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture. \nOne of its best-known images is the 'Chandos portrait', the most famous portrait of William Shakespeare although there is some uncertainty about whether the painting actually is of the playwright.\nNot all of the portraits are exceptional artistically, although there are self-portraits by William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds and other British artists of note. Some, such as the group portrait of the participants in the Somerset House Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the portrait of Edward VI by William Scrots, Patrick Bront\u00eb's painting of his sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne, or a sculpture of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969. \nIn addition to its permanent galleries of historical portraits, the National Portrait Gallery exhibits a rapidly changing collection of contemporary work, stages exhibitions of portrait art by individual artists and hosts the annual BP Portrait Prize competition.\nThe Gallery has many portrait busts by sculptors. The sculptors are mostly British or resident in Britain, and the subjects are British. Sculptors include poineers of modern sculpture such as Sir Jacob Epstein (14 examples), Dame Elizabeth Frink (5 examples), Sir Eduardo Paolozzi (four self-portrait busts)."}

His family is of French and Scottish heritage. In 1853 he went to Jefferson Medical college in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1855. He finished his studies in Havana and in Paris. Later he moved to Havana and started a medical practice.\nProfessional career.\nFinlay continued his work in the 1870s. He was the first to come up with the idea that a mosquito was a carrier for a disease that causes yellow fever. He discovered that the spread and cause of yellow fever was from a mosquito. The mosquito would bite a person with the disease and would then bite and infect a healthy person. A year later Finlay identified the mosquito of the genus Aedes as the insect transmitting yellow fever. His research led to the control of the mosquito population as a way to control the spread of the disease.\nDr. Finlay was a member of Havana's Royal Academy of Medical, Physical and Natural Sciences. He was fluent in French, German, Spanish, and English, and could read Latin. He was interested in a lot of things but his main interest was yellow fever. He wrote 40 articles on this disease.

Al-Fatiha has 14 chapters in the United States, as well as offices in England, Canada, Spain, Turkey, and South Africa.\nThe name means \"the Opening\" and is shared with Al-Fatiha or the first surah of the Qur'an. In the beginning of that surah, Allah is described as compassionate and merciful; the organization's founders believe that these attributes characterize Islam, rather than hatred and homophobia.\nEach year, Al-Fatiha hosts an international membership retreat and conference. Early conferences took place in Boston, New York, and London in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and focused on issues such as the reconciliation of religion and sexual orientation."}

It is widely and successfully used for electricity transmission and distribution. It is lighter and stronger than copper wire, which helps prevent the cables from sagging. It is also less expensive than copper wire. It has also been successfully used in aircraft wiring. In the 1960s, with the rising price of copper, electricians started to use it to wire homes and other buildings. Aluminum wiring was not successful in this application and it is a major safety problem. Because of the safety problems with aluminum wiring, it was discontinued for building wiring in the mid-1970s. Over time, aluminum wiring can separate from the screws on electrical outlets, switches, or lights, creating a poor connection, which causes the wire to heat up. The heat can cause the aluminum to oxidize, creating an even worse connection and more heat, which can eventually start a fire. Incorrect repairs to aluminum wiring, such as connecting aluminum wire to copper wire with twist-on wire connectors, can make the problem even worse. Even twist-on connectors designed to connect aluminum to copper can be dangerous. The only proper way to repair aluminum wiring is to connect it to copper \"tails\" (short pieces of copper wire) with crimped or screw-on connectors specifically designed for this purpose."}

For a short amount of time, it was also the national anthem of the Moldavian Democratic Republic from 1917 to 1918, and of the Moldavian Republic from 1991 to 1994. It has been the national anthem of present-day Romania since 1990.\nHistory.\nIt was originally a poem called Un r\u0103sunet ( \"An echo\") written by the Transylvanian poet named Andrei Mure\u0219anu during the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, and it was published in the same year in a Romanian magazine nameed \"Foaie pentru minte, inim\u0103 \u0219i literatur\u0103\". After hearing about the poem, a composer from Wallachia named Anton Pann made a melody for it. The author Andrei Mure\u0219anu later chose this music for his poem after he asked a church singer named Gheorghe Ucenescu to sing a melody that would fit for him many times.\nIt was sung for the first time in the city of Bra\u0219ov during the liberal and nationalist revolt, then right after it became the revolutionary anthem of Romania at the time.\nHistorical use.\nIn the past, it was the national anthem of the old and short-lived Republic of Moldova from 1991 to 1994 before being replaced with \"Limba noastr\u0103\". Between 1917 and 1918, \"De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!\" was used as the anthem of the short-lived Moldavian Democratic Republic before the region became part of the Kingdom of Romania.\nWhen communism no longer existed in Romania, the anthem \"Trei culori\" was replaced with \"De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!\" in 1990.\nFull lyrics.\nOnly the first, second, fourth, and eleventh stanzas (in bold) are sung.\nUnofficial verse translation.\nThe lyrics below are metered and rhyming in a poetic style.

Encouraged, Frobisher returned to Canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around Frobisher Bay. He carted 1,350 tons of the ore back, but after years of smelting, it was realised that both that batch of ore and the earlier one he had taken had been worthless iron pyrite.\nAs an English privateer/pirate, he collected riches from French ships.

J.\" Smith (27 January 1850 \u2013 15 April 1912) was an English sea captain. He was the captain of the R.M.S Titanic, which sank when it struck an iceberg. Smith was to retire after the maiden voyage of the Titanic, but he died when the ship sank.\nSmith was born on 27 January 1850 in Hanley, Staffordshire, England. He was married to Sarah Eleanor Pennington from 1887 until his death in 1912. They had one daughter.\nWhen the \"Titanic\" struck the iceberg, Smith knew within minutes that the ship was doomed and that people would die. During the evacuation, Captain Smith did all in his power to prevent panic and did his best to assist in the evacuation; Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club said \"He was doing everything in his power to get women in these boats, and to see that they were lowered properly. I thought he was doing his duty in regard to the lowering of the boats\". Robert Williams Daniel, a first class passenger also said:\nJust minutes before the ship started its final plunge, Smith was still busy releasing \"Titanic\"'s crew from their duties; he went to the Marconi operators room and released Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride and senior wireless operator John \"Jack\" Phillips from their duties. He then carried out a final tour of the deck, telling crew members: \"Now it's every man for himself.\" Steward Edward Brown saw the captain approach with a megaphone in his hand. He heard him say \"Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves.\u201d He saw the Captain walk onto the bridge alone just seconds before the ship took its final plunge. This was the last reliable sighting of Smith. Just seconds later Trimmer Samuel Hemming found the bridge apparently empty.\nSmith died that night along with around 1,500 others, and his body was never recovered.\nThere are conflicting accounts of his death; Some claimed to have seen Smith in the water swimming towards a lifeboat, or near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\", others claimed saw shooting himself with a pistol. Other accounts describe him entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed. The actual fate of captain Smith will probably remain uncertain. His body was never recovered.\nSmith has been played by many actors during documentaries, movies, television series, or plays. The most well known actors to play Smith are George C. Scott and Bernard Hill."}

People lived on the island from 1887 until 1974.\nIn 1890, Mitsubishi bought the inhabited island to mine coal from undersea tunnels. The company built Japan's first large concrete building. It was nine stories.\nThis Hashima Island is also known as \"The Prison island\" or \"The island of the Hell\", because many teenagers from South Korea forced to work at mines in Hashima Island. When those miners arrived there without knowing that they won't be able to see their homes again, majority of them were 13 years old to 15 years old. They had work under in such a terrible conditions: wearing only under wear to go in the mine also, they never got paid for their work and for their meals, they had to eat the left overs from making bean oil. Only two out of over a hundred of the young workers survived. They said \"I could here my friend yelling that they are hungry all the time.\" and \"I want to eat a bowl of rice grown in my country with a bowl of warm soup\". These survivors described Hashima Island as \"a prison that I am forced to stay without frames\" Also, Japan has rapidly said that the young miners volunteered to come so it is not considered as \"forced to work\". However, the two survivors does not agree with that. Behind the this island of Hashima there is sad truth.\nSince 2005, the island has been part of the city of Nagasaki.\nGeography.\nHashima island is near the mouth of Nagasaki harbour. It is about 19 miles from the center of the city.\nIn popular culture.\nThe island is one of the locations in the 2012 James Bond film \"Skyfall\"."}

Muir felt that the national parks and forests needed to be preserved and some resources which should be off-limits to industrial use. His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and many other wilderness areas throughout the United States. The Sierra Club, which he co-founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States.\nIn 1867, when he was 29, Muir was temporarily blinded in an accident in an Indianapolis sawmill, when his right cornea was pierced by a stray file.\nIn 1903, John Muir and the former U.S president Theodore Roosevelt went on a three-night camping trip. This trip later shaped the way president\u2019s thoughts and perceptions towards nature, and in turn, result in policies that were put in place in favour of the preservation of nature. One of such is the Yosemite Recession Bill in 1906, which put Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias under federal protection and by extension, part of Yosemite National Park. A total of five national parks, fifty-five national bird sanctuaries and wildlife refuges, 150 national forests were signed into existence throughout Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s presidency, indicative of how John\u2019s passion for nature rubbing off on the former president. \nOne of the most well-known hiking trails in the U.S., the John Muir Trail, was named in his honor.

It can also cause a fever. It is usually treated by taking antibiotic drugs."}

If there is not enough intrinsic factor, the small intestine is unable to get the vitamin B12.\nThere are several causes of pernicious anemia. These include a weakened stomach lining or a problem with the body's immune system, which causes it to attack the intrinsic factor. In some rare cases it can be passed down through families. Treatment is usually a regular injection of vitamin B12.\nIntrinsic factor was discovered by Thomas Addison."}

She and her best friend, a fish named Flounder, explore the ocean looking for human things. They talk to a seagull named Scuttle who explains each thing that they find (but not accurately). Ariel does not like living in the sea and wants to live on land, where people are. One day she sees a ship of people and meets a prince named Eric. She saves his life from drowning. When Ariel's father, King Triton, finds out that she saved a human man from drowning, he destroys all the things she has kept in her grotto. After that, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam tell her about a seawitch named Ursula. They tell her that Ursula can make her dreams come true. She follows them to Ursula's lair where she has magic potions. She uses her magic to turn Ariel into a human for exactly three days, in exchange for her voice. In order to stay human, she has to kiss Prince Eric, or else she will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Eric shows her his palace and helps her adapt. On the second day, Sebastian the crab gathers the other sea animals together and they sing \"Kiss the Girl\", hoping to make Eric kiss Ariel. The plan almost works, but Flotsam and Jetsam cause the boat to sink. Ursula decides that enough is enough and uses Ariel's voice to turn herself into a beautiful girl named Vanessa. She casts a hypnotic spell on Eric to make him forget about Ariel. The next day, everyone finds out that Eric is getting married, and Ariel is very sad. Scuttle finds out that the girl Eric is marrying is Ursula in disguise. He tells Ariel and manages to create disruption, delaying the wedding. The seashell Ursula is wearing breaks and Ariel's voice comes back. She tries to kiss Eric, but the sun sets and she turns back into a mermaid. Ursula offers to let Ariel go if Triton takes her place. He accepts it and turns into a plant. With help from Sebastian and Flounder, Prince Eric and Ariel defeat Ursula. Ursula dies and all the plants she had turn back into mermaids. Finally King Triton gives Ariel her wish and she is allowed to marry Prince Eric."}

{"id": "365381", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365381", "title": "Thutmose I", "text": "Thutmose I (also known as \"Thothmes,\" \"Thutmosis\" or \"Tuthmosis I\", meaning \"Thoth-Born\") was the third Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. He became pharaoh after the death of Amenhotep I. During his reign, he sent his armies into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt further than ever before. He built many temples in Egypt and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings. He is the first king known to have done this, though Amenhotep I may have done it first. He was succeeded by his son Thutmose II, and then his daughter, Hatshepsut. He ruled from 1506 to 1493 BC. Some scholars give his dates from 1526 BC to 1513 BC. This depends on where the astronomical observations used to calculate ancient Egyptian dates were made. If the observations were from the city of Memphis it would give the dates 20 years earlier than if it was Thebes.\nFamily.\nThutmose's father is unknown, but it may have been Amenhotep I. His mother, Senseneb, was not from a royal family and may have been a lesser wife or concubine of Amenhotep. Thutmoses's wife, Queen Ahmose, the Great Royal Wife, was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I. There is some doubt, as she was never called a \"king's daughter.\" Some historians believe that she was Thutmose's own sister. Thutmose's first son with Ahmose was Amenmose. He was born long before Thutmose's coronation. He can be seen on a stela from about 1522 BC hunting near Memphis. He became the commander of the army. Amenmose died about the same time as Thutmose. Thutmose had another son, Wadjmose, and two daughters, Hatshepsut and Nefrubity, by Ahmose. Wadjmose died before his father, and Nefrubity died as an infant. Thutmose had a son by another wife, Mutnofret. This son, married to Thutmose's daughter Hatshepsut, succeeded him as Thutmose II. Hatshepsut said that Thutmose gave the kingship to them both. However, this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut's supporters to support her claim to the throne when she later took over power.\nDates and length of reign.\nDuring the reign of Amenhotep I, the Egyptians recorded an astronomical event. This was the star Sothis appearing above the horizon at dawn. This is called a heliacal rising. Modern scientists believe that Sothis is the star that we call Sirius. If this observation was made at Thebes, it took place in 1517 BC. From this date, the date of Amenhotep's death, and Thutmose's coronation can be calculated to 1506 BC. But a few historians believe that the observations were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis. This would mean that Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC.\nAn Egyptian priest, Manetho, writing in the third century BC, said that Thutmose I's reign lasted 12 Years and 9 Months (or 13 Years). This data is supported by two dated inscriptions from Years 8 and 9 of his reign with Thutmoses's cartouche found on a stone block in Karnak. Accordingly, Thutmose is usually said to have ruled from 1506 BC to 1493 BC, but some scholars date him from 1526 BC to 1513 BC\nMilitary achievements.\nAt the time Thutmose became king, Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule. Thutmose travelled up the Nile with his army and fought in the battle, personally killing the Nubian king. He returned to Thebes with the Nubian king's body hung from the front of his ship. In the third year of his reign he led a another expedition against Nubia. He ordered the canal at the first cataract to be made deeper to make it easier to get his ships upstream. The canal had been first built by Sesostris III of the 12th Dynasty. This helped make Nubia part of the Egyptian empire. This expedition is mentioned in two separate inscriptions by the king's son Thure:\nIn the second year of Thutmose's reign, a stele at Tombos records that he built a fortress there. This is near the third cataract. Before this the Egyptian army had stopped at Buhen, at the second cataract. This stele says that he already fought in Syria. His Syrian campaign may be placed at the beginning of the second year of his rule. The Syrian campaign was the farthest north any Egyptian ruler had ever campaigned. Although it has not been found in modern times, he set up a stele when he crossed the Euphrates River. During this campaign, the Syrian princes declared loyalty to Thutmose. However, after he went back to Egypt, they stopped tribute and began building defences against future attacks. Thutmose celebrated his victories with an elephant hunt in the area of Niy, near Apamea in Syria. He returned to Egypt with strange tales of the Euphrates, \"that inverted water which flows upstream when it ought to be flowing downstream.\" The Euphrates was the first major river which the Egyptians had seen which flowed from the north. This would be downstream on the Nile, instead of the south which was upstream on the Nile. The river became known in Egypt as the \"inverted water.\"\nNubia rebelled against Egyptian rule again in his fourth year. He sent his army even farther south to stop it. An inscription from his reign has been found as far south as Kurgus, which was south of the fourth cataract. During his reign, he began a number of projects which effectively ended Nubian independence for the next 500 years. He enlarged a temple to Sesostris III and Khnum, opposite the Nile from Semna. There are also records of specific religious rites which the viceroy of El-Kab was to have performed in the temples in Nubia for the king. He also appointed a man, Turi, to the position of viceroy of Cush, also known as the \"King's Son of Cush.\" With a civilian representative of the king living in Nubia itself, Nubia did not dare to revolt as often as it had. It was easily controlled by future Egyptian kings.\nBuilding projects.\nThutmose I organized great building projects during his reign, including many temples and tombs. His greatest projects were at the Temple of Karnak under the supervision of the architect Ineni. Before this, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar boats along the side of the road. Thutmose had the temple made much bigger. He had a fifth pylon built along the temple's main road. He built a wall around the inner temple and two flagpoles on either side of the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosing wall. He built a hypostyle hall between pylons four and five. This was made with columns of cedar wood. This was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built very large statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he built four more flagpoles and two obelisks. One of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.\nThutmose I also built statues of the Ennead at Abydos, buildings at Armant, Ombos, el-Hiba, Memphis, and Edfu, as well as minor expansions to buildings in Nubia, at Semna, Buhen, Aniba, and Quban.\nDeath and burial.\nThutmose I was the first king who definitely was buried in the Valley of the Kings. The architect, Ineni, built the tomb, and his mortuary temple. This temple has not been found as it was probably destroyed by the building of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. \nThutmose I was buried in a tomb now called KV20 dug high into the cliffs of the Valley of the Kings. His daughter Hatshepsut had the tomb made bigger, with a room big enough for both of their stone coffins (sarcophagus). His grandson, Thutmose III had him reburied in KV38. KV20 was rediscovered during the Napoleonic expedition of 1799. In 1844, the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius had explored its upper passage. However, many passageways were blocked by rocks, stones and other rubbish brought in during floods. In 1903-1904 Howard Carter, after two years of hard work, was able to clear the passages and enter the double burial chamber. He found broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages. He found parts of two vases made for Queen Ahmose Nefertari, which were part of the original funerary equipment of Thutmose I. On one vase was written that Thutmose II \"[made it] as his monument to his father.\" Other vessels which had the names and titles of Thutmose I had also been inscribed by his son and successor, Thutmose II. There were parts of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king which had her royal name of 'Maatkare'.\nCarter, however, also discovered two separate coffins in the burial chamber. The beautifully carved sarcophagus of Hatshepsut \"was discovered open with no sign of a body, and with the lid lying discarded on the floor.\" It is now in the Cairo Museum with a matching yellow quartzite canopic chest. A second sarcophagus, was found lying on its side, with its almost undamaged lid propped against the wall. This was given to Theodore M. Davis, who had paid for the excavation. Davis gave it to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The sarcophagus had originally been engraved with the name of \"the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare Hatshepsut.\" However, when the sarcophagus was complete, Hatshepsut decided to have a new one made for herself. She used the first sarcophagus for her father, Thutmose I. The stonemasons then tried to erase the original carvings by restoring the surface of the quartzite so that it could be re-carved with the name and titles of Thuthmose I. The sarcophagus is seven feet long and three feet wide with walls five inches thick. It has text carved on it which records Hatshepsut's generosity towards her father:\nAfter Hatshepsut's death, Thutmose III, Hatshepsut's successor, moved his grandfather to a magnificent new tomb, KV38. This had another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I. It was covered with texts which spoke of this pharaoh's love for his dead grandfather. Thutmose I's remains were disturbed during the 20th dynasty when KV38 was robbed. The sarcophagus' lid was broken and all this king's valuable precious jewellery and grave goods were stolen. The original coffin of Thutmose I was taken over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. In 1994 a flood refilled KV20 with stones and debris.\nThutmose I's mummy has not yet been identified. He was reburied during 21st dynasty when the bodies of the pharaohs of the 18th and 19th dynasties were rewrapped and buried in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. They were discovered in 1881. The mummies included Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, believed that unlabelled mummy #5283 was that of Thutmose I. The face had the same features as the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III. Later research proved that it was an 18th dynasty mummy..\nGaston Maspero wrote:\nThis mummy can be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, in 2007, Dr. Zahi Hawass announced that the mummy is that of a 30 year old man who had died as a result of an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it could not be King Thutmose I."}

It formed by about 3,100 mya and broke up by 2,500 mya. The name \"Vaalbara\" comes from the South African Kaapvaal craton and the West Australian Pilbara craton. These cratons were combined in the Vaalbara supercontinent.\nSouth Africa's Kaapvaal craton and Western Australia's Pilbara craton are two of the best-preserved Archaean cratons on Earth. They have remarkably similar early Precambrian rocks. Identical radiometric ages of 3,470 \u00b12 mya have been got from rocky material thrown out by meteorite strikes. Similar structures from these two cratons have been dated between 3,500 to 2,700 mya. Similar greenstone belts are found at the edges of the Superior craton of Canada, and across the cratons of the former Gondwana and Laurasia continents.\nPalaeomagnetic data from rocks in the cratons showed that at 3,870 mya the two cratons could have been part of the same supercontinent. Both the Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons show extensional faults which were active about the same time during volcanism at the same time as the impact layers were formed.\nContinental plates have periodically collided and assembled in periods of orogeny (mountain building) to form supercontinents. The cycle of supercontinent formation, breakup, dispersal and reformation by plate tectonics occurs every 450 million years or so."}

In Niger, many of the people who practice traditional religions have mixed some beliefs from Islam into their religions. Because of this, it is hard to say exactly how many people practice each religion.\nIslam in Niger began to spread around a thousand years ago. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Islam became more common than Niger's traditional religions. Since then, Sufi brotherhoods have become the most common and powerful Muslim organisations, like in many West African countries. Because of this, there are many different interpretations (or ways of understanding and practicing) Islam in Niger. These different interpretations exist alongside each other, and alongside less common religions, usually peacefully.\nThe government of Niger is secular, or separate from any religion. At the same time, the government recognizes that Islam is the most popular religion in the country."}

It had most or all of Earth's landmass when the Neoproterozoic era began.\nRodinia existed between 1.1 billion and 750 million years ago. It formed from parts of an older and poorly understood supercontinent.\nRodinia broke up in the first period of the Neoproterozoic, the Tonian. Later its continental fragments were re-assembled to form Pangaea 300250 million years ago. In contrast with Pangaea, little is known yet about the exact position and history of Rodinia.\nThe extreme cooling of the global climate around 700 million years ago (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the following Ediacaran and Cambrian periods may have been caused by the breaking up of Rodinia.\nBreak-up.\nThe break-up of Rodinia is understood better than its formation. Extensive flood basalt flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents. This is evidence for large scale rifting about 750 million years ago. As early as 850 and 800 million years ago, a rift developed, eventually becoming an ocean in the Ediacaran.\nIn a separate rifting event about 610 million years ago (halfway in the Ediacaran period), the Iapetus Ocean formed. It might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 million years ago. This hypothetical supercontinent is called Pannotia.\nIts effect on life.\nUnlike later supercontinents, Rodinia itself was entirely barren. It existed before life colonized dry land. It was before the ozone layer formed, so Rodinia was too exposed to the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight for organisms to live there and leave fossils. However, its existence probably affected the marine life of its time.\nIn the Cryogenian period, the Earth experienced large glaciations, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial areas of Rodinia may have been covered by glaciers or the southern polar ice cap.\nThe eventual rifting of the continents created new oceans, and seafloor spreading, which produces warmer, less-dense oceanic lithosphere. Due to its lower density, hot oceanic lithosphere does not lie so deep as old, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the sea level to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas.\nThe increased evaporation from the larger water area of the oceans may have increased rainfall, which, in turn, increased the weathering of exposed rock. This increased rainfall may have reduced greenhouse gas levels. When CO2 level dropped, the period known as Snowball Earth began. Increased volcanic activity also introduced nutrients into the seas. This may have played an important role in the development of the earliest animals."}

He is best known for his pioneering research in nuclear transplantation, and cloning. \nNuclear transplantation means taking the nucleus out of cells in tissue culture and putting them into other cells whose nucleus has been removed. It is called somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this way, specialised cells can be \"reprogrammed\" to become like stem cells.\nHonours and awards.\nGurdon was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1971, and was knighted in 1995. In 2004, the Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Institute for Cell Biology and Cancer was renamed the Gurdon Institute in his honour. He has also received numerous awards, medals and honorary degrees. He has been awarded the 2009 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research award. \nNobel Prize.\nIn 2012 Gurdon was awarded, jointly with Shinya Yamanaka, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent\". \"Pluripotent\" cells are stem cells.\nResearch.\nNuclear transfer.\nIn 1958, Gurdon, then at the University of Oxford, successfully cloned a frog using intact nuclei from the somatic cells of a \"Xenopus\" tadpole. This was an important extension of work of Briggs and King in 1952 on transplanting nuclei from embryonic blastula cells.\nGurdon\u2019s experiments captured the attention of the scientific community and the tools and techniques he developed for nuclear transfer are still used today.\nAt that time he could not conclusively show that the transplanted nuclei derived from a fully differentiated cell. This was finally shown in 1975 by a group working at the Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland. They transplanted a nucleus from an antibody-producing lymphocyte (proof that it was fully differentiated) into an enucleated egg and got living tadpoles.\nGurdon\u2019s experiments captured the attention of the scientific community and the tools and techniques he developed for nuclear transfer are still used today. The term 'clone' (from the ancient Greek word \"\u03ba\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\" kl\u014dn = \u201ctwig\u201d) was already in use since the beginning of the 20th century in reference to plants. In 1963 the British biologist J.B.S. Haldane, in describing Gurdon\u2019s results, became one of the first to use the word \"clone\" in reference to animals.\nHe was awarded the Lasker Award in 2009 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012.\nMessenger RNA expression.\nGurdon and colleagues also pioneered the use of \"Xenopus\" eggs to translate microinjected messenger RNA molecules. This technique has been widely used to identify the proteins encoded, and to study their function.\nRecent research.\nGurdon's recent research has focused on analysing intercellular signalling factors involved in cell differentiation, and on elucidating the mechanisms involved in reprogramming the nucleus in transplantation experiments, including demethylation of the transplanted DNA."}

He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2012 with John Gurdon. He won the Wolf Prize in Medicine in 2011 with Rudolf Jaenisch; and the Millennium Technology Prize in 2012 together with Linus Torvalds.\nHe researches into adult stem cells. He is director of Center for iPS Cell Research and Application and a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University. He is also a senior investigator at the UCSF-affiliated J. David Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, California; and a professor of anatomy at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Yamanaka is also the current president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR).\nWhat he did.\nIn development, embryonic stem cells can turn into any tissue. Fibroblasts in the skin are one type of cell.\nIn 2006, Yamanaka and his team took adult mouse fibroblasts and turned them back into stem cells in tissue culture. The changed cells are known as 'induced pluripotent stem cells' (iPS cells). iPS cells are like embryonic stem cells from a blastocyst (the embryo a few days after fertilization).\nThe procedure used transfection of some stem cell-associated genes into the adult fibroblasts. The transfected genes include the master transcriptional regulators. Transfection is typically done with viral vectors, such as retroviruses.\nThe team could show that the iPS cells were pluripotent (capable of generating all cell lineages of the body). Soon they grew mice which included iPS cells. In 2007, he and his team generated iPS cells from \"human\" adult fibroblasts, again the first group to do so. The main medical application will be replacement of faulty or damaged tissues in humans. This is not available at present. An independent assessment of this field is available."}

From 1922 to 1927, Nansen was the League of Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nCareer.\nIn his youth a champion skier and ice skater, he led the team that made the first crossing of the Greenland interior in 1888, and won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86\u00b014\u2032 during his North Pole expedition of 1893\u201396. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. \nNansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University, and later worked as a curator at the Bergen Museum where his research on the central nervous system of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish modern theories of neurology. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; in the course of his research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment. As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Charles of Denmark to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.\nIn the final decade of his life Nansen devoted himself primarily to the League of Nations, following his appointment in 1921 as the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1922 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of the displaced victims of the First World War and related conflicts. Among the initiatives he introduced was the \"Nansen passport\" for stateless persons, a certificate recognised by more than 50 countries. \nDeath and honors.\nHe worked on behalf of refugees until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1930, after which the League established the Nansen International Office for Refugees to ensure that his work continued. This office received the Nobel Peace Prize for 1938. Nansen was honoured by many nations, and his name is commemorated in numerous geographical features, particularly in the polar regions."}

It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was first released in the United States on November 8, 1973.\nIt is the 21st Disney animated movie. It is based on the legend of Robin Hood, but uses anthropomorphic animals instead of people. The story follows the adventures of Robin Hood, Little John and the inhabitants of Nottingham as they fight against the excessive taxation of Prince John, and Robin Hood wins the hand of Maid Marian.\nPlot.\nThe movie is narrated by the rooster Alan-a-Dale. He explains that Robin Hood and Little John live in Sherwood Forest, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor townsfolk of Nottingham. The Sheriff of Nottingham and his posse often try to catch the two but fail every time. Meanwhile, Prince John and his assistant Sir Hiss, arrive in Nottingham. Sir Hiss hypnotized Prince John's brother King Richard to go off on the Crusades, allowing Prince John to take the throne. Unfortunately, the prince is greedy and immature, even sucking his thumb whenever his mother is mentioned. Robin and Little John rob Prince John by disguising themselves as fortune tellers. This results in the prince putting a bounty on their heads and making the Sheriff his personal tax collector.\nThe Sheriff taxes Friar Tuck and a family of rabbits. However, Robin gives back some money to the rabbits, giving his hat and archery kit to the young rabbit Skippy for his birthday. Skippy and his friends test out the archery kit, but Skippy fires an arrow into the grounds of Maid Marian's castle. The children sneak inside, meeting Maid Marian and her attendant Lady Kluck. Maid Marian reveals she and Robin were childhood sweethearts but they have not seen one another for years. Friar Tuck visits Robin and Little John, explaining that Prince John is hosting an archery tournament, and the winner will get a kiss from Maid Marian. Robin agrees to participate in the tournament disguised as a stork while Little John disguises himself as the Duke of Chutney to get near Prince John. Sir Hiss discovers Robin's identity but is trapped in a barrel of ale by Friar Tuck and Alan-a-Dale. Robin wins the tournament, but Prince John exposes him and has him arrested for execution despite Maid Marian's pleas.\nLittle John threatens Prince John leading to a fight between Robin, Little John, Maid Marian, Lady Kluck and Prince John's soldiers. In the forest, Robin and Maid Marian fall in love again as the townsfolk mock Prince John, describing him as the \"Phony King of England\". Angering by the insult, Prince John triples the taxes, imprisoning most of the townsfolk who cannot pay their taxes. The Sheriff visits Friar Tuck's church to steal from the poor box, angering Friar Tuck who is arrested too. Prince John plans to hang Friar Tuck to lure in Robin and kill him. Robin and Little John sneak in, with Little John managing to free all of the prisoners while Robin steals Prince John's taxes, but Sir Hiss awakens to find Robin fleeing.\nThe Sheriff corners Robin after he is forced to return to rescue a straggler, setting fire to Prince John's castle and causing Robin to leap from a tower into the moat below. Little John and Skippy watch as the moat is pelted with arrows and Robin is seemingly shot and drowned, but he emerges unharmed after using a reed as a breathing tube. Prince John is saddened and driven into a blind rage when Sir Hiss points out his mother's castle is on fire. Later, King Richard returns to England, placing his brother and his cohorts under arrest. He allows Robin and Maid Marian to be married and leave Nottingham with Little John and Skippy in tow.\nRelease.\nThe movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on November 9, 1973. The movie was re-released on March 26, 1982. It was released to videocassette on December 4, 1984. It thus became the first installment of the Walt Disney Classics home video label. Disney thought the idea of releasing any of its animated classics (known as the \"untouchables\") might threaten future theatrical release money. However, \"Robin Hood\" was viewed as the first choice because it was not held in such high regard as some of the other titles, and was less likely to get another theatrical release as its 1982 reissue proved to be disappointing. It was later re-released in 1991 (as part of Walt Disney Classics Collection 1994, and 1998 (as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection\nIn January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Gold Classic Collection, with \"Robin Hood\" re-released on VHS and DVD on July 4, 2000. The DVD had the movie in its 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and was accompanied with special features including a trivia game and the cartoon short \"Ye Olden Days\". The remastered \"Most Wanted Edition\" DVD (\"Special Edition\" in the UK) was released in 2006. It featured a deleted scene/alternate ending, as well as a 16:9 matted transfer to represent its original theatrical screen ratio. On August 6, 2013, the movie was released as the 40th Anniversary Edition on a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack."}

The third son of King Oscar I of Sweden and Josephine of Leuchtenberg, he was a descendant of Gustav I of Sweden through his mother.\nEarly life.\nWhen he was born on January 21, 1829 in Stockholm, Oscar Fredrik was created Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland. He entered the navy at the age of eleven, and was appointed junior lieutenant in July 1845. Later he studied at Uppsala University, where he distinguished himself in mathematics. On 13 December 1848, he was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nFrom 1859, when his father died, he was first in line to the Swedish throne after his oldest brother King Charles, who then had no male heirs (his son had died in infancy in 1854). His middle brother Gustaf had died in 1852.\nKing of Sweden and Norway.\nHe succeeded his brother Charles XV and IV on 18 September 1872, and was crowned as king of Norway in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 18 July 1873. At the accession he adopted as his motto \"Br\u00f6drafolkens v\u00e4l\" / \"Broderfolkenes Vel\" (\"The Welfare of the Brother Peoples\"). While the King and the Royal Court resided mostly in Sweden, Oscar made the effort of learning to be fluent in Norwegian and from the very beginning he realized the essential difficulties in the maintenance of the union between the two countries.\nLater life.\nThe political events which led up to the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 could hardly have been attained but for the tact and patience of the king himself. He was dethroned on 7 June 1905 by the Norwegian Parliament and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26 October. \nPersonal life.\nOn 6 June 1857 he married in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, Germany, Princess Sophia Wilhelmina, youngest daughter of Duke William of Nassau. \nDeath.\nHis health declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better relations between the two countries were restored before his death in Stockholm on 8 December 1907 from unknown causes."}

It is also useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. \nProperties.\nThe Gumbel distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Gumbel distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form. These distributions differ in their \"location\" and \"scale\" parameters: the mean (\"average\") of the distribution defines its location, and the standard deviation (\"variability\") defines the scale.\nOne recognizes the Gumbel \"probability density function\" (PDF) and the Gumbel \"cumulative distribution function\" (CDF).\nPDF.\nIn the PDF, the probability P of a value V to occur between limits A and B, briefly written as P(A&lt;VP(V \\leq A) = CDF(A) &lt;/math&gt;.\nMathematics.\nThe CDF.\nThe mathematical expression of the CDF is:\nwhere \u03bc is the \"mode\" (the value where the probability density function reaches its peak), \"e\" is a mathematical constant, about 2.718, and \u03b2 is a value related to the \"standard deviation\" (\u03c3) :\nwhere \u03c0 is the Greek symbol for Pi whose value is close to 22/7 or 3.142, and the symbol formula_3 stands for the square root.\nMode and median.\nThe \"mode\" \u03bc can be found from the \"median\" M, being the value of A where CDF(A)=0.5, and \u03b2:\nwhere \"ln\" is the natural logarithm.\nMean.\nThe \"mean\", E(x), given by:\nwhere formula_6 = \"Euler constant\" formula_7 0.5772.\nEstimation.\nIn a data series, the parameters \"mode\" (\u03bc) and \u03b2 can be estimated from the average, median and standard deviation. The calculation of the last three quantities is explained in the respective Wiki pages. Then, with the help of formulas given in the previous section, the factors \u03bc and \u03b2 can be calculated. In this way, the CDF of the Gumbel distribution belonging to the data can be determined and the probability of interesting data values can be found.\nApplication.\nIn hydrology, the Gumbel distribution is used to analyze such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes, and also to describe droughts.\nThe blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Gumbel distribution to ranked maximum one-day October rainfalls showing also the 90% \"confidence belt\" based on the binomial distribution.

Many people around the world have infections of \"M. tuberculosis\" without showing any signs of it.\nMycobacterial infections are difficult to treat. The organisms are tough due to their cell wall. In addition, they are naturally resistant to a number of antibiotics that disrupt cell-wall building, such as penicillin. With their unique cell wall, they can survive long exposure to acids, alkalis, detergents, oxidative bursts, lysis by complement, and many antibiotics. \nMost mycobacteria are susceptible to the antibiotics clarithromycin and rifamycin, but antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged.\nThe Greek prefix \"myco\" means \"fungus\". When they are cultured on the surface of liquids, mycobacteria growth is similar to that of moulds, a kind of fungus."}

He built some small monuments and began two small military campaigns but did little else during his rule and was probably strongly influenced by his wife, Hatshepsut. He ruled from 1493 BC to 1479 BC. Thutmose II's body was found in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut with many other pharaohs. It can be viewed today in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\nFamily.\nThutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and a minor wife, Mutnofret. He may married his fully royal half-sister, Hatshepsut, in order to secure his kingship. His armies stopped rebellions in Nubia and the Levant and defeated a group of nomadic Bedouins. But these campaigns were led by the king's Generals, and not by Thutmose II himself. This is often seen as evidence that Thutmose II was still a child at his when he became king. Thutmose II fathered Neferure with Hatshepsut, and a male heir, the famous Thutmose III, by a lesser wife named Iset before his death.\nSome archaeologists believe that Hatshepsut was the real power behind the throne during Thutmose II\u2019s rule. Domestic and foreign policies were similar and she claimed that her father wanted them to rule together. She is pictured in several scenes from a Karnak gateway dating to Thutmose II's reign, both together with her husband and alone. She later had herself crowned Pharaoh several years into the rule of her husband's young successor Thutmose III. \"The queen's agents actually replaced the boy king's name in a few places with her own cartouches\" on the gateway.\nThe ancient historian Manetho wrote that Thutmose II ruled for 13 years. This figure is highly disputed among scholars. Some modern historians believe he ruled for only three years.\nAchievements.\nMost pharaohs are remembered because of the number of monuments and buildings they created. However Hatsehput had his name removed replaced with her own. Thutmose III had Thutmose II's name added to all kinds of monuments. This makes it hard for people studying Thutmose II to know what he really created.\nThere are several surviving buildings built for the king at Semna, Kumma, and Elephantine. His biggest monument was a limestone gateway at Karnak that was once at the front of the Fourth Pylon's forecourt. But this monument was not completed in Thutmose II's reign but in the reign of his son Thutmose III. This suggests that Thutmose II did not rule for very long. The gateway was later pulled down and its building blocks used for the foundation of the Third Pylon by Amenhotep III.\nWhen Thutmose II became king, there was a rebellion by the Kush. The Egyptians retreated into the fort built by Thutmose I. Thutmose II was too young for battle, but he sent an army into Nubia. The rebellion was easily crushed with the help of his father's military generals. \nThutmose also seems to have fought against the Shasu Bedouin in the Sinai. This was a minor raid, but the army went as far as Upper Retenu, or Syria. This quite possibly indicates that the raid against the Shasu was only fought on the way to Syria.\nMummy.\nThutmose II's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri cache, in 1881. He was in a tomb with other 18th and 19th kings including Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX.\nThe mummy was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero on July 1, 1886. The face and shape of the head was very similar to the mummy of Thutmose I, his likely father. The body of Thutmose II been badly damaged by ancient tomb robbers. His left arm was broken off at the shoulder-joint, the forearm separated at the elbow joint, and his right arm chopped off below the elbow. His abdomen and much of his chest looked as if it had been hacked with an axe. His right leg had been cut from his body. All of these injuries had taken place after his death. The body also showed signs that Thutmose II did not have an easy life:"}

In the year 1890, Robert Koch developed tuberculin, as a treatment for tuberculosis. The substance proved ineffective to treat the disease, today it is commonly used to detect it, though. Tuberculin is a substance based on the pathogen that causes tuberculosis. Charles Mantoux, a French physician, developed a test method, based on the work of Koch. \nA positive test result simply says that the immune system came in contact with Mycobacteria - this does not necessarily mean that people with a positive test result have been infected with tuberculosis. Such a result, which shows as positive, even though the outcome should be negative is called \"false positive\". \nThe test shows the reaction of the immune system to tuberculin. This requires an intact immune system: People whose immune system is weakened, for example those with a HIV infection, may also show a \"false negative\": Their immune system may simply be too weak to react. Similarly, the use of certain substances, such as steroids may lead to false negatives."}

The country was known as Zaire for much of his rule.\nMobutu is commonly known as Mobutu or Mobutu Sese Seko. While in office, he formed an authoritarian regime, amassed vast personal gain, and attempted to purge the country of all colonial cultural influence. He was an anti-communist.\nDuring the Congo Crisis, Mobutu led a coup against the nationalist government of Patrice Lumumba. He wanted to take control of the government of Congo-L\u00e9opoldville. He soon became the army chief of staff. In 1965 he led a second coup to be Prime Minister. Then in 1967 he established a presidential form of government headed by himself. As part of his program of \u201cnational authenticity,\u201d Mobutu changed the Congo's name to Za\u00efre in 1971. He changed his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu established a one-party state and a cult of personality.\nDuring his reign, Mobutu built a highly centralized state. He amassed a large personal fortune through economic exploitation and corruption. Because of this some people called his rule \u201ckleptocracy.\u201d The nation suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency devaluations. By 1991 economic deterioration and unrest led him to agree to share power with opposition leaders. He used the army to stop this change. In May 1997 rebel forces, led by Laurent Kabila, removed him from the country.\nMobutu Sese Seko is notorious for the corruption, nepotism, and embezzlement of billions of dollars that took place during his reign. He also had extravagances such as Concorde-flown shopping trips to Paris. Mobutu presided over the country for some four decades, despite many reports of abuses and human-rights violations. As such, many have described him as the \"archetypal African dictator\".\nMobutu died in 1997 of prostate cancer in Morocco."}

It was created in the 1970's by Swiss biologist Hermann Brandt. Brandt believed that \"The objective of all physical activities is not to make champions, but make a contribution to building a harmonious society\". He wanted to create a team sport which did not involve the injuries which he saw as being a problem in other sports.\nThe sport is usually played on an indoor court that is by }. At each end, there is a 'frame' (a device similar to a trampoline off which the ball bounces). This frame measures . There is also a semicircular D-shaped area measuring in radius around the frame which players can not enter. The game is played with two teams of 12 players on each team. Of the twelve players on a team, seven may be on the court at any one time. Each team can score on both ends on the field. In order to score a point, the ball must be thrown by an attacking player, hit the frame and bounce outside the 'D' without being caught by the defending team. Physical contact is not allowed, and defenders may not try to stop the attacking team's passes. Players may take three steps with the ball and can hold the ball for at most three seconds. Teams may not pass the ball more than three times before shooting at the frame.\nTchoukball has become an international sport. It is played in Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Great Britain, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Macau, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States. It is governed by the F\u00e9deration Internationale de Tchoukball (FITB, founded in 1971). Taiwan hosted the 2004 World Championships and won both the women's and junior championships. The Swiss won the men's championship. The 2006, European Championships were held in Switzerland. Great Britain won both the Men's and Under-18's titles. Switzerland won the Ladies event."}

It is caused by the way light bends as it passes through layers of air of different temperatures.\nThe words \"mirage\" and \"mirror\" come from the same root word, which means \"to look at.\"\nCause.\nNormally, light travels in a straight line, but it will change direction depending on what it passes through. This bending is called \"refraction.\" Gases, such as air, become thinner as they get warmer. As a result, light tends to curve (or refract) towards the colder layer of air. This makes the image appear to come from a different direction than the original object.\nThere are two basic types of mirage, depending on which direction the temperature changes, inferior and superior.\nInferior.\nAn inferior mirage is arguably the most common type seen over land. In daytime, air near solid ground is typically warmer than the air above it. When light from the sky passes through it, a shimmering, fragmented image of the sky may appear to come from the ground, resembling water.\nSuperior.\nSometimes a mirage can appear to come from higher up than the original object. When the colder air is lower (called an inversion layer), as it often is over large bodies of water or ice, the apparent direction of the mirage will be opposite that of an inferior mirage. For example, the distorted image of a ship or an island may appear on or above the surface, even if the original object is hidden below the horizon.\nA \"Fata Morgana\" is a complex superior mirage whose appearance can change quickly and dramatically. Its name refers to Morgan le Fay, a mythical enchantress strongly associated with Arthurian legends. In times past, the disturbing images seen as part of the mirage were attributed to illusions created by magic.\nArtificial.\nA mirage-like effect can be achieved by allowing a soluble substance like sugar or salt to slowly dissolve in a deep container of water, so that there is more sugar in the water near the bottom than in the water above it. This can refract the image of an object seen through it in a similar manner as a superior mirage often seen over open water."}

He was a manufacturer, politician and a phillanthropist in Bradford, West Yorkshire.\nHis father Daniel Salt was a dry salter and then he decided to become a farmer. His mother died when he was quite young. Titus Salt had 11 children.\nCareer.\nAfter working as a woolen stapler for two years at a mill near Wakefield he became his fathers business partner-Daniel Salt and son. The company used Russian Donskio wool, which was widely used in the woollens trade, but not in worsted cloth. Titus visited the millers in Bradford.\nAfter working for two years as a wool-stapler in Wakefield he became his father's partner in the business of Daniel Salt and Son. He set up as a spinner and manufacturer.\nIn 1836, Titus came upon some bales of Alpaca wool in a warehouse in Liverpool and, after taking some samples away to experiment, came back and bought the consignment. Though he was not the first in England to work with the fibre, he was the creator of the lustrous and subsequently fashionable cloth called 'alpaca'. (The discovery was described by Charles Dickens in slightly fictionalised form in \"Household Words\").\nIn 1833 he took over his father's business and within twenty years had expanded it to be the largest employer in Bradford. In 1848 Titus Salt became mayor of Bradford. Smoke and pollution came from mills and factory chimneys. Salt tried unsuccessfully to clean up the pollution using a device called the Rodda Smoke Burner.\nAround 1850, he decided to build a mill large enough to consolidate his textile manufacture in one place, but he \"did not like to be a party to increasing that already over-crowded borough\". So he bought land three miles from the town in Shipley next to the River Aire, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Midland Railway and began building in 1851. He opened it with a grand banquet on his 50th birthday, 20 September 1853, and set about building houses, bathhouses, an institute, hospital, almshouses and churches, that make up the model village of Saltaire. He built the Congregational Church which is now Saltaire United Reformed Church, at his own expense in 1858\u201359, and donated the land on which the Wesleyan Chapel was built."}

Three policemen had been killed, and others wounded, and one of the gang was also killed. This event is known as the Houndsditch murders.\nThe gang were said to be international anarchists led by Peter Piatkow, a.k.a. \"Peter the Painter\". It is still not clear who their leader actually was.\nThe end took place at a house in Sidney Street, where word came that a gang of foreigners had moved in. In the fire that ended the siege, one fireman and two robbers died. The fates of other members of the gang, and its leader, are not known.\nThe Houndsditch murders.\nOn 16 December 1910, a gang of Jewish immigrants attempted to break into the rear of a jeweller's shop at 119 Houndsditch. A nextdoor shopkeeper heard their hammering, and told the City of London Police (in whose area the shop was). Nine unarmed officers \u2014 three sergeants and six constables (two in plain clothes) \u2014 moved towards the jewellers.\nSergeants Bentley and Bryant knocked at the door of No. 11 Exchange Buildings, behind the jeweller's shop. The gang's leader, George Gardstein, opened the door, but when he did not answer their questions they assumed he did not understand English and told him to fetch someone who did. Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared.\nThe house had a single ground-floor room, into which the front door directly opened, with a staircase leading to the upper floors on the left, and a door to the open yard at the back on the right.\nGrowing impatient, the two sergeants entered the house to find the room apparently empty, before they became aware of a man standing in the darkness at the top of the stairs. After a short conversation, another man entered through the yard door, rapidly firing a pistol, while the man on the stairs also started shooting.\nBoth officers were hit, with Bentley collapsing across the doorstep, while Bryant managed to stagger outside. In the street, Constable Woodhams ran to help Bentley, but was himself wounded by one of the gang firing from the cover of the house, as was Sergeant Tucker, who died almost instantly.\nThe gang then attempted to break out of the cul-de-sac, Gardstein being grabbed by Constable Choate almost at the entrance. In the struggle Choate was wounded several times by Gardstein, before being shot five more times by other members of the gang, who also managed to hit Gardstein in the back. They then dragged Gardstein \u00be of a mile to 59 Grove Street, where he died the next day. Constable Choate and Sergeant Bentley died in separate hospitals the same day. An intense search followed, and a number of the gang or their associates were soon arrested.\nThe Siege of Sidney Street.\nOn 2 January 1911, an informer told police that two or three members of the gang, possibly including Peter the Painter, were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, Stepney. The police were worried the suspects were about to flee, but expected heavy resistance to any attempt to capture them. On 3 January, two hundred police officers cordoned off the area and the siege began. At dawn the battle started.\nThe defenders, though heavily outnumbered, had better guns and stores of ammunition. The Tower of London was called for backup, and word got to the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill. Churchill arrived on the spot to see the situation at first hand, and to offer advice. Churchill authorised calling in a detachment of Scots Guards to assist the police.\nSix hours into the battle, and just as the field artillery piece that Churchill had authorised arrived, a fire began in the building. When the fire brigade arrived, Churchill refused them access to the building. The police stood ready, guns aimed at the front door, waiting for the men inside to attempt their escape. The door never opened. Instead, the remains of two members of the gang, Fritz Svaars and William Sokolow (both were also known by numerous aliases), were later discovered inside the building.\nNo sign of Peter the Painter was found. Besides the three policemen, a London firefighter also died of his injuries."}

She served as prime minister three times and was the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. She was the first female to be elected head of government in the world. Bandaranaike was the widow of a previous prime minister, Solomon Bandaranaike, who was murdered in 1959. Her policies were based in socialism and similar to her husband's. All three of their children later served in the Sri Lankan government.\nShe spent 40 years in political office. She resigned on 10 August 2000. Exactly two months later she died, aged 84, of a heart attack.\nFamily life.\nSirimavo Bandaranaike was born on 17 April 1916, as Sirimavo Ratwatte. Her family was part of the aristocracy. She was a Buddhist, but went to school at a convent in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where she was taught by Roman Catholic nuns. In 1940, she married Solomon Bandaranaike, who was a member of parliament at the time. He became prime minister in 1956 as the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Sirimavo and Solomon had three children, Chandrika, Sunethra and Anura.\nPolitical career.\nSirimavo did not begin a career in politics until after her husband was shot dead on 26 September 1959. She was named successor to her husband's leadership of the party. She led that party to win elections in July 1960, promising to continue her husband's policies. Bandaranaike became Prime Minister on 21 July 1960. She was the first female prime minister in the world, and the first woman to be elected head of government.\nBandaranaike was a socialist. She continued her husband's policies of nationalising major sectors of the economy. She also brought all schools that were owned by the Roman Catholic Church under the government's control. The most famous of her early policies was the Sinhala Only Act, also started by her husband but never finished. This included a plan to wikt:repatriate, send Tamil residents to India (get them Indian citizenship and deport them). It also made Sinhala the state's only official language by removing English. This was seen as discriminatory and was the beginning of human rights protests and Tamil militancy.\nThe government's takeover of foreign businesses, particularly petroleum companies, upset Britain and the United States, who both ended aid to Sri Lanka. As a result, Bandaranaike made a closer relationship with China and the Soviet Union. In 1962, Christian officers of the military made an unsuccessful attempt at a coup d'\u00e9tat. Bandaranaike lost a vote of confidence in 1964, and her party was defeated in the resulting elections in 1965. Before she was replaced, Bandaranaike's government signed an agreement with India over the status of about one million Tamils: 600,000 were to be granted Indian citizenship and repatriated, and 375,000 were to be granted Sri Lankan citizenship.\nBandaranaike became prime minister again in the 1970 elections. military aid from India and Pakistan.\nA new constitution was introduced in 1972. The monarchy was abolished, and the Commonwealth realm known as Ceylon was replaced by the modern republic of Sri Lanka. The President of Sri Lanka replaced Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.\nDuring her second term, Bandaranaike became more and more intolerant of criticism. She forced critical media outlets to shut down. She also nationalised the country's largest newspaper, \"Lake House\". Bandaranaike was chosen chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1976. Despite success in foreign affairs, she was losing popular support in Sri Lanka very quickly. Her government was accused of corruption while the economy was quickly declining. Elections were scheduled to be held in 1975, but Bandaranaike used a clause of the new constitution to delay them indefinitely. The elections took place in 1977, and her party was defeated severely. In 1980, Bandaranaike was charged with abusing her power for delaying the elections. She was forced out of her seat in parliament and banned from public office for seven years.\nBandaranaike stayed as leader of the SLFP despite losing every general election in the next ten years. Her party led a coalition (the People's Alliance) to win the general elections in 1994. Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika, became prime minister, and was then elected president the same year. Bandaranaike became prime minister again, but the constitution had changed since her last term. As prime minister she was now subordinate to her daughter, the President. She stayed in office until a few months before her death, but had little real power. She resigned on 10 August 2000. Exactly two months later she died, aged 84, of a heart attack."}

It is mainly a self-organising process. Starting from a random coil, polypeptides fold into their characteristic working shape. The structure is held together by hydrogen bonds.\nThe stages are:\nWithout its correct three-dimensional structure a protein does not work. However, some parts of proteins may not fold: this is normal.\nIf proteins do not fold into their native shape, they are inactive and are usually toxic. Several diseases are believed to result from misfolded proteins. Many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins, for the immune system does not produce antibodies for all possible protein structures.\nOn 30 November 2020, the process was solved by artificial intelligence company DeepMind.\nChaperones.\nChaperonins are large proteins which help the folding of some proteins after synthesis. Chaperones in general were first discovered helping histones and DNA join up to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the builing blocks for chromosomes. It is now clear that this is the way many cell organelles are built up."}

The idea is that a protein folding into its native structure is done automatically by the protein's amino acid sequence. It is only true for some proteins. For other proteins, chaperones are needed.\nAnfinsen shared the 1972 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on the structure of the enzyme ribonuclease A. The dogma suggests that, in the conditions at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique and stable state.\nThere are three conditions:\nHow the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of protein folding, which has a related dogma called Levinthal's paradox. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed to explore all possible conformations (1026 seconds) and choose the appropriate one.\nPrions are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal amyloid buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma."}

Leafcutter ants \"cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as nutrition for their fungal cultivars\".\nThe \"Acromyrmex\" and \"Atta\" ants have much in common anatomically; however, the two can be identified by their external differences. \"Atta\" ants have three pairs of spines and a smooth exoskeleton on the upper surface of the thorax, while \"Acromyrmex\" ants have four pairs and a rough exoskeleton.\nNext to humans, leafcutter ants form the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth. In a few years, the central mound of their underground nests can grow to more than across, with smaller, radiating mounds extending out to a radius of , taking up and containing eight million individuals.\nColony life cycle.\nReproduction and colony founding.\nWinged females and males leave their respective nests \"en masse\" and engage in a nuptial flight known as the \"revoada\". Each female mates with multiple males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs to set up a colony.\nOnce on the ground, the female loses her wings and searches for a suitable underground lair in which to found her colony. The success rate of these young queens is very low, and only 2.5% will go on to establish a long-lived colony. To start her own fungus garden, the queen stores bits of the parental fungus garden mycelium in a pocket in her mouth.\nColony hierarchy.\nIn a mature leafcutter colony, ants are divided into castes, based mostly on size, that do different work. \"Acromyrmex\" and \"Atta\" show a high degree of biological polymorphism, with four castes in established colonies - minims, minors, mediae and majors. Majors are also known as soldiers. \"Atta\" ants are more polymorphic than \"Acromyrmex\", meaning there is comparatively less difference in size from the smallest to largest types of \"Acromymex\".\nLife-style.\n\"Leaf-cutter ants are the major forest herbivores in Central America and consume more plant matter than all the vertebrate herbivores put together. Their subterranean nests can be vast and home to many millions of ants and they have a really neat defence system where minor workers ride shotgun on top of the leaf loads carried by the major workers and fend off the attacks of parasitic flies\".

It was first released on March 11, 1977.\nThe movie is made from three previously released animated short movies based upon the Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne: \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\" (1966), \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\" (1968), and \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too\" (1974). This is also the last movie in the Disney canon that Walt Disney was personally involved with, because one of the shorts (\"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\") was released during his lifetime, and he was involved in the production of \"Blustery Day\". A fifth and final short movie based on the original books, \"Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\", was released in 1983. It is included as a bonus feature on the VHS and DVD release of the movie.\nThe characters from the movie became very popular. There have been sequels, television programs, clothing, books, and toys based on the characters. The movie is different from the three individual shorts by having newly created material to link the stories together. It also has an ending to close the stories. The ending is based on the final chapter of \"The House at Pooh Corner\". It was always Walt Disney's intention to make a movie, but he decided to make shorts instead \u2014 after production had begun \u2014 to familiarize US audiences with the characters. All three shorts as well as future movies boast classic songs by the Sherman Brothers including \"Winnie the Pooh\" and \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\".\nThe movie also inspired an attraction of the same name at Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and Hong Kong Disneyland. A much more elaborate attraction, also based on the movie, opened in Tokyo Disneyland as \"Pooh's Hunny Hunt\".\nProduction.\nFor the character Piglet, hand gestures and other movements were used by the animators to make expressions, because he (and Pooh) had the look of dolls or stuffed animals with relatively simple button eyes. The scene where Rabbit deals with Pooh's being part of the \"decor of his home\" was not in the original book, but was reportedly made by Disney when he first read the book.\nReception.\nMovie critic Leonard Maltin called the original Pooh featurettes \"gems\". He also noted that the artwork resembles the book illustrations, and that the particular length of these short movies meant that the moviemakers didn't have to \"compress or protract their script.\" The movie has a 91% \"fresh\" rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.\nRuth Hill Viguers, however, when writing in \"A Critical History of Children\u2019s Literature\" during the 1960s, mentioned Disney's Winnie the Pooh along with several other Disney adaptations as having \u201cdestroyed the integrity of the original books\u201d.\nThe American Film Institute nominated \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" for its Top 10 Animated Films list.\nHome video.\n\"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" was first released on VHS, Betamax, CED videorecord, and laserdisc in the early 1980s. In 1996, it was re-released on VHS as part of the Masterpiece Collection. It included video footage of the making which was shown before the movie starts. It was released on DVD for the first time in 2002 to commemorate its 25th anniversary, with digitally restored picture and sound. The separate shorts had also been released on their own on VHS in the 1990s.\nThe 25th anniversary edition DVD includes, among other bonus features, \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: The Story Behind the Masterpiece\", which documents the history of the books and their initial movie adaptations. It also features interviews with animators Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas, and Burny Mattinson, as well as the Sherman brothers, Paul Winchell, and others. Digital Media FX reviewer Shannon Muir said that the audio and video quality of the movie on this DVD was very high.\nThe \"Friendship Edition\" DVD was re-released on June 19, 2007. All of the special features from the previous \"25th Anniversary Edition\" DVD were recycled; the only new addition being an episode of Playhouse Disney's computer-animated series \"The Book of Pooh\". The DVD re-release coincides with the 30th anniversary of the release of the movie. \nThe Blu-Ray version was released for the first time in August 2013."}

It was produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is a sequel to \"Fantasia\" (1940). Like the earlier movie, it has animated segments set to pieces of classical music. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" is the only segment that is in both movies.\nThe soundtrack was performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with conductor James Levine. A group of celebrities introduce each segment in live-action scenes. The celebrities include Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Penn &amp; Teller, James Earl Jones, Quincy Jones and Angela Lansbury.\n\"Fantasia 2000\" was shown at Carnegie Hall on December 17, 1999. It was part of a five-city concert tour, with performances in London, Paris, Tokyo and Pasadena, California. An exclusive release in IMAX theatres followed from January 1 to April 30, 2000. It became the first animated feature-length movie in the IMAX format. \"Fantasia 2000\" was opened in the United States on June 16, 2000. It has earned $90.8 million in gross revenue worldwide.\n\"Rhapsody in Blue\".\n\"Rhapsody in Blue\" is the first \"Fantasia\" segment with music from the American composer George Gershwin. It originated in 1992 when director and animator Eric Goldberg approached Al Hirschfeld about the idea of an animated short set to Gershwin's composition in the style of Hirschfeld's illustrations. Hirschfeld agreed to serve as artistic consultant and allowed the animators to use and adapt his previous works for the segment. Goldberg's wife Susan was art director. Duke is named after jazz artist Duke Ellington. The bottom of his toothpaste tube reads \"NINA\", an Easter egg referencing Hirschfeld's daughter Nina. Rachel was designed after the Goldbergs' daughter and John is based on animation historian and author John Culhane and Hirschfeld's caricature of Alexander Woollcott. Goldberg took Hirschfeld's original illustration of Gershwin and animated it to make him play the piano. Featured in the crowd emerging from the hotel are depictions of Brooks Atkinson and Hirschfeld, along with his wife Dolly Haas. The segment was completed two months ahead of schedule from February 1999 to April 1999. The animators from the production hiatus of \"Kingdom of the Sun\" were reassigned to work on the segment. Despite this, the sequence was so chromatically complex that the rendering process using the CAPS system delayed work on \"Tarzan\"."}

It was made by Walt Disney Animation Studios released on December 15, 2000, and is the 40th motion picture produced by Disney. The title refers to the fairy tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" by Hans Christian Andersen, but has little in common with the fairy tale.\nThe movie received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song for \"My Funny Friend and Me\" performed by Sting. It lost against \"Things Have Changed\" by Bob Dylan from \"Wonder Boys\".\nA direct-to-video sequel, \"Kronk's New Groove\", was released in December 2005. There was also an animated television series, \"The Emperor's New School\", in January 2006.\nPlot.\nKuzco (David Spade) is a selfish, bratty South American emperor, who lives the high life and punishes those who offend him. He summons Pacha (John Goodman), the leader of a local village, and tells him he intends to build a lavish resort called Kuzcotopia for himself, destroying the village. Pacha attempts to protest but is dismissed. Meanwhile, Yzma (Eartha Kitt), Kuzco's aged adviser, who is angry about him firing her, decides to get revenge on the emperor so she can take over the throne. She and her muscle-bound but dimwitted lackey Kronk (Patrick Warburton), organize a dinner for Kuzco, where they plan to poison him, but the plan goes awry when the emperor is transformed into a llama.\nAfter knocking him unconscious, Yzma orders Kronk to dispose of Kuzco. He does so and throws his unconscious body into a river, but has a change of heart, and saves him at the last second, accidentally losing him on Pacha's cart. When he arrives at the village, Kuzco wakes up and orders Pacha to return him to the palace. Pacha agrees, but only if he builds his resort somewhere else. Kuzco refuses and, against Pacha's warnings, decides to travel back to the palace on his own, but ends up lost in the jungle where he is nearly killed by black panthers and is rescued by Pacha. Meanwhile, Yzma seizes control of the empire, but when she learns Kuzco has survived, she and Kronk search for him.\nKuzco seemingly agrees with Pacha's demands, but during the journey to the palace, the two fight on a collapsing bridge when Kuzco reveals he still intends to destroy the village. Working together, the two climb out of the valley, after the bridge collapses. During their search, Yzma and Kronk end up in the jungle and take directions from Bucky, a squirrel who Kuzco had encountered earlier.\nKuzco and Pacha arrive at a roadside diner; unbeknown to them, Yzma and Kronk have followed them there. While Kuzco complains to the chef, Pacha eavesdrops on Yzma's plan, and tries to warn Kuzco that she is planning to kill him; however, he refuses to listen, convinced that Yzma is loyal to him, and reveals that he plans to go back on his word and destroy Pacha's village. When he overhears her planning to kill him due to his selfishness, he leaves the diner on his own and consigns himself to live out his life as a normal llama, before reuniting and reconciling with Pacha. When the two return to his house to pick up supplies, they discover Yzma and Kronk have arrived, searching for them.\nPacha has his family distract Yzma and Kronk, giving him and Kuzco a head-start as they travel to the palace to find a potion to reverse the effects of the curse; however, they are ambushed by Yzma and Kronk, who somehow beat them to the palace. When Yzma orders Kronk to kill the two, he is hesitant, prompting her to insult him and his cooking, prompting him to betray her, but she drops him down a trapdoor. Yzma then summons the palace guards, who are transformed into animals, tricking them into thinking they murdered Kuzco, forcing the pair to flee with an armful of potions (Yzma intentionally knocked them to the floor as a means of preventing Kuzco and Pacha finding the right one), and during their pursuit, Kuzco is turned into various animals. When the duo is cornered, Kuzco and Yzma struggle over the vials, crushing one and transforming Yzma into a cat.\nKuzco and Pacha team up to retrieve the potion, which Yzma snatches, but is knocked out by Kronk, who found a secret exit. Pacha gives Kuzco the potion, and he is transformed back into a human. Later, having realized the consequences of his selfishness, takes Pacha's suggestion to move Kuzcotopia to a neighboring hill. He later joins Pacha and his family at a smaller resort, and elsewhere Kronk becomes a scout leader, training a group of scouts, including Yzma as a cat.\nProduction.\nAccording to the 2002 documentary The Sweatbox, The Emperor's New Groove started production in late 1994 by Roger Allers as Kingdom of the Sun, a more traditional Disney animated movie. By 1997 with the releases of both Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame and their financial failures, the executives wanted something more comedic and less formulaic.\nAnnie Awards.\nAnnie Awards are an award each year for animated movies."}

Small Smiles has 70 centers in 22 states and Washington, DC. It has its headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee. The clinics are called many names, including Children's Dental Clinic, Indian Springs Dental Clinic, Oklahoma Smiles, Small Smiles Dentistry, Texas Smiles, and Wild Smiles.\nHistory.\nThe clinic comes from a dental clinic in Pueblo, Colorado that was started in 1928. The DeRose family and Dr. William Mueller owned the company.\nIn 2003 Michael DeRose, one of the DeRoses, bought a very expensive house in Pueblo for $3.4 million. When they owned the clinics, they put children in \"papoose boards\" to stop them from moving so they could quickly do dental work. The State of Colorado made a law to limit how much they could use the papoose boards. The offices also did lots of dental work on the children and put a lot of crowns on the children's teeth, so the Colorado government said that the clinics could only place a specified number crowns for each day. In 2006 the DeRose family sold the company to new owners.\nIn 2007 a news reporter named Roberta Baskin filmed the inside of a Small Smiles clinic. The film showed children screaming as the dentists did work on them, as the children were held in papoose boards. The main dentist said that, in one time, they often did six or more baby root canals on a child. He also said the clinic had goals to do a certain amount of dental work so the clinic could make money. The news report went on television and people began filing lawsuits against Small Smiles. A woman from Kentucky named Debbie Hagan started a blog that was against Small Smiles and what it did. Journalists and people from the New York State government talked to Hagan to learn about what was happening. On November 14, 2008, Small Smiles sued Hagan, saying that she published their documents without their permission. On April 16, 2009 the company stopped the lawsuit.\nThe US government filed a lawsuit against Small Smiles for cheating it of money that was to be spent on dental work for poor children. Small Smiles agreed to pay $24 million to the US government so the lawsuit would be ended. In February 2012 Small Smiles asked for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection."}

He was wounded in the Spanish Succession War at H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. In 1715, after the death of his father, he left the Army and governed the duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen.\nLike many German princes, He wanted his duchy to have the splendor of the court of the King Louis XIV of France. This caused him to be ruined financially.\nBecause he always needed money, he raised taxes and sold towns. He sold the county of Cuylenburg which was the dowry of his wife. The county was sold in 1720. He did not sell it to pay any money he owed to others. It was sold so that a garden and a channel could be built in his palace. In 1723 the Schalkau was sold to the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. At the time, Schalkau had city privileges, and the right to hold a market. What was sold was an administrative division, much like a county, only smaller, which included Schalkau. The sale without the agreement of his wife was illegal. This led to a war with Saxe-Meiningen. At the end of the war, all of the county was ruined.\nBecause of his very bad taxes, in 1717 an open revolt took place in the duchy.\nFamily.\nErnst Frederick married Countess Sophia Albertine of Erbach-Erbach in Erbach on 4 February 1704.

Its headquarters are in Phoenix, Arizona. Under the name \"Big Smiles,\" it coordinates dentist vans that go to American schools and do dental checkups and dental work on poor children. In 2011 the dentists that do business with the company went to 8,700 schools and screened and/or worked on 488,000 children.\nHistory.\nMichael Howell and Daniel Goldsmith started the ReachOut company in 1997. At first the company coordinated dental checkups and dental work for people in nursing homes in Michigan. The company began coordinating services to schools. It later began doing coordination for schools, foster programs, group homes, homeless shelters, and mental health facilities by late 2003.\nIn October 2011 a Camp Verde, Arizona boy who had dental work done by a dentist linked with ReachOut complained of pain. His mother, Stacey Gagnon, said that the dentist did dental work on the boy without asking the parents if it was okay. Darren and Stacey Gagnon, the parents of the boy, sued the dentist and the Reachout company. In November 2011, Dan Brown, then the superintendent of the Camp Verde Unified School District, signed a letter saying that ReachOut cannot go to the district's schools anymore.\nAt one time ReachOut had dentists go to schools in the Clark County School District, the biggest school district in the state of Nevada. In December 2011 the district stopped working with ReachOut.\nKen Tucker, a reporter for the newspaper \"Arizona Republic\", said said that some parents at the schools said that ReachOut dentists did dental work without telling the parents. He said that the main reason was that ReachOut did not give good care after the dental work was done because the dentists only came to the school two times per year. A mobile dentist who worked with ReachOut, Derryl Brian, said that the dentists under ReachOut had, since 2006, done screenings and work on 80,000 children. Brian said that a lot of people liked what they did.\nSeveral school districts in Arizona, as of August 2012, still work with ReachOut. ReachOut gave care for over 2,000 students of the Peoria Unified School District in Greater Phoenix. ReachOut gave care to twenty Peoria USD schools that have lots of poor children. The ReachOut website has leters from a school nurse in Tucson, Arizona and an elementary school principal of the Deer Valley Unified School District in Greater Phoenix which say good things about ReachOut."}

She was the widow of Alois Hitler and the mother of German dictator Adolf Hitler.\nFamily background and marriage.\nKlara was born in the Austrian village of Spital, Weitra, Lower Austria. Her father was Johann Baptist P\u00f6lzl and her mother was Johanna Hiedler. Either Hiedler's father, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, or his brother, Johann Georg Hiedler, was the biological father of Alois Hitler, the man she would later marry. It is presumed and accepted by most that the father was Johann Georg Hiedler. Klara and Alois were first cousins once removed.\nIn 1876, three years after Alois Hitler's first marriage to Anna Glasl-H\u00f6rer, Klara's uncle Alois had hired her as a household servant. She was 16 years old at the time. After the death of his second wife, Franziska Matzelsberger, in 1884, Alois and Klara were married on 7 January 1885 in a wedding held early in the morning at Hitler's rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn in Braunau. Alois then went to work for the day at his job as a customs official. Klara still called Alois \"uncle\" after the marriage. Their first son, Gustav, was born four months later, on 15 May 1885. Their second child, Ida, was born on 23 September 1886. Both infants died of diphtheria during the winter of 1886-1887. A third child, Otto, was born and died in 1887.\nAdolf was born 20 April 1889, followed by Edmund on 24 March 1894 and Paula on 21 January 1896. Edmund died of measles on 28 February 1900, at the age of five. Klara's adult life was spent keeping house and raising children. According to Smith, Alois had little understanding or interest in raising children. Historian Alice Miller later wrote, \"The family structure could well be characterized as the prototype of a totalitarian regime. Its sole, undisputed, often brutal ruler is the father. The wife and children are totally subservient to his will, his moods, and his whims; they must accept humiliation and injustice unquestioningly and gratefully. Obedience is their primary rule of conduct.\"\nKlara was very devoted to her children. According to William Patrick Hitler, she was a typical stepmother to her stepchildren, Alois Jr. and Angela.\nKlara was a devout Roman Catholic. She worshipped at church regularly with her children. Of her six children with Alois, only Adolf and Paula survived childhood.\nAlois's and Klara's children were:\nLater life and death.\nWhen Alois died in 1903, he left her a government pension. She sold the house in Leonding and moved with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in Linz. Three or four years later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After many painful iodoform treatments given by her doctor, Eduard Bloch, Klara died at home in Linz from the toxic medical side-effects on December 21, 1907. Adolf and Paula were at her side. Klara was buried in Leonding near Linz.\nAdolf Hitler had a close relationship with his mother. He was crushed by her death and carried the grief for the rest of his long life. Bloch later recalled that, after Klara's death, he had seen in \"one young man never so much pain and suffering broken fulfilled\". Decades later, in 1940, Hitler showed gratitude to Bloch (who was Jewish) by letting him and his wife to leave Austria and go to the United States."}

Normal transcription involves the synthesis of RNA from DNA; reverse transcription is the \"reverse\" of this. It is a DNA polymerase enzyme that transcribes single-stranded RNA into single-stranded DNA. It also synthesizes a second strand of DNA complementary to the reverse-transcribed single-stranded cDNA. \nWell studied reverse transcriptases include:\nHistory.\nReverse transcriptase was discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in a cancer virus. It was independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).\nThe idea of reverse transcription was very unpopular at first because it contradicted the central dogma of molecular biology. This states that DNA is transcribed into RNA which is then translated into proteins. However, in 1970 when Howard Temin and David Baltimore both independently discovered the enzyme responsible for reverse transcription, the possibility that genetic information could be passed on in this manner was finally accepted.\nOut of this work has come the idea that the first genomes were made of RNA genes. The RNA genes surviving today might be all that remain of this early condition. Reverse transcriptase might be the remnant of a stage when DNA genes were made by copying RNA genes. This theory is relevant to the earliest stages of evolution. Reverse transcription is also used by various semi-independent elements called transposons."}

Over time, those bacteria change to develop a resistance to the antibiotics. Called antibiotic resistance, this is one of the most serious problems facing modern surgery and medicine. It is also one of the best examples of evolution in action.\nAntibiotic resistance spreads very quickly, far faster than microbiologists expected. \"As long as new drugs keep coming, resistance is not a problem. \"But there has not been a new class of antibiotics discovered since the 1980s\"\".\nThis was true until recently. Some scientists have developed new antibiotics to combat resistant bacteria. However, there is a lag-time of about eight years between discovery and possible availability for general use. The process is also extremely costly.\nNatural selection in action.\nA well-known example of natural selection in action is the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. Natural populations of bacteria contain, among their vast numbers of individual members, considerable variation in their genetic material, as the result of mutations. When exposed to antibiotics, most bacteria die quickly, but some may have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible. If the exposure to antibiotics is short, these individuals will survive the treatment. This selective elimination of maladapted individuals from a population is natural selection.\nPrediction.\nIn Fleming's 1945 Nobel Prize lecture he said:\nMaclyn McCarty explained what it was like before antibiotics:\nMechanism.\nThe mechanisms of which the bacteria undergo to become antibiotic resistant are via genetic mutation and horizontal gene transfer. \nEffect on surgery and medicine.\nAll surgery that involves cutting open the body poses massive risks of infection. Antibiotics given before and after surgery allow surgeons to do operations that would have been deadly before. Open-heart surgery is one obvious example.\nCancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage the immune system. Antibiotics are prescribed to boost the body's natural defences. Patients with organ transplants always use drugs to suppress the immune system, otherwise it attacks the transplant. Therefore, antibiotics are used to protect the body. Without effective antibiotics, both sets of patients might die from infections which their immune systems could no longer control.\nMedical uses are also threatened. The number of tests coming back with resistance to carbapenems, one of the most powerful groups of antibiotics, has soared from a handful of cases in 2003 to more than 300 cases by 2010. \"My lab is seeing an increasing number of resistant strains year on year,\" said Prof Neil Woodford, of the Health Protection Agency's antimicrobial resistance unit. Most cases are resistant to some drugs. Even worse, there are a few cases of strains which \"no antibiotic can touch\".\nMany infections which were almost eliminated are coming back. The sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat. Around the world, multi-drug resistant and extremely-drug resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem. Only a couple of drugs still work.\nInfections that hit the elderly when they are in hospital are one of the main concerns. The greatest threat in the UK is opportunistic bugs which live in the gut such as \"E. coli\" and \"Klebsiella\".\nThey are now the most common form of infection which patients get in hospital. They show rising levels of resistance to antibiotics.\nOfficial warning.\nThe UK Cabinet Office has issued a warning by the National Risk Register for Civil Emergencies. It says \"the number of infections complicated by antimicrobial resistance could increase markedly over the next 20 years\".\n\"Without effective antibiotics, even minor surgery and routine operations could become high-risk procedures, leading to increased duration of illness and ultimately premature mortality\".\nWorld Health Organization.\nThe WHO has issued similar assessments:\nThe WHO has now listed the world's most threatening superbugs. Antibiotic resistant infections are being seen all over the world.\nExamples.\nGiven enough time, and repeated exposure to the antibiotic, a population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge. This leads to what is known as an evolutionary arms race, or co-evolution, in which bacteria continue to develop strains that are less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers continue to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects, and with malarial resistance to quinine.\nGonorrhoea.\nA man in the UK has caught the \"world's worst-ever case\" of gonorrhoea, a sexually-transmitted disease. The main treatment by antibiotics azithromycin and ceftriaxone has failed to cure the disease. An authority said \"This is the first time a case has displayed such high-level resistance to both of these drugs and to most other commonly used antibiotics\".\nMethicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\".\nNew strains of Methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\" (MRSA) have emerged that are resistant the next generation of drugs.\nTuberculosis.\nTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It is caused by various types of mycobacteria, usually \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\". The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. The pathogen can travel through the air, and spread from one person to the next. Experts believe that one third of the world population is infected with \"M. tuberculosis\". New infections occur at a rate of one per second.\nDrug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. \"Extensively drug-resistant TB\" is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs.\nTotally drug-resistant TB was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012. It is resistant to all currently used drugs.\nMalaria.\nMalaria infections are not caused by bacteria: they are caused by a protozoan parasite injected into the blood by a mosquito. They are normally treated by a \ncombination of two drugs, artemether-lumefantrine. Now four cases have occurred in Britain where the drugs have failed. The patients got the disease in Africa. A doctor said \"It is an early sign and we need to take it quite seriously as it may be snowballing into something with greater impact\".\nTeixobactin.\n\"Teixobactin\" is an antibiotic discovered in 2015, the first new antibiotic discovered for forty years. It is not yet licensed for general use. It works against all gram-positive bacteria such as \"Staphylococcus aureus\" and against some other bacteria such as \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\"."}

A member of the Republican Party, he is the Minority Leader of the Senate, succeeding Chuck Schumer. He is the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Kentucky history.\nEarly life.\nMitch McConnell was born to Julia (n\u00e9e Shockley) and Addison Mitchell McConnell at Helen Keller Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama on February 20, 1942. He grew up in segregated Athens, Alabama. They moved to southern Louisville, Kentucky and McConnell attended the duPont Manual High School.

He graduated in 1967 from the University of Kentucky College of Law.\nCareer.\nIn 1984, McConnell ran for the United States Senate against two-term Democratic incumbent Walter \"Dee\" Huddleston. The election race wasn't decided until the last polls returned came in, and McConnell won by a thin margin\u2014only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million votes cast, just over 0.4%. \nMcConnell was the only Republican Senate challenger to win that year, despite Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in the presidential election.

They live in the southern part of Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and parts of Iran. They live in dry rocky regions, dry grasslands and deserts.\nDescription.\nLeopard geckos are around 7-9 inches (17.8-22.9\u00a0cm avg female)&amp; (20-28 avg male) long, with large heads, big eyes with oval-shaped pupils, thin toes, and, unlike other reptiles, they have eyelids. They have thick tails that narrow to a point and, like their bodies and heads, are slightly flattened from top to bottom. Most of their scales are small and rough. Spaced rows of larger, bumpy scales give them a knobby, rough look, but they are actually soft when touched.\nBaby leopard geckos are 85\u00a0\nmm long when they hatch, and when they hatch they have dark bands which go around their bodies.These bands lighten as the babies grow into adults which have spots instead of bands. Leopard geckos are normally lavender or yellow in colour, but pet leopard geckos come in different \"colour morphs\" like albino, \"Banana blizzard\", \"Blizzard\", \"Ghost\", \"High Yellow\", \"Hyper Xanthic\", \"Jungle\", \"Leucistic\", \"Normal\" or \"Wild\", \"Patternless\", \"Red-stripe\", \"Snow\", \"Tremper Albino\" and many more.\nLike many lizards, the leopard gecko has a tail that breaks off when grabbed by a predator. The tail breaks at a crack in the vertebra, and the surrounding muscles are arranged so that they separate neatly and instantly. A muscle closes around the artery in the tail at the point of the break and stops blood loss. Normally a new tail grows back. This method helps the leopard gecko to escape when attacked. Leopard geckos also have teeth and they are born with about 100 teeth. \nHabitat.\nThe leopard gecko is found in dry rocky regions, dry grasslands and deserts of southern Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and parts of Iran.\nThe temperatures of these areas during winter can be quite low, below , forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called \"brumation\", and they live on fat reserves. Leopard geckos are crepuscular reptiles; during the day they hide in burrows, but they are active at dawn and dusk when the temperature is favorable.\nBehavior.\nLeopard Geckos are friendly, docile creatures by nature, but they sometimes bite. If held in a human hand they will only bite if they mistake a finger for food, or if the person is holding the gecko too tightly.\nFeeding.\nIn the wild, leopard geckos feed mainly on insects, fruits, spiders, snails, small lizards, birds, and bird eggs. In captivity they feed on mealworms, crickets, and sometimes baby mice.\nReproduction.\nLeopard geckos reach sexual maturity at the age of one to three years. Mating usually happens during the rainy season. During courtship, the male walks alongside the female, licking and lightly biting her side. He then grasps her neck in his mouth. If she accepts to mate with him, she lifts her tail allowing the male to insert one of his paired copulatory organs, called hemipenes. Female leopard geckos can store sperm in their reproductive tracts for 15 months or more. They can lay up to five clutches of one or (usually) two eggs during the five month breeding season, and may use some of the stored sperm to fertilize each clutch. The eggs hatch after around 55 days.\nSubspecies.\nThere are five subspecies of the Leopard gecko:"}
{"id": "367026", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367026", "title": "Pitchblende", "text": "Pitchblende is a radioactive, uranium-rich mineral and ore. It has a chemical composition that is largely UO2, but also contains UO3 and oxides of lead, thorium, and rare earth elements. It is known as pitchblende due to its black color and high density. It is also commonly referred to as Uraninite. The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. Pitchblende found in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium.\nPitchblende contains a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Because the uranium isotopes 238U and 235U will decay to form the lead isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb, pitchblende also always contains small amounts of lead. Small amounts of helium are also present in pitchblend as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in pitchblende after having been discovered in the Sun's atmosphere.\nOccurrence.\nPitchblende is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Canada. Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, Germany, England, and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of New Hampshire, Connecticut, North Carolina, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.\nUranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium."}
{"id": "367030", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367030", "title": "Rare earth element", "text": "Rare earth elements (\"REEs\") are a set of seventeen chemical elements. They include the fifteen lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium. Scandium and yttrium are rare earth elements since they are often found in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and have similar chemical properties.\nAlthough they are called rare, rare earth elements are not extremely rare on Earth. They were called this because they are spread very evenly over the Earth, so it is hard to find a lot in one place. Promethium is rare, because it is radioactive, and decays.\nCerium, one of the lanthanides, is the 25th most common element in the Earth's crust. However, most rare earth elements are not found concentrated or in pure forms.\nList of rare earth elements.\nA table listing the seventeen rare earth elements, their atomic number and symbol, the origin of their names, and some of their uses is provided here. Some of the rare earths are named after the scientists who discovered them, and some are named based on where they were discovered.\nOrigin.\nRare earth elements are heavier than iron. They are made by supernovae (exploding stars). In nature, fission of uranium-238 creates very small amounts of radioactive promethium. Most promethium is synthetically created in nuclear reactors.\nRare earth elements change through time in small quantities (ppm, parts per million). Their proportion can be used for geologic dating and dating fossils.\nGeological distribution.\nThe rare earth elements are often found together. The longest-lived isotope of promethium has a half life of 17.7 years. Because of this, the element exists in nature in only very small amounts. Promethium is one of the two elements that do not have stable (non-radioactive) isotopes and are followed by stable elements (the other being technetium).\nBecause all lanthanides are close in size, the rare earth elements have always been hard to separate. Even with eons of geological time, separation of the lanthanides in nature has only rarely gone farther than the separation between light versus heavy lanthanides, otherwise known as the cerium and yttrium earths. This geochemical separation is shown in the first two rare earths that were discovered. These were yttria in 1794 and ceria in 1803. When first found, each was a mixture of all of the rare earths. Large ore bodies of the cerium earths can be found around the world and are being exploited. Ore bodies for yttrium are rarer. Also, they are usually smaller and less concentrated.\nGlobal rare earth production.\nUntil 1948, most of the world's rare earths came from sand deposits in India and Brazil. Through the 1950s, South Africa mined most of the world's rare earths. This happened after large veins of a rare earth bearing mineral were found there. Through the 1960s until the 1980s, a mine in California was the leading producer. Today, the Indian and South African deposits still make some rare earth concentrates, but they are very small compared to the amount being produced in China. China had produced over 95% of the world's rare earth supply. Most of this has been done in Inner Mongolia, even though it had only 37% of proven reserves. Although these numbers have since been said to have lowered to 90% of global production and a proven reserve rate of only 23% by 2012. All of the world's heavy rare earths (such as dysprosium) come from Chinese rare earth sources such as the polymetallic Bayan Obo deposit. In 2010, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) released a study which found that the United States had 13 million metric tons of rare earth elements.\nNew demand for these elements is higher than the supply of them. The world may soon face a shortage of the rare earths. In several years from 2009, worldwide demand for rare earth elements is expected to be more than the supply by 40,000 tonnes each year unless new sources are developed.\nChina.\nThese concerns have gotten larger because of the actions of China. China has said it will put regulations on exports and work to stop smuggling. On September 1, 2009, China said it is going to lower its exports to 35,000 tons per year in 2010\u20132015. China said that this was done to conserve rare resources and protect the environment. On October 19, 2010 \"China Daily\" reported that China will \"further reduce quotas for rare earth exports by 30 percent at most next year to protect the precious metals from over-exploitation\". At the end of 2010 China said that the first round of exports in 2011 for rare earths would be 14,446 tons. This was a 35% decrease from the first round of exports in 2010. In September 2011 China said it was stopping production at three of its eight rare earth mines. These mines produced almost 40% of China's total rare earth production. In August 2012, China said there would be another 20% reduction in production.\nOutside of China.\nBecause of the increased demand and the restrictions on exports of the metals from China, some countries are stockpiling rare earth resources. Searches for new sources in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, Greenland, and the United States are taking place. Mines in these countries were closed when China undercut world prices in the 1990s. It will take a few years to restart production.\nThe European Union has urged the Denmark protectorate Greenland to restrict Chinese development of rare-earth projects there, as China accounts for 95 percent of the world\u2019s current supply. As of early 2013, the government of Greenland has said that it has no plans to impose such restrictions.\nNuclear reprocessing is another possible source of rare earth or any other elements. Nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium creates a many elements as well as all their isotopes. However, it is not likely that creating them can be done safely and economically because of the radioactivity of many of these isotopes.\nRecycling.\nAnother source of rare earths is electronic waste and other wastes that have a large amount of rare earth components. New advances in recycling technology have made getting the rare earths from these materials easier to do. Recycling plants are currently operating in Japan, where there is about 300,000 tons of rare earths in unused electronics. In France, the Rhodia group is setting up two factories in La Rochelle and Saint-Fons. These factories will produce 200 tons a year of rare earths from used fluorescent lamps, magnets and batteries.\nGeo-political considerations.\nChina has said that resource depletion and environmental concerns are the reasons for increased nationwide control of its rare earth mineral production. Non-environmental reasons have also been suggested to explain China's rare earth policy. According to \"The Economist\", \"Slashing their exports of rare-earth metals...is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain, so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials.\"\nThe United States Department of Energy in its 2010 Critical Materials Strategy report identified dysprosium as the element that was most critical in terms of import reliance.\nA 2011 report issued by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Department of the Interior, \u201cChina\u2019s Rare-Earth Industry,\" deals with industry trends in China. It looks at national policies that may guide the future of the country's production. The report says that China\u2019s lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has grown over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons. China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: \u201cOwing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years.\u201d In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. By 2011, there were only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers. The government\u2019s future policies will likely keep in place strict controls: \u201cAccording to China\u2019s draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [metric tons] during the period from 2009 to 2015. The export quota for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 [metric tons] and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths.\u201d\nThe United States Geological Survey is searching southern Afghanistan for rare earth deposits under the protection of United States military forces. Since 2009, the USGS has done remote surveys as well as fieldwork to verify Soviet claims that volcanic rocks containing rare earth metals exist in Helmand province near the village of Khanneshin. The USGS has found an area of rocks in the center of an extinct volcano with light rare earth elements including cerium and neodymium. It has mapped 1.3 million metric tons of useful rock. This is about 10 years of supply at current demand levels. The Pentagon has estimated its value at about $7.4 billion.\nRare earth pricing.\nRare earth elements are not exchange-traded in the same way that precious (for instance, gold and silver) or non-ferrous metals (such as nickel, tin, copper, and aluminium) are. Instead, they are sold on the private market. This makes their prices hard to monitor and track. However, prices are published periodically on websites such as mineralprices.com. The 17 elements are not usually sold in their pure form. They are usually distributed in mixtures of varying purity, e.g. \"Neodymium metal \u2265 99.5%\". because of this, pricing can vary based on the quantity and quality required by the end user."}

He was Governor and then Premier of this province in British India.\nBackground and early life.\nSikandar Hayat was the son of Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan, CSI, of the Khattar tribe of Wah.\nAfter initial education at the Aligarh school and the MAO College at Aligarh (later to become the Aligarh Muslim University), he went for higher education to the King's College London. On returning home, in 1915, he enrolled as an Assistant Recruiting Officer in the Punjab, to help the British Indian Army's efforts during the First World War; and was later one of the very first natives to receive the King's Commission, as a Captain of the 67th Punjabis (later the 1st Battalion of the 2 Punjab Regiment) in 1919. After the war he started his own business ventures and also entered grassroots politics in his area.\nLater life and career.\nIn the 1920s, Sikandar Hayat Khan slowly began to make his mark as a statesman, and in collaboration with Sir Fazli Husain and Sir Chotu Ram became one of the founders of the Unionist Party (Punjab). This was a secular party representing all Punjabis of different creeds mostly united by the \"zamindar\" (rural/agrarian) interest, and it soon became the most popular political group in the province. Due to his special services at this time, in various ways, the Government of British India granted a knighthood to Sir Sikandar. Between 1932 and 1934 he also had the unique honour of being the only native to be appointed acting Governor of the Punjab under British rule.\nThereafter, for a brief while, Sir Sikandar also worked as Deputy-Governor of the Reserve Bank of India but in July 1936, on the demise of Sir Fazli Husain, he returned to take on leadership of the Unionist party for the general elections held in Winter of the same year, winning by a simple majority and forming a coalition government along with the Indian National Congress and the Sikh Akali Dal. Sikandar was now chosen as Leader of the House and the Premier or Chief Minister of the Punjab. He remained in this position from 1937 to December 1942, when he died of a sudden heart failure.\nRole in the Second World War.\nBetween 1939 and 1942, when he died, Sir Sikandar supported the British struggle against Nazi Germany and believed in cooperating with the British government in the Second World War. He believed that this support would be good for India and help it towards independence after the War ended. He was very active in maximizing recruitment of troops from the Punjab as part of the 'war effort' and even made morale-boosting tours of the Middle East where most Indian (especially Punjabi)troops where serving. The Muslim League leadership agreed with this perspective of his and also announced full cooperation with the British Raj, or government, to achieve their own ends.\nMuslim League and Lahore Resolution.\nSoon after winning the general elections in 1937, Sir Sikandar felt conscious of the need to maintain a balanced stance in a volatile and divided Punjabi political system. He thus decided to also negotiate with the All India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. As a result, he and Jinnah signed the Jinnah-Sikandar Pact at Lucknow in October 1937, merging the Muslim elements of his powerful Unionist party with the Muslim League, as a move towards forming a common, united front for safeguarding their community rights and interests in India. He was also later one of the chief supporters and architects of the Lahore Resolution, March 1940, calling for an autonomous or semi-independent Muslim majority region within the larger Indian confederation\u2014which demand later led to the demand for an independent Pakistan.\nDeath and Legacy.\nAt the time of his sudden death in December 1942, Sir Sikandar was honoured by the people of Lahore and granted burial outside the old Badshahi Mosque there, on the other side from Allama Muhammad Iqbal, the poet. Much of his work was left half done, in particular his plan to help the British war effort towards eventual Indian freedom, and his attempts to weld the Punjab together and save it from communal friction. Many historians have opined that Sir Sikandar's early demise at the age of 50 was, arguably, a major blow to the Indian freedom movements, especially to the Punjab. He wished to preserve this intact, within a larger Indian Confederation whereby his own Muslim community could enjoy full and maximum freedom and self-governance without truncating India or the Punjab region. He was too well aware of the potential bloodbath and conflict resulting from any such division or separation which, alas, was witnessed on such massive scale at the time of the August 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan. It would thus not be wrong to say that Sir Sikandar's presence would certainly have been a 'moderating influence\u2014and his death must be reckoned a great misfortune [at the time]\".\nIndirectly, however, in due course, his eldest son Shaukat Hayat Khan, would take on a significant role in assisting the All India Muslim League in winning an independent Pakistan, finally, in a somewhat different interpretation of the father's intentions."}

The background color of its fur varies from dark gray-brown through yellowish gray to red-brown. The flanks and back are strikingly marked with large, irregular, dark-edged blotches. The legs and underparts are marked with black dots, and the tail is marked with black spots and rings. There are spots on the forehead and crown, which merge into narrow longitudinal stripes on the neck and irregular stripes on the back.\nHabitat.\nThe marbled cat is found in northern India, Nepal, Guangxi and Yunnan provinces in China, and south through Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), and Borneo. Throughout its range it is thought to be rare, although it has also been suggested that the perception of the marbled cat's rarity may be caused by its secretive nature and its preference for remote forest areas."}

Leslie was soon playing all styles of music, from ragtime to classical.\nHis adoptive mother encouraged his talent for the piano. By 1980, Leslie was giving concerts in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Because of his new fame, he was asked to be on many television programs such as CBC's \"Man Alive\" (hosted by Roy Bonisteel), \"CBS Evening News\", \"60 Minutes\", and \"That's Incredible!\".

{"id": "367337", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367337", "title": "Karlal", "text": "The Karlal (Urdu: \u06a9\u0631\u0691\u0627\u0644 also known as Kard'al, Karaal, Karhral, or Kiraal) is a Hindko-speaking tribe in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The majority of the tribe is found mainly in Abbottabad District, inhabiting the hilly area of the Galyat and the Nara tract. A minority are also settled in the Haripur District. A small number are also found in neighbouring Azad Kashmir, in Kotli District. Many Karlal now prefer the self-designation Sardar which means Sultan Chief in Farsi.\nEarly history.\nThe tribe trace their descent from a Sardar Kallar Shah, son of Sultan Sujann Shah, who is believed to have come from southern Afghanistan. It is believed that he was a descendant of Alexander the Great. In Haripur and Abbottabad, they are known as Sultan Chief Sardars, a name they acquired during the time of the Delhi Sultanate (1206\u20131296), when the tribal members were made rulers of the galliyat region of Hazara. There is also some argument as to the religion of the Karlal, as whether they were Hindu or not. As some of the oldest inhabitants of Hazara, a region that was largely Hindu till the early 13th Century, it is likely that they were either Hindus, or strongly influenced by Hinduism.\nIn the middle ages.\nIt does seem that throughout the middle ages, the Karlal maintained their independence. During Mughal era (1550-1730), when the Gakkars were trying to extend their authority in the entire lower Hazara from their base in Khanpur in what is now Haripur District, the leader of Karlal tribe Morcha Kulli Khan at that time was able to murder the Ghakkar chief and retained his tribes independence. Similarly the Turks, whose territory lay to the north, were also never able to extend their authority over this tribe although enjoying suzerainty over large portion of Pakhal Sarkar (an old name for Hazara). In the Durrani period (1740-1800), no attempt was made by Afghan rulers to subdue their territory. However, when the Sikhs captured lower Hazara they tried to gain control over entire lower Hazara including Karlal territory.\nIn 1822, Ranjit Singh sent a large force under famous General Amar Singh Majitta which was defeated by Karlals with great slaughter under their Charismatic chief Sarrdar Hassan Ali Khan . Amar Singh was also murdered by the Karlal s. Lepel Griffin, author of a colonial history of Hazara, writes in his book about this battle of Sumandar Khata. From 1822 to 1845 Karlal tribe fought many battles with Sikhs and were able to retain their independence. In 1844 once again Lahore Darbar sent a large force under Diwan Mulraj and Hari Singh to subdue Karlal country. Taking advantage of the difficult geographical terrain of their country, the Karlals were able to defeat Sikh army at place called Nah and killed more than 150 Sikh soldiers.\nAt the time of mutiny in 1857, the Karlals tried to revolt against the rule of East India Company, however, British were able to imprison Karlal chief Sardar Hassan Ali Khan Karlal and many mutineers of this tribe were hanged along with some Dhund tribesmen (Mutiny Reports 1857 of Hazara District).\nSardar Hassan Ali khan Karlal was one of the most illustrious military commander and mujahid of early 19th century from Hazara. His historic endeavors for the freedom and struggle against both Sikhs and English have been well preserved in the historical annals. English gazetteers of that era, Wajabul Arz of 1874 and Tarikh Hazara of that time contain detailed accounts of the bravery, courage and military stratagem of this great hero. Karlals were the only tribe which under the sagacious leader ship Sardar Hassan Hassan Ali khan were able to retain their independence by defeating the most powerful army in the entire Northern India at that time.\nRecent history.\nDuring Pakistan movement Karlal tribe wholeheartedly supported Muslim League. In 1944 elder of Karlal tribe Capt Sardar Muhammad Zain Khan Karlal joined Muslim league with other notables of this tribe.In same year he was nominated as member of All India Muslim League organizing Committee by Quaid -e Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.In 1946 elections he was elected as Member NWFP Legislative Assembly from the lone constituency of Abbottabad on All India Muslim League ticket in spite of the strong support of the congress by the more populous tribes of District Hazara. In struggle for Pakistan, Captain Sardar Zain Muhammad khan was able to motivate his entire tribe for cause of the creation of Pakistan. Captain Capt Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan Karlal also had the unique honor of representing entire Hazara District in the historic Delhi All India Muslim Parliamentarians convention held in April 1946 under the chairmanship of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah which finally voted for the partition of India and creation of Pakistan. \nIn the civil disobedience movement started by Muslim League in NWFP now Khyber Pukhtunkhaw against Congress government Capt Sardar Zain Muhammad khan along with many Karlal tribesmen was imprisoned in February 1947. After the creation of Pakistan Capt Sardar Zain Muhammad Khan also served as Parliamentary Secretary for Revenue in NWFP government."}

The Finke River passes nearby the town, but it is dry for most of the year, except during floods.\nThe town was called Finke until the 1980s. It began as a trading stop on the Central Australian Railway. Local Aborigines traded dingo scalps, artefacts and tools for European goods. In the 1950s and 1960s, White farmers set up cattle stations around the town. Most of the Europeans left Finke when the railway line was moved westwards in the late 1970s. This was done because the track was damaged during huge floods in 1973 and 1974, so it was moved away from the river. The Aboriginal people living in the town did not move, and the town came to be known as Aputula. The name comes from a place called Putula near the town, which used to be the site of a water soak. Putula is an Arrernte word.

A formyl group is a part of a molecule with the structure R-CHO. It is made of a carbon double bonded to oxygen. The carbon is also bonded to hydrogen and an R group. A side chain is the rest of the molecule.\nThe group without the side chain is called the aldehyde group or formyl group. Aldehydes are different from ketones because the formyl group is at the end of the molecule in an aldehyde. Ketones have the formyl group in the middle of the molecule. Aldehydes are common in organic chemistry. Many fragrances (smell producing compounds) are aldehydes. \nStructure and bonding.\nAldehydes have a carbon double bonded to an oxygen. Because of this, they are slightly polar. This causes aldehydes to have a number of properties. One of the most important of these is solubility in water.\nNomenclature.\nIUPAC names for aldehydes.\nThe common names for aldehydes are not always the official names. The IUPAC names are useful, however. IUPAC recommends the following nomenclature for aldehydes:\nEtymology.\nThe word \"aldehyde\" comes from Latin. It was shortened from \"alcohol dehydrogenatus\" (dehydrogenated alcohol). The word aldehyde was created by Justus von Liebig. In the past, aldehydes were sometimes named after the corresponding alcohols, for example, \"vinous aldehyde\" for acetaldehyde. (\"Vinous\" is from the Latin word for wine, which is the traditional source of ethanol.)\nThe term \"formyl group\" comes from the Latin or Italian word \"formica\" which means ant.\nPhysical properties and characterization.\nAldehydes have many different properties. These properties change a lot if the rest of the molecule changes. Smaller aldehydes are more soluble in water. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are completely soluble in water. Many aldehydes have strong smells. Aldehydes will break down in air.\nTwo of the most important aldehydes, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, tend to form long chains. This is called polymerization.\nNaturally occurring aldehydes.\nMany aldehydes are found in essential oils and are the reason for their smells. Cinnamaldehyde, cilantro, and vanillin all get their smells from aldehydes.\nCommon reactions.\nAldehydes are highly reactive and participate in many reactions.\" In industry, aldehydes are used to prepare plasticizers, polyols, and alcohols. In biology, aldehydes are used to replace amine groups and form sugars.\nDialdehydes.\nA dialdehyde is a molecule with two aldehydes. The names of dialdehydes have the ending -dial or -dialdehyde. Some dialdehydes are named after the acid that they are similar to. An example is butanedial, which is also called succinaldehyde (from succinic acid).\nUses.\nOf all aldehydes, formaldehyde is produced the most. About 6 million tons per year are made. It is mainly used to make resins when mixed with urea, melamine, and phenol. Bakelite is made like this. Another commonly made aldehyde is butyraldehyde. 2 and a half million tons per year are made. A lot of acetaldehyde once was once made, but much less is made today. This is because chemicals that used to be made from acetaldehyde are now made in other ways.\nOther websites.\nEntrancei https://www.entrancei.com/chapter-aldehydes-and-ketones/type-of-chemical-reactions-in-carbonyl-compounds"}

His sons, including Muhammad Hayat, were raised and educated by the British Indian officers like John Nicholson and James Abbott. \nHe was eventually selected to become Nicholson's orderly and Persian language interpreter.

Before dying, Nicholson recommended him to Sir John Lawrence, Chief Commissioner of the Punjab and later its first Governor. Muhammad Hayat was thus given a series of important civil appointments in the Punjab province by the grateful British, and after serving as an Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and then Sessions Judge, he eventually became the first Muslim native to be appointed as a member of the Punjab Legislative Council.\nIn 1899 he was given a CSI award and given the title of 'Nawab' in recognition of his long and meritorious services to the British Raj. He was also a close friend of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and a firm supporter of the Aligarh Movement for Muslim education, which resulted in the foundation of the MAO College (later Aligarh Muslim University) in India.\nDeath and legacy.\nHe died in December 1901, at his native village Wah, North Punjab, British India. Two of his sons, Sir Liaqat Hayat and Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan went on to be famous in their own right."}

It made landfall on the East Coast of the United States and Eastern Canada (Nova Scotia). Sandy was the eighteenth tropical cyclone, eighteenth named storm, and tenth hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22. It quickly got bigger and stronger after becoming a tropical depression. It was then upgraded to a tropical storm six hours later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the Greater Antilles and got stronger. On October 24, Sandy made landfall in Jamaica and was upgraded to a hurricane. Sandy made a second landfall in Cuba, where it became a Category 3 hurricane.\nAt least 43 people were killed: 40 in the Caribbean and three in the Bahamas. On October 25, Sandy got weaker and became a Category 1 hurricane. On October 27, Sandy became a tropical storm for a few hours. It then became a Category 1 hurricane again that morning. On October 26, Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray declared a state of emergency for the nation's capital. That same day the governors of Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia also declared a state of emergency. Landfall in New Jersey came on October 29. Damage was extensive there and in New York. It was the 2nd costliest hurricane behind Hurricane Katrina (2005), Hurricane Harvey (2017), Hurricane Maria (2017) and Hurricane Irma (2017).\nSandy's tracking history.\nOn October\u00a019, a tropical wave was moving westward through the eastern Caribbean Sea. It had an extended low pressure area. It was expected to become better organized. On October\u00a020, the system became better organized as expected. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that it had a high potential for it to become a tropical cyclone within 48 hours. The next day, thunderstorms were small. Although, barometric pressure in the area remained low. Because of this, the system had potential for development. The thunderstorms got bigger, while the system slowed and eventually stopped moving. At 1500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a022, the NHC gave out advisories on Tropical Depression Eighteen. The NHC reported that the storm was 320\u00a0mi (515\u00a0km) south of Kingston, Jamaica.\nWhen the tropical depression formed, it was in an area of weak steering currents. This was located south of a ridge extending eastward from the Gulf of Mexico. The system was in an area favorable for strengthening. Late on October\u00a022, a Hurricane Hunters flight found winds of in a rainband. This made NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Sandy. Because of the moist atmosphere, the storm got better organized. Early on October\u00a024, an eye began to develop. By that time, Sandy was moving slowly northward. At 11:00 am EDT (1500\u00a0UTC) on October\u00a024, the NHC upgraded Sandy to hurricane status. This was because the Hurricane Hunters found winds of . At the time, Sandy was located about south of Kingston, Jamaica.\nSandy made landfall near Kingston at 3:00 p.m EDT (1900\u00a0UTC) on October\u00a024. It had winds of about . Before making its second landfall, Sandy got stronger and became a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale with 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h). At 1:25 am EDT (0525\u00a0UTC), Sandy made landfall in Cuba just west of Santiago de Cuba. When it made landfall in Cuba, Sandy had a visible eye of over in diameter. At the time, winds reached 135\u00a0mph (216\u00a0km/h). While over land, the storm weakened and the eye was no longer visible. After Sandy left Cuba, dry air and increasing shear caused the storm to be disorganized. A mid-level low over Florida turned the hurricane toward the north-northwest. By early on October\u00a026, most of the storm was to the north of the center. This caused the storm to get larger. By the next day, the NHC reported that Sandy was starting to become more of a hybrid cyclone. On October\u00a027, Sandy weakened to a tropical storm. A few hours later, it got stronger and became a Category 1 hurricane again.\nPreparation.\nCaribbean.\nAfter Sandy developed into a tropical cyclone on October\u00a022, the Government of Jamaica issued a tropical storm watch. Early on October\u00a023, the watch became a tropical storm warning. That same day, a hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica. On that same day at 1500 UTC, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning.\nThe Government of Haiti issued a tropical storm watch for Haiti. By late October\u00a023, it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. There was a hurricane watch issued for the Cuban Provinces of Camag\u00fcey, Granma, Guant\u00e1namo, Holgu\u00edn, Las Tunas, and Santiago de Cuba at 1500\u00a0UTC on October\u00a023. Only three hours later, the hurricane watch was switched to a hurricane warning. Only three hours later, the hurricane watch was switched to a hurricane warning.\nThe Bahamas.\nThe Government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm watch for the Acklins, Cat Island, Crooked Island, Exuma, Inagua, Long Cay, Long Island, Mayaguana, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador Island.

It is a browser, with lips that help eating from low branches.\nThe other African rhinoceros is the white rhinoceros (\"Ceratotherium simum\"). The white rhinoceros is not white, but lighter coloured.\nRhinoceros and oxpeckers.\nThere is a type of bird called an oxpecker in English that likes to sit on the rhino's back and eat insects and other small animals that bite the rhino's skin. Because the birds also peck at the rhinos' skins with their beaks and hurt it, scientists wondered why the rhinos do not shake the birds off their backs. One team of scientists from California State University and Victoria University in Australia found that the black rhinoceros listens for the noises the oxpecker makes. Rhinoceros cannot see well but oxpeckers can. Oxpeckers make a noise when they see humans nearby that is different from their other noises. The rhinos hear this noise and then either look for the human or run away. The scientists performed an experiment: A human would slowly walk toward a rhino. Rhinos without oxpeckers on their backs only noticed the human one out of five times, but rhinos with oxpeckers noticed the human every time and from much further away. The scientists wondered if bringing flocks of oxpeckers to groups of rhinoceros without them would help the rhinos avoid human hunters.\nThe scientists had the idea for this experiment because the Swahili language word for oxpecker is \"Askari wa kifaru,\" which means \"the rhino's guard\" in English. One of the scientists said it was important to listen to indigenous peoples when studying things in the places where those people live. \"We too often dismiss the importance of indigenous people and their observations,\" said ecologist Roan Plotz, who worked on this study. \"While western science has been incredibly useful, there are many insights we can learn from indigenous communities.\"\nThreats.\nBlack rhinoceros is currently one of the endangered species and is on the verge of extinction in Africa.There has been approximately 96% decline in its population and one of the major causes for its extinction is habitat destruction and encroachment."}

In English language, it might be considered as a fallacy of relevance.\n\u201cTwo wrongs make a right\u201d.\n\u201cTwo wrongs make a right\u201d might be considered as a fallacy of relevance when assuming that, if one wrong is committed, then another wrong will cancel it out. \nThis phrase considers the two actions are wrong. for this reason it is not used by a wrongdoer which does not consider its action as wrong.\nThis phrase considers breaking the law (or the wrong) is justified, as long as the other party also does so. \nTwo wrongs do not make one right.\nTwo wrongs don't make a right is a proverb which means that a wrongful action is not a appropriate way to correct or cancel a previous wrongful action, in regard to a norm.\nAdditionally, it alleges the first action is also wrong.\nRelationship.\nWhen both actions are considered wrong, the two phrases might be opposed to each other.\nCriticism.\nCommon use of the term has been criticized by scholar Gregory S. Kavka writing in the \"Journal of Business Ethics\". Kavka refers back to philosophical concepts of retribution by Thomas Hobbes. He states that if something supposedly held up as a moral standard or common social rule is violated enough in society, then an individual or group within society can break that standard or rule as well since this keeps them from being unfairly disadvantaged. As well, in specific circumstances violations of social rules can be defensible if done as direct responses to other violations. For example, Kavka states that it is wrong to deprive someone of their property but it is right to take property back from a criminal who takes other's property in the first place. He also states that one should be careful not to use this ambiguity as an excuse to recklessly violate ethical rules.\nConservative journalist Victor Lasky wrote in his book \"It Didn't Start With Watergate\" that while \"two wrongs don't make a right\", if a set of immoral things are done and left un-prosecuted, this creates a legal precedent. Thus, people who do the same wrongs in the future should rationally expect to get away as well. Lasky analogizes the situation between John F. Kennedy's wiretapping of Martin Luther King, Jr. (which lead to nothing) and Richard Nixon's actions in Watergate (which Nixon thought would also lead to nothing).\nHistory.\nThe phrase \"two wrongs infer one right\" appears in a poem dated to 1734, published in \"The London Magazine\"."}
{"id": "367615", "revid": "518224", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367615", "title": "Siegfried Sassoon", "text": "Siegfried Sassoon (8 September 1886 - 1 September 1967) was an English poet and novelist, who became widely known as a result of a protest against the First World War that he made in 1917.\nBackground.\nSassoon's father, Alfred, came from a very rich family, but they did not approve of his marriage and as a result he did not inherit any of the family fortune. Sassoon's mother, Theresa, came from a family of artists. She and Alfred had three sons: Michael, Siegfried and Hamo, but Alfred left her when the children were still very young. Alfred himself died not long afterwards, leaving Theresa to bring up the three boys. Although they were not as wealthy as Alfred's family, they were able to live comfortably in a large house near the village of Matfield in Kent.\nEarly life.\nAs a young man, Siegfried could afford to keep a horse and became a very inspiring and a very good professional rider, but his greatest ambition was to be a millionaire poet person. He did not succeed in finding a publisher for any of his work until just before the First World War broke out. At that point, he joined the army. He chose the Sussex Yeomanry, in order that his horse could go with him rather than being taken by the authorities for other uses. As a result of a riding accident during training, he was out of action for a while, and he then decided to join an infantry regiment and become an officer. The regiment he joined was the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and he began with the rank of lieutenant.\nEventually Sassoon was sent out to France to fight on the Western Front and was shocked by his experiences there. He became friends with another poet, Robert Graves, who, although younger than Sassoon, had been at the Front for longer and had grown used to it. He suggested that Sassoon's poetry could be improved if he began to write in a more realistic way about the things he saw and experienced in France, and Sassoon took his advice and changed his style a lot.\nBy 1917, many of Sassoon's friends, and his brother, had been killed and he had become very angry about the war. As a result of several acts of bravery, he had been awarded the Military Cross, but he did not see this as a great honour. When he was sent home to recover from a wound, he met people who were opposed to the war, and, after listening to their arguments, he began to believe that the politicians were deliberately making the war last longer than it needed to, instead of taking opportunities to make peace with the Germans. He decided not to return to his regiment at the end of his leave, and, feeling very depressed, he tore the ribbon of his medal off his uniform and threw it in a river. He then wrote a letter to his commanding officer, explaining that he was not coming back because he wanted to protest about the war.\nWhen soldiers acted against orders like this, they were normally made to appear at a court-martial. However, because of Sassoon's good record as a soldier, he was given a chance to change his mind. His friend Robert Graves told the senior officers how depressed Sassoon was and said that he was too ill to fight. It was decided to send him to a hospital in Edinburgh, which specialised in dealing with officers who were suffering from mental illness. Sassoon did not like being there, because he felt that he was not really ill. He was greatly influenced by his doctor, W. H. R. Rivers, who became a kind of father figure to him. While he was a patient in Edinburgh, he met another young officer, called Wilfred Owen. Owen admired Sassoon's poetry and the two became close friends. Sassoon helped Owen to write better poetry; this is known because the manuscript of one of Owen's greatest poems, \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", still exists showing corrections in Sassoon's writing. Sassoon and Owen were separated after a few months, when Sassoon came to the end of his time at the hospital and agreed to go back to his regiment.\nSassoon was not sent back to France immediately, but fought for a few months in Palestine, where the troops were in less danger of being killed. After that, he returned to France, but after only a short time he was wounded again, and this time it was serious enough to stop him from being sent back. He stayed in touch with Wilfred Owen. While Sassoon was away fighting, Owen had also been released from hospital, and was being sent back to his regiment in France. Several days before the end of the war, Owen was killed.\nDuring the war, Sassoon's poetry had become very successful. After the war, however, he went through a period of great unhappiness. His friend Rivers died suddenly, and he felt he had nothing left to write about. He realised that he was homosexual, but he was unable to find a partner he could rely on. He thought of becoming a politician, but began writing for the newspapers instead. After a few years, a friend suggested that he should write about his experiences in a novel. Sassoon did so, writing about his early life and calling the book \"Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man\" (1928). He published the book anonymously, because he was well known as a poet and had doubts about his ability to write prose. To disguise his identity, he called the hero \"George Sherston\", but the character was based on Sassoon himself. The book turned out to be a huge success, and Sassoon wrote two sequels to it. He later wrote three more prose books about his life, this time without disguising any of the characters, and these were also very successful.\nLater life.\nAt the age of 47, after several homosexual love affairs, Sassoon married. His wife, Hester, was much younger than him, but Sassoon was desperate to become a father. They moved into Heytesbury House in Wiltshire, a large house that he had bought with money inherited from his aunt, Rachel Beer. Two years after their marriage, Hester became pregnant with their son George (1936-2006). Hester did not want to have any more children, and this became the cause of many quarrels between the couple, until, after the Second World War, they agreed to divorce, and Hester went to live in Scotland, taking George with her. Siegfried continued to see his son, but he was unable have the close relationship with George that he would have liked.\nHe continued to be a respected writer until his death, and had many friends in the world of literature, including another poet, Edmund Blunden, whom he had met during the 1920s. In 1951, he was awarded the CBE and in 1957 the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry.\nSassoon had been brought up by his mother in the Church of England, although his father was Jewish. His war experiences made him doubt the existence of God, and he was not interested in religion until towards the end of his life. In 1957, after much heart-searching, he became a Roman Catholic, and remained so until his death at the age of eighty. He was buried in the churchyard at Mells in Somerset."}

He became notable during the 1980s for introducing a unique style of music, mixing aboriginal music with reggae and rock music. Willoughby is often seen as a pioneer for modern indigenous musicians in Australia. He was the first Aborigine to sign a record contract and the first to compose the music for a movie. His band No Fixed Address was the first indigenous band to tour overseas.\nSince then, Willoughby has performed with many famous musicians and bands, including Midnight Oil, Cold Chisel, Peter Tosh, Shane Howard and Yothu Yindi. Willoughby is now known as one of Australia's leading Aboriginal rock composers and performers. His song \"We Have Survived\", composed when he was 18, is often seen as a kind of anthem by indigenous Australians. Others of his more well known songs include \"Black Man's Rights\", \"Aboriginal Woman\" and \"My Father is an Aboriginal Man\".\nChildhood.\nWilloughby was born in 1960 in South Australia. His father was Kokatha, with relations to the Pitjantjatjara and Warlpiri nations; and his mother was a member of the Mirning people, from the Nullabor Plain. Willoughby grew up at Koonibba, which was a Lutheran mission at the time. When he was 15 years old, he began learning at the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music at the University of Adelaide. Here he was introduced to drumming, guitars and Western music. Over the next few years there, he developed an unusual style of music by mixing traditional indigenous music with modern Western music styles, particularly reggae.\nCareer.\nNo Fixed Address.\nIn 1978, Willoughby formed his first band, No Fixed Address. This was Australia's first indigenous rock band. The band played its first big concert in 1979, and held several gigs over the next few years. They mostly played at concerts that promoted political and social causes. The band signed a recording contract in 1982, with Rough Diamond Records. It was the first record deal with an Aboriginal musical act in Australia. The deal produced the band's first extended play, \"From My Eyes\", which began with the song \"We Have Survived\". Its sale was launched in Sydney by the Prime Minister Bob Hawke.\nLater in the year, Willoughby and his band toured Australia as the opening act for Peter Tosh. Willoughby also played drums with Shane Howard and Goanna during their own tours of the country. The success from Tosh's tour led the Aboriginal Arts Board to give No Fixed Address a grant, to be used for a tour of their own overseas. The band toured England, in 1984. It was the first Aboriginal band to travel and play overseas. They played in nine cities, including London, Bristol, Leeds, Plymouth and Manchester. They also played at the Elephant Fayre festival in Saint Germans, Cornwall, and at a benefit concert for the miners' strikes.\nAfter coming back to Australia, Willoughby joined his cousin's new band Coloured Stone. He played with this group from 1984, including during its tour of Scotland in 1986. They played at that year's Edinburgh Festival. They returned to Australia for the Australian Music Awards at the end of the year, and won the Best Indigenous Album award for \"Human Love\".\nWilloughby reformed No Fixed Address in 1987, and the band toured Europe during 1987\u20131988.\nMixed Relations.\nLate in 1988, Willoughby was asked to join the newly formed Yothu Yindi as drummer on their tour for the album \"Diesel &amp; Dust\". The tour visited 73 cities in the United States. Willoughby left Yothu Yindi in 1989 after the tour, and formed a new band Mixed Relations. This is the band he currently plays with. They have toured many Aboriginal communities and Australian cities, as well as several countries in the Pacific Islands.\nIn 1989, the band performed as the closing act for the very first Invasion Day (an alternative to Australia Day) concert at La Perouse in Sydney. They returned every year after that until the concerts stopped in 1994. They also represented Australia at the South Pacific Music Festival in 1990 and 1992, and at the Asian Music Festival in 1990 and 1992.\nFilm and television.\nIn 1980, Willoughby starred with another indigenous band (Us Mob) in a movie called \"Wrong Side of the Road\". It was a biographical drama movie about racism against Aboriginal musicians in rural towns. The movie won an award from the Australian Film Institute (AFI) in 1981. In 1990, Willoughby was cast in a small role in \"Until the End of the World\". The movie starred William Hurt and Sam Neill, as well as indigenous actors Ernie Dingo, David Gulpilil and Jimmy Little.\nWilloughby also composed and recorded the soundtracks for several movies (mostly documentaries). These were done with No Fixed Address, and included \"Always Was, Always Will Be\" in 1988 and \"Special Treatment: Locking up Aboriginal Children\" in 1991. In 1992, he became the first Aboriginal to compose, play and direct the music track of a feature film. The movie was \"Jindalee Lady\", directed by Brian Syron. The movie was shown as part of the International First Nations Art and Film Festival in Edmonton, Canada, and the Hawaii International Film Festival.\nLater years.\nWilloughby was given the very first Indigenous Australian Music Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993 for his contribution to the growth of indigenous music in Australia. Sol Bellear, Commissioner of the Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) said that Willoughby had been an \"innovator\" for indigenous musicians in Australia:\nIn the same year, Willoughby began teaching music to children at a Pitjantjatjara school in Yalata.\nIn 1997, Willoughby signed a contract as a solo artist with CAAMA Music. His first album was \"Pathways\". It was nominated for an award by the Australian Performing Rights Association (APRA). In 2011, both No Fixed Address and Coloured Stone were put in the National Indigenous Music Awards Hall of Fame."}

Some other carnivorous plants, such as the bladderworts, also have a rapid response to insects.\nThe Dogwood Bunchberry, \"Cornus canadensis\", has a flower which opens its petals and fires pollen in less than 0.5 milliseconds. The record is currently held by the White Mulberry tree, \"Morus alba\", whose leaves are used to cultivate silkworms. It is also notable for the rapid release of its pollen, which is launched at over half the speed of sound. The stamens act as catapults, releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 \u00b5s. \"This is the fastest motion yet observed in biology, and approaches the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants\".\nThe very widespread genus \"Impatiens\" gets its common name, \"touch-me-not\", from its seed capsules. When the capsules mature, they \"explode\" when touched, shooting seeds several metres away.\nA comparatively slow-moving plant is \"Mimosa pudica\", which closes its leaflets in a graceful sequence.\nThese rapid plant movements contrast with the more common, and much slower \"growth-movements\" of plants. They are called \"tropisms\". \nCharles Darwin in 1880 published his last work before his death, \"The Power of Movement in Plants\"."}

It belongs to the Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra peoples (or A\u1e49angu). Native title was granted by the government of David Tonkin on 30 October 1981. The land covers about , about 10.4% of the state. It is one of the 74 local government areas of South Australia.\nThe APY lands are arid and very remote. It is mostly flat, except for the Everard Ranges in the east and Musgrave Ranges along the border with the Northern Territory. There are about 2500 people living on the lands.\nHistory.\nThe area covered by APY represents the southern portion of the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara homelands; the northern portion is in the Northern Territory, surrounding Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park. In 1921, the western half of what is now the APY lands was made into the North-West Aboriginal Reserve. This was alongside another reserve across the border in the Northern Territory, called the Petermann Reserve. Both reserves were intended to form a temporary refuge (safe place) for Aboriginal people. The government said they could continue their nomadic lifestyle there until they could be assimilated into modern society. The eastern half of what is now the APY lands was part of the Woomera Test Range during the 1950s and 1960s. The boundary of the range was later moved further south, and the land was then leased to cattle farmers.\nIn 1966, South Australia passed the Aboriginal Lands Trust Act. It was the first piece of legislation (law) in Australia to recognise Aboriginal land rights and allow for Aboriginal groups to be given land based on how they had lived there. No other state or territory would enact anything like it until 10 years later. In 1976, the Pitjantjatjara Council made an formal claim to the lands around the Musgrave Ranges. It was done on behalf of all A\u1e49angu with historical connections to the area. Premier Don Dunstan and his government proposed a bill to parliament in 1978, intending to grant the Pitjantjatjara rights to their land. However, opal miners strongly objected to the proposal. They had set up mining camps at Mintabie, within the area that would be given to the A\u1e49angu. The government changed after state elections in 1979. The new government of David Tonkin had years of negotiations with the Pitjantjatjara Council and the miners at Mintabie. A parliamentary committee produced a final decision on 2 March 1981. It said that the Mintabie area should be included in the grant of land, but be leased back to the government so that mining can continue there. The bill was approved by parliament on the same day.\nTonkin signed the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act on 2 October 1981, putting the bill into effect. The freehold title to the land was given to the Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra peoples, who formed a council as the local government. The grant included the former leasehold areas in the eastern portion: Everard Park, Kenmore Park and Granite Downs. A portion of the southeast of the APY lands (about ) still overlaps with the Woomera Test Range.\nThe lease for Mintabie lasted for 21 years, expiring in 2002. New legislation in 2009 allowed for another lease, which was signed in April 2012.\nPopulation.\nThe APY is one of 74 local government areas of South Australia. It includes a number of settlement communities, as well as over 50 family outstations (referred to as \"homelands\"). Most of the settlements are located in the far north. The administrative centre for the APY is Umuwa. The four largest towns, as recorded in the 2006 census are Iwantja (339 people), Pukatja (332), Amata (319) and Mimili (303). The only non-indigenous community is the opal-mining town of Mintabie (250 people). The other settlement communities are: Kaltjiti, Watarru, Kanpi, Nyapari, Kalka, Pipalyatjara, Yunyarinyi and Watinuma.\nIn the 2006 census, there were 2,230 people living on the APY Lands. About 84.5% of them were Indigenous Australians. Over half (58.6%) of residents listed Pitjantjatjara as the language spoken at home; 14.3% listed Yankunytjatjara; and 18.7% gave English as their spoken language.\nDevelopment.\nThere has not been much economic development, except for tourism. There have been proposals to mine in the area. The Musgrave Ranges is estimated to contain rich mineral and petroleum deposits. The APY government has not allowed mining so far, because it is concerned about the social impacts it may have, and the possible impacts on sacred sites and the environment.\nSocial issues.\nTwo major issues throughout the APY Lands are the low standard of health care (compared to the rest of Australia) and drug abuse (usually alcohol, petrol sniffing, cannabis and, more recently, other illegal drugs). The fact that the indigenous area crosses over three jurisdictions (South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory) has made enforcing drug-trafficking laws difficult. An inquiry into child sexual abuse on the APY Lands was done by a retired Supreme Court judge. It was completed in 2008, and found that this had been a widespread problem in several of the APY communities for many years.\nIn early August 2007, the South Australian government announced a A$34 million plan to \"improve well-being of Aboriginal people\" in the APY Lands. $25m will be spent on improving housing and most of the remaining $8m on law enforcement in Amata and Pukatja."}

It does not fly north for winter or south for summer. It is the tallest bird in the world that can fly. (Ostriches are taller, but they do not fly.) It can grow to 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) tall. Its wing can reach 2.4 metres (8 ft) from tip to tip. It can weigh 8.4 kg (18.5 lb). It lives in open wetlands.\nAppearance and habitat.\nIt is easy to tell the sarus crane apart from other cranes that live in the same places. The sarus crane is grey in colour with a red head and part of the neck. The sarus crane looks for food in marshes and shallow wetlands. It eats roots, tubers, insects, crustaceans, and small vertebrate prey. Like other cranes, the sarus crane forms long-lasting pairs and holds territories. There they perform territorial and courtship displays which include loud trumpeting, leaps and dance-like movements.\nIt lives in wetlands, and in agricultural lands close to humans. Elsewhere, the species has been eliminated in many parts of its former range.\nThe main breeding season is during the rainy season, when the pair builds an enormous nest \"island\", a circular platform of reeds and grasses nearly two metres in diameter and high enough to stay above the water. \nThreats.\nThere are fewer sarus cranes than there were a hundred years ago. The cranes alive today are perhaps 2.5% of the numbers that existed in the 1850s. The stronghold of the species is Rajasthan, India. The people in Rajasthan have traditions saying it is a very good bird.\nTradition.\nPeople in India use the sarus crane as a symbol of faithfulness. This is because Indian tradition says the cranes mate for life and that, when a crane's mate dies, it will become very sad or even starve itself to death."}

It also lives on treeless moors, on bogs, or on dwarf heather habitats, usually where small lakes or pools are also found. \nIn Sweden, breeders are usually found in small, swampy openings amongst pine forests while, in Germany, marshy wetlands are used. Breeding habitats in Russia are similar, though they can even be found nesting in the steppe and in semi-desert, so long as water is near. Mostly, common cranes are found breeding in wooded swamps, bogs and wetlands. They seem to need quiet, peaceful enivrons with little human interference. They live in low density, from 1 to 5 pairs per .\nDuring winter, the birds move to flooded areas, shallow sheltered bays, and swampy meadows. During the flightless moulting period there is a need for shallow waters or high reed cover for concealment. Later, after the migration period, the birds winter regularly in open country, often on cultivated lands and sometimes also in savanna-like areas, for example on the Iberian Peninsula.\nBack to Britain.\nCranes are back in Britain after 300 years. They were devastated by the draining of the fens 300 years ago. This was a low-lying wetland which was one of their favourite habitats."}

He was always known as Andr\u00e9s Segovia. \nHe was one of the best known and most influential classical guitar personalities of the 20th century. He had a big influence on later guitarists, because of his performances and recordings, and his masterclasses. Important guitar works were dedicated to him by composers such as Federico Moreno Torroba.\nSegovia led the development of the Spanish guitar as an instrument for classical art music. As well as works dedicated to him by modern composers, he also transcribed classical works originally written for other instruments. He is remembered for his expressive performances: his wide palette of tone, and his distinctive (often instantly recognizable) musical personality in tone, phrasing and style. \nSegovia was especially fond of the compositions of the Brazilian musician Villa-Lobos. In the 1920s, Segovia met Villa-Lobos and commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded with a set of twelve, each taking a tiny detail or figure from Brazilian chor\u00f5es (itinerant street musicians). \nTwo films were made of his life and work. They are available on DVD called \"Andr\u00e9s Segovia in Portrait\".

He studied there as well as in Berlin, Paris and Heidelberg. In Budapest, at the University of Budapest, he earned a doctorate in philosophy. In 1914 he attended lectures by Georg Simmel. During the brief period of the Hungarian Soviet in 1919 he taught in a teacher-training school thanks to the patronage and his friend and mentor Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs.\nLegacy.\nMannheim's book \"Ideologie und Utopie\" (1929) was the most widely debated book by a living sociologist in Germany during the Weimar Republic; the English version \"Ideology and Utopia\" (1936) has been a standard in American-style international academic sociology, carried by the interest it aroused in the U.S.A. The German and English versions of the book are quite different. This has led to reappraisals of Mannheim started by new texual discoveries and republications. Mannheim's sociological theorizing has been the subject of many book-length studies, evidence of an international interest in his principal themes. Mannheim was not an author of any work he himself considered a finished book, but rather of some fifty major essays and treatises. Most of these were later published in book form."}

Ama\u1e6fa was established under the name of Musgrave Park in 1961. The community was set up to take the pressure off the growth of nearby Pukatja (then known as Ernabella). The goal was to use it to teach the Aborigines in how to work in the livestock industry. A school was opened 7 years later, in 1968.\nAbout 319 people lived at Ama\u1e6fa in the 2006 census. It appears to have a growing population, which is not the usual pattern for Aboriginal communities in Australia. From 180 residents in 1981, it has grown steadily past 350 in the 1990s, to 536 in 1996.\nAma\u1e6fa is made up of about 60 houses. There is a school, a general store and a health clinic. Supplies are delivered once per week and mail is delivered twice per week. Water comes from bores and is stored in tanks. The school was renovated by the state government from 2003\u20132005. A swimming pool was opened in June 2007. Ama\u1e6fa also has a community centre, a community church, and an airstrip.\nThere is a police station at Ama\u1e6fa, but they are not always there; state police are based in Marla and run patrols to the area. Some night patrols by residents have been done in the past to help policing of the community. In the absence of police, the community is served by 2 community constables. Tony Abbott suggested in 2007 there should be police at Ama\u1e6fa permanently. In response, the state government said it would spend A$7.5 million at Ama\u1e6fa and Pukatja for new police stations, court facilities and prison cells. It would also provide housing for police officers.\nThe sale of local artwork is important to the economy of the Ama\u1e6fa community. Tjala Arts, founded in 1999, displayed the works of seven Ama\u1e6fa artists in Canberra in 2006.

There were 332 people living at Pukatja in the 2006 census. This was an increase from 226 in the 2001 census, but a decrease from 470 in the 1991 census.\nThe town was established as a Presbyterian mission in 1938, with the name Ernabella. Families gradually came in from traditional nomadic life in the desert to live at the mission. The church gave control over the Ernabella Mission to a local community council on 1 January 1974.\nMail is delivered twice a week by a small plane from Alice Springs. The community store sells food and clothes. The garage has basic parts and diesel fuel. The local clinic has three registered nurses and the doctor is based here, but often away visiting other communities in the APY. The community church belongs to the Uniting Church. There is a basic police station at Pukatja, and is not permanently manned. In July 2007, the state police described the station as \"dirty\" and not well equipped. In response, the state government said that it would spend A$7.5 million at Pukatja and nearby Amata for new police stations, court facilities, prisoner cells and housing for police officers.\nIn the 2001 census, Pukatja was second only to nearby Mimili in having the lowest per-person income in South Australia ($174). Most important to the community's income is the local artists' co-operative, Ernabella Arts Inc. Established in 1948, Ernabella Arts is one of the longest continually running aboriginal arts centres in Australia. During the 1950s and 1960s, art and craft using local wool was the typical artistic form made by the Ernabella artists. Batik was introduced after several Ernabella artists travelled to Indonesia in the 1970s. Ernabella artists are now well known for their batik work and printmaking. A large collection of Ernabella art can be seen at the National Museum of Australia."}

Elements other than oxygen are used for electron transport. Common replacements for oxygen are nitrates, iron, manganese, sulfates, sulfur, fumaric acid and carbon dioxide. \"Escherichia coli\" uses nitrates and fumaric acid for respiration.\nFor the electron transport chain to work, there must be a final electron acceptor at the end of the chain. This allows electrons to pass through the chain. In aerobic organisms, this final electron acceptor is oxygen. Molecular oxygen is a highly oxidizing agent and so it is an excellent acceptor. In anaerobes, other less-oxidizing substances such as sulphate (SO42\u2212), nitrate (NO3\u2212), sulphur (S) are used. These terminal electron acceptors have smaller reduction potentials than O2, so less energy is released per oxidized molecule. Anaerobic respiration is therefore less efficient than aerobic respiration except, of course, when oxygen is scarce.\nIf oxygen is not used at all, the process is called fermentation. Examples of organisms using fermentation are lactic acid bacteria, and yeast. Yeast is a fungi, not bacteria.\nThe equation for anaerobic respiration is:"}

The creek is usually a dry sandy bed and only flows at times of very high rainfall.

He wrote that he found 200 male Aborigines there in September 1873, during his second trip into the South Australian desert. The meeting was violent, as Giles and his travellers interrupted a sacred ceremony. The first European settlement near Kaltjiti was set up in 1934. It was established by a dogger (dingo hunter), who was given the rights to the nearby bore (called Shirley Well) by the government as a reward for all the dingos he had killed. By the late 1950s, Aboriginal families were camped at Shirley Well permanently. In 1960, the station at Ernabella was expanded to include Shirley Well.\nA outstation, called Fregon, was built with government help by 1961, as a base for Aboriginal stockmen and their families. It was built south of Shirley Well on Officer Creek. The aim of the settlement was to provide training in working with livestock and for the families to have access to traditional country in the sandhills to the west. Fregon was administered through Ernabella and it was not until 1968 that it had its own airstrip. It began with a school, a small health clinic, a workshop, a small store and houses for the staff.\nMail is delivered to Kaltjiti twice a week. Supplies are delivered every two weeks.

Lloyd Morgan", "text": "Conwy Lloyd Morgan, FRS, usually known as Lloyd Morgan, (6 February 1852 \u2013 6 March 1936) was a British ethologist and psychologist. He is best remembered for the experimental approach to animal psychology now known as 'Morgan's canon', which is a specialised form of Occam's razor. His idea played a role in the later growth of behaviourism in psychology.\nLife.\nLloyd Morgan was born in London and studied at the Royal School of Mines and under T.H. Huxley. He taught in Cape Town, but in 1884 joined the staff of University College, Bristol as Professor of Geology and Zoology. He quickly became interested in the field he called 'mental evolution', the borderland between intelligence and instinct. In 1901 he became the college's first Professor of Psychology and Education.\nIn 1909 Lloyd Morgan became the first Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University. He held the office for a year, then was Professor of Psychology and Ethics until his retirement in 1919.\nEthology.\nUnder Lloyd's canon, animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way. For example, an animal should be considered conscious only if there is no other explanation for its behaviour. Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial and error learning. An example is the skilful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.\nW.H. Thorpe commented as follows:\nThis kind of study throws light not only on inherited behaviour but on the maturation of sense organs and the central nervous system. Behaviour changes in most animals during the first hours and days of life. The causes of those changes in behaviour may be developmental maturation, or learning, or some combination of the two. This is a primary area of research in ethology."}

It is located about south of the Northern Territory border at the base of the Mann Ranges. The nearby town of Nyapa\u1e5fi is to the east.\nKa\u1e49pi is part of the Murputja Homelands, which also includes the family outstations Angatja and Umpukulu. The residents are mostly Pitjantjatjara people with their traditional country nearby. The settlement started as an outstation for the Baker family, who moved here from other parts on the APY lands to be closer to the country of their ancestors.\nBecause both Ka\u1e49pi and nearby Nyapa\u1e5fi are small communities, there are only basic services and most of them are shared between the two towns. In Ka\u1e49pi there is a work shop, a garage, a day care centre and an art centre. It also has a community store, built in 1996, which has a pump for petrol. Food and supplies are delivered once every two weeks. The store services both Ka\u1e49pi and Nyapa\u1e5fi, as well as nearby outstations. Local health services are based at the clinic in Nyapa\u1e5fi. Both Ka\u1e49pi and Nyapa\u1e5fi had their own schools from 1987, but these joined together in 1993. The new school, Murputja Education Centre, was built between the two communities, east of Ka\u1e49pi and 6\u00a0km west of Nyapa\u1e5fi."}
