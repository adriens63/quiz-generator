Anxiety is one of the most common symptoms and can lead the person to believe that if a task is not completed, something bad will happen. Such a task may be washing hands many times, keeping the lights on or even keeping their surrounding clean. This belief leads to more anxiety and tension. The actions that someone takes to stop the thoughts and feelings can take more than an hour every day.\u00a0OCD can limit one's ability to take part in relationships, the workplace, and in society in general. OCD affects around 1.2% of the world's population, and it affects the lives of around 15%. In the United States, about one in fifty adults has OCD.\nSymptoms.\nObsessions.\nSomeone with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder has intrusive (unwanted) thoughts called obsessions. An unwanted thought is an obsession that will happen many times and is a thought that the person does not want to have. It is normal to have obsessions, but what changes is how people react to the thoughts. People who do not have OCD are able to ignore bad thoughts and move on, and/or such thoughts do not cause them much distress or anxiety. People who have OCD find it very hard to try and ignore these thoughts. However, just because someone has intrusive (unwanted) thoughts does not always mean they have OCD, but it could mean they have something else. Other brain-based disorders that could result in intrusive thoughts include include Bipolar disorder, Depression, Body dysmorphic disorder, and sometimes Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \nDifferent people will have different obsessive thoughts. Some people have obsessions about God, the Devil, or another religious figure hurting them or someone they love. Other people have obsessions about sex. They may think about things like kissing, having sex with, or touching people around them. People with OCD may worry that they will act on these thoughts.\nSome people have obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder without compulsions. This is called \"primarily obsessional OCD\", or \"pure-O\". It is thought that up to half of all people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder have primarily obsessional OCD. People with primarily obsessional OCD may have a third type of obsession; that is aggressive thoughts. People with aggressive thoughts may have obsessions about hurting or killing themselves or people around them. Instead of performing compulsions, people with primarily obsessional OCD may act out compulsions in their mind or avoid the things and places that cause the obsessions.\nCompulsions.\nMany people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder act in a certain way to stop the obsessive thought. These specific actions are known as compulsions. To someone with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, doing these compulsions are a way to stop the obsessive thought. They may also think that doing the compulsion will stop something bad from happening to them or someone they care about. \nMany compulsions are similar to body tics, and up to 40% of people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder have a tic disorder. Some examples of compulsion include:\nMany people mistakenly think OCD is only about organizing or cleaning, but it is more than just those two. For example, someone who has excessive fear of disappointing God, fear they will go to Hell upon death, or committing sins is scrupulous, which is OCD based on religion. Compulsions of someone who is scrupulous includes excessive praying, excessive trips to their church, asking their priest the same question if what they did is a sin even though they've been told it's not, etc.\nPeople with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder usually know that their compulsions do not make sense, but do them anyways to stop the feelings of panic or anxiety. People with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder may do their compulsions for hours every day. Their compulsions can also hurt them, such as compulsive hand washing making their hands red and cut.\nCauses.\nThe cause of obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder is unknown. There is evidence that genes have a strong role in developing the disorder. If the disorder starts in childhood, it is more likely that other family members will have OCD than if the disorder starts in adulthood. It is thought that obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder is the result of things humans did when they were evolving.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are four DSM diagnostic criteria for obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder:\nDifferential diagnosis.\nThere is another mental disorder similar to obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder called Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. The difference between the two is that people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder know that something is wrong and become stressed because of their obsessive thoughts. People with obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder do not know that something is wrong, and they like their obsessions and compulsions.\nManagement.\nTherapy.\nBehavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are used to help people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. The therapy works by making people be in places where they have their obsessive thoughts. They are then made to not do their compulsion. Over time, the person becomes used to the place or things that causes them to have their obsessive thoughts. An example of this is someone who is afraid of dirt having dirt put on their hands without being able to wash it off.\nMedication.\nThe medicines that are usually used are called \"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\", or SSRIs. These medicines work by stopping a chemical in the brain called serotonin from working. This causes the obsessive thoughts to happen less. In adults, SSRIs are used for people with moderate or severe issues. In children, SSRIs are used after or with therapy for people with severe issues.\nIf SSRIs do not work, it is possible for a doctor to give someone with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder anti-psychotic medicines. Doctors may use both medication and counseling for those with the disorder, and they find that this approach works best.\nProcedures.\nSurgery can be used to help people if other treatments do not work. In the United States, surgery is not done unless medicine and therapy have not worked multiple times. In the United Kingdom, surgery cannot be done unless cognitive behavioral therapy has not worked.\nChildren.\nTherapy can be used to reduce the compulsions in children and young adults. Family involvement is very important in treating children. Family also can give the child positive reinforcement for not doing their compulsive behaviors.\nHistory.\nIn Europe from the 14th to 16th centuries, it was thought that people who had obsessive thoughts were possessed. They would treat these people by performing sometimes dangerous exorcisms to remove the Devil or evil spirit from the person. In the 1910s, a doctor named Sigmund Freud said that obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder was because of fighting in someone's head. He said that these fights start in childhood when someone gains a \"touching phobia\", which fights with the natural want to touch things.\nSociety and culture.\nThere are several movies and television shows that show people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. The movie \"The Aviator\" shows the life of Howard Hughes. Hughes was afraid of germs, and his obsessions and compulsions were about keeping germs away. English footballer David Beckham has talked about his obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Television hosts Howie Mandel and Marc Summers have also talked about their obsessions and compulsions."}

This meant that instead of things being hand made in small workshops, they were made more cheaply in large quantities by machines in factories. Products being made in large quantity now meant that they were sold for less. It also led to rise in the rate of population growth. It is usually thought as starting in the 1760s. \nMany people began to move from an agricultural based life in the country to the towns where the factories offered more and better paid work. A Second Industrial Revolution began in the 1870s.\nBeginnings.\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the 18th century. Many of the technological innovations were of British origin. In particular, the County of Shropshire was important, for it had both minerals (e.g. iron ore and coal) and transport on the River Severn. This led to the group of industries near the Ironbridge Gorge and the town of Coalbrookdale.\nIn the mid-18th century Britain was the world's leading trading nation. It controlled a global trading empire with colonies in North America and Africa, and with some political influence on the Indian subcontinent, through the activities of the East India Company. The development of trade and the rise of business were major causes of the Industrial Revolution.\nThe Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history. Almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. Average income increased, and population grew rapidly. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, but others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.\nThe revolution spread to Europe and the Americas, especially the United States, by the early 19th century. Samuel Slater, who had been an apprentice in an English cotton factory, disguised himself and came to America. He reconstructed a spinning machine from memory and built a factory of his own. \nNew ideas and inventions were also taken up and used in mining, the working of metals, and in the transport of goods. Around the same time new ideas in farming were leaving some farm workers without jobs. They added to the move to the industrial towns where they sought out work in factories. \nThe most important new invention of the industrial revolution was the steam engine. The steam engine, improved by James Watt around 1776, was used to power the factories and pump out the deeper mines. It was also used in railway engines. The heat from burning coal became the main source of power.\nProblems.\nLiving standards rose and people generally became richer and healthier and had more children who survived to be adults instead of starving. The resulting population growth in England caused new problems. Where only a few people had been rich because they owned land, now more became very rich thanks to industry. More, however, were still poor and lived in poor conditions. Children and women had to work for a long time for little pay. Often several families crowded into very small apartments. Working at different times, family members would take turns sleeping when they were not working. Families were usually unable to get together. 12, 14, or even 18-hour workdays were common. The Industrial Revolution brought problems of its own.\nAdvancements.\nDuring the industrial revolution, new technology brought many changes. For example:"}

The capital of Botswana is Gaborone.\nHistory.\nThe first people in Botswana's territory were the Khoe and San people. Botswana was first formed as the Bechuanaland Protectorate by the British Empire in 1885.\nGeography.\nThe countries that border Botswana are Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Namibia. It is also possible to travel from Botswana directly into Zambia by crossing the Zambezi River by ferry.\nBotswana is landlocked. All of Botswana's trade must be brought in over land or by airplane.\nThe two most important geographical features in Botswana are the Okavango Delta and the Kalahari Desert.\nDivisions.\nBotswana is divided into 10 districts:\nCulture.\nPeople from Botswana are called \"Batswana\". The population of Botswana is about 2.2 million. This is only 2.7 persons per km\u00b2, a small number for a country of this size. This is because most of the country is desert and very dry.\nBotswana has two official languages: Setswana and English. Setswana is the national language (also called \"Tswana\").\nGovernance.\nBotswana is a democracy. The people vote for their political leaders. Those leaders vote for the president. In 2008 Ian Khama became the fourth president of Botswana. \nPresident Khama won elections in 2009 and 2014. The current President of Botswana is Dr. Eric K. Mokgweetsi who took over from Dr. Ian Khama Seretse Khama in 2018.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Botswana has been growing very fast since it became an independent country in 1966. The people of Botswana have had the world's fastest growth in standard of living since that time.\nBotswana's economy comes mostly from mining. This includes diamonds, metals (including copper) and minerals (including salt). Botswana is the highest producer of diamonds by value in the world. In 1999, Botswana produced over 30 million carats (6,000 kg) of diamonds from the three Debswana mines. That is about 25% of worldwide production.\nTourism is also important to the country. Many people come to Botswana each year to see its wildlife.\nThe currency of Botswana is called the \"pula\" (which means rain). It is made up of 100 \"thebe\" (which means shield). In 2017, one US dollar was about 10.32 pulas.\nIn popular culture.\nThe \"No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\" books by Alexander McCall Smith are set in Botswana. The HBO television series based on the books was filmed in Botswana."}

Some of these places can only be reached by ferry, because they have no roads or railways with bridge or tunnels that join them to nearby places, nor do they have any locations at which to land airplanes, whether it is an airport or only an airfield.\nSometimes the trip in a ferry is free and sometimes it must be paid for. Many ferries also carry cars, some even have own rail tracks, allowing the ferry to carry trains on board.\nThe word 'ferry' can also mean 'to take someone or something by ferry'.\nThe Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, in which 193 people died near Zeebrugge in 1987, was one of the worst ferry accidents of recent times. It was caused by a crew member forgetting to close the bow doors of the ferry."}

It is sometimes called Rapa Iti to distinguish it from Rapa Nui (Easter Island).\nHistory.\nThe first European, who visited the island, was the captain George Vancouver. He visited the island in 1791. The island had an estimated population of about 2000 inhabitants. Four tribes inhabited the island. There were many tribal wars on the island. \nThe Rapan people were converted to Christianity in 1826, when six embassadors were sent from Tahiti. Soon after that some slaves were brought to Rapa. It caused an epidemy and in 1867 the island's population had declined to about 120. Since late 1800s, the island's population has steadily grown. \nGeography.\nThe main village of Rapa is Haurei. Nearly all inhabitants of Rapa are living in Haurei. The Bay of Haurei, which is on the western end of the island, is named after the village. The bay's original name was, however, \"Oparo\" or \"Paro\". Smaller villages include 'Area. \nRapa's nearest inhabited neighbor island is more than five hundred kilometers away. Together with Marotiri and some smaller islets, Rapa forms the Bass Islands. Marotiri is 46 miles away from Rapa. \nTo the southeast is the uninhabited islet Motu Tauturu. \nMany mountains are in Rapa. The highest of them is Mt. Perau (650 m). Rapa has a land area of forty km\u00b2.\nRapa is 1240 kilometers away from Tahiti, the main island of French Polynesia.\nDemographics.\nMost inhabitants of Rapa are Polynesians. Polynesians are believed to inhabit the island in about 1000 BC.\nRapa has a population of 521 inhabitants (1996). Most of them are fishermen. The most spoken language of the island is Rapan. Most children and youth can also speak French. \nRapan is however an endangered language. It is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Tubuaian. \nCulture.\nThe most common form of Rapan folk music is himene tarava. The band The Tahitian Choir is from Rapa and its songs are sung in the Rapan language."}

It is the successor to Windows XP. While it was being made, it was called Longhorn. On July 28, 2005, Microsoft gave out its real name, which was Windows Vista. Microsoft stopped supporting Windows Vista on April 11, 2017.\nMicrosoft had worked on Vista for more than five years, so it came with many new features, such as improved graphics, new built-in programs, and stronger defenses against malware. However, Windows Vista introduced many changes to the way the operating system worked, which caused some older programs to stop working.\nVista editions and system requirements.\nVista was released in November 2006 for computer makers and January 30, 2007 for home users. The six main editions of Windows Vista are:\nSome editions are meant for home use, while others are made mainly for businesses. Starter Edition is similar to Windows XP Starter Edition, as it is a low-budget edition that was only released in countries where computers were not as common. Enterprise Edition is for big companies that need computers that have good performance. \nWindows Vista needs at least 512 MB of RAM to run on all computers. Some new parts of Vista need 1 GB of RAM to work and for better stability and performance. \nDevelopment.\nAt first, a major version of Windows code-named \"Blackcomb\" was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Features planned for Blackcomb included the Sidebar, an emphasis on looking for data, and an advanced storage system named WinFS. However, a minor release code-named \"Longhorn\" was announced for 2003, delaying the making of Blackcomb. By the middle of 2003, Longhorn had gotten some of the features meant for Blackcomb. After three major viruses exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time in 2003, Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while they made new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of Longhorn was reset in September 2004, and it was renamed to Windows Vista. A number of features were cut from Windows Vista as it was being remade.\nAfter Windows Vista was released, Microsoft announced a new plan for the next version of Windows, code-named \"Windows 7\", in 2007.\nService Packs.\nMicrosoft releases service packs to update software and fix problems to the operating system.\nService Pack 1.\nWindows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) was released on February 4, 2008 alongside Windows Server 2008 to OEM partners, after a five-month beta test period. The first use of the service pack caused a number of machines to continually reboot, making them unusable. This caused Microsoft to temporarily stop release of the service pack until the problem was resolved. The same release date of the two operating systems showed the merging of the workstation and server kernels back into a single code base for the first time since Windows 2000. MSDN subscribers were able to download SP1 on February 15, 2008. SP1 became available to current Windows Vista users on Windows Update and the Download Center on March 18, 2008. Initially, the service pack only supported 5 languages - English, French, Spanish, German and Japanese. Support for the remaining 31 languages was released on April 14, 2008.\nService Pack 2.\nService Pack 2 for Windows Vista was released to manufacturing on April 28, 2009, Windows Vista SP2 RTM + Windows Vista SP1 Blocker Tool Removed&lt;/ref&gt; and released to Microsoft Download Center and Windows Update on May 26, 2009.

It had a population of about 3,751,351 people in 2010. The state has a land area of about . Oklahoma is the 28th largest state by population and the 20th largest state by area. The name of the state comes from the Choctaw words \"okla\" and \"humma\". It means \"Red People\". It is also known by its nickname, \"The Sooner State.\" The state was formed from Indian Territory on November 16, 1907. It was the 46th state to become part of the United States. The people who live in the state are known as \"Oklahomans\" or \"Okies\". The state's capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.\nIn the past, Oklahoma was used as a path for cattle drives, a place for southern settlers, and a government-made territory for Native Americans.\nThe state is a large producer of natural gas, oil and food. It has large industries in aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. The state has one of the fastest growing economies in the nation. Between 2005 and 2006, it had the third highest percentage of income growth and the highest percentage in gross domestic product growth. Oklahoma City and Tulsa are the main economic areas of Oklahoma. Almost 60 percent of Oklahomans live in these two metropolitan statistical areas.\nOklahoma has small mountain ranges, prairies, and eastern forests. Most of Oklahoma is in the Great Plains. It is regularly hit by severe weather.\nThe cultural heritage of Oklahoma is made from by a population descending from many cultures. These include German, Irish, British and Native American people. There are more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, more than in any other state. Many people in Oklahoma believe in evangelical Christianity. The state is part of the Bible Belt. Oklahoma is one of the most politically conservative states, but voter registration is largest for the Democratic Party.\nHistory.\nOklahoma has only been a state for a little over a century, but its history is much longer. Arrow heads from the Clovis culture, Native Americans who traveled through Oklahoma have been found near the city Anadarko. These arrow heads are about 11,000 years old. The Spiro Mound Building Indians were the state's first permanent settlers. In 1541 the Spanish explorer Coranado traveled through Oklahoma while in search of the Lost City of Gold. During the 1830s, the Five Civilized Tribes were forced to move from the southeastern United States to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) on the Trail of Tears.\nDuring the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), several Indian tribes sided with the Confederacy. The tribes owned slaves. They agreed with the ideas of the states that seceded from the United States. Also, the tribes were not happy that the federal government did not do what it told them it would do. Not all the tribes sided with the Confederacy. Some tribes had taken control of several forts. This caused much of the Indian Territory to be under Confederate control, but Oklahoma did not become a Confederate state. The Battle of Honey Springs near Fort Gibson on July 17, 1863 was won by the Union forces. This ended the Confederate control of Indian Territory.\nOn April 22, 1890, the western part of the state was opened to almost 50,000 settlers for the Oklahoma Land Run. During this land run Oklahoma got its nickname, \"The Sooner State\". The nickname came from the settlers who crossed the territory's borders before the land was opened by the government. A year later, the western part of the territory was turned into Oklahoma territory. The northeastern part, which was home to the Five Civilized Tribes, stayed under the control of the tribes. On November 16, 1907, the western and eastern territories joined together. They became the 46th state of the United States.\nThe newly formed state became an important place for the oil industry. The oil pools in the area caused the population of towns to grow very quickly. Tulsa became known as the \"Oil Capital of the World\" for most of the 20th century. The oil was a large part of the state's early economy.\nIn 1927, Tulsa businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the \"Father of Route 66\", began a movement to make U.S. Route 66. Avery used section of highway that was already built between Tulsa and Amarillo, Texas to make the original portion of Highway 66. He was the main person responsible for making the U.S. Highway 66 Association to watch over the building of Route 66.\nDuring the 1930s, northwestern Oklahoma went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl. The area had little rainfall and high temperatures. This caused thousands of farmers to go into poverty and forced them to move to other parts of the United States. From 1930 to 1950, the state saw its only loss in population. It lost 6.9 percent of the people who lived there. Because of the Dust Bowl, the state made hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes. By the 1960s, more than 200 man-made lakes had been made. This is the most in the United States.\nThe song \"Oklahoma!\" was made the official song of the state in 1953. The song comes from the 1943 Broadway musical play \"Oklahoma!\". The story is set in Oklahoma Territory in 1906 just before Oklahoma became a state.\nOn April 19, 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed by Timothy McVeigh. 168 people were killed in the bombing. This was the worst terrorism attack in the United States before the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001. McVeigh and his partner, Terry Nichols, were both convicted of the bombing. Some people think other people were involved. McVeigh was later sentenced to death and executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. His partner, Nichols, was convicted of 161 counts of first degree murder. Nichols is spending the rest of his life in prison without the chance of being released.\nNaming history.\nThe name \"Oklahoma\" comes from the Choctaw phrase \"okla\" \"humma\". This means \"red\" (\"humma\") \"people\" (\"okla\"). Choctaw Chief Allen Wright gave it that name in 1866 during treaty talks with the federal government about the use of Indian Territory. He dreamed of an all-Indian state with power held by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. \"Okla humma\" was a phrase in the Choctaw language that meant the same as the English word \"Indian\". It was used to describe the Native American people all together. \"Oklahoma\" later became the \"de facto\" name for Oklahoma Territory. It was officially accepted in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.\nGeography.\nOklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of ( are land and are water). The state is shaped like a pan with a long, thin section on the west side. This section, known as the \"Panhandle\", is from west to east, and from north to south.\nIt is one of six states on the Frontier Strip. The state is partly in the Great Plains near the center of the 48 continental states. It shares borders with Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.\nThe highest point in the state is the Black Mesa, in the Panhandle at . The lowest point is Little River east of Idabel in the southeast part of the state at above sea level. There are four mountain ranges in Oklahoma. They are the Ouachita, Arbuckle, Wichita and Kiamichi ranges. All of the ranges are in the southern part of the state. Forests make up about 24 percent of the state. The state is also known for having more man-made lakes than any other state in the country. These lakes cover more than with water.\nPolitics.\nBy the start of the 21st century, conservative Republicans are the growing force in Oklahoma, but Democrats are still a major factor in statewide politics. In 2006, the incumbent Democrat governor won re-election by 66% over a former Republican Congressman. Despite the landslide victory for the Democrats, the Republicans gained two seats in the State Senate, making a 24 Democrat, 24 Republican tie in the senate, and increased their lead in the house of 57-44.\nWeather.\nOklahoma is in a temperate area of the country. The state sometimes sees extreme temperatures and rain that is commonly found in a continental climate. All of the state frequently has temperatures above or below .\nIt snows in Oklahoma. In the northwest near the Colorado border, the area can get nearly in snowfall during the winter. The southeastern part of the state usually gets less than in snowfall.\nMost of the state is in an area known as Tornado Alley. This is because there is a lot of contact between cold and warm air masses which makes severe weather. Oklahoma has an average of 54 tornadoes each year. This is one of the highest rates in the world. The state is home to the National Storm Prediction Center of the National Weather Service, in Norman.\nCities and towns.\nOklahoma had 549 populated places in 2006. It had three cities over 100,000 in population and 40 over 10,000. Two of the fifty largest cities in the United States are in Oklahoma. They are Oklahoma City and Tulsa. More than half of Oklahomans (58%) live in the two cities.\nOklahoma City is the state's capital and largest city. It had 1,269,907 people living inside its metropolitan area in 2008. Tulsa, the second largest city, had a metropolitan area population of 905,755.\nBetween 2005 and 2006, the Tulsa suburbs of Jenks, Bixby, and Owasso had the biggest population growth in the state. The population of Jenks grew by 47.9%, Bixby grew by 44.56%, and Owasso grew by 34.31%.\nOklahoma's largest cities in 2007 were: Oklahoma City (547,274), Tulsa (384,037), Norman (106,707), Lawton (91,568), Broken Arrow (90,714), Edmond (78,226), Midwest City (55,935), and Moore (51,106). Seven of the state's ten largest cities are in the metropolitan areas of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Only Lawton has a metropolitan area of its own.\nOklahoma law says that populated areas are divided into two groups. Cities are areas with more than 1,000 people. Towns have fewer than 1,000 people. Both have legislative, judicial, and public power inside their populated areas. Cities can choose between a mayor-council, council-manager, or strong mayor form of government. Towns are run through an elected officer system.\nSports.\nOklahoma has minor league sports teams in basketball, football, arena football, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. These teams are in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Enid and Lawton. Tulsa is home to the Tulsa 66ers. They are part the NBA Development League. The Tulsa Revolution, playing in the American Indoor Soccer League, is also in Tulsa. The NBA's New Orleans Hornets became the first major league sports team to play in Oklahoma. This happened after the team was forced to move to the Ford Center in Oklahoma City for two seasons after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In July 2008, the Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City. They play their home games at the Ford Center under the new team name, Oklahoma City Thunder. They are the state's first permanent major league team.\nState symbols.\nOklahoma's state symbols are recognized by state law. The Oklahoma Senate or House of Representatives may add others for special events and to help organizations.\nState symbols:"}

This unit was created by Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), a Swedish astronomer.\n0 degrees (\u00b0) Celsius is the melting point of pure water at sea level (\"normal pressure\"). \n100\u00b0 Celsius is the boiling point of water at normal pressure. (Water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes).\n1 \u00b0C is therefore one hundredth (the 100th part) of that difference.\nSince 1948, this unit has been called \"Celsius\". \"Centigrade\" was the name of the unit before the change. \"Centi\" meaning 1/100, and \"grade\" being a scale.\nThe other commonly used measurement of temperature is the Fahrenheit scale. The Celsius scale, based on multiples of ten, is used with SI, or metric measurements.\nHistory.\nIn 1742, Anders Celsius made a \"reversed\" version of the modern Celsius temperature scale. In this scale, zero was the boiling point of water and 100 was the melting point of ice. In his paper \"Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer,\" he wrote about his experiments. He showed that the melting point of ice was basically unaffected by air pressure. Ice would turn into water at the same temperature, whether it was at sea level or on a mountain. This was not the case for the boiling point of water. It would boil easier with less pressure (on a mountain). He decided that zero on his temperature scale (water's boiling point) would be set at the standard barometric pressure at sea level. This pressure is known as one atmosphere. In 1954, Resolution 4 of the 10th CGPM (the General Conference on Weights and Measures) set what exactly is one standard atmosphere ().\u00a0\nIn 1744, the year Anders Celsius died, the famous Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) used a reversed version of Celsius's scale when he bought his first thermometer. This had a scale where zero represented the melting point of ice and 100 represented water's boiling point, similar to what we use it today. His custom-made \"Linnaeus thermometer\", to use in his greenhouses, was made by Daniel Ekstr\u00f6m, then Sweden's leading maker of scientific instruments. Ekst\u00f6m's workshop was in the basement of the Stockholm observatory. As often happened in this age before modern communications, many physicists, scientists, and instrument makers are given credit with independently making the same measurement scale; among them were Pehr Elvius, the secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (which had an instrument workshop), who Linnaeus had also talked to; Christin of Lyons; Daniel Ekstr\u00f6m, the instrument maker; and M\u00e5rten Str\u00f6mer (1707\u20131770) who had studied astronomy under Anders Celsius.\nThe first known document reporting temperatures in this modern \"forward\" Celsius scale is the paper \"Hortus Upsaliensis\", dated 16 December 1745, that Linnaeus wrote to a student of his, Samuel Naucl\u00e9r. In it, Linnaeus reported the temperatures inside the orangery at the Botanical Garden of Uppsala University:\n...since the caldarium (the hot part of the greenhouse) by the angle of the windows, merely from the rays of the sun, obtains such heat that the thermometer often reaches 30 degrees, although the keen gardener usually takes care not to let it rise to more than 20 to 25 degrees, and in winter not under 15 degrees...\nFor the next 204 years, the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide called this scale the \"centigrade scale\". Temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported as \"degrees\" or \"degrees centigrade\". The symbol for temperature values on this scale was \u00b0C (in several formats over the years). Because the name \"centigrade\" was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (one-hundredth of a right angle) and had a similar meaning in other languages, the term \"centesimal degree\" was used when very precise, clear language was required for international communication, such as by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The 9th CGPM (General Conference on Weights and Measures) and the CIPM (International Committee for Weights and Measures) officially decided to use \"degree Celsius\" (symbol: \u00b0C) in 1948.\nThere were three reasons for the decision in 1948 to use the word \"Celsius\":\nIt would take nearly two decades however, for school textbooks to change from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\", and many people today still use the old name."}

In the twentieth century, the unit became less used, and the degree Celsius more used. Fahrenheit is still often used in the United States. In the United Kingdom, Fahrenheit is used on some websites, and on weather forecasts. The main reason for this is that the older population is more familiar with Fahrenheit.\nThe degree Fahrenheit is considered by many to be old fashioned and outdated way of measuring temperature. The degree Celsius has largely replaced Fahrenheit's use. However, Fahrenheit is understood by many ordinary people, whereas the Celsius scale is more abstract. The needs of ordinary people are often quite different to the needs of professional scientists and technicians.\nOverall, the use of the degree Fahrenheit is in decline throughout most of the world, with the USA being the main exception.\nExamples.\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32\u00b0 and boils at 212\u00b0."}

He became Emperor of the French and King of Italy as Napoleon I. He had power over most of Europe at the height of his power, and his actions shaped European politics in the early 19th century.\nBonaparte was born in Corsica into a noble family. He learned the Corsican language first before learning French. He moved to mainland France and trained to become an army officer. He became an important army leader during the First French Republic, helping to stop the countries that wanted to end the French Revolution. In 1799, he overthrew the government and took control of France for himself (a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\"). At first his title was Consul. Five years, he was made Emperor of France. In the first ten years of the nineteenth century, the French Empire under Napoleon waged the Napoleonic Wars. Every European great power joined in these wars. After a number of victories, France became very important in continental Europe. his power by making many alliances. He also made other European countries into French client states by letting his friends and family members rule them.\nThe French invasion of Russia in 1812 became Napoleon's first big defeat. His army was badly damaged and never fully recovered. In 1813, another Coalition defeated his forces at Leipzig. The year after that, they attacked France and won. The Coalition exiled Napoleon to the island of Elba. Less than a year later, he escaped Elba and briefly returned to be the Emperor of France. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon spent the last six years of his life exiled to the island of Saint Helena, which was controlled by the British, and died at the age of 51. A doctor said he died of stomach cancer. Some scientists think he was poisoned, though others disagree.\nNapoleon is remembered as a brilliant army leader, and his campaigns are studied at military schools all over the world. People have many different views on whether he was a good or bad ruler. He brought many ideas of liberalism and the French Revolution to the countries he conquered, such as the Napoleonic code, freedom of religion and making education and government more modern. His enemies remembered him as a tyrant and some historians criticise him for causing many wars .\nBirth and education.\nNapoleon Bonaparte was born in Casa Buonaparte in the town of Ajaccio, Corsica, on the 15th of August 1769. This was one year after the island was given to France by the Republic of Genoa. He was the second of eight children. He was named \"Napoleone di Buonaparte\". He took his first name from an uncle who had been killed fighting the French. However, he later used the more French-sounding \"Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte\".\nThe Corsican Buonapartes were from lower Italian nobility. They had come to Corsica in the 16th century. His father \"Nobile\" Carlo Buonaparte became Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1777. The greatest influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Maria Letizia Ramolino. Her firm education controlled a wild child. He had an older brother, Joseph. He also had younger siblings Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline and J\u00e9r\u00f4me. Napoleon was baptized as a Catholic just before his second birthday, on 21 July 1770 at Ajaccio Cathedral.\nAlthough raised a Catholic, Napoleon was a deist.\nEarly military career.\nNapoleon was able to enter the military academy at Brienne in 1779. He was nine years old when he entered the academy. He moved to the Parisian \u00c9cole Royale Militaire in 1784 and graduated a year later as a second lieutenant of artillery. Napoleon was able to spend much of the next eight years in Corsica. There he played an active part in political and military matters. He came into conflict with the Corsican nationalist Pasquale Paoli, and his family was forced to flee to Marseille in 1793.\nThe French Revolution caused much fighting and disorder in France. At times, Napoleon was connected to those in power. Other times, he was in jail. In the French Revolutionary Wars he helped the Republic against royalists who supported the former king of France. In September 1793, he assumed command of an artillery brigade at the siege of Toulon, where royalist leaders had welcomed a British fleet and troops. The British were driven out in December 17, 1793, and Bonaparte was rewarded with promotion to brigadier general and assigned to the French army in Italy in February 1794.\n13 Vend\u00e9miaire.\nGeneral Napoleon Bonaparte was later appointed by the republic to repel the royalists on October 5, 1795 (13 Vend\u00e9miaire Year IV in French Republican Calendar). More than a 1400 royalists died and the rest fled. He had cleared the streets with \"a whiff of grapeshot\" according to the 19th-century historian Thomas Carlyle. He was then promoted to major general and marked his name on the French Revolution.\nThe defeat of the Royalist rebellions ended the threat to the Convention and earned Bonaparte sudden fame, wealth, and the patronage of the new Directory. On March 9, 1796, Napoleon married Josephine de Beauharnais, a widow older than he was and a very unlikely wife to the future ruler.\nItalian Campaign.\nThe campaign in Italy is the first time Napoleon led France to war. Late in March 1796, Bonaparte began a series of operations to divide and defeat the Austrian and Sardinian armies in Italy. He defeated the Sardinians in April 21, bringing Savoy and Nice into France. Then, in a series of brilliant battles, he won Lombardy from the Austrians. Mantua, the last Lombard stronghold fell in February 1797.\nEgyptian Campaign.\nIn May 1798, General Napoleon left for a campaign in Egypt. The French needed to threaten British India and the French Directory was concerned that Napoleon would take control of France. The French Army under Napoleon won an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Pyramids. Barely 300 French soldiers died, while thousands of Mamluks (an old power in the Middle East) were killed. But his army was weakened by bubonic plague and poor supplies because the Navy was defeated at the Battle of the Nile. The Egyptian campaign was a military failure but a cultural success. The Rosetta Stone was found by French engineer Captain Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Bouchard, and French scholar Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion was able to read the words in the stone. Napoleon went back to France because of a change in the French government. Some believe that Napoleon should not have left his soldiers in Egypt. Napoleon helped lead the Brumaire coup d'\u00e9tat of November 1799.\nRuler of France.\nBonaparte returned to Paris in October 1799. France's situation had been improved by a series of victories but the Republic was bankrupt, and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population. He was approached by one of the Directors, Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s, for his support in a coup to overthrow the constitutional government. The leaders of the plot included his brother Lucien Bonaparte (the speaker of the Council of Five Hundred), Roger Ducos, another Director, Joseph Fouch\u00e9, and Charles Maurice Talleyrand. Other deputies realised they faced an attempted coup. Faced with their protests, Bonaparte led troops to seize control and disperse them, which left a rump legislature to name Bonaparte, Si\u00e8yes, and Ducos as the three provisional Consuls to administer the government.\nSiey\u00e8s expected to dominate the new regime, but he was outmaneuvered by Bonaparte. Napoleon drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII, and secured his own election as First Consul. This made Bonaparte the most powerful person in France, and he took up residence at the Tuileries.\nIn 1800, Napoleon ensured his power by crossing the Alps and defeating the Austrians at Marengo. He then negotiated a general European peace that established the Rhine River as the eastern border of France. He also concluded an agreement with the pope (the Concordat of 1801), which contributed to French domestic tranquility by ending the quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church that had arisen during the French Revolution.\nIn France the administration was reorganized, the court system was simplified, and all schools were put under centralized control. French law was standardized in the Napoleonic Code, or civil code, and six other codes. They guaranteed the rights and liberties won in the Revolution, including equality before the law and freedom of religion.\nEmperor of France.\nIn February 1804, a British-financial plot against Bonaparte was uncovered by the former police minister Joseph Fouche. It gave Napoleon a reason to start a hereditary dynasty. On December 2, 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte crowned himself \"Emperor of the French\". The people of France did not see him as the monarch of the old regime because of his holding a Roman Empire title. He invited Pope Pius VII to see his coronation at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. During the ceremony, Napoleon I took the crown from the pope's hand and placed it on his own head. This had been agreed on between Napoleon and the Pope. At Milan Cathedral on May 26 1805, Napoleon was crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\nReforms.\nTo restore prosperity, Napoleon modernized finance. He regulated the economy to control prices, encouraged new industry, and built roads and canals. To ensure well-trained officials and military officers, he promoted a system of public schools under firm government control. He also repealed some social reforms of the revolution. He made peace with the Catholic Church in the Concordat of 1801. The Concordat kept the Church under state control but recognized religious freedom for Catholics.\nNapoleon I won support across class lines. He encouraged the \u00e9migr\u00e9 population to return, provided they gave an oath of loyalty. Peasants were relieved when he recognized their right to lands they had bought during the revolution. Napoleon's chief opposition came from royalists and republicans.\nNapoleonic Code.\nAmong Napoleon's most lasting reforms was a new law code, popularly called the Napoleonic Code. It embodied Enlightenment principles such as equality of all citizens before the law, religious toleration, and advancement based on virtue. But the Napoleonic Code undid some reforms of the French Revolution. Women, for example, lost most of their newly gained rights under the new code. The law considered women minors who could not exercise the rights of citizenship. Male heads of households regained full authority over their wives and children. Again, Napoleon valued order and authority over individual rights.\nThe Grand Empire.\nEmperor Napoleon abandoned plans to invade England and turned his armies against the Austro-Russian forces, defeating them at the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805. In 1806 Napoleon destroyed the Prussian army at Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt and the Russian army at Friedland. He crowned his elder brother Joseph Bonaparte as King of Naples and Sicily in 1806 and converted the Dutch Republic into the kingdom of Holland for his brother Louis. Napoleon also established the Confederation of the Rhine (most of the German states) of which he was protector.\nTo legitimize his rule, he divorced his wife Jos\u00e9phine and married Marie Louise, duchess of Parma and daughter of the Emperor Francis I of Austria. Soon she delivered a son and heir to the Bonaparte Dynasty. He was named Napol\u00e9on Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Charles Bonaparte or Napoleon II and crowned King of Rome from his birth.\nAt Tilsit in July 1807, Napoleon made an ally of Russian tsar Alexander Romanov and greatly reduced the size of Prussia. He also added new states to the empire: the kingdom of Westphalia, under his youngest brother Jerome, the duchy of Warsaw, and others states.\nDefeat.\nThe Congress of Erfurt sought to preserve the Russo-French alliance and the leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. However, on June 23, 1812, Napoleon went to war with Russia. The French invasion of Russia defeated many Russian cities and villages, but by the time they reached Moscow it was winter. Due to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found little food for themselves and their horses. Napoleon's army was unable to defeat the Russians. The Russians began to attack. Napoleon and his army had to go back to France. The French suffered greatly in during Napoleon's retreat. Most of his soldiers never returned to France. His army was reduced to 70,000 soldiers and 40,000 stragglers, against more than three times as many Allied troops. Finally at the 1813 Battle of the Nations he was defeated by the Allies: Sweden, Russia, Austria, and Prussia.\nExile in Elba.\nNapoleon had no choice but to abdicate in favor of his son. However, the Allies refused to accept this. Napoleon abdicated without conditions on April 11, 1814. Before his official abdication, Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill but it did not work. In the Treaty of Fontainebleau the victors exiled him to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean. The Allies allowed Napoleon to keep an imperial title \"Emperor of Elba\" and an allowance of 2 million francs a year. Napoleon even requested a 21 gun salute as emperor of the island of Elba. Many delegates feared that Elba was too close to Europe to keep such a dangerous force.\nThe Hundred Days.\nSeparated from his son and wife, who had come under Austrian control, cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean, Napoleon escaped from Elba on February 26 1815. He made a surprise march on March 1, 1815 to Paris. His former troops joined him and Louis XVIII fled to exile. He again became ruler of France for a length of 100 days. Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by the British under Duke of Wellington and Prussians on June 18 1815, which was his last battle. Napoleon was again captured and taken to his second exile on the island of Saint Helena on the Atlantic Ocean.\nSecond exile and death.\nNapoleon was sent to the island of Saint Helena, off the coast of Africa. He died on May 5 1821 of stomach cancer. Napoleon kept himself up to date of the events through The Times and hoped for release in the event that Holland became Prime Minister. There were other plots to rescue Napoleon from captivity including one from Texas, where exiled soldiers from the Grande Arm\u00e9e wanted a resurrection of the Napoleonic Empire in America. There was even a plan to rescue him with a primitive submarine. For Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely and flawed genius. The news that Napoleon had taken up gardening at Longwood also appealed to more domestic British sensibilities.\nLegacy.\nFrench people remain proud of Napoleon's glory days. The Napoleonic Code reflects the modern French Constitution. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th century operational mobility underwent significant change. Napoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare. His popularity would later help his nephew Louis-Napol\u00e9on to become ruler of France more than 30 years later.\nOn the world stage, Napoleon's conquest spread the ideas of the revolution. He failed to make Europe into a French Empire. Instead, he sparked nationalist feeling across Europe. He was also known as \u201cThe Leader Of France\u201d.\nHistorians have many different views on Napoleon. Some historians say that he caused wars that killed many people in Europe, and therefore he was a bad ruler. Vincent Cronin disagrees with the view, saying that most of the Napoleonic Wars were started by Napoleon's enemies. Others argue that Napoleon made the mistake of trying to conquer too much land and that if he had stopped in 1808, his enemies might have left him alone. Other historians have said that he was a good ruler. They usually focus on the changes he brought to France and the countries he conquered. Andrew Roberts lists the greatest ideas that Napoleon brought to France and other countries as the Napoleonic code, freedom of religion, better civil services, better education, more equality, support for science and art and others."}

He painted about 300 different paintings. . He originally worked as a commercial artist. He designed things like advertisements and window displays for stores. He soon became famous as an artist in the Pop Art movement, in which everyday objects and media images were used. One of his most famous paintings is his colourful portrait of American movie star, Marilyn Monroe.

When Numitor's brother Amulius became king by force, he made Rhea Silvia a Vestal Virgin, so she would not have children who could be kings instead of him. But the god Mars seduced her and she had the twins Romulus and Remus. Rhea Silvia was punished, and her sons were thrown into the Tiber, but were saved by the river god Tiberinus, who also saved Rhea Silvia and married her. Romulus and Remus were found by a wolf who suckled them. A woodpecker fed them. The brothers were later found by a shepherd, Faustulus, who raised them.\nThe founding of Rome.\nOnce they were grown, Romulus and Remus founded the city of Rome. However, the twins had an argument about where to start Rome. Romulus favored the Palatine Hill, but Remus favored the Aventine Hill. They decided to settle the disagreement by asking the gods. Each brother stood on his respective hill. Remus saw six birds fly overhead, and Romulus saw twelve. However, Remus countered that he had seen the birds first. Nonetheless, Romulus started to build a wall around his city. Then, Remus jumped over the wall as an insult to his brother. Angered, Romulus killed Remus. He regretted it, and took Remus to Amulius's palace, and buried him there."}

Confucianism has a complete system of moral, social, political, and religious thought, and has had a large influence on the history of Chinese civilization. Some people think Confucianism should be called a religion but others do not agree.\nConfucianism was made to stop the fall of Chinese society. After the Zhou Dynasty fell, people cared only for themselves and did not have any respect for others. Confucianism became a social order for China, teaching that social relationships are the most important. People slowly started to believe in it, because they wanted to have peace, but they had to care for themselves too. As a result, Confucianism brought the people love, harmony, and respect for one another.\nConfucianism was started in Ch'u-fu, Confucius's birthplace. Today, Confucianism has spread around the world, but it is still more important in China.\nThe teachings of Confucius focus largely on the respect of one's parents, elders, and ancestors. He also taught that humans 'can never stop learning'; meaning that knowledge is infinite, therefore we will always learn, never stopping. For example, he once asked a seven-year-old child to be his teacher, because the child knew something that he did not.\nConfucianism Beliefs and Teachings.\nConfucianism teaches 5 virtues.\nChinese culture that exists today has its roots in Confucianism. Confucius believed that families are the building blocks of a society, which is why he laid emphasis on Filial Piety, which is known as \"xi\u00e0o\" (\u5b5d) in Chinese. Filial Piety means loyalty towards ones family. A Filial son is expected to take care of his parents and go to any extent to make their wishes come true.\nThe book, \"Analects\", describes the teachings of Confucius and was written by his disciples."}

Its chemical symbol is Pb, which comes from \"plumbum\", the Latin word for lead. Its atomic number is 82, atomic mass is 207.2 and has a melting point of 327.8\u00b0C. It is a very poisonous and heavy metal.\nProperties.\nPhysical properties.\nLead is a shiny, gray-blue poor metal. It gets tarnished easily to a dull gray color. It is soft and malleable. It is very shiny when it is melted. It is very heavy. It is very corrosion-resistant. It is made stronger by adding antimony or calcium. It can form an alloy with sodium. It is toxic to people and animals when swallowed.\nChemical properties.\nLead burns in air with a grayish-white flame, making toxic fumes of lead(II) oxide. Only the surface is corroded by air. It dissolves in nitric acid to make lead(II) nitrate. It does not dissolve in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. It reacts with sodium nitrate to make lead(II) oxide and sodium nitrite. It reacts with chlorine to make lead(II) chloride. Lead(II) oxide reacts with lead sulfide to make lead metal and sulfur dioxide.\nChemical compounds.\nLead makes chemical compounds in two main oxidation states: +2 and +4. +2 compounds, also known as lead(II) compounds or plumbous compounds, are weak oxidizing agents. +4 compounds, also known as lead(IV) compounds or plumbic compounds, are strong oxidizing agents. Lead compounds are toxic just like the element. The lead halides do not dissolve in water. Lead(IV) oxide is the most common lead(IV) compound. It is a black solid. The lead oxides are all colored, while the other salts are white or colorless. Lead nitrate and lead(II) acetate are the soluble compounds of lead.\nThis state is more common than the +4 state. These are weak oxidizing agents. All but the oxides are colorless or white.\nMixed oxidation state compounds contain lead in the +2 and +4 oxidation state.\nThese are less common. They are strong oxidizing agents. \nOccurrence.\nLead is found very rarely in the earth's crust as a metal. Normally, lead is in the mineral galena. Galena is lead sulfide. Galena is the main lead ore.\nHistory.\nLead was used for thousands of years because it is easy to get from the ground and easy to shape and work with. The Romans used lead very commonly. They used it for pipes, drinking vessels, and fasteners.\nPreparation.\nLead is made from galena. Galena is made pure by froth flotation to get all the impurities out. Then the lead sulfide is roasted in a furnace to make lead(II) oxide. The lead(II) oxide is heated with coke to make liquid lead metal.\nUses.\nAs an element.\nLead is used in the ballast of sailboats. It is also used in weight belts for scuba diving. It is also used to make shotgun pellets and bullets for small arms. Some printing presses use lead type because it can be easily shaped. It can be used outside because it does not corrode in water. \nMost lead is used in lead acid batteries, though. The lead is oxidized, making electricity. Sheets of lead are used to block sound in some places. Lead is used in radiation shielding. Molten lead can be used as a coolant in nuclear reactors. It used to be mixed with tin to make the pipes in pipe organs. Different amounts of lead make different sounds. In addition, lead has found its usage in solder.\nIt is used in some solder. It is used in covering for wires that carry high voltage. Some tennis rackets have lead in them to make them heavier. It is used to balance wheels of cars, to make statues, and to make decorative looks in buildings.\nAs chemical compounds.\nMany lead compounds are used to make colored glazes in ceramics. Lead can be used in PVC pipes. Lead compounds are added to candles to make them burn better. Lead glass has lead(II) oxide in it. Lead compounds are still used as pigments in some places. Lead compounds were added to gasoline, but are now outlawed. Some lead compounds are semiconductors and are used in photodetectors. \nOld uses.\nLead was used in many red, yellow, and white pigments in paints. Lead was also used in pesticides. Lead used to be used in pipes carrying water, but now it is not because lead can leach into the water.\nSafety.\nAlthough it can be safely touched, exposure to lead should be avoided \u2013 it is very toxic to humans and other animals when swallowed, and its use is restricted in many countries. \nIf someone is exposed to lead for a long time, it ruins their kidneys and gives them abdominal pains. Lead also ruins the nervous system. Lead paint was being eaten by children and they were getting lead poisoning.\nThe best way to understand lead and its properties is to read its MSDS."}

Its capital and largest city is Charleston. It is often abbreviated W. Va. or simply WV.\nWest Virginia is bordered by Pennsylvania to the north, by Ohio to the north and west, by Kentucky to the west, by Maryland to the north and east, and by Virginia to the east and south. The Ohio and Potomac Rivers form parts of the boundaries.\nBefore the American Civil War, West Virginia practiced slavery as part of the state of Virginia. Slaves, at first Native American but increasingly brought from Africa in the slave trade, were forced to grow tobacco, mine coal, and be personal servants. Many slaves were rented from owners in other parts of the state to work in the mines. In the 19th century, white people kept slaves in order to earn money by selling them south to states like Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia.\nStatehood Of West Virginia.\nWest Virginia was admitted into the union as a slave state in 1863. Slavery was abolished after the war, and Confederate veterans voted the politicians who passed the laws out of office.\nWest Virginia was once a part of Virginia. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Virginia and the other southern states seceded from the United States, which means they chose to not be a part of it anymore. Slaves were fewer in the west than in other parts, and those in West Virginia who were against slavery were not objecting on moral grounds. They saw it as bad for free labor. While slavery was an issue in other parts of Virginia, in the western counties the issues were taxation and being governed from a state capital that was far away. The people in Western Virginia had far more in common with their neighboring states of Pennsylvania and Ohio than with the Commonwealth of Virginia. So this was an area of Union support.\nOn June 20, 1863, West Virginia became the thirty-fifth state of the United States. But it was not an easy process. There had been some discussion of the area becoming a state since the early 1800s. It took three conventions at Wheeling from 1861 to 1863. The process divided friends and communities.\nStatehood was not universally accepted in West Virginia. While there were no large scale battles, there was a good deal of guerilla warfare in attempts to undermine the new government. Confederates raided into West Virginia trying to terrorize the citizens. Despite Confederate efforts to topple the state government, Washington provided both economic and political support. Union military successes outside the state helped keep the state government in power. After the war there were bitter resentments between those for and against statehood. Virginia even tried to force West Virginia back into becoming a part of Virginia again in 1871. But West Virginia remained a sovereign state despite the efforts.\nGeography.\nWest Virginia is often called the \"Mountain State\" because it is entirely within the Appalachian Mountain Range, and there are many hills and mountains throughout the state. The highest one is Spruce Knob, which is 4,863 feet above sea level. There are many rivers, including the Ohio, the Potomac, the Kanawha, and the Monongahela."}

South Carolina thus became a Democratic stronghold. In fact, in 1904, Republican Theodore Roosevelt, who was running for president, won less than 5% of the vote in the state.

The Narragansett people lived there before Europeans came, but people like Roger Williams didn't respect them and used the land for their own reasons. The colonists fought a war against the native people and many of them were killed or ran away from the colonists.\nRhode Island was one of the original Thirteen Colonies. It became very important to the economy because of the slave trade, and more slaves were taken to the thirteen colonies through Rhode Island than any of the others in the 18th century. Slavers would send ships from Newport to buy slaves from Africa and make money by trading goods with others involved in slavery. Rhode Island became a state (the last of the thirteen to agree to the new United States Constitution) in 1790.\nRhode Island is bordered on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the west by Connecticut, and on the south by Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. It shares a water border with New York. It is named for a large island in Rhode Island Sound. Rhode Island Some thought the island looked liked Rhodes, an island in Greece.

The capital of North Carolina is Raleigh and the biggest city in the state is Charlotte. North Carolina is split into 100 counties and these counties have many cities and towns.\nNorth Carolina was one of the original thirteen colonies and was where the first English colony in America lived. As of July 1, 2014, there are about 10,146,788 people living in the state.\nIn 2018, North Carolina was ranked number one on Forbes' Best States for Business ranking for a second year in a row.\nPolitics.\nUntil recently, North Carolina had long leaned Democratic. In presidential elections, it has voted Democratic twice as many times as it has voted Republican. In presidential elections from 1968 to 2004, North Carolina supported the Democrat only in 1976, when he came from the South. However, from presidential elections from the century of 1868 to 1964, inclusive, North Carolina voted for the Democrat in all 25 elections except for 1928. Despite the fact that North Carolina is steadily growing conservative, the governor, Roy Cooper, is a Democrat. \nMajor Cities.\nThey are:\nRaleigh.\nRaleigh is also the capital of North Carolina.\nCharlotte.\nCharlotte is the most populous city in North Carolina. \nAsheville.\nAsheville is in West North Carolina. The population is 84,000 or so.\nGeography.\nNorth Carolina touches South Carolina on the south, Georgia on the southwest, Tennessee on the west, Virginia on the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The state is divided into three distinct geographical areas, the Coastal Plains to the east, the centrally located Piedmont region, and the mountain ranges of Appalachia to the west. The eastern seaboard of the state is lined with a string of barrier islands known as The Outer Banks.\nNorth Carolina is known for its varying weather across the geographically diverse regions of the state.\nCoastal Plain (East North Carolina).\nThe eastern part of the state is touched by the Atlantic Ocean, and usually has moderate temperatures all year long with the summer average high temperature usually not above 90\u00a0\u00b0F in the summer and not under 40\u00a0\u00b0F in the winter. However, it can get as hot as the low 100s\u00a0\u00b0F and as cold as 20\u00a0\u00b0F. Most years there is less than one inch of snow and some years pass with no snow at all. The coastal plain usually gets a tropical storm every 3 or 4 years.\nPiedmont (Middle North Carolina).\nThe average temperature normally does not go above 90\u00a0\u00b0F in most parts of the Piedmont in summer, but can go over 100\u00a0\u00b0F when there is a heat wave. Ice pellets and freezing rain are normal in this part of North Carolina, but the mountain ranges protect the Piedmont from the worst winter weather. Snow in this region rarely lasts more than 48 hours before melting. Weak tornadoes are often seen in the Piedmont, but only 140 people have died by tornadoes from 1950-2012 in the entire state.\nMountains (West North Carolina).\nThe average temperature almost never goes above 80\u00a0\u00b0F in the summer and is usually in the high 30\u2019s or low 40\u2019s in the winter in the mountain region of North Carolina. About 14 to 20 inches of snow fall each year with some of the higher elevations getting 50 inches each winter. The wettest part of the mountains gets 90 inches of rain.\nHistory.\nThe Beginning.\nBefore the English came, about 30 Native American groups lived in North Carolina. In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh started two colonies in what is now known as North Carolina, but they did not last long. One of these, the Roanoke Colony later became known as the \"Lost Colony\" and is still known as one of the great unsolved mysteries of early American history to this day. Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the America, was born in the Roanoke Colony.\nThe first permanent settlers in North Carolina came from the state of Virginia in 1655 because there was not enough farmland in Virginia. Later the land was cut up into present-day North Carolina and South Carolina. The name \"Carolina\" comes from the Latin for Charles (\"Carolus\") after King Charles I.\nThe Seaborne Slave Trade of North Carolina from the North Carolina Historical Review reports that slaves imported to North Carolina prior to the Revolution from extant records came mainly from the West Indies, most particularly Montego Bay, Jamaica; Barbados; Antigua; and the Bahamas; a small number from mainland colonies; and an even smaller number directly from Africa, though imports between the years 1772-1775 rarely exceeded 150 slaves annually (Minchinton).\nThe economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted first to the production of tobacco.\nThe American Revolutionary War.\nNorth Carolina was an important state during the American Revolutionary War.\nThe Civil War.\nIn 1860, North Carolina was a slave state. About 1/3 of the people in the state were slaves. North Carolina fought as part of the Confederacy during the Civil War, but it was the last state to leave the Union. The state sent about 125,000 troops to fight in the war and about 40,000 of them died. Even during the war some people in North Carolina did not support the Confederacy, mostly because the Confederacy believed in slavery. The first Confederate soldier to be killed was from North Carolina.\nEconomy.\nFarming and Manufacturing.\nFarms in North Carolina grow many different foods such as grapes, peanuts, Christmas trees, poultry and eggs, wheat, corn, cucumbers, apples, greens, tobacco, hogs, milk, cattle, sweet potatoes, and soybeans. North Carolina grows more tobacco than any other state in the country. Furniture making is an important industry in North Carolina, but over the past few years many jobs have moved to other countries like China and India.\nBanking and Technology.\nCharlotte, the biggest city in North Carolina, is the second biggest banking city in the United States, making banking very important in North Carolina. BB&amp;T and Bank of America have their main offices in the state.\nTechnology is also important in North Carolina. There are many companies that make computer software and video games in the state. Winston-Salem is a center for innovation in biomedical and material sciences and information technology called the Wake Forest Innovation Quarter. Research Triangle Park near the state capital of Raleigh is one of the largest research parks in the world.\u00a0\nMedical Research and Care.\nNorth Carolina has four hospitals that are nationally ranked with many NICUs at a IV rating (highest possible rating in the United States). Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center is reported by the U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of the top hospitals in the nation. Brenner Children's Hospital and Health Services is designated a Nurse Magnet facility and it was rated in 2014 as one of America's best children's hospitals.\nTransportation.\nRoads.\nNorth Carolina has more state maintained roads than any other American state. The biggest roads are:\nAirports.\nThere are many major and international airports in North Carolina. These are:"}

It is in the northeastern section of the country along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. It is a geographically small state, shaped like a letter [S], and bordered on the west by Pennsylvania and Delaware across the Delaware River, on the north by New York, on the northeast by the Hudson River and New York City, on the east and southeast by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the southwest by Delaware Bay.\nThe capital of New Jersey is Trenton and the largest city is Newark, though New Jersey is better known for bordering the large cities of New York City and Philadelphia. The state nickname is \"The Garden State\". The current governor is Phil Murphy.\nNew Jersey is the fourth smallest state, but has the eleventh highest number of people. It therefore has the highest population density (number of people for the amount of land) in the United States. New Jersey is also well known for its beaches, industries, swamps, and pine forests.\nThe climate is hot and humid summers and cold winters, with about 1200\u00a0mm of precipitation every year. The average temperature in July is 25-30 degrees Celsius and in January around freezing point.\nHistory.\nBefore Europeans came, the land that is now New Jersey was inhabited by the Lenape (also known as Delaware Indians by the English), who were nomads, hunters, and farmers. The Dutch came to the northern area of the state in the 1630s, after Henry Hudson explored the area, thought it was a nice place, and claimed it for the Dutch. Towns quickly sprang up, occupied by the Dutch, Swedes, and Finns. People rushed in. The first towns, such as Bergen (now Jersey City), Trenton (the capitol), and Burlington developed. Many others started themselves upon the west bank of the Hudson. New Jersey was part of the area known at this time as New Netherland.\nIn 1664, the English took New Netherland from the Dutch and added it to their colonies. This part was renamed New Jersey after an island in the English Channel known as Jersey.\nNew Jersey took part in the American Revolutionary War, and was a scene of battles. On Christmas in 1776, George Washington's army entered New Jersey to attack British soldiers at Trenton and Princeton. The American army won, in two small but famous battles that were important in boosting American morale.\nLater, the rebels drove the British residents out of Princeton and for a time established a national capital there. New Jersey would be the third state to join the United States of America and the first to approve the Bill of Rights.\nCounties.\nNew Jersey has 21 counties:"}

{"id": "14880", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14880", "title": "Mormonism", "text": "Mormonism is a Christian restorationist religious movement that was founded by Joseph Smith. For many years, members of the church were known as \"Mormons\" by those who were not members. The name \"Mormons\" is simply no longer a name for them. They are now called \u201cMembers of The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints\u201d. Their religious movement is called \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\". Its teachings are similar to many Christian churches, and they consider themselves to be Christian, although some non-members do not consider them to be Christian. A 2007 survey showed that 31% of the people polled do not agree that Mormons are Christians. Mormons have beliefs that are different from the beliefs of mainstream Christian churches. The Mormon Church considers itself a restoration church. This means that members of the Church believe that it is the original Christian Church started by Jesus Christ and brought back (\"restored\") by Joseph Smith, Jr. in 1830. Mormonism and Bahaism are sometimes called the \"fourth Abrahamic religion\".\nToday there are about 70 groups who call themselves \"Mormon\". The largest and best-known of them is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They believe in baptism by the person being completely underwater (baptism by immersion), such as explained in the Articles of Faith that was written in a letter by Joseph Smith through revelation from Heavenly Father.\nFirst vision.\nJoseph Smith, Jr. said that he had visits from God the Father, Jesus Christ, and many angels. The first visit is called the First Vision. It happened when Joseph was 14 years old. He had decided to pray about which religion to join. He said that he went to the woods far from his family's house in New York, prayed, felt evil powers fighting him, and was rescued when a bright light appeared above him. In the bright light, he said that he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ. They told him not to join any church, because none of the churches had all of the truth. They also told him that they had work for him to do.\nThe Book of Mormon.\nPart of the work that Joseph did was translating the Book of Mormon. Joseph said that an angel named Moroni visited him and showed him where a very old book was buried. This book was written on plates of gold (sometimes called the Gold Plates). It was buried in a stone box in a hill near Joseph's home in New York. Moroni visited Joseph once a year for four years until he told Joseph to take the Gold Plates. Since the book was written in a very old language, Joseph translated the book into English. He did this with help from God and by the tools called the \"Urim\" and \"Thummim\". The book was published as The Book of Mormon in 1830. It tells the story of two main groups of people who lived in North and South America hundreds of years ago (the Nephites and Lamanites), as well as a story of a group of people who came to the Americas thousands of years ago upon leaving the Tower of Babel (the Jaredites). It also teaches many things about Jesus. To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The Book of Mormon is a special book from God comparable to the Bible. Mormons believe that by reading The Book of Mormon and the Bible, people can learn how to get closer to God and how to find happiness in life. This book is also the reason Church members are sometimes called \"Mormons\".\nMormon beliefs and practices.\nToday the center of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is in Utah, but there are more than 16 million Mormons living all over the world. The leader of the church is called the president, and followers call him a prophet. They believe that God guides the prophet, just like God guided Joseph Smith and the prophets in the Bible. Members of the church believe that it is important for families to spend a lot of time together, and that after they die, they can live together forever. Active members do not drink alcohol, coffee, or tea, or smoke tobacco. They meet once a week on Sunday for church, where they have the sacrament and listen to short talks or sermons. They also have Sunday School to learn more. The church also has activities during the week. Mormons also have buildings called temples. These are the most holy buildings in their religion. When a Temple is first built, and after renovations, the general public is invited to tour the inside. However, after a temple has been dedicated, only church members that have had a worthiness interview with the bishop or stake president may enter.\nBig movements in Mormonism.\nToday, there are three main movements in Mormonism, although one is by far the largest. They are represented by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Community of Christ and the Church of Christ with the Elijah Message. When people talk about Mormons, they usually mean the followers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is the largest Mormon movement. This movement also says that the term \"Mormon\" is a nickname given to members early in the church's history, and would prefer to be referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\" or \"LDS\".\nDifferent groups' beliefs.\nSome people who call themselves Mormons are not part of \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\" These people belong to other Mormon churches. Some of their beliefs are different.\nWhen Brigham Young became the second president of the Church after Joseph Smith was killed, some people did not think he was the rightful president. When Brigham Young led most of the Mormons to Utah, these people stayed in Illinois. They believed that Joseph Smith's son should be the next president. Today, this church is called the Community of Christ. It is the second largest church to call themselves Mormons. They have more than 250,000 people in their church. Other Mormons teach very different lessons that the Community of Christ do not.\nOther splits in the Church happened later. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) teaches that a man should only marry one woman. This is called monogamy. In the beginning of the church, this was different. A man could be married to more than one woman at the same time (called polygamy). When the Church changed its position in 1890, some people left the official Church and continued with polygamy. These groups are very small compared to the LDS. The groups that did not want to abandon polygamy are sometimes still called \"Mormon\", even though in the official church, polygamy has been forbidden since 1890. Most of these smaller groups stay away from other people, since polygamy is illegal in the United States. The LDS tells people not to use the word \"Mormon\" or pictures of Church leaders and temples when talking about these groups, since it makes it seem like they are still connected to the LDS even though they are not.\nMormonism and Christianity.\nThere are many practices in Mormonism that are very similar to those used in Christian movements. There are some practices, however, where the Mormon movement is noticeably different from other Christian movements, such as Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant faiths. People who define Christianity as belonging to one of those denominations generally say that Mormonism is not a Christian movement.\nIn English, the LDS Church accepts the King James Version of the Bible as a part of its official scripture.\nIn the beginning, the Mormon movement said that it restored the Christian faith and that the other movements at the time held beliefs that were wrong. In the 1830s, the movement quickly gained members that had come from Christian movements. Many Christians of the time saw some of the practices and beliefs the Mormon movement held at that time as politically and culturally subversive. The most controversial of these included the idea that slavery was wrong, men being able to have more than one wife, and the church's wanting to run a government with laws based on Mormonism. Some of these beliefs are no longer held by most Mormon movements today. Such disagreements led to violent conflicts between Mormons and mainstream Christian groups. Even though there is not really violence anymore, the movement's unique doctrinal views are still criticized.\nMormons believe in Jesus Christ as the literal firstborn Son of God and Messiah, his crucifixion as a conclusion of a sin offering, and resurrection.\nHowever, Latter-day Saints (LDS) reject the ecumenical creeds and definition of the Trinity taught by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and Trinitarian Protestantism.\nIn their view, the New Testament prophesied that people would turn away from Christian teachings, and that there would be a restoration to the situation before the second coming of Christ.\nSome important differences with mainstream Christianity include: A belief that Jesus began his atonement from sin in the garden of Gethsemane and took on everyone's sins, Mormon or not. He bled from every pore, and prayed to his father in heaven, \"Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\" In their view, heaven is divided into three degrees of glory, and hell (often called outer darkness). Additionally, Mormons do not believe in creation ex nihilo, they believe that matter is eternal, and that God organizes existing matter.\nMuch of the Mormon belief system is oriented geographically around the North and South American continents. Mormons believe the people of the Book of Mormon lived in the western hemisphere, that Christ appeared in the western hemisphere after his death and resurrection, that the true faith was restored in upstate New York by Joseph Smith, and that the Garden of Eden and location of Christ's second coming were and will be in the state of Missouri. For this and other reasons, including a belief by many Mormons in American exceptionalism, Molly Worthen speculates that this may be why Leo Tolstoy described Mormonism as the \"quintessential 'American religion'\"."}

In the United States and parts of Canada, cider containing alcohol is called hard cider or alcoholic cider, while \"cider\" or \"apple cider\" means less-sweet, usually unfiltered, apple juice.\nIn the United States and Canada people drink a special kind of cider around Halloween and Thanksgiving. This cider is usually unfiltered, rather thick, and it is often heated and spiced with cinnamon before drinking it. This is different from the cider in Europe, which usually is not heated.\nHow cider is made.\nUsually to make cider, apples with a high concentration of tannins are chosen. The fermentation of the apples takes place at around 4-15\u00b0 Celsius. The temperature influences the duration of the fermentation. The temperature at which the fermentation occurs also has an effect on the taste of the cider.\nShortly before all the sugar has been fermented away, the cider is put in a new barrel which is made air-tight. The rest of the sugar will then become carbonic acid. This will also add to the life-span of the cider (no pasteurisation is needed).\nCider is also the starting-point for distilling Calvados. This alcoholic drink is famous and very expensive.\nWhere cider is made.\nCider is made almost anywhere where there are cider-apple trees, most notably\nIn France, Normandy is the first region as to the production of cider-apples (300 000 tonnes), and the first in cider production (7000 kilolitres).\nIn France, some ciders can benefit from a protected naming. This is the \"cidre normand\" and the \"cidre breton\".\nFrance is the country in the world that produces the biggest quantity of cider.\nThe United Kingdom produces the most varieties, and along with Ireland holds the biggest market for cider.\nKinds of cider.\nHard cider contains alcohol, which affects the taste of the cider. This can be influenced by choosing the right moment when to stop fermentation:\nIn France, the most popular are the first, second and fourth categories. In the English-speaking countries, it is possible to find cider with up to 12\u00b0 of alcohol.\nWhen to drink cider.\nThe French and Spanish cuisines have recipes where cider is needed to make them. The French and Spanish also often drink cider instead of wine made from grapes.\nIn Europe, many young people drink cider. Cider costs less than wine, and is often served in pubs and other places where young people go.\nThe effects of cider are the same as those of any alcoholic drink."}

As Prime Minister of Prussia from 1862 to 1890, he was most responsible for the uniting most of the many independent German countries into the new German Empire in 1871 and became its first chancellor.\nHe was \"Graf von Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen\" (Count Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen) in 1865. In 1871, he eas \"F\u00fcrst\" von Bismarck (Prince Bismarck). In 1890, he became the \"Herzog von Lauenburg\" (Duke of Lauenburg). At first, he did not want to become a duke, but he accepted the title later.\nUnification of Germany.\nIn the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that lasted until 1871 and unified most of the German states except Austria into a powerful German Empire, which was led by Prussia. He \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\".\nBismarck conducted wars against Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1871) to make Prussia more powerful. The Franco-Prussian War was very significant in the long run. France lost AlsaceLorraine during the German victory, led by the brilliant Helmuth von Moltke, and the war made Germany the most important country in Central Europe.\nAfter the death of Kaiser Wilhelm I and that of his son, Frederick III, who briefly replaced him in 1888, a new era began without Bismarck and Moltke, and Wilhelm II was now on the throne.\nPolicy at home.\nBismarck was very conservative, was strongly connected to the monarchy, and disliked democracy. His most important goal was to make Prussia stronger, and he did so by the unification of Germany. Bismarck tried to stop the rise of socialism and to reduce the power of the Catholic Church.\nOne way to stop socialism was to make the working class happy. He did so by introducing many social reforms like public health and accident insurance, as well as pensions for old people. Bismarck's pension scheme was the forerunner of the modern welfare state in Germany, and many other countries started similar systems."}
{"id": "14949", "revid": "7715434", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14949", "title": "Differential calculus", "text": "Differential calculus, a branch of calculus, is the study of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable, by using functions. It is a way to find out how a shape changes from one point to the next, without needing to divide the shape into an infinite number of pieces. Differential calculus is the opposite of integral calculus. It was developed in the 1670s and 1680s by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.\nBackground.\nUnlike a number such as 5 or 200, a variable can change its value. For example, distance and time are variables. At an Olympic running race, as the person runs, their \"distance\" from the starting line goes up. Meanwhile, a stopwatch or clock measures the \"time\" as it goes up. We can measure the average speed of the runner, if we divide the distance they travelled by the time it took. But this does not say what speed the person was running at exactly 1.5\u00a0seconds into the race. If we had the distance at 1\u00a0second and the distance at 2\u00a0seconds, we would still only have an average, although it would probably be more correct than the average for the whole race.\nUntil calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at exactly 1.5\u00a0seconds. This was a very long and hard process, and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out. Certainly it is much more difficult for a driver to figure out a car's speed by using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock\u2014without a speedometer.\nA very similar problem is to find the slope (how steep it is) at any point on a curve. The slope of a \"straight\" line is easy to work out\u2014it is simply how much it goes up (\"y\" or vertical) divided by how much it goes across (\"x\" or horizontal). If a line is parallel to the \"x\" axis, then its slope is zero. If a straight line went through (x,y) = (2,10) and (4,18), the line goes up 8 and goes across 2, so its slope is 8 divide 2, which is 4.\nOn a 'curve', though, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points), because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If it is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a tangent. But there is no way to know (without calculus) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.\nWhat Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly, by using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the point they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope \"approached\" a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope.\nHow it works.\nLet's say we have a function \"y\" = f(\"x\"). f is short for function, so this equation means \"y is a function of x\". This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x (the horizontal axis) is at that time. For example, with the equation \"y\" = \"x\"\u00b2, we know that if \"x\" is 1, then \"y\" will be 1; if \"x\" is 3, then \"y\" will be 9; if \"x\" is 20, then \"y\" will be 400.\nChoose a point A on the curve, and call its horizontal position \"x\". Then choose another point B on the curve which is a little bit farther across than A, and call its horizontal position \"x + h\". It does not matter how much \"h\" is; it is a very small number.\nSo when we go from point A to point B, the vertical position has gone from f(\"x\") to f(\"x + h\"), and the horizontal position has gone from \"x\" to \"x + h\". Now, remember that the slope is how much it goes up divided by how much it goes across. So the slope will be:\nformula_1\nIf you bring B closer and closer to A \u2013 which means \"h\" gets closer and closer to 0 \u2013 then we get closer to knowing what the slope is \"at\" the point A.\nformula_2\nNow let's go back to \"y\" = \"x\"\u00b2. The slope of this can be determined as follows:\nformula_3\nApplying the binomial theorem which states in part that formula_4, we can reduce the expression to:\nformula_5\nSo we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve \"f(x)\" = \"x\"\u00b2, the derivative \"f'(x)\" (marked with an apostrophe) will be 2\"x\" at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation, or finding the derivative.\nLeibniz came to the same result, but called h \"dx\", which means \"a tiny amount of x\". He called the resulting change in f(x) \"dy\", which means \"a tiny amount of y\". Leibniz's notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand, when the equations become more complicated. In Leibniz notation:\nformula_6\nRules.\nUsing the above system, mathematicians have worked out rules which work all the time, no matter which function is being looked at. (Note: here, formula_7 and formula_8 are both functions of formula_9)"}

The subfamily contains about 25 species in six or seven genera. They have become established as popular small house pets. They are a bit like a mouse. Wild hamsters live in the desert, but people all over the world keep domesticated hamsters as pets.\nIn the wild, hamsters are crepuscular and stay underground during the day. They feed on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and occasionally eat burrowing insects. Hamsters are distinguished by their large cheek pouches, and relatively short tail. They use their long cheek pouches (extending to their shoulders) to carry food back to their burrows.\nHamsters as pets.\nThere are six main types of hamsters: the Syrian hamster (the kind most people have as pets), winter whites, campbells, the Russian dwarf hamster (a hybrid of winter white and Campbell's dwarf hamsters), the Chinese hamster, and the Roborovski hamster. Unlike other species, the Chinese hamster has a long tail. All Syrian hamsters are the descendants of 12 baby hamsters found in Syria in 1930.\nPet hamsters should live in cages with wood shavings or recycled newspaper (pine or cedar shavings are toxic to hamsters). Plain toilet paper is also a cheap, safe option, but straw should only be given in small amounts. Hamsters eat mostly hamster food sold at a pet shop, but they can also eat many vegetables and fruits in small portions. Hamsters store food in natural pouches in the sides of their mouths.\nBecause they are rodents, hamster incisors grow constantly. They need wooden blocks and hard food to wear the teeth down and prevent them from getting too long. Most hamsters also have a wheel to run on for exercise. A 6\u00a0inch (15\u00a0cm) wheel is recommended for most dwarf hamsters, and at least an eight-inch (20\u00a0cm) wheel for Syrians. If the wheel is too small, the hamster's spine can become bent. Some people get other kinds of exercise equipment for their hamsters, like a \"hamster ball\" in which the hamster can roll around the floor (though these are not recommended by some animal welfare groups), or a long network of tubes with air holes for hamsters to crawl through. They should live in a tank or cage. Hamsters are not recommended for young children."}

A pocket watch is to be carried in a pocket. There are other variations. Nurses often wear a watch attached to the front of their uniform. It hangs down from a short strap: when lifted by the user it is right side up. \nA wrist watch has the advantage of being portable in comparison to traditional watches. \nWatches evolved in the 17th\u00a0century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th\u00a0century.

A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so it works as an oscillator. It resonates at a stable frequency, which paces a timekeeping mechanism.

Gein was found guilty of only two murders. Gein is considered by many to be even more well known because of several movies that were based in part on him. He was also known as The Butcher of Plainfield, The Plainfield Butcher, The Mad Butcher and The Plainfield Ghoul.\nEarly years.\nEd Gein and his brother Henry were raised by their mother on their 160-acre farm near Plainfield, Wisconsin. She was a very religious woman and was very protective about her boys. She kept them away from women and busy with farm work.\nHis alcoholic father died in 1940. A few years later his brother Henry died on May 16, 1944, officially while fighting a grass fire (though there was evidence he was murdered by Ed). Soon after that, his mother had her first stroke. In 1945 she had her second stroke and died. Ed was left alone.\nGein then closed off the upstairs and the parlour of the house as well as his mother\u2019s bedroom. He lived in the one other bedroom, kitchen and shed of the large house. He stopped working the farm because a government program paid him a subsidy. He also made money by doing small jobs for people in the area.\nThe Graveyard.\nEd read books on human anatomy and Nazi concentration camp experiments. He was very interested in it all, especially the female anatomy. His grave robbing began in 1947. One day he saw a newspaper article of a woman who had been buried that day. The first corpse came from a grave very near the grave of Gein\u2019s mother.[Indeed, one report is that among the first grave robbing incidents was that of his own mother ]\nGein continued to do this for the next ten years. He would check the newspaper often for fresh bodies. He always went to the graveyard at the time of a full moon. Gein would take the whole female corpse or just the parts he wanted, put the dirt back in the grave and take home what he took from the grave.\nGein did many strange things with the dead bodies. He would build objects from the bones and skin. The organs would be put into the refrigerator to eat later. It was claimed that he also had sex with the bodies (\"necrophilia\"), a charge he denied because they \"smelled too bad\".\nLater, Gein thought that fresher bodies would be better for his collection, and turned to murder.\nThe Murders.\nEd Gein\u2019s first victim was Mary Hogan, a 51-year-old divorcee and the owner of a local tavern in Pine Grove, six miles from his home. On the afternoon of December 8, 1954, he shot her in the head with his 32-caliber revolver. He put her body in his pickup truck and took her back to his shed.\nA customer who dropped into the tavern found the place deserted, and a large bloodstain on the floor. A spent .32 cartridge lay near it. Bloodstains ran out the back door and into the parking lot, where they halted beside tire tracks that looked like those of a pickup truck. It looked as if Mary Hogan had been shot and taken away.\nPolice were not able to learn anything about what happened to her. A few weeks later, a sawmill owner named Elmo Ueeck talked to Gein about it. Gein replied, \"She isn\u2019t missing, she\u2019s at the farm right now.\" Ueeck did not ask him what he meant by that.\nThere may have been other victims in the years that followed. Nothing is known for certain about Gein until November 16, 1957 when he shot &amp; killed Bernice Worden in her store in Plainfield. He used a .22 rifle from a rack in the store and his own bullet which he carried with him. He then locked the store and took the body home in the store\u2019s truck. Gein also took the cash register. He later explained that he did not take it to commit robbery. He wanted to see how it worked and planned to return it later.\nBernice Worden\u2019s son, Frank, often worked with her in the store. That morning he had gone deer hunting. When he got back, he saw that the store was closed with the lights still on and his mother was missing. He also saw that the cash register was gone and there was blood on the floor.\nFrank Worden talked to the sheriff, Art Schley and told him what he had seen. He checked the record of sales made that morning. One of them was for half a gallon of antifreeze. Worden remembered that Ed Gein had stopped by the night before at closing time. He had said that he would be back the next morning for antifreeze. Ed had also asked Worden if he was going hunting the next day.\nWith the cash register missing, he thought that Gein had planned a robbery once he learned Frank would not be there. Worden told this to the sheriff. The sheriff and captain Lloyd Schoephoester went to the farm, seven miles outside Plainfield.\nGein\u2019s home.\nThe house was dark and Ed Gein was not there when the police arrived. They drove to a store where Gein usually bought groceries where they found Gein, who was just about to leave in his truck.\nThe sheriff stopped him and asked him to get into the police car for questioning. Sheriff Schley had not said anything about Bernice Worden\u2019s death before Gein said that he thought someone had tried to frame him for the death, at which point Schley arrested Gein.\nSheriff Schley &amp; Captain Schoephoester went back to Gein's house with other officers. The doors to the house were locked, but the door to the shed behind the house was not. Inside they found a naked corpse of a woman hanging upside down from a crossbeam. The legs were spread wide apart and there was a long cut from the genitals almost to the throat. The throat and head were missing. The genitals and the anus were also missing. Bernice Worden had been cut open &amp; dressed out like a deer.\nThere was no electricity in the dark house. They had to search it with oil lamps, lanterns, and flashlights. The place looked like it had not been clean in years. The few rooms that were not nailed shut were full of books, old papers, magazines, utensils, tin cans, cartons and other junk.\nSearching the house, authorities found:\nThese artifacts were photographed at the state crime laboratory and then destroyed.\nWhen questioned, Gein told investigators that between 1947 and 1952, he made as many as 40 nocturnal visits to three local graveyards to exhume recently buried bodies while he was in a \"daze-like\" state. On about 30 of those visits, he said he came out of the daze while in the cemetery, left the grave in good order, and returned home empty-handed. On the other occasions, he dug up the graves of recently buried middle-aged women he thought resembled his mother and took the bodies home, where he tanned their skins to make his paraphernalia.\nGein admitted to stealing from nine graves of deceased women from two [three{?} ] local cemeteries and led investigators to their locations. Because authorities were uncertain as to whether the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening, they deceided to exhume test graves. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about two feet (60\u00a0cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. They were found as Gein described: One casket was empty, one Gein had failed to open when he lost his pry bar, and most of the body was gone from the third, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession.\nBesides the remains of Worden from the shed, the remains of Mary Hogan were the only other identified remains found in Geins House. The bodies of 15 different women had been used to create Gein\u2019s trophies. It is also said that sometimes Gein brought gifts of fresh venison to his neighbours but Gein said he had never shot a deer in his life.\nIn November 1957 burned remains of at least one woman were found in an ash pit behind Gein's house; the largest bone piece was three inches long.&lt;br&gt;Remains of another woman were found in a garbage pit\nIn 1995 on the site of the old Gein farm remains of 10 females and 1 male were found in an old well\nIt is not known for certain if there were other murders committed by Gein beyond the known deaths of Hogan and Worden-after his arrest a search of the house revealed newspaper clippings of murders of Wisconsin women whose killers had not been caught.\nBetween 1947 and 1957 there were several \"disappearences\" of persons at or near Plainfield, Wisconson:\nA 16-year-old youth, whose parents were friends of Gein and who attended ball games and movies with him, reported that Gein kept shrunken heads in his house, which Gein had described as relics from the Philippines, sent by a cousin who had served on the islands during World War II. Upon investigation by the police, these were determined to be human facial skins, carefully peeled from corpses and used by Gein as masks.\nDuring questioning, Waushara County sheriff Art Schley reportedly assaulted Gein by banging his head and face into a brick wall. As a result, Gein's initial confession was ruled inadmissible. Schley died of heart failure at age 43 in 1968, before Gein's trial. Many who knew Schley said he was traumatized by the horror of Gein's crimes, and this, along with the fear of having to testify (especially about assaulting Gein), caused his death. One of his friends said: \"He was a victim of Ed Gein as surely as if he had butchered him.\"\nGein was sent to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally insane. He was proven insane. The doctors thought that he loved his mother but he hated her, so that is why he killed older women. It is said that Mary Hogan looked similar to his mother.\nGein said he was not a cannibal or necrophiliac. He did admit grave robbing.\nMany people became interested because of the true nature of the crime. Thousands of people drove to Plainfield to look at the 'murder farm'. Eventually the place was burned down by person or persons unknown March 20, 1958 Plainfield citizens felt the old farmhouse was a place of evil. After the arson, an auction was held of the relics of the farm-the highest item sold was Gein's Ford \"death car\"\nAt Christmas, 1957, Gein was judged insane. In 1968, Gein was found guilty but legally insane of the murder of Worden, was committed to Waupan State Hospital for the rest of his life. Gein died of cancer in Madison, Wisconsin on July 26, 1984, at the age of 78. He was buried in Plainfield next to the graves of his family.\nThe movies.\nBecause of the true nature of Gein's crimes, Hollywood had a lot of ideas to work on.\nThe movie \"Psycho\" was based on the Robert Bloch book and made into a Hitchcock movie. Bloch got most of the ideas for \"Psycho\" from Gein's life. With the overpowering mother and horror of the movie, it was one of the first of a kind.\n\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" was based in some parts on Gein. The story is about a group of teenagers who go to a horror house. The people that live in the house are a family of strange homicidal cannibals who also like grave robbing and building furniture made of bones and skulls. The lead bad guy is called \u2018Leatherface\u2019. Leatherface likes chasing teens around with his chainsaw and wearing a mask made from the faces of his victims. The 1990 episode \"The Long Road Home\" of the fantasy horror series \"Friday the The 13th [The Series]\" is in homage to this movie.\nThe Academy Award-winning movie \"The Silence of the Lambs\" also uses part of Gein's life. It is about an FBI agent who is tracking down a serial killer. To find him she must get the help of an intelligent cannibal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The serial killer she is trying to catch is called \u2018Buffalo Bill\u2019. He likes to kill women and make clothes of their skin. He also wants to be a woman and made a skin costume like that of Gein."}

Christians believe that it is the holiest day in the year. Some people who are not Christians celebrate it as a cultural holiday.\nEaster is not held on the same date every year. This is called a \"moveable feast\". Currently all Christian churches agree on how the date is calculated. Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday following the first full moon which is on or after March 21st. This means it is celebrated in March or April. It can occur as early as March 22 and as late as April 11. Western churches, like the Roman Catholic Church, use the Gregorian calendar, while Eastern churches, like the Eastern Orthodox Church, use the Julian calendar. Because of this, the date of Easter celebrations is different for these two types of churches even though the way they calculate the date is similar. In 2015 Easter was celebrated on April 5 for both the Gregorian calendar and Julian calendar. In 2019 Easter was celebrated on the 21st of April.\nThe word \"Easter\" is derived from \"Eastra\", the name of the ancient German Goddess of Spring. Her festival occurred at the vernal equinox. The French word for Easter, \"P\u00e2cques\", comes from the Greek word for Passover, which is the Jewish holiday celebrated at about the same time of the year.\nImportance to Christians.\nJesus died roughly 2000 years ago in a city called Jerusalem (most of Jerusalem is in the modern country of Israel). The people who killed him did so because they believed that he was causing trouble for the government and because he was claiming to be the Messiah. When they crucified him (meaning they nailed him to a cross), they even hung a sign over his head, which said, \"King of the Jews.\" The day he was crucified is known by Christians as Good Friday.\nThe New Testament states that on the Sunday after Jesus was killed, his body was no longer in the tomb where he was laid. Later, Jesus is said to have appeared to over 500 people and preached to them. The New Testament teaches that the resurrection of Jesus is what Christianity is based on. The resurrection made people believe that Jesus was the powerful Son of God. It is also spoken of as proof that God will judge the world fairly. Christians believe that God has given Christians \"a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead\". Christians believe that through faith in God they are spiritually made alive with Jesus so that they may lead a new life.\nCustoms and traditions.\nEaster is celebrated in several ways in northern Europe and the United States. Most of these celebrations have nothing to do with the Christian meaning of the holiday. These celebrations are related more to the pagan festivals of ancient Germany. Children are given baskets to fill with candy. Eggs are decorated and hidden for children to find that the \"Easter Bunny\" supposedly laid. People wear new clothes and go to church. Greeting cards are exchanged. An Easter Egg Roll is held on the lawn of the White House on the day after Easter. Small leafless trees or branches are carried indoors and decorated with colored eggs, paper trims, and lights. Some shopping malls offer children a chance to visit with an adult costumed as the Easter Bunny. Forced tulips, hyacinths and lilies are given as gifts. Week-long vacations are taken following Easter Day, giving families the chance to visit with distant relatives. In America, many families leave the cold of northern states to visit amusement parks or sunny beaches in the south. Spring break for American high school and college students usually occurs about Easter time."}

Some people who call themselves \"agnostic\" say that it is not possible for anyone ever to know if there are any deities or not. Other agnostics, though, say only that they themselves currently do not know if there are any deities.\nThomas Henry Huxley, the English biologist, coined the word \"agnostic\" in 1869. In 1889 he wrote \"Agnosticism... is not a creed, but a method... the fundamental axiom of modern science... In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable\".\nThere are several different kinds of agnosticism:\nPeople often have difficulty telling agnosticism and atheism apart. Atheists do not believe in the existence of deities, and some say that they are sure that no deity exists. Some (perhaps most) atheists, though, say that it is up to theists (people who believe in a deity) to give the evidence for a god or to show why someone should believe in a god. They state that there is neither enough evidence nor a strong enough argument to believe any gods exist, and so they reject belief that any exist. While agnostics think we cannot \"know for sure\" whether any deities exist, some agnostics do \"believe\" at least one deity exists. These people are both agnostic and theistic\u2014they believe at least one deity exists, but do not claim to know that to be true.

It is on the coast of the Black Sea. During 1918-1921, and 1991-1995 its full name was the Republic of Georgia. Since 1995 it is Georgia as written in the Constitution. It was part of the Soviet Unionbetween 1921-1991, but now it is an independent republic. The capital city is Tbilisi. Its population is almost 4 million.\nHistory.\nThe Georgians are an ancient people. Their capital Tbilisi was founded around AD 400, by the king . Western Georgia was part of the Roman Empire before then. The Arabs captured it in 635\u00a0AD. The culture continued and they flourished through trade.\nIn the 900s Arabs influence diminished in Caucasia significantly. In 1008 Kingdom of Georgia was formed. It was the major country in the region until the Mongols invaded in 1223. Georgia was part of the Mongolian empire for a century on and off until 1334, when King Giorgi V took over. In the 1400s Georgia dissolved into several principalities. In the 1500s the Persians invaded Eastern Georgia four times from 1541-1544. In 1555 the Kings of Kartli ruled through the will of the Persian Shahs.\nIn 1783 The treaty of Georgievsk was signed between Catherine the Great of Russia and King Heraclius II, giving Russia the power to protect Georgia. Then, in 1798 the Persians burned Tbilisi to the ground.\nFrom 1811 to 1918 Georgia was under the Tsar of Russia. Their culture survived intact. From 1918 to 1921 Georgia was independent, and then was part of the Soviet Union.\nIn 1991 most people from Georgia voted to be a free nation again, and Georgia declared their independence from the Soviet Union. Newly established Republic of Georgia saw bloody Civil War resulting in downfall of first-ever president of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Georgia was also involved in War in Abkhazia. There was a rough patch between 1994 and 1995 when the economy was poor, although Georgia saw significant improvements in last few years. Now Georgia is applying to NATO and European Union.\nIn 2008 Georgia was involved in the 2008 South Ossetia war.\nGeography.\nGeorgia is next to the countries of Russia, Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It also has a coast on the Black Sea. It is at the edge of Europe and Asia.\nGeorgia has many mountains. Its highest point is 5,193\u00a0m above sea level. The mountains running through Georgia are called the Caucasus Mountains.\nThe highest mountain in Georgia is Mount Shkhara at 5,193\u00a0m. The coastline of Georgia is 310\u00a0km long. Georgia has about 25,000 rivers. The largest river is the Mtkvari.\nDivisions.\nGeorgia is divided into 9 regions, 1 city, and 2 autonomous republics. These in turn are divided into 67 districts and 12 self-governing cities. \nThe region of Abkhazia declared independence in 1999. South Ossetia is officially known by Georgia as the Tskinvali region. Georgia considers both regions as occupied by Russia.\nCulture.\nThe population of Georgia is about 4 million. About 1.2 million of these live in Tbilisi. People from Georgia are called Georgians. Most of them speak Georgian as their first language, though some people also speak Azerbaijani, Armenian, Russian or other languages.\nGeorgians have their own unique three alphabets. They were invented by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia.\nThe most famous person to have come from Georgia is Josef Stalin.\nMost Georgians are Christians, but there are some Muslims and Jews as well.\nThe currency of Georgia is called the \"Lari.\""}

Data (information) in the RAM can be read and written quickly in any order. Normally, the random access memory is in the form of computer chips. Usually, the contents of RAM are accessible faster than other types of information storage.However, RAM is volatile, which means that every time the computer is turned off, all the data in the RAM is lost. The alternative to this, Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM), keeps its data without using power, is more expensive but works slower, so it is used in smaller amounts. \nSince the late 20th century, RAM uses transistors, usually MOSFETs, to store data. Before that, magnetic memory was the usual kind.\nDifferent types of RAM.\nDynamic random access memory (DRAM) is the majority in computers. Modern computers use several types of DRAM. Before 2002, most computers used single data rate (SDR) RAM. Most computers made since then use either double data rate (DDR), DDR2, DDR3, or RAM. The later types allow stored data to be moved and used more quickly, so that the computer's processor can keep working quickly without having to wait for data as long or as often. \nDifferent kinds of RAM usually will not work together in the same computer. Most computers can only use one kind of RAM. Some can use a small number of different kinds. Different kinds of RAM often have differently shaped connectors. This limits which RAM chips a particular computer model can use.\nStatic RAM (SRAM) needs power to keep its data, but does not need the computer to be active. Some SRAM chips are battery-backed. This type has a built-in battery to make sure no data is lost if the computer is turned off. Some computers have a little SRAM and mostly DRAM.\nOther uses for RAM.\nRAM is usually used to store information of running programs inside computers. RAM may also be used for different things.\nVirtual Memory.\nUsing virtual memory, a computer can combine permanent storage with RAM to create a bigger pool of storage. This is useful when the RAM does not have enough space to store anymore information. The extra data is then placed in the permanent storage instead of the RAM. The method has a limitation which is that permanent storage is often slower than RAM, which can slow down a computer.\nRAM disk.\nA computer can use a part of the RAM to store permanent files. This is called a RAM disk. When the computer is turned on, files are copied to the RAM disk. This allows the files to open faster because RAM is faster than permanent storage. When the computer is turned off, the information on the RAM disk is lost, which is why the files need to exist on permanent storage as well.\nOther kinds of memory.\nInformation that the computer always needs, that cannot be changed or deleted (unless it is EEPROM), is normally kept in read-only memory (ROM), which does not lose its contents when the computer is turned off. Such items include the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which stores the most basic commands for the computer, telling it how it should start up. The BIOS also tells the computer how to input and output information. The BIOS can be compared to the part of your brain that tells your heart how to beat. This is an important part."}

Silicon chips can contain logic gates, computer processors, memory and special devices. The chip is very fragile and so is normally surrounded by a plastic package to protect it. Electrical contact with the chip is provided through tiny wires that connect the chip to larger metal pins that stick out of the package.\nAn IC has two main advantages over discrete circuits: cost and performance. Cost is low, because millions of transistors can be put onto one chip instead of building a circuit with single transistors. Performance is higher since the components can operate more quickly and use less power.\nICs are designed for different purposes. A chip may be designed just for a calculator, which can only work as a calculator. Integrated circuits can be classified into analog, digital and mixed signal (both analog and digital on the same chip).\nSemiconductor.\nA semiconductor such as silicon can be controlled to allow (or not allow) current to flow. This allows making transistors that can control each other. They are found in many household items such as radios, computers, and telephones, and many others. Other semiconductor devices include solar cells, diodes, and LEDs (light emitting diodes).\nInvention.\nIn 1958 and 1959, two people had the idea for an integrated circuit at almost exactly the same time. Transistors had become an everyday thing used in household devices such as radios. They affected everything from radios to phones and at the time manufacturers needed a smaller replacement for vacuum tubes. Transistors were smaller than vacuum tubes, but for some of the newest electronics, for example missile guidance, they were not small enough. \nOne day in July, Jack Kilby was working at Texas Instruments when it occurred to him that all parts of a circuit, not just the transistor, could be made out of silicon. At the time, nobody was putting capacitors and resistors into ICs. This would change the future and make it easier to produce and sell integrated circuits. Kilby's boss liked the idea, and told him to get to work. By September 12, Kilby had built a working model, and on February 6, Texas Instruments filed a patent. Their first \"Solid Circuit\" was the size of a fingertip. \nMeanwhile, in California, another man had the same idea. In January of 1959, Robert Noyce was working at the small Fairchild Semiconductor startup company. He also realized a whole circuit could be put into a single chip. While Kilby had worked out the details of making individual components, Noyce thought of a much better way to connect the parts. The design was called a \"\"unitary circuit\".\" All that detail paid off because on April 25, 1961, the patent office awarded the first patent for an integrated circuit to Robert Noyce while Kilby's application was still being analyzed. Today, both men are acknowledged as having independently conceived of the idea.\nSoon there were two kinds of integrated circuit: hybrid (HIC) and monolithic (MIC). Hybrids died out late in the 20th century.\nGenerations.\n\u203b The difference between VLSI and ULSI is not well defined.\nClassification.\nIntegrated circuits can be packaged as DIP (Dual in-line package), PLCC (Plastic leaded chip carrier), TSOP (Thin small-outline package), PQFP (Plastic Quad Flat Pack) and other chip package types. Some small ones are packaged for surface-mount technology. The transistors inside can be bipolar transistors in unusual circuits, such as those needing very high switching speeds. Most, however, are MOSFETs."}

Mosses evolved from liverworts.p75\nMoss tissue does not have cells that move water. This means that they are non-vascular plants. Water must soak into mosses like a sponge. A patch of moss is made of many tiny moss plants packed together so that they can hold water for as long as possible. They do not have roots. Because mosses cannot find water, they live in two ways. They can live in places that are always wet like near a spring, a river, or in a place where there is a lot of fog or has a lot of rainfall. They can also pause their natural processes when they dry up. Mosses can survive months in this paused state. However, they eventually need water to live. This means they can never live in dry places like deserts.\nMosses cannot grow very large because they could not move water to the top of their growth. The largest moss grows in New Zealand. It is about 30\u00a0cm tall.\nA moss does not make seeds. A moss does not have fruit. The green fuzzy part of a moss that is always there has only one set of DNA. Moss waits until there is lots of food and enough water. Then it produces spores that leave the parent plant and float away. The spores are like dust. They will make more moss. Each spore is male or female. It grows into the green fuzzy part of the moss called the gametophyte. Male gametophyte make sperm. Female gametophyte make eggs. Water moves the sperm from the male moss to the female moss. Then the sperm and the egg join to make a cell with two sets of moss DNA. This cell grows into a different shape called a sporophyte. The sporophyte gets all of its food from the green fuzzy female gametophyte. When the sporophyte grows up, it makes a tiny box with spores inside instead of seeds. The lid on the box falls and the spores float away to repeat the cycle again. This process is called alternation of generations.\nScientists divide the mosses into eight groups. Five of these groups are small, with just a few species; most mosses are in the group called Bryopsida."}

The set of all values that \"x\" can have is called the \"domain\", and the set that contains every value that \"y\" can have is called the \"codomain\". A function is often denoted by italic letters such as formula_1, formula_2, formula_3.\nIf this happens, then we say that \"y\" is a function of \"x\", and we write formula_4. Here, formula_1 is the name of the function, and one writes formula_6 (function from X to Y) to represent the three parts of the function: the domain (\"X\"), the codomain (\"Y\"), and the pairing process (the arrow).\nAn example of a function is formula_7. One gives a natural number formula_8 as the input, and gets a natural number formula_9, which is formula_10. For example, giving 3 as input to formula_1 results in an output of 4. \nA function doesn't have to be an equation. The main idea is that inputs and outputs are paired up somehow\u2014even if the process might be very complicated.\nMetaphors.\nTables.\nThe inputs and outputs can be put in a table like the picture; this is easy if there is not too much data.\nGraphs.\nIn the picture, one can see that both 2 and 3 have been paired with c; this is not allowed in the other direction, as 2 could not output c and d at the same time (each input can only have one output).\nAll of the formula_12 (c and d in the picture) are usually called the \"image\" set of formula_1, and the image set can be the entire codomain or one of its subset. One can say that the image set of a subset A of the domain is f(A).\nIf the inputs and outputs have an order, then it is easy to plot them on a graph:\nHistory.\nIn the 1690s, Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli used the word \"function\" in letters between them, so the modern concept began at the same time as calculus.\nIn 1748, Leonhard Euler gave the following definition for function:\"A function of a variable quantity is an analytic expression composed in any way whatsoever of the variable quantity and numbers or constant quantities.\"and then in 1755:\"If some quantities so depend on other quantities that if the latter are changed the former undergoes change, then the former quantities are called functions of the latter. This definition applies rather widely and includes all ways in which one quantity could be determined by other. If, therefore, x denotes a variable quantity, then all quantities which depend upon x in any way, or are determined by it, are called functions of x.\"Usually, Peter Dirichlet is credited with the first modern definition of function (formulated in 1837). It is often used in schools until the second half of the 20th century:\"y is a function of a variable x, defined on the interval a &lt; x &lt; b, if to every value of the variable x in this interval there corresponds a definite value of the variable y. Also, it is irrelevant in what way this correspondence is established.\"In 1939, the Bourbaki generalized the Dirichlet definition, and gave a set-theoretic version of the definition as a correspondence between inputs and outputs; this was used in schools from about 1960.\nFinally in 1970, Bourbaki gave the modern definition as a triple formula_14, with formula_15 (i.e. formula_16 and formula_17).\n is called the \"domain\" of , its \"codomain\", and its \"graph\". The set of all elements of the form , where ranges over the elements of the domain , is called the \"image\" of . The image of a function is a subset of its codomain so it might not coincide with it."}

Many cubans migrated to Miami after Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, and the population rapidly increased. The majority of these Cuban immigrants now live in Little Havana.\nDuring the 1980s, Miami was a primary location for drug trafficking from South America, mainly Colombia.

His church was called the \"People's Temple\". It began as a Christian church (a member church of the Disciples of Christ), but over time became a cult. Jones and most of the members of his group died on November 18, 1978 in Guyana. Jones died when he shot himself on that day after forcing most of the members of his group to drink poison.\nVisit by Congressman Ryan, murders.\nIn November 1978, U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan led a fact-finding mission to Jonestown to investigate allegations of human rights abuses. Ryan's delegation included relatives of Temple members, Don Harris, an NBC network news reporter, an NBC cameraman and reporters for various newspapers. The group arrived in Georgetown on November 15. On November 17, Ryan's delegation traveled by airplane to Jonestown.\nThe delegation left hurriedly the afternoon of November 18 after Temple member Don Sly attacked Ryan with a knife. The attack was thwarted, and the visit ended. Congressman Ryan and his people took with them fifteen People's Temple members who had expressed a wish to leave. At that time, Jones made no attempt to prevent their departure.\nPort Kaituma Airstrip shootings.\nAs members of Ryan's delegation boarded two planes at the airstrip, Jones' \"Red Brigade\" armed guards arrived in a tractor-pulled trailer and began shooting at the delegation. The guards killed Congressman Ryan and four others near a twin engine Otter aircraft. At the same time, one of the supposed defectors, Larry Layton, drew a weapon and began firing on members of the party that had already boarded a small Cessna. An NBC cameraman was able to capture footage of the first few seconds of the shooting at the Otter. The five killed at the airstrip were Congressman Ryan; Don Harris, a reporter from NBC; Bob Brown, a cameraman from NBC; San Francisco Examiner photographer Greg Robinson; and Temple member Patricia Parks. Surviving the attack were future Congresswoman Jackie Speier, then a staff member for Ryan; Richard Dwyer, the Deputy Chief of Mission from the U.S. Embassy at Georgetown; Bob Flick, a producer for NBC News; Steve Sung, an NBC sound engineer; Tim Reiterman, a \"San Francisco Examiner\" reporter; Ron Javers, a \"San Francisco Chronicle\" reporter; Charles Krause, a \"Washington Post\" reporter; and several defecting Temple members.&lt;\nDeaths in Jonestown.\nLater that same day, 909 inhabitants of Jonestown, 303 of them children, died of apparent cyanide poisoning, in and around a pavilion. This was the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the September 11, 2001 attacks. No video was taken during the mass suicide, though the FBI did recover a 45-minute audio recording of the suicide in progress.\nOn that tape, Jones tells Temple members that the Soviet Union, with whom the Temple had been negotiating a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the Temple had murdered Ryan and four others at a nearby airstrip. The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would \"parachute in here on us,\" \"shoot some of our innocent babies\" and \"they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors\". Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism, one temple member states \"the ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies\".\nJones and several members argued that the group should commit \"revolutionary suicide\" by drinking cyanide-laced grape-flavored Flavor Aid. However, later released video made to show the best of Jonestown shows Jones opening a storage container full of Kool-Aid in large quantities. This may have been what was used to mix the \"potion\" (as was referred to in several statements on the tape recordings) along with a sedative.\nOne member, Christine Miller, dissents toward the beginning of the tape. When members apparently cried, Jones counseled, \"Stop this hysterics. This is not the way for people who are Socialists or Communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity\". Jones can be heard saying, \"Don't be afraid to die,\" that death is \"just stepping over into another plane\" and that it's \"a friend\". At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: \"We didn't commit suicide; we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world\". According to escaping Temple members, children were given the drink first and families were told to lie down together. Mass suicide had been previously discussed in simulated events called \"White Nights\" on a regular basis.\nJones was found dead in a deck chair with a gunshot wound to his head that Guyanese coroner Cyrill Mootoo stated was consistent with a self-inflicted gun wound. However, Jones' son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him. An autopsy of Jones' body also showed levels of the barbiturate Pentobarbital which may have been lethal to humans who had not developed physiological tolerance. Jones' drug usage (including LSD and marijuana) was confirmed by his son, Stephan, and Jones' doctor in San Francisco."}

Its official name is The State of Eritrea. \nGeography.\nEritrea is located on the coast of the Red Sea. It is north of the Bab-el-Mandeb and the Horn of Africa. Eritrea has borders with the countries of Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. The land area of Eritrea is 101,000\u00a0km\u00b2, and it is one of the smallest countries in Africa.\nHistory.\nEritrea became an independent country on May 24, 1993. It is one of the newest countries in the world.\nMany different countries have ruled the land that is now called Eritrea. Between 1885 and 1941 it was a colony of Italy. Between 1941 and 1952, the United Nations put it under the protection of the United Kingdom. After 1952, Eritrea became a part of Ethiopia. This was the reason for a long civil war between the Eritreans and the government of Ethiopia.\nEventually, in 1993, Eritrea became an independent country after a vote by its people.\nEritreans.\nEritreans are the native inhabitants of Eritrea, as well as the global diaspora of Eritreans displaced by the Eritrean War of Independence and seeking refuge from human rights violations by the Eritrean government. Eritreans constitute several component ethnic groups, many of which are closely related to ethnic groups in Ethiopia and other parts of the Horn of Africa.\nThe Eritrean national identity began to develop during the Scramble for Africa, when Italy claimed Eritrea as one of its colonies. This marked the establishment of Eritrea's present-day borders. Following Italy's defeat in World War II and the subsequent British administration of Eritrea, the former colony was federated with Ethiopia in 1952. Tensions increased through the 1950s between Eritreans wishing for independence and the Ethiopian government, culminating in the Eritrean War of Independence.\nComponent Ethnicities.\nTigrinya.\nThe majority of the Tigrinya inhabit the highlands of Eritrea; however, migration to other parts of the country has occurred. Their language is called Tigrinya. They are the largest ethnic group in the country, constituting about 60% of the population. The predominantly Tigrinya populated urban centers in Eritrea are the capital Asmara, Mendefera, Dekemhare, Adi Keyh, Adi Quala and Senafe, while there is a significant population of Tigrinya in other cities including Keren, and Massawa.\nThey are 96% Christians, (of which 90% are of the Eritrean Orthodox faith, 5% Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic (whose mass is held in Ge'ez as opposed to Latin), and 5% belonging to various Protestant and other Christian denominations, the majority of which belong to the (Lutheran) Evangelical Church of Eritrea).\nTigre.\nThe Tigre reside in the western lowlands in Eritrea. Many also migrated to Sudan at the time of the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict and lived there since. They are a nomadic and pastoralist people, related to the Tigrinya and to the Beja people. They are a predominantly Muslim nomadic people who inhabit the northern, western, and coastal lowlands of Eritrea, where they constitute 30% of local residents. Some also inhabit areas in eastern Sudan. 95% of the Tigre people adhere to the Islamic religion Sunni Islam, but there are a small number of Christians among them as well (often referred to as the Mensa\u00ef in Eritrea). Their language is called Tigre.\nJeberti.\nThe Jeberti people in Eritrea trace descent from early Muslim adherents. The term \"Jeberti\" is also locally sometimes used to generically refer to all Islamic inhabitants of the highlands. The Jeberti in Eritrea speak Arabic and Tigrinya. They account for about 4% of the Tigrinya speakers in the nation.\nAfar.\nAccording to the CIA, the Afar constitute under 5% of the nation's population. They live in the Debubawi Keyih Bahri Region of Eritrea, as well as the Afar Region in Ethiopia, and Djibouti. They speak the Afar language as a mother tongue, and are predominantly Muslim. Afars in Eritrea number about 397,000 individuals, the smallest population out of the countries they reside in. In Djibouti, there are about 780,000 group members, and in Ethiopia, they number approximately 1,300,000.\nSaho.\nThe Saho represent 4% of Eritrea's population. They principally reside in the Debubawi Keyih Bahri Region and the Northern Red Sea Region of Eritrea. Their language is called Saho. They are predominantly Muslim, although a few Christians known as the Irob live in the Debub Region of Eritrea and the Tigray region of Ethiopia.\nBilen.\nThe Bilen in Eritrea represent around 2% of the country's population. They are primarily concentrated in the north-central areas, in and around the city of Keren, and south towards Asmara, the nation's capital. Many of them entered Eritrea from Kush (central Sudan) in the 8th century and settled at Merara, after which they went to Lalibela and Lasta. The Bilen then returned to Axum in Ethiopia's Tigray Province, and battled with the natives; in the resulting aftermath, the Bilen returned to their main base at Merara. The Bilen include adherents of both Islam and Christianity. They speak the Bilen as a mother tongue. Christian adherents are mainly urban and have intermingled with the Tigrinya who live in the area. Muslim adherents are mainly rural and have interbred with the adjacent Tigre.\nBeja.\nThe Beja in Eritrea, or Hedareb, constitute under 5% of local residents. They mainly live along the north-western border with Sudan. Group members are predominantly Muslim and communicate in Hedareb as a first or second language. The Beja also include the Beni-Amer people, who have retained their native Beja language alongside Hedareb.\nKunama.\nAccording to the CIA, the Kunama constitute around 2% of Eritrea's population. They mainly live in the country's Gash Barka Region, as well as in adjacent parts of Ethiopia's Tigray Region. Many of them reside in the contested border village of Badme. Their language is called Kunama. Although some Kunama still practice traditional beliefs, most are converts to either Christianity (Roman Catholic and Protestant) or Islam.\nNara.\nThe Nara represent under 5% of the nation's population. They principally reside along the south-western border with Sudan and Ethiopia. They are generally Muslim, with a few Christians and some practising their indigenous beliefs. Their language is called Nara.\nRashaida Arabs in Eritrean.\nThe Rashaida are one of Eritrea's nine recognized ethnic groups. They represent around 2% of the population of Eritrea. The Rashaida reside in the northern coastal lowlands of Eritrea and the northern eastern coasts of Sudan. They are predominantly Muslim and are the only ethnic group in Eritrea to have Arabic as their communal language, specifically the Hejazi dialect. The Rashaida first came to Eritrea in the 19th century from the Arabian Coast.\nItalians in Eritrea.\nA few monolingual Italian Eritreans remain. As of 2008, they were estimated at 900 people, down from around 38,000 residents at the end of World War II.\nGovernment.\nEritrea is known for being the most oppressive country in Africa, sometimes considered to be the \"North Korea of Africa\". The nation has been accused of many human rights violations, severely limited freedoms, and many arbitrary (made-up) arrests.\nAdministrative divisions.\nEritrea is divided into six administrative regions. These areas are then divided into 58 districts.\nCulture.\nThe population of Eritrea is about 3.6\u00a0million. About 0.5\u00a0million people live in Asmara. People from Eritrea are called Eritreans. Most of them speak \"Tigrinya\" or \"Tigre\" as their first language. The people usually use Tigrinya or Arabic for official business.\nEritrea has nine ethnic groups. These are the Afar people, the Bilen people, the Hedareb people, the Kunama, the Nara, the Rashaida, the Saho, the Tigre, and Tigray-Tigrinya.\nThe currency of Eritrea is called the Nakfa. Eritrea is a very poor country. Almost half of Eritrea's economy comes from Eritreans who live abroad. They send money home to their families. Most of the rest comes from farming.\nFootball and cycling are the most popular sports in Eritrea. In recent years, Eritrean athletes have also seen increasing success in the international arena."}

{"id": "15034", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15034", "title": "Ancient Egypt", "text": "Ancient Egypt, or the Kingdom of Kemet, was a society that began about 3150 BC, and lasted until 20 BC when it was invaded by the Roman Empire.\nEgypt grew along the River Nile and was at its most powerful in the second millennium BC. Its land went from the Nile delta to Nubia, a kingdom which today is mostly in the Sudan.\nFor most of its history, Egypt was prosperous, since the water from the Nile made sure that the Egyptians would have good crops. Crops were grown after the Nile flood water went down.\nThe Egyptians created a way of writing using hieroglyphs, built huge temples and tombs, traded with other areas, and had a powerful army. Their religion had many gods, and its priests were powerful and rich. Their rulers, called Pharaohs, were thought to be close to the gods.\nHistory.\nArchaeologists, who study objects left by ancient people, have found that people have lived along the Nile for a very long time. The fertile flood plains of the Nile allowed people to begin farming. By the 10th millennium BC, the people in Egypt had begun growing cereal grains like wheat and barley. Because they were farming, they stayed in one place, and because they were settled, their society became more complex. This was an important step in the history of human civilization.\nThis period in Egyptian history is called \"predynastic\", as it happened before the large dynastic kingdoms were formed.\nBy about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of cultures. Each had begun farming crops and animals. Each had their own types of pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. In Upper Egypt, the south part of the country, the Badarian was one of the earliest cultures. It is known for its high quality pottery, stone tools, and its use of copper. They were followed by the Amratian and Gerzian cultures.\nThe different periods of ancient Egyptian history are:\nThe Intermediate periods included times when the traditional system broke down, the country was split, or invaded by foreign rulers. Egypt's culture and climate was relatively stable, compared to other parts of the Middle East. Nevertheless, they had some periods when their government was challenged and sometimes overthrown.\nGovernment.\nAncient Egypt was split up into many different districts called \"sepats\". The first divisions were created during the Predynastic Period, but then, they were small city-states that ruled themselves. When the first pharaoh came to power, the sepats remained and were much like the counties in many countries today. They stayed basically the same for a long time \u2013 there were 42 of them, and each was ruled by a governor chosen by the pharaoh. In later years the districts were called nomes and the governor was called a nomarch.\nAncient Egypt had a lot of different taxes, but there was no real money, so people paid each other with goods or work. The person who watched the tax collection was a \"scribe\", and every tax collector in Egypt had to tell him every day how many taxes they had collected. Each person paid different taxes based on the work that they did: craftsmen paid in goods, hunters and fishermen paid with food, and every single household in the country had to pay a labour tax every year by helping with work for the country like mining or for canals. A lot of rich Egyptians paid poorer people to do this for them.\nLanguage and writing.\nLanguage.\nThe language can be divided into six time periods:\nWriting.\nHieroglyphics.\nEgypt had writing called hieroglyphics, which is one of the two oldest written languages (the other is Sumerian cuneiform). \nHieroglyphic writing dates to c. 3200\u00a0BC, and is composed of some 500 symbols. A hieroglyph represents a word, a sound, or a symbol to show what the sign means. The same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs on stone monuments and in tombs were for public purposes. It was art, and often it was propaganda.\nHieratic script.\nThe script used by priests for everyday writing on \"papyrus\", wood or cloth.\nIn day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows.\nDemotic script.\nThe script used by ordinary people. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the main writing style. It is this form of writing and formal hieroglyphs which accompanies the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.\nCoptic script.\nThe Coptic script is a modified Greek alphabet. The Coptic language is the last stage of the Egyptian language (modern Egyptians speak a dialect of Arabic).\nLiterature.\nSome ancient Egyptian literature has survived to the present day. There are teaching texts, such as the \"Maxims of Ptahhotep\", the \"Instructions of Amenemope\", and the Ebers papyrus. The Ebers papyrus is one of the earliest medical texts ever found.\nThere are also poems and stories. \nReligion.\nReligion was very important to Ancient Egyptians. To Egyptians, animals were holy and were worshipped. Because of this, Egyptians domesticated, or made pets of, animals very early and took very good care of them. The centre of any Egyptian town was the temple, and this building was used for everything from the town hall to a university in addition to its religious services.\nBecause they were so religious, Egyptians created a lot of art of their gods. This art shows all different kinds of divine, or holy, creatures including the pharaoh, who was thought to be a god.\nThe afterlife was also very important to Egyptians and they are known for mummifying their dead. These mummies are important to scientists today because they tell them about how the Egyptians lived.\nAll the gods were important but some were more important than others. An example of a goddess is Isis who is the goddess of the sky. Another example of a major god is Ra who was the god of the sun. The less well known god of The Nile and the crocodiles was named Sobek, which is a rather unusual name. Bastet was the goddess of cats, so the Ancient Egyptians mummified cats in honour of her, she was also the goddess of protection, joy and families.\nAgriculture.\nThe rich fertile soil came from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. In ancient Egypt taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.\nFarming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: \"Akhet\" (flooding), \"Peret\" (planting), and \"Shemu\" (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the \"growing season\" lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.p514 From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.p506\nFlax plants were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.p577; 630\nMost animals were kept as food. Some animals were kept as pets. All kinds of animals were important to Egypt. Ancient Egyptians understood the animals. Animals they kept were goats, pigs, ducks, cows and geese.\nMedicine.\nAncient Egyptians had some advanced medical knowledge for their time. They performed surgery, set broken bones and even knew about medicines. Some medicines the Ancient Egyptians used are honey and breast milk or gazelle's milk. Not only did they have medicinal values, they also are believed to have been used to ward off evil spirits and demons. The easiest way to see how good they were at medicine is to look at the medical papyri which have survived to the present day. The Edwin Smith papyrus is the world's oldest surviving surgical document, from about 1600 B.C. The text describes anatomy, and the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of 48 types of medical problems in detail.\nPyramids.\nAncient Egyptian pyramids are shaped stone masonry structures. They are the best known pyramid structures, and are some of the largest ever buildings. Over 130 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt. Most were built on the western side of the River Nile in desert areas. Egyptian pyramids are often contain chambers and passages. The pyramids were built as the burial places of the Egyptian kings before the start of the old kingdom until the end of the middle kingdom. Because the Egyptians kept written records, we know about the building of some pyramids.\nThe Great Pyramid at Giza is the largest and most famous pyramid. It was built for Pharaoh Khufu. It is over 140 metres high and took 20 years to build. It is listed as one of the seven wonders of the world. The step pyramid at Saqqara is the earliest pyramid which is still standing today. This was built in 2630 BC. It was a burial place of the Pharaoh Djoser. The architect of the step pyramid was Imhotep.\nOther achievements.\nEngineering was an important activity in Egypt. Engineers were able to measure and survey the distance between two points. They designed and made the pyramids, which are nearly perfect geometrically. They could make cement, and developed large irrigation networks.\nScience was also important. Mathematics was used in Egypt, and the golden ratio was used in the construction of the Pyramids.\nAnother ability of the Egyptians was glass making. Archaeologists have found many pieces of beads, jars, figures and ornaments in tombs across the nation. In 2005, the remains of an ancient glassmaking factory was found."}

He was one of the greatest military leaders of all time. He was born in 356 BC in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia.\nAlexander was the son of Philip II, King of Macedonia, and Olympias, the princess of neighboring Epirus. Alexander spent his childhood watching his father turn Macedonia into a great military power, and watching him win victory on the battlefields in the Balkans. \nAlexander the Great spoke the Greek language. He worshiped the Greek gods and also spread the Greek culture through out Asia.\nWhen he was 13, Philip hired the Greek philosopher Aristotle to be Alexander\u2019s personal tutor. During the next three years, Aristotle gave Alexander a training in rhetoric and literature, and stimulated his interest in science, medicine, and philosophy, all of which became important in Alexander\u2019s later life.\nAlexander's war.\nIn 340\u00a0BC, Philip assembled a large Greek army and invaded Thrace. He left 16 year old Alexander with the power to rule Greece in his absence as regent. But as the Macedonian army advanced deep into Thrace, the Thracian tribe of Maedi bordering north-eastern Macedonia rebelled and posed a danger to the country. Alexander assembled an army, led it against the rebels, and with swift action defeated the Maedi, captured their stronghold, and renamed it Alexandroupolis.\nAlexander became king of Macedonia in 336\u00a0BC when his father was assassinated. A meeting was held to the Greek cities made him \"strategos\" (General or supreme commander). He used this authority to launch his father's military expansion plans. In 334\u00a0BC, he invaded Persian-ruled Asia Minor. He began series of campaigns that lasted ten years. Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He overthrew the Persian King Darius III and conquered the entire Persian Empire. He married the king's daughter to symbolize the unity of his new empire. At that point, Alexander's empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River.\nHe attacked the subcontinent in 326\u00a0BC, and defeated\u00a0King Porus, who ruled a region in the\u00a0Punjab. Afterwards they became allies. India at that time was divided into hundreds of kingdoms. The army refused to cross the Indus and fight the kings on the other side, so Alexander led them out of Pakistan.\nAlexander died in Babylon in 323\u00a0BC, of unknown causes. Poison, murder, or a fever after a battle have all been suggested. At his death, he was planning a series of campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart. Several states were then ruled by the Diadochi, Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. They fought and conquered each other. The largest surviving piece was the Seleucid Empire.\nAlexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion of Greek ideas and language. He started some twenty cities that were named after him, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Macedonian colonists resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization. Signs of this can be seen in the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD. There were Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s.\nAlexander died from Malaria when he was only 32 years old. He was never defeated in battle."}

The word \"lanai\" is also used in English. (That is different from \"Lanai\", the name of one of Hawaii's islands.)\nRelated languages.\nThere are related languages in the Marquesas, Raratonga, Samoa, some islands of what is now Fiji and New Zealand. Their languages have changed a lot over the last two thousand years or so. However, native speakers of all these languages can still understand each other.\nLetters.\nThe language has only 12 letters (A, E, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, U, W). There are 13 if you count the okina. The okina is a real letter and came from some \"K\" sounds in old Polynesian languages. The okina is pronounced as a glottal stop, like the break in the middle of the word \"Uh-oh\". The okina is written as a backward apostrophe (small numeral 6 above and before a vowel).\nDialects.\nThe Niihau dialect still uses some T, S, R and \"hints\" of B sounds. People who live on that island are the only people who still speak Hawaiian only and their dialect is the truest to its roots.\nSyllables.\nEvery Hawaiian syllable ends with a vowel. There are some who think that makes the language sound \"musical\". Some think that final vowels helped the speakers remember chanted traditional stories and genealogies. Most linguists, however, think it is because of internal phonological processes.\nThere are two forms of each of the five vowels. One is regular, where the vowel is pronounced as a Spaniard would say it. The other is extended, in written form, where a horizontal bar called a kahako is over the vowel. The meanings (and pronunciations) of words spelled the same but with or without the appropriate kahakos or okinas can be very different, sometimes even embarrassing.\nLearning.\nOne might think that learning the language would be relatively easy, but that only applies to na keiki (children) who have never learned the 26 letters that English speakers use. There is a children's rhyme that goes on for a couple of minutes (and written, probably a couple dozen lines) that consists of nothing but both versions of the letters a, i and the okina. It talks of him (ia) eating (ai) his (iaia) fish (ia). \nWhen the missionaries made a written form of Hawaiian Language, they did not write the kahakos or okinas; leaving it to the context to make the meanings evident. \nSince the intent was to translate the Bible (\"Paipala\"), natives forgave some of the confusion created. They still learned how unintended \"double entendres\" could be funny in written form. When Hawaiian language newspapers started, native-speaking writers and editors were careful to avoid these (the type that was available to \"set\" did not include such \"specialty\" characters)."}

Outside of Japan, the term anime refers to Japanese animation, which this article is about.\nSome anime is drawn by hand, but anime can also be made with CGI computer animation. There are many types of anime; you can find anime about sports, magic, or romance. These are just some examples. Anime are shown on television, on DVD and VHS, and are used in video games. Also, some anime cartoons are just movies, but they have cartoon characters and animation instead of real people and places. Anime is often based on Japanese comics that are called manga and graphic novels. Sometimes live action (not animation) movies and television series are based on an anime.\nThe history of anime begins around 1900, when Japanese filmmakers tried out ways of animation at the same time as the United States, Russia, Germany and France. \nThe filmmakers in Japan did not have a lot of money to make their movies and not a lot of places where they could film their movies. The people that the filmmakers could use as actors in their movies was also a problem for making Japanese movies. Japanese people look different from people in other places in the world (e.g. If the movie's theme were about Vikings, Ancient Rome or the Black Death pandemic in Medieval Europe, for example), and it was hard for filmmakers to make a movie about places other than Japan with Japanese actors. Movie makers liked animation because then they could have animator draw other places and people that could not be filmed in a normal movie, and the animators could be very creative with the cartoons they made.\nDuring the 1970s, more and more people started to like manga. At the same time, manga were used as the starting point to make anime with the same characters and stories. Animators would take the drawings done by a manga artist and the stories the manga artist wrote, and turn them into the stories and characters of a similar anime. At that time Osamu Tezuka became very popular. Now he is called a \"legend\" and the \"god of manga\". Tezuka and other pioneers of anime made a lot of types of stories and styles that are common to anime today. The giant robot genre (known as \"mecha\" outside Japan) began with manga and anime from Tezuka's ideas. Robot anime like Gundam and Macross became classics in the 1980s. Today, the robot genre is still very popular in Japan and worldwide. In the 1980s, anime became very popular in Japan, and saw an increase in production. (Manga is much more popular than anime in Japan). There are a lot of different kinds of anime that many different kinds of people like besides Mecha, and there are types of anime based on the age of the people (e.g. \"seinen\" or \"sh\u014dnen\") who might like it or the subject of the anime.\nVery popular stories in anime and manga are often translated into other languages, and the words used in the anime or manga will be put into another language where they mean the same thing. That way, people who live outside of Japan and who do not understand Japanese (the language used for dialogue in anime and manga in Japan) can also understand the stories. If a manga or anime is not translated by a company in another country, sometimes people in that country will translate the story to share with other people for free before a company translates it for the general public. This is good because it allows more people to watch animes, but some companies think it is stealing.\nForms of anime.\nIn the late 1980s, lots of people in countries other than Japan started to like anime too. In the United States, giant robot anime became popular. In Europe, anime for children became popular. Today, many different kinds of anime are popular all around the world. Anime helped spread in popularity thanks to the internet.\nAnime Expo.\nAnime Expo is a convention all about anime. It has mostly cosplay but attendees can also meet anime creators and voice actors."}

While civil wars can take place for many of reasons, there are two common reasons.\nThe first is because the different groups disagree about who should be in charge, or how the country should be run. If two political parties disagree about the result of an election, this might lead to a war if the two sides cannot or would not come to an agreement.\nThe second is because one group of people does not want to be part of the country anymore. This is known as a war of secession. Lots of people living in a certain area might decide that they want independence to make their own country. Very few national leaders would be happy to give up land that is part of that country, and a war could result.\nSometimes the people who want to break away do not necessarily want to form a whole new country, but they might want more autonomy over their affairs. This happens sometimes when different ethnic groups belong to the same nation.\nCivil wars can go on for many years and be just as destructive and damaging as international wars. Civil wars tend to become complicated very quickly. A civil war might start between two sides, but groups might break up and the new, different sides could start fighting each other. Groups who were not involved at the beginning can easily be sucked in, as they fight to defend themselves against both sides. Civil wars with many different sides all fighting each other have occurred. Sometimes foreign countries help one side, or different countries help different sides.

It lives mostly in large tropical rivers, where it is an ambush predator. One species, the Australian saltie, also travels in coastal salt water. In very dry climates, crocodiles may aestivate and sleep out the dry season. \nThe modern type of crocodile appeared first in the Eocene period. Its ancestors go much further back to the Upper Triassic. The name \"Crocodile\" is also used for any member of the order \"Crocodilia\". They are basically Archosaurs, a group which also includes the dinosaurs. There are many species of Crocodiles including the American, slender-snouted and Orinoco crocodile.\nThe crocodile can quickly snap its jaw shut with much power. However, crocodiles have little strength when opening their jaws, such that a person could hold the jaw shut with their hands.\nCrocodiles range in size from African dwarf crocodiles that measure rarely over 5 feet (1.5 m) to saltwater crocodiles which can approach 23 feet (7 m).\nDescription.\nCrocodiles live in rivers, lakes and dams in parts of America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Some of the crocodiles from Australia live in salt water. These saltwater crocodiles are normally bigger than the ones that live in fresh water. While crocodiles spend most of their time in water, they can come out and move around on the land. \nCrocodiles cannot breathe underwater: they breathe air, just like people. When they are not active, they can hold their breath for a maximum of about two hours underwater before drowning. Normally, when underwater, they are active and can hold their breath for a maximum of 20 minutes to one hour.\nBehavior.\nFeeding.\nThe crocodile looks like it is a log, and hides beneath the surface of the water. When an animal comes down to the water to drink, the crocodile lunges out of the water, grabs the animal in its jaws, and pulls it underwater, where it drowns. After the animal is dead, the crocodile will grab a piece of meat in its jaws and spin around in a \"death roll\".\nWhat do they look like.\nTheir colors range from brown to grey and have different patterns covering them.They have many shapes and they differ in color. They have sharp claws and teeth. They can also be a greenish-brownish color.Crocodile tongues are not free. They are held in place by a membrane that can not move. Crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues.\nAlligators and crocodiles.\nAlthough there is not much difference in their life-style, biologists put alligators in a separate family. Gharials are also in a separate family, and Caimans are a sub-family of alligators.\nThe difference between an alligator and a crocodile is that one can not see the fourth tooth in the lower jaw of an alligator when the alligator's mouth is closed. One can see the fourth tooth in the lower jaw of a crocodile when its mouth is closed.\nAncient crocodiles.\nAccording to scientists, some ancient crocodiles walked on two legs like dinosaurs. The scientists found preserved footprints in South Korea. They found hind foot prints but no front foot prints or marks from a tail dragging behind. \nThey were able to tell that these ancient crocodiles walked on their hind legs with their front legs and tails off the ground. They used the whole foot, the way a human or bear does, not just the toes, the way a dinosaur, bird or dog does.\nSpecies.\nSixteen extant species of crocodile have been discovered. They are:"}

He is one of the most popular of all Russian composers. He wrote melodies which were usually dramatic and emotional. He learned a lot from studying the music of Western Europe, but his music also sounds very Russian. His compositions include 11 operas, 3 ballets, orchestral music, chamber music and over 100 songs. His famous ballets (\"Swan Lake\", \"The Nutcracker \" and \"Sleeping Beauty\") have some of the best known tunes in all of romantic music. He is widely regarded as the greatest composer of ballets.\nEarly years.\nTchaikovsky\u2019s father was a Ukrainian who worked as a mining engineer. His mother\u2019s grandfather was a Frenchman who had moved to Russia. She was a nervous woman and Tchaikovsky may have gotten his nervous character from her. Tchaikovsky was only five when he started taking piano lessons. He was soon better than his teacher. The family had an orchestrion (a kind of musical box) which played some tunes from classical music by Mozart, Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini.\nIn 1848 the family moved to St. Petersburg. Tchaikovsky was unhappy and unsettled as he was often separated from his family who moved several times. In 1854 his mother died. He tried to comfort himself by playing music. He spent nine years at the School of Jurisprudence. When he left school, he had to get a job. For four years he worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Justice. Then the composer and pianist Anton Rubinstein helped him to become a music student at the newly opened conservatory in St. Petersburg. He learned to play the flute and the organ as well as the piano and learning all about composition. In 1866 he moved to Moscow where Nikolai Rubinstein, the brother of Anton, encouraged him to write music with a Russian character. He worked very hard, and was often exhausted, but he managed to finish his First Symphony, which was performed in 1868.\nTchaikovsky met some famous musicians including the French composer Berlioz who was visiting Moscow. He also became friendly with the Russian composer Mily Balakirev who was very helpful and persuaded him to rewrite one of his works several times until it was very good. he result was a piece for orchestra called \"Romeo and Juliet\" which soon became internationally known. Balakirev had four friends who were composers. This circle of friends is often called \u201cThe Five\u201d or \u201cThe Mighty Handful\u201d. They were interested in using Russian folktunes in their music. Tchaikovsky was never a member of the group, although he liked their ideas. Tchaikovsky was different to them: he had learned music at the Conservatoire where he had studied Western music. The harmonies that he used in his works were often not suitable for Russian folktunes. He wrote many songs which are romantic in character. One of them, \"None But the Lonely Heart\", is especially well known in English.\nBy now, Tchaikovsky was writing works which were to make him very famous. He wrote two more symphonies, and his First Piano Concerto, one of the most popular of all piano concertos, was given its first performance in Boston. He was also writing operas and chamber music.\nYears of fame.\nIn 1875, Tchaikovsky began making a long tour of Europe. He liked Bizet\u2019s opera \"Carmen\", but Wagner\u2019s operas from the \"Ring cycle \"bored him. In 1877 he finished \"Swan Lake\", the first of his three ballets. The audience did not like it at first because the dancers were not very good.\nTchaikovsky was a closeted homosexual. In the summer of 1877 Tchaikovsky decided to marry. His wife was called Antonina Milyukova. The marriage was a disaster. A few weeks after the marriage, he ran away and never lived with her again.\nAnother woman was to become important in his life, but in a very different way. It was to be a very unusual relationship. Her name was Nadezhda von Meck. She was the wife of a rich man. She loved Tchaikovsky\u2019s music and promised him that she would pay him a lot of money every month so long as he promised her that he would never try to meet her. Tchaikovsky no longer needed to work. He was able to give up his teaching job at the Conservatory. For several years he spent the winters in Europe and the summers in Russia. Nadezhda and Tchaikovsky wrote long letters to one another, often quite passionate and dreamy they talked about love, life and how they wanted it to change, but they never saw one another. He had plenty of time to write music: he wrote several operas including \"Eugene Onegin\" and his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, the Violin Concerto, the Serenade for Strings, \"Capriccio Italienne\" and the \"1812 Overture\". Tchaikovsky loved Nadezhda very much but never actually told her his true feelings.\nHis last years.\nBy 1885, Tchaikovsky had tired of travelling around. He rented a country house in Klin, just outside Moscow. He lived a regular life, reading, walking in the forest, composing during the day and playing music with his friends in the evenings. He started to have more confidence as a conductor and toured Europe twice, conducting in Leipzig, Berlin, Prague, Hamburg, Paris and London. In 1889 he finished his second ballet, \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and the next year, while staying in Florence, he wrote his famous opera \"The Queen of Spades\" based on a story by Pushkin. Later that year Nadezhda von Meck wrote to him that she had lost nearly all her money and could not continue to support him.\nIn the spring of 1891 he was invited to conduct in New York where the Carnegie Hall was being opened. He also conducted concerts in Baltimore and Philadelphia. When he returned to Russia he wrote his last ballet \"The Nutcracker\" and his Sixth Symphony, known as the \u201cPath\u00e9tique\u201d which was dedicated to his nephew with whom he was passionately in love. This work is often considered his best. It was performed in St Petersburg on October 16 1893. Five days later he suddenly became ill with cholera, a disease many people were catching in the city. Tchaikovsky died four days later. Many people think that he committed suicide by deliberately drinking contaminated water. He may have wanted to (or even been forced to) commit suicide in order to avoid a scandal because he was having a relationship with a nephew of an important aristocratic man. Exactly what happened is still a mystery."}

The station is meant to be listened to mainly by people aged 15\u201329.\nBefore the launch of Radio 1, the BBC ran three radio stations (the BBC Light Programme, the BBC Home Service and the BBC Third Programme), but these were considered old fashioned and were closed down in 1967. They were replaced with Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4.\nThe launch of Radio 1 in 1967 was because of the popularity of pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline.

The word 'average' must be used because the height of the sea changes with the tides. The height of mountains, countries, and so on, is almost always given as \"above sea level\".\nTechnical details.\nSea level is generally used to refer to mean sea level (MSL). This is the average level for the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans. \nMSL is a type of standardised geodetic reference point. It is used, for example, as a geodetic datum in cartography and marine navigation. In aviation it is the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured. This is used to calibrate altitude, which influences aircraft flight levels. A common mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular place.\nSea levels can be affected by many factors. They have varied greatly over geological time scales. The careful measurement of variations in MSL offers insights into ongoing climate change. The present slight rise in sea levels is offered as proof of ongoing global warming.\nLong-term changes in sea level.\nIn Earth's long history, the continents and sea floor have changed due to plate tectonics. This affects global sea level because it alters the depths of various ocean basins, and also changes the distribution of glaciers. \nOver most of geologic time, the long-term mean sea level has been higher than today (see graph). Only at the Permian-Triassic boundary ~250 million years ago was the long-term mean sea level lower than today. This included the PermianTriassic extinction event, though this may not be relevant to the concept of sea level.\nLong term changes in the mean sea level are the result of changes in the oceanic crust, with a downward trend expected to continue in the very long term.\nRapid changes in sea level.\nRapid changes may happen by huge lakes breaking through into seas. This has happened on a number of occasions. When the latest ice age was ending, melting caused huge lakes in central North America. This eventually broke through into the Atlantic. Melting ice in the North Sea are also broke through into the English Channel. The largest known example of marine flooding was when the Atlantic breached the Strait of Gibraltar about 5.2 million years ago. This restored Mediterranean sea levels, which had dried up.\nThe present rise in sea level is taken from tide gauges. It is about 1.8\u00a0mm/yr. Active research continues in this field."}

The band was formed in Essex, England in 1977. The band split up in 1984.\nHistory.\nOriginal members.\nThe group was first of all made up of Penny Rimbaud (playing drums) and Steve Ignorant (who sang). Later they were joined by other people who also lived together in their shared house (or commune) called Dial House.\nFirst concerts.\nCrass did their first concert at a squatted festival in Huntley Street, North London. Soon after they played at the famous punk club The Roxy in London's Covent Garden area. However the group were made to come off of the stage because they were very drunk. They also did early concerts with punk band the UK Subs, but not many people went to watch these concerts.\nFirst fashion statements.\nAfter this members of Crass decided to be more serious about what they were doing. They decided to wear black clothes all of the time, whether or not they were on stage. This was so that no member of the band would be seen as the group 'leader'. They also made a banner that they hung up behind them when they were playing live. This had a logo on it that was made up of symbols like the Christian cross, the swastika and the British flag, as well as a snake with two heads that is eating itself. The meaning of this logo was the idea that \"power will destroy itself\".\nAlbums.\nFirst album.\nCrass released their first record in 1978. It was called \"The Feeding of the 5000\". It was meant to have 18 songs on it, but one song was banned by the people who worked at the factory where the records were made. This was because they thought it was blasphemous. This song was called \"Asylum\". The band instead released the record with a 2-minute gap where that song had been, which they called \"The Sound of Free Speech\". After this they set up their own record label, Crass Records. This was so that they could control what was on their own records in the future. They re-recorded and released the song that had been banned as a single. They also re-released the first LP with the banned song put back on it.\nSecond album.\nThe second LP released by Crass was the double album \"Stations of the Crass\". It was released in 1979. One side of this LP was a recording of a live concert that the band played at the Pied Bull pub in Islington, London on August 7, 1979.\nThird album.\nTheir next LP was released in 1981. It was called \"Penis Envy\". The band had deliberately changed their sound for this record. The lyrics and the record cover artwork had a strong feminist message. Steve Ignorant did not appear upon it. Instead only the women members of the band, Eve Libertine and Joy DeVivre sung the songs.\nOther albums recorded.\nThe Crass Records label also released many other records by other musicians and bands. These included Flux Of Pink Indians, Conflict, Poison Girls, Zounds, Honey Bane, Rudimentary Peni and others."}

{"id": "15128", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15128", "title": "USB", "text": "The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is technology that allows a person to connect an electronic device to a computer. It is a fast serial bus. \nIt is mostly used on personal computers. USB is also used on other devices, such as smartphones and video game consoles. USB connects different devices using a standard interface.\nMost people use USB for computer mice, keyboards, scanners, printers, digital cameras, and USB flash drives. There are over six billion USB devices around the world.\nThe standard was made to improve plug and play devices. This means that a device can be plugged into a free socket, and simply work. The computer will notice the device. The computer sometimes installs special software to use the device. The device can be removed after it stops being used. This technology is called \"hot swapping\". \"Hot swapping\" means it can be plugged and unplugged while the power is on. The computer does not need to be turned off for people to change the devices.\nUSB can provide a small amount of power to the attached device through the USB cord. Devices that only need a little power can get it from the bus, and do not need a separate electric power plug. That allows gadgets like USB battery chargers, lights, and fans.\nAs of 2015, USB has mostly replaced several older standards. Those include the parallel port, serial port and SCSI. These old standards are still used for a few jobs where USB cannot replace them.\nBrief history.\nThe first version of the Universal Serial Bus was created in 1995. This new technology became an instant success. Since the introduction of USB, people that make electronic devices thought about how it could be used in the future. Today, USB connects a computer or other devices like laptops and MP3 players to peripheral devices.\nThe bus was introduced by seven companies which represent the leaders in the industry of information technology: Compaq, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, Northern Telecom, and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).\nSeveral years earlier, adopters and developers of USB held a meeting called \"Plugfest\" at a special hotel in California to test their devices. They selected a hotel that included rooms for sleeping and for testing. The meeting lasted three days. During the meeting, the representatives of about 50 companies connected their USB devices to one general host system.\nThe logo of the USB device also has its own history. The USB logo was in development for several months. \nDifferent standards.\nCurrently, five different USB standards are used: USB 1.0, USB 1.1, USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and USB 3.1. USB 3.1 was released in 2016 and doubled the speed of 3.0. It optionally uses a different connector called USB Type-C, which is reversible (meaning you can plug it in both ways). USB 1.0 is now rarely used.\nUSB offers five different transfer speeds: 1.5 MBit per second (called \"low speed\"), 12 MBit per second (\"Full Speed\"), 480 MBit/second (\"Hi Speed\"), 5Gbit per second (called \"super speed\"), and 10 Gbit/s (\u201csuper speed+\u201c). Hi speed is only available in USB 2.0 and later, and Super speed is only available in USB 3.0. These speeds are raw bit rates (in Million bits per second). The actual data rate is usually lower due to protocol overhead.\nIn order to use the \"hi speed\" transfer rate, the USB controller and the connected device both need to support it. USB is backwards compatible. Faster and slower USB devices and controllers can be connected together, but they will run at the slower speed.\nUSB Hubs.\nAlmost all computers sold today have USB ports, and most of them support USB 2.0 or later. The number of ports they have is usually limited, though. Between two and six ports are common. USB allows connecting USB hubs to add more USB ports.\nThe hubs themselves are also compliant to one of the USB standards. Devices connected to a USB 1.1 hub will only go as fast as USB 1.1 rates. Devices connected to a later controller can use different standards.\nUSB Connectors.\nUSB was designed to be easy to use. The engineers learned from other connectors before they designed USB connectors. There are 3 connectors. \nHow USB works.\nA USB system has an asymmetric design. It is made of a host, several downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a star topology. Additional USB hubs may be included in the tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels.\nA USB host can have multiple host controllers. Each host controller provides one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including the hub devices, may be connected to a single host controller.\nUSB devices are linked in series through \"hubs\". There is always one hub known as the root hub. The root hub is built into the host controller. There are special hubs, called \"sharing hubs\". These allow multiple computers to access the same peripheral devices. They work by switching the access between PCs, either manually or automatically. They are popular in small-office environments. In network terms, they converge rather than diverge branches.\nA physical USB device can have several logical sub-devices that are referred to as \"device functions\". A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function).\nUSB device communication is based on \"pipes\" (logical channels). Pipes are connections from the host controller to a logical entity on the device named an endpoint. The term \"endpoint\" is occasionally used to incorrectly refer to the pipe. A USB device can have up to 32 active pipes, 16 into the host controller and 16 out of the controller.\nEach endpoint can transfer data in one direction only, either into or out of the device, so each pipe is uni-directional. Endpoints are grouped into \"interfaces\" and each interface is associated with a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and which is not associated with any interface.\nWhen a USB device is first connected to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The speed of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host, then the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device is supported by the host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.\nThe host controller polls the bus for traffic, usually in a round-robin fashion, so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller.\nHost controllers.\nThe computer hardware that contains the host controller and the root hub has an interface for the programmer. It is called \"Host Controller Device\" (HCD) and is defined by the hardware implementer.\nFor USB 1.0 and 1.1, there were two different HCD implementations, \"Open Host Controller Interface\" (OHCI) and \"Universal Host Controller Interface\" (UHCI). OHCI was developed by Compaq, Microsoft and National Semiconductor, UHCI by Intel.\nVIA Technologies licensed the UHCI standard from Intel; all other chipset implementers use OHCI. UHCI relies more on software. This means UHCI is slightly more processor-intensive than OHCI but easier and cheaper to make. Because there were two different implementations, operating system vendors and hardware vendors needed to develop and test on both of them. This increased cost.\nThe USB specification does not specify any HCD interfaces and is not concerned with them. In other words, USB defines the format of data transfer through the port, but not the system by which the USB hardware communicates with the computer it sits in.\nDuring the design phase of USB 2.0, the USB-IF insisted that there was only one implementation. The USB 2.0 HCD implementation is called the \"Enhanced Host Controller Interface\" (EHCI). Only EHCI can support hi-speed (480\u00a0Mbit/s) transfers. Most of PCI-based EHCI controllers have other HCD implementations called 'companion host controller' to support Full Speed (12\u00a0Mbit/s) and may be used for any device that claims to be a member of a certain class. An operating system is supposed to implement all device classes, so it can provide generic drivers for any USB device. Device classes are decided upon by the Device Working Group of the USB Implementers Forum.\nUSB device classes.\nDevice classes include:\n Use class information in the Interface Descriptors. This base class is defined to be used in Device Descriptors to indicate that class information should be determined from the Interface Descriptors in the device."}

It is often described as harder, louder, and cruder than other rock music. Many punk rock songs have lyrics (words) which tell angry stories or which use rude words.\nAbout punk rock.\nPunk rock is a style of rock music. Many musicians and punk rock music listeners (\"punk rockers\") want to protest or rebel against the norms or rules of society. Punks say that people should \"Do It Yourself\", which means that people should try to accomplish their goals using the materials in their own communities. Many punk bands make their own music recordings and distribute them without using a major record company.\nMany punks have strong political beliefs. Punk rock musicians are often mad at the government, the police, and laws. Many punk rock songs protest injustice, lies, and unfairness in countries. Almost all punks are leftists, who believe that a country should share the products and food that it produces with all the people in the country. Some punks are vegetarian or vegans, because they believe that animals should not be killed for food. Some punks are anarchists. Very few punks are conservative, libertarian, or Republican.\nMany punk musicians put colored hair dye in their hair or put gel to make it stand up. They wear distinctive clothes as a form of protest or rebellion against the norms and rules of society.\nHistory.\n1970s.\nPunk rock developed in New York City in the mid-1970s. Bands like The Ramones, Television, The Heartbreakers, Blondie, joy division and Patti Smith played loud, angry songs. Many bands played at a club called CBGB's. The music soon spread to Australia and Britain, were bands started playing punk rock in 1976-1977. British bands like Buzzcocks, The Clash, The Damned, Generation X, The Jam, and Sex Pistols played punk rock music that was inspired by the music being played in New York, as well as by garage rock, pub rock, and other protopunk music.\nThese early \"punks\" rejected the excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They created fast, hard-edged music, with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. They often did controversial things, such as saying bad words in public. Many newspapers wrote articles about the \"bad\" behavior of punk rock musicians.\n1980s.\nIn the 1980s, a new type of punk rock called \"hardcore punk\" or \"hardcore\" developed. It was louder, harder, and faster than the original punk rock. By the mid-1980s, hardcore punk rock began being mixed with Heavy Metal rock music. Many hardcore bands began playing in the United States and in the UK.\n1990s.\nIn the 1990s, punk rock began being mixed with pop music to create a new lighter style of music called pop-punk. Pop-punk bands include Green Day and Good Charlotte. Some pop-punk bands mixed punk rock stars \nska music.\n2000s.\nPop-punk was still popular in the 2000s. Some people who like the 1970s-style punk rock criticize pop-punk because pop-punk is commercialized.\nSome people say that punk rock is dead. But that is not true, because the spirit lives on and many punk rockers are around today."}

It claimed responsibility for the September 11 attacks on the United States. It is also responsible of many other mass-casualty attacks against civilian and military targets. He was a Saudi Arabian, a member of the wealthy bin Laden family, and an ethnic Yemeni Kindite.\nEarly life.\nHe was born in the bin Laden family to billionaire Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden in Saudi Arabia. He studied there in college until 1979, when he joined the mujahideen forces in Pakistan against the Soviets in Afghanistan. He helped to fund the mujahideen by funneling arms, money and fighters from the Arab world into Afghanistan, also gaining popularity from many Arabs. In 1988, he formed al-Qaeda. \nHe was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, and shifted his base to Sudan, until US pressure forced him to leave Sudan in 1996. After establishing a new base in Afghanistan, he declared a war against the United States, initiating a series of bombings and related attacks. Bin Laden was on the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists for his involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings.\nFrom 2001 to 2011, bin Laden was a major target of the War on Terror, as the FBI placed a $25 million reward on him in their search for him. On May 2, 2011, bin Laden was shot and killed inside a private residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, by members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group and Central Intelligence Agency operatives in a covert operation ordered by U.S. President Barack Obama.\nBeliefs and ideology.\nBin Laden probably believed that the restoration of Sharia law would set things right in the Muslim world, and that all other ideologies\u2014\"pan-Arabism, socialism, communism, democracy\"\u2014must be opposed. These beliefs, along with violent expansive jihad, have sometimes been called Qutbism.\nHe believed Afghanistan under the rule of Mullah Omar's Taliban was \"the only Islamic country\" in the Muslim world. Bin Laden had consistently talked about his belief in the need for violent jihad to make right what he believed are injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the United States and sometimes by other non-Muslim states, the need to eliminate the state of Israel, and the necessity of forcing the US to withdraw from the Middle East. He had also called on Americans to \"reject the immoral acts of fornication and homosexuality, intoxicants (e.g. alcohol), gambling, and usury\" in an October 2002 letter.\nOne of Bin Laden's most infamous beliefs was that civilians, including women and children, are legitimate targets of jihad. Bin Laden was antisemitic, and had delivered warnings against alleged Jewish conspiracies: \"These Jews are masters of usury and leaders in treachery. They will leave you nothing, either in this world or the next\". Shia Muslims have been listed along with \"Heretics... America and Israel,\" as the four principal \"enemies of Islam\" at the ideology classes of bin Laden's Al-Qaeda organization.p303\nIn keeping with Wahhabi beliefs (the Saudi type of Islam), bin Laden opposed music on religious grounds,p167 and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in \"earth-moving machinery and genetic engineering of plants\" on the one hand, but rejected \"chilled water\" on the other.p172\nHis viewpoints and methods of achieving them led to him been designated as a terrorist by scholars, journalists from the New York Times, the British Broadcasting Corporation, Qatari news station Al Jazeera, analysts such as Peter Bergen, Michael Scheuer, Marc Sageman, and Bruce Hoffman and he was indicted on terrorism charges by law enforcement agencies in Madrid, New York City, and Tripoli. He stayed in hiding until he was killed by the United States in Pakistan, in May 2011.\nNames.\nOsama bin Laden's name can be transliterated in many ways. Us\u0101mah bin Muhammad bin 'Awad bin L\u0101din (Arabic: \u0623\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0648\u0636 \u0628\u0646\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0646), shortened to Usama bin Laden (\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0644\u0627\u062f\u0646).\nThe form used here, Osama bin Laden, is used by most English-language mass media. This includes CNN and the BBC. The FBI and Fox News use Usama bin Laden. Often the name is abbreviated to UBL.\nThe bin Laden family (or \"Binladin,\" as they like to be called) usually use the name as a surname in the Western style. The family company is known as the \"Binladin Brothers for Contracting and Industry\". It is one of the largest corporations in Saudi Arabia.\nBin Laden had many aliases and nicknames, such as \"the Prince\", \"the Emir\", \"Abu Abdallah\", \"Mujahid Shayekh\", and \"the Director\".\nMarriages.\nBin Laden was first married at the age of 17 to a Syrian cousin. Her name was Najwa Ghanem. She was probably two years younger than he. They had 11 children. Najwa left bin Laden just before 9/11.\nHe was married to Khadijah (1983\u20131995, divorced). His next wife was Khairiah (1985\u20132011, his death). His fourth wife was Siham (1987\u20132011, his death). He was married to unknown woman in 1996 but the marriage was annulled within a few days. His last wife was Amal (2000\u20132011, his death). There were a total of nine children from these later marriages, making 20 in all.\nDeath.\nU.S. President Barack Obama launched a mission, \"Operation Neptune Spear\", where United States Special Operation forces raided bin Laden's hideout compound. On the night of 2 May 2011 (Pakistani time; 1 May 2011 U.S. time), bin Laden was killed by bullets to the chest and head. His body was buried at sea later that day so there would be no grave."}

This allowed Britain to become the world's largest sea power for 100 years. The Battle of Trafalgar was the most important sea battle of the 19th century.\nBefore the battle.\nThe Napoleonic Wars had gone on for some time. France had built the strongest army in Europe, and controlled much of the land. Because it was an island, Britain had built a strong Royal Navy and used this to blockade France to prevent French ships from leaving their ports. The French leader Napoleon Bonaparte wanted to invade and conquer Britain, which meant he had to sink the British navy first, otherwise it would be able to prevent his army from landing.\nThe British knew that France might try to attack them, and had placed ships outside the important French ports, like Toulon. The admiral in charge of the British fleet was Lord Horatio Nelson. He had become famous in Britain for his victories over the French, such as at the Battle of the Nile in 1798.\nBut the French navy managed to avoid Nelson's fleet and leave Toulon during a storm and met a group of Spanish ships. Spain at the time was an ally (partner) of France. This small fleet first sailed to the West Indies, then returned across the Atlantic Ocean to the Spanish port of Cadiz. They wanted to join with more French ships to make a stronger fleet. The British had chased them both ways across the ocean.\nThe battle.\nThe French then learned that some British ships had been seen in Gibraltar, and thought this meant that the British fleet was not as strong as it had been before. So they decided that this was the best time to leave Cadiz.\nThe next day, the 33 ships of the French and Spanish fleet were met by the 27 ships of the British. Nelson had put his ships into two lines. Before the battle started, he sent a message which was to become famous: \"England expects that every man will do his duty\".\nThe two British lines sailed through the French and Spanish line, splitting it, and was able to cause great damage to its ships using their cannons\nHowever, Admiral Nelson, on board his ship, \"HMS Victory\", was hit by a musket bullet fired by a sniper from the French ship \"Redoutable\". The bullet entered via his shoulder, went into his lung and lodged in his spine. He was taken below the deck and died later, shortly before 4:30pm, as the battle died down. The French and Spanish had lost 22 ships, the British lost none.\nAfter the battle.\nBecause France was unable to invade Britain, British soldiers were able to fight on the European continent together with the armies of other countries against the armies of Napoleon. In the end, Napoleon was finally defeated, in 1815, at the Battle of Waterloo. With control of the seas, Britain was able to build up a large empire during the years that followed and its navy was the world's largest for over a hundred years.\nNelson's body was brought back to Great Britain and he was given a hero's funeral. In 1843, the famous Trafalgar Square and Nelson's Column were built in London to honor him."}

The book is about what Orwell thought the world could have looked like in the year 1984. It describes a terrifying world where governments control and watch everyone's lives. The main character is Winston Smith. He lives in a country that is ruled by a powerful \"Party\" and its leader Big Brother, and dreams of changing this. He falls in love with Julia, who agrees with him, and is led into rebellion against the government.\nThe book is very famous. Many of its ideas are also famous. Among these are \"Big Brother\", \"Newspeak\", \"Room 101\" and \"unperson\". In 2005, \"Time\" (a magazine) called it one the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.\nPlot.\nIn the year 1984, the world is divided into three massive countries that are in endless war with each other: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. Each country has a totalitarian government, meaning that the government tries to control everything that its people do. Great Britain is now named \"Airstrip One\" and is part of Oceania. Oceania is ruled by \"the Party\". They use the \"Thought Police\" and \"telescreens\" (two-way televisions) to spy on people. People also have to show love for the Party and its leader, Big Brother. While pictures of Big Brother are everywhere, he is never seen for real, and he may not even exist.\nWinston Smith is an ordinary member of the Party. He works for the \"Ministry of Truth\". His job is to re-write history when the Party wants him to. The Party kills anyone whom it thinks threatens its grip on power, sometimes for reasons that make no sense. When these people are killed, the Party also hides any sign that they existed. Winston works hard and pretends to love the Party. His secret is that he hates the Party and dreams of fighting them. Winston buys a diary from a shopkeeper called Mr Charrington.\nHe hides the diary in his room, where he writes about his secrets. He falls in love with a woman called Julia. The Party will not allow this, so they go out into the countryside to meet in secret. Later, they start meeting in a room at Mr Charrington's shop. O'Brien, an important member of the Party, tells Winston that he also hates the Party. Winston and Julia meet O'Brien at his home, where he gives them a book. The book is about how the Party stays in power. It says that the Party can be stopped if ordinary people rise up against it.\nWinston and Julia are betrayed. Winston is taken to the \"Ministry of Love\". This is the prison of Oceania. O'Brien tells Winston that he was only pretending to be his friend. Winston is hurt badly and told he must stop hating the Party and do everything they want him to do, even if he has to say that \"2 + 2 = 5\". O'Brien says that once this is finished, Winston will leave the Ministry of Love and will return to a normal life for some months or years. After this, they will shoot him. But first, they want to make him turn against Julia.\nIn the end, Winston is taken to \"Room 101\", where he must face his worst fear: rats. As a cage of hungry rats is pushed against his face, Winston tells them to \"Do it to Julia!\" After Winston leaves the Ministry of Love, he meets Julia. He says he turned against her in Room 101, and she says she did the same. Winston then sits alone in a caf\u00e9. The last words of the story are: \"He loved Big Brother.\"\nBackground.\nOrwell got the idea for the book when he saw in the newspapers of London that they listed how much the country's supplies increased (more supplies) during World War II when they were actually very low on supplies and were getting smaller. He started writing a political satire of the possible condition of Britain in 50 years. He wrote it in 1948, mostly during a visit to Jura, Scotland. He sent the writing to his publishers in December 1948.\nSetting.\nThe main character, Winston Smith, lives in the town of London, United Kingdom (although in the novel, the United Kingdom is called \"Airstrip One\"). Airstrip One is only a small part of the mega state (big country) of Oceania. Oceania is a very large country. The Americas, Greenland, Iceland, South Africa, Madagascar, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea, all come together to create the country of Oceania. There are two other countries in the novel - Eurasia, and Eastasia. Europe (not including the United Kingdom), Russia, and half of Mongolia, make up the country of Eurasia. China, Japan, Korea, and some north-west countries in Asia, make up the country of Eastasia. The equatorial countries (the Middle East, North Africa, etc.) are not part of any of these three countries, as Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia are always fighting over these places.\nPeople in Oceania belong to three groups:\nParty workers belong to four \"ministries\":\nThe leader of Ocenia is Big Brother. His picture is seen everywhere, along with the words \"Big Brother is watching you.\" However, it is not clear if he is a real person. Emmanuel Goldstein and O'Brien both say that the main role of Big Brother is to be a symbol for the Party. O'Brien also says that Big Brother will never die.\nIdeas.\nThe book was an attack on totalitarianism (when a government tries to control people's lives) and dictatorship (rule by one person). George Orwell was a democratic socialist who was against any form of dictatorship. He once wrote: Later he repeated that idea, writing about \"1984\" \nNewspeak.\nNewspeak is a fictional language (artlang) that appears in the book \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". It is the official language of Oceania. At the end of his book, George Orwell described Newspeak. It started out as the English language, but the number of words gets smaller each year. The Party are trying to stop people from rebelling, so it destroys words like \"freedom\" and \"love\", saying that people can not think of it if there is no word for it. In the society, this is supposed to prevent thoughtcrime, which is thinking against the Party, or thinking about the past. For example, a person could not say \"I want to be free\", because there was no word for \"free\" any more, so the person could not describe what he or she was feeling. At the time, it was supposed to make fun of what was later called \"politically correct\" speech, and \"thoughtcrime\" made fun of censorship. \"Newspeak\" is also used for military reasons, such as Oceania's Ministry of Peace (in Newspeak: \"Minipax\"), really the war department. Words like \"Peace\", \"Truth\", \"Love\", and \"Plenty\" were used in Newspeak a lot to mean their exact opposites. Another \"Newspeak\" word, \"joycamp\", means \"forced labor camp\". Other \"Newspeak\" words were used for political reasons. Words like \"crimethink\" were defined by the \"Party\", and became laws of the land.\nReception.\n\"Book\" magazine ranked the character of Big Brother as #59 on its \"100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900\" list."}

He was the only president to serve a second term that did not begin as soon as the first had ended. Cleveland was the first Democrat elected as President after the Civil War.\nHe was known for his honesty, integrity, and having a firm stance against corruption. He believed in small government (he wanted the government to tax less and spend less). He used the presidential veto power over 500 times, far more than most other presidents, to reject bills he disagreed with. He did not want the United States to get its military involved in Latin America.\nCleveland was born on March 18, 1837 in Caldwell, New Jersey. He was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland studied at New York Institute for the Blind. He was married to Frances Folsom, who was over 20 years younger. In fact, many people expected Cleveland to marry her mother Emma. He was the first president to marry in the White House. They had one child, Ruth Cleveland, during his presidency. \nDuring his second term, he had an emergency surgery for jaw cancer on a boat in the middle of a river to avoid publicity.

{"id": "15210", "revid": "7886933", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15210", "title": "Fascism", "text": "Fascism is a form of government in which most of the country's power is held by one ruler. Fascist governments are usually totalitarian and authoritarian one-party states. Under fascism, the economy and other parts of society are heavily and closely controlled by the government, usually by using a form of authoritarian corporatism. The government uses violence to arrest, kill or otherwise stop anyone it does not like.\nThree large fascist countries were Italy under Benito Mussolini, Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, and Spain under Francisco Franco.\nMussolini invented fascism in Italy in the late 1910s and developed it fully in the 1930s. When Hitler came to power in Germany in the 1930s, he copied Mussolini. Mussolini wrote a political paper, which is called The Doctrine of Fascism in English. He started writing it in 1927, but it was only published in 1932. Most of it was probably written by Giovanni Gentile, an Italian philosopher.\nMain ideas.\nNot all scholars agree on what fascism is. Philosopher Jason Stanley of Yale University says it is \"a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation.\" That is, fascism focuses on one person as leader, fascism says communism is bad, and fascism says that at least one group of people is bad and has caused the nation's problems. This group could be people from other countries or groups of people within the country. Under Hitler's fascist Germany, the government blamed Jews, communists, homosexuals, the disabled, Roma and other people for Germany's problems, arrested those people, and took them to camps to be killed.\nIn 2003, Lawrence Britt wrote \"14 Defining Characteristics of Fascism\":\nName.\nThe name fascism comes from the Italian word \"fascio\" for \"bundle\". This word comes from the Latin word \"fasces\" which was an axe surrounded by a bundle of sticks. In Ancient Rome, leaders carried the fasces as a symbol of their power.\nOrigins.\nA journalist named Benito Mussolini invented fascism. He started Italy's fascist party in 1919. He became Italy's prime minister in 1922. He was not elected. His supporters walked into Rome in large numbers, and the king of Italy made him prime minister. Although, officially, the fascist party in Italy was ruled by a \"grand council\" from 1922 until the end of World War II, Benito Mussolini really had almost all the power in the country.\nAccording to scholar Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Mussolini believed democracy had failed. He had been a Socialist but left the movement because he thought it was not good either. He believed democracy failed because of social class. Under fascism, Mussolini would say, people would focus on the nation and people would not think about social class.\nHowever, Mussolini also believed that to make fascism work, he and his followers had to remove anything that could distract people from the nation. He also believed he should get to decide who in Italy counted as part of the Italian nation and he should get to throw out or arrest anyone he said did not count as a real Italian. He believed it was right to use violence to remove those distractions and those people. Groups of people with weapons would go out into the streets and beat up or even kill people Mussolini did not like.\nMussolini did not allow journalists to write what they wanted.\nMussolini believed that Italy should be made of white people, so he encouraged white women to have more babies and persecuted people who were not white.\nFascism vs other types of totalitarianism.\nOne of the reasons fascism spread in the early 20th century was because the Russian Revolution had just happened and people were afraid of communism. Sometimes landowners and business owners would support fascists because they were afraid of what would happen if the country became communist instead.\nIn her work, \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\", published in 1951, Hannah Arendt compared National Socialism, Stalinism and Maoism. She does not talk about these regimes being fascist; according to her, they are totalitarian. In 1967, German philosoper J\u00fcrgen Habermas warned about a \"left-wing fascism\" of a protest movement in Germany of the 1960s, commonly known as Ausserparlametarische Opposition, or APO.\nOpposition.\nThere is more than one reason why people living in democratic states oppose fascism, but the main reason is that in a Fascist government the individual citizen doesn't always have the option to vote, nor do they have the option to live a lifestyle which may be seen as immoral, useless, and unproductive towards society. If you are not heterosexual (homosexual, cross-dressing, changing genders, etc.) you can be arrested and put on trial.\n20th century.\nThe fascist governments in Italy and Germany were removed after they lost World War II, but fascism continued as military dictatorships under Salazar in Portugal, Franco in Spain, in some parts of Latin America, Africa, and Asia.\n21st century.\nIn the 21st century, fascist political movements exist in many countries."}
{"id": "15211", "revid": "73230", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15211", "title": "Erection", "text": "An erection () of a body part such as a man's penis, a woman's clitoris or a nipple refers to it becoming larger and harder.\nThe term \"erection\" is most often used to refer to an erection of the penis. It is widely believed that a man's penis needs to be erect in order for him to take part in sexual intercourse and penetrate his partner's vagina and to ejaculate semen, but all are possible without an erection. In a healthy male, an erection will usually occur if the man is sexually aroused (made sexually excited) or stimulated. This can happen if he is touched sexually, or even if he is not touched \u2013 for example, if he sees a naked person or thinks about having sex with someone else. Erections can also occur without thinking about sex or being touched. Most boy teenagers have unexpected erections. This is normal. Erections happen several times during the night. This happens to all healthy adult males of all ages. This also happens when a man wakes up. That is normal too. Tissues in the penis called the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis fill with blood, causing the penis to become longer, thicker, harder and to stand upright. A man's erection usually stops if he is no longer sexually aroused, or after he has had an orgasm and has ejaculated. An erection will usually not be possible immediately following ejaculation, although adolescent males may be able to achieve erections immediately following ejaculation. The time period during which an erection cannot be repeated following ejaculation is called the refractory period.\nOverview.\nErect penises have appeared in erotic (sexually exciting) art for a very long time. Pictures of men with erections appear on ancient objects and in paintings. In the past, the erect penis was also a symbol or sign of health and fertility (the ability to give life). Ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans believed in gods that had erect penises. Today, erect penises do not often appear in artworks or movies because many people think that showing a man's penis when it is erect is obscene (not decent). Men with larger penises are often thought to be more handsome, manly and powerful. A lot of people also believe that men with bigger penises are better at making their partners feel good when they are having sex. However, this is not always true.\nLike a man's penis, a woman's clitoris can also become erect. This happens in a similar way to an erection of the penis. The clitoris also has a corpora cavernosa, and when a woman is sexually excited this part of the clitoris fill with blood. This causes the clitoris and other parts of the woman's sex organs to become larger, harder, redder in colour, and very sensitive to being touched.\nThe nipples of men and women can also become erect. Women's nipples become erect when they are breastfeeding (giving milk to their babies from their breasts). Men and women may also have an erection of their nipples when they are sexually excited, or if they feel cold. Nipples do not have any tissue in them that fills with blood. Instead, the body's nervous system makes muscles in the nipples contract (become shorter), causing them to stand up and become slightly harder.\nBlood flows out of the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa penis, and the penis goes back to its normal size. A man who often has problems having or keeping an erection of his penis is said to have erectile dysfunction (ED). On the other hand, an erection that lasts too long is also a dangerous condition called priapism. Men who want to get less erections sometimes take anaphrodisiacs.\nPenis.\nThe term \"erection\" is most often used to refer to an erection of the penis. A man's penis is usually soft, quite short and hangs down. When the penis is like this, it is said to be flaccid (). In order for the man to take part in sexual intercourse by putting his penis inside a woman's vagina, his penis needs to become longer, thicker, harder. For many men it stands upright. It is okay if it points out or down. When the penis is hard, it is said that the penis is erect or that the man has an erection. The scrotum (the bag containing a man's testicles or \"balls\") will usually tighten during erection. The penis usually needs to be at least mildly erect before the man can have an orgasm and ejaculate semen.\nThe scientific name for an erection is \"tumescence\" (which means \"swelling\"). Some slang terms for having an erection are \"getting hard\", \"getting wood\" and \"having a hard-on\", and an erect penis is informally called a \"boner\", \"hard-on\", \"stiffy\", \"wood\" or \"woody\".\nHow it happens.\nThe penis is shaped like a banana or sausage. It has a duct or tube called the urethra running right through it. Semen and urine pass along the urethra to get out of the body. Around the whole urethra is tissue called the corpus spongiosum penis (which is Latin for \"body of the penis that is like a sponge\"). It is near the lower surface of the penis. Also inside the penis near its upper surface are two cylindrical tissues called the corpora cavernosa penis (Latin for \"bodies of the penis that are like caves\"). (One of these tissues by itself is called a corpus cavernosum.) The corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis are filled with many blood vessels called arteries which carry blood.\nWhen a man is sexually aroused or stimulated (made sexually excited) by touch \u2013 for example, if he masturbates or another person touches him in a sexual way \u2013 the touching is picked up by nerves in the arteries of the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis. The nerves then cause a chemical called nitric oxide to be released into the arteries. This makes the arteries dilate (become wider), and they fill up with blood. Thus, the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis all fill with blood and become larger and harder. This makes the penis grow longer, thicker and harder. The corpora cavernosa penis press against blood vessels called veins that let blood flow out of the penis. Since less blood can flow out of the penis through the veins, more of it stays in the penis, which remains hard. During an erection, a valve stops urine from entering the urethra so that only semen flows along it. This is why it is difficult for a man to urinate when he is having an erection.\nA man can also become sexually aroused without being touched, for example, if he sees a naked person or thinks about having sex with someone. In this case, his brain sends messages through his spinal cord (which is inside his vertebral column or backbone) to his penis and makes an erection happen. The brain can also stop an erection from happening, even if the man is being touched sexually.\nAfter a man has had an orgasm and has ejaculated, his erection usually ends. How long this takes depends on the length and thickness of his penis. A man can also stop having an erection without having an orgasm and ejaculating, if he is no longer sexually aroused. Nerves in his body cause the arteries in the penis to constrict (become narrower). This forces blood out of the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis. As they go back to their normal size, they do not press so much on the veins leading out of the penis. This lets blood flow faster out of the corpus spongiosum penis and corpora cavernosa penis. The scientific term for this process is \"detumescence\".\nShape and size.\nThe angle that an erect penis makes varies from one man to another. If it is imagined that a man is standing upright and there is a horizontal line stretching out from the base of his penis, most men's erect penises point upwards from the line at a certain angle. However, it is common and normal for an erect penis to point nearly vertically upwards, nearly vertically downwards. The angle depends on how long a man's suspensory ligament is. The suspensory ligament is a band of tough, stringy tissue that joins a man's penis to the front of his pelvis.\nThe following table shows how common various erection angles are for a standing male. In the table, zero degrees (0\u00b0) is pointing straight up against the abdomen, 90\u00b0 is horizontal and pointing straight forward, and 180\u00b0 is pointing straight down to the feet. An upward pointing angle is most common and the average erection angle is 74.3 degrees.\nFew men's penises are completely straight when they are erect. It is common for an erect penis to have a slight curve in it. The curve can be up or down, or to the left or right. A curve of up to 30\u00b0 is considered normal, and medical treatment is usually not needed unless the angle of curvature is more than 45\u00b0. A curved penis does not usually cause a man any problems when he is having sex. However, if the curvature of a penis changes, this could be caused by an illness called Peyronie's disease (see below). An erection that pokes through clothing is sometimes called a \"manbulge\".\nA survey of 300 men over the age of 18 carried out between 11 March and 17 March 2001 in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, found that among those men the average erect human penis was about 14.928 centimetres (5.877 inches) long, and that most of them had an erect penis length of between 14 and 16 centimetres (5.5 and 6.3 inches). The typical girth or circumference (the length around the outside of the penis) was about 12.63 centimetres (4.972 inches), and most erect penises had a girth of between 12 and 13 centimetres (4.7 and 5.1 inches). As this survey was only done in one city, its findings may not apply to men from other countries.\nThe size of an erect penis generally does not change after puberty, the time when a boy becomes sexually mature. Some people have surgery to make their penises larger. However, a study that came out in 2006 found that only 35% of men who had gone for such surgery were happy with the results.\nErections when sleeping.\nAn erection of the penis can also happen by itself when a man is asleep, often when he is dreaming. The scientific term for this is \"nocturnal penile tumescence\" (which means \"swelling of the penis at night\"). It is also common for a man to wake up after a night's sleep to find that he has an erection. This is often caused by his bladder being full of urine, which presses on the tissues in the penis. Such an erection is sometimes informally called a \"morning glory\" or \"morning wood\".\nUnexpected erections.\nMost boy teenagers have unexpected erections. Sometimes adult men have unexpected erections. Unexpected erections are involuntary and are normal. People call this a \"spontaneous\" (sudden or surprise) erection. Sometimes it happens in school. Sometimes it happens walking. Sometimes it happens taking clothes off for a shower or bath or swimming. This is normal. Such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public. Erections can occur unexpectedly at any time of day.\nHealth problems.\nDifficulty having an erection.\nA man who often has problems having or keeping an erection of his penis is said to have erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is also known as ED, impotence or male impotence. The study of erectile dysfunction comes within andrology, the field of science dealing with men's health.\nED is not uncommon. For example, about 10% of all men in the United Kingdom will have ED happening to them regularly at some time in their lives. It can be due to both physiological and psychological reasons. Physiological reasons are those dealing with how the body works. Psychological reasons are those involving human behaviour and how people think.\nThese are some common physiological reasons for ED:\nED can also happen for psychological reasons. For example, a man can find it difficult to have an erection:\nHaving erections is seen by many people as a very important part of being a man. Therefore, a man who has ED often feels that he is not manly enough and not successful in life. This can lead to him feeling ashamed and not as good as other men. The matter is made worse because men often do not like talking about their personal problems with other people, so they keep their unhappy feelings to themselves. However, talking to a doctor or psychiatrist (a doctor who knows a lot about mental problems) is helpful, as he or she may be able to suggest ways of dealing with the problem.\nHow ED may be treated depends on the cause. If it is caused by a disease, sometimes treating the disease will reduce the problem. For example, if a man is unable to have erections because his body does not make enough testosterone, he can be given pills to take which help his body to do so. If the blood vessels or nerves in the corpora cavernosa penis are damaged, a full cure may not be possible. However, there are some temporary treatments that allow a man to have an erection for long enough to have sex:\nErection lasting too long.\nIf a man's erection lasts for more than four hours even though he is no longer sexually excited, this is a medical problem called priapism (). The man must go to a doctor or hospital quickly if it happens. The condition is named after the Greek god Priapus, whose penis was believed to always be erect (see below). Priapism is painful, and is a medical emergency because the blood stuck in the penis can become thick and form clots. This can damage the blood vessels of the penis and lead to erectile dysfunction (ED). In serious cases the tissues of the penis can die, and the penis may have to be amputated (cut off) so that the tissue death does not spread to the rest of the body.\nIt is not really known what causes priapism. Men who suffer from priapism sometimes have blood diseases like leukemia (a type of cancer of the blood; in the United Kingdom and some other countries it is spelled \"leukaemia\") or sickle-cell disease (which makes the blood cells crescent-shaped). Problems with the nervous system such as injury to the spinal cord or abnormal growths on it can also lead to priapism. Certain medicines can make priapism happen, including some used to treat ED such as alprostadil. A 2008 study suggests that too much of the chemical adenosine in the body may cause priapism since it makes blood vessels widen which lets more blood flow into the penis.\nWhen a man with priapism is brought to the emergency department of a hospital, a doctor will usually try to remove blood from the corpora cavernosa penis by aspirating it (sucking it out) using a syringe. If this is not enough, a chemical called phenylephrine (/\"feen-il-eff-rin\"/) may be injected into the penis to try and make the blood vessels become narrower. If this also does not work, the doctor will make a shunt (a hole or passage) between the corpora cavernosa penis and corpus spongiosum penis. This allows blood to flow away from the corpora cavernosa penis into the corpus spongiosum penis. For men who have priapism again and again, it has been found that medicines such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis) may help.\nCulture.\nSymbol of sex and fertility.\nWhen an erect penis is shown in art, it is often called a phallus. Erotic (sexually exciting) art has shown phalluses for a very long time. Pictures of men with erections appear on ancient objects and in paintings.\nThe erect penis was also a symbol or sign of health and fertility (the ability to give life). The Hohle Fels phallus was found in a cave in Germany. It is a piece of stone carved to look like a penis that archaeologists believe is about 28,000 years old. (Archaeologists are scientists who study the past by looking for things that people have left behind.) From the fourth millennium B.C. (4000\u20133001 B.C.), Ancient Egyptians worshipped Min as the god of reproduction and the maker of all things. Min was shown in statues and on wall carvings as having an erect penis.\nThe Ancient Greeks believed in a god called Priapus who had a very large penis that was always erect. He was thought to protect livestock (animals kept by humans for food, milk, leather or wool), fruit plants and gardens, and men's sex organs. He was also seen as able to chase away evil, and as a protector of sailors, fishermen and others needing good luck. \nLong after the Roman Empire ended and many people became Christian, Priapus was still seen as a symbol of health and fertility. A 13th-century book called the \"Lanercost Chronicle\", which is a history of northern England and Scotland, talks about someone putting up a statue of Priapus to try and stop a disease from spreading among cattle.\nSome Native Americans in the Southwestern United States believe in a fertility god called Kokopelli who is in charge of childbirth and agriculture (the growing of plants and animals for food and other uses). He also plays tricks and is a symbol for the spirit of music. Kokopelli is sometimes shown as a man playing a flute with a humpback (a back that is bent forwards), things like feathers sticking out from his head, and a very big penis.\nModern views.\nToday, phalluses do not often appear in artworks or movies (except in pornographic movies which show people having sex with each other). This is because many people think that showing a man's penis when it is erect is obscene (not decent).\nMen with larger penises are commonly thought to be more handsome, manly and powerful. In 2006, it was reported that an Internet survey of 52,031 heterosexual (straight) men and women showed that men who thought that their penises were larger than the average size believed they were more good-looking. Of the men, 55% of them were happy with their penis size, but 45% wanted to be larger. Only 0.2% wanted a smaller penis. On the other hand, 85% of women were happy with how big their partner's penis was. Another study that also came out in 2006 in the Netherlands found that out of 251 homosexual (gay) men who were asked, most felt it was better to have a large penis, and those who thought they had one were happy about their bodies. However, just because a man has a large penis does not always mean he is sexier or stronger than other men, even though many people think this.\nA lot of people also believe that men with bigger penises are better at making their partners feel good when they are having sex. For heterosexual men, this is because it is thought that when the penis can go further into the vagina, this helps the woman have a better orgasm. Scientists are not sure whether this is true or not. Some research shows that the most sensitive area of the female sex organs includes the vulva, clitoris and the part of the vagina nearest the outside of a woman's body. There are also parts of the clitoris inside the vulva and vagina. Therefore, most men's penises are long enough to make their partners feel good during sex. Also, some studies say it is not how long but how thick a penis is that decides how well it excites a woman sexually.\nHowever, other research seems to say that a long penis that touches and sexually excites the fornix, which is the deepest part of the vagina near the cervix (the opening of the uterus into the vagina), helps a woman to have an orgasm. A study from the Netherlands of 375 women came out in 2002. This study said that although 77% of the women felt that the length of a man's penis was not important to them, quite a large number \u2013 21% \u2013 felt it was important.\nClitoris.\nThe clitoris () is part of a woman's sex organs. It makes a woman's orgasms happen, which gives her very good sexual feelings. Like a man's penis, a woman's clitoris also becomes bigger and harder, moving out and away from the body, when she is sexually excited. However, because the clitoris is much smaller than the penis, and most of the clitoris is inside the woman's body, only part of its entire length can be seen from the outside. Some clitoral erections cannot be seen as well as an erection of the penis.\nAn erection of the clitoris happens in the same way as an erection of the penis. The clitoris has a corpus cavernosum similar to the penis. However, instead of the corpus spongiosum it has two vestibular bulbs. When a woman is sexually excited, the corpus cavernosum and vestibular bulbs fill with blood. This causes the clitoris and other parts of the woman's sex organs to become larger, harder, and redder in color. When this happens, they become very sensitive to being touched.\nIf an erection of the clitoris does not go away after a long time, even though the woman is not being made sexually excited any more, this is a medical problem called clitorism. Like priapism which can affect a man's penis, it is painful. A woman who thinks she may have clitorism should see a doctor.\nClitorises range in size. From a small pea to fingertip-section(s) when still soft. They engorge with blood and become much larger in all dimensions, and firmer when aroused. They can range into even 4-5 inches in some. A penis has a tubular shape while a clitoris has a hood covering and C curvature shape, and yet still tube-like, and rides along the body. The tip can lift upward more when aroused. The tip can also be referred to as the pearl. Sometimes, it can be uncomfortable to the entire clitoris, from its sensitivity, if treated rashly, mistaking erection for pleasure. This is known mentally by the participant if pleasurable or uncomfortable. It can be hard, or mid-firm as well, and climb to a shudder, then do a sharp firm up and an outward move right before, and then a tingling jingle inside and to the g-spot on in the other - and this is an orgasm. Orgasms vary in intensity. The body and mind can be relaxed and passionate afterwards to continue with love making or setting itself.\nNipples.\nThe nipples of men and women can also become erect. Women's nipples become erect when they are breastfeeding (giving milk to their babies from their breasts). Men and women may also have an erection of their nipples when they are sexually excited. This is caused by the release of a hormone called oxytocin in the body. Nipples can also become erect when a person feels cold or sexually excited.\nUnlike the penis and clitoris, nipples do not have any tissue in them that fills with blood. Instead, the body's nervous system makes muscles in the nipples contract (become shorter), causing them to stand up and become slightly harder.\nNotes.\nAn erection is a hardening of the penis (Know more about Vidalista 20) that occurs when sponge-like tissue inside the penis fills up with blood. Usually, an erection causes the penis to enlarge and stand away from the body."}

Many people use it illegally, but it is occasionally used legally by prescription to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obesity as \"Desoxyn\".\nMethamphetamine has two isomers, \"left-handed\" and \"right-handed\". Left-handed methamphetamine helps fight stuffy nose and is legal. Right-handed methamphetamine makes people feel high and is mostly illegal. This page is mostly about the right-handed form.\nMethamphetamine is very addictive. This means that when people start taking the drug, they will want to keep taking more, even if it is making them sick.\nMethamphetamine can be in powder or crystal form, and can be snorted, smoked, injected, or eaten. In its smoked form, methamphetamine is known as \"ice,\" \"crystal,\" \"crank,\" \"batu,\" \"barang,\" \"cerita,\" or \"glass\".\nHistory.\nMethamphetamine has been around for a very long time, though the procedures for manufacturing the drug have changed throughout the years and made it much more potent. In Germany, in the late 1800s, amphetamine was developed, and in 1919, Japan created methamphetamine, which was easier to produce than amphetamine. The drug was widely used in combat during World War II to promote wakefulness. After World War II, there was an epidemic of methamphetamine abuse in Japan, according to the Foundation for a Drug-Free World.\nWays of using methamphetamine.\nSnorting.\nWhen meth is snorted, the methamphetamine crystals are ground up and made into little lines (also called rails). Then they are inhaled through the nose with rolled-up paper, rolled-up dollar bills, empty plastic pen tubes, short plastic straws, or other things that can be made into a small \"tube\" shape.\nWhen meth is snorted, its effects last longer than when it is smoked or injected. The effects can last as long as twelve hours. However, it takes longer to feel the effects, and there is not as strong of a \"rush\" (a very happy feeling called euphoria).\nSnorting methamphetamine can damage the nasal septum on the inside of the nose. Also, if people share the same snorting tube, they can get infections.\nSmoking.\nWhen meth is smoked, the crystals are placed into a glass pipe (called a \"meth pipe\") or a hollowed-out lightbulb. The crystals are warmed up from underneath by a flame (like from a lighter or matches). The methamphetamine is not actually \"smoked\" this way; it is heated up until it melts. When it melts, it turns into a gas that the user then breathes in.\nSmoking meth causes euphoria to happen very quickly, and causes strong euphoria. However, the vapor (gas) can damage the lungs.\nInjecting.\nMethamphetamine can be mixed with water, then put into a needle and injected. Meth can be injected under the skin (this is called \"skin-popping); into a muscle; or into a vein. Injecting meth into a vein causes the quickest, strongest euphoria.\nInjecting meth can damage the body in many ways. It is very addictive. People can get infections (including HIV, hepatitis C, and many others) from dirty needles.\nEating.\nIf methamphetamine is eaten, it gets absorbed into the body from the digestive system. Although the effects take longer to be felt when compared to other routes of administration (between fifteen and forty five minutes), they tend to outlast the highs achieved through smoking, injecting, and snorting. The onset is comparatively gentler, but can cause gastrointestinal problems for the user and is not considered one hundred percent safe. The body naturally filters out some toxins when methamphetamine is ingested orally, but due to the potency of the drug, addiction is still a strong risk factor.\nEffects.\nDesired effects.\nDesired effects are the things people want to feel when they take methamphetamine. These include:\nAdverse effects.\nAdverse effects are the bad things that using methamphetamine can cause. Meth has many adverse effects. For example:\nAddiction.\nMethamphetamine is very addictive. This means that when people start taking the drug, they will want to keep taking more, even if it is making them sick.\nOne of the reasons meth is so addictive is that people feel very bad when the effect begins to wear off. Many users claim to have an uncontrollable urge to get more of the drug after using it.\nWhen people are addicted to meth, they will have withdrawal symptoms when they do not take meth. This means they will feel tired and/or hungry when they do not have the drug. For example, without meth, people will feel anhedonia. This means they cannot feel good without taking meth.\nOverdose.\nOverdosing on meth (taking too much) can make a person very sick. Some of the symptoms of methamphetamine overdose are very dangerous, and can even kill a person. For example, overdosing on meth can cause:\n\"Meth Mouth\".\n\"Meth Mouth\" is a term used to describe destroyed teeth in people that use methamphetamine. Meth mouth can happen very quickly. A new addict can go from having healthy teeth to losing all of their teeth in as little as one year. The decay (rotting teeth) is not caused by methamphetamine itself, but by meth users not brushing their teeth, having a lot of sugary drinks, and having dry mouth.\nLife expectancy\nThe life expectancy of a meth addict is 5\u201310 years.\nOther effects on the body.\nMethamphetamine's effects on the body can include:\nEffects on feelings and behavior.\nMethamphetamine's effects on feelings and behavior can include:\nLong-term effects.\nTaking meth over a long time can cause Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In fact, a teenager taking methamphetamine can show symptoms similar to Alzheimer's.\nPeople who take meth over a long time often have serious psychological problems, like:\nCo-occurring disorders.\nSome of the mental health disorders that often occur with crystal meth addiction include:"}

This means it shares the British King or Queen and has the protection of the British Armed Forces. It is in southwest Europe on the Mediterranean Sea. About 32,000 people live there. They are called Gibraltarians.\nGibraltar has always been important as a military base because this is where the Mediterranean Sea narrows to only 14\u00a0kilometres (9\u00a0miles) at the Strait of Gibraltar. This meant that whichever country controlled Gibraltar could see all ships that came into the Mediterranean Sea.\nGibraltar is most famous for \"The Rock of Gibraltar\", a 426\u00a0meter high limestone rock rising out of the sea. The rock can be seen for many miles. It is home to the \"Barbary Apes\", a type of tail-less macaque which are the only wild monkeys in Europe.\nHistory.\nGibraltar was named for a general who led the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. It belonged to Spain between the years 1501 and 1704, and it was captured by a group of Dutch and British marines during the War of the Spanish Succession (1704). In 1713, Spain signed the \"Treaty of Utrecht\". This treaty ended the war and said Gibraltar would be British permanently. However, according to this treaty, if the Crown of Great Britain ever wants to leave the territory, the Crown of Spain will have a prior position in order to claim the sovereignty.\nEver since then, Spain has tried to get Gibraltar back. They attacked the Rock several times in the 18th century.\nHowever, since the 1950s, Spain has tried get Gibraltar by diplomacy (international relations) by putting different kinds of pressure and restrictions on the people of Gibraltar.\nGibraltar was very important in World War II. Since it was in such a good position, it was the perfect place for the British army and navy to have its base. In World War II the people living in Gibraltar were taken to different parts of the world like Jamaica so they could be protected from the war and also leave the Rock for the soldiers. The Rock of Gibraltar was used by these soldiers, and long tunnels were made inside it. These tunnels even had a hospital and living areas for the soldiers.\nIn 1969 Britain gave Gibraltar a new constitution. This meant that it gave the people of Gibraltar a large amount of self-government.\nIn 2002 the people of Gibraltar were asked to vote whether they wanted Spain to share Gibraltar with the United Kingdom; almost everyone voted and 98.97% said they did not.\nIn 2006 Gibraltar voted to approve a new constitution which gave full self-government to the people meaning they can independently create their own laws.\nIn 2006, Spain signed a deal to stop interfering with Gibraltar telephone lines, and daily flights to Madrid started.

It was made for 32-bit Intel x86 computers. It is part of the Microsoft Windows NT line of operating systems, and was released on February 17, 2000. Windows 2000 comes in four versions: Professional, Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server. Additionally, Microsoft offers Windows 2000 Advanced Server - Limited Edition and Datacenter Server - Limited Edition, which were released in 2001 and run on 64-bit Intel Itanium processors. Windows 2000 was designed for businesses, but it was also popular with home users.\nWindows 2000 uses two 'modes' - a 'User Mode' and a 'Kernel Mode'. The Kernel Mode is specially for hardware drivers (drivers tell the computer how to 'speak' to something) and allows drivers to 'speak' to things in the computer. The User Mode is for computer programs to run in without fear of causing harm to the computer.\nAll versions of Windows 2000 have things in common, including many system utilities such as the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) and standard system management applications such as a disk defragmentation utility. There is lots of support for different languages and for people with disabilities. Windows 2000 supports the Windows NT file system NTFS 5, the Encrypted File System (EFS), as well as basic and dynamic disk storage. Dynamic disk storage allows different types of volumes to be used (a volume is an area of storage on a hard disk that has been formatted with its own file system structure). The Windows 2000 Server version has many more features, including the ability to provide Active Directory services (a way of organising resources such as printers, users and group), a distributed file system (a file system that supports sharing of files) and fault-redundant storage volumes.\nWindows 2000 can be installed and deployed to an enterprise through either an attended or unattended installation. Unattended installations rely on the use of answer files to fill in installation information, and can be performed through a bootable CD using Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), by the System Preparation Tool (Sysprep).\nHistory.\nWindows 2000 was created from the Microsoft Windows NT operating system versions. It was originally called Windows NT 5.0 but Microsoft changed the name to Windows 2000 on October 27, 1998. The first software test version (also known as a beta version) for Windows 2000 was released on September 27, 1997. Several more test versions were released until Beta 3, which was released on April 29, 1999. Microsoft further issued three more test versions from between July to November 1999. They then finally released Windows 2000 to partners on December 12, 1999 . The public received the full version of Windows 2000 on February 17, 2000 and the press immediately called it the most stable operating system Microsoft had ever released. Novell (a competitor of Microsoft) did not think that Microsoft's new directory service product (part of Windows 2000) was as good as their own Novell Directory Services (NDS) technology . On September 29, 2000, Microsoft released Windows 2000 Datacenter. Microsoft released Service Pack 1 (SP1) on August 15, 2000, Service Pack 2 (SP2) on May 16, 2001, Service Pack 3 (SP3) on August 29, 2002 and its last Service Pack (SP4) on June 26, 2003. Microsoft has said that they will not release a Service Pack 5, but instead, have offered an \"Update Rollup\" for Service Pack 4. Microsoft stopped developing their Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for Windows 2000 in Service Pack 3.\nMicrosoft has replaced Windows 2000 Professional with Windows XP Professional, and Windows 2000 Server products with Windows Server 2003. A project code named \"Neptune\" started development in 1999. Neptune was based on Windows 2000, and it was supposed to be a home-user replacement for Windows 98. However, the project took a long time to create and only one pre-test (alpha version) release was created. Windows Me was released instead, and the Neptune project later turned into part of a project that became Windows XP. The only elements of the Neptune project which were included in Windows 2000 were the ability to upgrade from Windows 95 or Windows 98, and support for the FAT32 file system.\nSeveral notable security flaws have been found in Windows 2000. Code Red and Code Red II were famous computer worms that used problems with the indexing service from Windows 2000's Internet Information Services (IIS) to cause security problems. In August 2003, two major worms named the Sobig worm and the Blaster worm began to attack millions of Microsoft Windows computers and caused many problems for system administrators and computer operators who used Windows 2000. This was very embarrassing for Microsoft, and caused many corporations and governments to look carefully at Microsoft's security problems.\nWindows 2000 is the last version of Windows that does not require any Pentium instructions, and is therefore the last version that will run on an Intel i486."}

The devices are mostly electrical or mechanical. Someone that invents new ideas or methods on how to do things may also be called an inventor. Inventors can receive a patent.\nMany inventors make small changes to old inventions. For example, people have invented new ways to make clocks over history. Early clocks were sundials, later clocks used water, and pendulums. Modern clocks are often electronic. Other machines such as vehicles are made of many inventions."}

They form the family Ursidae, in the suborder Caniformia of the order Carnivora. There are 8 living bear species.\nAppearance.\nBears usually have a big body with short and thick legs. They have a broad head and a very short tail. They have small eyes and round ears. They usually have longer, shaggy fur. On each foot they have five claws, which they cannot pull back. They use their claws for digging, climbing, and hunting. They can stand up on their back legs and their front paws are flexible. Usually bears can climb and swim very well. Males are usually bigger than females. Most bears except the giant panda are only one color. Most bears are russet, brown, or black.\nBears do not have good hearing. They have powerful senses of smell and sight. They have good sight and can see colors, which is different from other carnivores. Bears mostly use their sense of smell to know what is around them. They can smell better than dogs. Bears also have good memory, which lets them remember where they can find food.\nLife.\nThey are mostly active at night, except for the Polar Bear. Some bears hibernate, that means they sleep during the winter to save energy.\nBears are usually omnivorous, which means that they eat plants and meat. They eat berries, grass, and fish. An exception is the polar bear, which eats mostly meat.\nBears usually live alone, except when they are mating season or if they have cubs. The father does not raise the cubs. The mother raises the cubs for months or a few years depending on how much food there is. The mother protects her young, even at the cost of her life.\nDistribution.\nBears live all over the world, mostly in the Northern hemisphere. They are found in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. There used to be bears in northern Africa but they are now extinct.\nIn popular culture.\nFictional bears include, Yogi Bear, Berenstain Bears, and Winnie the Pooh."}

{"id": "15244", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15244", "title": "Whale shark", "text": "The whale shark (\"Rhincodon typus\"), is a filter feeding shark. It is the largest shark in the world. It grows up to 12\u00a0metres long, and may weigh as much as 47,000\u00a0pounds.\nThe whale shark has a very wide distribution, found in all tropical and warm temperate seas, except in the Mediterranean.\nDescription.\nThe whale shark has a streamlined body and a wide, flattened head. The mouth is transverse, very large and is nearly at the tip of the snout. The gill slits are also very large, and are designed as filtering screens. The first dorsal fin is much larger than the second dorsal fin, and is located at the back of the body. The caudal fin is semi-lunate (crescent-shaped) in adults, and with the young, the upper lobe is quite longer than the lower lobe. The whale shark has a unique \"checkerboard\" colour pattern of light spots and stripes on a dark background.\nWhale sharks are grey, blue or brown above, with a surface pattern of creamy white spots between pale, vertical and horizontal stripes. The belly is white. The use of the strange pattern on the whale shark is unknown, although many bottom-dwelling Whale sharks use these markings as a camouflage against their backgrounds.\nThey can be as long as 41\u00a0feet (12.3\u00a0metres) in length, and weigh as much as 47,000\u00a0pounds (21.5 tonnes). However, it is believed that there are some whale sharks which can reach lengths of up to 67\u00a0feet (20\u00a0metres). The smallest free-living individuals are around 55\u00a0cm (21.7\u00a0inches) long. Whale sharks reach maturity at lengths of around 8\u20139\u00a0metres. They are the largest species of fish, and the largest animal that isn't a cetacean (whale).\nDistribution.\nThe whale shark has a very widespread distribution, found in all tropical and warm temperate seas, except in the Mediterranean. It is found throughout the Atlantic Ocean, from New York, through the Caribbean, to central Brazil, and from Senegal to the Gulf of Guinea. It also is found in the Indian Ocean, throughout the region, including the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. In the Pacific Ocean it is found from Japan to Australia, off Hawaii, and from California to Chile.\nAlthough other shark species of the order Orectolobiformes are benthic (live on or near the bottom), the whale shark lives in the pelagic zone. Studies show that this shark prefers warm waters, with surface temperatures of around 21-30\u00a0\u00b0C. It is often seen offshore but commonly comes close inshore, sometimes entering lagoons or coral atolls. Whale sharks sometimes swim deeper than 700\u00a0metres \nPredators.\nAlthough the whale shark has no real predator, young Whale sharks have been found in the stomachs of Blue sharks and Blue marlin.\nBehaviour.\nIn spite of its large size, the whale shark is timid. Divers usually hold onto the tails of these sharks and swim with them, and the whale sharks never seem to attack.\nThere is some risk that a diver getting too close to a whale shark could get sucked into the filtering system that the sharks use for feeding. Another risk is that they can create problems for small boats that they may accidentally knock into. For the sharks, contact with very large boats can result in severe injuries.\nFeeding.\nWith the basking shark and the megamouth shark, the whale shark is one of the three known species of filter feeding sharks. It feeds mainly on plankton and nekton, small crustaceans, schooling fish, and sometimes on small tuna and squids. Whale sharks may also sometimes feed on phytoplankton and macroalgae. Unlike most plankton-feeding vertebrates, the whale shark does not depend on slow forward motion to operate its filtration mechanism. Instead, it relies on a versatile suction filter-feeding methodology, which allows it to draw in a larger amount of water than other filter-feeders, such as the Starfish. This allows the whale shark to capture larger amounts of plankton. Whale sharks are always seen feeding in a vertical or near vertical position with the head at or near the surface.\nOther food items for the whale shark can include krill, and the larvae of Christmas Island red crab.\nReproduction.\nThere is very little information that has been documented about whale sharks mating and giving birth to young. Some whale sharks which live in captivity are studied by scientists but the whale shark is not very common in aquariums due to its large size.\nHowever, it is believed that they can have up to 300 pups at a time. This would be considerably more than other shark species, yet only a small fraction of them live to the age of maturity. It is believed that this species of shark doesn\u2019t mate until it is about 30 years old. They can live from 70 to 100 years of age.\nHuman use.\nIn the past, the whale shark has been of little interest to fisheries. Now, commercial fishing for whale sharks are limited, but may expand from an increased demand for food products. In Taiwan around 100 whale sharks are caught annually. The meat of the whale shark is sold for high prices in this country, and since of this, there have been larger harvests of whale sharks over the last few years. Fishing for this shark also occurs in the Philippines, particularly in the Visayas and Mindanao areas, providing food for the local fishing communities. Whale shark fins are sold in the Orient, especially in Hong Kong. Occasionally, whale sharks are captured accidentally along the coast of India. Sometimes the flesh is eaten and the liver oil is used for waterproofing wooden fishing boats and for the manufacture of shoe polish, and it is also used as a treatment for some skin diseases. The fins of Whale sharks are also sold in India. Often, the whale shark is used as an indicator of waters which are rich in plankton-feeding fish that will, in turn, attract more valuable species, such as tuna. Whale sharks have been kept in aquaria in Japan, but their large size and their diet has made it hard to keep a whale shark in an aquarium. Some locations where the presence of whale sharks appears to be predictable, are increasingly targeted by commercial tourist operations.\nConservation.\nSome biological characteristics, such as the slow growth, and long time to mature, makes the whale shark vulnerable to overfishing. These characteristics also suggest that populations are slow to recover from any overfishing. The whale shark is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. The whale shark is listed by the AFS (American Fisheries Society) as \"Conservation dependent\" (meaning that the whale shark's population has reduced but it is recovering under conservation plans) in both the Atlantic waters of the U.S.A, and the Gulf of Mexico. However, it is considered not at risk in the Gulf of California. In the Maldives and Philippines there has been a ban on the fishing of whale sharks. This protection was introduced because of the serious impact that the fisheries may be making on whale shark numbers. The predictable occurrence of whale sharks in a few areas, such as western Australia, has led to the development of an expanding tourism industry. In this area the whale shark is a protected species and its tourism has been managed through a controlled system, including the licensing of a limited number of operators tours. Also, divers have been stopped from riding, chasing, or harassing any marine animal in any way, including whale sharks. Recently, some studies made on the Ningaloo Reef's whale sharks provided information that regular diving is a normal behaviour of these sharks, and there is no avoidance reaction during contact with humans."}
{"id": "15245", "revid": "487619", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15245", "title": "Qatar", "text": "Qatar (, , or ; ' ; local vernacular pronunciation: ), officially the State of Qatar ( '), is a sovereign country in Western Asia. It is on the small Qatar Peninsula on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Its only land border is with Saudi Arabia to the south, with the rest of its territory surrounded by the Persian Gulf. A strait in the Persian Gulf separates Qatar from the nearby island country of Bahrain, as well as sharing maritime borders with the United Arab Emirates and Iran.\nFollowing Ottoman rule, Qatar became a British protectorate in the early 20th century until gaining independence in 1971. Qatar has been ruled by the House of Thani since the early 19th century. Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani was the founder of the State of Qatar. Qatar is a hereditary monarchy and its head of state is Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Whether it should be called a constitutional or an absolute monarchy is a matter of opinion. In 2003, the constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, with almost 98% in favour. As of early 2017, Qatar's total population was around 2.6 million: 313,000 Qatari citizens and 2.3 million expatriates.\nQatar is a high income economy and is a developed country, with the world's third largest natural gas reserves and oil reserves. The country has the highest per capita income in the world. Qatar is classified by the UN as a country of very high human development and is the most advanced Arab state for human development. Qatar is a significant power in the Arab world, supporting several rebel groups during the Arab Spring both financially and through its globally expanding media group, Al Jazeera Media Network. For its small size, Qatar has a lot of influence in the world, and has been identified as a middle power. Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first Arab country to do so.\nQatar is either a constitutional or an absolute monarchy ruled by the Al Thani family. The Al Thani dynasty has been ruling Qatar since the family house was established in 1825. In 2003, Qatar adopted a constitution that provided for the direct election of 30 of the 45 members of the Legislative Council. The constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, with almost 98% in favour.\nThe eighth Emir of Qatar is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, whose father Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani handed power to him on June 25, 2013. The supreme chancellor has the exclusive power to appoint and remove the prime minister and cabinet ministers who, together, constitute the Council of Ministers, which is the supreme executive authority in the country. The Council of Ministers also initiates legislation. Laws and decrees proposed by the Council of Ministers are referred to the Advisory Council (Majilis Al Shura) for discussion after which they are submitted to the Emir for ratification. A Consultative Assembly has limited power to draft and approve laws, but the Emir has final say on all matters. The current Council is made up entirely of members appointed by the Emir, as no legislative elections have been held since 1970 when there were partial elections to the body. Legislative elections are expected to be held in 2016.\nQatari law does not permit the establishment of political bodies or trade unions.\nSharia law.\nSharia law is the main source of Qatari legislation according to Qatar's Constitution. In practice, Qatar's legal system is a mixture of civil law and Sharia law. Sharia law is applied to laws pertaining to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts (including adultery, robbery and murder). In some cases in Sharia-based family courts, a female's testimony is worth half a man's. Codified family law was introduced in 2006. Islamic polygamy is allowed in the country.\nFlogging is used in Qatar as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations. Article 88 of Qatar's criminal code declares the punishment for adultery is 100 lashes. In 2006, a Filipino woman was sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery. In 2010, at least 18 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to flogging of between 40 and 100 lashes for offences related to \"illicit sexual relations\" or alcohol consumption. In 2011, at least 21 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to floggings of between 30 and 100 lashes for offences related to \"illicit sexual relations\" or alcohol consumption. In 2012, six expatriates were sentenced to floggings of either 40 or 100 lashes. Only Muslims considered medically fit were liable to have such sentences carried out. It is unknown if the sentences were implemented. More recently in April 2013, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for alcohol consumption. In June 2014, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for consuming alcohol and driving under the influence. Judicial corporal punishment is common in Qatar due to the Hanbali interpretation of Sharia Law.\nStoning is a legal punishment in Qatar. Apostasy is a crime punishable by the death penalty in Qatar. Blasphemy is punishable by up to seven years in prison and proselytizing can be punished by up to 10 years in prison. Homosexuality is a crime punishable by the death penalty.\nAlcohol consumption is partially legal in Qatar; some five-star luxury hotels are allowed to sell alcohol to their non-Muslim customers. Muslims are not allowed to consume alcohol in Qatar and Muslims caught consuming alcohol are liable to flogging or deportation. Non-Muslim expatriates can obtain a permit to purchase alcohol for personal consumption. The Qatar Distribution Company (a subsidiary of Qatar Airways) is permitted to import alcohol and pork; it operates the one and only liquor store in the country, which also sells pork to holders of liquor licences. Qatari officials have also indicated a willingness to allow alcohol in \"fan zones\" at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nUntil recently, restaurants on the Pearl-Qatar (a man-made island near Doha) were allowed to serve alcoholic drinks. In December 2011, however, restaurants on the Pearl were told to stop selling alcohol. No explanation was given for the ban. Speculation about the reason includes the government's desire to project a more pious image in advance of the country's first election of a royal advisory body and rumours of a financial dispute between the government and the resort's developers.\nIn 2014, Qatar launched a modesty campaign to remind tourists of the modest dress code. Female tourists are advised not to wear leggings, miniskirts, sleeveless dresses and short or tight clothing in public. Men are advised against wearing only shorts and singlets.\nHuman rights.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, expatriate workers from nations throughout Asia and parts of Africa voluntarily migrate to Qatar as low-skilled laborers or domestic servants, but some subsequently face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude. Some of the more common labor rights violations include beatings, withholding of payment, charging workers for benefits for which the employer is responsible, restrictions on freedom of movement (such as the confiscation of passports, travel documents, or exit permits), arbitrary detention, threats of legal action, and sexual assault. Many migrant workers arriving for work in Qatar have paid exorbitant fees to recruiters in their home countries.\nAs of 2014, certain provisions of the Qatari Criminal Code allows punishments such as flogging and stoning to be imposed as criminal sanctions. The UN Committee Against Torture found that these practices constituted a breach of the obligations imposed by the UN Convention Against Torture. Qatar retains the death penalty, mainly for threats against national security. Use of the death penalty is rare and no state executions have taken place in Qatar since 2003.\nUnder the provisions of Qatar's sponsorship law, sponsors have the unilateral power to cancel workers' residency permits, deny workers' ability to change employers, report a worker as \"absconded\" to police authorities, and deny permission to leave the country. As a result, sponsors may restrict workers' movements and workers may be afraid to report abuses or claim their rights. According to the ITUC, the visa sponsorship system allows the exaction of forced labour by making it difficult for a migrant worker to leave an abusive employer or travel overseas without permission. Qatar also does not maintain wage standards for its immigrant labourers. Qatar commissioned international law firm DLA Piper to produce a report investigating the immigrant labour system. In May 2014 DLA Piper released over 60 recommendations for reforming the kafala system including the abolition of exit visas and the introduction of a minimum wage which Qatar has pledged to implement.\nIn May 2012, Qatari officials declared their intention to allow the establishment of an independent trade union. Qatar also announced it will scrap its sponsor system for foreign labour, which requires that all foreign workers be sponsored by local employers. Additional changes to labour laws include a provision guaranteeing that all workers' salaries are paid directly into their bank accounts and new restrictions on working outdoors in the hottest hours during the summer. New draft legislation announced in early 2015 mandates that companies that fail to pay workers' wages on time could temporarily lose their ability to hire more employees.\nIn October 2015 Qatar's Emir signed into law new reforms to the country's sponsorship system, with the new law taking effect within one year. Critics claim that the changes could fail to address some labour rights issues.\nThe country enfranchised women at the same time as men in connection with the 1999 elections for a Central Municipal Council. These elections\u2014the first ever in Qatar\u2014were deliberately held on March 8, 1999, International Women's Day.\nForeign relations.\nAs a small country with larger neighbors, Qatar seeks to project influence and protect its state and ruling dynasty. The history of Qatar's alliances provides insight into the basis of their policy. Between 1760 and 1971, Qatar sought formal protection from the high transitory powers of the Ottomans, British, the Al-Khalifa's from Bahrain, the Arabians, and the Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia. Qatar's rising international profile and active role in international affairs has led some analysts to identify it as a middle power. Qatar was an early member of OPEC and a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). It is a member of the Arab League. The country has not accepted compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction.\nQatar also has bilateral relationships with a variety of foreign powers. Qatar hosts the Al Udeid Air Base, a joint U.S.-British base, which acts as the hub for all American and British air operations in the Persian Gulf. It has allowed American and British forces to use an air base to send supplies to Iraq and Afghanistan. Despite hosting this strategic military installation, Qatar is not always a strong Western ally. Qatar has allowed the Afghan Taliban to set up a political office inside the country and has close ties to Iran, including a shared natural gas field. According to leaked documents published in \"The New York Times\", Qatar's record of counter-terrorism efforts was the \"worst in the region\". The cable suggested that Qatar's security service was \"hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals\".\nQatar has mixed relations with its neighbors in the Persian Gulf region. Qatar signed a defence co-operation agreement with Iran, with whom it shares the largest single non-associated gas field in the world. It was the second nation, the first being France, to have publicly announced its recognition of the Libyan opposition's National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya amidst the 2011 Libyan civil war.\nIn 2014, Qatar's relations with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates came to a boiling point over Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood and extremist groups in Syria.\nThis culminated in the three aforementioned countries withdrawing their ambassadors from Qatar in March 2014. When the ambassadors withdrew, the GCC was reportedly on the verge of a crisis linked to the emergence of distinct political blocs with conflicting interests. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain were engaged in a political struggle with Qatar, while Oman and Kuwait represent a non-aligned bloc within the GCC. Relations between the countries improved after the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) announced Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE returned their diplomats to Qatar. Islam Hassan, a researcher in Persian Gulf Studies at Qatar University, claims that, with the resolution of the GCC crisis, Qatar reached a new level of political maturity. He goes on to assert that Qatar managed to bring an end to the crisis without changing any of its foreign policy principles or abandoning its allies.\nIn recent years, Qatar has been using Islamist militants in a number of countries including Egypt, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Mali to further its foreign policy. Courting Islamists from the Muslim Brotherhood to Salafist groups has served as a power amplifier for the country, as it believes since the beginning of the Arab Spring that these groups represented the wave of the future. David Cohen, the Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the U.S. Treasury, said that Qatar is a \"permissive jurisdiction for terrorist financing.\" There is evidence that these groups supported by Qatar include the hard-line Islamic militant groups active in northern Syria. , Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are openly backing the Army of Conquest, an umbrella group of anti-government forces fighting in the Syrian Civil War that reportedly includes an al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front and another Salafi coalition known as Ahrar ash-Sham.\nQatar supported the democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi with diplomatic support and the state-owned Al Jazeera network before he was deposed in a military coup. Qatar offered Egypt a $7.5 billion loan during the year he was in power.\nQatar's alignment with Hamas, first reported in early 2012, has drawn criticism from Israel, the United States, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, \"who accuse Qatar of undermining regional stability by supporting Hamas.\" However, the Foreign Minister of Qatar has denied supporting Hamas, stating \"We do not support Hamas but we support the Palestinians.\" Following a peace agreement, Qatar pledged $1 billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nQatar has hosted academic, religious, political, and economic conferences. The 11th annual Doha Forum recently brought in key thinkers, professionals of various backgrounds, and political figures from all over the world to discuss democracy, media and information technology, free trade, and water security issues. In addition, the forum has featured the Middle East Economic Future conference since 2006. In more recent times, Qatar has hosted peace talks between rival factions across the globe. Notable among these include the Darfur Agreement. The Doha Declaration is the basis of the peace process in Darfur and it has achieved significant gains on the ground for the African region. Notable achievements included the restoration of security and stability, progress made in construction and reconstruction processes, return of displaced residents and uniting of Darfur people to face challenges and push forward the peace process. Qatar donated \u00a388.5million in funds to finance recovery and reconstruction in Darfur.\nMilitary.\nThe Qatar Armed Forces are the military forces of Qatar. The country maintains a modest military force of approximately 11,800 men, including an army (8,500), navy (1,800) and air force (1,500). Qatar's defence expenditures accounted for approximately 4.2% of gross national product in 1993. In 2008 Qatar spent US$2.355 billion on military expenditures, 2.3% of the gross domestic product. Qatari special forces have been trained by France and other Western countries, and are believed to possess considerable skill. They also helped the Libyan rebels during the 2011 Battle of Tripoli.\nQatar has signed defence pacts with the United States and United Kingdom, as well as with France earlier in 1994. Qatar plays an active role in the collective defence efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council; the other five members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman. The presence of a large Qatari Air Base, operated by the United States and several other UN nations, provides a guaranteed source of defence and national security.\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that in 2010\u201314 Qatar was the 46th largest arms importer in the world. However, SIPRI writes, Qatar's plans to transform and significantly enlarge its armed forces have accelerated. Orders in 2013 for 62 tanks and 24 self-propelled guns from Germany were followed in 2014 by a number of other contracts, including 24 combat helicopters and 3 AEW aircraft from the USA, and 2 tanker aircraft from Spain.\nQatar's military participated in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis. In 2015, \"Al Jazeera America\" reported: \"Numerous reports suggest that the Saudi-led coalition against opposition groups in Yemen has indiscriminately attacked civilians and used cluster bombs in civilian-populated areas, in violation of international law.\"\nAdministrative divisions.\nSince 2004, Qatar has been divided into seven municipalities (Arabic: baladiyah).\nFor statistical purposes, the municipalities are further subdivided into 98 zones (), which are in turn subdivided into blocks.\nGeography.\nQatar is a peninsula (a strip of land sticking out into the sea). It is joined to Saudi Arabia to the south, and all the other sides of it are surrounded by the waters of the Arabian Gulf.\nQatar is quite a small country and has an area of only 10,360\u00a0km\u00b2. The peninsula is 160\u00a0km long. Much of the country is a low, barren plain, covered with sand. The Jebel Dukhan area has Qatar\u2019s main onshore oil deposits. The natural gas fields lie offshore, to the northwest of the peninsula.\nThe capital of Qatar is Doha. Over 90% of the people live in Doha. The other large city is Al Wakrah.\nGovernment and politics.\nQatar has an unelected, monarchic, emirate-type government. The position of emir is hereditary.\nThe Emir is the only one who can appoint and remove the prime minister and cabinet ministers. Together the ministers make up the Council of Ministers. They are the highest executive authority in the country.\nPeople and culture.\nPeople from Qatar are called Qataris. They are Arabs. The official language of Qatar is Arabic, but many people also speak English, especially when they are doing business.\nAbout 2.6 million people live in Qatar; however, about 88% of these are \"guest workers\" (people from another country who are living and working there for a short time), mostly coming from South Asia, South East Asia and other Arab countries. 650,000 are Indians, 350,000 Nepalis, 260,000 Filipinos among a lot of other nationalities.\nNearly all of Qatar's economy comes from producing petroleum and natural gas.\nThe currency of Qatar is called the Qatari Riyal.\nAlmost all Qataris follow the religion of Islam. However, many of the guest workers follow other religions.\nSport.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Qatar, closely followed by cricket. The Qatar under-20 national football team finished second in the 1981 FIFA World Youth Championship.\nThe Asian Football Confederation's 2011 AFC Asian Cup finals were held in Qatar in January 2011.

It often means the water from the seas (sea water) and oceans. Almost all the water on Earth is saline.\nSalt water used for making or preserving food, is usually saltier than sea water and is called brine. Drinking sea water alone is dangerous. A summary of 163 life raft voyages showed the risk of death at 39% for those who drank seawater, compared to 3% for those who did not. Experiments on rats showed the danger.\nWhen scientists measure salt in water, they usually say they are testing the salinity of the water: salinity is measured in \"parts per thousand\" or \"ppt\". Most sea water is about 35 ppt salt. Salt lakes can be up to ten times as salty. Above that level precipitation creates a salt plain.\nBrackish water, in contrast, is less salty than seawater.\nSalt water is more dense than fresh water. This means that it has more matter per its volume. Fresh water has a density of 1 g/ml, while salty seawater has an average density of about 1.025 g/ml."}

And he wrote a lot about writers he loved, such as James Joyce, a novelist, and Gerard Manley Hopkins, a poet.\nBurgess was born in Harpurhey, Manchester, in the north of England. Before he became a writer, he was a soldier, then a teacher. When he was 37 years old, he left his home country to work in Malaysia and Brunei. Later, he lived in the USA, Italy, and France.\nHe was born very poor, the son of a man who made a meagre living out of selling cigarettes to workmen. But when Burgess died, he had grown rich. This was because he worked so hard at his art, which is the art of literature. He wrote at least 1,000 words every day of his life. But he always found time to be kind to other writers. He was friendly to the many people who came to visit with him at his seaside home in Monaco.\nBurgess died of lung cancer aged 76, in St John's Wood, London.\nThe books by Burgess that people say they like the most are called \"Earthly Powers\", about the Pope; \"Enderby\", about a poet; and \"Nothing Like the Sun\", about William Shakespeare."}
{"id": "15254", "revid": "1078549", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15254", "title": "Rape", "text": "Rape is usually defined as having sexual intercourse with a person who does not want to, or cannot consent. Consent is when someone agrees of their own choice without being forced to. In France it is more widely defined as 'unwanted sexual penetration'. Rape is a form of sexual assault. In most countries, rape is one of the most serious crimes. The International Criminal Court can also condemn it as a \"crime against humanity\", if done by a group. A person who rapes someone is a rapist. Rapists may use violence, drugs, or threats to get their way. People of any gender can be raped. This was not recognized by the United States law until 2011. Girls and women or boys and men may stay quiet about a rape because they might feel ashamed about it. Rapists can be both male or female but are usually male.\nPeople who cannot consent.\nA person may be unable to consent (say yes to) to sexual intercourse or other sexual activity. Having sex with a person who cannot consent is rape.\nAdults who cannot consent.\nSome adults are unable to consent to sex.\nMarital rape.\nMarital rape is where the victim of rape is married to the person committing the rape. Unconsenting sex with a married partner is thought to be rape under the laws of some countries but not others. In the United Kingdom, marital rape was determined to be a crime in the case of \"R v. R\" (1991). Marital rape being illegal does not mean that the law is enforced. For example, in Ireland marital rape was made illegal in 1990, but by 2006 only one person had been convicted of it.\nEffects of rape.\nRape is a medical emergency. People who are raped may be injured or have a sexually transmitted disease (STD). People may not know they are hurt or sick. Doctors can give medicine to treat an STD. HIV, an STD, can be prevented by early treatment. If seen quickly, a doctor can give medication called emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy. Rape is at least twice as likely to cause pregnancy as consensual sex. The reason for this is not known.\nAt the hospital, police can collect evidence from the victim and his/her clothing. Evidence may help find the rapist, and can help the police send him or her to jail. Waiting too long makes it hard to collect evidence. Also, taking a shower before telling the police or going to a hospital can wash off some of the DNA evidence.\nVictims of rape often feel scared, sad, and/or guilty. They may think about the rape a lot, even when they do not want to. They may have nightmares about the rape. Many have post-traumatic stress disorder. People who are raped during childhood or adolescence often get borderline personality disorder. They may binge drink to cope. Talking to someone, like a counselor, can help. Rape counselors are trained to help rape victims. Sometimes doctors can give medicine to decrease fear and sadness. Calling a rape crisis center or hotline can help a victim find help.\nRape culture.\nSome people believe in 'rape culture'. For example, they say that the United States has a rape culture. Rape culture is a culture that lets rape happen. It even encourages it. In the US 97% of rapists are never put in prison for their crimes. Some people are worried about women lying about being raped and men getting unfairly punished. This happens much less often than people think. In a study of college athletes, they thought that women lie about being raped 50% of the time. A 2005 study by the British Home Office found that 2.5% of rape reports were false.\nPart of rape culture is victim blaming. This is when people say that someone who has been raped is the person to blame for their rape. An example of this is people saying that a rape victim was 'asking for it' because they were wearing a short skirt. It can also be more subtle. Victim blaming has been linked to the just world fallacy. This is when people think that the world is fair, so bad things only happen to people who have done something wrong. Victim-blaming is also related to 'slut-shaming'.\nThe idea of rape culture has been criticized. Christina Hoff Sommers argues that rape is just one type of violent crime and America's culture of violence in general is what should be fought.\nStatistics.\nIt is not easy to find out how many people have been raped or how many people have raped. A lot of rape victims don't tell anyone that they were raped. They may be scared that they will not be believed or feel too ashamed to talk about what happened. The conviction rate for rape is very low so they might think reporting to police is a waste of time. The 2006-07 British Crime Survey found that 1 in every 200 women suffered from rape in that period. The same year 800 people were convicted of rape. This means less than 1 in every 100 reports of rape led to a conviction. A survey by Mumsnet found that 68% of women would hesitate reporting a rape to the police because of low conviction rates.\nSo rape report statistics are not reliable. A person may be raped but deny or not realize that what happened to them is rape, so would not say 'yes' if they were asked in survey if they had been raped. A person is more likely to say they were raped or raped someone if the word 'rape' is not used in a survey question. Different countries have different legal definitions of rape. Marital rape or rape that is not male-female is not always counted in the law or statistics.\nSome studies ask what people think about rape instead of or as well of if they have raped or been raped. This comes from the idea that rape is a social problem.\nUnited States.\nOne in five women in the U.S. say they have been raped in their lives. One in three Native American women has been a victim of rape or attempted rape.\nOne in six men in the U.S. say they were raped or sexually abused before age 18.\nProstitutes have possibly the highest rape rate in the population. A 1996 study in San Francisco found that 70% of a sample of 200 female prostitutes had been raped.\nUnited Kingdom.\nOpinion Matters surveyed a random sample of 1061 people in London aged 18 to 50 online. 20% had been raped (23% of 712 women and 15% of 349 men).\nIn a 2005 poll 26% of people thought that a woman is partly or fully responsible for her rape if she was wearing sexy clothing. 4% thought that there are more than 10,000 women raped a year.\n60% of 1000 women in a Rape Crisis survey thought that rape is not rape if the woman does not say 'no'. 16% had been raped.\nA 2009 study by NSPCC found that 1 in 16 girls between the age of 13 and 17 who were in relationships had been raped.\nIn a survey between 2010 and 2012 of adults living in Britain, 9.8% of women said they had been raped and 1.4% of men said they had been raped.\nIn 2013 the 'Savile effect' was described in the media. In 2012 there was a lot of media coverage about claims of child sexual abuse against Jimmy Savile. The number of sex crimes reported to police increased 9%. This was linked to the sexual abuse scandal.\nFinland.\nIn Finland convicted rapists get very short sentences compared to other countries. Between 2001 and 2003 the average sentence for rape was two years in prison.\nAsia/Pacific.\nIn 2013 a study by the United Nations was published that asked 10,178 men in six countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka) if they had raped a woman who was not their partner. Over one in 10 said yes. When they were asked if they had raped a woman who was their partner, 1 in 4 said yes, making headlines. The highest rate was 62% of men in Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea who said they had raped a woman. 7.6% had raped a man. 14% of men from the area had took part in gang rape.\n2.8% of the whole sample reported having raped another man.\nThe lowest rate was 10 per cent in urban Bangladesh. The majority of the men who had raped did not face any legal consequences. 42.7% had first raped between the age of 15 and 19.\n73% said they raped because of sexual entitlement. 59% said they did it for fun. 38% said they had raped a woman to punish her. Alcohol was the least common reason. Men who had been sexually abused were more likely to rape.\n20.8% of 1,863 Cambodian men had raped. Gang rape was the least common kind of rape in Cambodia. In Cambodia it was more common than non-partner rape by a rapist on their own. 81.7 percent of Cambodian women said that if a woman does not physically fight back it is not rape.\nOther research found that 87% of Cambodian girls and 87% of Cambodian boys don't think that gang rape of a prostitute by a group of men is wrong or actually rape.\n96.5% of Sri Lankan men who raped experienced no legal consequences.\n20% of 8000 Indian men in a survey by ICRW had committed marital rape.\nIn a survey by IUSSP 32% of Indian women said they had been raped in their lives. The conviction rate for rape in India is 24.21%.\nSouth Africa.\nSouth Africa has been described as the rape capital of the world. In a study in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal by the South African Medical Research Council over one in four of 1737 anonymously surveyed men said that they had raped. 4.6% had raped and 5.3% had attempted rape in the last year. 16.8% had attempted rape ever. 8.9% had engaged in gang rape in their lives. 46.3% of men who had raped had raped more than one woman or girl and 53.9% had raped more than once. 7.1% raped 6-10. 7.7% said they had raped more than ten women or girls. 45% did not feel guilty. 9.8% of rapists were under 10 years old and 16.4% were 10\u201314 years old the first time they raped a girl of woman. However the sample contained more young men than the general population. The men who raped were much more likely to have experienced bullying and bad relationships with their parents. The most common reason given by the rapists for raping was entitlement.\nIn another study in Gauteng, South Africa's wealthiest province, over 1 in 3 (37.4%) of the 487 men asked admitted to rape. Two thirds of men said they raped because of feeling entitled to sex. Other reasons given were that they wanted to have fun or to punish a woman. 25.3% of 511 women said they had been raped.\nCommunity Information, Empowerment and Transparency (CIET) Africa says that in 1998, one in three of the 4,000 women they asked in Johannesburg were raped.\nA 2013 study of grade-nine boys at 46 secondary schools in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth found that 17.2% had raped.\nA study of 1370 rural South African men aged 15\u201326 from 70 villages found that 21% had raped. The average age of first rape was 17.\nOther very different statistics have been reported.\nIn \"The South African demographic and health survey of 1998\" 4% of women aged 15 to 49 said they had been raped. The reason for the differences in the statistics are not known. Rape between men is not part of the legal rape definition in South Africa.\nLesotho.\nIn a study of 1,049 women in Lesotho, 33% said they had been raped by the age of 18. In 66% of cases the rapist was a boyfriend.\nTanzania.\nA study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city, found that 1 out of 5 women over the age of 12 (the age group studied) have been raped. 10% had reported their rapes to police.\nDemocratic Republic of Congo.\nA 2010 study estimated that 1,100 women are raped every day in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a statistic 26 times higher than the previous estimate.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/05/2011511231649539962.html\nAn analysis of 2,565 patients who received medical care in the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res sexual violence clinic in Ituri found that 96% were female. 73% were raped by armed men. 95.2% of the male victims were raped by armed men. 35.9% of females who were asked if they had became pregnant as a result of their rape said yes. 74.5% experienced gang rape (89.3% of male and 73.9% of female victims), usually involving 2-4 rapists. 48.6% of victims were raped while doing daily chores outside the home like collecting water and 12.3% in their own homes.\nBotswana.\n10.3% of women in Botswana said that they had been raped in a 2011 study. 3.9% of men said they had raped.\nSwaziland.\n5% of Swaziland men in a study had raped. 11.4% of women had been raped.\nEthiopia.\nA study in Addis Ababa of high school boys found that 4.3% had been raped in their lives.\nIn a sample of street females in Bahir-Dar town 24.3% had been raped in their lives and 11.4% were raped in the last year. 93.8% of the rapes were not reported. 19.1% became pregnant as a result of their rape.\nA study of 374 female students at Wolaita Sodo University found that 23.4% had experienced attempted rape and 8.7% had been raped.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) found among a sample of women in rural Ethiopia who had had sex, 17% said that the first time they had sex it was forced.\nGhana.\nIn a survey 8% of 2011 Ghanaian women had been raped. 5% of men had raped a wife or girlfriend.\nNigeria.\nOut of a sample of 295 female students from Ebonyi State University Abakaliki in Southeast Nigeria, 10.8% had been raped on campus. In another study of 12-19-year-old students from schools in Oyo State found that 68.3% of intellectually disabled females with sexual experience had been raped.\nIn a 2013 poll, 34% of 585 randomly chosen Nigerians said that 'indecent dressing' is the most common cause of rape in their society. 79% agreed with the statement 'most rapes in Nigeria go unreported'. In Nigeria raping someone you are married to (marital rape) is not recognized as a crime."}

His cult, of young women and men, was known as \"The Family.\"\nHe planned and ordered the Family to commit several brutal murders. Most known is the murder by his followers on August 8, 1969 of Sharon Tate. She was expecting a baby, already 7 / 8 months. The same night they also murdered Steven Parent, a friend of the groundskeeper at the house; Jay Sebring, a hair stylist; Abigail Folger, an heiress and social worker; and Wojciech Frykowski, a Polish writer and actor. The next night, Manson and some of his followers murdered Leno La Bianca, a grocery store owner and his wife Rosemary. Manson and his followers were arrested for stealing cars, but soon it was found out that they were the ones who committed the murders.\nManson was in jail for life in California. He and four Family members were sentenced to death, but the death penalty was abolished in California shortly after that. Because of his violent, murderous, anti-social behavior and unstable mental state, he was refused parole in 2012 for the 12th time. He was 77 years old at the time. His next hearing had been set for 2027.\nManson released an album titled . It featured Manson's music. All profits of the 2006 revived ESP-Disk label version go to the family of Wojciech Frykowski. Allmusic rated the album 4 out of 5 stars.\nManson \"Family\".\nManson was a convicted criminal long before the infamous murders. When he was released for the second time, on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half his 32 years in prisons and other institutions.p137 He told the authorities that prison had become his home and he asked to stay. This fact was disclosed in a 1981 television interview.\nOn his release day, Manson was allowed to move to San Francisco. With the help of a prison friend he moved into an apartment in Berkeley. While in prison, a bank robber taught him to play the steel guitar.p137 Living mostly by panhandling, he soon met Mary Brunner, a 23-year-old graduate of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Brunner was working as a library assistant at University of California, Berkeley, and Manson moved in with her. Someone said in a secondhand report that he managed to talk her into allowing other women to live with them, even though she was against it. Before long, they were sharing Brunner's home with 18 other women.p163\u2013174\nManson set himself up as a guru in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury. During 1967's \"Summer of Love,\" it was becoming the most popular place for hippies to live and hang out. Preaching a philosophy that included some of the Scientology he had studied in prison,p163 he soon had his first group of young followers, most of them female.p137 When Manson was put in prison in July 1961 at the U.S. penitentiary in McNeil Island, Washington, he put \"Scientologist\" as his religion on a questionnaire.p143\nBefore the summer ended, Manson and eight or nine of his followers began to travel around in an old school bus. They went as far north as Washington state, then south through Los Angeles, Mexico, and the southwest. Returning to the Los Angeles area, they lived in Topanga Canyon, Malibu, and Venice\u2014western parts of the city and county.p163\nMeeting Dennis Wilson.\nIn the late spring of 1968, in some reports of the events, Dennis Wilson, of the Beach Boys, picked up two hitchhiking Manson followers. They were Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey. Wilson brought them to his house in a rich neighborhood of Los Angeles for a few hours. After an all-night recording session, he came home in the early hours of the next morning. Wilson was greeted in his driveway by Manson, who came out of the house. Feeling afraid, Wilson asked the stranger if he was going to hurt him. Saying no, Manson then began to kiss Wilson's feet.p250p34\nInside his house, Wilson found 12 strangers (mostly women) who had moved in.p34 Over the next few months, the number of members moving in continued to grow. The Family members who had made themselves part of Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household cost him about $100,000. This included a large doctor's bill for treatment of their gonorrhea and $21,000 for wrecking his uninsured car, which they had borrowed.ch4 Wilson spent a lot of time singing and talking with Manson, whose women were treated like domestic workers.p250\nWilson paid for recording studio time to work on songs written and performed by Manson. He also introduced Manson to friends of his in the entertainment business. One was Terry Melcher (the son of Doris Day), who was also a musician and record producer. Gregg Jakobson, another friend, also paid to record Manson material. He later wrote about this experience with Manson for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. He used a fake name of \"Lance Fairweather\" for the article.\nIn his book \"Manson in His Own Words\", Manson says he first met Wilson at a friend's San Francisco house, where Manson had gone to buy cannabis. The drummer then gave Manson his Sunset Boulevard address and invited him to stop by when he would be in Los Angeles.\nSpahn Ranch.\nIn August 1968, Manson established a base for the group at Spahn's Movie Ranch, not far from Topanga Canyon, after Wilson's manager told the Family to move out of Wilson's home. The entire Family then relocated to the ranch.p253\nFamily members did helpful work around the grounds. Also, Manson ordered the Family's women (including Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme) to have sex occasionally with the nearly blind, 80-year-old owner George Spahn. The women also acted as seeing-eye guides for Spahn. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free.p99\nHelter Skelter.\nIn the first days of November 1968, Manson established the Family at alternative headquarters near Death Valley, where they occupied two unused or little-used ranches.ch10\nWhile back at Spahn Ranch, no later than December, Manson and Watson visited a Topanga Canyon acquaintance who played them the Beatles' \"White Album\", then recently released.ch12 Manson was obsessed with the group. At McNeil, he had told fellow inmates, including Alvin Karpis, that he could surpass the group in fame; to the Family, he spoke of the group as \"the soul\" and \"part of 'the hole in the infinite'.\u00a0\"\nFor some time, he had been saying that racial tension between blacks and whites was growing and that blacks would soon rise up in rebellion in America's cities. He had emphasized Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, which had taken place on April 4, 1968. On a bitterly cold New Year's Eve at Myers Ranch, the Family members, gathered outside around a large fire, listened as Manson explained that the social turmoil he had been predicting had also been predicted by the Beatles. The \"White Album\" songs, he declared, told it all, though in code. In fact, he said the album was directed at the Family itself, an elect group that was being instructed to preserve the worthy from the impending disaster.\nIn early January 1969, the Family escaped the desert's cold and positioned itself to monitor Los Angeles' supposed racial tension by moving to a canary-yellow home in Canoga Park, not far from the Spahn Ranch. Because this would allow the group to remain \"submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world\",p244 Manson called it the Yellow Submarine, another Beatles reference. There, Family members prepared for the impending apocalypse, which, around the campfire, Manson had termed \"Helter Skelter,\" after the song of that name.\nBy February, Manson's vision was complete. The Family would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the Beatles, would trigger the predicted chaos. Ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. Blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in \"the bottomless pit\"\u2014a secret city beneath Death Valley.\nAt the Canoga Park house, while Family members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album.ch13\nMurders.\nA total of eight people are known to have been killed by the Manson Family and two other killings are suspected.\nHinman murder.\nOn July 25, 1969, Manson sent Bobby Beausoleil, Mary Brunner, and Susan Atkins to the house of acquaintance Gary Hinman to persuade him to turn over money Manson thought Hinman had inherited.p75 The three held the uncooperative Hinman hostage for two days, during which Manson showed up with a sword to slash his ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, probably on Manson's instruction. Before leaving the Topanga Canyon residence, one of them used Hinman's blood to write \"Political piggy\" on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.p184\nTate murders.\nOn the night of August 8, Manson directed Charles Watson to take Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel to \"that house where Melcher used to live\" and \"totally destroy everyone in [it], as gruesome as you can.\"p463 He told the women to do as Watson would instruct them. Unknown to Manson, the tenants were now Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. Polanski was in Europe at the time and Tate was at home with three other people. They were all killed, as was a delivery boy who turned up at an inopportune moment.\nLa Bianca murders.\nThis event was the murder of a supermarket owner and his wife. On this occasion, Manson himself took charge of the murders and six Family members accompanied him. As with the other killings, there was no particular reason for the crime and the victims were unknown to the Family other than Manson.\nIllness and death.\nOn January 1, 2017, Manson was taken from Cochran State Prison to Mercy Hospital in downtown Bakersfield. He was suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Manson was seriously ill. Some reports suggest Manson was too weak for surgery. He was returned to prison by January 6. There was no report about whether he received any treatment.\nOn November 15, 2017, it was confirmed that Manson had returned to a hospital in Bakersfield. Four days later, he died at the hospital of natural causes and cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by colorectal cancer at the age of 83. It is currently unknown what fate his body will have."}

The batoids include four orders.\nThey are mostly flattened in shape, and usually demersal, living and eating at the bottom of the sea. The group first appears in the Triassic period, after 95% of marine species had been wiped out by the P/Tr extinction event.\nDescription.\nAppearance.\nRays look like bats in the water, and this is probably why they are called batoids. They have pectoral fins that are attached to their bodies from back to front, similar to the way a bat's wings attach from its shoulder to its feet.\nThe fins of the ray create a disk shape that can be round, triangular, or diamond-shaped. Rays use their pectoral fins to 'fly' through the water. Though a bony fish takes in water with its mouth, rays do not because they live at the bottom of the ocean. If they took in water through their mouths, they would probably just get a mouthful of sand. Because of this, they have breathing holes on top of their bodies called \"spiracles\". Rays use spiracles to take in water that is then sent over the gills.\nAlso, because they do not have a swim bladder, rays sink when they are not actively swimming.\nSocial Animals.\nInterestingly, rays are usually curious and social animals. Though they often live alone, they like swimming together in groups with other rays. Despite the fact that they are able to swim, most rays live at the bottom of the sea, eating benthic animals. In fact, they often flick sand on their backs to camouflage (disguise, or hide) themselves as they lie in the sand at the bottom of the ocean."}

They are in the family Scombridae, mostly in the genus Thunnus.\nTuna are fast swimmers. People have seen tuna swim at up to 77\u00a0km/h. Several species of tuna are warm-blooded. Most species of fish have white flesh. The flesh of the tuna is different. It is pink to dark red. This is because tuna muscle tissue contains greater quantities of myoglobin. Myoglobin is a molecule that binds oxygen. Some of the larger tuna species such as the Northern bluefin tuna can raise their blood temperature above the water temperature with muscular activity. This enables them to live in cooler waters and survive a wider range of circumstances.\nCommercial.\nTuna is an important commercial fish. Some varieties of tuna, such as the bluefin and bigeye tuna are threatened by overfishing, dramatically affecting tuna populations in the Atlantic and northwestern Pacific Oceans. Other populations seem to support fairly healthy fisheries (for example, the central and western Pacific skipjack tuna), but there is mounting evidence that overfishing threatens tuna fisheries worldwide.\nSome fishermen in Australia now grow Southern bluefin tuna in fish farms. Fish farms are areas of water with nets around them, where farmers raise (keep and grow animals) fish. Some tuna farms are circular nets 40 meters in diameter and 20 meters deep. The fishermen catch the tuna at sea, and then they keep the tuna in these farms. The tuna grow and get fatter for three to six months. There are also tuna farms in the Mediterranean, North America, and Japan that raise Northern bluefin tuna. Some environmental groups say that tuna farms use too much fish as food for the tuna, and that the farms pollute the water (make the water dirty).\nDiets.\nTuna are high up in the food chain. They eat animals that ate animals. Their diet leads to the accumulation of heavy metals in their flesh. Mercury levels can be relatively high in some of the larger species of tuna such as bluefin and albacore. As a result, in March 2004 the United States FDA issued guidelines recommending pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children to limit their intake of tuna and other types of predatory fish . However, most canned light tuna is skipjack tuna and is very low in mercury.\nSport fishermen like to catch tuna using rods and hooks.\nSpecies.\nThere are eight species:\nRelated pages.\nSpecies of several other genera (all in the family Scombridae) have common names containing \"tuna\":"}

It is sometimes called the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane.\nIts basic job is to separate the inside of cells from the outside.\nIn all cells, the cell membrane separates the cytoplasm inside the cell from its surroundings. Animal cells are contained in just a membrane. Bacteria, fungi and plants have strong cell walls as well, which support the cell and block the passage of large molecules.\nStructure.\nThe membrane is made up of a thin layer called the 'phospholipid bilayer'. This has two layers of phospholipid molecules with phosphate heads on the surfaces and lipid (oil) tails on the inside. The outside heads mix with water, but the tails reject water.\nOther proteins and lipids can be added to the cell membrane. By these changes, the cell can adjust what it brings in or puts out. Some proteins are always stuck into it, these are called \"integral\" membrane proteins. It also has some which are only sometimes stuck onto it. These are called peripheral membrane proteins. The outer layer protecting the inner cell.\nFunction.\nThe membrane is selectively permeable. It is active and regulates (adjusts) what comes in and what goes out of the cell.

These proteins mainly transport chemicals and information across the membrane.\nThe membrane contains many proteins. The surface proteins can act as gates. They let some chemicals into the cell and let other chemicals leave the cell. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane.

Geographically, Morocco is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior, large tracts of desert, and a lengthy coastline along the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean and\u00a0Mediterranean Sea.\nMorocco has a population of over 37 million and an area of 710,850\u00a0km2(274,460\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Its capital is\u00a0Rabat, and the largest city is\u00a0Casablanca. Other major cities include\u00a0Laayoune, Marrakesh,\u00a0Tangier,\u00a0Tetouan,\u00a0Sal\u00e9,\u00a0Fes,\u00a0Agadir,\u00a0Meknes,\u00a0Oujda,\u00a0Kenitra, and\u00a0Nador. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours. Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by\u00a0Idris I\u00a0in 789, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the\u00a0Almoravid\u00a0and\u00a0Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of\u00a0Iberia\u00a0and Northwestern Africa.\u00a0Marinid\u00a0and\u00a0Saadidynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North African country to avoid\u00a0Ottoman\u00a0occupation. The\u00a0Alaouite dynasty, the current ruling dynasty, seized power in 1666. In 1912 Morocco was divided into\u00a0French\u00a0and\u00a0Spanish protectorates, with an\u00a0international zone in Tangier, and regained its independence in 1956. Moroccan culture is a blend of\u00a0Arab,\u00a0indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African, and European influences.\nMorocco claims the\u00a0non-self-governing territory\u00a0of\u00a0Western Sahara\u00a0as its\u00a0Southern Provinces. Morocco liberated the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla war with the Polisario Front until a cease-fire in 1991.\u00a0Peace processes\u00a0have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.\nMorocco is a\u00a0constitutional monarchy\u00a0with an elected parliament. The\u00a0King of Morocco\u00a0holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the\u00a0military, foreign policy and religious affairs.\u00a0Executive power\u00a0is exercised by the\u00a0government, while\u00a0legislative power\u00a0is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the\u00a0Assembly of Representatives\u00a0and the\u00a0Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees called\u00a0dahirs\u00a0which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0and the president of the Constitutional court.\nMorocco's predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are\u00a0Arabic\u00a0and\u00a0Tamazight. The\u00a0Moroccan dialect, referred to as\u00a0\"Darija\", and\u00a0French\u00a0are also widely spoken. Morocco is a member of the\u00a0Arab League, the\u00a0Union for the Mediterranean, and the\u00a0African Union. It has the\u00a0fifth largest economy of Africa.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nThe Berber Roman client King\u00a0Ptolemy of Mauretania.\nThe area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since\u00a0Paleolithic times, sometime between 190,000 and 90,000\u00a0BC.\u00a0During the\u00a0Upper Paleolithic, the\u00a0Maghreb\u00a0was more fertile than it is today, resembling a\u00a0savanna\u00a0more than today's arid landscape.\u00a0Twenty-two thousand years ago, the\u00a0Aterian\u00a0was succeeded by the\u00a0Iberomaurusian\u00a0culture, which shared similarities with Iberian cultures. Skeletal similarities have been suggested between the\u00a0Iberomaurusian\u00a0\"Mechta-Afalou\" burials and European\u00a0Cro-Magnon\u00a0remains. The Iberomaurusian was succeeded by the\u00a0Beaker culture\u00a0in Morocco.\nMitochondrial DNA\u00a0studies have discovered a close link between\u00a0Berbers\u00a0and the\u00a0Saami\u00a0of Scandinavia. This supports theories that the\u00a0Franco-Cantabrian refuge area of southwestern Europe\u00a0was the source of late-glacial expansions of hunter-gatherers who repopulated northern Europe after the last\u00a0ice age.\nNorth Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging\u00a0Mediterranean\u00a0world by the\u00a0Phoenicians, who established trading colonies and settlements in the early Classical period. Substantial Phoenician settlements were at\u00a0Chellah,\u00a0Lixus\u00a0and\u00a0Mogador.Mogador was a Phoenician colony as early as the early 6th century BC.[\"\"]\nAncient Roman ruins of\u00a0Volubilis.\nMorocco later became a realm of the North African civilisation of\u00a0ancient Carthage\u00a0as part of its empire. The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the\u00a0Berber kingdom of Mauretania\u00a0under king\u00a0Baga.\u00a0This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the present state of\u00a0Mauritania) dates at least to 225\u00a0BC.\nMauretania\u00a0became a\u00a0client\u00a0kingdom of the\u00a0Roman Empire\u00a0in 33 BC. Emperor\u00a0Claudius\u00a0annexed Mauretania directly as a\u00a0Roman province\u00a0in 44 AD, under an imperial\u00a0governor\u00a0(either a\"procurator Augusti\", or a\u00a0\"legatus Augusti pro praetore\").\nDuring the\u00a0crisis of the 3rd century, parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berber tribes. Direct Roman rule became confined to a few coastal cities (such as\u00a0Septum (Ceuta)\u00a0in\u00a0Mauretania Tingitana\u00a0and\u00a0Cherchell\u00a0in\u00a0Mauretania Caesariensis) by the late 3rd century.\nEarly Islamic era.\nThe\u00a0Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, that started in the middle of the 7th century, was\u00a0achieved\u00a0early into the following century. It brought both the Arabic language and\u00a0Islam\u00a0to the area. Although part of the larger\u00a0Islamic Empire, Morocco was initially organized as a subsidiary province of\u00a0Ifriqiya, with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in\u00a0Kairouan.\nThe indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their\u00a0customary laws. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration.\u00a0The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the\u00a0Kingdom of Nekor, an emirate in the\u00a0Rif Mountains. It was founded by\u00a0Salih I ibn Mansur\u00a0in 710, as a client state to the\u00a0Rashidun Caliphate. After the outbreak of the\u00a0Berber Revolt\u00a0in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the\u00a0Miknasa\u00a0of\u00a0Sijilmasa\u00a0and the\u00a0Barghawata.\nAccording to medieval legend,\u00a0Idris ibn Abdallah\u00a0had fled to Morocco after the Abbasids massacre of his tribe in Iraq. He convinced the\u00a0Awraba\u00a0Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs in\u00a0Baghdad\u00a0and he founded the\u00a0Idrisid dynasty\u00a0in 788. The Idrisids established\u00a0Fes\u00a0as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major\u00a0regional power. The Idrissids were ousted in 927 by the\u00a0Fatimid Caliphate\u00a0and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the\u00a0Maghrawa\u00a0of Sijilmasa in 980.\nBerber dynasties.\nThe\u00a0Almohad\u00a0realm at its greatest extent, c. 1212\nFrom the 11th century onwards, a series of powerful Berber\u00a0dynasties arose. Under the\u00a0Almoravid dynasty\u00a0\u00a0and the\u00a0Almohad dynasty, Morocco dominated the Maghreb, much of present-day Spain and Portugal, and the western Mediterranean region. From the 13th century onwards the country saw a massive migration of\u00a0Banu Hilal\u00a0Arab tribes. In the 13th and 14th centuries the\u00a0Merinids\u00a0held power in Morocco and strove to replicate the successes of the\u00a0Almohads\u00a0by military campaigns in Algeria and Spain. They were followed by the\u00a0Wattasids. In the 15th century, the\u00a0Reconquista\u00a0ended Muslim rule in central and southern\u00a0Spain\u00a0and many\u00a0Muslims\u00a0and\u00a0Jews\u00a0fled to Morocco.\nPortuguese\u00a0efforts to control the Atlantic sea trade in the 15th century did not greatly affect the interior of Morocco even though they managed to control some possessions on the Moroccan coast but not venturing further afield inland.\nOn another note and according to Elizabeth Allo Isichei, \"In 1520, there was a\u00a0famine\u00a0in Morocco so terrible that for a long time other events were dated by it. It has been suggested that the population of Morocco fell from 5 to under 3\u00a0million between the early sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.\"\nMorocco, Safi ceramic vessel Jobbana\nSharifian dynasties.\nFormer Portuguese\u00a0fortress of Mazagan\u00a0in\u00a0El Jadida\nIn 1549, the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the\u00a0Islamic prophet,\u00a0Muhammad: first the\u00a0Saadi dynasty\u00a0who ruled from 1549 to 1659, and then the\u00a0Alaouite Dynasty, who remained in power since the 17th century.\nUnder the Saadi Dynasty, the country repulsed\u00a0Ottomanincursions and a\u00a0Portuguese\u00a0invasion at the\u00a0battle of Ksar el Kebir\u00a0in 1578. The reign of\u00a0Ahmad al-Mansur\u00a0brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a large expedition to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the\u00a0Songhay Empirein 1591. However, managing the territories across the\u00a0Sahara\u00a0proved too difficult. After the death of al-Mansur, the country was divided among his sons.\nIn 1666, Morocco was reunited by the\u00a0Alaouite Dynasty, who have been the ruling house of Morocco ever since. Morocco was facing aggression from\u00a0Spain\u00a0and the Ottoman Empire allies pressing westward. The Alaouites succeeded in stabilising their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy. Against the opposition of local tribes\u00a0Ismail Ibn Sharif\u00a0(1672\u20131727) began to create a unified state.With his Jaysh d'Ahl al-Rif (the\u00a0Riffian\u00a0Army) he seized\u00a0Tangier\u00a0from the\u00a0English\u00a0in 1684 and drove the\u00a0Spanish\u00a0from\u00a0Larache\u00a0in 1689.\nMorocco was the first nation to recognise the fledgling United States as an independent nation in 1777.\u00a0In the beginning of the\u00a0American Revolution, American merchant ships in the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean\u00a0were subject to attack by the\u00a0Barbary pirates. On December 20 1777, Morocco's Sultan\u00a0Mohammed III\u00a0declared that American merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage. The\u00a0Moroccan\u2013American Treaty of Friendship, signed in 1786, stands as the U.S's oldest non-broken friendship\u00a0treaty.\nFrench and Spanish protectorates.\nDeath of\u00a0Spanish\u00a0general\u00a0Margalloduring the\u00a0Melilla War.\u00a0Le Petit Journal, November 13 1893.\nMain articles:\u00a0French Morocco\u00a0and\u00a0Spanish Protectorate in Morocco\nAs Europe industrialised, North Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830, not only to protect the border of its Algerian territory, but also because of the strategic position of Morocco on two oceans.\u00a0In 1860, a dispute over Spain's Ceuta enclave led Spain to declare war. Victorious Spain won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement. In 1884, Spain created a protectorate in the coastal areas of Morocco.\nIn 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0of France's\u00a0sphere of influence\u00a0provoked a strong reaction from the\u00a0German Empire; and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the\u00a0Algeciras Conference\u00a0in 1906. The\u00a0Agadir Crisis\u00a0of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912\u00a0Treaty of Fezmade Morocco a\u00a0protectorate\u00a0of France, and triggered the\u00a01912 Fez riots.\u00a0Spain continued to operate its coastal protectorate. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of\u00a0protecting power\u00a0over the northern and southern\u00a0Saharan\u00a0zones.\nTens of thousands of colonists entered Morocco. Some bought up large amounts of the rich agricultural land, others organised the exploitation and modernisation of mines and harbours. Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured France to increase its control over Morocco a control which was also made necessary by the continuous wars among Moroccan tribes, part of which had taken sides with the French since the beginning of the conquest. Governor general, Marshall\u00a0Hubert Lyautey, sincerely admired Moroccan culture and succeeded in imposing a joint Moroccan-French administration, while creating a modern school system. Several divisions of Moroccan soldiers (Goumiers\u00a0or regular troops and officers) served in the\u00a0French army\u00a0in both\u00a0World War I\u00a0and\u00a0World War II, and in the Spanish\u00a0Nationalist Army\u00a0in the\u00a0Spanish Civil War\u00a0and after (\"Regulares\").\u00a0The institution of\u00a0slavery\u00a0was abolished in 1925.\nTangier's population included 40,000 Muslims, 31,000 Europeans and 15,000 Jews.\nBetween 1921 and 1926, a\u00a0Berber uprising\u00a0in the Rif Mountains, led by\u00a0Abd el-Krim, led to the establishment of the Republic of the Rif. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by French and Spanish troops.\nIn 1943, the\u00a0Istiqlal Party\u00a0(Independence Party) was founded to press for independence, with discreet US support. That party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement.\nFrance's exile of\u00a0Sultan Mohammed V\u00a0in 1953 to\u00a0Madagascar\u00a0and his replacement by the unpopular\u00a0Mohammed Ben Aarafa\u00a0sparked active opposition to the French and Spanish protectorates. The most notable violence occurred in\u00a0Oujda\u00a0where Moroccans attacked French and other European residents in the streets. France allowed Mohammed V to return in 1955, and the negotiations that led to Moroccan independence began the following year.\u00a0In March 1956 the French protectorate was ended and Morocco regained its independence from France as the \"Kingdom of Morocco\". A month later Spain ceded most of its protectorate in Northern Morocco to the new state but kept its two coastal enclaves (Ceuta\u00a0and\u00a0Melilla) on the Mediterranean coast. Sultan Mohammed became king in 1957.\nPost-independence.\nThe\u00a0Mausoleum of Mohammed V\u00a0in Rabat.\nUpon the death of Mohammed V,\u00a0Hassan II\u00a0became King of Morocco on 3 March 1961. Morocco held its first\u00a0general elections in 1963. However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971, there was a failed attempt to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.\nThe Spanish\u00a0enclave\u00a0of\u00a0Ifni\u00a0in the south was returned to Morocco in 1969. The\u00a0Polisario movement\u00a0was formed in 1973, with the aim of establishing an independent state in the Spanish Sahara. On 6 November 1975 King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the Spanish Sahara. Some 350,000 civilians were reported as being involved in the \"Green March\".\u00a0A month later, Spain agreed to leave the Spanish Sahara, soon to become Western Sahara, and to transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian control, despite the objections and threats of military intervention by Algeria. Moroccan forces occupied the territory.\nMoroccan and Algerian troops soon clashed in Western Sahara. Morocco and Mauritania divided up Western Sahara. Fighting between the Moroccan military and Polisario forces continued for many years. The prolonged war was a considerable financial drain on Morocco. In 1983, Hassan cancelled planned elections amid political unrest and economic crisis. In 1984, Morocco left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the\u00a0SADR's admission to the body. Polisario claimed to have killed more than 5,000 Moroccan soldiers between 1982 and 1985.\nAlgerian authorities have estimated the number of\u00a0Sahrawi refugees\u00a0in Algeria to be 165,000.\u00a0Diplomatic relations with Algeria were restored in 1988. In 1991, a UN-monitored ceasefire began in Western Sahara, but the territory's status remains undecided and ceasefire violations are reported. The following decade saw much wrangling over a proposed referendum on the future of the territory but the deadlock was not broken.\nPolitical reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997 and Morocco's first opposition-led government came to power in 1998.\nProtestors in\u00a0Casablanca\u00a0demand that authorities honor their promises of political reform.\nKing Hassan II died in 1999 and was succeeded by his son,\u00a0Mohammed VI. He is a cautious moderniser who has introduced some economic and social liberalisation.\nMohammed VI paid a controversial visit to the Western Sahara in 2002. Morocco unveiled an autonomy blueprint for Western Sahara to the United Nations in 2007. The Polisario rejected the plan and put forward its own proposal. Morocco and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York but failed to come to any agreement. In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital\u00a0El Aai\u00fan.\nIn 2002, Morocco and Spain agreed to a US-brokered resolution over the disputed island of Perejil. Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag. There were renewed tensions in 2005 as hundreds of African migrants tried to storm the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. Morocco deported hundreds of the illegal migrants. In 2006 the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year, Spanish King\u00a0Juan Carlos I\u00a0visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves.\nDuring the\u00a02011\u201312 Moroccan protests, thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a referendum on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the\u00a0Arab Spring\u00a0protests. Despite the reforms made by Mohamed VI demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012. Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms.\nPolitics.\nMorocco is a constitutional monarchy. The political powers are shared between the king Muhammad VI (the sixth) and the Head of the Government. The King is the head of state (Person in charge of the country) and the most important person.\nThe people of Morocco vote for Members of Parliament to speak for them and to help make laws for them. The Council of Ministers defines what must be done. He makes all the important decisions. Today, the Head of Government is Abdelilah Benkirane.\nLegislative Branch\nSince the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers. The\u00a0Assembly of Representatives of Morocco\u00a0(\"Majlis an-Nuww\u00e2b/Assembl\u00e9e des R\u00e9presentants\") has 325 members elected for a five-year term, 295 elected in multi-seat\u00a0constituencies\u00a0and 30 in national lists consisting only of women. The\u00a0Assembly of Councillors (\"Majlis al-Mustasharin\") has 270 members, elected for a nine-year term, elected by local councils (162 seats), professional chambers (91 seats) and wage-earners (27 seats).\nThe Parliament's powers, though still relatively limited, were expanded under the 1992 and 1996 and even further in the 2011 constitutional revisions and include\u00a0budgetary\u00a0matters, approving\u00a0bills, questioning ministers, and establishing ad hoc commissions of inquiry to investigate the government's actions. The lower chamber of Parliament may dissolve the government through a\u00a0vote of no confidence.\nThe latest parliamentary elections were held on\u00a0November 25, 2011, and were considered by some neutral observers to be mostly free and fair. Voter turnout in these elections was estimated to be 43% of registered voters.\nGeography.\nMorocco is next to the countries of Algeria to its east and Mauritania to its south. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the north of Morocco, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.\nMorocco has a diverse geography from fertile plains, to forests, cold mountains, dry lands, and deserts. Most people live in areas close to the coast, or in fertile farms. Morocco has an area of 446,550\u00a0km\u00b2. Morocco also controls most of the Western Sahara which is 266.000\u00a0km\u00b2 big.Morocco has a coast by the\u00a0Atlantic Ocean\u00a0that reaches past the\u00a0Strait of Gibraltar\u00a0into the\u00a0Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by\u00a0Spain\u00a0to the north (a water border through the Strait and land borders with three small Spanish-controlled\u00a0exclaves,\u00a0Ceuta,\u00a0Melilla, and\u00a0Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera),\u00a0Algeria\u00a0to the east, and\u00a0Mauritania\u00a0to the south. Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its\u00a0\"de facto\"\u00a0southern boundary is with\u00a0Mauritania.\nThe internationally recognised borders of the country lie between latitudes\u00a027\u00b0\u00a0and 36\u00b0N, and longitudes 1\u00b0 and\u00a014\u00b0W. Adding the Moroccan Sahara, Morocco lies mostly between\u00a021\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a036\u00b0N, and\u00a01\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a017\u00b0W\u00a0(the\u00a0Ras Nouadhibou\u00a0peninsula is slightly south of 21\u00b0 and west of 17\u00b0).\nThe geography of Morocco spans from the Atlantic Ocean, to mountainous areas, to the Sahara desert. Morocco is a\u00a0Northern African\u00a0country, bordering the\u00a0North Atlantic Ocean\u00a0and the Mediterranean Sea, between Algeria and Mauritania. It is one of only three nations (along with\u00a0Spain\u00a0and\u00a0France) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.\nA large part of Morocco is mountainous. The\u00a0Atlas Mountains\u00a0are located mainly in the centre and the south of the country. The\u00a0Rif Mountains\u00a0are in the north of the country. Both ranges are mainly inhabited by the\u00a0Berber people. At 446,550\u00a0km2(172,414\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Morocco is the fifty-seventh largest country in the world (after\u00a0Uzbekistan). Algeria borders Morocco to the east and southeast, though the border between the two countries has been closed since 1994.\nSpanish territory in North Africa neighbouring Morocco comprises five enclaves on the Mediterranean coast:\u00a0Ceuta,\u00a0Melilla,\u00a0Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera,\u00a0Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Alhucemas, the\u00a0Chafarinas\u00a0islands, and the disputed islet\u00a0Perejil. Off the Atlantic coast the\u00a0Canary Islands\u00a0belong to Spain, whereas\u00a0Madeira\u00a0to the north is\u00a0Portuguese. To the north, Morocco is bordered by the Strait of Gibraltar, where international shipping has unimpeded\u00a0transit passage\u00a0between the Atlantic and Mediterranean.\nThe Rif mountains stretch over the region bordering the Mediterranean from the north-west to the north-east. The Atlas Mountains run down the backbone of the country, from the northeast to the south west. Most of the southeast portion of the country is in the\u00a0Sahara Desert\u00a0and as such is generally sparsely populated and unproductive economically. Most of the population lives to the north of these mountains, while to the south lies the Moroccan Sahara, a former Spanish colony that was liberated by Morocco in 1975 (see\u00a0Green March).\u00a0Morocco claims that the Moroccan Sahara is part of its territory and refers to that as its\u00a0Southern Provinces.\nMorocco's capital city is\u00a0Rabat; its largest city is its main port,\u00a0Casablanca. Other cities include\u00a0Agadir,\u00a0Essaouira,\u00a0Fes,\u00a0Marrakesh,\u00a0Meknes,\u00a0Mohammedia,\u00a0Oujda,\u00a0Ouarzazat,\u00a0Safi,\u00a0Sal\u00e9,\u00a0Tangier\u00a0and\u00a0T\u00e9touan.[Br.-Bl. \u201cVegetatio.\u201d\u00a0\"Vegetatio\", vol. 11, no. 5/6, 1963, pp.\u00a0405\u2013405., www.jstor.org/stable/20034938.]\nClimate.\nK\u00f6ppen climate types in Morocco\nThe country's\u00a0Mediterranean\u00a0climate is similar to that of southern\u00a0California, with lush forests in the northern and central mountain ranges of the country, giving way to dryer conditions and inland deserts further southeast. The Moroccan coastal plains experience remarkably moderate temperatures even in summer, owing to the effect of the cold\u00a0Canary Current\u00a0off its\u00a0Atlantic\u00a0coast.\nIn the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree\u00a0endemicto Morocco. In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.\nSoutheast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The southeastern-most portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the\u00a0Sahara Desert, where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush\u00a0oases.\nIn contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal\u00a0plains\u00a0are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which 95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes from Morocco a country of contrasts.\u00a0Forested areas\u00a0cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%. Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.\nLandscape of the\u00a0Erg Chebbi\nAtlas Mountains\nIn general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus we have the following climate zones:\n\"Oceanic:\"\u00a0Determined by the cooler summers, where highs rarely go above 27\u00a0\u00b0C (80.6\u00a0\u00b0F) and in terms of Essaouira region are almost always around 21\u00a0\u00b0C (69.8\u00a0\u00b0F). The medium daily temperatures can get as low as 19\u00a0\u00b0C (66.2\u00a0\u00b0F), while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies from 400 to 700\u00a0mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are\u00a0Rabat,\u00a0Casablanca,\u00a0K\u00e9nitra,\u00a0Sal\u00e9\u00a0and\u00a0Essaouira.\n\"Continental:\"\u00a0Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104.0\u00a0\u00b0F) during heat waves, but usually are between 32\u00a0\u00b0C (89.6\u00a0\u00b0F) and 36\u00a0\u00b0C (96.8\u00a0\u00b0F). However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68.0\u00a0\u00b0F), and sometimes as low as 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50.0\u00a0\u00b0F) in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also snow can fall occasionally. F\u00e8s for example registered 8\u00a0\u00b0C (17.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and 900\u00a0mm. Notable cities are\u00a0F\u00e8s,\u00a0Mekn\u00e8s,\u00a0Chefchaouen,\u00a0Beni-Mellal\u00a0and\u00a0Taza.\nSouth of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.\nNote:\u00a0Due to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when\u00a0sirocco\u00a0blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena don't last for more than 2 to 5 days on average.\nCountries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are\u00a0California(USA),\u00a0Portugal,\u00a0Spain\u00a0and\u00a0Algeria.\nAnnual rainfall in Morocco is different according to regions. The northwestern parts of the country receive between 500\u00a0mm and 1200\u00a0mm, while the northeastern parts receive between 350 and 600\u00a0mm. North Central Morocco receives between 700\u00a0mm and up to 3500\u00a0mm. The area from Casablanca to Essaouira, on the Atlantic coast, receives between 300\u00a0mm and 500\u00a0mm. The regions from Essaouira to Agadir receive between 250\u00a0mm and 400\u00a0mm. Marrakesh region in the central south receives only 250\u00a0mm a year. The southeastern regions, basically the driest areas, receive between 100\u00a0mm and 200\u00a0mm only, and consist basically of arid and desert lands.\nBotanically speaking, Morocco enjoys a great variety of vegetation, from lush large forests of conifer and oak trees typical of the western Mediterranean countries (Morocco, Algeria, Italy, Spain, France and Portugal), to shrubs and acacias further south. This is due to the diversity of climate and the precipitation patterns in the country.\nMorocco's weather is one of the most pristine in terms of the four-season experience. Most regions have distinct seasons where summer is usually not spoiled by rain and winter turns wet, snowy and humid with mild, cool to cold temperatures, while spring and fall see warm to mild weather characterised by flowers blooming in spring and falling leaves in autumn. This type of weather has affected the Moroccan culture and behaviour and played a part in the social interaction of the population, like many other countries that fall into this type of climate zone.presented in the\u00a0ISO 3166-1 alpha-2\u00a0geographical encoding standard by the symbol\u00a0\"MA\".\u00a0This code was used as the basis for Morocco's internet domain,\u00a0ma.\nThe capital of Morocco is Rabat. About 1.2 million people live in Rabat. The biggest city in Morocco is however Casablanca, with nearly 4 million people living there. Both Rabat and Casablanca have large ports and industrial zones. The third biggest city is Marrakesh from which the word \"Morocco\" is made.

People from Morocco are called Moroccans. Moroccans are Arab, indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African and European.\nThe official languages of Morocco are Arabic and Berber. French is also very used in companies, universities, and in some TV channels. Morocco was part of the French colonial empire for 44 years. Some people in the north (close to Spain) speak Spanish as well. Spain also occupied parts of Morocco before leaving them in 1956 and in 1975.\nMost educated Moroccans do not speak English well, or do not know it at all. In the 21st century English is being taught to students in an increasing number of schools.\nMost Moroccans follow Islam as their religion. There are very small numbers of Christians, Jews, and non-believers. Morocco is home to the oldest university in the world, the University of Karaouine.\nMilitary.\nMohammed VI, a\u00a0FREMM multipurpose frigate\u00a0of the\u00a0Royal Moroccan Navy.\nCompulsory military service in Morocco has been officially suspended since September 2006, and Morocco's reserve obligation lasts until age 50. Morocco's military consists of the Royal Armed Forces this includes the\u00a0Army\u00a0(the largest branch), the\u00a0Navy, the\u00a0Air Force, the\u00a0Royal Guard, the\u00a0Royal Gendarmerie\u00a0and the\u00a0Auxiliary Forces. Internal security is generally effective, and acts of political violence are rare (with one exception, the\u00a02003 Casablanca bombings\u00a0which killed 45 people).\nThe UN maintains a small observer force in Western Sahara, where a large number of Morocco's troops are stationed. The Saharawi group\u00a0Polisario\u00a0maintains an active militia of an estimated 5,000 fighters in Western Sahara and has engaged in intermittent warfare with Moroccan forces since the 1970s.\nForeign relations.\nMorocco is a member of the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0and belongs to the\u00a0Arab League,\u00a0Arab Maghreb Union\u00a0(UMA),\u00a0Organisation of Islamic Cooperation\u00a0(OIC), the\u00a0Non-Aligned Movement\u00a0and the\u00a0Community of Sahel-Saharan States\u00a0(CEN_SAD). Morocco's relationships vary greatly between African, Arab, and Western states. Morocco has had strong ties to the West in order to gain economic and political benefits.\u00a0France and Spain remain the primary trade partners, as well as the primary creditors and foreign investors in Morocco. From the total foreign investments in Morocco, the\u00a0European Union\u00a0invests approximately 73.5%, whereas, the Arab world invests only 19.3%. Many countries from the\u00a0Persian Gulf\u00a0and\u00a0Maghreb regions are getting more involved in large-scale development projects in Morocco.\nMorocco claims sovereignty over Spanish enclaves of\u00a0Ceuta\u00a0and\u00a0Melilla.\nMorocco was the only African state not to be a member of the\u00a0African Union\u00a0due to its unilateral withdrawal on November 12 1984 over the admission of the\u00a0Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\u00a0in 1982 by the\u00a0African Union\u00a0(then called Organisation of African Unity) as a full member without the organisation of a referendum of self-determination in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Morocco rejoined the AU on January 30 2017.\nA\u00a0dispute with Spain in 2002 over the tiny island of Perejil\u00a0revived the issue of the sovereignty of\u00a0Melilla\u00a0and\u00a0Ceuta. These small enclaves on the Mediterranean coast are surrounded by Morocco and have been administered by Spain for centuries.\nMorocco has been given the status of\u00a0major non-NATO ally\u00a0by the US government. Morocco was the first country in the world to recognise US sovereignty (in 1777).\nMorocco is included in the European Union's\u00a0European Neighbourhood Policy\u00a0(ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.\nWestern Sahara status.\nMorocco liberated the Moroccan Sahara in 1975. The\u00a0Polisario Front\u00a0control the territory east of the\u00a0Moroccan\u00a0\"berm\"(wall).\nDue to the conflict over\u00a0Western Sahara, the status of the\u00a0Saguia el-Hamra\u00a0and\u00a0Dakhla Oued Dahab\u00a0regions is disputed. The\u00a0Western Sahara War\u00a0saw the\u00a0Polisario Front, the Sahrawi rebel national liberation movement, battling both Morocco and Mauritania between 1976 and a ceasefire in 1991 that was broken in 2020. A United Nations mission,\u00a0MINURSO, is tasked with organizing a referendum on whether the territory should become independent or recognised as a part of Morocco.\nPart of the territory, the\u00a0Free Zone, is a mostly uninhabited area that the Polisario Front controls as the\u00a0Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Its administrative headquarters are in\u00a0Tindouf, Algeria. As of 2006, no\u00a0UN member state\u00a0has recognised Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara.\nIn 2006, the government of Morocco has suggested\u00a0autonomous\u00a0status for the region, through the Moroccan\u00a0Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs\u00a0(CORCAS). The project was presented to the\u00a0United Nations Security Council in mid-April 2007. The proposal was encouraged by Moroccan allies such as the\u00a0United States,\u00a0France\u00a0and\u00a0Spain.\u00a0The Security Council has called upon the parties to enter into direct and unconditional negotiations to reach a mutually accepted political solution.\nDivisions.\nMorocco is divided into 12 regions. The regions are divided into 62 prefectures and provinces.\nAs of 2014 the regions are:\nProvinces.\nMorocco is divided into 37 provinces and 2 wilayas : Agadir, Al Hoceima, Azilal, Beni Mellal, Benslimane, Boulemane, Casablanca, Chefchaouen, El Jadida, El Kelaa of Sraghna, Errachidia, Essaouira, Fez, Figuig, Guelmim, Ifrane, Kenitra, Khemisset, Rommani, Khenifra, Khouribga, Laayoune, Larache, Marrakech, Meknes, Nador, Ouarzazate, Oujda, Rabat, Sale, Settat, Safi, Sidi Kacem, Tangier, Tan-Tan, Taounate, Taroudant, Tata, Taza, Tetouan, Tiznit. Three additional provinces of Dakhla (Oued ed Dahab), Boujdour, and Es-Smara as well as parts of Tan-Tan and Laayoune fall within Moroccan-claimed Western Sahara.\nEconomy.\nMining, agriculture, fishing, and tourism are the 4 main parts of Morocco's national economy. Also, Moroccans working in Europe (about 2 million) send billions of Euros of money home to their families every year.\nTourism is becoming very important too. Many Americans and Europens come to see the historical places of Morocco, live the Berber countryside life, or enjoy the warm sun and the long and clean beaches. Marrakesh is the most liked city by tourists.\nThe currency of Morocco is called the Dirham, its code is MAD."}

He was the 17th president of the United States from 1865 to 1869. Before becoming president, he was the 16th vice president. He became president after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. He was the first president to be impeached, but he was not removed from office. The impeachment happened because he fired the Secretary of War after Congress had made it illegal. This was also considered strange, as it is usually up to the president to appoint and fire his secretaries. However, Congress disliked him because he was a Democrat and did not want to help former slaves.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1808, in a house with one room. His family was very poor and he never went to school. He was apprenticed as a tailor and held by a tailor named Selby as an indentured servant, a sort of slave. The contract stated Johnson should work for Selby until he was 21, but Johnson did not like the work and ran away with his brother. The tailor put out wanted posters but Johnson never returned. In the end he started a business of his own in Greeneville in Tennessee, where he met and married Eliza McCardle. She was very ill because of tuberculosis, a sickness of the lung, but Johnson loved her very much. She taught him to read properly and helped him study, which helped him enter politics. He became mayor of Greeneville in 1834, aged 25. In 1843, he was elected to the House of Representatives in Washington D.C. In 1853, he became Governor of Tennessee, the most powerful position in the state. After serving two terms, he was instead elected Senator (in this time, the Tennessee General Assembly elected both these positions, not the people) and returned to Washington D.C. Johnson was very wealthy then and owned several slaves himself. It was a time when the country was at a breaking point because of slavery and other conditions. \nPolitical career.\nWhen Tennessee and ten other Southern slave states declared they were no longer part of the United States, he was the only member from among them to not quit his seat. Instead, he went to the U.S. and helped the North in the war, a so-called \"Union Democrat\". Despite being a Democrat, he was elected as Abraham Lincoln's Vice President on a \"National Union\" ticket in 1864, which thought the war should be ended and the south welcomed back into the union. Lincoln chose Johnson because he had been loyal but also thought it would be good to have a Democrat on the election ticket to show it was not a matter of party politics. Johnson freed his slaves in 1863, shortly before the law made it illegal. In 1865, Congress banned slavery in the entire U.S. just before the war ended. \nPresidency (1865\u20131869).\nHe became president in 1865 after Abraham Lincoln was killed. Congress was then run by Republicans, and after Lincoln's assassination, they wanted stricter terms than Johnson did for the Reconstruction of the Southern states that had rebelled. Congress was also more friendlier to African Americans who had recently been slaves, and many Republicans wanted them to vote and be given land. Johnson, who was a Democrat, thought it would hurt white people in the South and was strongly opposed to these policies. As a result, he vetoed 29 bills passed by Congress, and is the president to have the most vetoes overridden. This can happen if Congress passes the law a second time with a 2/3-majority, meaning twice as many people supports the law as opposes it. If this happens the veto fails and the law passes anyway. It is very unusual but happened 15 times to Johnson, which is a record.\nHe was also the first President to be impeached in 1868, but was later acquitted in the Senate. When a president is removed by Congress, the House of Representatives must vote to impeach him, and then the Senate to convict, by a 2/3-majority. Although the Republicans had that many senators, the conviction failed by one vote. Several Republicans thought it was not their job to replace the president, and that the charges against Johnson were made up. So Johnson could keep his job for the last year. There would be another 130 years before another president was impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998. Johnson was the only U.S. president never to have gone to school, and was taught to read by himself and by his wife, Eliza McCardle Johnson. He also taught himself law and politics by reading himself. The U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million (the price was 2 cents per acre) while he was president, but it was Secretary of State William Seward who arranged the buy. It is now considered a very wise move and the natural resources in Alaska today are worth many billions.\nAfter his term ran out, Johnson left Washington. In 1875, he returned after being again elected senator for Tennessee. He died the same year. He remains the only president of the U.S. to have served as a senator after being president. One former president, John Quincy Adams, has served in the House of Representatives after his presidency, however."}

{"id": "15297", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15297", "title": "Starfish", "text": "Starfish, or sea stars, are Echinoderms of the Class Asteroidea.p35\nAll live in the ocean, on the sea floor. Many starfish live in deep water, others in shallow water. Some live in the intertidal zone, between low and high tide. They have five or more arms and can be quite large. The Sunflower sea star (\"Pycnopodia helianthoides\") is the largest: fully grown, its arm-span is about a metre. This is a bit larger than the famous Crown-of-thorns starfish, which lives on coral polyps.\nAlthough starfish are invertebrates, they do have a kind of skeleton. The bodies of starfish are composed of calcium carbonate plates, known as 'ossicles'. These form the endoskeleton, which takes on a variety of forms such as spines and granules.\nThey have a primitive nervous system, but not a brain. They also do not have blood, instead they use sea water to pump things around their bodies.\nThere are over 1500 different species of sea star. Most sea stars are predators. They eat mussels, clams, and other bivalves. Occasionally, they catch small fish.\nSymmetry.\nMost starfish have five arms, called \"rays\" that come out from a center circle (disk). If a starfish has more than five rays, it will often have rays in multiples of five; there could be 10, 15, 20, or even 30 rays on one starfish. This is called pentameral (five-fold) symmetry.\nSkeleton.\nThe degree of protection offered by the skeleton differs between species. If the skeleton becomes more rigid, it offers better protection against predators. However, this will tend to limit its feeding alternatives. Great flexibility is required for the process of external digestion used by many species to eat bivalves. The less well armoured species may adopt a life in places where they are not so open to predation. The heavily armoured ones can tough it out in the most competitive habitats:\nFeeding.\nSenses.\nThe movement of starfish is guided by their senses of touch and sight. There are five 'eyes', light-sensitive cushions, one at the end of each arm. These and the tube feet are connected to nerve fibres, so these animals are more complex than might appear.\nTube feet.\nAlthough starfish started off as filter-feeders, they evolved to become major predators of shell-fish (the brachiopods and bivalves). They can also eat small crustacea and fish. Their tube feet developed suckers, perhaps originally to improve movement. Later, they were used to open shell-fish.\nFeeding methods.\nThe shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and hydraulic system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit. Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell. The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm. The starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives, absorbing the nutrients. This digestion process takes much longer than opening the shell, perhaps a couple of days.\nSome species swallow the shell whole, and dissolve the contents inside their stomach, then push out the shell afterwards.p45\nThe ability of starfish to eat brachipods and bivalves developed in the Mesozoic, especially in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. This was part of the \"Mesozoic marine revolution\", which transformed the sea-floor fauna. Weakly defended and static shellfish disappeared, and more heavily armoured or more mobile shellfish flourished.\nRegeneration.\nStarfish, like many sea creatures, are able to \"regenerate\" (grow back) parts of their bodies. Starfish are better at regeneration than most other creatures. Not only can a new ray grow when a ray is torn off, but if the torn off ray has even a small piece of the central disk still attached, a whole new starfish can grow from the one ray.p35\nBecause starfish like to eat clams and oysters, fishermen who gather shellfish have tried for years to get rid of them. To kill the starfish, fishermen would catch them, slice them right in half, and throw them back in the ocean. However, because starfish can grow back parts of their bodies, they were actually increasing the number of starfish."}

They are a monophyletic clade, the Medusozoa. Most of them live in the oceans, in salt water, where they eat small sea animals like plankton and little fish, and float in the sea. Only a few jellyfish live in fresh water. \nThey have soft bodies and long, stinging, venomous tentacles that they use to catch their prey, usually small plankton animals or small crustaceans or tiny fish. Some jellyfish hunt others by stinging cells called \"nematocysts\". A jellyfish is 97% water.\nMost jellyfish have a bell-shaped body and long tentacles at the underside of the body. Tentacles are long \"arms\" with special stinging cells called nematocysts. They move by contracting their bodies, but they do not have much control over where they go: most of the time, they drift with the water current. The largest type of jellyfish is the Lion's mane jellyfish, which has tentacles that can be as long as 60 meters, but most jellyfish are much smaller.\nThe Medusozoa are four classes of the Cnidaria: \nThere are many types of jellyfish. The smallest jellyfish are just a few centimetres across. The largest jellyfish is the Lion's mane (\"Cyanea capillata\"), whose body can be over 3 feet (1 m) across, with much longer tentacles. Some jellyfish glow in the dark (this is called phosphorescence). Some of the most dangerous jelly fish include the box jelly (Genuses \"Chironex\", \"Chiropsalmus\" and \"Carybdea\") and the tiny, two-cm-across Irukandji jelly (\"Carukia barnesi\"); the venomous sting of these jellyfish can kill a person.\nMany animals eat jellyfish, including sea turtles and some fish (including the sun fish). Humans eat jellyfish too; especially in Asia jellyfish are considered a delicacy. Jellyfish spoil very quickly after they are caught. Sometimes they are dried to preserve them. There is a different process in which they are cleaned, which can take up to 40 days. They are often eaten in a kind of salad, with soy sauce or vinegar.\nLife cycle.\nMost jellyfish undergo two distinct life history stages (body forms) during their life cycle. The first is the polypoid stage, when the animal takes the form of a small stalk with feeding tentacles. Very often, this polyp is attached to the sea floor, or to another hard surface; it rarely moves around. A polyp that lives that way is called sessile. In some cases, the polyp is free-floating. Polyps generally have a mouth surrounded by upward-facing tentacles. Polyps may be on their own or in groups, and some bud asexually, making more polyps. Most are very small, measured in millimeters.\nIn the second stage, the tiny polyps asexually produce jellyfish, each of which is known as a medusa. Tiny jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed in the plankton. Jellyfish reproduce both sexually and asexually. Well-fed adult jellyfish spawn daily. In most species, spawning is controlled by light, so the entire population spawns at about the same time of day, often at either dusk or dawn. Jellyfish are usually either male or female (with occasional hermaphrodites). In most cases, adults release sperm and eggs into the surrounding water, where the (unprotected) eggs are fertilized and mature into new organisms.\nMedusae have a radially symmetric, umbrella-shaped body called a bell, which is usually supplied with marginal tentacles that capture prey. A few species of jellyfish do not have the polyp portion of the life cycle, but go from jellyfish to the next generation of jellyfish through direct development of fertilized eggs. Jellyfish at the medusa stage usually lives only up to six months, after which it dies.\nJellyfish eat plankton and small fish, which they catch using their venomous tentacles. Jellyfish may live in symbiosis with algae. The jellyfish transports them into sunlight and get nutrients from the algae's photosynthesis. Both forms of jelly fish have small tentacles with nematocysts (stinging cells) that sting and can hurt people on contact.\nOther facts.\nMedusozoans differ from anthozoans in having a medusa stage in their life cycle. Their mitochondrial DNA molecules are linear rather than circular as in anthozoans and almost all other animals. The cnidae, the explosive cells of the Cnidaria, are of a single type. There are nematocysts but no spirocysts or ptychocysts.\nA group of jellyfish is called a current; an occurrence of many jellyfish simultaneously is sometimes called a \"bloom\". "}

This allows the exchange of nutrients and metabolic waste. Collagen fibers in each ring of cells ('lamellae') give them structure.\nOsteons have a hole down the middle, called the haversian canal. This canal contains the bone's blood supply. It also contains capillaries, and nerve fibres.\nThe details of osteon structure varies between bones and parts of bones, from species to species, between sexes, and by age and environmental factors."}

It is also called white bear or northern bear. It has black skin under the white fur. They are strong and fast, and can run as fast as 25\u00a0miles (40\u00a0km) an hour for a short distance.\nIn 2021, there were around 26,000 polar bears in the world.\nAppearance.\nPolar bear fur is made up of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of \"guard hairs\", which appear white to tan but are actually translucent. The fur keeps them very warm. The skin is not white; it is black. Therefore, they can absorb sunlight efficiently. They are strong and can swim very well. Polar bears are similar in size to a normal bear but have a slimmer neck, longer legs and fur.\nLife.\nThey are mostly carnivorous. Polar bears are apex predators. They eat mostly seals and fish. They also eat sea lions, walruses, reindeer, arctic hares, penguins, seagulls, small whales, lemmings, crabs and carrion. When polar bears hunt, they often wait at holes in the ice, where the seals come up to breathe. They can live off of one seal for many days, but it will make them hungry if they do.\nPolar bears live alone.\nYoung Polar bears stay with their mothers for 1\u20132 years, and they become mature when they are 5\u20136 years old. People think polar bears can become 25\u201330 years old in nature, but in captivity (for example, in zoos), they can become up to 45 years old.\nPolar bears live in countries in the Arctic Circle, including these:\nPolar bear cubs.\nThe breeding time is 8 months. The babies are born six weeks after their mother mates. At birth, a baby cub weighs less than 2\u00a0pounds (0.9 kilograms).\nThe mother feeds the babies milk, which makes them grow fast, and after 10 weeks, the cubs weigh about 20 to 25\u00a0pounds (9.1 to 11.4 kilograms).\nYoung polar bears wrestle in the snow to build their strength and skills. They practice using their strong paws, and they show off their big, sharp teeth.\nMother polar bears will do anything to protect their young. They can kill a predator with just one swat of their powerful front paws. Scientists have even seen a mother polar bear stand up and leap at a helicopter to keep it away from her cubs.\nDuring the first year, the cubs begin to eat solid food but still nurse from their mother. They begin to learn to hunt and swim. But they cannot live on their own.\nBy the time they are two years old, the cubs have grown into large bears. They leave their mother and strike off into territory of their own. They hunt and live alone. But they play with other bears they meet.\nPolar bears are ready to mate when they are five or six years old. They are adults by this time and weigh 330 to 660\u00a0pounds (150 to 300 kilograms).\nPolar bear adults.\nBoth male and female polar bears live to be as much as 30 years old (in a zoo). Polar bears have 42 teeth.\nAs adults, male bears fight with each other over a female each male fluffs out his coat of fur to make himself look bigger. Then, he swaggers along, growling, to scare off his rival. Polar bear scientists call this \"the cowboy walk.\"\nThe polar bear eats seals, fish and fruits (berries).\nThey can be up to 250\u00a0cm long and 160\u00a0cm tall and weigh up to 600\u00a0kg.\nWhen two polar bears meet, they have a special way of greeting each other. They circle around each other for a while, grunting. Then they come closer and touch noses.\nHistory.\nThe polar bear was the most dangerous animal to hunt. It was also greatly respected for its strength and spirit. The bear's blubber, meat, and fur all help the Inuit survive. The Inuit gave thanks and respect in turn. After a hunt, they held a celebration that lasted for several days. Then, a polar bear dance was held. Finally, the bear's skull was set on an ice floe to release its spirit back into the Arctic.\nPaws.\nA polar bear's paws are perfect snowshoes for them. The bottoms are wide and covered with fur to help keep the bear from slipping. The sharp claws help grip the ice.\nA polar bear can crawl across ice too thin for a human to walk on. They spread out their legs and lay their bellies flat on the ice. Then they use their claws to slowly push themselves across the ice.\nMating.\nPolar bears mate in April or May. The cub is born in December, when the mother is hibernating. The cub stays in the den with the mother until March, then, they all come out. They eat immediately after hibernating. Sometimes, because of global warming, this is impossible and the cubs die before they have had a chance to live. The cub leaves its mother in 2\u20133 years.\nLiver.\nThe polar bear's liver contains a lot of vitamin A. Inuit people knew that eating the liver could cause sickness and death. Several groups of European polar explorers were seriously ill after eating livers. The symptoms included drowsiness, wanting to sleep, being irritable, headaches, and vomiting. After 24\u00a0hours, people's skin began to peel off."}

For example, Jerry Garcia was the lead singer and frontman for the Grateful Dead.\nQualities.\nA good singer will have to think of a lot of different things in a performance. Good vocal technique, a large vocal range, as well as \"feeling the song\" through emotional language and breathing, and also acting to provide a song with meaning. A good singer may be able to learn a song quickly, but it may take some time before they really feel it has become \"part of them\". A lead singer has to be a strong singer since other vocalists must sing accordingly.\nSingers can sing as a solo, or in a group or a choir. Choirs can include gospel music, church music and even pop songs where there are usually two groups of singers, soprano and alto. Sopranos have a higher range and altos have a lower range. Combining these two can create various harmonies which add textures to songs and make them more interesting to listen to.\nPeople may feel like singing for various reasons. They may want to share their feelings with other people. They may be feeling happy about something, or sad, or excited, frustrated or angry. Singing is an art in which mood is expressed through the voice."}

He is most notable for the resist of the Japanese invasion and unify China, which he ruled as the chairman of the Communist Party of China.\nName.\nMao Zedong is the Latin-alphabet version of Mao's name now used by most people. In the romanization common in his lifetime, it was spelled \"Mao Tse-tung\". \"Mao\" is his family name - in China, family names are placed first. Mao is also called Chairman Mao, because he was the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party.\nRuler.\nIn the 1950s, Mao Zedong had many plans for how China could move forward in technology very quickly and catch up with countries like the United Kingdom and United States. Mao was responsible for the Five Year Plan. The Second Five Year Plan included the Great Leap Forward, which was a disaster for the Chinese people. Poor farming practices led to significant crop failure, and cities did not make many of their daily items like clothes and machines. The famine that came as a result killed millions of people via starvation.\nA few years after Mao won the civil in China, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader in the Soviet Union. Before this, Joseph Stalin was the leader in the Soviet Union, Mao liked Stalin and respected the way he led, and China and the Soviet Union became allies with each other. Khrushchev thought Stalin was a criminal dictator, and led the country very differently. Mao and Khrushchev did not like each other, so the Soviet Union was no longer allies with China. China now had only a few allies like Albania, North Korea, Democratic Kampuchea, and Pakistan. This change of friends was called the Sino-Soviet split. \"Sino\" is another way to say \"Chinese\".\nDuring the 1970s, Mao became more friendly with the United States. In 1972, American president Richard Nixon visited the People's Republic of China and met Mao. Mao died in September 1976, and the Cultural Revolution also ended that year. Mao's supporters were imprisoned, and Deng Xiaoping, who followed Mao, revised Mao's policies so that Chinese people could have private ownership.\nLiu Shaoqi.\nMao Zedong was afraid that Liu Shaoqi would overthrow him, and take over the CCP. As in the result, Mao blamed Liu Shaoqi for being a capitalist, and placed him in jail. Liu Shaoqi died in prison from brutal treatment, hunger, and terrible conditions.\nLin Biao.\nAfter Liu had been removed from leadership, the defence minister Lin Biao was ranked second in the party and hoped to succeed Mao.\nIn 1971, Lin Biao and his wife died in a plane crash after trying to assassinate Mao and seize power for himself.\nMao's death.\nMao had been in poor health for several years and had declined visibly for at least six months prior to his death. There are unconfirmed reports that he possibly had ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. Mao's last public appearance was on 27 May 1976, where he met the visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto during the latter's one-day visit to Beijing.\nAt around 5:00 pm on 2 September 1976, Mao suffered a heart attack, far more severe than his previous two and affecting a much larger area of his heart. Three days later, on 5 September, Mao's condition was still critical. On the afternoon of 7 September, Mao's condition completely deteriorated. Mao's organs failed quickly and he fell into a coma shortly before noon where he was put on life support machines. He was taken off life support over 12 hours later, quarter to midnight and was pronounced dead at 12:08 am on 9 September 1976. \nHis body lay in state at the Great Hall of the People. There was a three-minute silence observed during this service. His body was later placed into the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, despite his wishes to be cremated and he had been one of the first high-ranking officials to sign the \"Proposal that all Central Leaders be Cremated after Death\" in November 1956.\nLegacy.\nMany Chinese mainlanders still believe Mao Zedong was a great leader, but they also knew that he did unwise and bad things. According to Deng Xiaoping, Mao was \"seven parts right and three parts wrong\" and his \"contributions are primary and his mistakes secondary.\" Supporters praise him for having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war. He is also praised for having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education. Some people think Mao Zedong made China lose its most important ally, or friend, the Soviet Union, in the Sino-Soviet Split. The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were two of the things that Mao did that many people disliked. Some historians think that tens of millions of people died because of Mao's bad ideas and neglect. Some people disliked Mao because he did not express support family planning, and this caused too many births, making too rapid population growth in too small places. Leaders of China after Mao had to pass a new law called the one child policy.\nMao Zedong also made several changes to the Chinese language, such as switching from the Wade Giles system of Romanization to Pinyin. For this reason, Nanking is now called Nanjing on modern maps. Taiwan still uses Wade Giles, so its capital is called Taipei instead of the pinyin Taibei. He also simplified the Chinese characters, in theory it would make them easier to read and write so that more people would be literate."}

(\"Opus Dei\" means \"Work of God\" in Latin.) Opus Dei says that the Catholic Church gave them a special job: to tell everyone that God wants them to be close to him. This means that everyone is called by God to become a saint.\nOpus Dei was started by St. , a Roman Catholic priest, in 1928. It was approved by Pope Pius XII in 1950. Now, Opus Dei has around 85,000 members in 80 different countries.\nIn 1982, Pope John Paul II decided to make Opus Dei into a personal prelature. Usually, in the Catholic Church, there are separate dioceses in different areas. Each area has its own bishop who is in charge of just that diocese. But because Opus Dei is a personal prelature, its bishopm called the Prelate, is not limited to any specific area. He is in charge of members of Opus Dei wherever they are, around the world. The prelate of Opus Dei is Monsignor Fernando Oc\u00e1riz Bra\u00f1a.\nBeginnings and goals.\nOpus Dei was started by a Roman Catholic priest, Josemaria Escriv\u00e1, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. He said that God showed him what to do. On that day he \"saw Opus Dei.\"\nEscriv\u00e1 said that the goals of Opus Dei are:\nOpus Dei gives classes, talks, and other help so that people can practice these teachings.\nBelief that Opus Dei is God's work.\nPope John Paul II has said that Escriv\u00e1 was led by God when he started Opus Dei.\nIn 2002, Pope Benedict XVI said that Opus Dei is God's work, not Escriv\u00e1's. He said that God just used Escriva as a tool to start his own work.\nWhat it teaches.\nEscriv\u00e1 and Opus Dei teach that a person can get close to God by doing these things:\nEscriv\u00e1 said that the basis of a Christian life is being a child of God. If people are aware of this, then they will always be very happy. He wrote that joy comes from knowing we are children of God.\nWhat it does.\nAccording to the Catholic Church, people can find God in their daily work and activities. There they can be very close to him. They do not have to become priests or monks to become a saint. God wants them to become a saint by doing their ordinary duties and activities well. The Catholic Church gave Opus Dei the job of spreading this knowledge, and teaching people that they can be real saints just by doing ordinary things and offering them to God.\nBeliefs, newness and problems.\nPope John Paul II praised Opus Dei and said that its aim of bringing God into the place of work is something great. Cardinal Albino Luciani, who later became Pope John Paul I, said that Escriva brought about a big change in how people deal with God. Before, people saw prayers as the only way to be close to God. Luciani said that Escriva also gave importance to work. The work one does can become prayer.\nBut when Escriva started teaching this, some Jesuits in the 1940s did not understand him. They said his beliefs were against the Catholic faith, because at that time Catholics thought that only priests and nuns could become holy. Some Jesuit leaders started saying that Opus Dei had secrets which it did not want the world to know, and that Opus Dei was dangerous. In fact, they said, Opus Dei just wanted to become very powerful and to control the world.\nAll these accusations were cleared up by the Popes and Catholic officials. These officials say that Opus Dei is doing something good for the world, by teaching people how to practice good habits, like telling the truth, working hard, keeping promises, loving people, and being concerned with those who are in need.\nHowever, since the Jesuits are well-respected, a lot of people in the world believed what they said. Opus Dei has gotten a lot of criticism from Catholics and non-Catholics. They say that the members develop a strong drive to gain influence, and that the behaviour resembles that of a sect. Critics of Opus Dei also say there is a lot of gender inequality in the organization. They say Opus Dei has a very traditional view of the role of women in a Christian society. According to these critics, for Opus Dei the duty of the woman is to busy herself about the house and to raise the children of the family.\nIn 2005, a writer named John L. Allen, Jr. wrote a book which argued against these accusations. He said that these claims are mainly based on not understanding Opus Dei. He argued that:\nAnother writer, Massimo Introvigne, said that Opus Dei is now being attacked by people who do not believe in God and people who think that God should not be present in the world of human beings. These people, he says, do not want religion to come back to the lives of many people in society."}

Usually a superhero is courageous and noble. They usually have a colorful name and costume.\nThe most well-known superheroes are Batman of DC and Spider-Man of Marvel.\nSome superheroes do not actually have super powers but are merely strong individuals who want to do good in the world. For example, Batman does not have any superpowers, but has been through years of training to be physically and mentally stronger than his enemies. \nMost superheroes keep their identities a secret by wearing masks or helmets. This protects the superheroes' friends and family from being hurt by villains. Also, because superheroes do not fight within the regulations of the law like police officers do, they would have to be arrested for vigilantism if they revealed their identities.\nAlso, many superheroes have tragic backstories that play into why they're superheroes in the first place. Batman, for example, saw both of his parents murdered in front of him and dedicated himself to fighting crime to prevent things like that happening to other people. Another example of this is Spider-Man who let a thief go that he could've easily stopped; that same thief later broke into his home and killed Spider-Man's uncle. After this, Spider-Man realized that he had to be responsible with his power and use it to help others."}

It was first published for PCs running Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Sony's PlayStation 2 video game console. It is the first game in the Half-Life series.\n\"Half-Life\", often shortened to \"HL\", has been thought to be very great by computer game critics for its gripping in-depth storyline, which has influenced the development of many other first-person shooters after it. It became very popular after it was released and still has many fans.\nPlot.\nThe story of the game takes place in a science research facility in New Mexico named Black Mesa. In the game, you play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist who works at Black Mesa. A test that Gordon helps with goes wrong, and causes a \"resonance cascade.\" This causes portals to appear all over Black Mesa. Aliens from a different dimension come through the portals and kill many of the scientists and workers. The dimension that the aliens come from is called Xen. After that, the United States Military is ordered to kill all the scientists and aliens in Black Mesa because they didn't want people to know about the accident. Gordon must fight aliens and marines on his way through Black Mesa, then teleport to Xen so he can kill the alien leader.\nExpansions.\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force.\n\"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" is the first expansion for Half-Life, which was made by Gearbox Software instead of Valve.

{"id": "15431", "revid": "239627", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15431", "title": "Spectroscopy", "text": "Spectroscopy is the study of light as a function of length of the wave that has been emitted, reflected or shone through a solid, liquid, or gas. To be analyzed the chemical is heated, because hot things glow and each chemical glows differently. The various wavelengths of the glow make a color spectrum that differs in some detail from other chemicals. Spectroscopy separates and measures the brightness of the different wavelengths. It can identify the chemicals in a mixture, and determine some other things, such as how hot the thing is.\nSpectroscopy allows scientists to investigate and explore things that are too small to be seen through a microscope, such as molecules, and the even smaller subatomic particles like protons, neutrons and electrons. There are special instruments to measure and analyze these light waves.\nMethods.\nInfrared spectroscopy measures light in the infrared electromagnetic spectrum. The highlight of IR spectroscopy is that it is very useful in identifying functional groups of organic molecules. The absorption of infrared light by organic molecules causes molecular vibrations. The vibrational frequencies are unique to the individual functional groups. IR spectra is given graphically by transmittance(%) vs. wavenumber (cm-1)\nX-ray crystallography can look at the structure of a crystalline molecule. The electron cloud of each atom diffracts the X-rays thus revealing the positions of the atoms. Various inorganic and organic molecules can be crystallized and used in this method including DNA, proteins, salts and metals. The sample used for analysis is not destroyed.\nUltraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy uses visible and ultraviolet light to look at how much of a chemical is in a liquid. The colour of the solution is the basis for how UV-Vis works. The color of the solution we are working with is colored because of its chemical composition. So the solution absorbs some light colors and reflects other colors, the light it reflects is the color of the solution. UV-Vis spectroscopy works by passing light through a sample of your solution then determining how much light gets absorbed by the solution.\nNuclear magnetic resonance can look at nuclei. It uses the magnetic properties of certain nuclei, the most common being 13C and 1H. The NMR instrument generates a large magnetic field that makes the nuclei act like tiny bar magnets. The nuclei either align with the instruments magnetic field or against it. At this point we have two possible orientations the nuclei could be in \u03b1 or \u03b2. Next the nuclei are exposed to radio waves that make \u03b1 go to the \u03b2 orientation. When this change occurs energy is given off and detected. The data is interpreted graphically (Intensity vs. chemical shifts in ppm) by a computer system. NMR does not destroy the sample you use for analysis. Below is a 900\u00a0MHz NMR system."}

It is a popular sport in countries like the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe. Horses are used in many different competitions.\nWithin the sport, there are several types of riding, such as English and Western. In English riding, there are three Olympic events: cross country, dressage and show jumping (in which competitors ride horses over obstacles). There are no forms of Western riding in the Olympics. \nShow jumping.\nIn show jumping, a rider rides a horse over a set course of horse jumps while being timed. Riders win by having the fastest time without mistakes. There are many types of horse jumps such as the vertical oxer (over two rails), and combinations (2 or 3 jumps put right after each other). \nNot every type of horse can jump well, just like not all horses are able to do well at horse racing or farm work. Most horses seen in show jumping competitions are warmbloods and throughbreds, horses that were bred for equestrian sports. The riding has been popular since 1900.\nDressage.\nDressage is an event where horses do not jump, but must be very obedient to their riders. There is usually a sequence that the horse and rider must complete. Letters are placed around an arena to show where movements should happen. In dressage the horse and rider can also perform a freestyle, which is also known as \"Dancing on Horseback\". Dressage riders usually wear tight pants called breeches, as well as a blouse, a top coat and a top hat. The moves of the horse are very graceful and people like to watch them. Horses that compete at the Olympics in dressage have had many years of training to learn all the moves they must do for the competition.\nEventing.\nEventing combines dressage, show jumping, and the horse version of cross country into one sport. This combined training is based on the old military tests of the cavalry where the rider's life depended on the horse listening to what the rider told it to do. Cross country makes this sport different from the other equestrian sports. It requires the horse to canter at a high speed over solid and interesting jumps. These jumps may be logs, stone walls, water, ditches, or banks. The cross country course is very long, and at the Olympics it may take as long as 10 minutes to complete the course.\nThe dressage test makes sure that the horse is listening to the rider. It tests that the horse is very well trained. The cross-country course makes sure that the horse is fast and brave, since cross-country fences may be very scary. The show jumping makes sure that the horse is in good shape, since he must do it the day after running over the long cross country course or on the same day. If the horse is too tired, he will hit the show jumps and make it harder for the rider to win.\nHunter-jumper.\nIn Hunter-jumpers, people ride horses in various classes. Some of those are Show jumping or Hunter-under-saddle. They are judged on the rider, not the horse. Any type of horse or pony can compete.\nStock work.\nStock work began when horses were ridden on a ranch to round up cows, sheep, or other animals. Today, horse shows also have competitions for horses to show these skills. These include Cutting, Reining, Barrel Racing, Cattle Penning, Calf Roping, Campdrafting, and Pole Bending.\nDriving.\nDriving in the horse world means that a horse is pulling a type of wagon. It knows where to go by a person sitting on the wagon that tells them which direction they should turn. A horse used to pull a wagon is usually bigger and heavier than most other horses. The hooves are also much larger than a racing horse. Large horses are calm, trustworthy and good-natured. Types of heavy horses are: Belgians, Shires, Clydesdale, Friesian horse, and Gypsy Vanners. Also a beginner is able to communicate with these well tempered horses.\nRaces of horses pulling carts are called harness racing. The horses are smaller.\nRacing.\nHorse racing tests the speed of a horse. Different breeds do different types of races. The most popular type in the U.S. is Thoroughbred racing, where only horses of this breed can participate in galloping around a track. There are also endurance races, trotting races and steeplechases (horses galloping around a track with jumps). Most horses that are used for racing are ridden by professional riders called jockeys. Usually the people that own or train the horse do not ride it in the races.\nBarrel racing is a sport where the rider rides the horse in a pattern around three barrels. The rider must be able to turn the horse very quickly around the barrels. The horse that does the pattern the fastest is the winner.\nPleasure riding.\nPleasure riding is riding for enjoyment, not for awards. People ride horses on trails in the forest, along quiet roads, or in an arena near their homes or barns. Horse back riding lessons could be considered pleasure riding. Pleasure riding can be called trail riding. Pleasure riding does not have to be for any specific reason, just for fun and enjoyment. Riding in a horse carriage may also be for pleasure. \nEndurance riding is an equestrian long-distance race. There are two main types of endurance rides which are competitive trail riding and endurance rides. "}

One confirmed that any slave brought to New York was automatically set free. The other ended the racial segregation of streetcars in the city. \nAfter President James A.

He was crowned as the Emperor on Christmas Day, 800. He was the older son of King Pippin III of the Carolingian dynasty. When Pippin died, Charlemagne and his brother Carloman ruled together. When Carloman died in 771 Charlemagne became the only ruler of the Franks.\nLife.\nThe Franks\u2014one of the Germanic peoples who had moved their homes over the River Rhine into the Roman Empire as it was falling apart\u2014were, by the year 700, the rulers of Gaul, and a lot of Germania east of the Rhine. They also protected the Papacy and the Roman Catholic faith. When their king Pepin the Short died, his sons, Charlemagne and Carloman were chosen to share the kingdom. They divided it into two parts: one half for Charlemagne, and the other for Carloman. Carloman died on December 4, 771, leaving Charlemagne as the leader of the whole Frankish kingdom.\nHe was king of the Franks from 768, and king of the Lombards from 774. He was crowned Imperator Augustus (Emperor) in Rome on Christmas Day by Pope Leo III in 800, starting the Holy Roman Empire, that they hoped would be a kind of second Western Roman Empire (while the Byzantines in Constantinople were still keeping up the Eastern Roman empire). With many wars, Charlemagne spread his empire across much of Western Europe.\nCharlemagne fought in many wars over the course of his reign. He is known for using his sword, \u201cJoyeuse\u201d, in each of the thirty years of war and the 18 battles he fought in. He also finally managed to conquer Saxony, something the Roman Emperor Augustus could not do 800 years earlier. He was able to convert the Saxons to Catholic Christianity. He also had many schools built so his people could learn. However, he also killed thousands of those who failed to convert.\nDeath.\nCharlemagne's politics and plans failed, which led to low self-esteem. His last years were spent in bed in deep depression. He died in 814, leaving his kingdom to his only son, Louis the Pious. The descendants of Charlemagne are called \"Carolingians\". His family line died out in Germany in 911 and in France in 987."}

The movement began in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna. It ended in 1871, when Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy by the efforts of Count of Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian national hero who united southern Italy. That allowed King Victor Emmanuel II to become the first king of Italy.\nNapol\u00e9on's defeat of Napoleon.\nNapol\u00e9on Bonaparte invaded Italy in 1796 and later controlled it. When he was defeated in 1815, at the Battle of Waterloo, the free states could now join together.\nThe Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815) restored the prewar \"ancien r\u00e9gime\". The Austrian Empire, ruled by the Habsburgs, controlled most of Italy.\nConquest of Sardinia.\nVictor Emmanuel of Piedmont-Sardinia had a great vision of a unified Italy. He wanted Piedmont-Sardinia to be a model for the unification of Italy. To do so, he started many public works, projects, and political reforms. Piedmont-Sardinia was soon recognized as an emerging power. The next step for its conquest was to get Austria out of the Italian Peninsula.\nWith the Crimean War breaking out between France and Britain on one side, and Russia on the other, Piedmont-Sardinia had a chance to earn some respect and to make a name for itself. Britain and France proved victorious, and Sardinia was able to attend the peace conference. As a result, Piedmont-Sardinia gained the support of French Emperor Napol\u00e9on III.\nWar against Austria.\nIn 1858, Sardinia and France secretly plotted a plan of attack against Austria. The following year, Sardinia put its plan into action. Instead of attacking, Sardinia encouraged nationalist revolts in th Austrian-held territories in Italy to provoke Austria into starting the war. Following the Battles of Magenta and Solferino, France drove Austria out of Lombardy, but Austria still held onto Venetia.\nFrance then dropped out of the war, since it feared that a unified Italy might be a threat and realized that the Austrian strength would eventually crush the French. That ended the war, with Austria keeping Venetia.\nCompletion of unification.\nMeanwhile, the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi led a nationalist uprising to join the states and territories into one republic. As Sardinia ended the war, Garibaldi gave it most of the provinces. In March 1861, a parliament of all of Italy except Rome and Venetia agreed to unify Italy with Victor Emmanuel as its first king. When Prussia defeated Austria in a war in 1866, Italy struck a deal with Berlin to force Vienna to turn over Venetia, which left Rome as the last Italian city not yet added.\nFranco-Prussian War.\nBecause of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, France sent its army away from Rome. Without protection, the Pope could not resist, and Rome finally became the capital of Italy."}

Scholars have found meditation difficult to define. The practices vary both between traditions and within them.\nIt is a common practice in many religions including Buddhism, Christianity (sometimes), Taoism, Hinduism (where Yoga is important)\nand other religions. Meditation has now become a modern trend, showing many health benefits.\nThe initial origin of meditation is from the Vedic times of India.\nBuddhist meditation.\nIn Buddhism, three things are very important: being a good person, making the mind stronger, and understanding (Insight or Wisdom) about why people are in pain (Dukkha). For Buddhists, meditation is used to calm the mind so that the mind can better see the cause of pain. Buddhists believe that this type of seeing can end pain.\nBuddhist meditation is not just used for spiritual reasons. Research shows that Buddhist meditation lowers stress, anxiety and depression.\nMost types of Buddhist meditation focus on something. The most popular things to focus on include breath, metta or Loving-Kindness towards all, other recollections, situational mindfulness and religious images and sounds.\nChristian meditation.\nChristians sometimes meditate by thinking about small parts of the Bible, or by saying the words of a prayer to themselves over and over. Meditation is an expression of Christian prayer. In the Catechism of the Catholic Church is specified that by means of meditation \"The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking\"; also it is pointed out that \"meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ\".\nMeditation is principally made on the Sacred Scriptures with the Gospels, liturgical texts, writings of the spiritual fathers, and meditative devotions.\nMeditation is a significant part of the devotion of the Rosary; \"by virtue of its meditative character, with the tranquil succession of Hail Marys, the Rosary has a peaceful effect on those who pray it, disposing them to receive and experience in their innermost depths, and to spread around them, that true peace which is the special gift of the Risen Lord (cf.

The whole system is called the auditory system. \nThe inner part of the ear is common to most vertebrates, but mammals have special adaptations for hearing which even other land vertebrates do not have. These include the external ear and the three little bones which transmit sounds (the ossicles). The part of the ear that sticks out and can be seen is called the \"pinna.\" \nEars are also used in other ways. African elephants use their large ears to cool themselves when it is very hot.

As a Republican president, Taft was most notable for trust-busting, in which he broke up large businesses that had too much control over the economy.

{"id": "15512", "revid": "1081468", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15512", "title": "Underwear", "text": "Underwear are clothes worn under other clothes, often next to the skin. They keep outer clothes from being made dirty by sweat. They also shape the body and provide support for parts of it, and in cold weather help the wearer to keep warm. Underwear can be used to protect the wearer's modesty, as well as to make them look sexy. Special types of underwear have religious importance. Some items of clothing are made to be worn as underwear, while others such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts can be used both as underwear and as outer clothing. If made of suitable fabric, some types of underwear can serve as nightwear or swimsuits.\nItems of underwear commonly worn by women today include brassieres (bras) and panties (also known as knickers), while men wear briefs, trunks, boxer shorts or boxer briefs. Items worn by both women and men include T-shirts, sleeveless shirts, bikini underwear, thongs, T-fronts and G-strings. In countries where the weather is cold, long underwear can be worn to keep warm.\nDifferent words.\nThere are a number of different words for underwear: 'underclothes', 'underclothing' and 'undergarments' are more formal words. \nFemale.\nIn casual situations, underwear may be called 'undies'. In Australia, one may hear underwear being called 'Reg Grundys' or 'Reginalds' (rhyming slang for 'undies'), while in the UK the word 'smalls' is sometimes used. Different types of women's undergarments are known together as 'lingerie' (pronounced \"-zhur-ray\"). They may also be called 'intimate clothing' or simply 'intimates'.\nWords for the top half of female lingerie: 'bras', obviously. Note the use of 'teddy' for a one-piece close-fitting nightwear. \nWords for the bottom half of female lingerie: pants (US) versus knickers, drawers or panties, but never pants! (UK). 'Briefs' is another possible. 'French knickers' = knickers with frills, looser-fitting. Note the French \"cache-sex\" as a prototype 'G-string. Other types of undergarments are spandex shorts common for women who workout. These shorts are used because it supports the behind and the back for good posture.\nMale.\nAn \"undershirt\" is old word for a piece of underwear covering the torso, which has fallen out of usage in the UK, but is still commonly used in North America. \"Vests\" is by far the most common term in UK. \"Underpants\" or \"pants\" cover the part of the body where the sex organs are, but never \"drawers\". Most common words: \"shorts \" as in \"boxer shorts\" for the looser fit. \"Y-fronts\" for the tight fit (UK), \"boxers\" or \"briefs\" used for the same things in Canada and the USA.\nThese and other words for different types of underwear are set out in the table below. The slang word for a man going without underwear is called \"free-balling\". The slang word fo a bulge in a man's underwear is called \"mooseknuckle\".\nFunction.\nUnderwear is worn for many reasons. They keep outer clothes from being made dirty by sweat. Men's briefs provide support for the male sex organs, and women's brassieres (bras) do the same thing for their breasts. Some people wear corsets to make their torsos a certain shape. For more support and protection when playing sports, people often put on underwear that fits more tightly for extra support. Men may wear jockstraps and trunks (which are a type of boxer shorts). Women may wear sports bras and pelvic protectors. Sports bras lessens the chance of damage to the ligaments of the chest during vigorous exercises such as jogging.\nIn countries where the weather is cold, underwear is one more layer of clothing that helps the wearer to keep warm. Underwear can be used to keep the wearer modest \u2013 for instance, some women wear camisoles and slips (petticoats) under clothes that are see-through. A camisole is an item of clothing without sleeves that covers the top part of a woman's body, while a slip or petticoat is a kind of skirt that is worn underneath an outer skirt. On the other hand, underwear can also be worn to make a person look more sexy. It is possible to buy underwear made specially to excite another person in a sexual way, such as underwear that can be eaten (it is usually made of small sweets stuck together) and underwear with holes cut into them.\nSome items of clothing are designed to be worn as underwear, while others such as T-shirts can be used both as underwear and as outer clothing. Whether underwear can be used as outer clothing depends on a number of things, such as how warm it is indoors and outdoors, what other people in society find acceptable, fashion, and what the law allows. Some types of underwear can be used for sleeping in or as swimsuits, if they are made of suitable fabric.\nReligious uses.\nUnderwear can also have religious use:\nTypes and styles.\nThe table below sets out types and styles of underwear that are commonfly worn.\nFashions and trends.\nDesigners and retailers.\nA number of big clothes designers are well known for their underwear collections. Two of these are Calvin Klein and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. There are also companies that make only underwear, such as 2(x)ist, Agent Provocateur, C-IN2, GapBody, Gilly Hicks, Ginch Gonch, La Senza, Fruit of the Loom, Lord, and Victoria's Secret.\nExposed underwear.\nAlthough most of the time underwear is kept hidden under other clothes, sometimes it is partly exposed for fashion reasons or to make other people feel sexually excited when they see it. A woman may, for instance, allow the top of her bra to peek out from under her collar, or wear a see-through blouse over it. Some men wear T-shirts underneath partly- or fully-unbuttoned shirts.\nA common style among young men is to allow their trousers to sag or droop down below their waists. This fashion is called \"sagging\". When a person allows his trousers to sag, the waistband or a larger part of his underpants can be seen. A woman wearing trousers which expose the upper back portion of her thong underwear is said to show a \"whale tail\".\nNot wearing underpants.\nNot wearing underpants under one's outer clothing is known in American slang as \"freeballing\" for men or \"freebuffing\" for women. The term \"going commando\" is also used at times, for both sexes. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts and kilts, are meant to be worn or are traditionally worn without underpants."}

His song was called Cara al Sol.\nHe was friend of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.\nHe was a leader of a coup d'\u00e9tat against the Spanish Second Republic in 1936. After this uprising the Spanish Civil War started. Franco was supported by fascists, big businesses, the church, conservative people and Spanish nationalists. This was because the Spanish Republic had a socialist government that wanted to make businesses and the church less powerful. The Republic also set up local parliaments in the regions of Spain. Spanish nationalists thought this was wrong and would make Spain weak. Franco remained neutral during World War II as Hitler did not accept his conditions for Spain to take part in it with the fascist and nazi regimes. He let a group of volunteer soldiers join the German Army to fight the Russians between 1941 and 1943. They were called the \"Divisi\u00f3n Azul\" (Blue Division)\nFranco died in Madrid on November 20, 1975, just after midnight of heart failure. Relatives, such as his daughter Carmen, had asked doctors to remove his life support systems. After Franco's death, Juan Carlos became king."}

Police officers arrest criminals, prevent crime, protect and help the public, and keep public order. Officers have legally authorised powers, which in Britain is called a \"warrant\".\nPowers and duties.\nA police officer's job is to protect the public, make sure people obey the law and make people feel safe. Not all police officers wear a uniform and patrol. Some police officers have specialist jobs, such as being a detective, a traffic officer or a police dog handler. In some countries, not all police carry guns, so a police officer could choose to become an armed police officer after a lot of experience.\nAs a part of their job, police officers have rights that other people do not have. This might include the power to arrest a person who they think has committed a crime, the power to search a person, the power to stop cars and direct traffic, the power to ask for a person's name and address, the power to give out tickets or fines or the power to make a person come to court. Without these powers the police would not be able to gain any sort of control over society. \nBeing a police officer can be dangerous. Police officers are sometimes killed or hurt by criminals when they are sent to incidents, so that is why the police have to carry the equipment needed to defend themselves. Police officers have the right to carry weapons, such as a gun or a baton in order to stop crime even if the weapon laws are strict and limited to the general public.\nEquipment.\nIn different countries, police officers are given different equipment to deal with the crime that is in their country. Police officers are armed with weapons that they can use to defend themselves or other people that need help. Most police officers carry these things:\nPolice officers have to patrol and respond to emergencies as quickly as possible. Some police officers will walk on foot patrol, but often police officers will patrol in a police car. This is so that they can get to emergencies faster and carry more equipment. Sometimes officers patrol on bicycles, motorbikes or on horses if they are in a unit that does this."}

{"id": "15538", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15538", "title": "Dutch people", "text": "The Dutch are the people who live in the Netherlands, or those that come from the Netherlands. Often the Netherlands is called Holland, but this is only part of the Netherlands. The Dutch culture and ethnicity are also found outside of the Netherlands, with large number of Dutch living in the United States of America, South Africa, Suriname, and Namibia.\nMany inventors were Dutch, including Hans Lippershey and Zacharias Janssen, said to have invented the microscope and the telescope. Many famous painters have also been Dutch, among them Rembrandt van Rijn, Vincent van Gogh and Johannes Vermeer.\nThe definition of ethnicity is not always clear. One can count all people living in the Netherlands as Dutch, but many are not. This is because many people who live in The Netherlands were not born there. About 15.5 million people in the Netherlands actually have the Dutch nationality. About 1 million people living in the Netherlands do not have the Dutch nationality. To make things more confusing, people who live in the other parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (including Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Sint Maarten, and the Caribbean Netherlands) also have Dutch nationality. Still, even more people in the Netherlands who were not born there can also be called \"Dutch\". According to some definitions, also people who were born in the Netherlands, but whose parents were not, cannot be called Dutch. This definition leaves almost 20% of the entire Dutch population to be 'foreign'.\nDemographics.\nThroughout the world there are about 30 million Dutch people:\nPopulation growth.\nDuring the last 150 years, the Netherlands saw a relatively quick population growth as compared to the rest of Europe. For comparison: The Belgian population grew from 50% more inhabitants in 1850 to a third less in 2000. The population of the Netherlands grew from 3 million in 1850, to 5 million in 1900, to 10 million in 1950, to 16 million in 2000.\nModern Day Society.\nThe Dutch society in the present can be seen as a very multicultural society. About 20% of the entire Dutch population is not of Dutch origin (these people are called \"allochtoon\" in Dutch). Even most members of the Dutch Royal family are allochtoon. This comes from the fact that the Netherlands were tolerant of other nationalities and other religions since the beginning of the Dutch Republic (in 1588). In the 17th century, it was not odd, for instance for Muslims to live in Amsterdam. Starting in the 1960s many workers from Turkey and Morocco came to the Netherlands for temporary work. Many of these guest workers (\"gastarbeiders\") stayed on in the Netherlands. Therefore, The Netherlands have a large Turkish and Moroccan community. Immigration from especially the former colonies Suriname and Indonesia also led to the multi-cultural society of the present. Recent events (like the murder of Theo van Gogh by a radical Muslim) have led to negative views on \"allochtonen\" by some of the Dutch people.\nThe Dutch society is also famous for its liberal views. The Netherlands were the first country to legalize same-sex marriage (the marriage of homosexuals). The Netherlands have a strong gay-rights movement. Abortion and euthanasia are also legal in the Netherlands under strict conditions. The Netherlands are also the only country in the world where the use of marijuana is \"gedoogd\". This means it is not legal to produce but the laws against the use of it are not actively enforced.\nThe Netherlands are one of the busiest countries in the world. Some 17.2 million registered people live in the small country by July 2018. Most Dutch people live in cities, with a city being a place with at least 25,000 people living there. 8.7 million Dutch live in \"agglomerations\" (urban areas which are connected to each other, a sort of metropolitan area). That's about 54% of all the Dutch people. About 15% of the Dutch people live in city's which are not in an agglomeration. The other 30% live in villages (places with less than 25,000 people).\nTravel.\nThe Netherlands are a country where bicycles are used very much. Almost 30% of all travel is done by bicycle in the Netherlands. Bicycles are used so much so that throughout the Netherlands hundreds of bicycle parking lots (\"fietsenstallingen\") are built. In Amsterdam, there is even a 3-story high bicycle parking lot. Trains are also used very much (unlike in, for instance, the US). The biggest railway company (NS) has 1.1 million travellers per day. That's 7 percent of the entire Dutch population each day."}

It was originally called Mistake Out and was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951, who was working at a bank in the U.S. state of Texas at time and had trouble when she typed on the typewriter, which was part of her job. She made the product by mixing the required substances with her blender and sold it to friends starting in 1956. She sold the product to the Gillette Corporation for 47.5 million US Dollars in 1979. When she died the following year, her son, Michael Nesmith, a famous musician, formally of The Monkees inherited the fortune.\nNow people still use the correction fluid, but more seldom. With more advanced technology, people have computers allowing them to backspace easily, not needing to use it. Also, there is also another recent invention of the correction tape. To use the fluid, you squeeze the bottle, and let the fluid flow out to cover the mistakes. Usually you have to shake the bottle before using it, and after using, you need to wait for it to dry for a few minutes, which is considered quite fast. Then you can write on top of the dried fluid."}

{"id": "15549", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15549", "title": "Jack the Ripper", "text": "Jack the Ripper is the name given to an unidentified serial killer. He was active during the summer and autumn of 1888 in the Whitechapel district of London, England, which was known for its overpopulation and prostitution.\nThe main victims thought to be killed by the Ripper were five prostitutes:\nNewspapers and police in London around this time started to get taunting letters. The letters were signed \"Jack the Ripper\". Other murders were reported around the same time, but were not thought to be done by Jack the Ripper. He was also known to have sex with his victims before he killed them.\nWho was Jack the Ripper?\nNobody knows who Jack the Ripper really was. Some think he might have been a doctor or a butcher because of how he killed and cut up the women, much like how a surgeon might perform surgery, or how a butcher might dissect an animal. All the murders happened on weekends, so it could have been someone who did not live in London but visited the city on weekends, or someone who worked during the week and was only free at the weekends.\nIn September 2014, a research group claimed that it had identified Jack the Ripper as a 23-year old Jewish immigrant from Central Europe named Aaron Kosminski.\nJack the Ripper's first murders.\nThe Ripper was famous for the brutality of his murders. He often mutilated his victims, usually killing them by slashing their throats open, almost to the point of decapitation, and stabbing them multiple times, especially in the abdomen. At about 23:00 on 30 August, Mary Ann Nichols was seen walking the Whitechapel Road; at 00:30 she was seen to leave a pub in Brick Lane, Spitalfields. An hour later, she was turned out of 18 Thrawl Street as she was lacking fourpence for a bed, implying by her last words that she would soon earn the money on the street with the help of a new bonnet she had acquired. She was later seen at the corner of Osborn Street and Whitechapel Road, at 02:30, an hour before her death, by Nelly Holland. Nichols claimed she had made enough money to pay for her bed three times over, but had drunk it all away, it was the last time she was seen alive. An hour later, she was found lying dead in front of a gated stable entrance in Buck's Row (since renamed Durward Street), Whitechapel, her throat cut and her abdomen ripped open. Nobody had seen or heard a thing, the killer struck again on 8 September, Annie Chapman was seen talking to a man at about 5:30\u00a0a.m. just beyond the backyard of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Mrs. Long described him as over forty, and a little taller than Chapman, of dark complexion, and of foreign, \"shabby-genteel\" appearance. He was wearing a deer-stalker hat and dark overcoat, carpenter Albert Cadosch had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street seconds later, and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence. Chapman's body was discovered at just before 6:00\u00a0a.m. on the morning of 8 September 1888 by a resident of number 29, market porter John Davis. She was lying on the ground near a doorway in the back yard. Her throat was cut from left to right, and she had been disembowelled, with her intestines thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. Chapman's protruding tongue and swollen face led Dr Phillips to think that she may have been asphyxiated with the handkerchief around her neck before her throat was cut.\nLetters.\n\"Dear Boss\".\nTwo weeks later, a letter was sent claimed to have been written by the killer himself. The letter, received on September 27 1888, was signed \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper.\" The law enforcement and newspapers referred to him as the Ripper from that point on. The letter read:\n\"From Hell\".\nThe \"From Hell\" letter was received by George Lusk, leader of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, on 16 October 1888. The handwriting and style is unlike that of the \"Dear Boss\" letter and postcard. The letter came with a small box in which Lusk discovered half of a kidney, preserved in \"spirits of wine\" (ethanol). Eddowes' left kidney had been removed by the killer. The writer claimed that he \"fried and ate\" the missing kidney half. There is disagreement over the kidney: some contend it belonged to Eddowes, while others argue it was nothing more than a macabre practical joke. The kidney was examined by Dr Thomas Openshaw of the London Hospital, who determined that it was human and from the left side, but (contrary to false newspaper reports) he could not determine its gender or age. Openshaw subsequently also received a letter signed \"Jack the Ripper\".\nDouble murders.\nElizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were killed in the early morning of Sunday 30 September 1888. Stride's body was discovered at about 1 a.m., in Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street (now Henriques Street) in Whitechapel. The cause of death was one clear-cut incision which severed the main artery on the left side of the neck. Uncertainty about whether Stride's murder should be attributed to the Ripper, or whether he was interrupted during the attack, stems from the absence of mutilations to the abdomen. Witnesses who said they saw Stride with a man earlier that night gave differing descriptions: some said her companion was fair, others dark; some said he was shabbily dressed, others well-dressed. Eddowes' body was found in Mitre Square, in the City of London, three-quarters of an hour after Stride's. The throat was severed, and the abdomen was ripped open by a long, deep, jagged wound. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed. A local man, Joseph Lawende, had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder, and he described seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes. His companions, however, were unable to confirm his description. Eddowes' and Stride's murders were later called the \"double event\". Part of Eddowes' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Some writing on the wall above the apron piece, which became known as the Goulston Street graffito, seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews, but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece, or merely incidental.Police Commissioner Charles Warren feared the graffito might spark antisemitic riots, and ordered it washed away before dawn. The \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard was postmarked 1 October 1888 and received the same day by the Central News Agency. The handwriting was similar to the \"Dear Boss\" letter. It mentions that two victims were killed very close to one another: \"double event this time\", which was thought to refer to the murders of Stride and Eddowes. It has been argued that the letter was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime, but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place, long after details were known by journalists and residents of the area.\nThe end of the crimes.\nMary Jane Kelly was seen with a man of \"Jewish appearance\". Kelly and the man headed for her room at 13 Miller's Court, Elizabeth Prater, who was woken by her kitten walking over her neck, and Sarah Lewis both reported hearing a faint cry of \"Murder!\" at about 4:00\u00a0a.m., but did not react because they reported that it was common to hear such cries in the East End. She claimed not to have slept and to have heard people moving in and out of the court throughout the night. She thought she heard someone leaving the residence at about 5:45\u00a0a.m. Kelly's gruesomely mutilated body was discovered the next morning lying on the bed at 10:45\u00a0a.m. on Friday 9 November 1888. The throat had been severed down to the spine, and the abdomen virtually emptied of its organs. The heart was missing.\nAfter the murder of Mary Jane Kelly, the Ripper murders stopped suddenly. The identity of Jack the Ripper is unknown. Although many historians have different opinions and theories on who Jack the Ripper was, it will probably never be known who he was."}

He became famous for painting in the abstract expressionist style. Pollock's most famous paintings were made by dripping and splashing paint on a large canvas. His nickname was Jack the Dripper. Because of the method, this style is often called \"action painting\". Pollock was helped by his wife, artist Lee Krasner, and her style was very new at the time. His real name is Paul.Jackson is his middle name.\nPollock was bitter, and had serious drinking problems with alcohol. His paintings are in museums all over the world, and his work is rated very high. Pollock has been the subject of many movies because of his interesting life. The most famous was a short documentary movie directed by Hans Namuth in 1951, and the 2000 movie about his life called \"Pollock\", made by and starring actor Ed Harris. Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming. In 1956, he was killed in a car crash in Springs, New York at the age of 44 years old.\nThe unique technique.\nPollock was introduced to the use of liquid paint in 1936 at an experimental workshop operated in New York City by the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. He later used paint pouring as one of several techniques on canvases of the early 1940s, such as \"Male and Female\" and \"Composition with Pouring I.\" After his move to Springs, New York, he began painting with his canvases laid out on the studio floor, and he developed what was later called his drip technique.\nPollock described this use of household paints, instead of artist\u2019s paints, as \"a natural growth out of a need\". He used hardened brushes, sticks, and even basting syringes as paint applicators. With this technique, Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art, the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas. By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension, literally, by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions.\nLater, Pollock turned to synthetic resin-based paints called alkyd enamels, which, at that time, was a novel medium. In 1956, \"Time\" magazine called Pollock \"Jack the Dripper\" as a result of his unique painting style.\nInfluences on his dripping technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism. Pollock denied \"the accident\"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see.\nExpensive painting.\nPollock's \"No. 5, 1948\" stands at the fifth highest price ever for a work of art. It was privately sold by Sotheby's for (price adjusted) US$163.8 million dollars. it was the most famous painting in whole entire world - which is phenomenal well done Paul (Jackson Pollock)."}

He founded the Timurid Empire in 1370. The empire was large and included Transoxiana, parts of Turkestan, Afghanistan, Persia, Syria, Qurdistan, Baghdad, Georgia and Asia Minor. He successfully conquered southern Russia and parts of India. He invaded Delhi in 1398. He called himself \"Sword of Islam\". He is also known to have invented the Tamerlane Chess.\nNot related to Genghis Khan but claiming to be his successor, he caused the death of thousands of people. Timur is considered the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe. His empire led to the Gunpowder Empires in the 1500s and 1600s, most notably the Mughal Empire of India.\nName.\nHis real name is \"T\u012bm\u016br bin Taraghay Barlas\". He is also known by these names: Temur, Taimur, Timur Lenk, Timur-i Leng, Temur-e Lang, Amir Timur, Aqsaq Timur, and Tamburlaine. \nConquests.\nHe began his military career after conquering Movarounnahr (now Uzbekistan) through various political betrayals and military campaigns. In allegiance with other rulers in the area, he spent the next ten years fighting to gain territory, supporting the Khan empire against the Russians and defeating many large, imposing armies. \nBut this was only the beginning. In 1383, Tamerlane began conquering Persia, challenging several rival dynasties in an effort to preserve his empire and expand his territory.\nAfter securing the majority of eastern Persia and defeating a major Mongol king, Tokhtamysh, Tamerlane and his army occupied Moscow for a year. During his time of absence from Persia, major revolts broke out. So he repressed them. Knowing his home territory of Samarkand was being handled by his military forces, Tamerlane then attacked India. He crossed the Indus River in 1398 and marched his army into Delhi where he reduced much of the city, an event that would cause a great setback for the region. As a result of this conquest, he left the territory with an immense quantity of spoil, using 90 captured elephants to carry treasure and stones from quarries to erect a mosque in his homeland.\nIn 1399, Tamerlane organized a new military expedition to attack the sultan of Egypt for territory infringement and marching on Syria, he stormed and sacked the city of Aleppo. In 1401, his army occupied the city of Damascus. He then moved on to storm Baghdad that same year and massacred 20,000 of its citizens, destroying all of its buildings and significant monuments in the process. \nTimur and his army of 200,000 soldiers traveled through deep snow and frozen rivers toward China, eventually stopping in what is now Kazakhstan for a rest. Timur caught a cold and died on the journey. The trip to China stopped, and his body was taken home to Samarkand where it was buried beneath the dome of the Gur Amir mausoleum in a steel coffin under a slab of black jade six feet long. On the stone was inscribed, \"\u201cThis is the resting place of the illustrious and merciful monarch, the most great sultan, the most mighty warrior, Lord Timur, Conqueror of the World.\u201d\""}

He led Rome in its transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire.\nLife.\nOctavian, as he was originally called, was the adopted son of the complete ruler of the Roman Republic, Julius Caesar. Octavian came into power in the Second Triumvirate. This was three men ruling over the Roman Republic: Mark Antony, Lepidus and Octavian.\nAll three were loyal to Julius Caesar, the dictator who was killed in 44 BC. Following his death, a war in Rome began, between those loyal to Caesar, and the conspirators, led by two of Caesar's assassinators, Brutus and Cassius.\nAt first, Octavian was the junior partner in the triumvirate. Lepidus was more experienced in government, and Mark Antony was a fine military leader. The triumvirate defeated Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi, 42 BC, largely due to Antony's leadership. Then they split the leadership of the Republic three ways. Antony took the east, Lepidus took Spain and part of North Africa, and Octavian took Italy.\nAntony followed in Caesar's footsteps by going to Egypt and becoming Cleopatra's lover. They had three children together. His absence from Rome allowed the intelligent Octavian to build up support.\nThe triumvirate broke up in 33 BC, and disagreement turned to civil war in 31 BC. Antony was defeated by Octavian at the naval Battle of Actium and then at Alexandria. He committed suicide, as did his lover, Cleopatra VII of Egypt, in 30 BC. Lepidus was sidelined, blamed for a revolt in Sicily, and removed from government. He died peacefully in exile in Circeii in Italy in the year 13 BC.\nAfter winning the power struggle, Octavian was voted as Emperor by the Roman Senate in 31 BC. He took the name \"Augustus\" (which meant 'exalted'). He ruled until AD 14, when his stepson and son-in-law Tiberius became Emperor in his place.\nDuring his reign, some of those who were against his government were murdered (especially those senators who wanted to keep the Roman Republic). He promised to make Rome a Republic again, but instead proclaimed himself High Priest (\"Pontifex Maximus\"). Many temples in the provinces set up statues of him as one of their gods. The name of the month \"August\" in English (and most other European languages) comes from him.\nHis main accomplishment was the creation of the Roman Empire, a political structure that lasted for nearly five centuries more. He first recruited and set up the Praetorian Guard.\nAncient sources.\nHistorians often use the Res Gestae Divi Augusti as a source for Augustus. It was written by him as an inscription on his tomb which recorded all his achievements.\nThe historian Tacitus is often used by historians. He gives an anti-Augustan perspective, whereas many other sources and histories were written to flatter Augustus (propaganda). Some examples of writers like these are Velleius Paterculus, Virgil, Ovid. The most famous work of Augustan propaganda is the Virgil's Aeneid\nCassius Dio presents a quite impartial account of Augustus as emperor: he was writing in the reign of a later emperor.\nLegacies.\nThere are important legacies from Augustus. They go from the creation of the \"Roman Empire\" to the name of the eight month of the year until the establishment of the province called \"Italia\" (within its actual borders and \"regions\" for the first time in History). Other minor legacies are the establishment of the institution called \"family\" with surnames for all Roman citizens (previously only the aristocracy had \"paters\"), the creation of the first \"fire fighters\" in human History (for the city of Rome) and the set up of the Praetorian Guard as an elite of warriors.\nMonth of August.\nThe month of August (Latin: \"Augustus\") is named after Augustus; until his time it was called \"Sextilis\" (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original Roman calendar and the Latin word for six is \"sex\"). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see Julian calendar). \nAccording to a \"senatus consultum\" quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.\nCreation of \"Italia\".\nRoman Italy was created officially by the Roman Emperor Augustus with the Latin name \"Italia\". It was the first time in History that the Italian peninsula (from the Alps to the Ionian Sea) was united under the same name. Augustus was also called \"Father of Italy\" by Italian historians like Giannelli, because of this political/administrative decision. Around 7 BC, Augustus divided Italy into eleven \"regiones\", as reported by Pliny the Elder in his \"Naturalis Historia\". The following are the subdivisions/regions of his \"Italia\" (many are still existing today):\nItaly was privileged by Augustus and his heirs, with the construction, among other public structures, of a dense network of Roman roads. \nThe Italian economy flourished: agriculture, handicraft and industry had a sensible growth, allowing the export of goods to the other provinces. \nThe Italian population may have grown as well: three census were ordered by Augustus (the first in Italian History), to record the number of Roman citizens throughout the empire. The surviving totals were 4,063,000 in 28 BC, 4,233,000 in 8 BC, and 4,937,000 in 14 AD, but it is still debated whether these counted all citizens, all adult male citizens, or only citizens \"sui iuris\". \nEstimates for the population of mainland Italy, including Cisalpine Gaul, at the beginning of the 1st century range from 6,000,000 according to Karl Julius Beloch in 1886, to 14,000,000 according to Elio Lo Cascio in 2009. These calculations included the slaves, who were approximately one fifth of the total.\nIn the year 292 AD, the three islands of Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily (including Malta) were added to Augustus' Roman Italy by the emperor Diocletian. \nRoman Italy remained united until the sixth century, when it was divided between Byzantine and barbarian territories. Since then \"Italia\" remained divided for nearly thirteen centuries until 1861 when was reunited in a similar way in the modern \"Kingdom of Italy\"."}

There are three living species of camels. Best-known are the dromedary (one hump) and bactrian (two humps) camels.\nThe camelids, as a family, include the \"New World\" camelids: the llama, the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicu\u00f1a.\nThe earliest known camel, called \"Protylopus\", lived in North America 40 to 50 million years ago, during the Eocene. It was about the size of a rabbit and lived in the open woodlands of what is now South Dakota.\nHabitat and adaptation.\nCamels live in deserts, where it is hot and dry. Camels have adapted and found ways to help them survive in deserts. They have a thick coat of hair that protects them from the heat in the day, and keeps them warm at night. Their large feet spreads their weight on the sand when they are walking. When there is food and water, a camel can eat and drink large amounts of it and store it as fat in the hump. Then, when there is no food or water, the camel uses the fat for energy, and the hump becomes small and soft. A camel\u2019s waste contains very little water. Even the water from the camel\u2019s breath flows back into its mouth. The camels have bushy eyebrows that don't let the sand go in their eyes in a sandstorm. It has a long slender neck in order to reach high leaves such as palm trees, and rubbery patches on the belly and knees to protect the skin when kneeling and sitting on the hot sand. These form after five years of age.\nA camel has a naturally adapted temperature regulation - it can change its bodily temperature by six degrees Celsius either way. \nIt has two sets of eyelashes, closing muscles in the nasal passages, hairy ears and tough, leathery skin to protect the camels skin in sandstorms. It has thick rubbery lips to eat dry, prickly plants and a large, haired tail to swat pests such as mosquitos and flies.\nLife.\nCamels live in groups, with one male, many females, and their young calves or calf. They are animals that use their hooves.\nReproduction.\nAn unborn camel gestates about 9 to 11 months. There is usually one calf per birth. A camel calf can run only a few hours after it is born. Calves are weaned to when they are about 1 year old.\nDiet.\nIn the desert, people feed camels with grass, grains, wheat and oats. When camels are travelling in the desert, food is often very hard to find. So the animal might have to live on dried leaves, seeds, and thorny twigs (without hurting their mouths). If there is not any regular food, camels will eat anything.\nDigestion.\nCamels are ruminants, which have a two-part cycle in their eating. The first stomach ferments the food for a time. Then, this food (or cud) returns to the camel's mouth, and the camel chews it again. Then the camel swallows the cud and it goes to the other parts of the stomach to be completely digested. The digestion is done mainly by microorganisms in the stomachs.\nThis adaptation means they can eat food which may not be very nutritious, but they get everything possible out of it. Ruminants are a very successful group of mammals, and this double-stomach arrangement is one of their key adaptations. Most of them eat fairly tough plant material.\nCamels and humans.\nCamels have been domesticated by humans for about 5000 years. They are used for riding and to carry things, and for meat, milk and wool.\nAs domesticated animals they are used in Africa, Asia, and since the 19th century also in Australia. About 900-1000 wild Bactrian Camels still live in China, Tibetan Plateau and Mongolia. There are no wild dromedaries anymore, but there are escaped domestic dromedaries in Australia. Today there are dromedaries living wild in the outback in Australia."}

They are used as medicine to treat and cure diseases caused by bacteria. The first antibiotic discovered was Penicillin, a natural antibiotic produced by a fungus. Production of antibiotics first began in 1939, and in the modern day, they are made by chemical synthesis. Antibiotics can not be used to treat viruses.\nResistance.\nToday, people worry that bacteria will not be affected by antibiotics. Bacteria do evolve, and already many strains of bacteria resist regular antibiotics. When exposed to antibiotics, most bacteria die quickly, but some may have mutations which make them slightly less susceptible. These bacteria then multiply and make a large colony which is less affected by the antibiotic.\nPart of this problem is caused by the over-use and misuse of antibiotics. If someone is sick with a virus, antibiotics will not affect the virus. Some doctors will still prescribe an antibiotic so the patient feels as though they are being treated for their illness.\nThe other problem is that many people do not use antibiotics correctly. People often stop taking the medicine when they start feeling better. But antibiotics don't kill all of the bad bacteria at once. Bacteria which are more resistant do not die right away. When someone stops taking the antibiotic too quickly, these resistant bacteria can reproduce and survive. Then the antibiotic does not work so well because the bacteria are less affected by it.\nHistory.\nAntibiotics can be the most effective way of treating bacterial infections. A clue to this might been found in Pasteur's work. He had a culture of anthrax germs that were left exposed to air. They developed colonies of many fungi, but the anthrax bacilli disappeared. Medical science was not, at the time, ready to see the implication of this.\nIt was 1928 that the study of antibiotics started,a small chance beginning. Alexander Fleming, a London bacteriologist, was culturing \"staphylococcus\". In one Petri dish a mould appeared and spread On the nutrient gelatin of the dish each patch of mould was surrounded by clear ring, free of bacteria. Moreover, the extracted substance was able to clear up infected wounds.\nThe term \"antibiotic\" was first used in 1942 by Selman Waksman and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is antagonistic to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution. This definition cut out substances which kill bacteria, but are not produced by microorganisms (such as gastric juices and hydrogen peroxide). It also excluded synthetic antibacterial compounds such as the sulfonamides.\nWith advances in medicinal chemistry, most of today's antibacterials chemically are modifications of various natural compounds.\nUse.\nCertain bacteria are only affected by specific types of antibiotics. Antibiotics fight infection caused by bacteria.Patients might need different types or different amounts of antibiotics depending on what bacteria is causing their health problems. Because of this, antibiotics should always be used under the supervision of a medical doctor (or other certified medical practitioner). The doctor can also watch for side effects and change the patient's treatment when necessary. Antibiotics are very useful when your body is infected by a bacteria.\nAntibiotics don't kill virus, so it is useless against a viral infection. A doctor must determine if a patient's infection is of viral or bacterial origin before taking antibiotics, this is another reason why a medical doctor should prescribe antibiotics instead of relying on self-medication.\nTeixobactin.\nTeixobactin is the first new antibiotic discovered in forty years. It is active against gram-positive bacteria, including \"Staphylococcus aureus\". It appears to be one of a new class of antibiotics."}

Sexism could affect a person attending a party, getting a job, joining a game, trying to get a promotion, being selected and so on.\nThe women's rights and men's rights movements both say they fight sexism.\nSexism is often discrimination against women due to the history of sexism in the western world.\nHatred of women is called misogyny.

It is called \"Wei-k'i\" (or Wei-chi) in Chinese, \"Patok\" or \"Baduk\" in Korean and \"I-go\" in Japanese.\nGo is played on a board with black and white game pieces called stones. Players take turns placing a stone of their color on intersections of a 19x19 square grid. The player with the black stones goes first. A normal Go board has 19 rows and columns of lines. Some players use 9x9 or 13x13 boards because smaller boards usually mean shorter, less complex games.\nA game of Go ends when both players pass their turns without playing. This usually happens when adding another stone to the board doesn't change the score. The winner is the player whose stones surround more empty intersections (points). To that is added captured stones and \"komi\". Komi are points added to the second player, which in this game is the white player. A game may also end when a player gives up and resigns.\nIn a game against a skilled player, a less skilled player may be given a \"handicap\" of extra stones on the board at the start of the game as well as playing black. These rules help make the game and final score fair for both players.\nRules.\nBesides the order of play (Black plays first, then White plays, then Black plays, and so on) and handicap or scoring rules, there are only two rules in Go:\nStones cannot be removed from the board except by the opponent surrounding it. A group of stones are all \"alive\" as long as one stone is next to an empty intersection. Stones with no liberties (no access to empty space) are captured and removed from the board. At the end of the game, the prisoners are usually deducted from the score of the player who lost them. \nThe second rule is called \"Ko\" (eternity). You can place stones on any clear intersection you want, as long it isn't taken off right after, or the board looks the same all over as it did before. This is to stop the game from going back and forth capturing the same stones forever. Players must make a move somewhere else on the board during a \"ko fight\" before they can re-capture a stone in the same position. \nIts original Chinese name is \"\" (= wei qi or wei chi). It is also popular in Japan, and its common name \"Go\" comes from Japanese. In Korea the game is called \"baduk\". In these three countries the game is an important part of the culture, like chess is in many western countries. \nGo and chess are both \"board games\" and games of strategy. They both have no luck or secret information, unlike some other classic games like backgammon (dice are rolled) or poker and other card games which also have secret information.\nThere are many places to play Go on the Internet, as well as local clubs and national organizations in many countries around the world. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation (IGF) found that there are over 20 million players around the world. Most players live in East Asia.\nHistory.\nGo was invented in China but the specific time is not known. Some say it was invented more than 2,500 years ago and is the oldest board game still played today. The historian of board games, H.J.R.

Donkeys ears are much longer than a horse's. The necks are straighter and the croup and rump are also a different shape. The back is straighter.\nThe mane and tail of the donkey are rough. The mane is still and upright, almost always standing up, and the tail is more like a cow's, most of it covered with short body hair. Because their mane sometimes fly away, many donkeys wear their manes clipped short or shaved close to the neck.\nHoof shapes are different as well, donkey hooves are smaller and rounder, with more upright pasterns. The legs should have good bone, but lots of donkeys have long thin legs with tiny feet. Larger donkeys may appear opposite, with big, heavy legs and large round feet. Good legs and feet are very important for mules that are trying to find a mate. This is because, for breeding, a good foot is more liked than a large body on small legs and feet.\nThe donkey's voice is a very raspy kind, and it makes a loud \"Ee - Aww\" noise, known as braying (hence Eeyore in the \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" books). Although most people think donkeys are a gray color, sometimes they can have stripes, dark ear marks, as well as the \"light points\". This means that it has a white muzzle and white rings around its eyes, and a white belly and inner leg.\nColors of the donkey may be from gray to brown. Or sometimes they can be black, both red and gray, creamy white, or a unique spotted pattern. Donkeys come in lots of different sizes. Some, like the rare French donkey, has huge heads and ears, and very thick, shaggy curled black coat.\nDonkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management. The height at the\u00a0withers\u00a0ranges from 7.3 to 15.3\u00a0hands\u00a0(31 to 63\u00a0inches, 79 to 160\u00a0cm), and the weight from 80 to 480\u00a0kg (180 to 1,060\u00a0lb). Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years;\nCaring for donkeys.\nGood grass hay and pasture is usually what donkeys enjoy to eat. If the hay or grass is grained, the protein is best to be lower than 12%. However, if a donkey is overfed, it will have a \"roll\" on the neck. A roll is when fat bunches up and stays in a part of a donkey's body, and they usually happen on its neck or its hip. If they develop on the donkey, it will usually stay for its whole life. If the neck roll of fat gets too heavy, it will fall or \"break over\" to one side and never recover its balance again. This is why donkeys should not be fed too much. Many people do not like to work with donkeys. They think that donkeys are too stubborn and will kick them. However, a donkey that is nicely trained can be as easily managed as other horses."}

K. Rowling and published on 16 July 2005. The book is the sixth Harry Potter book.\nIn the sixth book Harry begins his sixth year at the magical school Hogwarts with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. During the year he has help in his worst class by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince (also known as Severus snape), he has his first romance and learns several very important facts about his enemy, Voldemort.\nFilm.\nThe film, based on the book, was to be released on 21 November 2008, but on 14 August 2008, it was announced that the film would be pushed back to 17 July 2009. On 8 January 2009, the film was given a PG rating by the MPPA. The previous two installments, \"Goblet of Fire\" and \"Order of the Phoenix,\" were rated PG-13.\nPlot.\nThe book starts at Severus Snape's house. Narcissa Malfoy is very unhappy that Voldemort has made her son, Draco, put on a mission. Voldemort is a very bad man who does not like half-blood or Muggle (non-magical) wizards and witches. He wants to kill them. Bellatrix, Narcissa's sister, and Narcissa go to Snape's house. There, Snape agrees and says he will help Malfoy complete whatever his mission is.\nHeadmaster Albus Dumbledore comes by Harry Potter's place to ask him to come with him. Harry says okay. They go to Horace Slughorn's house. Slughorn was the former professor of Potions over at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He does not want to come back, but when Dumbledore shows Harry, he says okay. On the train to Hogwarts, Slughorn gets together his club again. Slughorn likes to take a back seat and has a lot of influence, or power. Harry is one of the most famous wizards ever and Slughorn wants to be his friend. When school starts, the first thing Slughorn does is recreate his old Slug Club, filled with people who have power or a good name.\nThe Half-Blood Prince is of great mystery to Harry. Harry finds a book with the Prince's name on it and finds that it has many helpful tips for making potions. He follows the tips and is seen as very smart to Professor Slughorn. His friend Hermione is mad that Harry is getting credit for information that he does not really know. The old professor, Professor Snape, is now teaching Defense of the Dark Arts.\nDumbledore gives private lessons to Harry. They usually involve looking into a Pensieve, which holds old memories. In flashback, Harry learns that Voldemort was the product of an unhappy witch and a Muggle father that never loved him. The witch was named Merope and she had an older brother and father that were very bad to her. They made her work and crushed her spirit. A Ministry of Magic wizard came and arrested the father and brother. Merope left the house and gave a love potion to a young man she liked named Tom Riddle.\nAfter she was pregnant with the baby, she stopped giving him the potion and he left her. Soon afterwards, she goes to an orphanage and gives birth to Voldemort, naming him Tom Marvolo Riddle, and dies shortly afterwards. Voldemort is a very bad kid. He steals items from the other kids and uses magic against them. Dumbledore comes one night to tell him that he has magic and invites him to attend Hogwarts.\nOne final memory shows Voldemort trying to apply for a job at Hogwarts. Dumbledore, who was the Transfiguration teacher at the time, was just made Headmaster. Voldemort wanted to be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Dumbledore refused to make him a teacher. This angered Voldemort. Since then, no professor has held the Defense Against the Dark Arts job for more than a year and Dumbledore thinks it is because of this meeting.\nDumbledore tells Harry that Voldemort has six \"Horcruxes,\" or pieces of his soul. While Voldemort has these Horcruxes, nobody can kill him. A couple of them have been destroyed. In Harry's second year, he stabbed Riddle's diary with a fang, destroying one. Before Harry's sixth year started, Dumbledore visited the old Marvolo home and found a ring and destroyed it but lost his hand as a result.\nOne night, Dumbledore and Harry go out to a cave area. Dumbledore thinks there is another Horcrux there. After getting there, they find a goblet. Dumbledore drinks the entire potion, which makes him dizzy. They find the locket and go back to Hogwarts, where they find that the Death Eaters and Malfoy have attacked. They take broomsticks and land at the top of one of the towers. Malfoy bursts where Harry and Dumbledore are. Harry is hiding under an invisibility cloak. Soon, other Death Eaters come up, but Malfoy cannot kill Dumbledore as Voldemort ordered him to do. Snape comes up and kills Dumbledore.\nThe Death Eaters all escape afterwards. Harry tries to get Snape, but Snape is too fast. When Harry tries to use some curses he found in the Half-Blood Prince's book, Snape fights back and then declares that he is the Half-Blood Prince. Later, Hermione says this is true, having found a newspaper article about a girl named Eileen Prince (a witch) marrying a man named Tobias Snape (a Muggle), making Snape a half-blood wizard.\nHogwarts holds a funeral for Dumbledore. Harry opens the locket, only to find that someone named R.A.B was there earlier and found and destroyed the Horcrux. He also says he will not be coming back to Hogwarts next year."}

It is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It is also spoken by many people in Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and other neighbouring countries and by immigrants from Central Asia in Russia. Persian was also taught as a second language in schools in Pakistan until 2006. In the past, many of those places were parts of the Persian Empire.\nPersian has many dialects and is officially called Farsi in Iran, Dari and Farsi in Afghanistan and Tajiki in Tajikistan. The literary language of each country is a little different, but people from each country can understand one another when they have a conversation. It has words from French in Iran and many from Russian Tajikistan.\nAlphabet.\nThe Persian alphabet has the following letters:\n\u0627\u00a0\u0628\u00a0\u067e\u00a0\u062a\u00a0\u062b\u00a0\u062c\u00a0\u0686\u00a0\u062d\u00a0\u062e\u00a0\u062f\u00a0\u0630\u00a0\u0631\u00a0\u0632\u00a0\u0698\u00a0\u0633\u00a0\u0634\u00a0\u0635\u00a0\u0636\u00a0\u0637\u00a0\u0638\u00a0\u0639\u00a0\u063a\u00a0\u0641\u00a0\u0642\u00a0\u06a9\u00a0\u06af\u00a0\u0644\u00a0\u0645\u00a0\u0646\u00a0\u0648\u00a0\u0647\u00a0\u06cc\nThe Persian alphabet used in Iran and Afghanistan is similar to the Arabic alphabet, but since Persian in a different family from Arabic, their vocabulary and grammar are very different. Since the 1930s, in the countries that were in the Soviet Union, like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, Persian has been written in the Cyrillic alphabet, like Russian. All Persian-speakers used to use the Arabic alphabet.\nHistory.\nPersian is a very old language, and linguists use names for three different versions of Persian that were used in three different times. Old Persian was spoken in the first Persian Empire, under the Achaemenid kings, including Cyrus and Darius the Great. The empire existed from the 6th century BC to the conquest of Alexander the Great. The second Persian empire was ruled by the Sassanian kings from the 2nd century AD until the Muslim conquest of Iran by the Arabs in the 7th century and spoke Middle Persian, or Pahlavi.\nNew or Modern Persian is spoken today and was first written down in the 9th century, during the Samanid Empire, which was the first Muslim Persian kingdom and was based in Central Asia. The earliest writers of New Persian included poets like Rudaki, and Ferdowsi, who wrote an epic, a very long poem, called the \"Shahname\", translated as the \"Book of Kings\" in English. It has myths and historical stories from before the Arabs conquered Persia.\nMany other famous writers in Persian language were poets too, a few being Saadi, Hafez, Rumi. The Persian language has been very important one for literature. After Arabic, it was the second most common written language in Muslim countries, especially in the East."}

The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo. The government is based in Cotonou, the country's largest city. Most people live on the small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin.\nBecause Benin was colonized by France and is still close to it, the official language of Benin is French. Languages such as Fon and Yoruba are commonly spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is Roman Catholicism. This is followed closely by Islam, Vodun, and Protestantism.\nBenin is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, La Francophonie, the Community of Sahel-Saharan States, the African Petroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority.\nFrom the 17th to the 19th century, Benin was ruled by the Kingdom of Dahomey. It was called the Slave Coast by white people from as early as the 17th century, because of the large number of slaves shipped from Porto-Novo, Cotonou, and other ports to European colonies in the Americas.\nAfter slavery was made illegal, France fought a war against Dahomey and took over the kingdom. They renamed it French Dahomey. In 1960, Dahomey gained official independence from France. From 1972 to 1990 a Marxist\u2013Leninist state called the People's Republic of Benin existed. The current Republic of Benin was formed in 1991.\nGeography.\nBenin is a narrow country in west Africa. The country measures about at its widest point.

Its capital, and largest city, is Santo Domingo. The national language is Spanish.\nThe country was part of the Spanish empire until the late 18th century. In the 19th century France, Spain and Haiti controlled it at various times, and later it was independent. It was occupied by the United States from 1916 to 1924. The Dominican Republic is a presidential democratic republic. The country has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the \"trade winds\" (winds that come from the northeast, from the Atlantic Ocean).\nThe Spanish brought African slaves to the country.\nDominican Republic is one of the biggest producers of cacao.\nHistory.\nThe island of Hispaniola was discovered by Christopher Columbus on December 5th, 1492, but the first time that he saw part of the present Dominican Republic was on January 4th, 1493 when he saw a headland that he named \"Monte Cristi\" (\"Mountain of Christ\"). That mountain is called now \"El Morro\" and is near the city of Monte Cristi.\nFrom Monte Cristi, Columbus went east along the north coast of the island and on 6 January, after visiting the Saman\u00e1 Bay, he went back to Spain. In his second trip to America, he founded the first European city in the continent, \"La Isabela\", near the present city of Puerto Plata.\nLater, Bartholomew Columbus founded the city of Santo Domingo, the oldest permanent European city in the Americas. From here, many Spaniards went to conquer other islands (Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico). Because Cuba was closer to the continent, many people moved there from Hispaniola, and then to the continent. Because of that, the population of the island grew very slowly. By the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, Spain gave the western third of the island to France and kept the eastern part, and so the island had two different colonies: the French \"Saint-Domingue\" and the Spanish \"Santo Domingo\". In 1795, France got the whole island but they could only control the eastern part because Haiti became independent very soon. In 1809, the French government gave back the old colony of \"Santo Domingo\" to Spain.\nOn 1 December 1821, the Spanish lieutenant governor Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres declared the independence from Spain. The new country had the name \"Estado Independiente del Hait\u00ed Espa\u00f1ol\" (\"Independent State of Spanish Haiti\"). But on 9 February 1822, the Haitian army occupied the country and stayed for 22 years. Juan Pablo Duarte founded a secret society, \"La Trinitaria\", to fight for the Dominican independence. The Haitian occupation ended on 27 February 1844, when the inhabitants of the eastern part of the Hispaniola made a new country named \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\" (\"Dominican Republic\"). From 1861 to 1865, the country was again a Spanish colony. On 16 August 1863 began the \"Restoration War\" when the Dominicans fought to be free again. That war ended in 1865 when the Spanish left and the Dominican Republic was again an independent country.\nThe country was occupied by the United States from 1916 to 1924. In 1930, Rafael Trujillo became the president of the country through a coup d'\u00e9tat. Trujillo was a cruel dictator, killing thousands of people, among them many Haitians. Trujillo was killed in 1961. After the death of Trujillo, Juan Bosch was elected in 1962 and became, in 1963, the first elected president since 1930. But was Bosch was in power for only seven months. In 1965, there was a civil war between those that wanted Bosch back on power and those that were opposed to him. Then the country was invaded again by the United States.\nSince the end of the civil war, the presidents of the Dominican Republic have been:\nGovernment.\nThe Dominican Republic is a presidential democratic republic. The government is divided in three branches: the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary. The Executive branch is made up of the President, the Vice President and the Ministers who are called \"Secretaries of State\". The President is chief of state and head of government and is elected every 4 years. He nominates the cabinet. The current president is Danilo Medina S\u00e1nchez.\nThe Legislative branch makes the laws and is made up of the Congress, which is in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. The Congress is divided into two groups: the Senate, with 32 members (one for every province and one for the National District), and the Chamber of Deputies with 178 members.\nThe Judicial branch is made up of the courts of the country, including the Supreme Court of Justice.\nPolitics.\nThe Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy ruled by a president. The president is elected every 4 years. The current president is Danilo Medina S\u00e1nchez, of the PLD.\nThere are 3 important political parties in the Dominican Republic:\nThe land.\nThere are several mountain chains in the Dominican Republic.

There are many lakes; the largest is the \"Lake Enriquillo\", in the \"Hoya de Enriquillo\".\nThe country has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the \"trade winds\" (winds that come from the northeast, from the Atlantic Ocean). At sea level, the average temperature is 25\u00b0C, with small changes from one season to another. In the highest mountains, the temperature in winter can be as low as 0\u00b0C.\nThere are two wet seasons: April-June and September-November. The most dry period is from December to March. Rainfall varies greatly; eastern regions, like the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula, get an average of over 2,000\u00a0mm in a year, but less than 500\u00a0mm fall in the southwest (Hoya de Enriquillo).\nFrom June to November, hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the island.\nPeople.\nThe Dominican Republic has a total population, estimated for July 2009, of 9,650,054 inhabitants, for a density of 236.30 inhabitants per km\u00b2.\nAbout 64% of Dominicans live in cities and towns and 87% of people that are 15 years old or more can read and write.\nThe two largest cities are Santo Domingo (the capital city) with 1,817,754 inhabitants, and Santiago, in the Cibao Valley and with 908,250 inhabitants.\nThe ethnic composition of Dominicans is around 85% Mulatto &amp; Black, 14% White and 1% Asian. \nProvinces.\nThe Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces. The national capital Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n is in the \"Distrito National\" that is like a province and elects one Senator.\nThe provinces are:\nEconomy.\nThe Dominican Republic has a mixed economy based mainly on agriculture, services (including tourism and finance), trade and money sent from the many Dominicans that live in other countries (United States, Europe). Agricultural production (mainly sugarcane, with smaller amounts of coffee, cacao, and tobacco) was the main economic activity but now is in third place after tourism and manufacturing in \"zonas francas\" (\"free zones\" where the industries do not pay taxes and all the production is sent to other countries).\nMining is also important, mainly ferronickel (nickel with iron) and gold.\nThe Dominican Republic suffers from poverty, with 83.3% of the population living below the poverty line in 2012. The wealth distribution is uneven: the richest 10% gets nearly 40% of national income.\nCulture.\nThe culture of the Dominican Republic, like in other Caribbean countries, is a mix of Ta\u00edno, African and European (mainly Spanish) cultures.\nThere are not many Ta\u00edno traditions in the modern Dominican culture; many places keep their Ta\u00edno names: Dajab\u00f3n, B\u00e1nica, Haina, Yaque, Saman\u00e1, etc. Also many objects, plants and animals have a Ta\u00edno origin and their names have been included in other languages; for example: \"canoa\" (canoe, a small boat), \"hamaca\" (hammock, a simple bed), \"ma\u00edz\" (maize, corn), \"yuca\" (cassava, that comes from the Ta\u00edno word \"casabe\", a kind of cassava bread eaten in the Caribbean), and \"batata\" (sweet potato).\nThat mix of different traditions created a culture that is known as Creole (in Spanish: \"Criolla\"), common to all countries in the Caribbean, Louisiana and some parts of South America and Central America.\nLanguages.\nIn the Dominican Republic, only Spanish is spoken, however; there are 3 major languages that are also spoken such as Haitian Creole, Samana English, and the West African Yoruba language known as Lucumi spoken by few. There is a local dialect or patois which is spoken by all Dominicans - see Dominican Spanish Creole. In the Chinese Dominican comunnity (composed around 60 000 people) elder generations keep talking in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese.\nReligions.\nThe official religion is Roman Catholicism but there is freedom of religion. Protestant groups are important, representing about 15% of the total population. Each year major festivities called \"fiestas patronales\" are held. They are Catholic festivities in honor of the Patron saints of the towns and villages; it is a Spanish tradition to associate every town with a Catholic saint. The festivities includes church services, street parades, fire works, dance contests and other activities. Dominican Voodoo or Santeria is also practiced in large numbers as well as Dominican Palo, Dominican Kongo religion, and others.\nAfrican culture has the strongest influence in Dominican culture, especially in language, religion, food, and music.\nNational holidays.\n\"Notes\":"}

{"id": "15652", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15652", "title": "Navassa Island", "text": "Navassa Island, or La Navase in Haitian Creole, is a small island without anyone living on it in the Caribbean Sea. It is located ninety miles south of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The United States government claims the two-square-mile island as a territory of the United States, and it is under control of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The island is also claimed by Haiti.\nSome sailors sailing with Christopher Columbus named Navassa in 1504, because no fresh water could be found there.\nA captain named Peter Duncan gave it to the U.S. in the late 1850s, for the purpose of guano mining. After a rebellion in 1889, and the Spanish-American War of 1898, the mining was put to an end.\nWith the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, Navassa became important again, because of a lighthouse being built there. After World War II, no one lived on it again.\nIn 1996, Navassa's light was put out of use, and the island was transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior. Three years later in 1999, the Fish and Wildlife Service received ownership of the island.\nHistory.\nNavassa became a U.S. insular area in October 1857, when a representative of the Baltimore Fertilizer Company took possession of the island in the name of the United States pursuant to the Guano Act of August 18, 1856 (Title 48, U.S. Code, sections 1411-19). In 1889 the island's actual operation passed to the Navassa Phosphate Company. All operations were abandoned in 1898, when the island became effectively uninhabited.\nGeography.\nNavassa Island is three square miles in area. Navassa lies about one hundred miles south of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, about thirty miles west of Cape Tiburon, Haiti, at the southwest entrance to the Windward Passage, east of Kingston, Jamaica. Navassa's climate is marine and tropical.\nIts terrain is a raised coral and limestone plateau, flat to undulating, ringed by vertical white cliffs, approximately nine to fifteen yards high. Navassa's environment is mostly exposed rock. However, it has enough grassland to support goat herds. Dense stands of fig-like trees and scattered cactus also exist. Only one tenth of the island's land is meadows or pastures. Navassa has no ports and only off-shore anchorage.\nPolitical status.\nIn 1976, the U.S. Coast Guard determined that the lighthouse on Navassa was no longer of any value to the U.S. Government and was ceasing its exercise of any interest in the island. However, the U.S. Coast Guard's ceasing to administer Navassa's use did not have any bearing at all on the United States sovereignty over the island, which remained constant regardless of the administering Federal agency or office. Consequently, under the provisions of Title 43, U.S.Code, section 1458, the Department of the Interior assumed responsibility for the civil administration of the U.S. insular area.\nActing under the authority that the Secretary of the Interior delegated to him in Secretary's Order No. 3205 (January 16, 1997) and Amendment No. 1 (January 14, 1998) to Secretary's Order No. 3205 and in fulfillment of his responsibilities as the civil administrator of the United States insular area of Navassa Island, the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs advises all persons interested in visiting Navassa Island that, having made a preliminary review of the island's ecology, he has decided indefinitely not to allow visits to the island and its surrounding waters until he has received a further assessment of the island's environment and conservation status. As used in this notice, the term \"surrounding waters\" includes the waters surrounding Navassa Island seaward to a line twelve (12) nautical miles distant from Navassa Island's coastlines. The Director of the Office of Insular Affairs intends that nothing in this notice shall deny or impair the right of innocent passage in the waters surrounding Navassa Island.\nOn September 2, 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established the Navassa Island Wildlife Refuge as an overlay. As of December 3, 1999, the Office of Insular Affairs ceased to have any administrative responsibility for Navassa. A Secretary's order of that date transferred full administration of Navassa from the Office of Insular Affairs to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service."}

{"id": "15662", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15662", "title": "Blink-182", "text": "Blink-182 is a popular California pop punk band formed in 1992. Currently, the band members are Mark Hoppus (bass, vocals), Travis Barker (drums), and Matt Skiba (guitar, vocals). The band was originally created by Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, and Scott Raynor. They quickly became popular for their exciting concerts and immature humour.\nThe band played lots of concerts after releasing their first album \"Cheshire Cat\" in 1995. The band signed with MCA Records to distribute its second album, \"Dude Ranch\", in 1997. In 1998, the band got rid of Scott Raynor and replaced him with drummer Travis Barker. The band's next two albums, \"Enema of the State\" (1999) and \"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\" (2001), were very popular and successful both on the radio and on MTV. For their fifth album, \"Blink-182\" (2003), the band changed their musical style. After DeLonge quit the band in 2005, Hoppus and Barker suspended the band. The members of the band came together again in 2009 to create their sixth album, \"Neighborhoods\", which was released in 2011. In 2015, DeLonge quit the band again and was replaced by Matt Skiba of the band, Alkaline Trio. The band's seventh album, \"California\", was released on July 1, 2016.\nBlink-182 is considered to be very important to the development of pop punk. The band's combination of pop music melodies with fast-paced punk rock made them popular on the radio. The band has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States, and over 50 million albums around the world. In 2011, \"The New York Times\" wrote that, \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182.\"\nHistory.\nTom DeLonge, who played guitar, had been friends with Ann Hoppus while living in San Diego. He had often complained about wanting to start a band. Ann then introduced Tom to her younger brother, Mark Hoppus, who played bass. They later found drummer Scott Raynor to complete the band. The original name the band chose was blink. After an Irish techno band that had the same name threatened to sue them, they added on the \"182\". Fans still refer the band as simply \"Blink\". \nIn 1998, midway through a North American tour, Raynor left the band to continue his education. It was also rumoured that Raynor was forced to leave the band due to his drinking problem. Travis Barker, who had been drumming for The Aquabats at the time, played drums for Blink for the rest of the tour. Tom and Mark were so impressed that they had Barker become the band's full-time drummer. \nIn February 2005, the band announced that they were going to take a break for a while. DeLonge went on to create the band Angels &amp; Airwaves, while Hoppus and Barker created the band +44.\nDuring the 2009 Grammy Awards, the members of Blink-182 said that the band would be getting back together.\nIn 2016, Matt Skiba from Alkaline Trio joined the band to take DeLonge's place. They released a new album, \"California\", in 2016.\nMusic.\nDemos:\nAlbums Released:\nThey also made a \"Greatest Hits\" album in 2005. That album contained two songs that had not been released in the United States before, \"Not Now\" and \"Another Girl Another Planet\". \"Another Girl Another Planet\" was a cover song; it was first sung by The Only Ones."}

{"id": "15666", "revid": "7878232", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15666", "title": "Doctor Who", "text": "Doctor Who is a BBC science fiction television series. The series is about an alien time-traveller known as \"the Doctor\". In her space-time ship, the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space), the Doctor and her companions travel through space and time.\nThe television series ran from 1963\u20131989 and started running again in 2005. It is the longest running science fiction television series in the world.\nThere were two \"Doctor Who\" movies made in the 1960s. Peter Cushing played the Doctor in these movies, but he was not the Doctor in the television series. In 1996, there was also a television movie starring Paul McGann. There have been many other versions of \"Doctor Who\" in books, comics, games, other shows, music videos, remixes, fan fiction, documentaries, the news, in magazines, toys, cosplay, decorations, on the internet, on radios, on DVDs, on Bluray, On other disc formats and other forms of entertainment.\nStory outline.\nThe story is about a person who calls themselves \"The Doctor\". They travel in their space-time-ship TARDIS (\"Time And Relative Dimension In Space\"), with which he can go anywhere in time and space. Because of an error in its \"chameleon circuit\", the outside of the TARDIS always looks like a 1960s-style British police public call box (similar to a blue telephone box), but on the inside the TARDIS is much bigger.\nThe Doctor is an alien, a \"Time Lord\" from the planet Gallifrey. At first, they travelled only with their granddaughter Susan Foreman. Later, the Doctor took other people with them. They are usually called \"companions\" or \"assistants\". The Doctor and their companions travel through space and time, have a lot of adventures, and often save many people.\nSome people think that the Doctor's name is not actually \"Doctor Who\", but other people think there is no mistake. The character was named Doctor Who in the titles until the Fifth Doctor, and after the 2005 restart the Ninth Doctor, played by Christopher Eccleston, is called Doctor Who in the titles too. The Second Doctor once signed a letter as \"Dr W.\".\nHistory.\n\"Doctor Who\" was first shown in 1963, with William Hartnell as the Doctor. When Hartnell left the show in 1966, the writers came up with the idea that the Doctor would \"regenerate\" (at the time called \"renewal\") and transform into the Second Doctor, who was played by Patrick Troughton. In 1970, when Jon Pertwee took over as the Third Doctor, the series switched from black-and-white to colour.\nBefore 1978, the BBC would sometimes throw away episodes they did not need. This was because they did not usually show episodes on television more than once, and they needed to reuse video tape to record new broadcasts. Some of the episodes that were thrown away have been found since then, but 97 of the 851 episodes are still missing. However, audio recordings of all missing episodes exist, and some of these have been released on home video with animations.\nSeven actors played the Doctor from 1963 until 1989, when the series stopped. In 1996, the BBC teamed with Fox Broadcasting Company and Universal Pictures to create a film version, in which Paul McGann played the Eighth Doctor. It was hoped that the film would lead to a new series, but this did not happen.\nInstead, the series started again in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor. He was replaced by David Tennant at the end of the series. The actor who now plays the Doctor is Jodie Whittaker, who joined the show in the 2017 Christmas episode.\nIn the \"Guinness World Records\", \"Doctor Who\" is listed as the longest running science fiction television series in the world. In 2013, it celebrated its 50th birthday with a special episode.\nThe Doctor.\nThe Doctor is the central character of \"Doctor Who\". They are an alien, a \"Time Lord\" from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor often takes other people with them, who are usually called \"companions\", \"assistants\" or \"friends\" (or, due to a misunderstanding, \"partners\"). They are most often human. The current companions are Yasmin Khan (as played by Mandip Gill), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole) and Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh).\nAs a Gallifreyan, the Doctor looks human on the surface. However, there are differences. For example, they have two hearts. Also, if badly injured or dying, they can \"regenerate\". During the \"regeneration\", their body heals and renews itself. Then, they take on a different appearance and personality. They are the same person (sort of) with the same memories and knowledge. But, they look different and has a new personality. Because of this, the Doctor can be played by different actors. And in over fifty years, this is why the character has not actually \"changed\".\nIncarnations and actors of the Doctor.\nUp until now, the Doctor has regenerated fourteen times, and each \"incarnation\" was played by a different actor (except for the Tenth Doctor, who used up two regenerations by channeling excess regeneration energy after healing to his old hand that had been chopped of in The Christmas Invasion). (Numbers refer to incarnations that used up regenerations).\nThe Doctor has been played by other actors in other media: theatre plays, parodies, etc. These are not officially part of the \"Doctor Who\" story.\nThe movies \"Dr. Who &amp; the Daleks\" and \"Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.\" star Peter Cushing as a human scientist named \"Doctor Who\". Shortly after it was announced that the series would return from its nineties hiatus, Richard E. Grant voiced The Doctor in an animated serial. The BBC issued press releases identifying Grant as the \"ninth Doctor\" but this was later disregarded by the revived BBC television series.\nSometimes different incarnations of the Doctor meet each other. Usually episodes with several Doctors are made when the program celebrates an anniversary. In 1973, when the show was 10 years old, the episode \"The Three Doctors\" was shown. It had the first three Doctors.\nIn 1983, there was the 20th anniversary special. \"The Five Doctors\". Patrick Troughton, John Pertwee, Peter Davison and Richard Hurndall (replacing William Hartnell) played The Doctor. Tom Baker refused to play in it, so they used the old footage of the incomplete \"Shada\" episode to show him.\nIn 1985, there was the episode \"The Two Doctors\", with the Second and the Sixth Doctors.\nThe fifth Doctor met the tenth incarnation in mini-episode named \"Time Crash\". It was aired in 2007.\nThe Tenth, Eleventh, and War Doctors met each other in the 50th anniversary special on November 23, 2013. That was the first time the War Doctor was seen. That special had short appearances by all the other Doctors with the use of old, recycled footage. It also had a mysterious version of the Doctor from the far off future played by Tom Baker. The Eighth Doctor also made a return in 2013 for a 50th anniversary special mini-episode.\nOn August 4, 2013, Peter Capaldi was revealed as the actor who would play the Twelfth Doctor.\nThe 12th doctor Peter Capaldi met the 1st doctor just before each doctor's regeneration in the last episode of Capaldi's series.\nOn July 16, 2017, it was revealed that Jodie Whittaker would replace Capaldi as the Doctor. She is the first female Doctor.\nIn the 2020 episode \"Fugitive of the Judoon\", Jo Martin was introduced in a surprise twist as the Fugitive Doctor. She is the first black actor to play the Doctor. It is suggested that the Fugitive Doctor is from the Thirteenth Doctor's past.\nAnother episode from the same year, \"The Timeless Children\", revealed that there were many incarnations of the Doctor before William Hartnell. The Thirteenth Doctor had forgotten them because the Time Lords had erased her memory.\nTARDIS.\nThe TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension In Space) is the Doctor's time machine. It can travel to any point in time and space, but the Doctor can never fully control it. The Doctor explains that TARDISes are not built, but they are grown like plants. The TARDIS is alive and has a mind of its own. In the episode \"The Doctor's Wife\" when the Doctor is able to communicate directly with its mind, the TARDIS explains that it did not always take him where he wanted to go but that \"I always took you where you needed to go.\"\nThe TARDIS is bigger on the inside than the outside, which is commented on by almost everyone who enters. On the inside, the TARDIS looks like a giant spaceship, but on the outside it looks like a police telephone box. These telephone boxes were still a common sight in many British cities when the series first began in 1963, but after the walkie-talkie was invented they were no longer needed. They were used by the police as workstations - and people could also use them to call the police.\nThe Doctor stole the TARDIS from a Time Lord museum when he began his travels. It was described as being a rather old \"Type 40\" model, whereas the best version is the \"Type 70\" used by the upper class Time Lords. The TARDIS has a device called the \"chameleon circuit\" which is supposed to change its shape on the outside to allow it to disguise it. In the very first story, this device stopped working and left the TARDIS stuck in the shape of a police box.\nThe farthest the Doctor has ever travelled in the TARDIS is to the Big Bang (the beginning of the Universe) and 100 trillion years into the future (the end of the Universe) (in the episode \"Utopia\"). The inside of the TARDIS is much bigger than its outside (it is \"dimensionally transcendental\"). It has a lot of different rooms. The most important of which is the \"console room\" where the Doctor pilots the TARDIS.\nCompanions.\nThe Doctor usually takes other people with them, who are usually called \"companions\" or \"assistants\". The Doctor and their companions travel through space and time, have a lot of adventures, and often save many people. The character of the companion was there so that the people watching the series could identify and feel close to a character. The companions were often present-time humans, so people could feel close to them, and they knew as much as the viewers. Because of this, the Doctor could explain things to their companions, and at the same time to the viewers. Almost all the Doctor's companions have been human, or human-looking aliens. Two companions were robots.\nSpecies.\nThe forces for evil.\nOverview: The BBC's link to a visual summary of Dr Who's opponents: \nThe Master.\nThe Master is a renegade Time Lord. He is the Doctor's nemesis. He was conceived as \"Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes\". The character first appeared in 1971, played by Roger Delgado. He continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over. He continued to play the character until Doctor Who's \"hiatus\" in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of \"Doctor Who\", played by Gordon Tipple in the ultimately unused pre-credits voiceover, then Eric Roberts. The Master was in the three-part finale of the 2007 series, portrayed by Derek Jacobi. He regenerated into John Simm at the end of the episode \"Utopia\". Simm next appeared in the last (and two-part) episode of the Tenth Doctor in 2009/2010. He then regenerated off-screen into a \"Time Lady\" (Michelle Gomez), who returned for the Twelfth Doctor's first series in 2014.\nDaleks.\nThe Daleks are one of the most powerful races in the Doctor Who history. They are the Doctor's worst enemies. They are alien mutants that live inside metal machines that look like pepper pots. Each Dalek casing has an eyesalk, a gunstick and a sucker arm that looks like a plunger. Daleks believe that they should conquer the universe and \"exterminate\" all other lifeforms that they believe are lesser than them. They can not be easily hurt by guns because their casing reflects or destroys the bullets. They were created on the planet Skaro by an evil scientist named Davros.\nThe Daleks first appeared in the very first season of Doctor Who, in a serial called \"The Daleks\" shown between 1963 and 1964. They most recently appeared in the episode \"Revolution of the Daleks\" in 2021.\nCybermen.\nCybermen are another enemy of the Doctor. They are one of their worst enemies. In the original series, they come from the planet Mondas. In the new series, some of them come from a parallel universe. Cybermen travel across the universe taking people and turning them into machines. They stomp around saying \"DELETE!\". They kill by electrocution. They are partially vulnerable to the metal gold, and can be killed by gold bullets. They change their look over time, but stay recognizable by \"handlebars\" on their heads, and tear drops in their eyes.\nThe Doctor has faced them many times. The first was in \"The Tenth Planet\" (William Hartnell's last episode). A more recent episode was \"World Enough and Time/The Doctor Falls\" (the last two episodes of Peter Capaldi's last season).\nSontarans.\nThe Sontarans are a group of aliens, bred in clone batches, that believe in war over anything else. They must face their enemy in combat because of their weak spot on the back of their neck, the probic vent. They have been said to look like baked potatoes.\nThe Doctor first met them in \"The Time Warrior\" (Jon Pertwee). They have been on the show and its spinoffs repeatedly.\nEarth reptiles.\nThe Sea Devils and the Silurians lived in the time of the dinosaurs until the catastrophe of the Moon's approach drove them into hibernation. They slept longer than planned and emerged late in the 20th century. The human scientist who discovered the Silurians estimated their era incorrectly. A later \"Doctor Who\" story said that they should have been classified as the Eocenes. A second species of hibernating Earth reptiles lived primarily underwater. They were labeled \"sea devils\" by a frightened, superstitious construction worker who encountered them.\nIce Warriors.\nThe Ice Warriors are a species of war-like alien who come from the planet Mars. They are human-like green reptiles who can only live in cold climates. The Doctor had to stop them from invading the planet Earth when their home planet became too hot for them to live in. However, they later became a more peaceful species when they joined a group of planets called the Galactic Federation. Other planets in the Federation include Earth and Peladon.\nWeeping Angels.\nThe Weeping Angels are creatures who have existed since the beginning of the universe. Most of them look like stone statues of angels. They can send people back in time by touching them, which they use to feed off energy. They cannot move if someone is looking at them, unless that person looks away or blinks. Anything that looks like an angel can become a Weeping Angel, such as video footage of a Weeping Angel or even the Statue of Liberty.\nThe forces for good.\nTime Lords.\nThe Time Lords are the alien race which the Doctor belongs to. They have two hearts. They can avoid dying by \"regeneration\" (transforming their bodies). The Time Lords were in some episodes in the classic series. Sometimes they were allies of the Doctor (at one point he became their president). Other times they were enemies. The Time Lords came from the planet Gallifrey.\nWhen the series returned in 2005, the Time Lords had disappeared in the \"Time War\". This was a very big war with the Daleks. The Doctor explained that he stopped the war by destroying Gallifrey, killing all of the Time Lords and Daleks. He believed he was the last of the Time Lords, until he discovered that the Master had also survived. Jenny, who was created artificially in \"The Doctor's Daughter,\" is not a true Time Lord. For many years, the Doctor felt sorry for destroying Gallifrey. In the 2013 episode \"The Day of the Doctor\", the Doctor learns that he did not actually destroy his planet, but that he had moved it to another universe.\nRegeneration.\nAs of 2018, the Doctor has been played by fourteen actors. They are William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, John Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, John Hurt, Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker.\nWhen Time Lords are dying, they \"regenerate.\" This causes a Time Lord's body to completely change, healing itself at the same time. Each time this happens, Time Lords have a different appearance and a different personality. Even with such big changes, Time Lords do not become different people, and will keep their memories each time they \"regenerate.\" This periodic change makes them live a very long time.\nA Time Lord is believed to only be able to regenerate 12 times. This means that Time Lords can have a total of 13 different incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. The episode \"The Time of the Doctor\" depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set.\nA criminal incarnation of the Doctor was somehow spawned between his 12th and final lives - the 'Valeyard'. It tried to sacrifice the sixth Doctor so that he could obtain more \"regenerations,\" allowing himself to live even longer.\nThe Master was already in his 13th life when he was introduced to the series. His 14th and 15th (and possibly later) incarnations were obtained by taking over the bodies of innocent victims. When the character returned to the show in 2007, the Master was in his 16th (or later) incarnation. Soon, he regenerates into his (~)17th incarnation. Later, he explains that the Time Lords resurrected him to be a great soldier when the Time Lords were fighting the Daleks in the Time War. It is likely that, having been resurrected, he had 12 more regenerations available to him.\nA Time Lord can choose not to regenerate. It appears that the process happens all on its own when a Time Lord is dying. But, it can be stopped if the Time Lord does not want to regenerate. This was seen when the (~)17th incarnation of the Master chose to die from a gunshot wound instead of living on as a prisoner in the Doctor's TARDIS.\nA Time Lord's body makes a huge amount of energy when regenerating. There is so much of this \"regeneration energy\" that a Time Lord can regrow a body part that gets removed, as long as it happens soon enough after regenerating. When the Doctor regenerated into his 10th incarnation, his hand was cut off in a sword fight. Because it had been less than 15 hours since he had regenerated into this incarnation, he was able to quickly grow a new hand.\nIf a Time Lord has kept a part of his or her body that had been removed (like the 10th Doctor's hand, from before), it can be used to keep a Time Lord from changing during regeneration. The 10th incarnation of the Doctor kept the hand that was cut off in the sword fight in a jar on board the TARDIS. Eventually, he was shot by a Dalek, and his body began the regeneration process. After his body had finished healing, but before his body could change into a new one, the Doctor sent all of the extra energy into the hand in the jar."}

Usually, those people belong to groups the government does not like. The term means to confine (keep in a secure manner) \"enemy citizens in wartime or terrorism suspects\".\nSome governments put people in concentration camps because they belong to a certain religion, race, or ethnic group.\nUsually, people are sent to concentration camps without having had a trial or being found guilty of a crime.\nSometimes, governments send people to concentration camps to do forced labor or to be killed. For example, concentration camps were run by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II. The Nazis used concentration camps to kill millions of people in The Holocaust and force many others to work as slaves. However, many other countries have used concentration camps during wars or times of trouble.\nCamps in the 1800s.\nNative American \"reservations\".\nThe first modern concentration camps in the United States were created in 1838. Around this time, the United States was getting bigger. However, Native Americans lived in the lands that the United States wanted to take over.\nIn 1830, the United States Congress and President Andrew Jackson had passed a law called the Indian Removal Act. This law said that all Native Americans had to leave the United States and move to \"Indian Territory,\" west of the Mississippi River. However, many Cherokee people would not leave their lands. In May 1838, the United States government decided to force the Cherokee to leave the United States.\nFirst, soldiers forced about 17,000 Cherokee people, and 2,000 of their African-American slaves, into concentration camps, where they had to live during the summer of 1838. 353 Cherokee people died in the camps from dysentery and other diseases. Finally, the Cherokee were forced to travel to the area that is now Oklahoma. (At the time, Oklahoma was not in the United States.) The government also forced other Native American tribes to leave their lands and move west.\nSoon, many people from the United States started to move west. Now the United States was moving into Native American lands again. Starting around the 1860s, many Native American tribes fought back. These fights are now called the Indian Wars. The United States government reacted by forcing Native Americans to leave their lands again and move into concentration camps. The government called these camps \"Indian reservations.\" (They were called \"reservations\" because some land had been put aside, or \"reserved,\" for the Native Americans.) However, Native Americans were not allowed to leave their reservations. On some reservations, many people, especially children, died from hunger and sickness.\nAmerican Civil War camps.\nDuring the\u00a0American Civil War\u00a0in the\u00a01860s, soldiers who had been captured were sometimes put in camps. These camps were meant to be prisoner of war (POW) camps, with good conditions. However, as the war went on, both the Union and the Confederacy captured more enemy soldiers. The camps became very crowded, with terrible conditions. There was not enough food, and many men died from hunger. Also, there was also very little sanitation, which made it easy for diseases to spread. Many prisoners died from these diseases.\nThe deadliest prisoner of war camp during the Civil War was Andersonville prison. Andersonville was run by the Confederate States Army. At Andersonville, about one quarter of the prisoners died. \u00a0\nConditions at the Union's prisoner of war camps were also very bad. At four different Union camps, at least 15% of the prisoners in the camps died. At a camp called Fort Pulaski, Union soldiers starved 600 Confederate prisoners of war on purpose. 46 of them died. The Union soldiers did this to get revenge for how Union prisoners were treated at Andersonville Prison.\nBy the end of the Civil War, about 30,000 Union soldiers, and about 26,000 Confederate soldiers, had died in prisoner of war camps.\nSpain.\nIn the late 1800s, Cuba was a colony of the Spanish Empire. This meant Spain controlled Cuba. When Cuban people tried to rebel and fight for independence from 1895 to 1898, Spain created concentration camps and sent many Cuban people to live in them. This was called the \"Reconcentrado\" (\"Reconcentration\") Policy.\nThe people fighting for Cuban independence were guerrilla fighters. They did not wear military uniforms and could hide themselves in groups of civilians. They could also camp and hunt, without needing help from anybody to survive. To keep the guerrilla fighters from being able to do these things, the Spanish government decided to put Cuban people in concentration camps. The idea was that in the camps, Cuban people could be 'protected' by the Spanish Army until the Spanish Empire won the war. However, this idea did not work. At least 30% of the Cuban people in the camps died from hunger, disease, bad sanitation, and not having medicines. Also, the concentration camps did not help the Spanish win the war.\nCamps in the early 1900s.\nThe British Empire.\nBetween 1900 and 1902, the British Empire, led by Lord Kitchener, used concentration camps. At the time, they were fighting the Boer people in the Second Boer War\u00a0in\u00a0South Africa. At first, the British were not able to beat the Boers. They reacted by putting the Boer fighters' family members into concentration camps. They did this so these family members could not give food or help to the Boer fighters. The British soldiers also burned down the Boers' houses and farms, and destroyed all the crops they could find. They did this so the Boer fighters would not be able to find food or shelter anywhere.\nRussia &amp; the Soviet Union.\nRussia used prison camps, especially in places in the Arctic or Siberia, a long way from the main cities. The first prison camp in Russia was built in 1918. However, after the Soviet Union was formed in the 1922, the Soviet government started sending many more people to forced labor camps. By 1936, there were 5,000,000 inmates in these camps.\nThese camps are called \"zone\" in Russian. They are also commonly called \"gulags\". GULAG is an acronym for the Russian words \"Main Camp Administration\" (ru: \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f; Glavnoe upravlenye lagerey i mest zaklyucheniya). This was the government agency that was in charge of the prison camps while Josef Stalin led the Soviet Union. However, people who do not speak Russian often use the word \"gulag\" to talk about any forced labor camp in Russia or the Soviet Union.\nPeople sent to the gulags included:\nCamps during World War II.\nNazi Germany.\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany created many concentration camps, slave labor camps, and extermination camps (death camps). Nazi Germany's leader, Adolf Hitler, thought that certain groups of people were inferior (not as good as others). He even thought there were groups of people who did not deserve to live - he called them \"life unworthy of life.\" These three groups were Jews, Roma people, and people with disabilities. Hitler wanted his Nazis to kill every Jew, Roma, and disabled person in Europe.\nHitler also wanted to get rid of other groups he did not like, including people who he thought might challenge or fight the Nazi government. These people included socialists, communists, people of certain religions, and members of resistance movements (groups who tried to fight the Nazis any way they could).\nThe Nazis sent many of these people to concentration camps to work as slave labor. After a few years, some camps were set up just to kill people. These are now called \"extermination camps\" or \"death camps.\" At these camps, people were killed in gas chambers, shot, worked to death, and marched to death. Many people also died from disease and starvation in the camps.\nMore than half of the Jewish people who died in the Holocaust died at Nazi concentration camps. Just in the Auschwitz camps, at least 1.1 million people died (about 1,000,000 Jews and about 75,000 non-Jewish people, like Poles). Towards the end of World War II, the Nazis killed up to 20,000 people a day in the camps' gas chambers.\nIndependent State of Croatia.\nWith Nazi Germany's support, the Usta\u0161e\u00a0government of the new Independent State of Croatia (ISC) created concentration camps and extermination camps. Mainly, the camps were for Serbs. The ISC hated Serbs and thought of them as the ISC's biggest enemy. However, the Usta\u0161e also helped the Nazis with the \"Final Solution\" by killing many Jews in these camps. Other people the Usta\u0161e forced into the camps included Roma, Croats, Yugoslavians who had fought against the ISC, and people who broke rules and laws set by the ISC.\nJapanese-American internment camps.\nDuring World War II, the United States forced over 110,000 Japanese-Americans into\u00a0internment camps.\nOn December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In February 1942, the United States government ordered that nobody with Japanese ancestry could live on the West Coast. The government, led by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, thought that Japanese-American people might be spies for Japan, or might try to hurt the United States.\nAbout 80% of the Japanese-American people who lived in the continental United States were forced to leave their homes and live in internment camps. More than three out of every five of these people were born in the United States, and were United States citizens. About half of the people sent to the camps were children.\nAfter Canada declared war on Japan, it also forced people with Japanese ancestry into internment camps.\nIn the 1980s, the United States government admitted that Japanese-Americans were not a danger to the country during World War II. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a law that apologized for the internment camps. The law said \"there was no ... reason for the internment ... [and] the internment was caused by racial prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of [government] leadership[.]\"\nItaly.\nDuring World War II, Italy's fascist government (led by Benito Mussolini) was Nazi Germany's ally. Italy had taken over Yugoslavia, Greece, and the southeast part of France. The Nazis told Italy to put Jews from these areas in concentration camps and then send them to the Nazis' death camps. However, Italy refused. The Italian military and police would not help kill or deport Jews.\nHowever, in 1943, after Mussolini had lost power, Nazi Germany took over northern and central Italy. They also put Mussolini back in power. The Nazis created concentration camps to hold Italian Jews and other prisoners until they could be sent to death camps. In one of these concentration camps, called La Risiera di San Sabba, the Nazis tortured and murdered about 5,000 people. Many of these people were \"political prisoners\" - people who disagreed with the government.\nNorway.\nThe number of Nazi German occupation government's prison camps, were \"around 500\" or 709 including some death camps.\nSoviet Union.\nWhen Josef Stalin and the Soviet Union invaded Poland at the start of World War II, the Red Army deported at least 1.5 million Poles at gunpoint. They were forced to get into cattle wagons (train cars), which took them to Siberia. Whole families were deported to concentration camps, including children and the elderly.\nDuring the war, the Soviet Union also used gulags to hold prisoners of war from Nazi Germany and its allies.\nCamps in the late 1900s.\nLatin America.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, many military dictatorships in Latin America set up concentration camps to imprison, torture, and kill their political opponents (people who disagreed with them). For example:\nSoviet Union.\nThe Soviet Union kept using forced labour camps after World War II. In fact, the people they sent to the gulags after the war included Soviet soldiers and civilians who had been taken prisoner by the Nazis, or used as slave workers in Nazi Germany.\nIn 1973, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a Russian author, wrote \"The Gulag Archipelago\" about his experiences in a Soviet work camp.\nYugoslav Wars.\nIn the 1990s there were several concentration camps during the Yugoslav Wars.\nCamps in the 2000s.\nUnited States.\nSince January 2002, the United States has run the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison camp. Some people have called Guant\u00e1namo a concentration camp or a gulag. These people have included Fidel Castro, the leader of Amnesty International, and other activist groups like CounterPunch.\nAustralia.\nThe Pacific Solution is the name given to the Australian government policy of transporting asylum seekers to detention centres on island nations in the Pacific Ocean, rather than allowing them to land on the Australian mainland.\nGaza.\nOften said to be \"the world's largest blockade\", Gaza is blockaded by the state of Israel to the north, east, and west, and by the state of Egypt to the south. Hamas is a terrorist organisation originated in Gaza. They are Gaza's leading dictators. In addition to preventing Palestinins from exit of camp. Since 2007, Israel and Egypt have implemented a crushing blockade, preventing weapons from being smuggling in, while supplying basic goods like spices, candles, fishing equipment, baby chicks, and even cement. Israel's military has been active in the region to ensure Israel's safety."}

They are tiny molecular robots which make proteins. They do RNA translation, building proteins from amino acids using messenger RNA as a template. Ribosomes are found in all living cells, prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes.\nA ribosome is a mixture of protein and RNA that starts being made in the nucleolus of a cell. The nucleolus is in the nucleus. The nucleus is protected by the nuclear envelope, and lets things out through the nuclear pores. Ribosomes move from the nucleolus into the cytoplasm. Most ribosomes sit on the endoplasmic reticulum, but are also found throughout the cytoplasm.\n\"The job of the ribosome is to make new proteins\". It does this by moving along a strand of messenger RNA and building a protein based on the code it reads. Making a protein this way is called translation. \nWe need up to 10 million robots (ribosomes) in every cell. To get this number, cells have many copies of rRNA genes. We inherit about 400 rRNA genes across five different chromosomes.\nRibosome structure.\nRibosomes are made out of two things: a small ribosomal subunit that reads the mRNA, while the large subunit joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and a variety of proteins.\nEukaryotes have 80S ribosomes, each consisting of a small (40S) and large (60S) subunit. Their small subunit has a 16S RNA sub-unit (consisting of 1540 nucleotides) bound to 21 proteins. The large subunit has a 5S RNA (120 nucleotides), a 28S RNA (4700 nucleotides), a 5.8S RNA (160 nucleotides) subunits and 46 proteins."}

In 1966, he got sick. He forgot some of his lines, and argued with the people who made the show. Then he left \"Doctor Who\". Patrick Troughton became the new Doctor.\nHartnell's health got worse and in December 1974, he went to hospital. On 23 April 1975, he died in his sleep at the age of 67.\nAccording to some of his colleagues on \"Doctor Who\", he could be a difficult person to work with. Others, though, such as actors Peter Purves and William Russell, and producer Verity Lambert, spoke glowingly of him after more than 40 years. Carole Ann Ford, who played the Doctor's granddaughter Susan, has said she and Hartnell \"got on terribly well\", saying \"It upsets me when I hear people saying he was difficult to work with, he was very sweet\" Hartnell also adored Verity Lambert, and had great respect for Waris Hussein. Hartnell also admired singer Paul Robeson. In his \"Desert Island Discs\" interview, Hartnell stated that Paul Robeson was his hero and described him as having a voice like crushed velvet."}

It is also sometimes called the Third Reich (), which means the 'Third Empire' or 'Third Realm'. The first German empire was the Holy Roman Empire. The second was the German Empire of 1871 - 1918. The Nazis said they were making the third, even if itself never was the monarchy at all. However, the term 'Third Reich' was more popular in other countries. In Germany it was merely The Reich (pronounced 'rike') or the Greater German Reich ().\nAdolf Hitler led Nazi Germany until it was defeated in World War II in the Battle of Berlin, when he killed himself in 1945. The Nazi Party was destroyed in the same year as its leaders ran away, were arrested, or killed themselves. Some were executed for war crimes by the Western and Soviet powers. Others survived, with some of them getting important jobs. However, their racial policies never again held power in Germany.\nThe Nazi government was formed under the idea that the \"Aryan race\" (pure white Germans) deserved to rule over all other races. This idea gained respect after the Great Depression made many important Germans poor and powerless. Hitler blamed the problems on Jews, communists, liberals, and many others. He made many Germans feel like they were innocent victims who had to take charge over Europe. The Nazis also tried to create an empire with colonies, and used their ally Italy's colonies in Africa as a model.\nWhen the Nazi government was destroyed at the end of World War II, Germany was split into four \"occupation zones\". The Soviet Union took East Germany while the United Kingdom, France, and the United States took portions of West Germany.\nHistory.\nThe Nazis came to power in 1933 and made their power absolute with an \"Enabling Law\" and an unfair referendum. They centralized Germany, replacing local self-government. They strengthened the economy by doing business with major companies like General Motors and IBM. They expanded the Schutzstaffel to control the local police, and started the Gestapo to find, jail, and kill political enemies. They immediately banned Jews from important jobs, and soon restricted them in other ways. After a few years they built the armed forces far beyond the limits of the Treaty of Versailles. They also cooperated and made agreements with Italy and Japan.\nWorld War II: 1939-1945.\nOn September 1st, 1939, German forces attacked Poland, which began World War II. With over a million troops, Hitler's army easily took over Poland, losing about 59,000 soldiers. Their country was also attacked by the Soviet Union from the east. Poland lost over 900,000 soldiers.\nOn October 12, 1939, Hitler sent a letter to the United Kingdom promising peace. The British continued the war.\nHitler conquered France in the Battle of France. Then he sent the Luftwaffe to attack England. Winston Churchill, now Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, did not surrender. The Battle of Britain lasted from July to October 1940. When it failed, Hitler ordered the mass bombardment of London. That also failed, and Hitler decided to face east for his racial war of destroying the Slavs and Jews. This gave Britain time to regain power.\nIn 1941, Hitler ordered \"Operation Barbarossa.\" It lasted from June 22, 1941 until December 5, 1941. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, had weakened his army with his Great Purges, which had killed many Russian officers before the war.\nDuring Operation Barbarossa, many more Soviet soldiers died than Germans. At Stalingrad, however, about a million soldiers died on each side. While the Soviet Union could replace its losses, Germany could not.\nAfter Stalingrad, the Germans lost their momentum. The Soviets learned from the long campaigns, fought better, and gained many new weapons from very efficient factories. The United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union fought together, and pushed against the smaller German army. In May 1945, they took over Berlin to win the war.\nMany people from all sides of the war died fighting in Europe, including:\nWhile fighting in the Soviet Union:\nAfter the Allies took over Germany, the Soviets set up the German Democratic Republic in the east that followed communism as a socialist state. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France set up the Federal Republic of Germany in the west as a democratic country."}

Franklin and the fifth of six overall in between past relationships by her parents. Franklin's family moved to Buffalo, when Franklin was two, and then by four, had settled in Detroit. Following the move to Detroit, Franklin's parents, who had a troubled marriage, split. Due to her father's work as a Baptist minister, Franklin was primarily raised by her grandmother, Rachel. Franklin suffered a tragedy when her mother died in Buffalo when Aretha was ten. Franklin sang in church at an early age and learned how to play piano by ear. By her late preteens, Franklin was regularly singing solo numbers in her father's New Bethel Baptist Church. Franklin's father, C.L. (short for Clarence LaVaughn), was a respected and popular preacher. Franklin grew up with local and national celebrities hanging out at her father's home including gospel greats Albertina Walker and her group The Caravans, Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward, three women who played a pivotal role in her vocal development as a child.\nLater life: 1961\u20132018.\nFranklin married Ted White in 1961 but divorced him in 1969. She had four sons, one of which she shares with White.\nFranklin was married to Glynn Turman from 1978 to 1984.\nIn 1998, Franklin performed at that year's VH1 \"Divas Live\" concert with C\u00e9line Dion, Carole King, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, and Gloria Estefan to sing songs like \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", \"Testify\", and \"You've Got a Friend in Me\".\nHonors.\nFranklin is one of the most honored artists by the Grammy Awards, with 18 competitive Grammys and two honorary Grammys. She had 20 #1 singles on the Billboard R&amp;B Singles Chart and two #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Respect\" (1967) and \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\" (1987), a duet with George Michael. Since 1961, she had a total of 45 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. She also had 14 singles that sold more than one million \u2013 more than any other female artist.

Bush. On February 6, 2006, she performed, along with Aaron Neville, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XL. The same year she got an honorary Doctor of Music degree by the Berklee College of Music.2010, Franklin received an Honorary Doctorate in Music from Yale University.\nIn 1987, Franklin became the first female artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She was the only featured singer at the 2009 presidential inauguration of Barack Obama.\nHealth.\nIn 2010, Franklin underwent cancer surgery for purported pancreatic cancer. In 2013, she cancelled two tours due to an unknown illness.\nIn 2017, Franklin cancelled many concerts due to an unknown illness. She asked her fans to keep her in their prayers. \nDeath.\nOn August 13, 2018, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home near Detroit. She was reported to be under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder and Jesse Jackson, among others, had visited her. Franklin died at home in Detroit on August 16, aged 76. The cause was reported to be advanced pancreatic cancer. \"Business Insider\" reported that Franklin's net worth was $80 million at the time of her death and that she did not leave a will.\nCultural portrayal.\nIn 2020, singer and actress Jennifer Hudson will play Franklin in the 2020 movie about her life titled \"Respect\".\nGrammy Awards.\nFranklin won 20 Grammy Awards in her lifetime, including two special awards for Living Legend (1991) and Lifetime Achievement (1994)."}

It has many small seeds. It is also very good for health. Most tomatoes are red. The tomato is green when it is unripe. It slowly changes color from green to red as it gets ripe, and as it gets ripe it gets bigger and bigger. There are many different types of tomatoes. Some kinds of tomato are yellow or orange when they are ripe. Tomatoes are used a lot in Italian food. They are also used to make ketchup. Tomatoes are called fruit, because they contain seeds. Tomato seeds are dispersed by being eaten by animals. After being eaten the seeds pass through the animal's digestive system. Although tomatoes are botanically fruits, many people consider them vegetables and treat them as such in cooking.\nHistory.\nThe tomato is native to western South America. Wild versions were small, like cherry tomatoes, and most likely yellow instead of red. The Spanish first showed tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish and Italian food. The French and northern Europeans wrongly thought that they were poisonous because they are a member of the deadly nightshade family. The leaves and immature fruit contains tomatine, which in large amounts would be toxic. However, the ripe fruit contains no tomatine.\nAs food.\nThe tomato is grown and eaten around the world. It is used in many ways, such as raw in salads or in slices, stewed, a part of a wide variety of dishes, or processed into ketchup or tomato soup. Unripe green tomatoes can also be breaded and fried, used to make salsa, or pickled. Tomato juice is sold as a drink, and is used in cocktails such as the Bloody Mary."}

The pineapple is also a tropical plant and it must not be kept under 10 degrees. It takes a long time for the pineapple to grow. It mainly depends on the location and the growing conditions it gets. If the temperature is warm, the pineapple will grow faster. On average, it takes about two to three years to grow. If the fruit travels by boat, the fruit must be picked before ripening, since the trip takes a long time. Sometimes, pineapple has to travel by boat to be accessible to all. It is different for air travel. The pineapple can be picked when it is grown, since travel time is short. In most countries, they call the pineapple \"ananas\".\nNutrition.\nA pineapple contains fiber and vitamin C. The stem of the pineapple has an enzyme having healing effects, anti-inflammatory effects and it may reduce edema. The enzyme from the pineapple is also beneficial for a person who wants to go on a good diet. Pineapple contains a lot of manganese and the body needs manganese to build strong bones.\nVarieties.\nIn the world, there are a lot of varieties of pineapples. In fact, there are more than one hundred varieties and they grow in different sizes too. Four of those are the main varieties:\nSymbolism.\nEarly Europeans commonly called any kind of fruit an apple, and that is why the Spanish thought pineapples looked like pine cones. Pineapples have nothing to do with pine cones and apples, but because of the similar shape between the pineapple and the pine cone, most people change it into symbolism. Both have been used for symbolizing fertility. The pineapple symbolized friendship and hospitality to the Caribs. These people usually hung pineapples outside their huts to show their welcome."}

They can be baked, canned, frozen, or eaten fresh. They can be made into jams, jellies or juice. They can also be made into pies and put into salads or baby food. They are eighty three percent water. It has a green, red, yellow, or brown skin. The pear originated from Europe, Africa and Asia. Pear trees grow in heavy soil.\nPears are in the subfamily Maloideae with apples. It is a subfamily of the family \"Rosaceae\".\nDescription.\nThe pear comes from the tree Pyrus communis, also called the common pear tree. The tree can be high. They live an average of 65 years. It starts as a pyramid-shaped tree. As it grows becomes rounded. It ends up becoming oval. This tree has gray bark covered with cracks. Its leaves are dark green and long. The flowers are pink or white and up to long.\nThe pear needs soil that is neither too dry nor too wet. It grows best in temperate and humid climates. \nAccording to Pear Bureau Northwest, about 3000 known varieties of pears are grown worldwide.\nHistory.\nThe pear comes from Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It grew during the Neolithic era. Its standard form is the result of different hybridizations from wild specimens.\nThe pear was also cultivated by the Romans, who ate the fruits raw or cooked, just like apples."}

Many different cultivars have been produced, especially of muskmelons. Botanically speaking, the melon is a fruit, but some kinds are often considered vegetables. Most melons belong to the genus \"Cucumis\", but there are also some that belong to \"Benincasa\", \"Citrullus\" and \"Momordica\". The muskmelon belongs to \"Cucumis\", while the watermelon belongs to \"Citrullus\".\nThe word \"melon\" comes from the Latin ', which itself comes from the Greek (').\nHistory.\nMelons come from Africa and southwest Asia. They gradually began to appear in Europe toward the end of the Roman Empire. Melons were introduced to America by early settlers, who grew honeydew and casaba melons as early as the 1600s. A number of Native American groups in New Mexico have a tradition of growing their own kinds of melon cultivars, derived from melons originally introduced by the Spanish.\nNutrition.\nMelons are a nutritious food. The seeds of cantaloupe were used in China to moderate fevers and the digestive system. Elsewhere, seeds were ground into a powder and used to treat tuberculosis. Cantaloupes are particularly beneficial to people with heart disease, as they have large of amounts of an anticoagulant known as adenosine. They also have high levels of potassium, which benefits those with high blood pressure. Due to their high water content, all melons are considered diuretics.\nThere is also evidence that suggests that eating melons can lower the risk of cancer. USDA researchers discovered that melons have lycopene, an antioxidant found in a select group of fruits and vegetables. Lycopene treats and prevents cancer by trapping free-radicals in cells."}

When it is grown by people, the height it is usually kept between 3 and 4 m (10 and 13 feet) by pruning. Its leaves are green and pointy. They usually have glands that make a liquid to attract insects.\nPeaches are also called stone fruits because they have a shell of hard wood around their seed, called a stone or a pit. The skin of a peach is an orange or yellow color, and it is covered in small hairs called \"peach fuzz\". A peach without the fuzz is usually called a nectarine. The inside of a peach is a golden color. It tastes sweet and sticky. Because of this, peaches are often part of desserts.\nSymbolism.\nThe peach first came from China. It has been grown from at least since 1000 B.C.E. In Chinese culture, the peach tree is considered to be the tree of life and peaches are symbols of immortality. Peach blossoms are carried by Chinese brides. It is also considered as the \"National fruit of Afghanistan\" and the \"Provincial fruit of Balochistan, Pakistan\" respectively.\nLifespan of a peach.\nBecause of the cold winter, diseases, and pests, peach trees can usually only live about 10 to 12 years. However, if a peach tree is fertilized properly, and taken care of in the right way, it may live more years.\nPests.\nBrown rot.\n\"Brown rot\" is a very dangerous kind of peach disease. It can attack the blossoms and stop the fruit from developing. If it is not stopped quickly, good quality fruit can not be produced from the peach tree.\nPeach leaf curl.\n\"Peach leaf curl\", which is another very serious disease, makes the leaves curl up and begin to die in spring. It can be stopped if it meets fungicide.\nBacterial spot.\n\"Bacterial spot\" gives harm to the leaves, twigs and fruit. By the time the disease is recognized, it is often too late to stop it. However, some kind of sprays may be used early in the next season to protect the peach tree.\nCankers.\n\"Cankers\" is a kind of disease that infects the twigs and branches. They make large amounts of amber-colored gum spill out from the infected branch. Later, the bark will crack open completely and the tissue of the twig turns black. Cankers can be removed by pruning.\nInsects.\nThere are several kinds of insect pests that can be great trouble to the peach. The Oriental fruit moth can make the peaches filled with worms and young growing tips may die. The plum curculio lays its eggs on the fruit, and makes them drop off or become filled with worms. Insects like the tarnished plant bug and the stink bug eat up the fruit that is still developing. Borers attack the base of the trunk and the branches."}

Its skin is very thin and has many small seeds inside of it. There are more than 850 kinds of \"Ficus\", the fig tree.\nThe fruits can be eaten when ripe and when dried. Figs grow in warm climates. Sometimes, figs are made into jam. Figs are also in a popular snack.\nFigs are pollinated by fig wasps.\nFig fruit.\nMany figs are grown for their fruit, though only the common fig is grown to any amount for eating.\nThe fig is a false fruit or multiple fruit, in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. Depending on the type, each fruit can contain up to several hundred to several thousand seeds.\nA fig \"fruit\" is derived from a special type of an arrangement of multiple flowers. In this case, it is a turned inwards, nearly closed, with many small flowers arranged on the inside.\nThen the actual flowers of the fig are not seen unless the fig is cut open. It is a fruit without a seen flower.\nContents of the fruit.\nThe fig fruits, important as both food and traditional medicine, contain laxative substances, pigments, sugars, vitamins A and C, acids and enzymes. However, figs are skin allergies, and the sap is a big eye irritant.\nFarmed figs.\nSome 'virgin fruit' farms of common figs do not require pollination at all, and will produce a crop of seedless edible figs without fig wasps. This section explains how this is done.\nPollination and fig wasps.\nThe syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening (the ostiole) at the outward end used by pollinators. The flowers are pollinated by very small wasps which crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs.\nWithout this, fig trees cannot reproduce by seed. In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps. This has led to a co-evolutionary relationship.\nFig plants can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or gynodioecious (hermaphrodite and female). Nearly half of fig species are gynodioecious, and have plants with inflorescences (syconium) with long styled pistillate flowers, or have plants with staminate flowers mixed with short styled pistillate flowers. The long flower styles tend to prevent wasps from laying their eggs within the ovules, while the short styled flowers are accessible for egg laying.\nThe common fig (\"Ficus carica\") is a gynodioecious plant, which means its fruits are either hermaphrodite and \"inedible figs\" or caprifigs. In traditional culture in the Mediterranean region they were considered food for goats (\"Capra aegagrus\"): 'caprifig' means 'goat fig'. In the female fig trees, the male flower parts fail to develop; they produce the \"edible figs\".\nFig wasps grow in caprifigs but not in the female syconiums. The female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them. Nonetheless, the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the caprifig it grew up in. When the wasp dies, it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig. This means you do not eat the wasp because it has been dissolved. The wasp does not transmit any diseases harmful to humans.\nCultivation.\nThe edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans.\nCo-evolution.\nThere is typically \"only one species of wasp that is able to pollinate the flowers of each type of fig\". For example, in Hawaii, some 60 types of figs have been introduced, but only four of the wasps that pollinate them have been introduced, so only four species of figs produce possible seeds there. This is an example of a helping relationship, in which each fig plant and fig wasp benefit each other.\nThe close relationship between fig types and their pollinators, and the one-to-one plant-pollinator ratio are a clear example of coevolution. Recent analyses have shown a close correspondence in the evolution and evolutionary process of these two, figs and wasps."}

Wild grapevines are often considered a nuisance weed, as they cover other plants with their usually rather aggressive growth.\nRaisins are the dried fruit of the grapevine, and the name actually comes from the French word for \"grape.\"\nSince the early 21st century in the United States and other countries, and the global functional food industry, there has been a fast-growing recognition of red grapes for their popularity, nutrient content and antioxidant qualities. This has given them commercial status as a \"superfruit\".\nThe leaves of the grapevine itself are considered edible (eatable). They are used to make dolmades.\nGrapevines are used as food plants by the larvae of some [[Lepidoptera ]. ] species.\nDistribution.\nAccording to the \"Food and Agriculture Organization\" (FAO), almost 76,000 square kilometres of the world is used to grow grapes. About 71% of grapes are used for wine. 27% are used as fresh fruit, and 2% are used as dried fruit.

This helps prevent clogging of the arteries. Doctors do not recommend drinking a lot of red wine, but three or four glasses a week is good and encouraged.\nGrapes of all colors offer benefits. Red [[wine]] offers health benefits that are not found in white wine. This is because many of the good nutrients are found in the skins of the grapes, and only red wine is fermented with the skins.\nWhite grapes.\nWhite grapes are derived from the green grape by [[evolution]].

For example, \nMomentum is a vector quantity, which has both direction and magnitude. Its unit is \"kg m/s\" (kilogram metre per second) or \"N s\" (newton second).\nMomentum is a conserved quantity, meaning that the total initial momentum of a system must be equal to the total final momentum of the system. The total momentum remains unchanged.\nFormula.\nIn Newtonian physics, the usual symbol for momentum is the letter p ; so this can be written\nwhere p is the momentum, \"m\" is the mass and v is the velocity\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf we apply Newton's 2nd Law, we can derive\nThe meaning is that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change in momentum of the object.\nIn order to use this equation in special relativity, m has to change with speed. That is sometimes called the \"relativistic mass\" of the object. (Scientists who work with special relativity use other equations instead.)\nImpulse.\nImpulse is the change in momentum caused by a new force: this force will increase or decrease the momentum depending on the direction of the force; towards or away from the body that was moving before. If the new force (N) is going in the direction of the momentum of the body (x), the momentum of x will increase; therefore if N is going towards body x in the opposite direction, x will slow down and its momentum will decrease.\nLaw of conservation of momentum.\nIn understanding conservation of momentum, the direction of the momentum is important. In a system, momentum is added up using vector addition. Under the rules of vector addition, adding a certain amount of momentum together with the same amount of momentum going in the opposite direction gives a total momentum of zero.\nFor instance, when a gun is fired, a small mass (the bullet) moves at a high speed in one direction. A larger mass (the gun) moves in the opposite direction at a much slower speed. The momentum of the bullet and the momentum of the gun are exactly equal in size but opposite in direction. Using vector addition to add the momentum of the bullet to the momentum of the gun (equal in size but opposite in direction) gives a total system momentum of zero. The momentum of the gun-bullet system has been conserved.\nA collision also shows conservation of momentum: if a car (1000\u00a0kg) is going right at 8\u00a0m/s, and a truck (6000\u00a0kg) is going left at 2\u00a0m/s, the car and truck will be moving left after the collision. This exercise shows why:\nMomentum = Mass x Velocity\nThe car's momentum: 1000\u00a0kg x 8\u00a0m/s = 8000kgm/s (Going right)\nThe truck's momentum: 6000\u00a0kg x 2\u00a0m/s = 12000kgm/s (Going left)\nThis means their total momentum is 4000kgm/s. (Going left)"}

First, layers of sand build up as sediment, either from water or from air (as in a desert). \nThen sand particles are compacted by pressure of overlying deposits, and cemented ('glued' together). The 'cement' is either calcite (calcium carbonate), quartz (silica), or clay. Iron oxide often makes sandstone a reddish colour."}

Many people use pseudonyms, including authors (pen names) and performers (stage names). People use pseudonyms for several different reasons: to hide identity, gender, and/or race. People (such as rappers) also use pseudonyms to match their stage personality better. Pseudonyms can include stage names, screen names, ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names.\n\"Pseudonym\" comes from the Greek word (\"pseud\u1e53nymon\"), which means \"false name\".\nUse and Examples of Pseudonyms.\nThere are three main types of pseudonyms: pen names, stage names and user-names. Pen names are used by authors, usually to hide identity. Many famous books, such as The Outsiders and A Series of Unfortunate Events, have been written by authors using a pseudonym. Daniel Handler wrote A Series of Unfortunate Events under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket both because he wanted to make the author a character in the story and because he wanted to hide his real name. When she published The Outsiders, Susan Eloise Hinton decided to use her initials, S. E., instead of her first and middle names, because she did not want readers to guess her gender. The Bront\u00eb sisters (Anne, Emily and Charlotte) used pseudonyms to hide the fact that they based many of their characters on their neighbors.\nMusicians, actors and performers also use pseudonyms, called stage names, both to hide their identity and to give themselves a \"cooler\" name. For example, rapper Sean Combs is currently known by Diddy, but used to call himself P Diddy and Puff Daddy. He says that he changed his name from P Diddy to Diddy because the name \"caused confusion and he wanted to 'simplify things'.\" \nMany people on the Internet use pseudonyms. There are many names for these pseudonyms, including user-names, user IDs and handles. These pseudonyms help people stay anonymous on the internet, and they also protect people from identity theft and phishing. When people log into an account on sites like Wikipedia, MySpace or Facebook, their user-name helps identify them without entering their real name. If people used their real name instead of a user-name, it would create confusion for two people with the same name. Usernames make this simple, because people create their own user-names. Also, if someone used their real name, it would make it easier for people to guess their passwords and for other people to find them in real life.\nSometimes criminals would use a pseudonym. For example, com man Jefferson R. Smith was also known as Soapy Smith."}

It says that:\nThis means that there are no examples where formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5 are natural numbers, i.e. whole numbers larger than zero, and where formula_1 is a whole number bigger than 2. Pierre de Fermat wrote about it in 1637 inside his copy of a book called \"Arithmetica\". He said \"I have a proof of this theorem, but there is not enough space in this margin\". However, no correct proof was found for 357 years. It was finally proven in 1995. Mathematicians everywhere think that Fermat, in fact, did not have a good proof of this theorem.\nOverview.\nFermat's Last Theorem is a more general form of the Pythagorean theorem, which is an equation that says:\nWhen formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 are whole numbers this is called a \"Pythagorean triple\". For example, formula_11, and since formula_12 we can say formula_13 is a Pythagorean triple. Fermat's Last Theorem rewrites this as\nand claims that, if you make the formula_1 a larger whole number than 2, then formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 cannot all be natural numbers. For example, formula_19 and formula_20, and so formula_21 is an example that confirms this.\nProof.\nThe proof was made for \"some\" values of formula_1, such as formula_23, formula_24, formula_25 and formula_26, which was managed by many mathematicians including Fermat, Euler, Sophie Germain. However, since there are an infinite number of Pythagorean triples, as numbers count upwards forever, this made Fermat's Last Theorem hard to prove or disprove; the full proof must show that the equation has no solution for all values of formula_1 (when formula_1 is a whole number bigger than 2) but it is not possible to simply check every combination of numbers if they continue forever.\nAn English mathematician named Andrew Wiles found a solution in 1995, 358 years after Fermat wrote about it. Richard Taylor helped him find the solution . The proof took eight years of research. He proved the theorem by first proving the modularity theorem, which was then called the TaniyamaShimura conjecture. Using Ribet's Theorem, he was able to give a proof for Fermat's Last Theorem. He received the Wolfskehl Prize from G\u00f6ttingen Academy in June 1997: it amounted to about $50,000 U.S. dollars.\nAfter a few years of debate, people agreed that Andrew Wiles had solved the problem. Andrew Wiles used a lot of modern mathematics and even created new maths when he made his solution. This mathematics was unknown when Fermat wrote his famous note, so Fermat could not have used it. This leads one to believe that Fermat did not in fact have a complete solution of the problem."}

It is a territory and not part of the fifty states. The Chamorro people are the native people from Guam. The capital of Guam is the city of Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a and the largest city is Dededo. Guam has important United States Air Force and Naval bases, which occupy a major part of Guam's land area. Guam is also a popular tourist destination.\nHistory.\nGuam was one of the first islands in the Pacific Ocean to be visited by the Europeans. In 1521, while leading the Spanish expedition, Ferdinand Magellan became one of the first European to set foot on Guam. From then on, Guam became an important part of the trade route followed by the Spanish trading ships called Manila Galleon, which sailed between Mexico and the Philippines every year. And in 1668, Spain took over Guam as one of its territory. During this time, the natives assimilated the Spanish culture to a large extent.\nIn the 1898, Spanish\u2013American War, Spain lost most of its territories to the United States under the Treaty of Paris, including Guam, Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. Guam continued to be important due to its strategic location for shipping, and later for air travel in the Pacific. During World War II, Japan occupied Guam in 1941 for 31 months, but lost the territory to the United States soon after. The Chamorro people are spread across Guam and Northern Mariana Islands- which is also a United States territory. However, the Chamorro people from Northern Mariana Islands have not integrated well into the territory as they were under Japanese occupation for about 30 years.\nIn 1950, the United States Congress passed a law to incorporate the people of Guam as American citizens.\nIn August 2017, North Korea warned that it might launch mid-range ballistic missiles into waters within 18 to 24 miles of Guam, following an exchange of threats between the governments of North Korea and the United States.\nMoney.\nGuam gets most of its money from the United States government. Much of that money is spent on the military bases, but there are also federal grants given to the Guam government for various programs. Because it is only a territory, federal income taxes paid by Guam residents are given to the Guam government for its operations.\nGuam is a sought after travel destination. Almost all of these visitors are from Japan. Japanese tourists like Guam because it is closer to Japan than other American places. Guam has lots of hotels and other fun places for people to visit. Tumon Bay is Guam's biggest beach. It has lots of pretty white sand, and the water has lots of fish. Tumon is becoming a busy city.\nThe number of visitors to Guam has decreased significantly mainly because of economic slowdown in most parts of Asia, which is also the cause for lost jobs in Guam.\nLand and water.\nGuam is 212 square miles (549 square kilometers) large. In the north part, it has a flat area of coral and limestone rock. The south part has mountains. Around the island is a coral reef.\nGuam is next to the Marianas Trench, which is the deepest part of the Earth and underwater. It sometimes has earthquakes, some of which have been very strong.\nGuam is a tropical island. It is usually quite warm and wet and the temperature does not change very much. From February to July it is dry, but the rest of the year it is rainy. Sometimes Guam has very strong and dangerous storms in October and November."}

To its west is Northeast India, to its east is the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar. Bangladesh's capital and largest city is Dhaka (formerly \"Dacca\"). Countries that are near Bangladesh include the People's Republic of China, Bhutan, and Nepal. To the south of Bangladesh is the Bay of Bengal. \nBangladesh became an independent country in 1971, breaking away from Pakistan after fighting a war in which over a million people died. Most people in Bangladesh are Muslim. Bangladesh has has an area of 57,320 mi\u00b2 or (142,576 km\u00b2). It is slightly smaller than Tajikistan. It ranks 92 out of 195 sovereign countries by area. There are two main rivers in Bangladesh: The Ganges and the Brahmaputra River. They are important to Hindu people. There are often floods in Bangladesh because of these two rivers. \nBangladesh has a population of 174.3 million people. \nHistory.\nFor much of its history, the Bangladesh was simply just called Bengal and was considered a part of India. The Bengal delta has been ruled by Hindu rulers, Muslim rulers, and even the British empire. People have lived in Bangladesh for thousands of years. Farming developed in Bangladesh very early on. By 500 BC, people grew rice there. Farming lead to the development of urban areas like cities. Early houses in Bangladesh were likely built of wood and mud, and adobe. Because Bangladesh has monsoons, there is not a lot of evidence of ancient people living there. From about 300 BC to the 1700s AD, technology like writing and the Bengali language developed. During this time, many religions were popular and many states were founded. By the 1500s, the area was rich and even peasants had plenty to eat.\nBengal under Mughal rule.\nIn the 13th century, Turkic armies took over the Bengal delta. During this time, the delta was ruled by Hindu leaders. In 1202, the last major Hindu Sena leader was pushed out from his capital in Western Bengal, but they stayed for a short time in East Bengal. \nIn 1206, a Muslim kingdom called the Delhi Sultanate was founded. The rulers of the Bengal delta became friendly with the sultanate, and to stay separately ruled the Bengal rulers would pay tribute to the sultanate using war elephants. In 1341, Bengal became independent from Delhi, and Dhaka became the capital of independent Bengal. In 1576, Bengal was taken over by Akbar the Great, a Mughal emperor. Bengal stayed part of the Mughal Empire until the eighteenth century. \nWhen the Mughals ruled the Bengal, they began to make Bengal part of India politically. Bengal, however, was too far away from the Mughal capital in Delhi. Because it was hard to talk to Bengal, local governors found it easy to ignore what the Mughals wanted for Bengal. Although Bengal remained a province, religious leaders and scientists from Mughal-ruled Bengal have been famous throughout India. \nAs Bengal was part of their empire, the Mughals helped it grow. They built a road from Delhi to Dhaka, started a postal service, and helped make their calendar better. This calendar is still used in Bangladesh today. The Mughals also collected taxes in Bengal. Soon, Bengal was the richest province and was called the \"Breadbasket of India\". The Mughals used Bengali resources to help maintain their army, but they did not help protect the Bengali people from pirates. This made the Bengali people angry, and the Mughals had to appoint powerful generals to help rule Bengal. Despite this, Bengal became a center of the textile trade in South Asia. \nIn 1704, the capital of Bengal was moved from Dhaka to Murshidabad. In 1707, Aurangzeb, who people think is the last great Mughal emperor, died. After this, governors in Bengal still paid tribute to the Mughal empire, but were mostly left alone. These governors protected Bengal from Hindu Marathas during the eighteenth century. When the Mughal governor Alivardi died in 1756, he left rule of Bengal to his grandson, who would lose Bengal to the British in 1757.\nBengal under British rule.\n\"Main article: Bengal Presidency\"\nBengal was under British rule from 1757-1947. It was part of British India. English was made one of the official languages of the Bengal Presidency.\nBengal as East Pakistan.\nIn 1947, East Bengal and the Dominion of Pakistan were separated from India, becoming Pakistan. Pakistan was cut in half, its east and west parts separated by 930 miles (1,500 km) of India. In 1949, the Bangladesh Awami League formed, wanting the east and west parts of Pakistan separated. In 1955, East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan, with Dacca becoming the capital. The people living in East Pakistan were mostly ethnically Bengali, spoke Bengali, and had a different culture compared to the people of western Pakistan. These differences eventually led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.\nIndependence from Pakistan.\nBangladesh declared itself as independent from Pakistan in 1971 after a liberation war in which over a million people died. After Indian military intervention, the provisional government returned from exile in Calcutta, Bengal (India). After the Instrument of Surrender, the Bengali peoples became a sovereign nation.\nAfter Bangladesh became independent, Bengal replaced Urdu and English as the only national and official language. Bengal is used in government, business, and schools. Private English-language schools for upper-class students existed into the 1980s. English is now taught in higher education and is offered as a university subject.\nAt first, people began to stop speaking Arabic in Bangladesh. In 1983, after Bangladesh strengthened its ties with Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich countries, people tried to make Arabic a required language to learn in school. Arabic is widely studied today in Madrassas and Islamic schools so people can understand Islamic texts better.\nDespite gaining independence in 1971, Bangladesh is a poor country and has problems with political corruption. Presently, more than half the population can read and write.\nPolitics.\nThe President of Bangladesh acts as Head of state, but the Prime Minister of Bangladesh acts as Head of government. The president is elected by lawmakers every 5 years, and has limited powers. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but sometimes the president has do more than usual. This is called a Caretaker government.\nThe prime minister is chosen by the president and must be a member of parliament (MP). The Cabinet is made up of people chosen by the prime minister, and is appointed by the president.\nBangladesh's parliament is called the House of the Nation, or the \"Jatiya Sangsad\", and has only one chamber. The \"Jatiya Sangsad\" has 300 members who are elected by popular vote, and they have 5-year terms of office. The highest judiciary body in Bangladesh is the Supreme Court, whose members are chosen by the president.\nAfter famines in 1973 and 1974, the prime minister of Bangladesh instituted a one-party socialist state. After this, a military junta ruled Bangladesh until 1990. Since then, Bangladesh has become a parliamentary democracy. In 2007, a caretaker government was appointed to help end corruption in Bangladeshi politics. Many politicians were arrested on corruption charges. \nGeography.\nBangladesh is in the Ganges Delta. This is where the rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna come together. Most parts of Bangladesh are less than above the sea level. The highest point in Bangladesh is in Mowdok range at in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to the southeast of the country. Cox's Bazar, south of the city of Chittagong, has a beach that is uninterrupted over .\nA large part of the coastline is a marshy jungle, the Sundarbans. They are the largest mangrove forest in the world.\nBangladesh has heavy cyclones and natural disasters, due to this many lives are often lost. The country is one of the most densely populated in the world. Cyclones are very common in the Bay of Bengal during the middle of the year, particularly in the south of country in areas like Sundarban, Chittagong, Cox's Bazaar, or in neighboring Myanmar and Republic of India. Despite the many storms, Bangladesh does not have a very effective storm prevention system, and cyclones usually inflict heavy damage.\nDivisions.\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions: Barisal (\u09ac\u09b0\u09bf\u09b6\u09be\u09b2), Chittagong (\u099a\u099f\u09cd\u099f\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09ae), Dhaka (\u09a2\u09be\u0995\u09be), Khulna (\u0996\u09c1\u09b2\u09a8\u09be), Rajshahi (\u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09b6\u09be\u09b9\u09c0), Sylhet (\u09b8\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7\u099f), and Rangpur (\u09b0\u0982\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0).\nDivisions are divided into districts. There are 64 districts in Bangladesh.\nDhaka is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. Other major cities include Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Barisal, Bogra, Comilla, Mymensingh and Rangpur. For more locations see List of settlements in Bangladesh.\nReligion.\nThe main religion in Bangladesh is Islam at (91.57%), while the second largest religion is Hinduism at (7.26%).\"\" Most Muslims in Bangladesh are Sunni. Islam was made the state religion in the 1980s. Buddhists and Christians together make up 1% of the population.\nBangladesh have a population of 174.3 million as per 2021 census official survey.\nCulture.\nThe earliest literary text in Bengali is the 8th century Charyapada. Medieval Bengali literature was often either religious or from other languages. The 19th century had poets such as Rabindranath Tagore, Michael Madhusudan Dutt and Kazi Nazrul Islam.\nThe musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based with few instruments. Folk music is often accompanied by the ektara, an instrument with only one string. Bangladeshi dance forms are from folk traditions.\nBangladesh makes about 80 films a year. Mainstream Hindi films are also quite popular. Around 200 daily newspapers are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 500 magazines.\nRice and fish are traditional favorite foods. Biryani is a favorite dish of Bangladeshis.\nThe sari is popularly worn by Bangladeshi women. The salwar kameez (shaloar kamiz) is also commonly worn.

It existed in one of three forms from 1918 to 2006. Yugoslavia means land of the south Slavs. It derives from those who came in the 7th century.from the area that is now Poland.\nFrom 1918 until 1928 it was called the \"Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes\". From 1928 until World War II it was the \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\". After WWII it was renamed to the \"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" with six republics, 2 autonomous provinces: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia and two autonomous provinces in Serbia: Vojvodina in the north, and Kosovo, next to Albania. \nIn 1991, came the independence of Slovenia, Croatia, in 1992, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, causing the end of the country. Serbia and Montenegro, were the last two republics in the Socialist Yugoslavia. In 1992, they formed a new \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" (FRY) which fell in 2006\nKingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1945).\nIn 1903 the Serbian king was murdered and replaced with Peter I. After this Serbia became more nationalist. Tensions with Austria-Hungary heightened when it conquered Bosnia in 1908. During this period Serbia managed to extend its borders and capture Kosovo and North Macedonia from the Ottoman Empire. Many Serbian nationalists wanted to create a unified state for the Slavs of the Balkans. Covert gangs attempted to assassinate Austro-Hungarian officials, like the Bosnian governor. In June 1914 a Bosnian Serb called Gavrilo Princip killed Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Bosnia. This event eventually led to the outbreak of the Great War (World War One).\nYugoslavia came into existence in 1918 after World War I. The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which came from of a part of Austria-Hungary, joined with the Kingdom of Serbia. The King of Serbia became the king of the new country. Southern territories of Yugoslavia were taken by Serbia from the Ottoman Empire during the Balkan Wars (1912-13). \nFor ten years it was known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It began using the name 'Yugoslavia' in 1929. The name 'Yugoslavia' is Serbo-Croatian for 'Land of the Southern Slavs'. The Kingdom was invaded by axis powers in 1941 and quickly fell during World War II. A Federal Democratic Republic was declared in 1943 with the King's approval, but the monarchy was abolished shortly after.\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945-1992).\nA People's republic was created in 1945 by a newly established communist government. It was ruled by Josip Tito from then until 1980. The country renamed itself SFR Yugoslavia in 1963. It was made up of six individual Socialist Republics: SR Croatia, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SR Macedonia, SR Montenegro, SR Serbia and SR Slovenia. The SFR Yugoslavia was different to other socialist states of the Cold War, deciding to keep itself out of it. Yugoslavia was the only socialist state to have open borders and allowed Yugoslavs and tourists to freely move around the country. Yugoslavia also kept warm relations with the West. It was also an enemy of the Soviet Union after the Tito-Stalin split as Stalin considered him a traitor. In 1968 the Soviet Union invaded socialist Czechoslovakia to stop its leader from making the country more free. Tito told the Czechoslovak leader that he was willing to fly to Prague to help him face the Soviets if he wanted.\nThe Yugoslav republics began turning against one another in the 1970s and 1980s. Josip Tito ruled Yugoslavia with an iron fist and crushed any nationalist movements that wanted to see the country break up. His government forced the six republics to stay part of Yugoslavia. When he died in 1980, the new leaders were less strict and let nationalist feelings to grow in the republics of Yugoslavia. The breakup was caused by many things like nationalism, economic difficulty and ethnic problems. The Socialist state was dissolved in 1992 during the Yugoslav wars. Serbia and Montenegro stayed together as FR Yugoslavia.\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia/Serbia &amp; Montenegro (1992-2006).\nAfter the dissolution of the SFR Yugoslavia only Serbia and Montenegro were willing to remain in union. They renamed themselves the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992. The country was led by the controversial statesman Slobodan Milosevic from 1996 until 2000. He was widely accused of having his opposition assassinated in 2000. Yugoslavia applied for UN membership in October 2000 and was granted the following month. For most of its existence the country was involved with what was called the Yugoslav Wars. There was much ethnic violence including mass genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995) and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo (1998). It was the worst acts of war seen in Europe since World War II. The country was bombed by NATO forces in 1999 during the Kosovo war. In the late 1990s separatism was growing in Yugoslavia and the country dropped the name Yugoslavia in favour of a state union in 2003. Serbia and Montenegro became independent states in 2006, formally ending the last remaining parts of Yugoslavia\nNow, Yugoslavia has been split up and made into these countries:"}
{"id": "15798", "revid": "217159", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15798", "title": "Major League Baseball", "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball league in North America. It is often considered to be the highest level of professional baseball in the world. There are two leagues that make up the MLB: the American League, also called AL, and National League, also called NL. There are currently 30 teams in the MLB, 29 from the United States and one from Canada, the Toronto Blue Jays.\nThe official website of MLB is known as \"MLB.com\" (www.mlb.com).\nMajor League Format.\nThe 30 teams in MLB are divided into two leagues: American and National. Each league is divided into three divisions: East, Central, West. Since the 2013 season, each division has had five teams. The most recent change took place after the 2012 season, when the Houston Astros moved from the NL Central to the AL West.\nEach team in Major League Baseball is scheduled to play a 162-game season. The season begins in April (or sometimes the end of March) and ends in October. The teams play other teams in their own division the most, and play very few (no more than six) games against teams in the other league. Teams usually play each other in series of three or four games at a time. If a game is canceled because of bad weather, it may be held later, sometimes as part of a doubleheader (two games in one day). Sometimes these games are not held again if it would not affect either team's place in the standings (the list of teams ordered by their number of wins and losses). \nHighest ranking teams after this regular season enter a post-season of \"playoff\" games. Teams that are tied at the end of a season may play another game to decide which team(s) will enter the playoffs. The playoff games determine the champion for each of the two leagues.\nIn July, there are three days where teams do not play normal games, and a group of the best players play in the \"Major League Baseball All-Star Game\". This period is called the \"All-Star Break\", and it is thought of as the point where half of the season is over. Some games at the beginning of the regular season have been played in other countries, such as Japan.\nThere is one difference between games played in the American League and games played in the National League. The American League teams play with a \"designated hitter\", a player who bats in place of the pitcher and does not play in the field. In the National League, the pitcher must bat along with the other players. In games played in teams from both leagues, the rule that the home team usually plays by is used.\nPlayoffs.\nAt the end of every season, ten teams play in the playoffs. Five teams from the AL, and five teams from the NL are in the playoffs. The team from the West, Central, or East division from each league with the most wins makes the playoffs (a team with the best record in its division is said to have \"won its division\"). The next two best teams in the AL and the next two best teams in the NL also get to play in the playoffs. They are called \"wild card\" teams. The first playoff round is called the Wild Card game. The two wild card teams from each league play each other in a one-game playoff. The winner of each game moves on to the Division Series. The team with the best record in each league plays the winner of its league's Wild Card game. The division winner with the second best record plays against the division winner with the third best record. \nIn the Division Series, teams play \"best out of 5\". Once one team beats the other three times, the winning team moves onto the next round of the playoffs, the Championship Series. The teams that lose are out of the playoffs. The AL teams that win play in the AL Championship Series. The NL teams that win play in the NL Championship Series. The Championship series is \"best out of 7 games\". Once one team beats the other four times, the winning team moves onto the next round of the playoffs. After the Championship Series, there are only two teams left.\nWorld Series.\nThese two teams play each other in the World Series, which is also a \"best out of 7 games\" series. The winner of the World Series is the champion of the league.\nHistory.\nThe first league of professional baseball teams began in 1871 and was called the National Association. This league did not play baseball the same way MLB does. For example, batters would walk after nine pitches instead of four. Many of the teams had problems with money and split up after only one or two seasons. However two teams are still playing today. Those teams were the Boston Red Stockings, which today are the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago White Stockings, which today are the Chicago Cubs. \nIn 1876, the National League began, and included the Red and White Stockings as well as six other teams. This league was run better, but many teams still would split up after only a few seasons. Some, like the teams that are now called the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants, are also still playing today. There were other leagues also. The American Association started in 1882 and was almost as good as the National League. However many of its teams would go to the National League, and the American Association disappeared in 1891. The National League had problems, though. Players and fans did not behave well, and in 1894 a fire started during a game and destroyed the stadium and part of Roxbury, Boston.\nTeams.\n\"A star (*) means a relocation of a franchise.

He played with the Yankees for most of his playing time which started in 1923 and ended in 1939. He played in 2,130 games without a rest, which was the most of any player until Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1995. When he stopped playing as well, he went to a doctor who found out Gehrig had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS \u2013 which is now sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease). The doctor told Gehrig he had only a short time to live. On July 4, 1939, there was a celebration of Gehrig by the other Yankees, and Gehrig gave a speech that became well-known. When he spoke that day he said he was \"the luckiest man on the face of the earth\". The mayor of New York City congratulated him for his teamwork.

Every U.S. state elects two people to represent them in the US Senate. These people are called senators. Since there are 50 US states, there are 100 senators. Senators only serve six years at a time, and one-third of them are picked every two years. Originally the legislature of each state decided who their senators would be. After 1913, all the people of the state chose their senators by vote. The Vice President of the United States is in charge of the Senate, but only does anything when there is a tie vote or a special event.\nIn order to be a senator, a person has to be 30 years old or older, and has to be a citizen of the United States for 9 years or more. They must also live in the state they represent at election time.\nFunctions.\nThe Senate, along with the United States House of Representatives, votes on which laws the United States should have. In most cases, both of these groups have to agree on the suggested law and the President has to sign it before it becomes a law.\nThe Senate is the side of Congress where every state has the same number of votes (two). This is different from the House of Representatives, where states with more people have more votes than states with fewer people. This was decided at the Constitutional Convention, because small states like Delaware did not want the larger states to be able to decide everything. Also, only part of the Senate runs for election during elections. Every two years, 33 (two elections) or 34 (one election) senators are elected. For each state, this means that after two elections to the Senate, during one election no one will be elected to the Senate.\nAlso, like the House, the Senate can override the president's veto with a \u2154 (67 votes) vote. But unlike the house, some bills require a 3/5 (60 votes) vote (it used to be \u2154 of the vote) to overcome the filibuster. A filibuster is when senators band together, they can stop bills from going through the senate.\nThe United States Senate was formerly the upper chamber of the United States Congress, which, along with the United States House of Representatives \u2015 the lower chamber \u2015 comprised the legislature of the United States.\nConfirmation powers.\nThe Senate is also in charge of agreeing to treaties with other countries. The Senate has the sole responsibility for confirming presidential appointments. These include federal judges, foreign ambassadors and Cabinet members. If the Senate and President do not agree, the President has to pick someone else the Senate will agree to.\nPolitical parties.\nCommittees of the United States Senate and other important jobs in the Senate are assigned by the majority political party. Right now, the Senate is made up of 48 Democrats with 2 Independents who sides with the Democrats which make them the Senate Majority. The minority of the Senate is made up of 50 Republicans. "}

This person can let someone else own the things they make, sometimes for money. The person that owns these things has a \"copyright\" for them, which means that person can decide who can copy their work. If someone else copies that work without asking the owner first, that person is breaking the law. The owner can take the person to court and try to get money from them because of what they did.\nSince a lot of creative work is popular, people want to talk about them, and they may want to talk about them on TV or in a book. This might mean that they want to use a little bit of it when they talk about it. The idea of \"fair use\" was added to most copyright laws to make sure that it would be OK do to this, as long as only a little bit of someone's work is used.\nSoftware programs.\nSince a lot of creative work is now on computers and on the Internet, it is very easy to copy things and send them to lots of people. To make sure that people cannot always do this, there are computer programs that try to stop people from copying other people's work (known as digital rights management). One problem with these programs is that they also mean that you cannot copy even a small part of someone's work, so you cannot do \"fair use\" without cheating the program. In some countries, cheating those software programs is also breaking the law."}

It is easy and cheap to make, as all it really requires is vegetable waste. The vegetable waste is broken down by bacteria (germs), and made into compost.\nMaking a compost heap.\nTo make a compost heap, you need some space fairly far from anyone who might have a problem with the smell. The bottom corner of a garden, or some other place a distance from the house is a good place. Compost heaps should also be placed on soil, or grass: a paved yard or concrete are bad places.\nThe compost heap should not be in a dark or closed corner.\nThe best base for a compost heap is a layer of sand, bricks or gravel about 1m long by 1m wide. This is not needed, but it can be a good idea. If using bricks, leave spaces to allow the air to move through. It also allows for the water to run away. The best compost heaps have lots of little spaces inside, to allow air to move around.\nOnce the first layer is down, one can begin adding the waste. \nSome good types of waste are:\nAdding meat scraps is a bad idea, as they rot slowly, smell bad and attract rats and other vermin. Human or pet feces is also a very bad idea, as this can transmit disease. Waste from plants that have died of disease is also bad. The disease can spread to the plants that the compost is used with.\nWhen making a compost heap, different types of waste should be layered. A layer of cut grass can be followed by a layer of vegetable waste and table scraps.\nWatering the compost heap is a good idea, especially in dry areas. The water helps encourage the waste to rot and turn into compost.\nIn anywhere from 3 to 6 months, the compost will be ready. The compost is ready when it smells like thick earth, with no smell of decay or rot. Of course, if you have been adding waste all this time, the compost will all be at the bottom of the heap, and will have to be dug out.\nThe stuff that has not rotted can be used as part of a new compost heap."}

The other country on the island is the Dominican Republic. Haiti has two official languages: French and Haitian Creole, or \"Kreyol\", which is a simple version of French mixed with African languages. Its capital city is Port-au-Prince.\nHaiti has a tropical climate. In French, the country is called \"La Perle des Antilles\" (The pearl of the Antilles), because of its natural beauty. There are many mountains in Haiti. The country used to be covered with forests. However, it no longer is, because of deforestation. It is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.\nHaiti is divided into ten \"departements\". The main religion is Roman Catholicism. However, many Haitians also practice Voodoo. This is a religion which came from African folk beliefs in Benin. Haiti has many holidays; the largest and most important is the \"Mardi Gras\".\nGeography.\nHaiti has a total area of 27,750 km\u00b2. Most of it is in the western third of the Hispaniola island. There are also smaller islands near the Haitian coast, like \"Gon\u00e2ve\", \"\u00cele de la Tortue\", \"Les Cayemites\", \"\u00cele-\u00e0-Vache\" and \"La Navase\".\nHaiti has many mountains. There are only some coastal plains and few valleys. The largest valley is the \"Cul-de-Sac\". Port-au-Prince is in the western end of this valley. The country's main river is the Artibonite, which is also the longest in Hispaniola. Haiti's biggest city is Port-au-Prince, with more than 3 million people in its metropolitan area. The second largest city is Cap-Ha\u00eftien.\nHaiti has a tropical climate. The rainy season lasts from April to June, and from October to November. Hurricanes are common during summer. In the past, hurricanes have caused a lot of damage and killed many people.\nHistory.\nThe Taino people were a tribe of Arawak Amerindians. They lived on the island of Hispaniola before Christopher Columbus found the island and started a European colony there. Columbus found the island of Hispaniola on his first trip to the Americas. Within twenty-five years after Columbus arrived, all of the Arawaks had been killed by Spanish conquistadors.\nIn the early 17th century, the French set up a colony on Hispaniola. In 1697, Spain sold the western third of the island - Haiti - to the French. The French colony was based on forestry and making sugar. It became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean. However, to do this, the colony brought many slaves over from Africa and destroyed much of the environment.\nBy the late 18th century, there were nearly half a million slaves in Haiti. They revolted, led by Toussaint L'Ouverture. After a hard and bloody struggle, they won their independence. In 1804, Haiti became the first independent black republic in the world. Today there are many monuments in Haiti remembering the Haitian Revolution. One of the largest is \"La Citadelle Laferriere\".\nOn January 12, 2010, in the afternoon of a Tuesday, Haiti was struck by a magnitude-7.0 earthquake. This was the worst earthquake to hit the country in the past 200 years. The quake's epicenter was just outside the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. The quake caused major damage to Port-au-Prince and nearby areas. Over 200,000 people were thought to have been killed, but it was hard to be sure because many people were buried in mass graves before they could be identified.\nDepartments.\nHaiti is made of ten regions known as departments (, singular \"d\u00e9partment\"). These departments are further divided into 41 \"arrondissements\", and 133 \"communes\". These are the second and third level units of administration.\nThe 10 departments, with their capital cities in parentheses, are:\nPolitics.\nThe Republic of Haiti is divided into 10 departments, but the central government has control over most political affairs. The president is head of state and is normally elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The president cannot serve consecutive terms. However, because of inconclusive election results in 2015, Haiti's current interim president was elected by the legislature. The prime minister is head of government and is appointed by the president and confirmed by the bicameral National Assembly. The National Assembly's upper house is the 30-seat Senate, and the lower house is the 118-seat Chamber of Deputies. Members of both houses are elected through a majoritarian system. Senators serve six-year terms and deputies serve four-year terms. There have been efforts toward constitutional reform to ensure that more women are represented in politics on the national level, but these reforms have not yet resulted in concrete changes.\nHolidays.\nOfficial holidays (on the same day every year)\nTraditional and religious holidays (dates vary according to the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church)\nEconomy.\nHaiti is the least developed country in the Americas. It is also one of the least developed and poorest countries in the world.\nThere are indicators that can be used to compare social and economic situations between countries. Some indicators show that Haiti has fallen behind other poor developing countries since the 1980s. In 2006, Haiti ranked 146th of 177 countries in the United Nations Human Development Index (2006). About 90% of the Haitian people were living in poverty in 2003. Haiti is the only country in the Americas on the United Nations list of Least Developed Countries and it is the poorest country in the Americas. The economy was staying even or falling behind even before their big earthquake.\nAbout 66% of all Haitians work in agriculture. Most of them do small-scale subsistence farming (meaning that they are able to grow just enough to survive). This does not bring in much money.\nVery few jobs were created in the last ten years. However, the informal economy is growing. Mangoes and coffee are two of Haiti's most important exports. Haiti has consistently ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world on the Corruption Perceptions Index.\nAbout one third of the national government's budget is money given to them by other countries. The United States gives the most money. Canada gives the second largest amount of money. The European Union, Venezuela and Cuba also give and help Haiti's economy in different ways. Haiti has renewed its alliances with Venezuela and Cuba in 2006 and 2007.\nFrom 2001-2004, the United States stopped giving aid to Haiti completely. The aid was cut off after Haiti's 2000 election. The election's results were questioned, and President Aristide was accused of cheating to win the election. Aristide was overthrown in 2004. After that, the United States started giving aid to Haiti again. The United Nations led a peacekeeping operation called the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. (The Mission is called called MINUSTAH in Haiti; this is an acronym for the Mission's name in French). The Brazilian army led the peacekeeping operation.\nEven after President Aristide was overthrown, corruption continued to be very common in Haiti.\nHaiti has a large amount of foreign debt (money owed to other countries and international institutions to repay loans). The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program planned to forgive about $525 million of Haiti's debt by mid-2009.\nDemographics.\nIn 2009, the population of Haiti (the number of people living in the country) was about 10,090,190. Figures from the DNA Nationwide Studies Institute say that the racial makeup of the population is:\nSome East Asians also live in the country."}

It is the oldest university in the English-speaking world. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings said it is the best university in the world.\nThe university is 38 colleges and six private halls. All of these colleges have their own buildings and their own staff. Oxford is quite different from most modern universities where all the students live on a campus. Oxford does not have a campus, although it does have some central places where students from different colleges can come together (for example, libraries). \nThe Bodleian Library (founded in 1602) is the main library of the University of Oxford, and one of the oldest libraries in Europe. It is the second largest library in the United Kingdom after the British Library.\nHistory.\nOxford is the world's third-oldest university after the University of Bologna, and the world's second-oldest surviving university. \nThere is no known date of foundation, but there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. English students were not allowed to continue studying in Paris after Thomas Becket was murdered. \nThere were fights between the students in Oxford and the people who lived there in the early 13th century. Some students and teachers left the university in 1209, and made a new university in Cambridge. These two universities are now great rivals, and together are sometimes known as \"Oxbridge\".\nUntil 1920, women were not allowed to take degrees at Oxford, although some women studied at Oxford before that time. Nowadays, all the colleges allow both men and women as students, and the number of male and female students is roughly equal.\nOne of the most famous teachers at the university was Lewis Carroll, author of \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\", stories for children.\nColleges and halls.\nThere are 38 colleges at Oxford and 6 permanent private halls.\nA college will normally offer the students accommodation (a room to sleep and study in) for the first and last years of their time at University. Many also offer accommodation for other years. A college will also have space for teaching and socializing. When most of the older colleges started they were only for people of one sex, but St Hilda's College, the last college to allow only women to study there, recently allowed men as well.\nA permanent private hall is slightly different to a college. They were normally started by religious groups to educate their members in philosophy and theology, but some have since grown and offer a broader range of subjects. Some halls are run by monks, and one of them \u2013 St Benet's Hall \u2013 will only accept male students.\nMost colleges will teach at both undergraduate (the more basic first degree that a student takes) and postgraduate (a higher level of study) level. There are also some special colleges that are more restrictive. Five colleges only offer space to postgraduate students. Harris Manchester College is only for \"mature students\" (those who are over 21 when they start their degree). All Souls College does not take students \u2013 all of its members teach students or do research.\nGetting into Oxford.\nOxford, like Cambridge, is very popular, but there are only a limited number of spaces for students. It is therefore harder for students to get into these universities. The colleges look for the students with the best school results in the subjects for which they are applying, typically A marks on A-levels."}

They formed in Sheffield, England in 1977. Its founding members include: lead singer Joe Elliot, bassist Rick Savage, guitarist Pete Willis, and drummer Tony Kenning. When Kenning was fired from the band in 1978, he was replaced by Frank Noon. The same year, Def Leppard had their first recording. They recorded \"The Def Leppard EP\". Frank Noon was replaced by drummer Rick Allen the same year and guitarist Steve Clark joined the band shortly after. They played their first show at Westfield School in Sheffield in the same year.\nTheir first album, \"On Through the Night\" (1980), was a hit in many parts of England. In April 1980, Def Leppard signed with Leber Krebs management. In the same year they went of their first U.S. tour with Ted Nugent, AC/DC, and Judas Priest. In 1981 the band released their second album, \"High \u2018n\u2019 Dry\". At that time, MTV aired Def Leppard for the first time. MTV aired their hit \u201cBringin\u2019 on the Heartbreak.\u201d \nIn 1982, Pete Willis was replaced by Phil Collen. The same year, the recording with Mutt Lange for their third album takes place. In 1983, their third album \"Pyromania\" is released. The single \u201cPhotograph\u201d was released and the album sells 100,000 copies a week for that year. In 1984, drummer Rick Allen suffers the loss of an arm due to a car accident. He soon mastered an electronic drum kit and teaches himself how to play with one arm. In 1986, Rick Allen plays his first gig out with the band since his accident. In 1987, the band\u2019s fourth album, \u201cHysteria\u201d is released. The album has 12 hit singles and sells 16 million copies. \nIn 1991, guitarist Steve Clark passes away. His death was due to a mixture of alcohol and a drug overdose of prescription pain killers. In 1992 Vivian Campbell joins the band. Vivian Campbell was the former guitarist for Dio and Whitesnake. That year, the album \u201cAdrenalize\u201d is released. This album remains number one for five weeks and sells six million copies.\nIn 1993 the band has their first expirence having their music in movies. Their song \u201cTwo Steps Behind\u201d was used for the end credits of \u201cLast Action Hero\u201d. The same year the album \u201cRetro Active\u201d is released. In 1995 \u201cThe Vault\u201d is released. It is a compilation of all of Def Leppard\u2019s biggest hits. \u201cThe Vault\u201d hits number two on the charts. In 1996, the album \u201cSlang\u201d is released.\nIn 1998, Def Leppard had their first taste of TV. VH1 produced a \u201cBehind the Music\u201d episode on Def Leppard. Other TV exposure followed such as \u201cStorytellers\u201d, and \u201cUltimate Albums.\u201d In 1999, they receive the Diamond Award in the U.S. Also in 1999, the album \u201cEuphoria\u201d is released.

The warm, wet air mass and the cold air mass can each be or more in diameter. Snowstorms affecting Northeastern United States often get their moisture from air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico and cold air from air masses coming down from the Arctic. In the Northwest United States warm, wet air from the Pacific Ocean cools when it is pushed upward by the mountains. Many different things can affect the direction of movement, moisture content and temperature of air masses. All of these differences affect the type and severity of the snowstorm.\nWinter storms and blizzards can make several meters of snow that blow into big drifts. Sometimes the drifts can be over tall. They could even cover a house.\nHistory.\nLots of popular winter storms are part of North America's history. In 1846 the Donner Party traveled away by covered wagons from Illinois headed for Sutter's Fort near Sacramento, California. As an answer of bad decisions and slow going, they tried to go across the big Sierra Nevada Mountains in the late October. Usually, California is still warm at that time of the year. As the party crossed the Sierra Nevada Mountains, they did not see any snow and was not worried.\nHowever, after they left, a huge snowstorm hit. The party was forced to camp near Truckee, California. The snow was so deep that the wagon wheels became stuck, so they could not move anyplace. They tried to wait the storm out, but when one blizzard ended, another began immediately before they had time to escape.\nTheir food became short, so some of the people decided to hike out and find help rather than to starve to death. Most of them died in the freezing weather, and many of those who stayed behind in the camp survived. Of the 87 people who started in Illinois, only 47 lived."}

The capital of the country is Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte while the largest city is Colombo.\nIt was known as Ceylon before 1972, and Serendib and Sinhale, among other names, before that. It was South Asia's oldest democracy.\nEthnic make-up.\nSri Lanka has three main ethnic groups. They differ in their religions and origins, and there has often been difficulties between the groups. The total population of the island is over 20 million people, and rapidly expanding.\nThe largest of the three groups is the population of Sinhalese people. Most of them are Buddhist. Their language is Sinhala. They make up about 75% of the population.\nThe second largest group is the Tamil people. They are Hindu. There are about 2,271,000 Tamils in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Civil War against Tamil separatists lasted 28 years.\nThe third largest group is the Sri Lankan Moors. They are Muslim. There are over one and a half million people in this group. They use Tamil as their language today.\nOther than these three main groups, there are burghers (descendants of colonial ancestors), malays and chinese.\nIn areas such as Dabana , Mahiyangaya ; lives the indigenous group called 'veddas' who are said to descend from Kuweni and Vijaya's son 'Jeewahaththa'.\nHistory.\nBuddhist missionaries arrived from India in 250 BC during the time period of King Devanampiyatissa. The kings of the island, and eventually most of the Sinhalese people, became Buddhists. Legend has it that Buddha visited the island three times.\nThe island was subject to waves of European settlement and eventually colonisation. The Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries, and lastly the British from 1796 to 1948. The British traded as the others had done, but also developed plantations of coffee and tea. Tea was planted after a fungus destroyed the coffee plantations in 1869. The tea plantations were the basis of Sri Lankan prosperity for a hundred years. Lastly, rubber plantations were started in the early 20th century. In 1965, Ceylon became the world's leading exporter of tea, with 200,000 tonnes of tea being shipped internationally annually.\nIndependence from the British was got in 1948, together with Dominion status in the British Commonwealth of Nations. In 1972, Ceylon changed its name officially to the Republic of Sri Lanka, and is still a member of the Commonwealth.\nIn 2009 came the end of a long Sri Lankan Civil War between Sinhalese and Tamils. Since then tourism has rapidly grown as a source of foreign investment and currency.\nFlag.\nThe Sri Lanka flag is also known as the Lion flag because of the Lion on it. The Lion is holding a sword in its right paw. There is a crimson background with four leaves in each corner. There is a yellow border. On the left of the flag there are the colors green and saffron.\nThe lion represents bravery. The four leaves represent Karuna, Meththa, Muditha and Upeksha. The orange stripe represents the Sri Lankan Tamils and the green stripe represents the Sri Lankan Moors.\nProvinces.\nSri Lanka has 9 provinces.\nEaster Sunday bombings.\nOn April 21, 2019, bombings hit churches and hotels and left at least 290 people dead and 500 injured in the cities of \ncities of Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. According to officials a Sri Lankan group called \"National Thowheed Jamath\" was behind the attacks.\nMost of those killed were Sri Lankan nationals, but there were also thirty-one foreigners who died, including\neight British, eight Indian, two Turkish, two Australian, one Bangladeshi, one Portuguese and four American nationals."}
{"id": "15887", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15887", "title": "Reptile", "text": "Reptile is the common name for one of the main groups of land vertebrates. It is not used so much by biologists, who use more accurate terms.\nThe name \"reptile\" comes from Latin and means \"one who creeps\". All living reptile species are cold blooded, have scaly skin, and lay cleidoic eggs. They excrete uric acid (instead of urea), and have a cloaca. A cloaca is a shared opening for the anus, urinary tract and reproductive ducts. Reptiles also share an arrangement of the heart and major blood vessels which is different from that of mammals.\nMany important groups of reptiles are now extinct, for example the mosasaurs. We used to say the dinosaurs were extinct, but they survive in the form of their feathered descendants (birds). Ancient reptiles that do survive include the turtles, the crocodiles and the Tuatara, the lone survivor of its group. The great majority of present-day reptiles are snakes and lizards.\nThe study of living reptiles is called \"herpetology\".\nBirds in relation to reptiles.\nSome reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles. Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards. Theropod dinosaurs are even more closely related, because birds evolved from them.\nCladistic writers prefer a more unified (monophyletic) grouping. This puts the birds (over 10,000 species) with what people normally call reptiles. (see Sauropsida)\nTaxonomy.\nReptilia is an evolutionary grade rather than a clade. The main reason is that the term 'reptile' does not include birds, the descendents of theropod dinosaurs. Another reason is that the word 'reptile' is misleading because many extinct types were very different from living reptiles.\nSo instead of Reptilia as a taxonomic class, today many experts use Class Sauropsida (which includes all reptiles and birds, living and extinct). Class Synapsida includes mammals and all their forebears. \"Reptile\" is still the usual informal term to describe living snakes and lizards. Mammals are a genuine clade, and so Mammalia is still the taxonomic term.\nSince reptiles are not monophyletic, reclassifying them is one of the key aims of researchers. Some taxonomists, such as Benton, make Sauropsida and Synapsida as class-level taxa. The two groups split in the Carboniferous, from stem-group Amniotes (the early tetrapods, which laid cleidoic eggs).\nEye feature.\nA membrane forms an inner eyelid in reptiles and birds. Whitish or translucent, it can be drawn across the eye to protect it from dust and keep it moist. It is called the \"nictitating membrane\".\nSize.\nReptiles can live in large and small sizes. Their land sizes can be both bigger and smaller than mammals. Titanosaurs were the largest land reptiles, and the smallest land reptile is a chameleon 13.5mm long."}
{"id": "15890", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15890", "title": "Snake", "text": "Snakes are reptiles. They are part of the order Squamata. They are carnivores, with long narrow bodies and no legs. There are at least 20 families, about 500 genera and 3,400 species of snake.\nThe earliest known fossils are from the Jurassic period. This was between 143 and 167 million years ago.\nTheir long, slender body has some special features. They have overlapping scales which protect them, and help them move and climb trees. The scales have colours which may be camouflage or warning colours. \nMany species have skulls with more joints than the skulls of their lizard ancestors. This allows the snakes to swallow prey much larger than their heads. In their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side. Most have only one working lung. Some species have kept a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. They have no eyelids or external ears. They can hiss, but otherwise make no vocal sounds.\nThey are very mobile in their own way. Most of them live in the tropics. Few snake species live beyond the Tropic of Cancer or Tropic of Capricorn, and only one species, the common viper (\"Vipera berus\") lives beyond the Arctic Circle. They can see well enough, and they can taste scents with their tongues by flicking them in and out. They are very sensitive to vibrations in the ground. Some snakes can sense warm-blooded animals by thermal infrared.\nMost snakes live on the ground, and in the trees. Others live in the water, and a few live under the soil. Like other reptiles, snakes are ectotherms. They control their body temperature by moving in and out of the direct sunshine. That is why they are rare in cold places.\nSnakes range in size from the tiny, 10.4\u00a0cm (4\u00a0inch)-long thread snake to the reticulated python of in length. The extinct snake \"Titanoboa\" was long.\nEvolution.\nSnakes are thought to have evolved from lizards. The earliest snake fossils are from the Lower Cretaceous. A wide range of snakes appeared during the Paleocene period (\"c\" 66 to 56 million years ago).\nNot a clade.\nThe Squamata are definitely a monophyletic group: it is a sister group to the Tuatara. Judged by their fossil record, the squamates were present in the Mesozoic, but had a minor place in the land ecology. Three of the six lines are recorded first in the Upper Jurassic, the others in the Cretaceous. Probably all, certainly the lizards, arose earlier in the Jurassic. The Mosasaurs of the Upper Cretaceous were by far the most successful of all the lizards, becoming the top predator in their ecosystem.\nAlthough snakes and lizards look very different, \"neither is a proper clade\". Snakes did descend from early lizards, not once, but a number of times.\nThere is a monophyletic clade within the Squamata. It is the Toxicofera. It includes all venomous snakes and lizards, and many related non-venomous species. The evidence for this is in recent molecular analyses.\nFossil snakes.\nThe fossil of a primitive snake from the Lower Cretaceous has been found. It lived about 113 million years ago. It had rather small front and rear legs. Several other fossil snakes have been found with small rear legs, but this is the first one with all four legs. The snake, \"Tetrapodophis amplectus\", lived on land and was adapted to burrowing. The researcher said there were \"a lot of very advanced snake features, including its hooked teeth, flexible jaw and spine \u2013 and even snake-like scales. And there's the gut contents \u2013 it's swallowed another vertebrate. It was preying on other animals, which is a snake feature\". The snake came from the Crato Formation in Brazil, and lay in a private collection for many years. It was re-discovered in a museum at Solnhofen, Bavaria.\nVenom.\nMost snakes are nonvenomous. Those that have venom use it mainly to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some have venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by squeezing.\nTwo taxonomic families are entirely venomous:\nA third family with the \"rear-fanged\" snakes (and most of the other snake species) is the\nAnatomy.\nMany snakes have skulls with more joints than their lizard ancestors. This helps them swallow prey much larger than their heads. The bones of the head and jaws can move apart to let large prey move into their body. The throat, stomach and intestines can also expand in a most extraordinary manner. In this was, a thin-looking snake can swallow and digest a larger animal.\nTo fit their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) are one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most snakes have only one working lung. Some species have a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. This is a relic of the legs which do not appear in modern snakes.\nShedding.\nSnakes need to shed their skin regularly while they grow. This is called moulting. Snakes shed their skin by rubbing their head against something rough and hard, like a piece of wood or a rock. This causes the skin, which is already stretched, to split open. The snake keeps on rubbing its skin on various rough objects until the skin peels off from its head. This lets it crawl out, turning the skin inside out.\nFeeding.\nAll snakes are carnivorous; they eat other animals. Some are venomous; they inject poison along grooves in their teeth. Some snakes are constrictrors. Constrictors are not venomous, so they squeeze their prey to death. Snakes swallow their food whole, and they cannot chew. Because snakes are cold-blooded, they do not have to eat as regularly as mammals. People who own pet snakes feed them as infrequently as once per month. Some snakes can go as long as six months without a good meal.\nSnakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and many other joints in their skull. They can open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole, even if the prey is larger in diameter than the snake itself.\nMovement.\nNot having arms and legs doesn't stop snakes from moving. They have developed several different ways of moving to deal with particular environments. Each type of snake movement is discrete and distinct from the others.\nLateral undulation.\nLateral undulation is a snake's only way of moving in water, and the most common way of moving altogether. In this mode, the body of the snake alternately bends to the left and right, resulting in a series of rearward-moving \"waves\". While this movement appears rapid, snakes have rarely been seen moving faster than two body-lengths per second, often much less. This mode of movement has the same amount of calories burned per meter moved as running in lizards of the same mass.\nTerrestrial.\nTerrestrial lateral undulation is the most common mode of moving for most snake species. In this mode, the posteriorly moving waves push against contact points in the environment, such as rocks, twigs, irregularities in the soil, etc. Each of these environmental objects, in turn, generates a reaction force directed forward and towards the midline of the snake, resulting in forward thrust while the lateral components cancel out. The speed of this movement depends upon the density of push-points in the environment, with a medium density of about 8 along the snake's length being ideal. The wave speed is precisely the same as the snake speed, and as a result, every point on the snake's body follows the path of the point ahead of it, allowing snakes to move through very dense vegetation and small openings.\nAquatic.\nSnakes move forward in water by moving their bodies in a wave-like motion. The waves become larger as they move down the snake's body, and the wave travels backwards faster than the snake moves forwards. Thrust is got by pushing their body against the water: this results in the observed slip. In spite of overall similarities, studies show that the pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes. All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).\nSidewinding.\nThis is most often used by colubroid snakes (colubrids, elapids, and vipers). They use it when the environment lacks anything firm to push against, such as a slick mud flat, or a sand dune. Sidewinding is a modified form of lateral undulation in which all of the body segments oriented in one direction remain in contact with the ground, while the other segments are lifted up. This results in a peculiar \"rolling\" motion. This mode of moving overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body, thereby minimizing slipping. The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing. This mode of moving has very low caloric cost, less than \u2153 of the cost for a lizard or normal snake to move the same distance.\nConcertina.\nWhen push-points are absent, but the space is too narrow for sidewinding, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on concertina moving. In this mode, the snake braces the back part of its body against the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens. The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the back part is straightened and pulled forwards. This mode of moving is slow and very demanding, needing up to seven times the energy of laterally undulating over the same distance. This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the need to use the muscles to brace against the tunnel walls.\nRectilinear.\nThe slowest mode of snake moving is rectilinear moving, which is also the only one where the snake does not need to bend its body laterally, though it may do so when turning. In this mode, the belly scales are lifted and pulled forward before being placed down and the body pulled over them. Waves of movement and stasis pass posteriorly, resulting in a series of ripples in the skin. The ribs of the snake do not move in this mode of moving and this method is most often used by large pythons, boas, and vipers when stalking prey across open ground as the snake's movements are subtle and harder to detect by their prey in this manner.\nOther.\nThe movement of snakes in trees has only recently been studied. While on tree branches, snakes use several modes of moving depending on species and bark texture. In general, snakes will use a modified form of concertina moving on smooth branches, but will laterally undulate if contact points are available. Snakes move faster on small branches and when contact points are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'.\nGliding snakes (\"Chrysopelea\") of Southeast Asia launch themselves from branch tips, spreading their ribs and laterally undulating as they glide between trees. These snakes can perform a controlled glide for hundreds of feet depending upon launch altitude and can even turn in midair."}

Regarded as one of the greatest lead singers in popular music history, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Killer Queen\", \"Somebody to Love\", \"Don't Stop Me Now\", \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", and \"We Are the Champions\". He led a solo career while performing with Queen, and occasionally served as a producer and guest musician for other artists.\nHe formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May, bassist John Deacon and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease. In 1992, Mercury was posthumously awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and a tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium, London. As a member of Queen, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2002, he was placed number 58 in the BBC's 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He is consistently voted one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music.\nLife and career.\nChildhood.\nFreddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara on 5 September 1946 in Stone Town in the British protectorate of the Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania). His parents were Jer and Bomi Bulsara. They were both Parsi. His father worked as a cashier in the British Colonial Office, a branch of the government. Mercury had a younger sister named Kashmira. His friends at school gave him the name \"Freddie.\" His family then began calling him Freddie, too.\nAt age eight, Mercury was sent to a boarding school in India. The school, St. Peters English Boarding school in Panchgani, was about 50 miles outside the city of Bombay (now called Mumbai). He began to show talent as an artist and a sportsman. At age ten, he was named the school champion of Table Tennis. When he was twelve, he received a trophy called the Junior All-rounder.\nMusic career, personal life, and death.\nWhile in school he joined a choir and began to learn to play the piano. He had a four-octave vocal range.\nIn 1964, Mercury moved to London with his family. He studied art at Ealing Art College. While in London, he became fond of Mary Austin, a woman he met through his guitarist, Brian May. They lived together for several years before and after the band became famous. They moved into a house in London nicknamed \"The Court of King Freddie\". Mary still lived in that house after she and Mercury broke up.\nMercury was in love with a local barber when he died. He had been with him in a relationship for six years when it was learned by the media that Mercury had AIDS, which he was tested positive for in 1987. One day after the news was broadcast, Mercury died of Bronchopneumonia caused by AIDS on 24 November 1991 at the age of 45. "}

He is widely believed to have been the author of the most important work of military strategy and theory, \"The Art of War\". His name means 'Master Sun'. His family name is Sun, Tzu is an honorific (title of respect) meaning 'master'.\nMost of what we know about Sun Tzu comes from Ssu-ma Ch'ien's \"Shih chi\", also called the Records of the Grand Historian. According to the Grand Historian, Sun Tzu lived during the period called 'The Spring and Autumn Period of China'. This era dates from 770 BC to 476 BC.\nLife.\nSun Tzu was born in the State of Qi (modern Shandong province). This is according to the Records of the Grand Historian. However, the \"Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yueh\" claim he was born in Wu. Sun Tzu lived during the turbulent period of the late Chou dynasty. He grew up in a military family and he studied military science. Not much is known about his childhood or early life. It is known that at some point in his life he became known as a great general and a military strategist. He became a general for King Hel\u00fc of Wu.\nSun Tzu won battles by not actually fighting his enemy when it wasn't necessary. He recommended spies, deception and a commander having complete control of his soldiers. When he did fight, he understood warfare better than most of his opponents. Sun Tzu learned to win battles with the least loss of his own men.\nMany historians believe he was the victor at the Battle of Boju in 506 BC. The great historian Sima Qian (145/135\u201386 BC), author of \"Shiji\" (Historical Record), called Sun Tzu an exceptional strategic battlefield commander. He also said Sun Tzu was both flexible and had unlimited surprises for his enemies. Sima Qian wrote that in his nearly 40-years as a general, Sun Tzu never lost a battle, a campaign or a war.\nThe Art of War.\nThe Art of War was one of the earliest books on Chinese warfare. It remains one of the best known and most influential books ever written. The book was widely copied in the ancient world. An early copy was discovered in 1972. It was written on bamboo slats that were sewn together. It became known in the western world during the late 18th century. It wasn't translated into English until the 20th century.\nAt that time the rules for warfare were based on chivalry. War was the sport of rich noblemen. Sun Tzu refused to see war as a sport. He used Taoist principles and applied them to warfare. In doing this he changed the rules of war. Unlike generals who enjoyed long campaigns, he understood war was serious. Sun Tzu believed that once a war started, the goal was to defeat the enemy. Sun Tzu was unconventional in that he didn't follow the prevailing wisdom of his time. Other generals were simply unprepared for Sun Tzu's tactics.\nLegacy.\nFor at least the last two thousand years, Sun Tzu has had a tremendous influence on military thinking. The Art of War is credited by Mao Zedong as having helped him defeat Chiang Kai-Shek in the Chinese Civil War. Ho Chi Minh was a fan of Sun Tzu. He led the Communist Vietnamese in their fight against American-backed South Vietnam. American generals Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. and Colin Powell followed principals in the Art of War in the Gulf War.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

In some places, certain kinds of field mice are also common. They are known to invade homes for food and occasionally shelter.\nThese small animals are often used in science experiments, or sometimes kept as pets. Some mice carry diseases. In some places they damage crops. This causes some people to think of mice as vermin or pests. Many other people think mice are cute and fun animals. \nMice are rodents, therefore they are related to squirrels, rats, and beavers. Mice eat weeds, seeds, berries, and more. They are eaten by owls, foxes, and cats, amongst others.\nTypes of mice.\nThe word \"mouse\" should only be used for small murines, but does get used for other distantly-related small rodents.

It is a strategy game: players must think of ways to win.\nThe game can be played with two, three, or four players at a time. Each player takes turns controlling their military-style playing pieces, called \"units.\" Every unit can move along the playing field, which is split up into squares. The amount of squares a unit can move in one turn is different for each unit.\nMost units can attack other units. Each unit has its own strength and defense. Strength is how much damage the unit can do to another unit. Defense is how much damage it can avoid taking whenever it is attacked. For example, the tank unit has more defense than the soldier, so even though the helicopter always has the same amount of attacking power, it can do more damage to the soldier than the tank."}

(Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, two research papers say that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.\nIn 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying part of the capital's Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A motion of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government.

Using what chemists know about the way chemicals act, we add the letter symbols together just like a math problem. In this way we can correctly guess if we will get a new chemical when we mix two or more chemicals together, and what that chemical will be.\nChemical equations are either worded or written using the elements' symbols, how much of the element and in what state (solid[s], liquid[l], gas[g]) it is in.\nFor example: An aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl[aq]) and another aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3[aq]). These mixed together form sodium nitrate (NaNO3[aq]) and silver chloride (AgCl[s])\nWhich in symbols is:\nNaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) \u2192 NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)\nThe solutions formed the solid AgCl. This formation can be called a precipitate and the reaction between the two solutions a precipitation reaction, because the solid produced is not dissolved, whereas all the other products are dissolved.\nMore about chemical equations.\nChemical equations need to be balanced to satisfy the law of conservation of matter. Chemical equations tell that in a closed system matter is neither created nor destroyed. The chemical equation needs to be balanced so that it follows the law of conservation of mass. A balanced chemical equation happens when the number of the different atoms of elements on the reactants side is equal to that of the products side. \nBalancing chemical equations is a process of trial and error. To balance the equation, the amounts of the reactants and products must be changed. As necessary, by adding coefficients in front of the appropriate formulas. When balancing an equation, never change the subscripts, because that changes the substance. To determine the number of atoms of each element, the coefficient is multiplied times the subscripts in each formula.\nMethods of balancing chemical equations.\nA chemical equation is a written symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. The reactant chemicals are given on the left-hand side and the product chemical on the right-hand side. The law of conservation of mass says that no atoms can be made in a chemical reaction. Also, it cannot be destroyed. So the number of atoms that are present in the reactants has to balance the number of atoms that are present in the reaction. \nThere are two practices of balancing a chemical equation. The first one is balancing by Inspection. Balancing by inspection is the most basic method used. It works best for simple problems. More complicated ones require experience. The second one is Balancing by Numerical Method. The most important parts of the numerical methotrexate, contrary to the inspection method, it gives the answer. If the reaction can be balanced, coefficients can be seen. If the reaction can't be balanced, it means that there are more unidentified than independent statements, or that statements are opposite. With inspection method, it won't prove that the equation can't be balanced.\nwhy do we need to balance a chemical equation?\n\"we need to balance a chemical equation because \"law of conservation of mass\"\" state that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. \nSo number of elements involved in a chemical reaction should remain same at reactant and product side."}

They could be made from wood, stone, or brick, and some were used for hundreds of years. Thousands of castles were built across Europe, the Middle East, and Japan with different designs. Today, most castles are ruins and many are popular tourist attractions.\nIn England and Wales castles were first used by the invading Normans led by Duke William in 1066. They provided a base for lord of the castle to control the surrounding area and govern their land. Castles were designed to be imposing: their massive defenses deterred attackers and showed the owner's strength.\nA few troops in a castle could defend themselves against a much larger army. The most common method for taking a castle would be to besiege or storm it. Each had problems. Storming a castle would kill many of the attackers, but a siege would take a long time. Both methods sometimes failed.\nTime of building.\nCastles were first built in the 9th century and the practice continued up to the 16th century. A castle was both a home for someone important like a king or noble, and a fort. Castles were designed to keep people out and show how powerful the people inside were. They were sometimes used in war, with many famous sieges like the siege of Kenilworth in 1266 which lasted for six months, or Stirling Castle which was besieged eight times.\nCastles could look very strong, but sometimes the defences were mostly for show. The moat around Bodiam Castle is not very deep and could be drained by an attacking army, so was not very practical as a defence. But it made the castle look very impressive, and look bigger than it really is. If the owner of a castle rebelled against their ruler they might be punished by having their castle demolished, known as slighting.\nWhere to find them.\nCastles were built in Europe and the Middle East, with similar buildings developing separately in Japan in the 15th century. Castles were usually built from either wood or stone, and sometimes brick. Some castles started off as wooden and were then rebuilt in stone, which was more expensive and a stronger so that the castles could be bigger. They could be built on hills or low areas like the edge of towns or at river crossings. There is the widely held idea that castles were always built on high hills; while there are some castles which make dramatic use of the landscape and are highly visible, there were a lot of factors in choosing where to build castles and only a minority were on hills. For example, many castles were built along the Rhine River so they could stop people using the river without permission.\nDepending on the exact definition, the number of castles varies and more castles are still being discovered. The numbers below are rough, and it is difficult to find estimates for some countries like Italy and Spain though they have many castles. Imitation castles have been built in the 19th and 20th century, like Neuschwanstein or some places in the United States but these are not considered genuine castles as they were not meant to be defensive.\nLife in a castle.\nThe powerful people who built castles also lived in them with their families. They would have servants and a group of people to make sure the castle worked: people fetching water, cooking, clearing the stables, looking after animals, cooking, lighting fires, and checking who was coming into the castle. In peacetime, most castles only had a few soldiers who would guard the place.\nToday, most castles have bare stone walls inside but in the Middle Ages they looked very different. Important rooms had colourful tapestries hanging on the walls, and paintings on the ceiling. Other rooms like kitchens or cupboards had plain white walls. Fireplaces kept rooms warm, and candles were used for light at night or in dark rooms. Glass was used later in the Middle Ages, but windows had shutters to keep out the cold and the weather. Religion was an important of the Middle Ages, and castles usually had chapels so that the people who lived there could pray.\nThe end of castles.\nLater in the Middle Ages, important people wanted more privacy and larger homes. It was easier to build new homes instead of trying to make the castles bigger, so some people moved out of castles into new homes. The use of gunpowder weapons also changed warfare and made castles less effective. Guns were introduced in the 14th century, and by the 15th and 16th centuries they were powerful enough to break castle walls. New types of fortification were invested, with shorter thicker walls, and using earth to absorb hits from cannonballs.\nThough cannons were powerful, castles were still used in war. In the 17th century, lots of castles were used in the English Civil War, though many of them had not been lived in for decades and needed repairs.\nCastles today.\nAs castles were built hundreds of years ago, most of them are ruins. Some are still lived in by wealthy families, or are still used by governments or armies. Because of this they might have changed and look different to old castles which were abandoned. Many castles have been turned into museums so the public can visit and learn about the past. Some castles are owned by the state, and others are owned by private people. Castles are expensive to run, so many are falling down. Every so often lightning strikes, flooding, or earthquakes damage castles.\nPeople have been interested in castle for centuries. Historians and archaeologists have searched old documents and dug into castles to find out more about them. Because of this, for some castles we know who owned them, when they were used, when bits were built, what people ate, and what kind of things happened at castles. But there are lots of places where we know very little, not even when they were built. This is because a lot of medieval documents do not survive.\nSome castle ruins have been rebuilt to look like they did originally.\nGlossary.\nSome terms you might find people using when they talk about castles:\nNotes and references.\nBooks used"}

Bulgaria is the south of the River Danube and west of the Black Sea. To the south of Bulgaria is European Turkey, Greece, and North Macedonia. To the north of the Danube is Romania, while to the west of Bulgaria is Serbia.\nThe capital and the biggest city is Sofia. Their money is called the lev. The Bulgarian government is a member of the European Union and NATO. Rumen Radev became President in 2017. The population of Bulgaria is a little more than 7 million people.\nBulgaria has its own language, called Bulgarian. It is a type of Slavic language. It is related to languages like Serbian and Russian. Bulgaria borders Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, and the Black Sea. One of the national heroes of Bulgaria is Vasil Levski who led the fight for independence in the late 1800s.\nPrehistory.\nIn what is now Bulgaria, many different people and different cultures lived over time. This includes Neolithic, Hamangia culture, Vin\u010da culture, eneolithic, Varna culture (5th millennium BC) and the Bronze Age Ezero culture.\nHistory.\nClassical Antiquity.\nThe Thracians lived in the area of modern Bulgaria (in Thrace or ). King Tere united the people in Odrysian Kingdom around 500\u00a0BC.\nAlexander the Great had influence over the people in the 4th century BC.\nThe last Hellenistic Thracian kingdom became part of the Roman Empire in the 1st century AD. The lands of Bulgaria were then part of the Roman Empire.\nEurasian Avars, South Slavs and Huns settled all over the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century.\nMedieval Bulgaria.\nThe Bulgars arrived in Thracia in the 7th century. The Bulgars established the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, after a war with the Romans in which the Bulgarians had success. In 1018, the Romans overcame the Bulgarians in war, the Bulgarian state ended, and Bulgaria became part of the Roman Empire again.\nThe Second Bulgarian Empire started in a rebellion about 1185\u00a0AD. The state had Tarnovo as the capital.\nOttoman Bulgaria.\nThe Ottoman Empire took over in 1396 and ruled Bulgaria for about 500 years. The Ottomans had very strict rules and the Bulgarians suffered. The Bulgarians rebelled several times against the Turkish rulers.\n19th century.\nIn 1876, there was the April Uprising, a Bulgarian rebellion against the Ottoman Empire. In the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878), the Russian Empire overcame the Ottomans. In 1878, Bulgaria became, in part, independent, although the Ottomans controlled its foreign policy.\n20th century.\nBulgaria pulled away from Ottoman Empire's influence with the help of the Russian Empire who were already fighting the Ottomans. But it was not until 1908 that the whole country of Bulgaria was united as modern Bulgaria.\nBulgaria joined the side of Germany in World War I and lost. Bulgaria had hoped to get part of the lands Bulgaria lost in the Balkan Wars.\nDuring the first year of World War II Bulgaria said it was neutral and refused to join sides with Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. Bulgaria's military and economy were had a close connection with Germany. Bulgaria's leaders signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany in March 1941. This let German forces go through Bulgaria to reach Greece.\nBulgaria's troops invaded Greece and Yugoslavia just after the governments of those countries surrendered. Bulgaria occupied the lands of modern North Macedonia and parts of Greece. (Both areas had been part of Bulgaria before the Balkan Wars.) The Bulgarian government also sent Jews to concentration camps and ghettoes in the Holocaust. The king of Bulgaria, Tsar Boris III, died after talking to Hitler in August 1943. Before the Tsar died, the Kingdom of Bulgaria had sent at least 11,343 Jews to the extermination camps.\nIn 1944 when it became clear that the Allied Powers would win the war, Bulgaria had to find another solution. Their leaders declared that they withdrew from the Axis forces and helped the German army leave the Balkans through Bulgaria. The Soviet Union didn't respect Bulgaria's claim to be neutral. The Red Army invaded Bulgaria in September 1944. At the same time, a new pro-Soviet government took power in Sofia. At this point, the Jews were released from the ghettoes and concentration camps in Bulgaria. The new government joined the Allies, and the military started to attack the German army, which the Bulgarian government had helped to leave Bulgarian lands.\nThe Soviets replaced the royal monarchy with Communism in 1947 before they withdrew from Bulgaria in 1949. For 40 years, under their leader Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria was very close to the Soviet Union and followed their instructions. Bulgaria invaded Czechoslovakia to stop the Prague Spring in 1968.\nShortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on 10 November 1989, the Bulgarian Communist Party gave up their rule and allowed the country to elect leaders of their own choice. But in a few years, Bulgaria had serious money problems under the new socialist government. Since that time Bulgaria has recovered in many ways and is much more stable. It is still one of the poorest countries in Europe. Problems in the administration, a weak court system, and organized crime are the biggest issues for Bulgaria.\nEconomy and Social Welfare.\nBulgaria's economy was dependent on the COMECON market. This was a group of communist countries (Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania) that agreed to work together. This group fell apart in 1989 with the fall of communism in Europe. While this was good for personal freedom, it was too much of a change for the businesses and jobs. Also, Yugoslavia, their neighbor, fell into a civil war as their country broke apart, and that did not help Bulgaria. Living standards fell by 40 percent as people lost their jobs and their savings were not worth much, and even some newborn babies were sent to orphanages when their parents could not take care of them.\nIn 1994 Bulgaria had a short economic boom. But that slowed down in 1996 from bad finance deals and other banking problems. In 1997 there was high inflation (the money could not buy as much as it did before). Retired people had little income (their pension did not go up as fast as inflation did) and their savings were not worth very much. Many retired people were begging in the streets for food. But since then the economy has grown steadily. People from outside the country started putting money into businesses and houses, and Bulgarians learned how to make their own businesses.\nToday Bulgaria has Europe's lowest income and corporate tax, 10 percent for both individuals and businesses. This makes Bulgaria a very good place for business. Bulgaria also has skilled and educated workers. The average monthly salary in Bulgaria is still cheap at 400 euro or $541 USD.\nThe state no longer has free health care. This system has been replaced by an insurance plan that people pay for, and drug costs are based on income. Private health care is encouraged nowadays. Help for people who lose their jobs is no longer automatic, but some help is available, based on family status and length of unemployment.\nThe retirement age for men is 64 years and for women 61 years. It will be 63 years and 9 months for woman and 65 years and 3 months for man in 2032.\nProvinces.\nSince 1999, Bulgaria has been divided into 28 provinces or regions. Each province is named after its local capital. The provinces are divided into municipalities, there are 264 in total.\nThere are 6 Bulgarian development regions of 27 smaller provinces. See List of settlements in Bulgaria for a list of all large locations.\nIn Bulgaria there are 5,664,624 citizens of Bulgarians, 1,200,000 citizens of Turks and 800,000 Citizens of Roma/Gypsies.\nBulgaria is classified as a developing country by the EU."}
{"id": "15938", "revid": "1068258", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15938", "title": "Alps", "text": "The Alps (, , , , , , ) is the greatest mountain range of Europe. It reaches from Austria and Slovenia in the east; through Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Germany; to France in the west. The original meaning of the word was 'white'.\nThe highest mountain in the Alps is Mont Blanc, at , on the Italian\u2013French border.\nGeography.\nThe Alps stretch from Austria and Slovenia in the east, through Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Germany to France in the west.\nThe mountains are divided into the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps. The division is along the line between Lake Constance and Lake Como, following the Rhine. The Western Alps are higher, but their central chain is shorter and curved; they are located in Italy, France and Switzerland. \nThe Eastern Alps (main ridge system elongated and broad) belong to Austria, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Slovenia and Switzerland. The highest peaks of the Western Alps are Mont Blanc, 4,808 metres (15,774\u00a0ft), Mont Blanc de Courmayeur 4,748 metres (15,577\u00a0ft), the Dufourspitze 4,634 metres (15,203\u00a0ft) and the other summits of the Monte Rosa group, and the Dom, 4,545 metres (14,911\u00a0ft). The highest peak in the Eastern Alps is Piz Bernina, 4,049 metres (13,284\u00a0ft). Perhaps the most famous location for tourist to the Alps are the Swiss Alps.\nMain chain.\nThe main chain of the Alps follows the watershed from the Mediterranean Sea to the Wienerwald, defining the northern border of Italy. It then passes over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to Col de Tende it runs to the west before turning to the northwest and then, to the north, near the Colle della Maddalena. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain goes about northeast, a heading it follows until its end near Vienna.\nCommon passes.\nThe Alps do not make an impassable block; they have been traveled by for war and commerce, and later by pilgrims, students and tourists. Mountain passes give paths between mountains, for road, train or foot traffic. Some are famous, being used for thousands of years.\nFour-thousanders.\nThe Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) has defined a list of 82 \"official\" Alpine 4,000-meter (13,123\u00a0ft) peaks. The list has many sub-peaks with little prominence, but good for mountaineering. Here are the twelve four-thousanders with at least 1\u00a0km prominence.\nKarl Blodig was the first person to climb all the main four-thousand meter peaks, round 1900.\nGeology and orogeny.\nThe reason mountains form is usually the moving together of continental plates of the Earth's crust. The Alps rose as a result of the slow but gigantic pressure of the African plate as it moved north against the stable Eurasian landmass. In particular, Italy (which had been a separate island) got pushed into Europe.\nThis all took place in the Tertiary period, mostly in the Miocene and Pliocene. That's about 35 to 5 million years ago.\nThe Alps are just a part of a larger orogenic belt of mountain chains, called the Alpide belt. It reaches through southern Europe and Asia from the Atlantic Ocean most of the way to the Himalayas. \nA gap in these mountain chains in central Europe separates the Alps from the Carpathians off to the east. Subsidence is the cause of the gaps in between.\nA great and ancient ocean was once between Africa and Europe, the Tethys Ocean. Now sediments of the Tethys Ocean basin and its Mesozoic and early Cenozoic strata sit high above sea level. Even metamorphic basement rocks are found high on Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and other high peaks in the Pennine Alps and Hohe Tauern.\nThe formation of the Mediterranean Sea is a more recent development.\nTravel and visitors.\nThe Alps are popular both in summer and in winter. The Alps as a place for sightseeing and sports. Winter sports (Alpine and Nordic skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing, snowshoeing, ski tours) can be learned in most regions from December to April. In summer, the Alps are popular with hikers, mountain bikers, paragliders, and mountaineers. There are also alpine lakes which attract swimmers, sailors and surfers. The lower places and bigger towns of the Alps are well served by motorways and main roads, but higher passes and by-roads can be bad even in the summer. Many passes are closed in winter. Many airports around the Alps (and some within), as well as long-distance rail links from all bordering countries, afford large numbers of travelers easy access from abroad. The Alps normally has more than 100 million visitors a year.\nClimate.\nThe Alps is split into five climate zones, each with a different kind of environment. The climate, plant life and animal life vary on different sections or zones of the mountain. \nThe Alps is a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher land. A rise from sea level into the upper regions causes the temperature to decrease. The effect of mountain chains on winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands and loses heat, and drops snow or rain.\nPlants.\nThe typical trees\u2014oak, beech, ash and sycamore maple have a natural height limit: the 'tree line'. Their upper limit matches the change in climate which comes with increasing height. The change from a temperate to a colder climate is also shown true by a change in the wild flowering plant life. This limit normally lies about above the sea on the north side of the Alps. On the southern slopes, it often reaches to , sometimes even to .\nThe Alps do not always have the typical trees. People have felled them in many places. Except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, forests of the typical deciduous trees are hardly found. Where such woods were, Scots pine and Norway spruce now grow. These trees are less sensitive to the attacks of goats who eat the saplings of deciduous trees.\nAbove the tree line, there is often a band of dwarf pine trees (\"Pinus mugo\"), which is taking place of dwarf shrubs. These shrubs are \"Rhododendron ferrugineum\" (on acid soils) or \"Rhododendron hirsutum\" (on non-acid soils). \nAbove this is the alpine meadow. Above the alpine meadow is where plant life becomes less and less common. At these great heights, the plants are likely to make separate groups. In the Alps, many species of flowering plants have been recorded above . These are like \"Ranunculus glacialis\", \"Androsace alpina\" and \"Saxifraga biflora\".\nAnimals.\nSpecies common to the Alps. "}

It is near Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Uganda, and Tanzania. In the Rwandan genocide of 1994, over one million (1,000,000) people were killed.\nHistory.\nColonialism.\nDuring the Scramble for Africa, Belgium conquered Rwanda. The Belgians then began to divide Rwandans into groups: Hutu, and Tutsi. The Belgians picked people that they thought looked more European to be Tutsi. The rest became Hutu. The Belgians told Rwandans that Tutsi were superior to Hutu. They helped Tutsi rule over Hutu using their army.\nAfter independence.\nOn July 1, 1962, Rwanda became independent and Hutu were given power. Thus, anti-Tutsi purges occurred frequently. Many Tutsi fled to Uganda, where they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RPF, which tried to invade Rwanda in 1990.\nThe genocide against Tutsi.\nOn the night of April 6, 1994, dictator Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana's plane was shot down, but it is still not clear who did it. Within half an hour, roadblocks manned by the Interahamwe militia were seen all over the capital, Kigali. The genocide against Tutsi had begun. It lasted for about 100 days, and it left over one million (1,000,000), Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead. The main weapon used was the machete, or \"umupanga\". Other countries paid little attention to the killing. On July 2, 1994, the RPF captured Kigali.\nProvinces.\nThere are five provinces in Rwanda. These are Northern Province, Southern Province, Eastern Province, Western Province, and the Kigali City in the centre.\nDistricts.\nThis is a list of districts in Rwanda.\nGeography.\nAt , Rwanda is the world's 149th-largest country. The entire country is at a high altitude. The lowest point is the Rusizi River at above sea level. Rwanda is in Central/Eastern Africa. It is bordered by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west, Uganda to the north, Tanzania to the east, and Burundi to the south. It is a few degrees south of the equator and is landlocked. The capital, Kigali, is near the centre of Rwanda.\nThe country's longest river is the Nyabarongo. The Nyabarongo-Kagera eventually drains into Lake Victoria. Rwanda has many lakes, the largest being Lake Kivu. It is one of the twenty deepest lakes in the world. Other sizeable lakes include Burera, Ruhondo, Muhazi, Rweru, and Ihema. Ihema is the largest of a string of lakes in the eastern plains of Akagera National Park.\nThere are many mountains in central and western Rwanda. The highest peaks are found in the Virunga volcano chain in the northwest. This includes Mount Karisimbi, Rwanda's highest point, at . The centre of the country is mostly rolling hills. The eastern border area has savanna, plains and swamps.\nRwanda has a temperate tropical highland climate. It has lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries. This is because of its high elevation. Kigali, in the centre of the country, has a typical daily temperature range between and . There is little change through the year. There are two rainy seasons in the year. The first runs from February to June and the second from September to December. These are separated by two dry seasons. The major one is from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all. There is a shorter and less severe one from December to February.\nBiodiversity.\nIn prehistoric times montane forest covered one third of the land of present-day Rwanda. Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly in the three National parks, with terraced agriculture in the rest of the country. Nyungwe, the largest remaining forest, has 200 species of tree as well as orchids and begonias. Vegetation in the Volcanoes National Park is mostly bamboo and moorland, with small areas of forest. Akagera has a savanna ecosystem. Here there are mostly acacia. There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including \"Markhamia lutea\" and \"Eulophia guineensis\".\nThe greatest diversity of large mammals is found in the three National Parks. Akagera has typical savanna animals such as giraffes and elephants, while Volcanoes is home to about one third of the worldwide mountain gorilla population. Nyungwe Forest has thirteen primate species including chimpanzees and \"Colobus\" monkeys. The Ruwenzori colobus move in groups of up to 400, the largest troop size of any primate in Africa.\nThere are 670 bird species in Rwanda. There is a difference between the east and the west. Nyungwe Forest, in the west, has 280 recorded species. Species include the Ruwenzori Turaco and Handsome Francolin. Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, has savanna birds such as the Black-headed Gonolek and those who live near swamps and lakes, including storks and cranes."}

He was chosen to run as vice president next to William Henry Harrison. Whig Party people used to say \"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\" to get people to vote for them. (William Henry Harrison was famous for being a general in a battle in a place called Tippecanoe, and that was his nickname.)\nHarrison and Tyler won the election, but Harrison died one month later. Tyler then became president.\nPresidency.\nBecause Tyler had not been elected to hold the office of President, some people thought that he lacked a claim to the position. But as the United States Constitution says that the Vice President is vested with the responsibilities of the Presidency in case of \"Death, Resignation or Inability\" of the former, Tyler said this meant the position was his to fill. A majority of the government agreed and he was sworn in as the new President, however, the Whig Party did not want Tyler, and a lot of Whigs ended up calling him \"the accidental president\" or \"His Accidency\".\nThis was after Tyler had angered the Whigs when he decided to mainly pick people from the Democratic Party to work in his government. He wanted to bring the two parties to together, but instead this ended up making him unpopular. He also rejected many of the Whigs' ideas. This all lead to the Whig Party deciding not to back his run for the presidency in 1844.\nWhile he was president, Florida became a new state. After winning their independence in the Texas Revolution against Mexico, Texas had become its own country. Tyler sought to annex Texas and turn it into a new U.S. state while in office, but this did not come to fruition until a few months after his term had ended.\nAfter presidency.\nThe Whig Party did not want Tyler to be president again, and did not pick him to run for president in 1844. He had some friends in the Democratic Party who sometimes asked him for ideas, but that party did not like him enough to be president, either. Tyler was sometimes called \"the President without a party\" since both groups did not want him.\nWhen the Confederate States of America was created, Tyler thought that states should be allowed to make their own laws, even about slavery. He did not want a civil war. Instead, he tried to get the United States to agree to let the southern states keep slavery. But the United States Congress said no, and Tyler decided that Virginia had to join the Confederacy. He later was elected to the Confederate congress, but died before taking the job.\nTyler died in Richmond, Virginia on January 18, 1862 of a stroke. Tyler's death was the only one in Presidential history not to be officially recognized in Washington, D. C. because of his loyalty to the Confederacy. His coffin was covered with the Confederate flag. He is the only United States President ever to be buried and honored ceremoniously under a foreign flag that is not the United States flag."}

Her parents are Muggles (not magical) but she is the brightest witch of her class. She was born on September 19, 1979 and when she arrived at Hogwarts for the very first time, she was almost 12, since she was borned after September 1st, she has to wait a year later. Her parents are dentists. She is intelligent and her special skill is the ability to remember all that she has read. Because of this, Hermione is successful in her tests. Although she is smart, she also is brave and has street-smarts. She cares about house-elves and has made the club S.P.E.W., the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, which Ron mockingly calls \"Spew.\" She made scarfs and garments to liberate the elves of the slavery of the wizards. But none of the elves took the garments and Dobby (the old house elf of the Malfoy family) gathered them. She is one of the prefects of Gryffindor with Ron. Her appearance is made up of bushy brown hair, dark brown eyes, and huge front teeth, which Draco Malfoy enlarged it in her fourth year. It is also noted at the end of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" that she marries Ron and they have two children together called Rose and Hugo, to which the children has taken after their parents' initials. Although in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" she was the dance partner of Viktor Krum. She belongs to Gryffindor house, which is known for bravery. The Sorting Hat thought about putting her in Ravenclaw house, which is known for wisdom, but finally it put her in Gryffindor. Hermione has a pet cat named Crookshanks, which Ron told her it was like a hairy pig. \nIn the first book Hermione had the personality of a snob, and a geek, and she is not very friendly but with the time she improves that. Hermione was teased as Mudblood (Witch/ Wizard born with no Magical parents, also known as an offensive insult on Muggle Born Witch/ Wizard) by many Slytherins, especially Draco Malfoy. Her name refers to The Winter's Tale, by William Shakespeare, and was the daughter of Helen of Troy from Ancient Greek Mythology."}

It was started by Colonel Sanders in Corbin, Kentucky in 1952. They are now all over the world. They not only sell chicken, but also other food like salads and french fries. KFC, also known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, is an American fast food restaurant chain that specializes in fried chicken. Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, it is the world's second-largest restaurant chain after McDonald's, with almost 20,000 locations globally in 123 countries and territories as of December 2015.\nAdvertising.\nKFC is well known for their \"finger lickin' good\" slogan. It was first used, along with others, beginning in 1956. It is the current slogan.\nUpon the corona virus pandemic in 2020, the slogan was temporarily changed to \"fork licking good\" to discourage the spread of the virus from eating with potentially contaminated hands.\nOther early slogans included \"North America's Hospitality Dish\" (1956\u20131966) and \"We fix Sunday dinner seven nights a week\" from 1957 until 1968. The two slogans were phased out in favor of the \"finger lickin' good\" slogan. It was trademarked in 1956.\nAfter a local KFC TV ad showed an employee licking his fingers in the background, a viewer phoned the station to complain. The main actor in the ad answered back: \"Well, it's finger lickin' good.\" The phrase was adopted nationally by the company in the 1960s. It became one of the best-known slogans of the twentieth century. \nWhen the trademark expired in the United States in 2006, it was replaced with \"Follow your taste\" until 2010. In 2011, the \"finger lickin' good\" slogan was dropped in favor of \"So good\", to be used around the world. The meaning was supposed to include employees and service, as well as food.\nThe slogan \"Nobody does chicken like KFC\" was first started by KFC Australia in 1998. It is still used by KFC in some worldwide markets.\nCriticism.\nKFC has been criticised on different issues. Greenpeace accused KFC of destroying the Amazon Rainforest. This is because KFC bought their soy they use for chicken food from Cargill. The soy has been traced back to the European KFC. Cargill has reportedly been exporting soy illegally for several years. The Greenpeace organization researched the issue and brought it to the attention of the parent company YUM! Brands, Inc. The parent company denied the illegal operation, and said that their supply of soy is grown in parts of Brazil. Greenpeace has called on KFC to stop purchasing soy from Cargill, to avoid contributing to the destruction of the Amazon.\nSince 2003, animal rights and welfare organizations, led by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), have been protesting KFC\u2019s treatment of the animals used for its products. These groups claim that the recommendations of the KFC Animal Welfare Advisory Council have been ignored. Adele Douglass, a former member of the council, said in an SEC filing reported on by the Chicago Times, that KFC \"never had any meetings. They never asked any advice, and then they touted to the press that they had this animal-welfare advisory committee. I felt like I was being used.\"\nKFC responded by saying the chickens used in its products are bought from suppliers like Perdue Farms, Tyson Foods, and Pilgrim's Pride, and that these suppliers are routinely monitored for animal welfare violations. Several PETA undercover investigations and videos of these and other KFC suppliers purport to show chickens being beaten, ripped apart, and thrown against walls contradict KFC\u2019s claims. PETA has criticised some of the practices of chicken breeders, such as beak trimming and overcrowding, but KFC says its suppliers meets UK legal requirements. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recommends a maximum stocking density of 34\u00a0kg\u2014around 30 chickens\u2014per square metre, and say that in circumstances where beak trimming needs to be carried out to prevent the birds injuring each other, only one third of the beak should be trimmed \"measured from the tip towards the entrance of the nostrils\". PETA states that they have held more than 12,000 demonstrations at KFC outlets since 2003 because of this alleged mistreatment of chickens by KFC suppliers.\nIn June 2008, KFC Canada agreed to PETA's demands for better welfare standards, including favoring suppliers who use controlled-atmosphere killing (CAK) of chickens, and other welfare standards as well as introducing a vegan sandwich at 65% of its outlets. PETA has called off its campaign against KFC Canada, but continues to demonstrate against KFC elsewhere in the world."}

It started mainly due to a fight for areas thought to be Holy Land. Both Muslims and Christians considered the same lands holy for reasons like Jesus' resurrections and Muhammad visiting there. The eight big crusade expeditions occurred during 1096 to 1291. The Holy Land is very important for the three major monotheistic religions: Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. There are many important religious sites in the Holy Land. This is the land now called Israel. Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem and other religious sites fell under the control of Muslims during the Caliphate of Omar.\nThere were many different crusades. The most important and biggest Crusades took place from the 11th century to the 13th century. There were 9 large crusades during this time. They are numbered 1 through 9. There were also many smaller Crusades. Some crusades were even within Europe (for example, in Germany, Austria and Scandinavia). The smaller Crusades continued to the 16th century, until the Renaissance and Reformation.\nThe word \"Crusade\" is related to the word \"Cross\", and means a Christian holy war. There is also the Arabic word \"Jihad\", which means to strive and struggle by Muslims. All sides (Christians, Muslims, and Jews) believed very much in their religions. They also had political reasons for war.\nFirst Crusades.\nAlexius I was a ruler of the Byzantine Empire. When Alexius called for help to defend his empire against the Seljuk Turks in 1095, Pope Urban II asked all Christians to join a war against the Turks. The Pope told Christians that fighting the war would repay God for their sins and that if they died on a crusade they would go straight to heaven. The Christian soldiers were called \"crusaders\". The Christian armies marched to Jerusalem, attacking several cities on their way. In 1099 they won the battle for Jerusalem. As a result of the First Crusade, four crusader states were created. These were the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli and the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nSecond Crusade.\nAfter some years of peace,\u00a0Bernard of Clairvaux\u00a0called for a new crusade when the town of\u00a0Edessa\u00a0was attacked by the Turks. French and German armies marched to the Holy Land in 1147, but were defeated. On the way, the Crusaders helped the Portuguese capture Lisbon from Al-Andalus as part of the Reconquista.\nThird Crusade.\nIn 1187, Saladin recaptured Jerusalem. Pope Gregory VIII called for a new crusade, led by several of Europe's kings: Philip II of France, Richard I of England and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick drowned in Cilicia in 1190. The Crusaders re-established the Kingdom of Jerusalem in Acre. Richard defeated Saladin at Arsuf and Jaffa but lacked the men needed to attempt recapturing Jerusalem. Richard and Saladin made a truce that let the Christians travel safely through Jerusalem. Afterward Richard left in 1192. On Richard's way home, his ship was wrecked, leading him to Austria. In Austria his enemy Duke Leopold captured him, and Richard was ransomed.\nFourth Crusade.\nThe Fourth Crusade was started by Pope Innocent III in 1202, with the idea to attack the Holy Land through Egypt. The Venetians changed this crusade, and went to the Christian city of Constantinople, where they attempted to place a Byzantine exile on the throne. After a series of misunderstandings and outbreaks of violence, the city was sacked in 1204.\nAlbigensian Crusade.\nThe Albigensian Crusade was started in 1209 to eliminate the Cathars of southern Europe\nChildren's Crusade.\nThe Children's Crusade is a crusade of 1212. An outburst of the old popular enthusiasm led a gathering of children in France and Germany. A boy, from either France or Germany, said that Jesus had visited him, and told him to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Following this vision, many children formed bands, and marched to Italy. There, they were put onto ships which either capsized in a storm, or which went to Morocco. Most of the children either starved to death or were sold into slavery.\nMore recent research.\nIn the first movement, Nicholas, a shepherd from Germany, led a group across the Alps and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. About 7,000 arrived in Genoa in late August. However, their plans did not bear fruit when the waters failed to part as promised and the band broke up. Some left for home, others may have gone to Rome, while still others may have travelled down the Rh\u00f4ne to Marseille where they were probably sold into slavery. Few returned home and none reached the Holy Land.\nThe second movement was led by a \"shepherd boy\" named Stephen de Cloyes near the village of Ch\u00e2teaudun. In June of that year, the boy said that he had a letter for the king of France from Jesus. He could gather a crowd of over 30,000 and went to Saint-Denis. There he was seen to work miracles. On the orders of Philip II, on the advice of the University of Paris, the crowd was sent home, and most of them went. None of the contemporary sources mentions plans of the crowd to go to Jerusalem.\nLater chroniclers elaborated on these events. Recent research suggests those taking part were not children, at least not the very young. In the early 1200s, bands of wandering poor started cropping up throughout Europe. These were people displaced by economic changes at the time which forced many poor peasants in northern France and Germany to sell their land. These bands were referred to as \"pueri\" (Latin for \"boys\") in a condescending manner, in much the same way that people from rural areas in the United States are called \"country boys.\"\nIn 1212, a young French \"puer\" named Stephen and a German \"puer\" named Nicholas separately began claiming that they had each had similar visions of Jesus. This resulted in these bands of roving poor being united into a religious protest movement which transformed this forced wandering into a religious journey. The \"pueri\" marched, following the Cross. They associated themselves with Jesus's biblical journey. This, however, was not a prelude to a holy war.\nAt that time, chronicles were mostly kept by the Catholic Church. They were written in Latin.\nThirty years later, chroniclers read the accounts of these processions and translated \"pueri\" as \"children\" without understanding the usage. So, the Children's Crusade was born. The resulting story illustrates how ingrained the concept of Crusading was in the people of that time\u2014 the chroniclers assumed that the pueri must have been Crusaders. In their innocence, they returned to the foundations of crusading characteristic of Peter the Hermit, and met the same sort of tragic fate.\nAccording to Matthew Paris, one of the leaders of the Children's Crusade became \"Le Ma\u00eetre de Hongrie,\" the leader of the Shepherds' Crusade in 1251.\nFifth Crusade.\nDuring 1213, Pope Gregory IX pushed Frederick II into leading the Fifth Crusade.\nThe Church tried another crusade to retake the Holy Land. A crusading force from Hungary, Austria, and Bavaria captured Damietta, a city in Egypt, in 1219. The crusaders had to surrender, due to losing the battle for Cairo.\nSixth Crusade.\nIn 1228, Emperor Frederick II set sail from Brindisi for Syria. He did this after the Pope excommunicated him. By talking to the Turks he had success, and Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Bethlehem was given to the Crusaders for ten years without fighting. This was the first major crusade not initiated by the Papacy, a trend that was to continue for the rest of the century. This crusade only lasted for a year, from 1228 to 1229.\nSeventh Crusade.\nThe Templars argued with Egypt in 1243. In 1244, Egypt attacked Jerusalem. Louis IX of France started a crusade against Egypt from 1248 to 1254. It was a failure and Louis spent much of the crusade living in the city of Acre. In the midst of this crusade was the first in 1251.\nEighth Crusade.\nThe Eighth Crusade was organized by Louis IX of France in 1270, to help the Crusader states in Syria. However, the crusade got as far as Tunis, where Louis died a month later.\nNinth Crusade.\nBefore he was the king, Edward I of England started a crusade in 1271. He retired the following year after a truce.\nThe end of the Crusades.\nIn time, the people went on Crusades for other purposes. The Crusades ended two centuries after they had begun, achieving mixed results. The crusades ended with the Mamluk Fall of Acre in 1291. (the link is not yet started)."}

At the height of his power, his sultanate included Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen and other parts of North Africa.\nHis father, who worked for the Turkish governor, decided to raise him in Syria where he received his education. Another influential figure in his life was his uncle Shirkuh who was a military leader and later commanded for Saladin during the wars. Many Muslims consider him a hero for defeating the Crusaders over 20 years of battles. The Crusades were series of battles between Christian Europe and Islamic Near East over holy land in what is now known as Palestine. Saladin\u2019s army protected Egypt from the Crusaders in 1168. \nThe ruler of the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt made him Vizier, meaning prime minister, even though he was not Shi'ite. Just before the Caliph died, Saladin was crowned Sultan of Egypt and Syria. His greatest victory was at the Horns of Hattin in July 1187 AD, after which Jerusalem fell to the Muslims (October 1187) and was never again recovered by the Crusaders. He is also remembered for his series of battles and wins and losses against King Richard I of England. These were inconclusive and in the end resulted in a moral victory for Sultan Salah ad-Din, when Richard's Crusade failed and returned to Europe.\nHe founded the Ayyubid dynasty of Egypt, Syria, Yemen (except for the Northern Mountains), Iraq, Mecca Hejaz and Diyar Bakr. Salah ad-Din is a title which translates to \"The Righteousness of the Faith\" from Arabic.\nMany books were written about Saladin, the things he did and the battles he won. \"Daastaan Imaan Farooshoon Ki\" is one book in Urdu written by Althamash that says very good things about Saladin and compares and contrasts him to other kings and princes, in a favourable light."}

Niagara falls is very well known for both its beauty and hydroelectric power. It has been a tourist attraction, commercial site and hydroelectricity source since the 19th century.\nIt is located near Niagara Falls, New York in the United States and Niagara Falls, Ontario in Canada.The volume of water approaching the falls during peak flow season may sometimes be as much as 225,000 cubic feet (6,400 m3) per second. The cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York, United States, are connected by two international bridges.\nNiagara Falls were formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age). Water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario and the Atlantic Ocean. The Escarpment has hard limestone on top and soft shale below.\nAlthough not very high, Niagara Falls is very wide, and is probably the most popular waterfall in the world. The Horseshoe Falls are the largest out of the three falls. It is named the Horseshoe Falls because it looks like a horse shoe. \nNiagara Falls is a very popular tourist destination and many people visit it on holiday in Canada."}

It sometimes has sour cream to make it easier to shape and may have fruit flavoring such as strawberry, blueberry, or lemon. It is often topped with fresh fruit or chocolate.\nHistory.\nCheesecake is now often thought to be part of American cooking, but it has a long history. Cheese making began around 2000, and scientists who study people in the past have found cheese molds almost as old.\nCheesecakes are known to go back to at least Greece. In the 100s, the writer Athenaeus's \"Dinner-Table Philosophers\" mentioned the poet Callimachus (around the 200s) used to have a book by an \"Aegimius\" about the art of making cheesecakes (, \"Plakountopouk\u00f3n S\u00fdngramma\"). Cheesecake may have been given to the sportspeople during the Olympic Games, which started in 776.\nEven before the Romans took over Greece, they had begun making cheesecakes as well. M. Porcius Cato's \"Book on Farming\" (written around 160) mentions three kinds of cakes', ', and \"\"for use as offerings to the gods. Placenta cakes were the closest to today's cheesecakes, since its crust and filling are made separately. \nEuropeans stopped using yeast and started adding beaten eggs to their cheesecakes around the 1700s. This made it taste more like a dessert than a cheesebread. \nCheesecake recipes were brought to the United States as people moved there from Europe. Most of today's kinds of cheesecake (\"New York-style cheesecake\") come from the kind created by William Lawrence of Chester, New York, in 1872. He was trying to make something like the soft French Neufch\u00e2tel cheese and ended up with a heavy, creamy \"unripened cheese\".\nTypes.\nThere is an all-garlic restaurant in Stockholm where they offer a garlic cheesecake.\nOther.\nSonya Thomas holds the world record for eating the most cheesecakes in a given time.

The big distinction is between Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Some examples of monkeys are macaques, baboons, guenons and marmosets.\nBoth these groups are in the infraorder Simiiformes. That infraorder also includes the great apes and man.\nSome monkeys live almost entirely in trees. Others live partly on the ground. Monkeys are mainly vegetarian, with a strong preference for fruit. However, they may eat a wide range of other food, including insects. Monkeys can live in forests and savannahs, but not in deserts. Some can live in snowy mountains, but more live in rainforests.

New World Monkeys are often smaller than Old World Monkeys. Monkeys have long arms and legs to help them swing from trees. Some monkeys' tails can wrap tightly around branches, almost like a \"fifth limb\". This type of tail is 'prehensile'.\nThe smallest known monkey is the pygmy marmoset.

The Romans usually wanted conquered people to live in towns. When people are civilized, they have learned from the wisdom, skill and knowledge gained over centuries of human progress. The opposite of civilization is sometimes said to be entropy, barbarity, rudeness, or animal-like behavior. \nA civilization is generally an advanced stage of organization. That means it has laws, culture, a regular way of getting food and protecting the people. Most civilizations have agriculture, and a system of government like monarchs or elections. They speak a common language, and usually have a religion of some kind. They teach their young the knowledge they need. All civilizations since the Sumerians and the Egyptians have had some kind of writing. This is because writing lets people store and build up knowledge.\nPast societies that would be called more primitive compared to today, are still often referred to as civilizations for their time. The Roman Empire is an example of a past large civilization. It was governed from Rome. This empire once stretched from the Scottish borders to North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. Their language was Latin. \nLatin remained the preferred way of communication among educated people, long after their civilization had vanished. Some scientists, scholars and others still use Latin in the course of everyday work, even though the Roman civilization fell apart more than 1,500 years ago. The Roman civilization lasted almost 1000 years.\nOne way a civilization ends is to become part of another civilization. For example, Ancient Egypt was conquered by foreigners who changed the country. It became part of Persian, Greek, Roman, and Islamic civilization. Another way is to go back to an earlier, simpler way of life. For example, Roman civilization collapsed in the Dark Ages. When people became more civilized again, it was the Medieval civilization. "}

Once you get to Nirvana you are not born again into samsara (which is suffering). Buddhists believe a person can become enlightened by following the Middle Way; the Middle Way is not too extreme in either way of living, neither an extremely luxurious life of ease and enjoyment nor an extremely harsh life on living on the minimum of the most basic necessities. One develops Sila (morality), Samadhi (concentration), and Prajna (insight or wisdom). This is thought to take a very long time, according to many buddhist monks and nuns.\nMethod.\nAfter establishing a strong foundation of Sila (morality), Buddhists become enlightened by using meditation. While they practice Vipassana meditation, they relax their mind with clear understanding of the law of impermanence, which clears their minds of all attachments; craving, aversion, and delusion are destroyed.\nThe Buddha.\nSiddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) is described as the first known (historical) person to have reached enlightenment and was the founder of Buddhism. (Buddhists know him as the Shakyamuni Buddha, and believe there were Buddhas before him and will be after him.) The story of his life is told as an example of what he learned.\nLife at the Palace.\nSiddhartha was a rich aristocrat and the son of a ruler of a republic. His father went to a fortune teller who predicted that Siddhartha would either become a king or a religious leader. If Siddhartha saw any suffering then he would become a great religious leader. His father wanted him to become a king, so he gave Siddhartha many things and did not let him see any suffering. Siddhartha married a woman and had a son. He named his son Rahula. Some say Siddhartha left the palace to pursue a spiritual path on the day his son was born.\nFour Sights.\nSiddhartha went to the Shramana teachers to ask for help. Siddhartha traveled for four days. On the first day, he saw an old man. On the second day, he saw a sick woman. On the third day, he saw a funeral. It was his first time seeing death. On the fourth day he saw a sadhu (holy man). This man was very poor. Siddhartha thought that the man was happy even though he was poor. Siddhartha also knew that he was not happy even though he was rich. He decided to leave the palace and never go back.\nAsceticism.\nSiddhartha walked through the forest. In the forest, he found a group of ascetics. He watched them and thought this was the way to be enlightened. For six years he lived with the ascetics. For some time, he ate one grain of rice and drank from the river every day. One day a boat was on the river with a musician and his students on it. Siddhartha heard the musician say, \"If the string is too tight, it will snap. If it is too loose, it will not play.\" After hearing that, Siddhartha knew that he wanted to find a middle way, something more effective than asceticism. He took a bowl of rice with milk from a village woman. He then had the strength, to meditate until Enlightenment.\nEnlightenment.\nSiddhartha sat at the bottom of the Bodhi tree. He made a promise to keep meditating until he was enlightened. For forty days Devaputra Mara, the leader of demons, tried to stop Siddhartha. He made Siddhartha think of scary things. He made demons try to hurt Siddhartha with spears, arrows, fire, and rocks. Siddhartha did not fear them and kept his mind relaxed and the hurtful things became like flowers and many coloured lights. From Sila (morality), Samadhi (concentration), and Prajna (insight; wisdom), he became enlightened. After he was enlightened, he taught people about what he had learned for 45 years. He died when he was 80 years old."}

Since the early 19th century, most national postal systems have been controlled entirely by governments. The governments make people pay a fee to send something. This fee is usually in the form of stamps. Some governments only let private postal services deliver parcel (non-mail) packages.\nPostal systems often do things other than sending letters. In some countries, the postal system is also in charge of telephone and telegraph systems.

Ancient Greek and Latin are very important languages. Although they are no longer spoken, they influenced almost all modern European languages.\nGreek had many different dialects. Attic Greek was spoken in Athens, the largest city, and was thought to be the purest form of Greek. Later, in the educated Roman world, children were taught Greek as a second language just as many people now learn English as their second language. Koine Greek was the common language of Greeks. It was Attic Greek mixed with several other dialects.\nHomer spoke and wrote in an old dialect that was somewhat different from Attic Greek. The \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" are long poems that tell exciting stories about warfare, travel and the Greek gods. In the 5th century BC, some great plays were written by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. The Golden Age of Ancient Greece inspired literature that has been read for centuries.\nAttic Greek.\nAttic Greek was the dialect that was spoken in Athens and the rest of the region of Attica. It was the dialect most similar to later forms of Greek since it was the standard form of the language. It is studied in Ancient Greek courses because it was the most common dialect.\nChanges.\nAll languages change with time, and Greek has changed a great deal over 2500 years. Modern Greek is often said to have started in the year 1453 AD.\nUnlike Latin, Ancient Greek did not split into many languages, but it is still considered to be a separate language from Modern Greek. The pronunciation has changed; for instance, beta was pronounced \"b\" in Ancient Greek, but it is pronounced \"v\" and is called \"vita\" in Modern Greek. The spelling has not changed much, which gives the appearance of less change than has actually happened. Also, many different vowels and diphthongs merged into \"i\", the vowel sound in the English word \"ski\". The tonal system of Ancient Greek has disappeared, but modern Greek had only recently changed its spelling to match that change.\nDespite these changes, much of the language has remarkably survived intact through the centuries. There is a community near Trabzon, Turkey, that speaks a dialect that is closer to Ancient Greek than to Standard Modern Greek."}

He was known for his twelve-tone system of writing music.\nHistory.\nSchoenberg came from a strict Jewish family who had moved to Austria from Hungary. They were quite poor and Schoenberg taught himself about music. When he was grown up he had to do a lot of teaching to try and earn enough money to live. In later life he went to live in the United States. It took a long time before he was recognized world-wide as a great composer. His two most famous pupils were Alban Berg (1885-1935) and Anton Webern (1883-1945). He taught them how to write twelve-tone music and they became famous composers.\nWhen Arnold Schoenberg was a young man he was living in the late 19th century. If you look at the way composers wrote music at this time you will find that their compositions became more and more chromatic. This means that more and more sharps and flats were used during the piece, and the music went from one key to another (modulated) very quickly. Richard Wagner wrote very chromatic music, especially in his opera \"Tristan and Isolde\".\nReligion.\nIn 1898 Schoenberg converted to Christianity in the Lutheran church. According to MacDonald, this was partly to connect with Western European cultural traditions, and partly as a means of self-defence \"in a time of resurgent anti-Semitism\".\nIn 1933, after long thought, he returned to Judaism, because he realised that \"his racial and religious heritage was inescapable\", and to take up an unmistakable position on the side opposing Nazism. He would self-identify as a member of the Jewish religion later in life.\nEarly work.\nSchoenberg\u2019s early works are mostly Late Romantic. His piece \"Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht\" (which can be played by six string instruments or by a whole orchestra) has very beautiful harmonies which go quickly from one key to another. Gradually Schoenberg\u2019s music changed. It became so chromatic that it was no longer in any key at all. Music like this (called \u201catonal\u201d) is much harder to understand. His \"Five Orchestral Pieces\" were played by the conductor Sir Henry Wood at a Promenade Concert in 1912. The audience did not like it at first and took some time to get used to the sound.\nTwelve-tone system.\nIn 1923 Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone system for which he is famous. This is music which is based on a particular row of notes. Twelve-tone music is atonal because there is no feeling of being in any key, because of the equal use of every pitch."}

One is by a way of a knockout, which is when a fighter is punched and falls to the ground and cannot get back up within ten seconds. Another way is by a technical knockout, which is when the fighter can not continue fighting thus the referee stops the fight. Technical knockout wins and losses are also knockout wins or losses for a boxer. Another possibility is winning on points, which a boxer gets by outboxing his or her opponent by hitting the opponent more often, harder, and more accurately. There are also draws in boxing. What in other sports are called \"tie\" in boxing it's called \"draw\". A referee can announce a technical draw due to an accidental cut or an accidental wound like a headbutt. Generally, it is considered a \"no contest\" (NC)-in which case, the fight is considered as not having taken place at all and not counting as a fight. However, after the fourth round, if the score cards for both fighters are equal, the fight could be called a draw. It is a way to defeat your enemy by brute physical force. Each round lasts 3 minutes for men, 2 minutes for women."}

He created over 20,000 images.\nHe is considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is best known as the co-founder of cubism. A work of art is cubist when the artist opts to break up objects and reassemble them in abstract and geometric form. Picasso could draw and paint when he was very young. His first word was \"l\u00e1piz\", the Spanish word for \"pencil\".\nPerhaps his most famous painting is \"Guernica\", which shows the horrors of war after the bombing of the town of Guernica. He spent most of his life in France when he was an adult.\nHe was 90 years old when a number of his works were shown in an exhibition at the Louvre in Paris. He was the first living artist to have an exhibition at the Louvre.\nPicasso had four children with three women. He died of heart failure in Mougins, France, on April 8 1973.\nChildhood.\nPablo Picasso was born on October 25 1881 in M\u00e1laga, Spain. His father was a painter and teacher Jos\u00e9 Ruiz Blasco and his mother was Mar\u00eda Picasso L\u00f3pez. Until 1898, he signed his pictures with the names of his father and of his mother. After around 1901, he only used his mother's name. At the age of eight, Picasso created his first oil painting called \"The Picador\". In 1891, Pablo moved with his family to Northern Spain, where his father taught at the \"Instituto da Guarda\". One year later, Pablo studied at this institute. Pablo's father was his teacher at this time. In 1896, he started to attend the art school in Barcelona after passing the entrance examination.&lt;ref name=\"picasso-de/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One year later in 1897, Picasso started to study at the \"Academia San Fernando\" in Madrid. In 1898, he left the academy and went to a rest to Horta de Ebro. In 1900, he published his first illustrations in a newspaper in Barcelona. This exhibition had over 60 portraits.\nBeginning of the Career.\nPicasso made his first trip to Paris in 1900, where he lived with Max Jacob, a poet and journalist. When Max was working during the day, Pablo slept and when Max slept at night, Pablo worked. Picasso had to burn his paintings to keep himself warm. \"Lovers in the Street\" and \"Moulin de la Galette\" are examples of his Paris work from this time. Both pictures were painted in 1900.\nHe went back to Madrid in 1901 where he worked for a newspaper called \"Arte Joven\". He was responsible for illustrations. At this time, he shortened his signature from \"Pablo Ruiz y Picasso\" to \"Picasso\". This is the time his so-called \"Blue Period\" started. The two 1903 paintings, \"The Soup\" and \"Crouching Woman,\" are examples. His \"Blue Period\" ended in 1904 when he settled in Paris.\nIn 1905, Picasso made a trip to Holland. In the same year, Pablo's \"Rosa Period\" started. During this period, Picasso mostly painted circus motives. \"Girl Balancing on a Ball\" and \"The Actor\" are two early paintings from this time. This period lasted until 1907.\nPicasso's Cubism period started in 1909 and ended around 1912. This period was inspired by the French painter Paul C\u00e9zanne. This period is called \"Cubism\" because of the use of cubes and other shapes. During this time, Picasso painted musical instruments, still life objects, and also his friends.\nPicasso had his first exhibition in the United States in 1911. One year later in 1912, he had his first exhibition in Great Britain. Pablo's father died in May 1913.\nDuring the First World War.\nFrom 1912 to 1919 was Picasso's so called \"Synthetic Cubism Period\". During this time, he started to use collages in his paintings. His works from this time are called \"papiers coll\u00e9s\". He has spent his time during the First World War in Rome. In 1914, Picasso spent the whole summer in Avignon. In 1915, he started to paint realistic again. At the end of the same year, his wife Eva died. During the World War, he also worked as a designer for Sergey Diaghilev.\nIn 1917, Picasso met Olga Koklova, a Russian dancer. In the same year, he painted several realistic portraits of her and their friends. One year later, he married her. The last summer of the wartime, Picasso and his wife spent in Barcelona and Biarritz.\nAfter the First World War.\nIn 1921, Picasso's son Paul was born. Due to this occasion, he painted several paintings with his wife and his son on it. Paul was Picasso's only legitimate son. In 1925, he took part in the first Surrealist exhibition in Paris. Between 1924 and 1926, Picasso preferred to paint abstract still lives. In 1927, hes got known to Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. She became his model and mistress. In 1928, he started a new period where he began to make sculptural works. In 1931, he left his wife and moved with his mistress to Boisgeloup. There they lived in a country home. There, Picasso had a room for his sculptures only. Since 1932, he used Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se as a model. During a travel in Spain, he started to use the bullfight as a new topic of his paintings. In 1935, Picasso's daughter, Ma\u00efa, was born. At this time, he got divorced from his wife because of the birth of Ma\u00efa. In 1936, Picasso got a job as director of the Prado-Museum in Madrid. During this time, the Spanish Civil War started. German bombs fell on Guernica in Spain on 26 April 1937. Picasso used this impact to paint one of his most famous paintings, Guernica. This painting was completed in about 2 months. It was first shown in the Spanish Pavilion in Paris in 1937.\nDuring the Second World War.\nIn 1938, Picasso's mother died. When the Second World War started on 1 September 1939, Picasso returned to Paris. Around 1943, he got known to the painter Fran\u00e7oise Gilot. She bore to him one son and one daughter. In 1941, he wrote his first play \"Le d\u00e9sir attrap\u00e9 par la queue\" (English: \"Desire Caught by the Tail\"). It was first shown in 1944. Also in 1944, Picasso joined the communist Party. Picasso spent almost the full war time in Paris.\nPicasso's Death.\nOn 8th of April 1973, Pablo Picasso died due to heart failure at the age of 91 years in Mougins, France. "}

A good first aid kit will often include a simple First Aid Guide.\nIt is best to have good training to give first aid. In addition to books and videos, good training includes a good teacher and the chance to practice. For example, CPR is practiced on a dummy called a mannequin, so a student can learn to push down on someone's chest in an emergency without actually doing it to a person. The teacher makes sure the first aid student is doing the skill correctly.\nTraining can be given by an organization or by a professional medical person, like a doctor, a nurse, or a paramedic. Organizations that teach first aid include the International Red Cross, schools, hospitals, the military, Scout groups, and rescue groups such as fire departments.\nThe level of training needed to be a first aid helper changes from country to country. For example, in the United Kingdom and the United States, you can go on a 1-day course to become a first aid giver. In the U.K., you can go on a 4-day course for emergencies in a place of work. All firefighters, police officers, and soldiers are trained in first aid during their basic training.\nFirst aid kits.\nFirst aid kits may be kept in cloth bags or plastic or metal boxes. They are often labeled with a symbol such as those on the upper right. A first aid kit may contain many items, but basic items that can help with first aid include:"}

He became an anarchist in the 1860s, and was one of the first people in the movement. Before that he was part of the left-wing of pan-Slavism. He is also known as the father of Russian nihilism.\nHistory.\nMikhail was born in the Russian Empire to a family of Russian nobles. As a young man he was a junior officer in the Russian army, but he quit his commission in 1835. He went to school in Moscow to study philosophy and began to attend radical groups where he was greatly influenced by Alexander Herzen. Bakunin left Russia in 1842 for Dresden, and eventually Paris where he met George Sand, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Karl Marx\nHe was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia's oppression of Poland. In 1849 he was arrested in Dresden for being involved in the Czech rebellion of 1848. He was turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in Peter-Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg. He remained there until 1857, when he was sent to a work camp in Siberia. He escaped to Japan, the U.S. and finally ended up in London for a short time, then Switzerland and Italy.\nIn 1868, Bakunin joined the socialist International Working Men's Association, a group of trade unions and workers' organizations. A disagreement with Marx, an important person in this organization, ended with Bakunin kicked out for having a \"secret organisation within the International\".\nThe bigger Bakuninist organization lasted longer than its small Marxist rival, which was only in New York. Bakunin promoted the basic ideas of syndicalism and of anarchism. From 1870 to 1876, Bakunin wrote some of his longer writings, such as \"Statism and Anarchy\" and \"God and the State\".\nThe Paris Commune fitted many elements of Bakunin's anarchist programme \u2013 self-management, mandated delegates, a militia system with elected officers, and decentralisation. Even though he was old and sick, Bakunin also tried to join anarchists in Bologna, Italy, but was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise, where he lived in Lugano. He stayed active in the worker's and peasant's movements of Europe and he also influenced movements in Egypt and Latin America."}

People from around the world can use it to have conversations together. It can also be used for two people to chat privately.\nThe IRC chat rooms are also called \"IRC channels\". These channels are on IRC servers, which you can connect to by finding that server's information. This information will often begin with \"irc,\" then a period, the name of the server, then another period, and finally, .com .org or .net. An example would be 'irc.[Servername].org'\nThere are small IRC servers (for example, OperaNet) to medium IRC servers (freenode and DalNet, which have about 30,000 users) and big IRC servers (for example, EFNet, UnderNet, which have over 100,000 users).\nUsers of IRC need an IRC client. An IRC client is a computer program that works with IRC. There are many clients. Some of these clients run in the web browser. Other clients run as an application. Popular stand-alone clients include mIRC for Microsoft Windows, and XChat for Linux and Microsoft Windows. The Opera web browser has an IRC client built into the browser. ChatZilla is a chat client which is a plugin to Mozilla Firefox.\nAn IRC bot is a computer program that helps control and protect channels.\nThe name of an IRC channel usually begins with a hash (#).\nTechnical information.\nIRC is an open protocol that uses TCP and optionally TLS. An IRC server can connect to other IRC servers to expand the IRC network. Users access IRC networks by connecting a client to a server. There are many client and server programs. Most IRC servers do not require users to log in, but a user will have to set a nickname before being connected.\nIRC was originally a plain text protocol (although later extended), which on request was assigned network port 194/TCP by IANA. However, most servers now run IRC on 6667/TCP and nearby port numbers (for example TCP ports 6112-6119) so that the server does not have to be run with root privileges.\nIRC clients.\nThis is a list of some programs which allow users to connect to IRC."}

{"id": "16390", "revid": "590442", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16390", "title": "Leaf", "text": "A leaf is an above-ground plant organ and it is green. Its main functions are photosynthesis and gas exchange. A leaf is often flat, so it absorbs the most light, and thin, so that the sunlight can get to the chloroplasts in the cells. Most leaves have stomata, which open and close. They regulate carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water vapour exchange with the atmosphere.\nPlants with leaves all year round are evergreens, and those that shed their leaves are deciduous. Deciduous trees and shrubs generally lose their leaves in autumn. Before this happens, the leaves change colour. The leaves will grow back in spring. Leaves are normally green in color, which comes from chlorophyll found in the chloroplasts. Plants that lack chlorophyll cannot photosynthesize.\nLeaves come in many shapes and sizes. The biggest undivided leaf is that of a giant edible arum. This lives in marshy parts of the tropical rain forest of Borneo. One of its leaves can be ten feet across and have a surface area of over 30 square feet (~2.8 sq. metres).\nHowever, leaves are always thin so carbon dioxide can diffuse quickly to all cells.\nAnatomy.\nA leaf is a plant organ and is made up of a collection of tissues in a regular organisation. The major tissue systems present are:\nEpidermis.\nThe epidermis is the outer layer of cells covering the leaf. It forms the boundary separating the plant's inner cells from the external environment.\nThe epidermis is covered with pores called \"stomata\". Each pore is surrounded on each side by chloroplast-containing guard cells, and two to four subsidiary cells that lack chloroplasts. Opening and closing of the stoma complex regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf. This allows photosynthesis, without letting the leaf dry out.\nMesophyll.\nMost of the interior of the leaf between the upper and lower layers of epidermis is a tissue called the mesophyll (Greek for \"middle leaf\"). This assimilation tissue is the main place photosynthesis takes place in the plant. The products of photosynthesis are sugars, which can be turned into other products in plant cells.\nIn ferns and most flowering plants, the mesophyll is divided into two layers: \nPlants with leaves all year round are evergreens, and those that shed their leaves are deciduous. Deciduous trees and shrubs generally lose their leaves in autumn. Before this happens, the leaves change colour. The leaves will grow back in spring.\nVeins.\nThe 'veins' are a dense network of xylem, which supply water for photosynthesis, and phloem, which remove the sugars produced by photosynthesis. The pattern of the veins is called 'venation'. \nIn angiosperms the pattern of venation differs in the two main groups. Venation is usually is parallel in monocotyledons, but is an interconnecting network in broad-leaved plants (dicotyledons). \nHairs.\nMany leaves are covered in trichomes (small hairs) which have a wide range of structures and functions. Some trichomes are prickles, some are scaled, some secrete substances such as oil. Carnivorous plants secrete digestive enzymes from trichomes.\nWaxy Cuticle.\nThe waxy cuticle is the waterproof, transparent outer surface of the leaf. It is waterproof to reduce water loss (transpiration) and transparent to allow light to enter the palisade cell. \nShape.\nWhat leaves look like on the plant varies greatly. Closely related plants have the same kind of leaves because they have all descended from a common ancestor. The terms for describing leaf shape and pattern is shown, in illustrated form, at Wikibooks.\nArrangement on the stem.\nDifferent terms are usually used to describe leaf placement (phyllotaxis):\nLeaves form a helix pattern centered around the stem, with (depending upon the species) the same angle of divergence. There is a regularity in these angles and they follow the numbers in a Fibonacci sequence. This tends to give the best chance for the leaves to catch light.\nDivisions of the blade.\nTwo basic forms of leaves can be described considering the way the blade (lamina) is divided. \nPetioles.\nSome leaves have a petiole (leaf stem). Sessile leaves do not: the blade attaches directly to the stem. Sometimes the leaf blad surrounds the stem, giving the impression that the shoot grows through the leaf.\nIn some \"Acacia\" species, such as the Koa Tree (\"Acacia koa\"), the petioles are expanded or broadened and function like leaf blades; these are called phyllodes. There may or may not be normal pinnate leaves at the tip of the phyllode.\nStipules.\nA stipule, present on the leaves of many dicotyledons, is an appendage on each side at the base of the petiole resembling a small leaf. Stipules may be shed or not shed.\nLeaf adaptations.\nIn the course of evolution, many species have leaves which are adapted to other functions."}

The movie was based on Robert C. O'Brien's children's book \"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\". (The main character's name was changed to \"Brisby\", so that its audiences would not take its sound for the Frisbee toy.) Bluth began the idea of creating this movie after disagreement with Disney over \"The Fox and the Hound\". Before that he worked with the previous Disney animated movie which was also about mice: \"The Rescuers\". Later he made another animated movie about mice called \"An American Tail\", which came out in 1986.\nThe story.\nA widow mouse lives with her children (Martin, Teresa, Cynthia and Timothy). On her journey, she meets a comic, love-seeking crow, a group of rats and the National Institute of Mental Health. After the deaths of the enemy leader and magician, a magical amulet manipulates and restores a house shaped stone block from drowning in the mud. Bluth and Gold\u00adman's next film, \"All Dogs Go to Heaven\", also used digital coloring via CAPS.\nReception.\nIn spite of its critical success, this movie had a mediocre run at the box office, mostly because of a much bigger rival, Steven Spielberg's E. T. (Ironically, Spielberg saw the Bluth movie and asked its director to work on \"An American Tail\".)\nMany fans and critics have called \"NIMH\" Don Bluth's most important work and magnum opus and masterpiece. Even though this movie was not a big box office success, \"An American Tail\" and 1997's \"Anastasia\" became his most successful works in later years. The next day, however, Bluth approved of the idea for possible development, along with \"Rock-a-Doodle\".\nSequel.\nIn 1998, MGM released a direct-to-video sequel called \"The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue\". In the sequel, Timothy goes to a place called Thorn Valley because he wants to become a hero like his father. His brother Martin has turned evil (although he does not want to), and Timothy must fight him in order to save the Rats of NIMH. At Thorn Valley Timothy learns from a young girl mouse that the mice who were thought to have been killed during the escape from NIMH are still alive, so he and the rats try to rescue them.\nThe sequel was hated by the fans of the first movie and the movie critics because of its clich\u00e9d and familiar storyline, and because many people thought that the magic of Don Bluth's dark and original \"NIHM\" was destroyed by the sequel, because MGM toned down the darkness of the story."}

In the Korean alphabet hangeul, \"\ud0dc\" (\u8dc6) signifies \"to strike with the foot\"; \"\uad8c\" (\u62f3) to \"strike with the hand\"; and \"\ub3c4\" (\u9053) signifies \"way\", \"road\" or \"route\". \"Taekwondo\" can therefore be translated as \"way of the foot and of the fist\".\nTaekwondo refers to a great tradition of Korean martial arts (higher or under 2000 years), but exists in its current form only near 50 years. Today, it has been changed into a sport practiced very much. In the Olympic Games of Seoul 1988 and of Barcelona 1992 it became Olympic sport of exhibition and at present it has come to be Olympic sport of competition.\nFeatures.\nTaekwondo is best known for its use of kicks. This makes it different from other martial arts such as karate or certain forms of southern kung-fu. Kicking is important because the leg is the most powerful and longest body part that the martial artist can use as a weapon. Therefore, a fighter who kicks well can hurt his opponent without hurting himself.\nOne of the most important exercises is the act of doing \"poomse\" (\"katas\" in terminology of karate). The \"poomses\" are the arranged groups of movements of defense and of attack. They simulate a combat against diverse adversaries, and they are related directly to the different degrees of belts. They are done with the purpose to improve the equilibrium, the elasticity, the rapidity and the control of the different movements.\nTaekwondo as a sport and as a form of exercise is popular among people of both sexes and many ages. Taekwondo develops force, speed, balance, flexibility, and stamina. It also involves mental focus. Breaking boards, for example, demonstrates a union of mental and physical discipline. Breaking a board with one's hand or foot requires both the physical mastery of the technique and a concentrated focus on one's force.\nHistory.\nEven though some things in Tae Kwon Do have changed over the years, respect is not one of those things. Respect is the biggest part of Tae Kwon Do. Without respect Tae Kwon Do would not be the huge art it is today. Some of the things that have changed are the belts. The original colors are still the same, but every time you test you either receive a new belt or receive a stripe to place on you current belt. Legend has it that long ago there was just one belt. There still were colors though: white, the color the belt was originally; yellow, the color achieved thorough sweat soaking into the belt; green, a color that came though practicing outside and falling; blue, the color of the sky; red, the color of blood; and black, the color of all the dirt mixing with everything else on the belt.\nTaekwondo associations.\nThere are several world-wide Taekwondo associations. The most known of them are:"}

It is a popular kind of fast food in some parts of the world. As the name says, it is made of chips and a deep fried fish fillet.\nShops and restaurants that have fish and chips are easy to find in Australia and New Zealand. They are most common in England. The first Fish and Chips were found in the East end of London in the late 19th Century. So they are not as traditional as we think.\nThe fish.\nTraditionally, cod, haddock, or (rarely) flounder are used to make fish and chips. Of these, cod is by far the most popular. Other fish with white meat can be used as well, for example whiting or plaice. Many places that serve fish and chips have more than one kind of fish. The customers can then choose what kind of fish they want...\nThe fish is always dipped in batter, which is a kind of liquid mixture which hardens upon frying. After that, it will be fried for a short time. The phrase 'fish &amp; chips' implies that it will be fried in batter; of course, in a fish restaurant, grilling or boiling would be alternatives. Fish cooked like that do not have batter. Typically Fish and Chips is eaten with lots of vinegar and salt. \nThe chips.\nThe chips are made from sliced potatoes. They are larger than French fries. Large slices of potatoes are fried.\nOther side-dishes.\nVery often there are other side-dishes that are served with Fish and chips (also called a 'chippie' or 'fish shop'). They include mushy peas, onions, gherkins(which are baby cucumbers),baked beans and saveloys (long sausages). Sometimes, you can ask for 'scrapings' which are the bits of crunchy batter that have fallen off the fish when it was frying.\nIn Northern England there is also the variety chips and gravy (a little sauce) on the chips. It is less common in the rest of the country but sometimes you can also find 'curry sauce' in other parts of the UK. In Australia and New Zealand, fish and chip takeaway shops often offer sides like corn dogs and grilled cheese sandwich's.\nOther things to note.\nFish and chips are also sold out of mobile shops. Very often the shops and restaurants that serve fish and chips do not have a license to serve alcohol. Some nutritionists criticize fish and chips, because the meal contains a large amount of fat."}

Marx's theories explain the \"laws of motion\" of production and exchange under capitalism. This theory was used to argue against the middle class theories of economics common at that time. Marx wanted this to be a tool for the working class (the proletariat) to use to overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism, then with communism. Socialism, would be a step towards the disappearance of the state, and communism would be, according to Marx, a society where goods and services would be distributed \"to each according to his need, from each according to his ability.\"\nMarxist used the Labor Theory of Value, which says that the value of a commodity is determined by the labor required to produce it. More specifically, Marx defined the value of a commodity as the Socially necessary labor time required to produce it, the average (taken across all of society) time required to produce a given commodity under the average conditions of production. It follows from this that the [working class] is responsible for the production of all of the [value] (wealth) consumed by all members of society.\nMarx viewed the capitalist class (the bourgeoisie), those who control the means of production, as leech-like and unnecessary; they are not necessary for the production of the goods society must consume in order to meet human needs and reproduce itself. Rather, Marx saw the capitalist class as getting wealth for itself by the exploitation of the working class. Marx argued that wages under capitalism are determined not by the value created by workers during a given period of time, but by the cost of their labor power (ability to work). He argued that the cost of labor power is determined by the cost of the goods and services (food, clothing, shelter, child care, education etc.) nececssary to maintain and reproduce workers. So, capitalists do not pay workers for the value they create: they extract Surplus value, the difference between the value created by a worker and the cost of their labor power (their wages), from the working class. In other words, surplus value is unpaid labor performed by the working class for the capitalist class, which Marx termed exploitation.\nMarx argued that because the capitalist class enriches itself by the exploitation of the working class, the economic interests of the two classes are opposed and therefore incompatible. He saw the dispossession of the capitalists and the seizure of control of the means of production by the working class as historically progressive in that it would bring about the end of class society, remove the contradictions inherent under capitalism (a result of the antagonism of the two major classes, the bourgeoisie and proletariat), and qualitatively increase the scope of human development in many areas."}

It was produced by Nelvana Limited of Canada, and was distributed by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. It was the first in a trilogy(or set of three) of big-screen movies that had the Care Bears in lead roles, and the first to be based directly on a toy line. The movie's success led to a spin-off television series that premiered on ABC a year after its release.\nThere were well-known celebrities among the movie's starring line-up, such as Carole King, who wrote and sung its opening theme. John Sebastian and NRBQ also contributed to its score. The movie also had the voices of Mickey Rooney, Canadian actress Georgia Engel, and voice actress Cree Summer.\nIt was made as a full-length commercial for the title toys, and had mixed views from critics. But its $23 million gross at the box office made it the biggest animated work outside the Disney market when it came out. It is one of the most profitable releases in the animation industry (its cost was $3 million). The movie saved Nelvana from closing down when \"Rock &amp; Rule\", the company's first production, did not do well.\nFacts.\nThe Care Bears Movie holds financial records for non-Disney animation (at the time it first came out), for Canadian moviemaking (only rivalled by \"Porky's\" and, more recently, \"The Wild\"), and for its distributor Samuel Goldwyn.\nIts director, Arna Selznick, was one of three women to ever lead the production for a full-length cartoon. To this day, she is proud of these efforts, though she was aware of the strategy to promote it.\nPlot.\nIn this movie, an orphanage caretaker named Mr. Cherrywood tells the story of how the Care Bears come to help two children who do not care for anyone (Kim and Jason). The Care Bears live in Care-a-lot, a cloud-filled place up in the sky. As the two of them become friends with the Bears, a carnival magician's helper, Nicholas, turns from good to bad, because of an evil spirit he got from an old book.\nWhen the boy's evil grows more and more, the Care Bears and their Cousins (from the Forest of Feelings), along with Kim and Jason, come back to Earth to end his evil doings. In turn, the carnival and the whole world will be saved."}

Its capital, largest and most-populated city is Melbourne. Geelong is Victoria's second biggest city, Ballarat is the third and Bendigo the fourth.\nAt the end of 2015 Victoria's population was an estimated 5,996,400. After British settlement in Australia in 1788, it was called the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. In 1851, it became an independent colony. It was named after Queen Victoria. In 1901 it became a state in Australia.\nVictoria's premier is Daniel Andrews from the Labor Party.\nTransport.\nVictoria has the highest population density of a state in Australia. Highways lead to and from population centres, mainly Melbourne and other major cities. Rail transport in Victoria is common. Major railway line operators include Metro Trains Melbourne, V/Line and Pacific National.\nMelbourne Airport is the biggest domestic and international airport for Victoria. It is linked to Melbourne by the Tullamarine Freeway.\nThe Port of Melbourne is the largest port for cargo in Australia, located in Melbourne near Yarra River. Additional seaports are at Westernport Bay, Geelong, and Portland.\nTourism.\nMelbourne.\nSee main article Melbourne.\nThe city of Melbourne has many attractions, including shopping, the Crown Casino, Melbourne Zoo, Melbourne Museum, Melbourne Aquarium, Melbourne Docklands, Southbank and St. Kilda. Melbourne is also the home of cultural and sporting icons such as The Arts Centre, National Gallery of Victoria and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) which held the 1956 Summer Olympic Games.\nOther.\nThe historic cities of Ballarat, Beechworth, Bendigo, Castlemaine, Maldon and Daylesford which were all towns built on the goldfields during the 1850s.\nNatural attractions include The Twelve Apostles on the Great Ocean Road, Wilson's Promontory, The Grampians, Buchan Caves, Gippsland Lakes and the penguins on Phillip Island. The Dandenong Ranges just east of Melbourne has the Puffing Billy Railway and Healesville Sanctuary.\nThe Murray River which is the state's northern border, has towns including Echuca and Mildura. Boating, fishing and other water sports are popular along the river.\nGeelong, south west of Melbourne on Corio Bay, has many beaches, and hosts the Australian International Airshow. Nearby is the Bellarine Peninsula, which has many famous beaches such as Bells Beach, Torquay and Queenscliff.\nThe Mornington Peninsula is well known for its beaches and wineries.\nThe Victorian Alpine Region in the Australian Alps is popular for skiing with resorts at Falls Creek, Mount Hotham, and Mount Buffalo.\nSport.\nVictoria is the home of AFL, with ten of the eighteen clubs of the Australian Football League based in Victoria. The traditional Grand Final is held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on the last Saturday in September.\nVictoria's cricket team, the Victorian Bushrangers play in the national Pura Cup cricket competition.\nVictoria has one team each represented in the National Rugby League and the Australian Rugby Championship, the Melbourne Storm and Melbourne Rebels respectively.\nClimate.\nVictoria's climate varies greatly despite its small size. It ranges from the snowfields in the north east where the temperatures can be below freezing, to the dry semi-arid Mallee area of the north west where it can get very hot.\nOverall, the southern position of Victoria means it tends to be a bit cooler and wetter than the other Australian mainland states.\nThe hottest temperature recorded in Victoria was 48.8\u00a0\u00b0C at Hopetoun, on the 9 February, 2009.\nThe coldest temperature recorded in Victoria was -11.7\u00a0\u00b0C at Omeo, on 15 June, 1965.\nThe highest daily rainfall was 375mm at Tanbryn, on 22 March, 1983.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nVictoria was the scene of much volcanic activity which started 40 million years ago. The Western Volcanic Plains which cover 10% of the state are the third largest volcanic plains in the world. Most of the plains were formed about six million years ago. There are about 400 volcanoes on the plains.\nIt is unknown exactly when humans settled in Victoria. A site near Keilor has evidence of Australian Aborigines living near on the Maribyrnong River more than 31,000 years ago. Victoria was one of the most populated areas of Australia. The Aborigines used fire-stick farming to burn the volcanic plains regularly, and they became some of the biggest grass plains in the world. This supported large numbers of animals such as kangaroos and wallabies. The Kulin federation were a large language group that lived on the plains and included the Watha wurrung, Boon wurrung, Woi wurrung, Daung wurrung and Djadja wurrung people. Other groups in Victoria included the Jari Jari, Ladji Ladji, Wemba Wemba, Wergaia, Jardwadjali, Gunnai, Waywurru and the Taungurung. In the rivers, creeks and wetlands the Aboriginals had built large fish traps to catch both fish and eels. In the Yarra River wetlands, some of these traps had stone walls about high.\nEuropean settlement.\nFirst attempts.\nWithin ten years of the British settlement at Sydney in 1788, explorers began looking at the coast of Victoria. The first settlement in Victoria was at Sorrento, just inside the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. A small group of 51 soldiers, 308 convicts, 17 free settlers, 12 officials, one missionary and his wife, led by Lieutenant-Governor David Collins set up camp at the end of 1803. They had come from England to set up a colony because the British government was worried that the French may try to claim the area. However they were unable to find water and gave up the settlement within six weeks. They went further south and began the settlement of Hobart, Tasmania. While at Sorrento, a convict named William Buckley escaped. He lived with Aboriginal tribes until meeting with Europeans again when Melbourne was settled in 1835. On 12 December 1826, Captain Samuel Wright, Lieutenant Burchill, explorer William Hovell and 21 convicts tried to start a settlement near Corinella, on Westernport Bay. This was also unsuccessful and the group went back to Sydney on 19 February 1828.\nAlthough the two official attempts to settle in Victoria had failed, there were a number of unofficial settlements along the coast. From 1820 small groups of people lived at various places along the south coast, including Phillip Island. They were hunting seals and Southern Right Whales. The Launceston Fishing Company had a base at Portland Bay. These hunters were often in conflict with the Aboriginal communities. The Europeans often captured Aboriginal women to use as slaves and for sex. Edward Henty moved to Portland Bay and began sheep farming in December 1834. These settlements were against the law, as the British government was trying to restrict the areas of settlement. They argued that they did not have the ability to provide support to remote and isolated settlements. Repeated requests for official permission to settle in Victoria were refused by the government.\nJohn Batman.\nIn 1835 a group of settlers, farmers and government officials from Tasmania formed the Port Phillip Association. Led by John Batman, who had heard about the grass plains from William Hovell, the group decided to ignore the British government and move flocks of sheep to Victoria. Batman landed at Indented Head, Victoria on 29 May 1835. He began exploring Port Phillip Bay. On 6 June 1835 he met with Aboriginal leaders near Merri Creek, and made a treaty. Under this treaty the Aboriginals agreed to allow Batman to use their land for his sheep. In return, they could continue to stay on the land, they would be provided with food and goods, and they would receive protection from other Europeans. This was the only treaty ever made with the Australian Aborigines. On 26 August 1835, the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Richard Bourke, said the treaty was against the law. The land belonged to the crown, and did not belong to the Aboriginals.\nAt the end of 1835, the British government changed its policy on settlement in eastern Australia. People were allowed to use large areas of the country for sheep farming. If people paid a \u00a310 fee, they could settle wherever they liked. These farmers became known as \"squatters\", as they \"sat\" on the land, which they did not own. The effect of this new policy meant that between 1835 and 1838, more land was settled than had been since 1788. It has been described as the fastest land occupation in history. By 1849, just 1019 squatters had taken over 17.7 million hectares of land.\nThe effect of the fast land occupation had terrible consequences for the Victorian Aborigines. The squatters moved their sheep onto the grasslands that had once been the Aborigines main source of food. The squatters built their farms near the waterholes and creeks where the Aborigines had camped for thousands of years. The Aborigines began to kill sheep to eat, and attempted to stop people from taking their land. The early settlers tried to remove the Aborigines from the land. Sometimes they were chased away, and sometimes they were murdered. For example, at Murdering Creek, near Camperdown, 35-40 men, women and children were shot dead by the manager of Glenorminston Station, Frederick Taylor and several of his farm workers.\nGold.\nGold was found in Victoria at Clunes on 28 June 1851. With further discoveries at Ballarat, Bendigo and Castlemaine there was a huge increase in the population as people came from all around the world."}

It looks at certain systems that are very sensitive. A very small change may make the system behave completely differently. \nVery small changes in the starting position of a chaotic system make a big difference after a while. This is why even large computers cannot tell the weather for more than a few days in the future. Even if the weather was perfectly measured, a small change or error will make the prediction completely wrong. Since even a butterfly can make enough wind to change weather, a chaotic system is sometimes called the \"butterfly effect\". No computer knows enough to tell how the small wind will change the weather.\nSome systems (like weather) might appear random at first look, but chaos theory says that these kinds of systems or patterns may not be. If people pay close enough attention to what is really going on, they might notice the chaotic patterns.\nThe main idea of chaos theory is that a minor difference at the start of a process can make a major change in it as time progresses. Quantum chaos theory is a new idea in the study of chaos theory. It deals with quantum physics.\nExamples.\nAs an example, take a pendulum that is attached at some point, and swings freely. Connecting a second pendulum to the first will make the system completely different. It is very hard to start in exactly the same position again - a change in starting position so small that it cannot even be seen can quickly cause the pendulum swing to become different from what it was before. \nA very important part to the study of chaos theory is the study of mathematics functions that are known as \"fractals\". Fractal functions work like chaotic systems: a small change in the starting values can change the value of the function in ways that look random. Due to the fact that they are mathematical, they are easy to study."}

The movie stars the voices of Ming-Na Wen and Eddie Murphy. \"Mulan\" was a success with its fans because it was different from Disney's other movies in terms of music and artistic design. The music was written by Jerry Goldsmith who also wrote the music for another animated movie, 1982's \"The Secret of NIMH\". Christina Aguilera sang \"Reflections\" or the movie's soundtrack. A direct-to-video sequel, \"Mulan II\", was released on February 1, 2005.\nIn 2018, Disney announced that they were making a live action remake.\nStory.\nAn army of Huns, led by Shan Yu, arrive and try to invade China.
