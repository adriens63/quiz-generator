It is a kind of Chinese food. Examples are xiaolongbao, spiced broad beans, and hairy crabs.\nDumplings.\nXiaolongbao.\nA xiaolongbao is a small kind of dumpling. It is made of a flour skin wrapped around a ball of pork, crabmeat, shrimp, or bok choy and other vegetables. It is steamed in a small basket called a \"xiaolong\", which gives the dumpling its name. The steam and meat together create some soup inside the dumpling. It was first made in Nanxiang in northwestern Shanghai, but the man who made it first later moved his shop to Yu Garden to get more business.\nWontons.\nWontons are a kind of dumpling with a meat center inside a thin skin that is made of flour, egg, water, and salt. The Shanghainese kinds come in two sizes, \"small\" and \"big\". The small wontons are wrapped loosely by hand and eaten for breakfast. The big wontons are wrapped carefully and eaten for lunch or dinner. Both kinds are often filled with minced pork and bok choy and served in chicken soup, but restaurants sometimes have as many as 50 different fillings. A well-known special kind is \"Three-Freshness Soup\" \"s\u0101nxi\u0101n t\u0101ng\"), made with pork, shrimp, and fish.\nMeat.\nHongshao pork.\nHongshao pork is made of pork and a special sauce made of soy sauce, flour, and sugar.\nHongshao snakefish is cooked the same way, but usually with more spring onions.\n\"White cut chicken\".\n\"White cut chicken\" (\u767d\u65ac\u96de, \u767d\u65a9\u9e21, \"b\u00e1izh\u01cenj\u012b\") is chicken that is soaked in salt water, poached for about 30 minutes, chilled, and then cut into strips. People usually think of it as a Cantonese food but Shanghai has its own kind, eaten with a soy ginger sauce. It is usually eaten without the head, neck, or feet and locals prefer the dark meat in the thighs, legs, and back to the white meat in the breast, but all of them can be eaten at home or in restaurants.\nThe Shanghainese kind of white cut chicken prefers \"triple yellow\" chickens with yellow beaks, skin, and feet. It is closely tied to the Xiao Shaoxing Restaurant (\u5c0f\u7d39\u8208, \u5c0f\u7ecd\u5174, \"Xi\u01ceosh\u00e0ox\u012bng\", \"Little Shaoxing\") on Yunnan Road near People's Square. Zhang Runniu was a 16-year-old boy who left his home in Shaoxing during the Second World War. He worked hard for a few years and then bought his own small shop in 1943. His kind of poached chicken became famous in the city: his restaurant remains open today and its favorite dish is copied in other restaurants and kitchens around the city. His yellow chickens are grown using a special set of food on farms in Pudong's Nanhui area. The dish can be so rare that blood still comes from the bones in the chicken after cooking and cooling. More people like the cool chicken during the hot summer, but many stayed away from it during the 2013 bird flu scare.\nSeafood.\nHairy crab.\nShanghainese hairy crab \"m\u00e1oxi\u00e8\") is a kind of mitten crab. It lives in rivers and lakes near Shanghai. The most famous place to get it is Yangcheng Lake near Suzhou. It is usually steamed and then cooked with huangjiu and soy sauce.\nYoubao shrimp.\nYoubao shrimp (, \"y\u00f3ub\u00e0oxi\u0101\") is a kind of fried shrimp. It uses a special sauce made of soy sauce, vinegar, scallions, salt, and black and red pepper. Its name comes from the loud popping noises that it makes when you cook it.\nVegetables.\nSpiced broad beans.\nSpiced broad beans are made of beans flavored with aniseed and cinnamon. They are sweet. Nearly everyone knows them. It has a long history. A person named Zhang Acheng (\u5f35\u963f\u6210) made this food sixty years ago.\nCold congee.\nCold congee (\u7cd6\u7ca5) is a kind of congee (rice porridge) that is made of glutinous rice, red beans, and sugar. They are boiled together, then chilled to serve as a breakfast food.\nTofu pudding.\nAlthough people usually think of Shanghai as part of southern Chinese culture, Shanghainese tofu pudding follows the northern salty \"tofu brains\" ( \"d\u00f2un\u01ceo\") and not the southern sweet \"tofu flower\" ( \"d\u00f2uhu\u0101\") way of cooking it. It is made from an extra soft kind of tofu. In Shanghai, it is often eaten with soy sauce, shrimp, seaweed, or zhacai.\nDrinks.\nDoujiang.\nDoujiang is the older, watery kind of soy milk. It can be sweet, salty, or plain.\nSome doujiang is always made when people make tofu, but Chinese people didn't start to like it until the 18th century. Raw doujiang has the same kinds of things in it that make people fart a lot when they eat too many beans. During the Qing, people found out that you could get rid of those things by cooking the doujiang for 90\u00a0minutes or so. After that, it became very popular. Some people sold it in the street, and others bought it fresh from tofu shops. By the Republic, Shanghai had 2 doujiang factories producing thousands of bottles a day.\nCandies.\nPear-syrup candy.\nPear-syrup candy (\u68a8\u818f\u7cd6, \"l\u00edg\u0101ot\u00e1ng\") is a kind of candy made with pear syrup. Wei Zheng (\u9b4f\u5f81) is said to have first made it as a medicine for his mother's cough in the year 634 during the Tang Dynasty. Shanghainese pear-syrup candy began in three shops in the city's old walled city during the Qing Dynasty: Zhupinzhai (opened 1855), Yongshengtang (opened 1882), and Deshengtang (opened 1904). These shops joined together in 1956 to form the Shanghai Pear-Syrup Candy Food Factory (\u4e0a\u6d77\u68a8\u818f\u7cd6\u98df\u54c1\u5382), which makes its candy at a factory in Pudong but still sells it from a store in the market around Shanghai's City God Temple. It remains a common souvenir for visitors to the city. Now, it is usually flavored with fruit or pinenuts, but it is also made with mint, ham, or rose. In traditional Chinese medicine, the candy is used for easing coughs and sore throats, reducing mucus, and increasing appetite.\nBegonia cake.\nBegonia cake \"h\u01ceit\u00e1ngg\u0101o\") is a Chinese pastry. It is made of dough filled with red bean paste and covered with preserved fruit pieces, sunflower and sesame seeds, and barley sugar. Stands in Qibao and at Yu Garden sometimes use lard or peanuts. It is baked in a mold shaped like the flower of the flowering crabapple tree. It is more popular with older Shanghainese than younger ones.\nWhite Rabbit milk candy.\nWhite Rabbit is a kind of soft milk candy first made in Shanghai. It is made from milk, sugar, and some chemicals that make it last longer. It was called \"Mickey Mouse\" candy when people first made it in 1943, but they changed it to \"White Rabbit\" later. It was cheap and became very popular. After China's melamine scandal, people in other countries stopped buying it until White Rabbit began to use milk from Australia and New Zealand instead of China."}

To go to consultations, at a specialist of psychoanalysis [was a voluntary decision by Hamsun]; he went to Johannes Irgens Str\u00f8mme() - who had been a student of Oskar Pfister()\n- from 4 January 1926.\nDuring a two year period, Hamsun made visits to Str\u00f8mme; Hamsun would lie on a divan [or a couch-like sitting furniture] while being psychoanalyzed, and Str\u00f8mme would sit (on a chair) behind Hamsun.\nIn 1926 the writer's block eased, and the year after he published the novel \"Wayfarers\";\nHe thanked the psychoanalyst \"for the rest of Hamsun's life\", for getting back his apetite for writing. \nNon-voluntary psychiatry.\nDuring the Legal purge in Norway after World War II()\n, Hamsun was examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist - without Hamsun giving permission for the examinations;\n[part of the diagnosis ] of Hamsun said that he had [a permanent reduction of sanity ] \"varig svekkede sjelsevner\";\nto disprove and discredit the diagnosis, Hamsun wrote \"On Overgrown Paths\"() (published in 1949);\nStorage of the notes.\nThe notes by psychoanalyst Str\u00f8mme, were [years later] \"left to\" a friend (of the psychoanalyst) - \u00d8rnulf Myklestad; this friend was also the publisher of works by the psychoanalyst;\nOn a document dated 1958, Myklestad wrote that he would not do anything while Hamsun's widow was alive;\nthe notes were put in safe deposit box (at a bank);\nOut of the safe deposit box, the notes came in the autumn of 1978; \nThe daughter of psychoanalyst Str\u00f8mme had the shorthand notes, transferred to her.\nInterpreting and transcribing the notes.\nThe stenographied notes were [borrowed] by [publishing house] Gyldendal() for more than two months; Gyldendal returned the notes [together with a letter dated] 18 January 1979; \"with the help of a stenographer employed by Norway's parliament\", Gyldendal was able to interpret 30 pages of the shorthand notes, and Gyldendal transcribed those (in 1979); [in the letter, the female stenographer said that more] deciphering could be achieved - but it probably would take years and it would be expensive.\nAttempts at publication (of psychoanalysis).\nThe interest in the notes regarding Hamsun, reached a climax [or top point] in 2001, when several groups [of people] wanted to use the notes.\nA letter was sent - sometime before 2 April 2001 - from the national library, to the Ministry of Justice, regarding the library's [idea] to publicize the [notes regarding the] psychoanalysis ([that was] performed by Str\u00f8mme); the notes were to be publicized together with comments from literary scientists and psychoanalysts; the project was to be led by Atle Kittang() - an expert (on research regarding Hamsun) and a professor of literature.\nMedia wrote about the letter; psychiatrist Sigmund Karterud() said (on 2 July) that psychiatrists [as a group] are shocked; However, the spokesman for the Hamsun family - Leif Hamsun (a grandchild of Knut Hamsun) - said that the project was not problematic.\nProject by publishing house Gyldendal; the stopping of a project by \"the national library\".\nAt the same time, a major project was started by Gyldendal: Ingar Sletten Kolloen() was [expected] to write a significant biography about Hamsun;\na group of people were put together by Kolloen [to help him]: members of the group included literary scientists and experts of psychoanalysis; the group included psychiatrist Sigmund Karterud();\nThe national library cancelled plans to publish the psychoanalysis notes, media said on 23 September 2001; furthermore, Kolloen was granted access to the psychoanalysis notes, because of Gyldendal's plans for him to write a biography (about Hamsun); \nPublication.\nNotes from Hamsun's psychoanalyst, were published in 2017; the photocopied notes were from [Hamsun's appointments] with his psychoanalyst; the published notes were part of [a work of] art that was published in Vagant()\n[a magazine].\nThe publication of the psychoanalyst's notes regarding Hamsun, is controversial (as of 2017).\nIn 2017 Morgenbladet() asked \"Why at all, are the notes owned by the public\".\nCurrent possession by \"the national library\"; change of status permitting publication.\nThe notes are deposited (as of 2017) at [\"the national library\" -] Nasjonalbiblioteket in Oslo, Norway;\nthey are part of a package, [that the national library calls] \"manus 4\u00b03565\".\nThe \"national library\" (when it was called \"Universitetsbiblioteket\") received the notes, as a gift from the daughter of psychoanalyst Str\u00f8mme.\nStatus permitting publication.\nIn 1999 the daughter of psychoanalyst Str\u00f8mme, permitted publication of the notes; previously she had put a clause in place that had prevented publication of the notes;\nBy 2003, no one seems to have discovered [and made use of the general availability of the notes]."}

It was critical of Germany's policy toward the eurozone crisis. Some candidates who were part of the \"Electoral Alternative 2013\" ran for election in Lower Saxony in alliance with the Free Voters. They then decided to form a party to compete in the 2013 federal election. The group wanted to abolish the euro, so the Free Voters refused to join forces.\nThe AfD's first supporters were economists, business leaders, journalists and former members of the Christian Democratic Union who were critical of the eurozone.\nThe AfD held their first convention on 14 April 2013. Members elected Bernd Lucke, Frauke Petry and Konrad Adam as speakers.\nIn the 2013 federal election, the party received 4.6% of the national vote with more than 2 million votes. The party did not win any seats.\nBefore the 2014 European Parliament election, the AfD held a conference on 25 January 2014 in Bavaria. They chose the slogan, \"Mut zu Deutschland\" (\"Courage [to stand up] for Germany\"). In February 2014, some AfD officials wanted to join an alliance with the hard eurosceptic party, UKIP. However, Bernd Lucke and other officials and election candidates wanted to instead join an alliance with the British Conservative Party. In the European elections, the AfD won 7 seats in the European Parliament, and joined the European Conservatives and Reformists.\nOn 4 July 2015, Frauke Petry was elected as the principal speaker of the party. She was a member of the national conservate faction within the party. Her election is seen as a shift of the party further to the right wing, as the party now began to focus on Islam and immigration. Lucke believed the party was turing into the \"PEGIDA party.\" He left the party a few days later, citing the rise of xenophobia within the party. On 19 July 2015, Lucke formed the Alliance for Progress and Renewal (ALFA).\nIn February 2016, AfD announced an alliance with the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6). On 8 March 2016, the European Conservatives and Reformists decided they will begin to exclude the AfD from their groups due to their links to the far-right FP\u00d6.\nIn 2016, the party won seats in the Berlin, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt Landtags.\nAt the AfD party conference held on 30 April to 1 May 2016, the party called for a ban on burkhas, minarets and the call to prayer, using the slogan \"Islam is not a part of Germany\".\nFrauke Petry decided not to run as the party's main candidate in the 2017 federal election. This was a consequence of the internal power struggle within the party. The party chose Alexander Gauland, a strong conservative and former member of the CDU, to lead the party in the elections. Alice Weidel, who is seen as being more moderate, was elected as his running mate. The party's platform was mainly to close the borders to asylum seekers, end sanctions on Russia and leave the European Union if Germany's national sovereignty isn't restored. After the election, the party received 5.8 million votes, winning 94 seats in the Bundestag. This is the first time the party has held seats in the Bundestag.\nA day after the successful 2017 federal election, Frauke Petry left the party. She did this as a response to extremist comments made by some members in the AfD. She would later join the Blue Party, which is another right-wing conservative party.\nBeliefs.\nThe AfD's ideology is described as populist, conservative and anti-immigration. The party is against same-sex marriage and has a platform of climate change denial. The party has also aligned itself with groups that are against modern feminism.\nAlternative for Germany is eurosceptic and critical about the influx of foreigners in Germany."}

According to this belief, heaven (\u5929, \"Tian\") stands for the natural order and will of the universe. Heaven will give a mandate to a just ruler, the Son of Heaven. If a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy, and had lost the mandate. It was also a common belief that natural disasters such as famine and flood were signs of heaven's displeasure with the ruler, so there would often be revolts after major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.\nThe Mandate of Heaven does not require a legitimate ruler to be of noble birth, and dynasties such as the Han and Ming dynasties were founded by men of common origins. The Mandate of Heaven had no time limitations, depending instead on the just and able performance of the rulers and their heirs. The concept is in some ways similar to the European concept of the divine right of kings; however, unlike the European concept, it does not confer an unconditional right to rule. The concept of Mandate of Heaven also included the right of rebellion against an unjust ruler. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that Heaven had withdrawn its mandate from the ruler. Throughout Chinese history, times of poverty and natural disasters were often taken as signs that heaven considered the current ruler unjust and in need of replacement. The Mandate of Heaven was often invoked by philosophers and scholars in China as a way to curtail the abuse of power by the ruler. \nThe concept of the Mandate of Heaven was first used to support the rule of the kings of the Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BCE), and legitimize their overthrow of the earlier Shang dynasty (1600\u20131046 BCE).

The most common content words are nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Unlike function words, content words are usually open class, which means that there is no end to how many words a part of speech in a language can have. Since content words are usually more important in a sentence, they tend to be said with more stress in an English sentence."}

A closed class of words, on the other hand, cannot add new words easily. For example, since pronouns are a closed class, there are fairly few pronouns: I, me, my, mine, myself, you, you, your, yours, yourself, he, him, his, his, himself, she, her, her, hers, herself, it, it, its, its, itself, we, us, our, ours, ourselves, they, them, their, theirs, themselves. Since pronouns are used to replace whole noun phrases, there is no need to have many kinds of pronouns. Instead of saying \"The Earl of Sandwich introduced the Earl of Sandwich's favorite food, the sandwich\", one uses the pronoun \"his\" to replace \"the Earl of Sandwich's\" to make the sentence not repeat itself when it doesn't have to, thus the sentence becomes \"The Earl of Sandwich introduced his favorite food, the sandwich\". New nouns, on the other hand, can easily be made, and are constantly being added into the English language."}

The bottom (x) axis is time, and the left (y) axis is the population or the number of people. \nBlue represents the number of susceptible people. At the beginning of the epidemic, the number of susceptible (blue) people decreases as the number of infected (green) people increases. Gradually the number of recovered (red) people increases. In this particular model, after the epidemic is over, all people have been infected and recovered. This is not always the case; sometimes, some susceptible people remain uninfected.\nThis model is also missing some parts, such as creating new susceptible people by being born and the removal of susceptible, infected, and recovered people who die. More complicated models can include these parts. \nAlso, this model does not work well for every disease. It works well where people recover from a disease and become immune, such as measles. Not all infectious diseases follow this pattern. For instance, people infected with HIV never recover, and there is no vaccine, so there is no group of recovered people, only susceptible and infected people. There is also the case where people recover from a disease but do not become immune or lose their immunity over time. For instance, when people get the flu, they are generally only immune for a short time before they become susceptible again.\nThere are also different kinds of models when as the disease is spread through the water, such as in the case of cholera, or by a vector like a mosquito, such as malaria."}

These new markets are small at first, which makes them uninteresting for established market players. If disruptive innovation is used, the market will grow at a high speed. Eventually, they will replace existing technology, though. An example of this is Flash memory. When it was introduced it was expensive, and capacities were small, compared to hard disks. On the other hand, flash memory is small, and uses little energy. It began to be used in mp3 players and usb flash drives. Eventually, it was used for Solid state disks, which started to replace hard drives.\nClayton M. Christensen first used the term in 1995: Christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers.\n\"Generally, disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward, consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than [previous] approaches. They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and unimportant to, the mainstream.\"\nReferences.\n (edit)"}

In the 19th century sabres without curved blades became common. These could be used by heavy cavalry. The last sabre to be given to US cavalry was the Patton sabre (Model 1913 Cavalry Sabre) in 1913. \nThe sabre was used as a duelling weapon in fencing in the 19th century.

After Japan surrendered, the Allies made Japan give up all the colonies they took through military force, even those before WWII started. Even though Korea was a colony of Japan before WWII, Japan still had to give it up because it used military force to take it over. So after 35 years, Korea no longer became a colony of the Empire of Japan. However, on the same day Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union invaded Korea, after having occupied Northeast China.\nThe United States and the Soviet Union occupied the country, meaning they had their military there, with the border between their zones of control along the 38th parallel, or the land on the Korean Peninsula from east to west 38 degrees North.\nWith the rise of the Cold War, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union failed to create an independent, unified Korea. In 1948, the elections led by the UN were held only in the southern part of Korea, which was occupied by the United States. This led to the creation of the Republic of Korea in South Korea, which was afterwards followed by the creation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States supported the South, and the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty, or the right to rule itself, over the whole Korean Peninsula.\nIn 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea in order to take over all of Korea, which began the Korean War. Just before North Korea took over all of Korea, the United States sent its military to take back South Korea. After it took back South Korea, the United States tried to take over North Korea until China, North Korea's communist ally, pushed back the United States. This led to a tug-of-war that lasted throughout the war. In 1953, the fighting ended in stalemate, meaning neither side won the war, and the border was once again put on the 38th parallel, but this time it became the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\nThe Korean War (1950\u20131953) left the two Koreas separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in the later part of the Cold War and even to this day.\nDue to this division, North and South Korea have become two extremely different countries. Now it has major differences between cultures, economies, health, politics, and even languages."}

{"id": "591390", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=591390", "title": "English alphabet", "text": "The modern English alphabet is a Latin alphabet of 26 letters (each having an uppercase and a lowercase form) \u2013 exactly the same letters that are found in the ISO basic Latin alphabet:\nThe exact shape of printed letters changes depending on the typeface (and font). The shape of handwritten letters can be very different from the standard printed form (and between individuals), especially when written in cursive style. See the individual letter articles for information about letter shapes and origins (follow the links on any of the uppercase letters above).\nWritten English uses 18 digraphs (strings of two letters to represent just one sound), such as \"ch, sh, th, ph, wh,\" etc., but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet. Some traditions also call two ligatures, \"\u00e6\" and \"\u0153\", and the ampersand (&amp;) part of the alphabet.\nHistory.\nOld English.\nThe English language was first written in Anglo-Saxon futhorc runes, used since the 5th century. This alphabet was brought to what is now England, along with Old English itself, the earliest form of the language, by Anglo-Saxon settlers. Very few examples of this form of written Old English have survived, with most of these being short writings or pieces.\nThe Latin script, introduced by Christian missionaries, began to replace the Anglo-Saxon futhorc from about the 7th century, although the two continued to be used alongside each other for some time. Futhorc influenced the new Latin-based English alphabet by giving it letters \"thorn\" (\u00de \u00fe) and \"wynn\" (\u01f7 \u01bf). The letter \"eth\" (\u00d0 \u00f0) was later devised as a rewriting of the letter \"dee\" (D d), and finally \"yogh\" ( ) was created by Norman scribes from the insular \"g\" in Old English and Irish, and used alongside their Carolingian \"g\".\nThe a-e ligature \"ash\" (\u00c6 \u00e6) was adopted as a letter in its own right, named after a futhorc rune \"\u00e6sc\". In very early Old English the o-e ligature \"ethel\" (\u0152 \u0153) also appeared as its own letter, likewise named after a rune, \"\u0153\u00f0el\". Also, the v-v or u-u ligature \"double-u\" (W w) was in use.\nIn the year 1011, a monk named Byrhtfer\u00f0 recorded the traditional order of the Old English alphabet. He listed the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet first (including ampersand), then 5 additional English letters, starting with the Tironian note \"ond\" (\u204a), an insular symbol for \"and\":\nModern English.\nIn the alphabet of Modern English, thorn (\u00fe), eth (\u00f0), wynn (\u01bf), yogh (), ash (\u00e6), and ethel (\u0153) do not exist. Latin borrowings reintroduced homographs of ash and ethel into Middle English and Early Modern English, though they are not thought to be the same letters but rather ligatures, and in any case are somewhat old-fashioned. Thorn and eth were both replaced by \"th\", though thorn continued in existence for some time, its lowercase form becoming more and more difficult to tell\u00a0 from the minuscule y in most handwriting. \"Y\" for \"th\" can still be seen in pseudo-archaisms (modern writings spelled to look like older words or phrases), such as \"Ye Olde Booke Shoppe\". The letters \u00fe and \u00f0 are still used in present-day Icelandic while \u00f0 is still used in present-day Faroese. Wynn disappeared from English around the 14th century when it was supplanted by \"uu\", which ultimately developed into the modern \"w\". Yogh disappeared around the 15th century and was typically replaced by \"gh\".\nIn the 16th century, the letters \"u and j\" were being written as letters distinct from \"v\" and \"i \"respectively, whereas before the former two letters were just different forms of the latter two letters. w also became its own letter, rather than be thought of as 2 different letters. With these changes, the English alphabet now has 26 letters:\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \nThe alternate lowercase form long s (\u017f) lasted into early modern English, and was used in non-final position up to the early 19th century.\nProposed reforms.\nDifferent\u00a0alphabets have been proposed for written English \u2013\nmostly extending or replacing the basic English alphabet \u2013\nsuch as the Deseret alphabet, the Shavian alphabet, Gregg shorthand, etc.\nDiacritics.\nDiacritic marks (extra marks to help non-native speakers with pronunciation) mainly appear in loanwords such as \"na\u00efve\" and \"fa\u00e7ade\". As such words become a normal part of English vocabulary, there is a tendency to remove the diacritics, as has happened with old borrowings such as \"h\u00f4tel\", from French. Informal English writing tends to get rid of diacritics because of their absence from the keyboard, while professional copywriters and typesetters tend to include them, such as Microsoft Word. Words that are still thought to be foreign tend to keep them; for example, the only spelling of \"soup\u00e7on\" found in English dictionaries (the OED and others) uses the diacritic. Diacritics are also more likely to be kept where there would otherwise be confusion with another word (for example, \"r\u00e9sum\u00e9\" (or \"resum\u00e9\") rather than \"resume\"), and, rarely, even added (as in \"mat\u00e9\", from Spanish \"yerba mate\", but following the pattern of \"caf\u00e9\", from French).\nSometimes, especially in older writing, diacritics are used to show the syllables of a word: \"cursed\" (verb) is pronounced with one syllable, while \"curs\u00e8d\" (adjective) is pronounced with two. \"\u00c8\" is used widely in poetry, e.g. in Shakespeare's sonnets. J.R.R. Tolkien uses \"\u00eb\", as in \"O wing\u00ebd crown\". Similarly, while in \"chicken coop\" the letters \"-oo-\" represent a single vowel sound (a digraph), in outdated spellings such as \"zo\u00f6logist\" and \"co\u00f6peration\", they represent two. This use of the diaeresis is rarely seen, but is still used in the 2000s in some publications, such as \"MIT Technology Review\" and \"The New Yorker\".\nAn acute, grave, or diaeresis may also be placed over an \"e\" at the end of a word to indicate that it is not silent, as in \"sak\u00e9\". In general, these markings are often not used even when they could ease some level of confusion.\nAmpersand.\nThe &amp; has sometimes appeared at the end of the English alphabet, like in Byrhtfer\u00f0's list of letters in 1011. Historically, the figure is a ligature for the letters \"Et\". In English and many other languages it is used to represent the word \"and\" and occasionally the Latin word \"et\", as in the abbreviation \"&amp;c\" (et cetera).\nApostrophe.\nThe apostrophe, while not considered part of the English alphabet, is used to contract, or shorten, English phrases. A few pairs of words, such as \"its\" (belonging to \"it\") and \"it's\" (\"it is\" or \"it has\"), \"were\" (plural of \"was\") and \"we're\" (we are), and \"shed\" (to get rid of) and \"she'd\" (\"she would\" or \"she had\") are distinguished in writing only by having or not having an apostrophe. The apostrophe also distinguishes the possessive endings \"-'s\" and \"-s'\" from the common plural ending \"-s\", a practice that began in the 18th century; before, all three endings were written \"-s\", which could lead to confusion (as in, \"the Apostles words\").\nLetter names.\nThe names of the letters are rarely spelled out, except when used in compound words (for example \"tee-shirt, deejay, emcee, okay, aitchless,\" etc.), derived forms (for example \"exed out, effing, to eff and blind\", etc.), and in the names of objects named after letters (for example \"em (space)\" in printing and \"wye (junction)\" in railroading). The forms listed below are from the Oxford English Dictionary. Vowels stand for themselves, and consonants usually have the form \"consonant + ee\" or \"e + consonant\" (e.g. \"bee\" and \"ef\"). The exceptions are the letters \"aitch, jay, kay, cue, ar, ess\" (but \"es-\" in compounds ), \"wye\", and \"zed\". Plurals of consonants end in \"-s\" (\"bees, efs, ems\") or, in the cases of \"aitch, ess\", and \"ex\", in \"-es\" (\"aitches, esses, exes\"). Plurals of vowels end in \"-es\" (\"aes, ees, ies, oes, ues\"); these are rare. Of course, all letters may stand for themselves, generally in capitalized form (\"okay\" or \"OK\", \"emcee\" or \"MC\"), and plurals may be based on these (\"aes\" or \"As\", \"cees\" or \"Cs\", etc.\")\"\nSome groups of letters, such as \"pee\" and \"bee\", or \"em\" and \"en\", are easily confused in speech, especially when heard over the telephone or a radio communications link. Spelling alphabets such as the ICAO spelling alphabet, used by aircraft pilots, police and others, are made to get rid of this confusion by giving each letter a name that sounds quite different from any other.\nEtymology.\nThe names of the letters are for the most part direct descendants of the Latin (and Etruscan) names through French.\nThe regular phonological developments (in rough chronological order) are:\nThe novel forms are \"aitch\", a regular development of Medieval Latin \"acca\"; \"jay\", a new letter presumably vocalized like neighboring \"kay\" to avoid confusion with established \"gee\" (the other name, \"jy\", was taken from French); \"vee\", a new letter named by analogy with the majority; \"double-u\", a new letter, self-explanatory (the name of Latin V was \"\u016b\"); \"wye\", of obscure origin but with an antecedent in Old French \"wi\"; \"zee\", an American leveling of \"zed\" by analogy with the majority; and \"izzard\", from the Romance phrase \"i zed\" or \"i zeto\" \"and Z\" said when reciting the alphabet.\nPhonology.\nThe letters A, E, I, O, and U are considered vowel letters, since (except when silent) they represent vowels; the remaining letters are considered consonant letters, since when not silent they generally represent consonants. However, Y commonly represents vowels as well as a consonant (e.g., \"myth\"), as very rarely does W (e.g., \"cwm\"). Conversely, U and I sometimes represent a consonant (e.g., \"quiz\" and \"onion\" respectively).\nW and Y are sometimes called semivowels by linguists.\nLetter numbers and frequencies.\nThe letter most commonly used in English is E. The least used letter is Z.\nThe table below shows the frequency of letter usage in written English, although the frequencies change somewhat according to the type of text."}

It is proved many inscriptions in the present day region of Old Khas Kingdom. There were names of Thapa warriors in pillar inscription as:\n The above inscription also proved that Thapas and Khadkas (Khadgas) had same Kshatriya father but their actual clan name was not given.\nThapas has been involved in politics of Nepal for long time. Thapas were prominent military heads in various princely states in ancient Nepal. Thapas led military and civil administration in the unified Kingdom of Nepal after 1806\u00a0AD. Bhimsen Thapa of Bagale Thapa clan rose to prominence after the assassination of King Rana Bahadur Shah of Nepal by King's step-brother in 1805\u00a0AD. After the event, an investigation was run by Bharadars (Ministers) which caused massacre of 55 senior officers at Bhandarkhal garden by Thapa Kaji (ministers) group making them as most dominant faction in Nepalese politics.\n.It would be true to say that History has been written by the Brahamin which underestimated and burried the history of all the other beautiful community of Nepal.\nAfter Bhimsen rose to power, member of another Thapa family, Bada (senior) Kaji Amar Singh Thapa and his family were added to make Thapa Khalak dynasty stronger. Large number of Thapa leaders took part in Anglo-Nepalese War in 1814-16\u00a0AD. The immediate family of Bhimsen and Senior Kaji Amar Singh took over all the military commands in that war. Another unrelated warrior Bhakti Thapa also led the war at Deuthal aged 71 and died too. Thapas were out of power after the rise of Rana dynasty who were blood relatives of Thapas. Later Panchayat government of Nepal that began in 1961\u00a0AD saw large number of Thapas in the cabinet.\nKhas Kshatri Thapa.\nKhas Thapa or Chhetri/Kshatri Thapa are Khas people of Indo-Aryan group. They are categorized into Kshatriya in Hinduism. They follow Hinduism and are divided by Khas clans and Hindu Gotra system. The clan names of Khas Kshatri Thapas are: \"Bagale Thapa\", \"Punwar Thapa\", \"Godar Thapa\", \"Lamichhane Thapa\", \"Suyal Thapa\", \"Kalikote Thapa\", \"Hrikshen Thapa\", \"Khulal Thapa\", \"Deoja Thapa\", \"Thakuryal Thapa\", \"Gamle Thapa\", \"Sonal Thapa\", and many others.\nBagale Thapa.\nBagale Thapa is the most prominent clan within Khas Thapa.

{"id": "591452", "revid": "1127502", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=591452", "title": "Kshetri", "text": "Khas/Kshetri or Khas/Chhetri () are Turanid Ab-Original Native From of people belonging to Turkic-Mongol Mixed caste in Khas group, a Altaic ethno-linguistic group. Generally, the Parvate/Pahari (hilly) Kshatriyas are called as Kshetris or Khas Kshetris. Many historians called Kshetris as Decendents Of Magars. Kshetris served as rulers, administrators, governors and warriors as per their Occupational caste. They were able to dominate most of the Nepalese history through monopolizing government and military upto 1951 AD. After democracy in Nepal, Kshetris were still visible in the government especially dominating Panchayati government and still monopolizing military.\nAccording to 1854 \"Muluki Ain\" (Legal Code) of Nepal, Kshetris belong to \"sacred thread bearers\" (Yagyopavit) and \"twice born\" (Dvija) Hindus.\nEtymology.\nChhetri is Nepalese local colloquial term for Kshatriya. Kshetri () is considered a derivative form of the Sanskrit word Kshatriya. Hill-Kshetri, Kshetri, Chhetri, Pahadi Chhetri and Khas Kshetri are all used to denote this caste.\nHistory.\nThey are descended from old warriors of Khas Kingdom. Chhetri dominated the military forces of Shah dynasty of Nepal. The 5 main Chhetri families at Royal court of Nepal formed group called Kaji Khalak (Aristocrats). They are; Basnyat, Pande, Thapa, Kunwar and Bista. Basnyat, Pande and Thapas were most powerful Chhetri groups led by Shivaram Singh Basnyat, Kalu Pande and Birbhadra Thapa at the Unification of Nepal. The Kunwars were led by Ramkrishna Kunwar and Bista/Bisht were led by Gajabal Bista and Atibal Bista. Sometimes, Bhandari Kshetri family of Jaswanta Bhandari was also considered as Kaji Khalak family of the Royal court of Nepal.\nIn the court struggle for power, Pande Khalaks and Thapa Khalaks were fierce opponents. They often opposed each other. Pandes were supported by Basnyats due to blood relations. Thapas were supported by Kunwars due to blood relations. In the end, Kunwars betrayed Thapa groups by murdering the Thapa leader Mathabar Singh Thapa. That caused Kunwars to rise to power and all Kshetris were thrown of power. The Kunwar high rank officers escalated quickly between 1841 AD to 1854 AD.Kunwars claimed royalty and changed their surname to \"Rana\" (meaning: King) from \"Kunwar\" (meaning: Prince). In 1951AD, democracy was established and Kshetri rule were stopped.\nDemography.\nAccording to 2011 Nepal census, Kshetri stands as the most populous group in Nepal with 16.6% of Nepal's population (or 43,98,053 peoples).\nKshetris are the second largest Hindu group with Hindu population of 43,65,113 (99.3% of Kshetris) as per the 2011 Nepal census. Kshetris are largest group in 20 districts in Nepal. Kathmandu consists largest Kshetri population. \nKshetris has second highest civil service representation with 19.59% of Nepal's bureaucracy after Bahuns while having 16% of Nepal's total population. The civil service representation to population ratio is 1.18 times for Kshetri. Kshetri dominate the military forces with nearly all high ranked officers belonging to either Kshetri or Thakuri caste. Nearly, only one Chief of Army Staff (Chhatraman Singh Gurung) belonged to Non-Chhetri/Thakuri caste. Thus, the highest military rank (Chief of Army Staff previously Commander-in-Chief) is completely monopolized by Chhetri caste.they also recruit in british army in large numbers, chhetri/thakuris dominant 40% of total nepal army strength , and they have reserved regiment the 9 gorkha rifles in indian army.\nCulture.\nReligion.\nKshetri are almost all Hindus as per 2011 Nepal census. Historically, they practiced Hindu polytheism and shamanism. They generally worship their clan deity (Kul Devta), friendly deity (Ishta Devta) and Khas Masto deities. Kshetri commonly have warrior like deities as Bhadrakali, Kalika Bhawani and different forms of Goddess Kali as female deity and Rudra, Veerbhadra (ferocious forms of Shiva) as male deity. Bhadrakali, a popular form of Goddess Kali, is the main deity of the Nepalese Army (previously Gorkhali Army) due to prevalence of Kshetri commanders. Worship to these deities were necessary before wars. There was a popular folk legend that the Chinese failed the strategic attacks on 1792 AD due to the effect of religious war cry of \"Jai Bhawani\". In the times of unification of Nepal, Kshetris were more rigid to worship of ferocious forms of Godess Kali and Lord Shiva. Amar Singh Thapa based on religious values developed Nishankalika flag after ceremoniously inviting Kalika Bhawani, ancestors, friendly deities and 49 Maruts to reside on the flag. \nMany Kshetris triennially celebrate clanwise Masto deity worship called \"Dewali Puja\". Dewali Puja is common among Bahuns too. In the Dewali Puja, Kshetris of the same clan give male goat sacrifices at a particular place. It is a form of millennium old ancient worship continued till date. Kshetris celebrate many Hindu festivals like Dashain (Dussehra), Tihar (Deepawali), Maghe Sankranti, Janai Purnima, Holi, etc. Dashain and Tihar are primary festivals of Pahadi Hindu castes. Most Kshetri families give goat sacrifices on either Maha Ashtami day or Maha Nawami day of Dashain festival. Few Kshetri clans give male buffalo sacrifices on Maha Ashtami day.\nMarriages.\nRajputs and Thakuris are sometimes considered as subcaste of Kshetri while they have distinct cultural difference with mainstream Kshetris. Kshetri is an endogamous unit. They donot practice maternal cousin marriages as Thakuri caste which is the basis of cultural distinction. Kshetri has hundreds of clans. They are categorized by family deity and single gotra. They do not marry with the members of their whole maternal clan and members of their parents' maternal families as per popular quote \nThe maternal clan marriage prohibition also include non marriage prohibition with the Bahun counterpart of that clan. For example; Those having maternal clan as Khilchine Adhikari Chhetri cannot marry in the clan of Khilchine Adhikari Bahun as there is brotherhood between these clans. They never marry in their paternal clan and those having same gotra. \"Jaari\" marriage i.e. marrying others' wife, is not allowed. Also \"Gandharva\" and \"Rakshas\" marriages are not allowed.\nDiet.\nDieting rules for Kshetri were decided by Kshetri \"Birandala\" (brotherhood). Kshetri do not consume pork like Rajputs which is a basis of cultural difference. Kshetri are not allowed to eat beef, buffalo, pig, felines and all wild forms of them as per Hindu rituals for Kshatriya. Goats, sheep and all variations and forms of them, are fully allowed. Chicken, duck and goose are debatable and allowance is regionally dependent.\nEthics.\nHistorically, Kshetri has been part of the some of the powerful Pahari empires as Khas Empire and Gorkha Empire.

During a courtship, a couple gets to know one another. They later decide if they will get engaged, married or other such agreement. A courtship may be a private and informal matter between two people. On the other hand, it may be public. Or it could be a formal arrangement with the approval of a family.\nThere is a great difference between couples. The average extent of a courtship differs quite a bit across the world. Courtship may be entirely omitted, as in some cases of arranged marriage.\nIn the United Kingdom, there was a poll of over 3,000 engaged or married couples. The average time between first meeting and an accepted marriage proposal was two years and eleven months. The women felt ready to accept at an average of two years and seven months.\nIn the earlier 1800s, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding a marriage partner, not social reasons. In the more traditional forms of Christianity, this concept of courtship has been kept.\nIn recent research, it has been found that marriage rates have dropped with people. There are not so many courted relationships in the society of today. This means that fewer people are getting married and practicing premarital sex. Many families are started with children, and \"then\" marriage. Traditions are referred to as a thing of the past. However, there are many people who still follow the old-fashioned courting route for their relationships."}

There are six countries considered to be Turkic states: Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The last 4 countries are commonly known as \"the Stans\". All of them except Turkey used to be part of the Soviet Union until its fall in 1991. While most of the people of all these countries are Muslim, none of these countries use the Arabic alphabet to read and write their own language. Either they use the Latin alphabet, like Turkey, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, or they use the Cyrillic alphabet, like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. While the people of Xinjiang, the Uighurs, are part of the Turkic peoples, it is not officially considered part of the Turkic states because it is controlled by China. While Northern Cyprus, which is most made of Turkish people, calls itself its own country, Turkey is the only other country that recognizes its statehood, or its being a state."}

At that time it was called Biblioteca y Museo Municipales (Municipal Library and Museum). Its collection was shown in a room of the Santander City Council building. In those early days the collection included paintings and sculptures and many other kinds objects. It had objects from archaeological sites and also objects related to natural history and ethnology.\nIn 1923 the city built a new home for the library and museum. The building was designed by Leonardo Rucabado. Starting in 1941, the library moved out of the building. The museum took over the whole building and began to change its collections. It kept the paintings and sculptures but gave the archaeological, natural history, and ethnology objects to other museums in Santander and the Cantabria region. The museum re-opened on 3 November 1947 with a new name: Museo Municipal de Pinturas (Municipal Museum of Painting). In 1957 the museum changed its name again. It became the Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Santander (Municipal Museum of Fine Arts of Santander).\nBetween 1978 and 1993 the museum's collection of works by younger artists and especially artists from Cantabria grew bigger. The inside of the museum was also repaired and made more modern. The museum specialized more and more in modern and contemporary art. In 2011 the museum changed its name to Museum de Arte Moderno y Contempor\u00e1neo de Santander y Cantabria (Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Santander and Cantabria). That is the name it has today.\nCollections.\nThe museum has 1,870 works of art\u2014paintings, sculptures, photographs, engravings, and installations. About 100 of these works are by Spanish, Flemish, and Italian artists from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. All the rest are from the last part of the 19th century to the 21st century.

The anger during withdrawal can range from a steady, mild stream of rage to a sudden and volatile outburst. These can stem from feelings of anxiety and a general lack of emotional control during the first few days of withdrawing, which results in swaying back and forth between anger and euphoria. However, these unbalanced emotions often regulate themselves naturally within three months.\nInsomnia: One of the most commonly reported symptoms associated with marijuana withdrawal is insomnia.

Its peak rises above sea level. It has erupted many times since the Spanish conquest. Its first historical eruption was recorded on December 7, 1580. A 1993 eruption killed nine people, including six scientists who had gone down into the volcano's crater to take samples of gases and measure gravity in an attempt to be able to predict future eruptions. It is currently the most active volcano in Colombia.\nGeological history.\nGaleras has been an active volcano for at least a million years. Its dominant product is andesite, an igneous rock . Two major caldera-forming eruptions have occurred: the first was about 560,000 years ago in an eruption which expelled about of material. The second was some time between 40,000 and 150,000 years ago, in a smaller but still sizable eruption of of material. Since that second eruption, part of the caldera wall has collapsed, possibly due to instabilities caused by hydrothermal (high-temperature water) activity, and later eruptions have built up a smaller cone inside the now horseshoe-shaped caldera.\nIn light of its violent eruptive history and proximity to the 450,000\u00a0people of Pasto, Galeras was designated a \"Decade Volcano\" in 1991. This identified it as a target for detailed study as part of the United Nations' \"International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction\".\nEruptive history.\nGaleras is considered the most active volcano in Colombia, followed by Nevado del Ruiz. Its earliest activity during the Holocene has been dated at 7050 BC \u00b1 1000 years through radiocarbon dating. Other eruptions similar to this event include those in 3150\u00a0BC \u00b1 200 years, 2580\u00a0BC \u00b1 500 years, 1160\u00a0BC \u00b1 300 years, 490\u00a0BC \u00b1 100 years, and in 890 AD \u00b1 200 years. Typically these eruptions consist of a central vent explosion, conducive to an explosive eruption causing pyroclastic flows and/or lahars. Eruptions in more recent times, which have been recorded consist of those in 1535, December 1580, July 1616, 1641, 1670, 1754, November 1796, June 1823, October 1828, 1834, October 1865, July 1889, 1891, December 1923, October 1924, October 1932, February 1936, July 1947, January 1950, 1974, February 1989, January 1990, January 1993, March 2000, June 2002, July 2004, November 2005, and October 2007. Reported incidents with no official proof occurred in 1836, 1930, 1933, and 1973.\n1993 eruption.\nGaleras became active again in 1988 after 10 years of dormancy.\nA Decade Volcano conference in the city of Pasto, in 1993, ended in disaster when several of the scientists present mounted an impromptu (unscheduled) expedition on 14 January to the crater of Galeras. An eruption occurred unexpectedly while they were at the summit (highest point), resulting in the deaths of six scientists and three tourists.\nElements in the media made the event controversial. They suggested that the expedition leader, geologist Stanley Williams, who survived along with four others, had ignored safety procedures. A prediction had been made three days before the eruption, based on B-Type activity seen on a seismograph. Seismic B-types had been used successfully to predict eruptions on other volcanoes. However, the prediction was based simply on the one seismographic printout viewed in the light of previous history of Galeras, without any additional scientific measurements showing any serious activity within the volcano.\n21st-century activity.\nActivity at a low level has continued at Galeras. Small explosions occasionally cause ash to fall on nearby villages and towns. The volcano has continued to be well-studied, and predictions of eruptions at the volcano have improved. One phenomenon, which seems to be a reliable precursor to eruptive activity, is a low-frequency seismic event known as a \"tornillo event\". These have occurred before about eighty percent (80%) of the explosions at Galeras, and the number of tornillo events recorded before an eruption is also correlated with the size of the eruption that followed.\nMore than 100\u00a0minor tremors were felt during a major eruption in April 2002, although no damage or injury was reported. An eruption in November 2005 forced an evacuation of the dangerous area surrounding the volcano, and about 9,400\u00a0people from nearby villages (most of them farmers) were ordered to leave. The city of Pasto, about from the volcano, was blanketed by a layer of ash after the volcanic explosion, forcing the residents to put on goggles and face masks.\nNumerous minor tremors and ash emissions since March 2006 culminated on 12 July 2006 in three explosive eruptions, producing an ash and gas column reaching an altitude of . Rock falls and pyroclastic flows were reported from towns as distant as Consac\u00e1, west of the main crater. The Colombian government has repeatedly ordered evacuations to temporary shelters, of more than 8500\u00a0people residing in the highest risk areas surrounding the volcano, with hopes of eventual assistance toward permanent relocation.\nOn January 17, 2008, the volcano erupted around 20:06 (local) (01:06 UTC). There were no immediate reports of injuries or serious property damage. Later the experts confirmed partial damage in the national and local TV towers.\nThen, on February 14, 2009, the volcano erupted around 19:10 (local) (00:10 UTC). Some 8,000 residents were evacuated, and there were no immediate reports of injuries or serious property damage. As in 2005, the city of Pasto was blanketed by a layer of ash after the volcanic explosion (due to the direction of the wind). The local authorities ordered two water treatment plants near Galeras to shut down.\nOn March 13, 2009, Galeras erupted twice: at around 15:55 and 17:00 (local time). Ash fell on Pasto and some other towns near the volcano. The city and towns' evacuation was ordered, but reportedly ignored. No injuries or damage were reported.\n2010 eruption.\nThe volcano erupted on January 3, 2010, forcing the evacuation of 8,000 people. This was the tenth such eruption of the volcano in the previous year, and the first of 2010. Colombian authorities also stated that it could remain volatile in the weeks to come.\nGaleras erupted again on August 25, 2010, with an ash plume visible in the air. The eruption, which was described as non-explosive, caused authorities to raise an alert for neighbouring towns.\nThis volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project."}

However, the Japanese thought the name the Chinese gave them was insulting, so the Japanese changed the Chinese exonym to \u548c, which has the same pronunciation as \u502d in Japanese but means \"harmony\", and the Japanese chose to call their own country \u65e5\u672c, which is pronounced \"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\" in Japanese and it means \"origin of the sun\"."}

The movie stars Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, Aneurin Barnard, James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy.\nPlot.\nIn 1940, during the Battle of France, Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk. Tommy, a young British private, is the sole survivor of a German ambush. At the beach, he finds thousands of troops awaiting evacuation and meets Gibson, who is burying a body. After a Luftwaffe dive-bomber attack, they find a wounded man. They rush his stretcher onto a hospital ship, hoping to get aboard, but are ordered off. The ship is sunk by dive bombers; Tommy meets Alex. They leave at night on a destroyer, but it is torpedoed by a U-boat. Gibson saves Tommy and Alex from the sinking ship, and they get back to the beach.\nWith only a single, vulnerable mole available for embarking on deep-draft ships, the Royal Navy requisitions civilian vessels in Great Britain that can get to the beach. In Weymouth, a civilian sailor Dawson, with his son Peter, sets out on his boat \"Moonstone\", rather than let the Navy commandeer her. Impulsively, their teenage hand George joins them, hoping to do something noteworthy. At sea, they rescue a shivering shell-shocked soldier from a wrecked ship. When he realises that Dawson is sailing for Dunkirk, the soldier demands that they turn back and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the scuffle, George suffers a head injury that renders him blind. Elsewhere, three RAF Spitfires cross the English Channel, heading towards Dunkirk, tasked with defending the evacuation. After their leader is shot down in a dogfight, one of the pilots, Farrier, assumes command, but the other Spitfire is hit and ditches. Its pilot, Collins, is rescued by \"Moonstone\".\nTommy, Alex and Gibson join some soldiers of a Highlanders regiment and hide inside a beached trawler in the intertidal zone outside the Allied perimeter, waiting for the rising tide to refloat it. German troops shoot at the boat, and water enters through the bullet holes. Alex, hoping to lighten the boat, accuses Gibson, who has stayed silent, of being a German spy. Gibson reveals he is French; he stole the identity of the dead British soldier he buried, hoping to be evacuated with the British. The group abandons the boat when it begins to sink, but Gibson is entangled in a chain and drowns. When a nearby minesweeper is sunk by a bomber, \"Moonstone\" manoeuvres to take on those in the water, including Tommy and Alex. Peter discovers that George is dead. Asked by the shell-shocked soldier, he lies and says that George is fine. Farrier reaches Dunkirk, before his fuel runs out. Gliding over the beach, he shoots down a dive-bomber, saving ships and troops, and then lands beyond the perimeter. He sets fire to his plane before being taken prisoner by the Germans. In all, 300,000 men are evacuated. Royal Navy Commander Bolton stays to oversee the evacuation of the French. Arriving back in Weymouth, Dawson is congratulated for having saved so many men. The shell-shocked soldier sees George's body being carried away. Peter goes to the local newspaper; a front-page article commends George as a hero. Tommy and Alex board a train, and receive a hero's welcome when the train arrives in Woking.\nBackground.\nSet during the Second World War, it portrays the Dunkirk evacuation. It is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, the movie is an international co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States, France and the Netherlands. Winston Churchill\nNolan wrote the script, told from three perspectives\u2014the land, sea, and air\u2014to contain little dialogue. Filming began in May 2016 in Dunkirk, France, and ended in Los Angeles, United States, where it also began post-production. Will Attenborough played Second Lieutenant. His grandfather, actor-director Richard Attenborough, appeared in \"Dunkirk\" (1958).\nCinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65 mm and 65\u00a0mm large format movie stock. The movie made extensive use of practical effects, such as employing thousands of extras, gathering boats that had participated in the real Dunkirk evacuation, and using genuine era-appropriate planes for aerial sequences.\nRelease.\n\"Dunkirk\" premiered on 13 July 2017 at Odeon Leicester Square in London, England, and was released in the United Kingdom and United States on 21 July 2017 in IMAX, 70\u00a0mm and 35 mm film.

There is no treatment, and it causes death in infancy. \nBackground.\nHis parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, brought him to the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in October 2016 because he was having trouble breathing, and he was put on mechanical ventilation. \nHis condition continued to deteriorate, and the genetic condition was diagnosed in November. The doctors and parents initially agreed to attempt an experimental treatment, but after the child had seizures that caused more brain damage in January, the doctors withdrew their support for trying the treatment because it was futile and would only prolong whatever pain the infant was suffering. \nThe doctors thought it would be best for the child to remove life support and allow him to die, but the parents still wanted to try the treatment.\nCourt cases.\nThis disagreement led to a series of court cases. The courts consistently supported GOSH's position, and the parents eventually dropped their challenge and agreed to withdraw life support. There was one more court case, about how to allow the child to die, which was decided on 27 July. On that day he was transferred to a hospice, and on the next day mechanical ventilation was withdrawn and he died at the age of 11 months and 24 days, a week before his first birthday.\nDeath.\nA week after being placed in hospice care in London on 28 July 2017 at 11 months."}

Montreux lies on the northeast shore of Lake Geneva at the fork in the Roman road from Italy over the Simplon Pass, where the roads to the Roman capital of Aventicum and the road into Gaul through Besan\u00e7on separated. This made it an important settlement already in Roman times.\nIn the 12th century, viticulture was introduced to the region, and the sunny slopes of the lake from Lavaux to Montreux became an important wine-growing region.\nThe region was subject to various princes, most notably the princes of Savoy from the south side of the lake. They unified the territory which comprises the present canton of Vaud and were generally popular sovereigns.\nAfter the Burgundian Wars in the 15th century, the Swiss in Berne occupied the region without resistance, an indication of the weakness of the princes of Savoy. The Reformation made the region around Montreux and Vevey an attractive haven for Huguenots from Italy, who brought their artisanal skills and set up workshops and businesses.\nIn 1798, Napoleon liberated the region from the Bernese. In the 19th century, the tourist industry became a major commercial outlet, with the grand hotels of Montreux attracting the rich and cultured from Europe and America.\nStarting in the 19th century there were three independent municipalities that shared a central authority. This county council was made up of four deputies from Le Ch\u00e2telard, two from Les Planches and one from Veytaux. The church, the market hall of La Rouvenaz, the secondary school (the building was from 1872 and 1897) and the slaughter-house (1912) were all owned by the county council. Each municipality had its own taxes and a mayor. In 1962, the municipalities of Le Ch\u00e2telard and Les Planches merged, while Veytaux remained independent.\nVillages.\nBaugy, Brent, Caux, Chailly-sur-Montreux, Chamby, Chaulin, Ch\u00eane, Chernex, Clarens, Collonge, Cornaux, Crin, Fontanivent, Glion, Jor, Le Ch\u00e2telard, Les Avants, Les Planches, Mont-Fleuri, Pallens, Pertit, Planchamp, Sonzier, Tavel, Territet, Vernex, Villard-sur-Chamby and Vuarennes.\nClimate.\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification subtype for Montreux's climate is \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).\nTwin towns.\nMontreux is twinned with the towns of Menton, France and Wiesbaden, Germany, and with the city of Chiba in Japan."}

His presidency ended on January 20, 2021, when Biden was sworn in as the 46th president.\nBackground.\nTrump started spending money on the 2020 race on November 24, 2016 (only sixteen days after the end of the 2016 election). On January 10, 2017, \"Politico\" reported that Trump would be keeping his campaign offices in Trump Tower open in order to lay the groundwork for a re-election campaign. On January 18, Trump revealed in an interview with \"The Washington Post\" that he had decided on \"Keep America Great\" as his 2020 campaign slogan.\nTrump launched his reelection campaign significantly earlier in his presidency than his predecessors did. Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan all declared their candidacies for reelection in the third year of their presidencies.\nHad Trump been reelected, it would have been the first time in American history that there have been four consecutive presidents who were elected to two terms.\nRallies.\nThe first rally paid for by the campaign was held on February 18, 2017, in Melbourne, Florida, and was attended by an estimated 9,000 supporters.\nThe campaign's second rally was held a month later in Nashville, Tennessee on March 15, and it was the 250th birthday of Andrew Jackson. Before the rally, Trump paid tribute to Jackson and laid a wreath at his tomb. A third rally was held by the campaign in Louisville on March 20, days after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\nTrump held his fourth campaign rally with Vice President Mike Pence on April 29 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on the 100th day of Trump's presidency.\nIn June, Trump began campaigning in Iowa. Iowa is considered to be a perennial swing state. Trump held his sixth campaign rally on July 25 at the Covelli Centre in Youngstown, Ohio.\nTrump held his seventh campaign rally at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena in Huntington, West Virginia on August 3.\nTrump held his eighth campaign rally on August 22 at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona.\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Donald Trump held a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The rally was notable for a surprisingly low turnout. However, the rally managed to reach 6.7 million views online. Fox News stated that the rally was its highest Saturday primetime viewership in the network's history\nElection Day.\nOn November 4, Trump claimed to have won the election. However, no clear winner was determined, because final results from states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia were still unknown. Trump was leading in the vote count of those states at the time, however there were many still-uncounted votes, mainly from mail-in ballots which were not yet counted.\nTrump attempted to use the courts to stop the vote-counting. His campaign filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan. However, these lawsuits were all rejected.\nOn November 7, news organizations ABC News, Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, Reuters, and \"the New York Times\" said that Trump had lost the election to Biden.\nTrump refused to concede upon hearing the news. The administrator of the GSA, Emily W. Murphy, did not cooperate with president-elect Biden until November 23. Many Republicans in the Senate claimed that the election was still unsettled, and Attorney General William Barr allowed the Justice Department to investigate alleged \"massive voter fraud.\"\nIn an interview with the Associated Press published December 1, Attorney General William Barr acknowledged: \"To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.\" By January, Trump had lost 60 lawsuits.\nOn January 2, 2021, during an hour-long conference call, Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the state's vote totals by the 11,780 votes he needed to win the state. During the call, Trump falsely suggested that Raffensperger could have committed a criminal offense. On January 11, the phone call was cited in a new article of impeachment introduced in the House of Representatives.\nSelf-declared \"alternate electors\" voted in protest; these votes had no legal validity. Well over a hundred Republican representatives promised to contest the counting ceremony at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. Experts debated whether Trump was trying to perform a self-coup.\nOn January 6, 2021, Trump spoke at a \"March to Save America\" rally on the Ellipse. There, he encouraged the crowd to \"fight like hell\" and said he'd be marching with them to the United States Capitol, although he did not join them. The crowd arrived at the Capitol building and broke in. At the same time, the electoral colleges votes were being counted, and those in the House and Senate had to be evacuated. Five people died from the events, while dozens more were injured, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened over 170 investigations into the events.\nPolling.\nThroughout the campaign, many polls almost always showed Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead of Trump. Trump's campaign rejected these polls, claiming how they incorrectly predicted a Hillary Clinton victory in the 2016 presidential election. Many people had also come to distrust polls; a study from the Pew Research Center showing that even when Biden led Trump by a wide margin, many people still believed that Trump would win the election.\nTrump's polling worsened throughout June and July, mainly in battleground states and states that mainly vote Republican. A mid-July \"Washington Post\"/ABC News poll showed Biden's double-digit lead holding.\nIn August, Trump's polling slightly improved. One national poll conducted then showing Biden leading by just three percent nationally. Trump also began to improve in state polls; one CNN poll at the time showed Biden up by just one percentage point in 15 battleground states. Towards the end of the month however, Biden's lead started to grow again.\nAfter the 2020 Republican National Convention, Trump's polling improved. By the end of August, Trump had a lead against Biden in key states such as Ohio where he led 50% to 45%, and was polling neck-and-neck with his opponent in other important states such as Florida.\nTrump's national polling numbers fell heavily again following his performance at the first presidential debate and his COVID-19 diagnosis at the end of September and beginning of October, as Biden's lead went over 10 points. A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken around this period showed Biden's lead to be 53% to 43%.\nTrump overestimated his polls on Election Day but lost re-election. Although polling accurately predicted the winner of 48 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, Biden\u2019s margin of victory in many states was much smaller than expected."}

She has been the member of Parliament (MP) for Mount Albert since March 2017.\nArdern was born in Hamilton and grew up in Morrinsville and Murupara. After graduating from the University of Waikato in 2001, Ardern began her career working as a researcher for Prime Minister Helen Clark. She later worked in London in the Cabinet Office, and was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth. Ardern was first elected as an MP in the 2008 general election, when Labour lost control after nine years. She was later elected to represent the Mount Albert electorate in a by-election in February 2017.\nArdern was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party on 1 March 2017, after the resignation of Annette King. Just five months later, after Labour's leader Andrew Little resignation, Ardern was elected as party leader. She led her party to win 14 seats at the 2017 general election on 23 September, winning 46 seats to the National Party's 56. After working with New Zealand First, a minority coalition government with Labour and New Zealand First was formed, supported by the Green Party. Ardern became Prime Minister and she was sworn in by the governor-general on 26 October 2017. She became the world's youngest female head of government at age 37. Ardern later became the world's second elected head of government to give birth while in office when her daughter was born in June 2018.\nArdern calls herself a social democrat and a progressive. Her government has focused on the New Zealand housing crisis, child poverty, and social inequality. In March 2019, she became popular because of her leadership during the Christchurch mosque shootings and for introducing strict gun laws in response. For much of 2020, she also became popular for the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ardern led the Labour Party to a historic victory in the 2020 general election, winning a majority of 65 seats in Parliament.\nEarly life.\nArdern was born in Hamilton, New Zealand, and grew up as a Mormon.

She studied at Morrinsville College, where she was the student representative on the school's board. She later went to the University of Waikato, graduating in 2001 with a Bachelor of Communication Studies (BCS) in politics and public relations.\nArdern became interested in politics because her aunt asked her to help her with campaigning for New Plymouth MP Harry Duynhoven during his re-election campaign at the 1999 general election.\nArdern joined the Labour Party at the age of 17 and became a senior figure in the Young Labour party of the party.

Ardern lost the election, but entered Parliament as a list MP because of her high ranking in the party list. She became the youngest sitting MP in Parliament.\nOpposition Leader Phil Goff promoted Ardern to the front bench, naming her Labour's spokesperson for Youth Affairs and for Justice (Youth Affairs). She made appearances on TVNZ's \"Breakfast\" programme as part of the \"Young Guns\" feature, alongside National MP and future National Party leader, Simon Bridges.\nArdern ran for the parliament seat of Auckland Central for Labour in the 2011 general election, running against incumbent National MP Nikki Kaye for National and Greens candidate Denise Roche. She lost to Kaye by 717 votes. However, she returned to Parliament because of her party list ranking, on which she was ranked 13th.\nAfter Goff resigned from the Party leadership, Ardern supported David Shearer for party leader. She was promoted to the fourth-ranking position in his Shadow Cabinet on 19 December 2011, becoming a spokesperson for social development under the new leader. Ardern ran again in Auckland Central at the 2014 general election. She again finished second, but increased her own vote and lowered Kaye's majority from 717 to 600. She was soon ranked 5th on Labour's list and because of this, Ardern still returned to Parliament where she became Shadow spokesperson for Justice, Children, Small Business, and Arts &amp; Culture under new leader Andrew Little.\n2017 Mount Albert by-election.\nArdern later ran for the Labour nomination for the Mount Albert by-election to be held in February 2017.

Ardern's vacant list seat was taken by Raymond Huo. However, Ardern would remain as Deputy Leader for exactly five months because she was elected Leader of the Labour Party in August.\nLeader of the Opposition, 2017.\nOn 1 August 2017, just seven weeks before the 2017 general election, Ardern became Leader of the Labour Party and also Opposition Leader, after the resignation of Andrew Little. Ardern was confirmed in an election to choose a new leader at a meeting the same day. At 37, Ardern became the youngest leader of the Labour Party in its history.

She is a Saiyan of Universe 6 in the Universal Survival Arc.\nAppearance and Personality.\nCaulifla is a short girl of slender build and fair complexion. She wears a low cut magenta tube top, low-set purple harem trousers, long dark grey wristbands, and a pair of pointy dark grey shoes. Her hair is long, wild, and spiky. Caulifla's eyes are narrow yet big, with large black pupils, as well as thin eyebrows.\nAs noted by her brother, she has a very punkish attitude and is also recognized as a tomboy, to which she shows a strong contrast to the rest of her race, acting more akin to the Universe 7 Saiyans. Caulifla is shown to be very lazy if not self-absorbed as she initially refused to join the Tournament of Power even when learning her universe's or her own existence were on the line. It took Cabba telling her about the Super Saiyan form as well as about being able to achieve greater heights in her strength to make her agree, showing her desire to become stronger. Despite her tomboyish attitude, Caulifla cares about others, especially her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Kale, whom she treats like a younger sister.\nCharacter role.\nCaulifla is first seen sitting on a large throne-like chair eating a large bone of meat. After being informed by Renso, Cabba attempts to recruit her to the Universe 6 team, but Caulifla shows no interest, regardless of what may happen to Universe 6. After Cabba transforms, Caulifla accepts his invitation to the team, knowing she has the ability to not only transform into Super Saiyan, but also get stronger. Later Caulifla is seen in a rocky area with Cabba and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Kale, Cabba teaches Caulifla how to become a Super Saiyan. Cabba then explains to her to focus her energy on her back. Caulifla tries this and she easily transform into to a Super Saiyan. Caulifla also transform into to a Super Saiyan 2 like when she easily deflect an energy blast from a berserk Kale. In the Tournament of Power Caulifla and her Prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Kale both fought Goku in a fight. Caulifla was in her Super Saiyan 2 form while Kale was in her berserk form.

A good latch helps the baby get milk. This happens when the bottom of the areola (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth. When the nipple is far back inside the baby's mouth this is a good latch. A latch that is not good happens when the baby does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth. A shallow or short latch causes the nipple skin to press against the hard bones in the top of the baby's mouth. That will cause cracked nipples on the mother. Cracked nipples are painful and can bleed.\nPositioning.\nA comfortable position helps the baby to latch well. It may take some time for a baby and mother to learn how to get a good latch.\nGetting a good latch for breasting can be learned. Mothers can:\nPain.\nPain means that there is a poor latch. If the pain lasts longer than a few seconds, the latch is probably not correct. The tway for getting a good latch is to gently break the suction by placing a clean finger into the baby's baby's mouth and help the baby latch on again. When the baby unlatches, the nipple should the same or slightly longer. Pain or pinching is a sign of a poor latch. When the baby latches it can feel like a pinch that goes away. If it's more painful than that, it's probably a bad latch. And if the latch hurts the mom, it also keeps the baby from getting enough milk.\nTongue-tied.\nSometimes, a baby's tongue is stuck to the bottom of the mouth. This attachment means the baby can't open his or her mouth wide enough to get a good latch. This is called a tongue-tie. When a baby is checked after it is born, this usually is not checked. If the baby isn't latching on well and is not gaining weight mothers should talk to the nurse or doctor about this. Tongue-tie can be treated and breastfeeding gets better.\nInfants will naturally move their head while looking and feeling for a breast to feed. There are many ways to start feeding the infant, and the best approach is the one that works for the mother and the infant. The steps below can help with getting the infant to \"latch\" on to the breast for feeding.2\nHold the infant against a bare chest. Dress the infant in only a diaper to ensure skin-to-skin contact.\nKeep the infant upright, with his or her head directly under the chin.\nSupport the infant's neck and shoulders with one hand and his or her hips with the other hand. The infant may try to move around to find the breast.\nThe infant's head should be slightly tilted back to make nursing and swallowing easier. When his or her head is tilted back and the mouth is open, the tongue will naturally be down in the mouth to allow the breast to go on top of it.\nAt first, allow the breast to hang naturally. The infant may open his or her mouth when the nipple is near his or her mouth. The mother also can gently guide the infant to latch on to the nipple.\nWhile the infant is feeding, his or her nostrils may flare to breathe in air. Do not panic\u2014this flaring is normal. The infant can breathe normally while breastfeeding.\nAs the infant tilts backward, support his or her upper back and shoulders with the palm of the hand and gently pull the infant close.\nSigns of a good latch.\nA good latch is important for both effective breastfeeding and comfort. Review the following signs to determine whether the infant has a good latch:\nPoor latching.\nNot only is a poor latch painful but it can also lead to blocked milk ducts, mastitis, and other infections. A poor latch also isn't good for the baby, as it means he or she isn't getting enough milk. So if poor latching has been occuring for more than a few days breastfeeding mothers can get help. There are resources available at no or low cost."}

{"id": "593603", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593603", "title": "Cracked nipples", "text": "Cracked nipples can happen when a mother breastfeeds her infant and it can be very painful. This happens for many reasons. The nipples can hurt, dry, or bleed. When the baby is breastfeeding, the cracked nipple can cause great pain. Many times this severe pain will make the mother stop breastfeeding. The crack looks like a cut across the tip of the nipple. Cracked nipples can be treated and healed.\nDescription.\nThe nipple helps nourish the baby. Small openings around the nipple are part of a gland that makes oil to keep the skin soft. Cracked nipples usually happen to breastfeeding mothers. Sometimes a sore will form. Cracked nipples are a skin condition that is caused by damage to the nipple. Sometimes cracked nipples can be seen three to seven days after the baby is born. If a nipple appears to be in the shape of a wedge or it looks white and flat this can mean that the nipple may form cracks.\nCause.\nCracked nipples can happen when breasts are too full with milk. New mothers are more likely to get cracked nipples. Cracked nipples can happen if the baby is not in a good position when he or she is breastfeeding. Nipples that are the wrong shape or are pointed can crack. A nipple that is the wrong shape can sometimes get fixed. If a nipple is a light color the baby may have trouble finding it. If a mother uses a breast pump, this will change the shape of the nipple. When a nipple becomes flat, the baby has a hard time getting it into his or her mouth. When the breast gets very full of milk the shape of the breast will change. The breast will be hard, flat and swollen. Then nipples on an full breast are flat.\nWhen the baby well attached, the nipple goes into the soft part of the baby's mouth. This soft part is in the back of the baby's mouth and is called the soft palate. If the nipple goes into the front of the baby's mouth it will be pinched against the hard part of the baby's mouth. This is called the hard palate. When the nipple is in the front part of the baby's mouth, the nipples can crack and cause great pain. The baby can make cracked nipples when she or he sucks very hard. This strong sucking stretches and pulls the nipple. When the nipple rubs inside and against the skin and tongue of the baby's mouth, the nipple can get hurt. An infection can cause cracked nipples. A type of yeast can cause a skin infection on the nipple. This is called a Candida infection. The same infection can be in the baby's mouth. When the yeast infection is in the baby's mouth, it is called thrush. Thrush looks like clumps of milk stuck on the baby's tongue. But thrush cannot be wiped off the baby's tongue. If the thrush is rubbed off, this may hurt the baby. Thrush can happen if the baby has taken antibiotic medicine. \nWhen a mother has her first baby, it may take a few times to get the baby to attach well. A good attachment prevents cracked nipples. If the nipples become cracked or bleed, the latch may need to be corrected. Breastfeeding does not have to stop if a mother has cracked nipples. Breastfeeding will help the nipples heal. A little breast milk or purified lanolin cream or ointment helps the nipples heal. \nIf a baby bottle is used and breastfeeding is done at the same time this may cause cracked nipples. This is because the sucking of a bottle is not the same as the sucking of a nipple. Bottle-feeding babies suck hard on the bottle. Breasfeeding babies use a different way to suck on the breast that is more gentle. Using a bottle makes the baby not want to breastfeed as much.\nInfection.\nInfection can enter the breast through cracked nipples. Bacteria can get in the breast through the cracks. This is called mastitis. Breastmilk protects the baby from infection. Breastmilk does not protect the mother from infection. A breast feeding mother can become infected by a Candida infection (thrush). She can then have deep-pink, cracked, and sore nipples. Mothers with hepatitis B and cracked nipples can breastfeed. There are other infections that the mother can have that can be given to the baby through the cracked nipples. One of this infections that can be given to a baby is called Toxoplasmosis. Transmission risk of HIV can happen if the mother has cracked and bleeding nipples There is a rare infection called Chagas disease, can be given to the breastfeeding infant through cracked nipples. Women with hepatitis C may infect their infants while breastfeeding with cracked nipples.\nTreatment.\nThere are medical people who can help a woman with breastfeeding. They are nurses, midwives and lactation consultants. Healthcare workers treat cracked nipples with 100% lanolin. Sometimes, glycerin nipple pads are made to be cold and put over the nipples to help them heal. If the cause of cracked nipples is from thrush, treatment is usually with nystatin. If the mother is and the baby have a yeast infection then they can be treated at the same time. Breasting helps the nipples heal. \nSome things don't help to cure cracked nipples. These things are using a nipple guard and keeping the breastfeeding short. If the baby only nurses for a short time, then the baby may not get enough milk.\nPrevention.\nThe nipples of mothers are protected by the mother's own skin oil to prevent drying, cracking, or infections. Cracked nipples may be prevented by these things:\nRoman chamomile can be be used directly on to the skin for pain and swelling and is used to treat cracked nipples.\nEpidemiology.\nMany mothers get cracked nipples. Some women in New York City were asked why they stopped breastfeeding. Up to 35% of nursing mothers stopped breastfeeding after one week because of the pain of cracked nipples. Thirty percent stopped breastfeeding after one to three weeks. Mothers in Brazil said that they would also stop breastfeeding when they have cracked nipples. Mothers with higher education levels are more likely to continue breastfeeding even if they have the pain of cracked nipples. Mothers in the UK said they stopped breastfeeding because the cracked nipples made it too painful."}

He served time under his own name and various aliases in Fresno, California; Rusk, Texas; The Dalles, Oregon; Harrison, Idaho; Butte, Montana; Montana State Reform School in Miles City; Montana State Prison (as \"Jeff Davis\" #4194 #3194 and \"Jefferson Rhodes\" #4396); Oregon State Prison (\"Jefferson Baldwin\" #7390); Bridgeport, Connecticut (\"John O'Leary\"); Sing Sing Correctional Facility, New York (\"John O'Leary\" #75182); Clinton Correctional Facility, New York (\"John O'Leary\" #75182); and Washington, D.C (Carl Panzram #33379) and Leavenworth, Kansas (Carl Panzram #31614). While incarcerated, Panzram frequently attacked guards and refused to follow their orders. The guards retaliated, subjecting him to beatings and other punishments.\nEarly life.\nPanzram was born on June 28, 1892, in East Grand Forks, Minnesota the son of Johann Gottlieb Panzram 1843-1926 and Matilda. He had five other siblings who did not become thieves, but Carl was stealing since he was six years old.\nDeath.\nAfter being sentenced to death for killing Warnke,in response to offers from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, Panzram wrote, \"The only thanks you and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck and that I had my hands on it.\"\nOn September 5, 1930, Panzram was hanged for murder at Leavenworth prison. When asked if had any last words, he snapped back \"Hurry it up you Hoosier Bastard. I could kill ten men while you're fooling around!\". He was buried in the prison graveyard marked only by his prison number.\nDuring his last imprisonment a prison guard Henry Lesser gave Panzram a dollar to buy cigarettes; Panzram was so surprised by this one act of kindness that in return he wrote his autobiography\u2014making it quite clear that he did not repent at all of the robberies, murders, arsons, and rapes which he had committed-writing a detailed summary of his crimes and nihilistic philosophy. It began with a straightforward statement:\nIn 1938, Karl Menninger wrote \"Man Against Himself\", including writing about Panzram using the pen name of \"John Smith\", with Panzram Prison Number # 31614. Lesser preserved Panzram's letters and autobiographical manuscript, then spent the next four decades in search of a publisher willing to print the material. Finally, in 1970, it was released under the title '. In 1996, the book formed the basis of a , starring James Woods as Panzram and Robert Sean Leonard as Lesser. In 1980, Lesser donated Panzram's material to San Diego State University, where they are housed, as the \"Carl Panzram papers\", in the Malcolm A. Love Library.

The submarine went on three patrols.\nFirst patrol.\nOn the way from Pearl Harbor to the Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia, she had met with enemy ships. On 13 February 1944 her attack was unsuccessful and no enemy ships were damaged or sunk.\u00a0 She spent 36 of her 57-day mission submerged. When she arrived, Admiral Christie immediately had her commanding officer replaced. The new commanding officer was a son of Admiral Husband Kimmel, who commanded the Pacific Fleet when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and nephew of Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid.\nSecond patrol.\nFor her second patrol, \"Robalo\" went to the South China Sea, with the job of stopping Japanese oil tankers sailing from French Indochina to the fleet anchorage at Tawi Tawi. On 24 April 1944 off Indochina she was bombed by a Japanese antisubmarine aircraft. The \"Robalo\" had been seen by Japanese aircraft carrier Kaiy\u014d which was escorting convoy Hi-58. In trying to escape the submarine dived quickly down to 350 feet (110 m), but the main entry hatch was not closed properly. The periscopes were damaged and flooded, her radar stopped working. A similar failure to close the main hatch had caused the submarine \"Squalus\" to sink with the loss of 26 sailors in 1939. \nOn a \"wildly aggressive patrol\" lasting 51 days, \"Robalo\" fired 20 torpedoes in four attacks: \nWhen she returned to Fremantle, Captain \"Tex\" McLean (commanding Subron 16) and Admiral Christie both considered relieving \"Robalo's\"commanding officer for his own safety.\nThird patrol.\n\"Robalo\" departed Fremantle on 22 June 1944 on her third war patrol. She set a course for the South China Sea to conduct her patrol near the Natuna Islands. After leaving Makassar Strait and Balabac Strait (which was known to be mined), she was meant to arrive about 6 July and remain there until dark on 2 August 1944. On 2 July, a contact report stated \"Robalo\" had sighted a \"Fus\u014d\"-class battleship, with air cover and two destroyers for escort, just east of Borneo. No other messages were ever received from the submarine and when she did not return from patrol, she was presumed lost.\nOn 2 August, a note was dropped from the window of a cell of Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on Palawan Island in the Philippines. It was picked up by an American soldier who was on a work detail nearby. The note was in turn given to H. D. Hough, Yeoman Second Class, who was also a prisoner at the camp. On 4 August, he contacted Trinidad Mendosa, wife of guerrilla leader Dr. Mendosa had more information on the survivors. From these sources, it was concluded \"Robalo\" was sunk on 26 July 1944, off the western coast of Palawan Island. The submarine was sunk by an explosion near her after battery, probably caused by an enemy mine. Only four men swam ashore, and made their way through the jungles northwest of the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp. They were captured by the Japanese Military Police were jailed for guerrilla activities. On 15 August, they were evacuated by a Japanese destroyer and never heard from again. Even though Admiral Christie knew better it was reported for morale reasons that all hands went down with the boat. However, other prisoners on Palawan reported that the boat's skipper Lt. Cdr. Manning Kimmel, son of Admiral Husband Kimmel, was one of the survivors. It is believed that after an air strike on Palawan the Japanese were so angry that they pushed Kimmel and other prisoners into a ditch, poured in gasoline and burned them alive. \n\"Robalo\" was removed from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 September 1944. \"Robalo\" earned two battle stars for World War II service.\nAs noted above, most sources credit \"Robalo\" with sinking a 7,500 tanker but recent research shows the \"Robalo\" with two confirmed victories in the Pacific War Three sinkings are credited to the submarine USS \"Lapon\" (SS-260), but the \"Lapon's\" own history only claims one victory on this date."}

Since then, the Army has built many different kinds of trucks or had private companies build trucks for them.\nOverview.\nArmy trucks are measured by how many tons (907\u00a0kg) each cargo model can carry. The same type of truck can have different bodies. They also measure the number of wheels that are connected to the drive. Off-road trucks have all-wheel drive. Trucks with two axles are called 4x4, trucks with three axles are 6x6, and trucks with four axles are 8x8. Dual tires are counted as one wheel.\nUntil the 1990s, most Army trucks had the engine in front of the cab. In the US this is called \"conventional.\" In Great Britain, this is called \"bonneted.\" In the 1990s, the Army changed to new types. Most new types can have an armored cab. Medium and large trucks have the cab over the engine (\"COE\"). The front of the cab looks flat. Most trucks in Great Britain and Europe are COE. A new large-size truck has the cab in front of the engine (\"forward control\"). There are two axles under the engine. Both axles steer.\nThe Army uses the same parts in many trucks. They also use different parts in the same truck. A truck engine, transmission, and other parts can be from different companies. Different builders can build the same trucks.\nThe Army still uses many old trucks. They were built very strong and can be fitted with new engines and transmissions. The Army also uses civilian trucks. Large semi-tractors with three rear axles tow tanks on trailers. Civilian medium and heavy trucks (some with armored cabs) are also used.\nThe US Marines use many Army trucks but they also have their own types.\nMechanical.\nEngines.\nThe Army used gasoline engines until the 1960s (in Great Britain, gasoline is called \"petrol\"). In the 1960s, they started switching to diesel engines. Some (multi-fuel vehicles) could use some gasoline or jet fuel mixed in with the diesel fuel. Now, the Army uses the same diesel engines as civilian trucks.\nAlmost all trucks have water-cooled inline 6 cylinder (I6) engines. Jeeps have inline 4 cylinder (I4) engines. Some -ton trucks have V8 engines. There are a few strange engines.\nTransmissions.\nAlmost all old Army trucks had manual transmissions. Now most have automatic transmissions. A transfer case is mounted behind the transmission. It sends power to the front axle. In manual transmission trucks it has a very low gear that can go very slowly on bad ground. Automatic transmission trucks do not need a low gear.\nChassis.\nA ladder frame has two rails going front to back with smaller rails connecting the two so that it looks like a ladder. A front solid driving axle is mounted on leaf springs. Tandem (two axles together) axles are mounted differently. They have leaf springs and arms to hold the axles. Some have the spring over the axles. Some have the leaf springs below the axles. A few extra-heavy-duty models use a simple but strong walking beam type.\nHistory.\n1915-1939.\nIn 1915, the US Army started testing trucks that were made to go off-road. They wanted to know if trucks could replace horses. Trucks could carry bigger loads and were easier to take care of. A truck can run as long as it has fuel, and a good truck should not break. A horse has to be fed and rested, and can get sick. Tests showed that trucks worked better than horses. The Army started replacing all horses and mules with trucks. One of the testers, Lieutenant Dwight D. Eisenhower, later became the President of the United States and started the Interstate Highway System.\nIn 1914, World War I started in Europe, and the British began buying American trucks. Trucks like the \"Bulldog\" Mack were good, but roads in Europe were muddy and bad.\nIn 1915, the United States Army was chasing Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa in Texas and Mexico. 4x4 trucks built by the FWD Company and Jeffery Company were tested and passed. They were built for World War I. Each truck was also built by three other companies.\nThe Army liked to have more than one company building the same trucks because more trucks could be built. If one company had problems, the other companies could keep building the trucks. A standard \"Liberty\" truck was built by 15 different companies. But most trucks in World War I were made from many small companies and broke down.\nIn the 1920s, the Army built and tested a few trucks. The truck builders didn't do much. Then, in 1930, the Army built an test group of trucks. The standard fleet come in different sizes. They were strong and reliable, but only test trucks were built. The American truck builders said the Army was taking their business away. The Army had to stop building trucks. It was the Great Depression and the Army had very little money for trucks. Builders starting making test models in 1935. By 1939, more than 20 builders had made and improved test models.\n1940-1949.\nIn 1940, the Army wanted all new off-road trucks. They wanted , , , and 5-ton 4x4s. They also wanted , 4, 6, and -ton 6x6s. Trucks were tested and changed. Good trucks were built in large numbers. Some good trucks were built by more than one company. (6-ton trucks were built by 5 companies.) In some sizes, more than one type were built. There were 3 different -ton trucks built. Trucks were named after their builder and model. Sometimes they were named by their size and how many powered wheels they had (-ton 6x6). \"M\" numbers were used to name the bodies.\nDuring World War II, the US made a large number of trucks and loaned many to other allied countries. In 1945, all truck building ended. With the war over, there were too many trucks for the Army to use. Many were left in the countries where they had been used. Jeeps and \"-ton\" trucks could be found all over the world. Most were used by armies, but some were sold to civilians.\n1950-1979.\nAfter World War II, new trucks were planned. Many trucks had worked well, but there were too many types. Companies built their own types. The Army wanted types that anybody could build. They also wanted fewer types. There would be and -ton 4x4s and 2\u00bd, 5, and 10-ton 6x6s. These trucks used many of the same parts. All large trucks used the same cab. The fenders and hoods looked the same.\n1950 is when the Army began using \"M\" numbers to namie trucks and bodies. Every truck, with every body, has its own number. (A M35 is a cargo truck and a M36 is the same truck with a longer cargo body.)\nThese types didn't change much for 25 years. A new Jeep (M151) was used from 1960. The -ton changed to a civilian type -ton size. The larger trucks were fixed up but were still the 1950s types.\n1980-2015.\nIn 1980, the Army began using new types of trucks. They began to use letters to name truck types. Most of the trucks can be armored. Dual tires are no longer used on new trucks. On most trucks, the driver or other operator can increase or decrease the amount of air in the tire while the truck is moving. This is called \"Central Tire Inflation System\" (CTIS).\nThe smalles truck is the -ton HMMWV (\"Hum-V\" or \"Hummer\"). The Army started using Hummers 1983. It is made just for the Army. It is not a changed civilian truck.\nThe same European trucks are used for and 5-ton sizes. The -ton size has 2 axles (4x4) and the 5-ton size has 3 axles (6x6). Most parts are the same for both.\nA new very heavy duty 10-ton 8x8 (4 axles) was built just for the Army. They have many bodies and some can be changed. Many have cranes to load cargo onto the truck."}

It was first broadcast on Nickelodeon on August 14, 1999. The episode is about SpongeBob and Squidward delivering a pizza in a desert.\nStory.\nThe Krusty Krab gets a phone call right before it closes. The person calling makes an order for pizza. Squidward tries to say that the Krusty Krab does not make pizza, but Mr. Krabs quickly makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties. He makes SpongeBob and Squidward deliver the pizza. Squidward tries to make SpongeBob drive a boat (that functions like a car) to get to the person's house. SpongeBob is still in boating school (driver's education), making him nervous and going very far backwards with the boat. The boat stops at a desert when does not have any more gasoline. They must deliver the pizza by walking. SpongeBob sees a truck and tries hitchhiking similar to a pioneer. However, they almost get hit by the truck. They later get stuck in a tornado that puts them far away from the road they walked on. SpongeBob thinks like a pioneer and believes that moss on a rock will get them to other people. Squidward does not believe this and walks away.\nSpongeBob and Squidward start to get hungry and tired. Squidward wants to eat the pizza but SpongeBob will not let him. SpongeBob sees a very big rock and wants to drive it similar to pioneers. Squidward tries to tell him that rocks are not vehicles, but he gets hit by SpongeBob driving the rock. SpongeBob and Squidward make it to the customer's house. The customer is happy to get the pizza, but he then gets mad because they did not give him a drink. The customer shouts at SpongeBob and makes him cry. Squidward gets angry and throws the pizza in the customer's face. Squidward says to SpongeBob that the pizza has been delivered. They drive back to the Krusty Krab using the rock.\nProduction.\n\"Pizza Delivery\" was written by Sherm Cohen, Aaron Springer, and Peter Burns. Sean Dempsey was the director of the episode's animation. Cohen was the director of the storyboard and Springer worked on drawing the storyboard. While \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" was first being made, Stephen Hillenburg wanted to make a storyboard that could be made as an episode and give it to Nickelodeon. He wanted to write an episode about SpongeBob and Squidward going on a road trip similar to the movie \"Powwow Highway\". The idea of that story was being made, but Hillenburg no longer wanted to make a storyboard for Nickelodeon. These ideas were brought back and used in \"Pizza Delivery\".\nReception.\nNancy Basile from About.com said that it is \"the perfect episode\" to show SpongeBob's big interests in the Krusty Krab and Squidward being annoyed. She says the part of the episode she likes the most is Squidward throwing the pizza in the customer's face. Bill Treadway from DVD Verdict says that it is his \"favorite out of all the episodes\" because of the episode's comedy. Emily Estep of WeGotThisCovered.com said that the episode has the \"nostalgia of being episode five\" and liked the episode's look in the relationship of SpongeBob and Squidward. Estep thought that it \"set the tone for just how strange the show could be.\" \"Pizza Delivery\" was named as the best episode of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" by the people on Nick.com in 2009."}

It was first broadcast on Nickelodeon on March 15, 2000. The episode is about SpongeBob getting stuck in a dark city named Rock Bottom. The episode was watched by about 2.1 million people when it was first broadcast. \nStory.\nSpongeBob and Patrick get on a bus after going to an amusement park. They get on the wrong bus that takes them to a 90 degree cliff. The cliff takes them to a dark city named Rock Bottom where many strange animals live. Patrick gets back on the bus but forgets to bring SpongeBob with. SpongeBob is stuck in the city and tries many times to get on another bus. He goes to a bus station and has to wait in a long line. When he gets to the front, there is only one bus left. He misses that bus and will have to wait the next day for another one. He hears a raspberry sound from far away. He runs back to the cliff to get away from the sound. He learns that a nice anglerfish was making the sound to give him a balloon. The anglerfish puts air in the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's hand. The balloon takes SpongeBob up and back to Bikini Bottom. He sees Patrick getting on another bus thinking that SpongeBob is still at Rock Bottom.\nProduction.\n\"Rock Bottom\" was written by Paul Tibbitt, Ennio Torresan, and David Fain. Tom Yasumi directed the episode's animation and Tibbitt and Torresan directed the storyboard. Merriwether Williams thought that the episode is one of the best because the story is \"so simple\". She said \"It just stayed with one idea. 'Rock Bottom' was about how he [SpongeBob] keeps missing the bus and how that makes him feel.\" She said that the story was so small that \"you could explore gags (jokes) and opportunities for gags.\"\nReception.\nThe episode was watched by about 2.1 million people when it was first broadcast. Nancy Basile from About.com said that \"The raspberries and SpongeBob's increasing frustration make this a hilarious episode.\" She says that the episode is \"relatable\" for having \"SpongeBob running up against Murphy's law\" (which states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong). Emily Estep from WeGotThisCovered.com said that the episode is \"mostly a goofy episode\" but \"also one of the scarier episodes\". She thought that the balance of cuteness and horror makes the episode known well. The roller coaster SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge was made similar to the episode."}

The unit of measurement used is the radius of the Sun (696,392\u00a0km; 432,717.927\u00a0mi).\nAdditional methods.\nA few stars are in the Zodiac, and the Moon sometimes passes in front of them. This allows calculating their size by their angular size and distance. This is not very reliable. Most do not, so astronomers calculate their size by their spectral type (which gives their luminosity), distance, and brightness. This is even less reliable.\nCaveats.\nThese objects are extremely big, thousand to millions of times the volume of our Sun, and extremely luminous. These stars also have extended atmospheres and photospheres, and are often shrouded in dust (Like Stephenson 2-18, WOH G64 , UY Scuti and VY Canis Majoris). This makes their true size uncertain. Many of these stars vary in size and brightness (like Betelguese, Antares, UY Scuti and VY Canis Majoris).\nThese objects are also far away, sometimes intergalactic (eg: WOH G64 is in the Large Magellanic Cloud). This makes it even harder to calculate their sizes. Most stars found will not be above 1,500 times the Sun's radius. Their mass would hardly hold together, and a lot of material would be ejected by powerful solar winds, forming the nebulae we see around them."}

Airing in various timeslots throughout the daytime hours and serving as BFMTV's de facto flagship news program, it features national and international news, along with sports, business and weather updates. Initially, it was an image-only show.\nHistory.\n\"Non Stop\" debuted in 2005 (as the channel's launch) and was formatted as a program devoted to hard news. It broadcast weekdays from 9:30am to 6pm, and all weekend (with two half-hour interruptions by Guillaume Vanhems at 7pm and 8pm). Its format only showed news and weather, and did not feature on-air talent in any kind.\nIn an update of schedule in May 9, 2006, the image-only format was now only featured in weekends, because weekday editions now saw presenters: Guillaume Vanhems (9:30am-1pm), Jean-Alexandre Baril (1-4:30pm) and St\u00e9phanie de Muru (4:30-6pm). The format was also revived: news every 15 minutes, with replay weather every half-hour. Weekend image-only editions were also interrupted longer, now from 6pm to 9pm, presented by Thomas Sotto.\nIn January 2007, the show's shift was relaunched, now only two presenters: Jean-Alexandre Baril from 9:30am to 2pm, then St\u00e9phanie de Muru from 2pm to 6pm.\nIn 4 June 2007, Baril's shift no longer ended at 2pm, but at noon instead to make way for \"Midi|14H\" with Florence Duprat and Thomas Misrachi.\nIn September 2007, Gilane Barret dropped the image-only block each weekend from 9pm to midnight. \nIn February 2008, St\u00e9phanie de Muru lost her Monday and Tuesday afternoon shift of the show, as Gilane Barret joined it and worked on these days. Also, Barret dropped \"Non Stop Week-End\" completely in the late slot (10pm-midnight), and unveiled an all-new show: \"Week-End 360\", alongside St\u00e9phanie de Muru. 9-10pm block now featured \"Non-Stop Week-End\" again.\n19 May 2008 brought a wide variety of changes to the show. It saw the introduction of the two-presenter format, and as a result, Diane Gouffrant joined the morning edition from 9am to noon with Baril, and the current \"Week-End 360\"'s team, St\u00e9phanie de Muru and Gilane Barret, rejoined the show's afternoon edition from 2pm to 5pm. Rachid M'Barki filled in for Barret when he was away.\nIn September 2008, the show's anchor team was changed completely. The co-host for Jean-Alexandre Baril was now Roselyne Dubois; the former morning team, who became newscasters for midday \"Midi Ruth Elklief\", run \"Non Stop\" from 2pm to 3pm; and the former midday team, Florence Duprat and Thomas Misrachi, joined the show's afternoon edition.\nAlso at this year, the 6pm-midnight block no longer aired \"Non Stop\". It was now occupied by two \"QG de l'info\" 6-7pm and 8-9pm with Marc Autheman, then \"Week-End 360\" 9pm-midnight with Rachid M'Barki and Diane Gouffrant.\nIn January 2010, afternoon \"Non Stop\" was pushed back an hour, now running from 2pm to 5pm as a result of the expansion of \"Midi Ruth Elklief\" and the debut of \"BFM Story\".\nIn March 2010, the weekend \"Non Stop\" no longer just featured the news and weather, but now included various chronicles, like press reviews in the morning daypart.\nAt the end of April 2010, several presenters exchanged their shift to each other on BFMTV. Ronald Guintrange and Roselyne Dubois was now the show's morning presenters; while afternoon edition was presented by Jean-Alexandre Baril and Florence Duprat.\nIn summer 2010, the show's afternoon edition went back to its normal broadcasting time: from 3pm to 6pm, as a result of the debut of the new \"Midi|15H\".\nIn September 2011, BFMTV shifted \"Non Stop\" from broadcasting half of the day (without presenters) to multi shows with set hosts and tone.

They were first bred more than 2,500 years ago in the Himalayan mountains of Tibet. They share genetic history with many other small dogs from Asia, like the Pekingese, Japanese Chin, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Terrier and Pug. \nEven though they are called a Tibetan Spaniel, this dog is not like a \"true\" spaniel. Spaniels are gun dogs, for hunting. Tibetan Spaniels are companion dogs, and are not useful for hunting. No one is sure how they got the name \"spaniel\" if they are not gun dogs, but it may be because Tibetan Spaniels look very similar to the small, \"lapdog\" versions of the hunting spaniels, such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\nDescription.\nAppearance.\nThe Tibetan Spaniel has a round head that is small for their size. It has a short muzzle (nose), which is smooth, without wrinkles. The nose is black. The eyes are medium-sized and oval, and are far apart from each other. The Tibetan Spaniel does not have extra skin around the eyes; this helps to tell the difference between the Tibetan Spaniel and its close relative, the Pekingese. The ears hang down either side of the head to cheek level, with furry ends, called \"feathered.\" The neck is covered in a mane of hair. Male Tibetan Spaniels have larger manes. Like their ears, their tails are feathered with fur. Their hair is \"double coated,\" with long, silky hair covering short, soft hair. \nTibetan Spaniels come in all colours and can be solid, shaded and multi-coloured. Often there are white markings on the feet. Tibetan Spaniels usually weigh between 9lbs and 15lbs, although they are sometimes bigger,\nTemperament.\nExtremely intelligent, the Tibetan Spaniel is one of the most cat-like dog breeds. They will climb on the sofa, table, dresser, etc., to see what is going on outside. \nTibetan Spaniels are a social breed that needs to spend a lot of time with people. They do not like to be left alone for long periods of time.\nThey are protective of their family. Even if they have met many different people, they are typically not very friendly with strangers. If startled or scared, a Tibetan Spaniel will express their distrust with loud alarm barking. \nWhile they love their families, Tibetan Spaniels are independent. Even though they are intelligent, and good at learning tricks and commands, they do not like to listen to instructions.\nHealth.\nThe Tibetan Spaniel is a generally healthy dog. This type of dog usually lives between 13 and 16 years. "}

The University of Saskatchewan is one of Canada\u2019s top research universities (based on the number of Canada Research Chairs) and is a member of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities (the 15 universities in Canada where the most research is done.)\nThe university began as an agricultural (farming) college in 1907 and set-up the first Canadian university-based department of extension (teaching people who have already finished school new things, without having to be a full-time student) in 1910. There were set aside for university buildings and for the U of S farm, and farming fields. In total was set aside for the university. The main University campus is situated upon , with another allocated for Innovation Place Research Park. The University of Saskatchewan agriculture college still has access to city land nearby. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) facility, (2003) develops DNA-enhanced immunization vaccines for both humans and animals.\nEver since it started out as an agricultural college, research has played an important role at the university. Discoveries made at the U of S include sulphate-resistant cement and the cobalt-60 cancer treatment unit. The university teaches more than 200 academic programs.\nCampus.\nA location next to the South Saskatchewan River, across from the city centre of Saskatoon, was picked for the campus. David Robertson Brown of Brown &amp; Vallance were the first architects making a campus plan and the first university buildings in Collegiate Gothic style: The Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, laid the first stone of the first building, the College Building, on July 29, 1910. The first building to be started on the new campus, the College Building, built 1910\u20131912 opened in 1913; in 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada.\nBrown &amp; Vallance designed the Administration Building (1910\u201312); Saskatchewan Hall Student Residence (1910\u201312). Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Engineering Building (1910\u201312) as well as additions 1913 in 1920 and rebuilt the building after it burned in 1925. Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Barn and Stock Pavilion (1910\u201312) and Emmanuel College (1910\u201312). Brown &amp; Vallance built the Faculty Club (1911\u201312) and rebuilt it after it burned in 1964. Brown &amp; Vallance constructed the President's Residence (1911\u201313) Qu'Appelle Hall Student Residence (1914\u201316) Physics Building (1919\u201321); Chemistry Building (1922\u201323); St. Andrew's Presbyterian College (1922\u201323); Memorial Gates (1927\u201328) and the Field Husbandry Building (1929).\nThe original buildings were built using local limestone \u2013 greystone \u2013 which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, this greystone became one of the most recognizable things about the campus. When the local supply of limestone ran out, the University turned to Tyndall stone, which is found in Manitoba. Saskatchewan's Provincial University and Agricultural College were officially opened May 1, 1913 by Hon. Walter Scott."}

In this area, the Tibetan Plateau is next to the Yangtze Plate with great pressure forming faults along the edges. Jiuzhaigou County is in the Min Mountains, a range that was formed where these faults meet. The disastrous 1879 Gansu earthquake had its earthquake centre about 65 kilometres\u00a0to the east of where the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake happened. The places with lots of mountains to the south of Jiuzhaigou County were the earthquake centre of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.\nInfluence.\nThe China Earthquake Administration said that the graph showed that the strength of earthquake\u00a0could be higher than level IX, and the earthquake centre in Zhangzha County could reach level VIII.\nAfter the earthquake, all of the\u00a0Jiuzhaigou County completely suffered a power failure. The people who saw the situation found that some buildings had fallen in Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area. The staff of the Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that in the fourth ditch of the Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area a house had fallen down and cracked, and the locals were stepping up to move people out.\nRescue.\nThe China Earthquake Administration put up a Level I reaction. It later changed to Level II. They sent the army to the earthquake area for rescue. At 21:26 CST (UTC+8), Health and Family Planning Commission of Sichuan Province started an emergency plan. The medical rescue team was going to head to the earthquake area within one hour.\nThe Red Cross Society of China, Sichuan Branch was on emergency standby (ready to act immediately), preparing for rescue.

She became a symbol for civil rights after she was killed during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nLife.\nHeather Heyer was born in Charlottesville. She grew up in Ruckersville, Virginia, north of Charlottesville near Shenandoah National Park. Her mother was Susan Diane Bro of Ruckersville, Virginia. Her father was Mark Heyer of Florida. Her step-father was Kim Bro. Heyer's parents separated when she was five months old.\nHeyer graduated from William Monroe High School in Stanardsville, Virginia. After high school, she got a job in a local restaurant, then got more waitressing shifts at another restaurant.\nHeyer worked in the bankruptcy department of the Miller Law Group in Charlottesville. She continued to work as a waitress, and went to school at night to improve her knowledge of law.\nUnite the Right rally.\nBefore the rally.\nOn the Friday night before the rally, hundreds of white nationalists led by Richard B. Spencer marched on the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia. Heyer's friend was livestreaming the videos on Facebook. She saw white supremacists and neo-Nazis marching with torches and openly giving Nazi salutes. Heather\u2019s friends said that the videos scared Heather. They decided not to go to Saturday\u2019s much larger Unite the Right rally, because they thought it would be even more dangerous. But later that night, Heather texted her friend, \"I feel compelled to go, to show solidarity.\"\nThe Saturday rally.\nOn the day of the rally, many people stayed away. Those who came to the rally saw demonstrators with weapons and white nationalists with Nazi and KKK symbols. In the late morning, the local government declared a state of emergency and tried to stop the rally, but no one left. Instead they moved to other streets in the downtown area. The Virginia National Guard came to help the local police, but none of them seemed to know what to do. Some of the white nationalists, including Christopher Cantwell and former KKK grand wizard David Duke, spoke to reporters.\nHeather arrived about 1 pm with two colleagues from the law firm wearing a black t-shirt and pants in preparation for her shift as a waitress later that night. They began walking down Water Street. A video shows Heyer stopping to speak to a woman wearing a helmet, apparently asking why she was with a hate group of violent white men. The women did not answer. They continued to Fourth Street, after encountering right-wing demonstrators, some with weapons. There, Heyer, her colleagues and other protesters were run down by a man driving his car through the crowd. Nineteen people were hurt. Heyer was the only fatality.\nPolice arrested the driver of the car, James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio. Fields was charged in a state court with second-degree murder, and in a federal court with 30 counts of hate crimes. He was granted an attorney to advise him in a third case, a federal civil suit.\nAfter the rally.\nA memorial service was held for Heather Heyer on Wednesday, August 16 at the Paramount Theater in Charlottesville. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and US Senator Tim Kaine attended the service. \nSusan Bro spoke to the crowd inside the 1000-seat theater, \"They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her.\" Her mother pointed to the Facebook message that Heyer posted in November: 'If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.' \"I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong ... and say to yourself, what can I do to make a difference?\" Bro told the crowd. \"And that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile. I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I've got to give her up, we're going to make it count.\"\nHeyer was buried in a secret grave to protect it from neo-Nazis, and to protect the people who work there. Bro says she receives death threats from white supremacists. Some of Heyer's family could not go to her funeral because of the danger.\nPresident Trump tried to call Heyer's mother, but after Trump said there was blame on \u201cmany sides\u201d, she refused to take his calls. Bro did not agree with Trump when he said there were \"very fine people\" on both sides. According to Bro, \"You can\u2019t say there were good people coming into town with their fists taped prepared to draw blood and do harm. That\u2019s not good people.\"\nAfter the rally, the police chief of Charlottesville resigned. The city manager did not get a new contract. In November, Nikuyah Walker was elected to the city council and became the city\u2019s first black female mayor. One year later, Jason Kessler, organizer of the rally, tried to get a permit for an anniversary rally of white supremacists, but he withdrew the request. Instead he decided he wanted a rally in Washington that day. The state of Virginia and the city of Charlottesville declared a state of emergency ahead of the one-year anniversary, so they can increase security and authorize the Virginia National Guard to help.\nLegacy.\nThe Heather Heyer Foundation.\nOne of Heyer's friends started a GoFundMe page to help her family after her death. The page raised $109,000 in less than 24 hours. Heather's mother Bro did not know what to do with the money, so she started an organization with Alfred Wilson, the African-American lawyer who hired Heyer at Miller Law Group.\nOnly fifteen days after her daughter's death, Susan Bro spoke at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards in Inglewood, California and announced the newly formed Heather Heyer Foundation. \"Help me make Heather\u2019s death count,\u201d she said. \u201cI want people to know that Heather never marched alone.\" The Heather Heyer Foundation provides scholarships to fight against hatred and promote social change, in the areas of study of law, paralegal studies, social work, social justice and education.\nSo far, the Heather Heyer Foundation has given eight scholarships worth at least $1,000. They worked with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation on several of those.\nHeather Heyer Way.\nIn December 2017, Fourth Street in Charlottesville, where Heather was killed, was given the name \"Heather Heyer Way\" to honor Heyer. Heyer's mother and the mayor of Charlottesville spoke at the ceremony.\nIn popular culture.\nDetroit rapper Eminem named Heyer in his song \"Like Home\" from the album \"Revival\", \"If we start from scratch like a scab for scars to heal/And band together for Charlottesville/And for Heather, fallen heroes.\"\n\"BlacKkKlansman\" (2018), which ends in a montage of the Charlottesville rally, is \"in memoriam\" of Heyer."}

It\" said \"that 'Teachers in those districts where the Lappish ... and Finnish (\"kv\u00e6nsk\") languages are permitted for the sake of facilitating instruction in the public schools shall do their utmost to spread knowledge of the Norwegian language and seek to promote its use in the circles where they work'\". Furthermore, the \"government had a major objective for the school[s]: Not a single Sami word was to be heard on the school grounds\" [or in school buildings].\n\"The authorities also\" used \"economic measures to carry out the work of Norwegianization, including the Land Act. A regulation [or part of the law] from 1902\" says that \"Sale [of land] may only be made to Norwegian citizens ... who can speak, read, and write the Norwegian language and use it on a day-to-day basis\".\nA report by the \"Parliamentary School Commission, appointed in 1922\" said, without being able to show [ evidence], \"that that the Sami are less educable [or able to learn] than others\"; the report also said that the Sami population is less gifted and the \"Sami culture does not lend itself to development\".\nFrom around 1850, a government policy of \"Fornorskning\" [tried to remove Sami culture]. An article in Klassekampen said that the policy was very rough [to Sami persons]. Into the 1980s, the policy of \"Fornorskning\" lasted in some places.\nCreation of associations.\n[Possibly the first] Sami association (in Norway) was started during the New Year's weekend in 1911: \"Buolbmag Same S\u00e6rvve\", in Polmak municipality.\nReindeer farming.\nReindeer farming, which is a type of animal husbandry, is done by Sami, between the White Sea and [towards the West and the South, across Russia's Kola peninsula, Finland, Sweden and Norway, into Norway's] county of Hedmark.\nIn reindeer farming, \"the Sami travel with their flocks [of reindeer] according to an established cycle\"; the cycle makes sure \"that the\" [reindeer] can eat properly during the various [or different] seasons of the year. For example, the spring migration to summer pastures, which have a rich variety of grasses and herbs, takes place just before new calves are born in May. Summer is a time when the calves grow and the adult animals regain their strength following a long, hard winter\".\nAmong the Sami people are nomads that do reindeer farming. They lived in their cold environment by domesticating the reindeer. The Lapps were able to get everything they needed from the deer. They ate mostly meat, milk, and cheese. Their clothing was made from reindeer skins and wool. Their tents were also made from raindeer skins. The wool clothes were beautifully decorated.\nThe Lapps protected the herds, moving with them as they migrated from summer to winter pastures. They used reindeer to pull sleds carrying their supplies. During the winter, the herds moved south of where the trees grew. The Lapps lived nearby in homes made of logs or sod.\nWinter clothing was made from layers of reindeer skin. The inside layer would be worn with the fur facing in toward the person's skin. The second layer was worn with the fur facing out. Boots were also made of fur and lined with grass that had been gathered during the short summer. Every evening the grass would be taken out and dried by the fire, so it would be ready to use again the next day. This way, a Lapp could be warm and comfortable in even the coldest weather.\nToday only a few of the Lapp people still follow the herds. Those few use modern tools on their ancient migration. They use snowmobiles to herd the reindeer and rifles to kill the wolves that chase them. Even helicopters and radios are used to locate and move the reindeer. Most of the Lapp people now live on small farms in one of the four nations of Lapland. They raise crops and animals, including a few reindeer, to meet their needs. The sale of reindeer meat is an important source of income for the Lapp people.\nThe Lapps were careful not to waste anything they got from the reindeer. Milk was taken from the reindeer to drink or make cheese. Meat was taken for food. The blood was frozen and then used for soup and pancakes. Knives and belt buckles were carved from the bones and antlers. The sinews (tendons) were used as sewing thread. Cleaned-out stomachs were used to carry milk or cheese. Every part of a dead reindeer was used.\nSami crafts.\nSami crafts are called \"duodji\" . The men make knives, drums and 'guksi' (burl cups) from wood, bone, and antlers. The women use leather and roots to make 'gakti' (clothing). Women also use birch and spruce to weave baskets.\nSami clothing.\nSami clothing is called 'gakti' and was originally made from reindeer leather, but now it is usually made from wool, cotton, or silk. Usually, there are different types of clothing for men and women.\nReligion and spirituality.\nSami shamanism is the main religion of the Sami people. These beliefs are connected to the land, animalism, and the supernatural. There is some practice of bear worship. Sami shamanism is a polytheistic religion. It believes there are many gods. The Sami shaman are called the 'Noadi'. There are some 'wise men' and 'wise women' who try to heal people who are sick. They use rituals and herbal medicine. Some Sami people have changed their beliefs to Christianity. They join either the Russian Orthodox Church or the Lutheran.\nIn popular culture.\nPublications by Snorri Sturluson(1178-1241) say that a Sami woman, Sn\u00f8frid, married Harald Fairhair; furthermore, none of her children or grandchildren became kings; first when Harald Hardrada became a king, then her blood became part of the blood of the royal family."}

Her father was the journalist and author Alvar Alsterdal (1926-1991) from Alster in V\u00e4rmland, Sweden. Alsterdal\u2019s mother Elsa Bolin (1928-2009) was from Tornedalen, the northernmost part of Sweden bordering Finland.\nAlsterdal grew up in Ume\u00e5 in northern Sweden and in Jakobsberg, a suburb in Stockholm that she has depicted in her novel, \u2018\"Let me take your han\"d\u2019. During her first years of her career after graduating from high school she worked as a psychiatric nurse at Beckomberga hospital, a mental institution that recurs in the novel \u2018Do not turn around\u2019.\nIn the years 1984-1985 Alsterdal studied journalism at Kalix Folkh\u00f6gskola in the north of Sweden. There she met Liza Marklund with whom she would come to work closely with, author to author.\nAlsterdal lived in the town Lule\u00e5 in Norrbotten for many years as an adult, where she among other things worked as a journalist for radio and TV, and started off her career as a playwright. Nowadays she lives in Stockholm. She has three daughters with her previous husband Nikolaj Alsterdal (n\u00e9e Andersen), the oldest born in 1999 and twins born in 2002.\nAuthorship.\nTove Alsterdal worked as a freelance journalist when she started writing drama for the fringe theatre Teater Scratch in Lule\u00e5 in the beginning of the 1990\u2019s. Later she wrote manuscripts for county theatres, opera, radio, TV and movies.\nIn the spring of 2000, Alsterdal bought Alfred Nobel\u2019s former laboratory in Vinterviken, Stockholm and ran her own cabaret theatre with her ex husband.\nWith the actress and director Helena Bergstr\u00f6m she wrote the manuscript to the movie \u2018S\u00e5 Olika\u2019 (English translation: \u2018So Different\u2019) that premiered towards the end of 2009.\nIn September 2009\nAlsterdal made her debut as a novelist with the thriller \u2018Women on the beach\u2019. The idea of the novel was at first meant to be a movie manuscript but the possible producers found it would be too expensive as the story is set in seven countries. The story centres itself around people who drown when fleeing over the Mediterranean Sea and people who are taken advantage of as slave labour in Europe. The novel was praised by critics and has been published in nineteen languages.\nThe movie rights to \u2018Women on the beach/The Forgotten Dead\u2019 are sold to the British Filmwave AB who are developing a six part TV miniseries based on the story.\nAll of Alsterdal\u2019s thrillers are standalone novels. She has been compared to the likes of Dennis Lehane and Dan Brown, and has been called \u201cthe John Le Carr\u00e9 of Sweden\u201d.\nIn 2012 her second novel, \u2018Grave of silence\u2019, was published. It is set in Tornedalen, in the north of Sweden, and is about the Swedes who emigrated to the Soviet Union in the 1930\u2019s. Alsterdals relative Nils Bucht was one of the people who disappeared under Stalin\u2019s terror. The novel was nominated as the best crime novel of the year in Sweden, the Netherlands and France.\nAlsterdals third novel, \u2018Let me take your hand\u2019, was awarded the prize for the best crime novel by the Swedish Crime Writer\u2019s Academy in 2014. The novel is set in the Stockholm suburb that the author grew up in, Jakobsberg, and in Argentina where a Swedish woman disappears during the military dictatorship in the 1970\u2019s. \u201cAn elaborate and linguistically nuanced weave of mystery and contemporary history\u201d read the motivation for the award.\nIn \u2018Do not turn around\u2019, published in 2016, Alsterdal returns to the mental hospital where she worked when she was younger. The novel depicts the collision between the place\u2019s dark past and the new residence idyll that is growing in the area. The only witness to a murder is a Romani beggar.\n\u201cNot many authors would succeed in tying together a normal townhouse life with a society in free fall, combine big politics with murder mysteries with a gripping depiction of feeling alone within one\u2019s family. But Tove Alsterdal does just that\u201d, wrote best selling author and critic Malin Persson Giolito in the magazine \u2018Amelia\u2019.\nTove Alsterdal has been author Liza Marklund\u2019s editor since \u2018Spr\u00e4ngaren\u2019 (The Bomber, 1998). She met Marklund at the school of journalism in 1984. Marklund has also been the first reader of all of Alsterdal\u2019s novels.

The Willamette's main stem is long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia.\nOriginally created by plate tectonics about 35\u00a0million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000\u00a0years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well."}

Philosophy was a way to think about the world. The term was invented in Greece. Back then it included the sciences, maths, politics, and ethics.\nGreek philosophy is one of the foundations of Western culture. It has been referred to in Rome, Islamic philosophy, and the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.\nGreek philosophy may have been somewhat influenced by the ancient Near East. Some of the most important philosophers are Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato. Alexander the Great even learned Greek philosophy before conquering the Persian empire.\nMany philosophers thought mathematics was important to all knowledge, and Euclid was one of the founders of mathematical thought. He wrote a famous book on geometry called The Elements.\nBefore Socrates.\nMany sophists were active, including Protagoras. They are known mostly from what Socrates said against them.\nPythagoras may have been a mystic or a rationalist. We do not know that much. He is known for the Pythagorean theorem.\nClassical Greek philosophy.\nSocrates.\nSocrates may have been born in Athens in the 5th century BCE. He was very important. Athens was a center of learning. People went there to talk about ideas. However, it became a crime to philosophize. Some people were accused. But Socrates was the only one who was killed in 399 BCE (see Trial of Socrates). In his defense speech (presented by Plato), he says it's because others were jealous.\nHe is considered the founder of political philosophy.\nMany of his conversations end without a conclusion. So he is known for the Socratic method. \nSocrates taught that no one wants what is bad, and so if anyone does something bad, it must be unintentional out of ignorance; he concludes that all virtue is knowledge. He often talks about his own ignorance.\nAristotle influenced Plato's dialogues and Plato's student Aristotle. Their ideas influenced the Roman empire, the Islamic Golden Age, and the Renaissance.\nPlato.\nPlato was from Athens. He came a generation after Socrates. He wrote thirty-six dialogues and thirteen letters to Socrates, though some may be fake.\nPlato's dialogues have Socrates. Along with Xenophon, Plato is the primary source of information about Socrates' life. Socrates was known for irony and not often giving own opinions. \nPlato wrote the \"Republic\", the \"Laws\", and the \"Statesman\". The Republic says there will not be justice in cities unless they are ruled by philosopher kings; those who enforcing the laws should treat their women, children, and property in common; and the individual should tell noble lies to promote the common good. The \"Republic\" says that such a city is likely impossible as it thinks philosophers would refuse to rule and the people would refuse to be ruled by philosophers.\nPlato is known for his theory of forms. It says that there are non-physical abstract ideas that have the highest form and most real kind of reality.\nAristotle.\nAristotle moved to Athens in 367 BC and began to study philosophy. He studied at Plato's Academy. He left Athens twenty years later to study botany and zoology. He became a teacher of Alexander the Great and returned to Athens ten years later to create his own school: the Lyceum. At least twenty-nine of his books have survived, known as the \"corpus Aristotelicum.\" He wrote about logic, physics, optics, metaphysics, ethics, rhetoric, politics, poetry, botany, and zoology.\nAristotle disagreed with his teacher Plato. He criticizes the governments in Plato's \"Republic\" and \"Laws\", and refers to the theory of forms as \"empty words and poetic metaphors.\" He cares more about empirical observation and practical concerns.\nAristotle was not that famous during the Hellenistic period, when Stoic logic was still popular. But later people popularized his work, which influenced Islamic, Jewish, and Christian philosophy. Avicenna referred to him simply as \"the Master\"; Maimonides, Alfarabi, Averroes, and Aquinas referred to him as \"the Philosopher.\"\nHellenistic philosophy.\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, many different schools of thought developed in the Hellenistic world and the Greco-Roman world. Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Syrians and Arabs who contributed. Persian philosophy and Indian philosophy also had an influence. \nThe spread of Christianity followed by the spread of Islam further spread Hellenistic philosophy. It influenced the three Abrahamic traditions: Jewish philosophy, Christian philosophy, and early Islamic philosophy.\nIslam.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Greek ideas were largely forgotten in Western Europe due to the Migration Period, which caused a decline in literacy. In the Byzantine Empire Greek ideas were kept and studied. \nAfter the expansion of Islam, the Abbasid caliphs started translating Greek philosophy. Islamic philosophers such as Al-Kindi (Alkindus), Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) reinterpreted these works. During the High Middle Ages Greek philosophy re-entered the West through translations from Arabic to Latin and also from the Byzantine Empire. \nThe re-introduction of these philosophies, plus new Arabic commentaries, had great influence on Medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas. \nStill Arab translators threw away books that disagreed with Islam. For example, Al-Mansur Ibn and Abi Aamir burned the Al-hakam II library in C\u00f3rdoba in 976."}

It threatened southern Texas, particularly the Corpus Christi and Victoria areas. The storm struck the state as a Category 4 hurricane on August 25.\nThe storm was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Wilma in twelve years earlier.\nThe storm first developed on August 17, 2017, from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It faded into an open tropical wave on August 19. But on August 24, Harvey redeveloped into a tropical storm, and then strengthened into a hurricane. On August 25, Harvey rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 130\u00a0mph, and it made landfall in Texas as a low-end Category 4 hurricane. On August 26, Harvey stalled and rapidly weakened into a tropical storm in just a few hours after making landfall, resulting of dumping heavy rainfall and caused major and catastrophic flooding in parts of southeastern Texas especially the Houston metropolitan area.\nHarvey was the strongest hurricane to hit Texas since Hurricane Carla in 1961.\nDamage from Harvey was set around $125 billion. This and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 are both tied as the costliest tropical cyclones on record in the Atlantic and the United States history. Harvey is the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States, especially in Texas with rainfall accumulations of over 60 inches.\nThe storm killed just over 100 people in Texas alone.\nThe name \"Harvey\" was retired in April 2018 by the World Meteorological Organization and was replaced with \"Harold\" for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season."}

The name was changed to Dravidar Kazhagam in 1944.\nIts central theme was to remove the degraded status imposed on Dravidians, and to denote this, the party adopted a black flag with a red circle inside it, the black signifying their degradation and the red denoting the movement for upliftment.It opposed Brahminical social, political and ritual dominance, and aimed to form a separate country of Dravida Nadu, to include either all of South India or the predominantly Tamil-speaking regions."}

He sat in several lecture courses as a student, but the anatomical lecture by a Doctor Knox made him choose the career path of midwifery and obstetrics. He became a qualified professor of midwifery at the age of 29, in 1840.\nDue to his traumatizing observations of surgery as a student, he decided to experiment with anesthetics. He tried using ether and chloroform, but refused to use ether due to its bad odor. He discovered the anesthetic properties of chloroform, using it in obstetrics, to make childbirth easier and safer. He also invented a new design for the forceps, to make them safer to use. They are now known as \"Simpsons' forceps\". He was one of the earliest doctors to use midwifes in hospitals. \nChloroform was a good idea, as it put people to sleep, making surgical procedures safer, pain-free, and better for the individuals. It was recognized as an achievement when Queen Victoria herself received chloroform to give birth to her fourth child."}

It is mostly spoken in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. There are approximately 6,915,000 total speakers of this language. There are approximately 4,320,000 in Ethiopia and approximately 2,540,000 in Eritrea. Tigrinya is also spoken by emigrants from these regions, including some Ethiopian Jews.\nHistory and literature.\nThe earliest written example of Tigrinya is a text of local laws found in Logosarda district, Southern Region, Eritrea. It is from the 13th century.\nTigrinya is related to the Ethiopian Semitic language Ge'ez. However, Tigrinya has a different word order than Ge'ez, and there are some more differences in grammar. However, the two languages have similar phonology and morphology, which show they are related. Ge'ez has influenced Tigrinya literature, especially with words about Christian life. Until recent times, Ge'ez was used for writing more often than Tigrinya was. When the British ruled Eritrea, there was a newspaper written in Tigrinya.\nTigrinya was one of Eritrea's official languages while it was part of Ethiopia; in 1958 it was replaced with the language Amharic. During the rule of Emperor Haile Selassie (1930-1974), publications in Tigrinya were banned. When Selassie lost power, Amharic remained the standard language. In 1991, Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia. Tigrinya was the \"working language\" in Eritrea.\nSpeakers.\nThere are 6,915,000 total Tigrinya speakers. Of these, approximately 4,320,000 live in Ethiopia. Most Tigrinya speakers in Ethiopia live in the Tigray region. There are approximately 2,540,000 Tigrinya speakers in Eritrea. Most of these live in the southern and central areas of the country. There are also over 10,000 Beta Israel speakers of Tigrinya.\nTigrinya is the fourth most spoken language in Ethiopia after Amharic, Oromo, Somali and the most widely spoken language in Eritrea. It is also spoken by immigrants around the world. In Australia, Tigrinya is broadcast on public radio on the Special Broadcasting Service.\nThere are two dialects of Tigrinya: Northern and Southern.\nNorthern Dialect\nSouthern Dialect\nPhonology.\nTigrinya has a set of ejective consonants and seven vowels.\nA Tigrinya syllable may have a consonant-vowel or a consonant-vowel-consonant sequence.\nWriting system.\nTigrinya is written in the Ge'ez script (Ethiopic script), which was originally developed for the Ge'ez language. The Ge'ez script is an abugida. Each symbol represents a consonant+vowel syllable.\nNote: Symbols falling into disuse in Tigrinya are shown with a dark gray background in the table."}

They do not date to a particular period, but rather stretch across the entire history of Hinduism, beginning with the some of the earliest known Hindu texts, spanning into the modern period with the Upanishads.\n\u015aruti has no author; rather, it is divine recording of the \"cosmic sounds of truth\", heard by rishi. They are timeless teachings transmitted to rishis, or seers, directly by God thousands of years ago. Sruti is thus said to be apaurusheya, \"impersonal,\" or rather \"suprahuman.\"\nSruti consists essentially of the Vedas and the agama, preserved initially through oral tradition and eventually written down in Sanskrit. Among the many sacred books of the Hindus, these two bodies of knowledge are held in the highest esteem. For countless centuries shruti has been the basis of philosophical discussion, study and commentary, and this attention has given rise to countless schools of thought. It is also the subject of deep study and meditation, to realize the wisdom of the ancients within oneself.\nMost mantras are drawn from sruti, used for rites of worship, both public and domestic, as well as personal prayer and japa. It is a remarkable tribute to Hindu culture that so much of sruti was preserved for thousands of years without alteration by means of oral instruction from guru to shishya, generation after generation. In the Veda tradition this was accomplished by requiring the student to learn each verse in eleven different ways, including backwards. Traditionally sruti is not read, but chanted according to extremely precise rules of grammar, pitch, intonation and rhythm. This brings forth its greatest power. In the sacred language of shruti, word and meaning are so closely aligned that hearing these holy scriptures properly chanted is magical in it's effect upon the soul of the listener.\nAyush The Hacky"}
