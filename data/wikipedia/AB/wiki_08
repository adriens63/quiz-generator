Unlike the more advanced ichthyosaurs, \"Utatsusaurus\" has no dorsal fin and has a broad skull. The snout gently tapers, compared to the more rounded one of more derived ichthyopterygians. The tail had a long low fin, quite different from the tail shape of later forms.

It is made of hardened sap from two species of acacia tree; \"Senegalia (Acacia) senegal\" and \"Vachellia (Acacia) seyal\". The gum is got from wild trees throughout the Sahel from Senegal to Somalia. In the past it has also been cultivated in Arabia and west Asia. \nGum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. It was historically the source of the sugars arabinose and ribose, both of which were first discovered and isolated from it.\nProduction.\nAcacia gum has been harvested in Arabia, Sudan, and west Asia since antiquity, and sub-Saharan acacia gum has a long history as a prized export. Traditionally harvested by semi-nomadic desert tribes on their travels, acacia gum is a main export of several African nations. The hardened gum is collected in the middle of the rainy season (harvesting usually begins in July), and exported at the start of the dry season (November).\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1990s Sudan did about 80% of gum arabic production. Today, the figure is under 50%. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are dependent on gum arabic for their livelihoods. It is still the world's largest single producer, and the production of gum arabic is heavily controlled by the Sudanese government.\nUses.\nFood.\nIn food, gum arabic is used as a stabilizer. It is edible and has E number E414. Arab populations use the natural gum to make a chilled, sweetened, and flavored gelato-like dessert.\nInk.\nGum arabic has been used from ancient times as part of black ink. The main constituent is carbon soot from lamps or burnt plant material. Apart from water and gum arabic, the ancient Egyptian ink was made of not much else. Written on paper or papyrus, this ink has survived for over three thousand years.\nGum arabic is a key ingredient in traditional lithography and is used in printing, paint production, glue, cosmetics and various industrial applications, including viscosity control in inks and in textile industries. Nowadays less expensive materials compete with it for many of these roles.\nPainting and art.\nGum arabic is used as a binder for watercolor painting because it dissolves easily in water. Pigment of any colour is suspended in the acacia gum to get in watercolor paint. Water acts as a vehicle to thin the watercolor paint and helps to transfer the paint to a surface such as paper. When all moisture evaporates, the acacia gum binds the pigment to the paper surface. After the water evaporates, the acacia gum in the paint film increases luminosity and helps prevent the colors from lightening. Gum arabic allows more precise control over washes, because it prevents them from flowing or bleeding beyond the brush stroke. In addition, acacia gum slows evaporation of water, giving slightly longer working time.\nPhotography.\nThe historical photography process used gum arabic mixed with ammonium or potassium dichromate and pigment to create a coloured photographic emulsion that becomes relatively insoluble in water upon exposure to ultraviolet light. In the final print, the acacia gum permanently binds the pigments onto the paper."}

The battles were some of the bloodiest battles of the war.\nBackground.\nIn the spring of 1864, Grant had been appointed to command all Union armies. Grant's plan to end the war had several parts. Union General William Tecumseh Sherman's Atlanta Campaign and Grant's Overland Campaign were supported by other campaigns. They were all intended to keep Lee from reinforcing his main army. George Meade was still in (nominal) command of the Army of the Potomac, but there was little doubt Grant was in direct control of the army's movements.\nGrant ordered General Franz Sigel to advance down the Shenandoah Valley to prevent reinforcements and supplies from reaching Lee's army. Grant ordered Benjamin F. Butler's Union Army of the James to cut the rail lines between Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. This interrupted Lee's main supply line. Grant wanted to force Lee to attack even though Lee had no reinforcements and few supplies.\nThe campaigns were all to start at the beginning of May. The Army of the Potomac crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, moving south towards The Wilderness before Lee could attack them. But Lee attacked while Grant's army was still trying to move through the tangled forest. The Battle of the Wilderness started the campaign."}

He had several top government jobs. He is best known as the leader of the Knights of Labor in the late 1880s. \nCareer.\nTerence V. Powderly was born in Carbondale, Pennsylvania on 22 January 1849. His parents, Terence Powderly and Madge Walsh, were Irish immigrants. As a young man he worked for the railroad as a . In 1871, he became a member of the International Machinists and Blacksmiths union. He later became its president. During the Long Depression (1873\u20131879), he didn't have a job. He was blacklisted for being a 'union '. \nIn Scranton in 1876, Powderly joined the local branch of the Knights of Labor. He quickly moved up in the union. By 1879, he became the leader (his title was \"Grand Master Workman\"). While he was the leader, the Knights of Labor had the most members and most influence it ever had. After 1886, the Knights declined. In a struggle for power, Powderly was removed. His rival John William Hayes became the leader. Having lost his position, Powderly studied to become a lawyer. In 1894 he was admitted to the Bar (became a lawyer) in Pennsylvania. For this he was thrown out of the Knights of Labor.\nWhile he was the Grand Master Workman, he was also the mayor of Scranton (1878\u20131884). In the 1896 presidential campaign, he supported Republican William McKinley. As a reward, President McKinley appointed Powderly United States Commissioner General of Immigration in 1897. He was dismissed as Commissioner General in 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt. Powderly's work for immigration reform led to his dismissal. But in 1906 an investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing. He was given the position of Special Immigration Inspector. He then became Chief of the Division of Information in the US Department of Immigration from 1907 to 1921. Next he became Commissioner of Conciliation for the United States Department of Labor (1921\u20131924).\nLegacy.\nPowderly died in Washington, DC on 24 June 1924. Many early labor historians have been very critical of Powderly and the Knights of Labor. However, very few did more for the early labor movement. The actions and accomplishments of Terence V. Powderly have been reevaluated in the last twenty years. While he still has not had a \"competent biographer\", it is clear he and his Knights are becoming much more admired and respected. In 1999, Powderly was inducted into the Hall of Honor at the US Department of Labor."}

Its fossils were found in Kansas, USA.\n\"Petrolacosaurus\" was too derived to be the ancestor of all modern forms. In fact, it was already a diapsid, with two openings on each side of its skull to add attachment points for jaw muscles. Hence, it cannot have been the ancestor of any synapsids, which have only one such opening. Synapsids diverged from the common amniote tree before the diapsids did.\nBBC Television in \"Walking with Dinosaurs\" made the mistake of talking about it as an ancestor of both reptiles and mammals."}

The oil which is hot is circulated into a water storage system where it is used to change water into superheated steam, that then turns a turbine to generate electricity. The heat that is produced through this process powers a Stirling engine. The Stirling engine provides electricity and mechanical energy by having the fluid from within a cylinder expand, which then drives a piston that turns a shaft.\nSolar thermal energy is primarily used domestically for space heating, hot water, and in some cases air conditioning. Solar thermal energy is renewable and no fuels are required during the process to generate electricity or mechanical energy. It is also carbon free except for production and transportation, otherwise it is non-polluting. Solar thermal can also be combined with photovoltaics (PVs), in highly efficient cogeneration systems. Some downsides are that solar thermal generates low grade energy, installation and construction costs are very high, it is expensive compared to conventional water heaters, and is hard to compete against cheap natural gas. An example of a Solar Thermal Electric Generation Plant is the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System that uses 300,000 computer-controlled mirrors, that focuses sunlight to the top of 459-foot towers, where water is turned into steam to power turbines."}

Scrubbers remove sulfur from a power plant's exhaust. Scrubbers are of two types, wet scrubbers and dry scrubbers. Wet scrubbers use liquid chemicals to remove pollutants. Dry scrubbers typically use fabric filters. In many cases both are used together. As polluted air passes through a wet scrubber, chemicals in the scrubber react with the air pollution causing it to precipitate out. Modern scrubbers can remove up to 98% of the sulfur and 99% of the precipitate matter from within the smokestacks. The sulfur and metals that are removed from the scrubbers can be sold as a marketable products. Sludge from lime scrubbers can be sold to wallboard manufacturers, and fly ash from chimney flues can be sold to make lightweight concrete that can substitute for wood. The use of coal in the United States about doubled during the last quarter (25 years) of the 20th century. However, sulfur in the air was reduced by 30% during that same period.

It is the ninth-highest award by order of in the US Military. It may be awarded for acts of heroism, acts of merit, or meritorious service in a combat zone. When it is awarded for acts of heroism, the medal is awarded with the \"V\" device attached. The required acts are less heroic than those that qualify for the Silver Star.\nEligibility.\nThe medal is sometimes called the Bronze Star. Foreign soldiers, as well as officers from the other federal uniformed services are also eligible to receive the decoration. They must be serving with a service branch of the United States Armed Forces.\nHistory.\nThe Bronze Star Medal was an idea by Colonel Russell P. \"Red\" Reeder in 1943. He believed it would aid if there was a medal which could be awarded by captains of companies or batteries to deserving people serving under them. Reeder felt another medal was needed for ground forces that was equivalent to the Air Medal. He proposed that the new award be called the \"Ground Medal\". The idea eventually gained support. General George C. Marshall wrote a memorandum (note) to President Franklin D. Roosevelt dated 3 February 1944. He wrote: \nThe Air Medal had been adopted two years earlier to raise airmen's morale. President Roosevelt authorized the Bronze Star Medal by Executive Order 9419 dated 4 February 1944. The order was made to 7 December 1941. The Executive Order was amended by President John F. Kennedy. The Executive Order 11046 dated 24 August 1962 expanded the authorization to include those serving with friendly forces. This allowed for awards where US service members might be involved in an armed conflict where the United States was not a . At the time of the Executive Order the US was not a belligerent in Vietnam. So any US advisers serving with the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces would not have been eligible for the award.\nA study was conducted in 1947. The outcome was the policy was changed to make the retroactive award of the Bronze Star Medal (without the \"V\" device) to all soldiers who had received the Combat Infantryman Badge. It also included those who received the Combat Medical Badge during World War II.

It is awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed, while serving, on or after April 5, 1917, with the U.S. military. It is the successor to the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth. The Purple Heart is the oldest military award still given to U.S. military members. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York.\nHistory.\nThe original Purple Heart, called the \"Badge of Military Merit\", was established by George Washington in 1782. The Badge of Military Merit was only awarded to three Revolutionary War soldiers. If any more had been awarded, any records of being given that award have been lost. The badge was never abolished, it was just forgotten about until after World War I. \nIn 1932 General Douglas MacArthur urged the revival of the Purple Heart medal and he was awarded the first one. The War Department authorized the medal under General Order Number 3. The award was \"to be awarded to persons who, while serving in the Army of the United States perform any singular meritorious act of extraordinary fidelity or essential service.\" \nWith the establishment of the Legion of Merit award, the Purple Heart was no longer awarded for meritorious service. By Executive Order 9277, dated December 3, 1942, the award was to only be given for wounds received. Additional Executive orders added circumstances where the award can be given. In 1962 it was ordered the medal could be given posthumously (after the person died). A 1984 change allowed the award to be given for wounds recieved as a result of terrorist attacks or while serving as part of a peacekeeping force. In 1986 public Law 99-145 authorized the award for wounds received as a result of friendly fire. \nBecause the medal was given out during many conflicts, the exact number of Purple Hearts awarded is not known.\nOrder of Precedence.\nThe Purple Heart medal is worn on the uniform after the Bronze Star Medal. It is to be worn before the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. In the Army and Air Force when a second or more Purple Heart is awarded, oak leaf clusters are used. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard use 5/16 inch stars to show multiple awards."}

The first definitons of algebraic variety defined it as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations, over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion while they try to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition.\nConventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ: Some authors require that an \"algebraic variety\" is, by definition, \"irreducible\" (which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology), while others do not. When the former convention is used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets.\nThe notion of variety is similar to that of manifold. One difference between a variety and a manifold is that a variety may have singular points, while a manifold will not. \nProven around the year 1800, the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one variable with complex coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the set of its roots (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry."}

It means that two polygons, line segments, or other figures can become the same via resizing. Similar objects do not need to have the same size. Two shapes are similar if their angles have the same measure and their sides are proportional. Two circles, squares, or line segments are always similar. If figure formula_1 is similar to figure formula_2, then we write formula_3.\nWhen it comes to similarity, triangles are special. This is because triangles can be similar if only their angles are equal, or only their sides are proportional. All other polygons must meet both of the conditions.\nSimilarity is very similar to congruence. Congruent shapes have the same sides and angles. Because of that, two shapes are congruent to each other if one can become another through rotating, reflecting or moving only. In fact, all shapes that are congruent to each other are also similar, but not vice versa."}

The Distinguished Service Cross is the same as the Navy Cross (Navy and Marine Corps). The Air Force) has the Air Force Cross and the Coast Guard has the equivalent Coast Guard Cross. All are equivalent (equal) awards.\nHistory.\nThe Distinguished Service Cross was first awarded during World War I. In addition, a number of awards were made for actions before World War I. These were to soldiers who had received a 'Certificate of Merit' for gallantry. At the time the certificate was given it was the only other honor for gallantry the Army could award other than a Medal of Honor. Others were awarded for earlier actions in the Philippines, on the Mexican Border and during the Boxer Rebellion.\nCriteria.\nThe Distinguished Service Cross may be awarded to any person serving in any capacity with the United States Army. The person must distinguish himself or herself by extraordinary heroism while engaged in an action against an enemy. Or, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing/foreign force or while serving with friendly forces. The act or acts of heroism must have been so notable and have involved risk of life so extraordinary as to set the individual apart from his or her comrades.

Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of geometry.\nThe main objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates, and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points, the inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.\nAlgebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics. The concepts it uses connects it to such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. At the start, algebraic geometry was about studying systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Algebraic geometry starts at the point where equation solving leaves off: In many cases, finding the properties all the solutions a given set of equations have is more important than finding a particular solution: this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.\nIn the 20th century, algebraic geometry has split into several subareas.\nMuch of the development of the main stream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on \"intrinsic\" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space. The developments in topology, differential and complex geometry occurred much in the same way. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles's proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of the power of this approach."}

Blarney is in the historic Irish Province of Munster. The Blarney Stone is in the castle. The Blarney Stone is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Ireland.\nDescription.\nBlarney Castle is a well preserved 15th century building. It is in the small town of Blarney, County Cork in Ireland. Blarney is about 6 miles northwest of the city of Cork. There are not many good buildings in County Cork that were built before the 19th century. The castle is also one of Ireland's oldest and most historic castles. The walls of the castle are up to 18 feet thick.\nHistory.\nBlarney Castle was built in 1446 by Dermot MacCarthy. He was King of South Munster. The castle is the third building on the site. The first was built of wood. In about 1210 a stone building was built in place of the wooden one. Finally, in 1446 the current castle was built by MacCarthy.\nQueen Elizabeth I of England wanted the castle. She told the Earl of Leicester to get it for her. However, he was never able to get it because MacCarthy always made excuses to stop it happening.\nOliver Cromwell's army won the castle by force. They did not capture the soldiers living in it though. They had escaped through tunnels and caves underneath.\nThe Blarney Stone.\nThe Blarney Stone is a slab of limestone. The size of the stone is about 4 feet long and 1 foot wide. It is built into the castle's battlements 83 feet up from the ground.\nThere are lots of myths about where the stone came from. Some say it came from the prophet Jeremiah. Some say it came from Stonehenge. It is supposed to have been given to Dermot MacCarthy by Robert the Bruce. The gift was for help fighting against the English at the 1314 battle of Bannockburn.\nIn 2014 scientists in Scotland examined a piece of the stone. They found that it was a piece of limestone from close to the castle. The stone is about 330 million years old.\nTourist attraction.\nThe Blarney stone is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions. Hundreds of tourists visit Blarney Castle every day. The visitors go to kiss the Blarney Stone. People think that kissing the stone will give them the \"gift of the gab\" (make them good at talking). There is usually a long queue of people waiting to kiss it. To kiss the stone people have to lie on their backs and let their heads hang back over a ledge."}

Early attempts at mechanical removal and poisonous chemicals failed, so in a last resort, biological control was attempted.

His theory is that all of reality is made up of force itself. His theory predicts that electricity, light, and gravity have finite propagation delays. Einstein's theory agrees with this. \nOne can make magnetic field lines show as if they were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to 'field lines'. \nIf there are a lot of lines through a magnet and not a great space between them, the magnet is strong. If the lines between a magnet are far apart and there aren't many lines, the magnet is weak. A way of determining the strength of a magnet is to do an experiment with iron filings. The iron filings will get attracted to the magnet and move into the shape of the flux lines. You then look at the shape of the iron filings and see the gap between the flux lines. This gives you an idea of the strength of the magnet. \nThe use of iron filings to display a field \"alters the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the \"lines\" of iron\". This caused by the large permeability of iron relative to air. Magnetic fields' \"lines\" are also visually displayed in polar auroras, when particles cause visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\nMagnetic field lines are like the contour lines (constant altitude) on a topographic map in that they represent something continuous, and a different mapping scale would show more or fewer lines. There is an advantage to using magnetic field lines as a representation. Many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the 'number' of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical form.\nThe actual magnetic field \"itself\" does not have \"lines\" in it; the \"lines\" are solely the iron filings becoming polarized themselves, reacting to each other and the field, lining up N and S with respect to each other \"in\" the field. If you could see the actual \"fields\" of force, it would be shaded and gradient, with a heavier, thicker shade near the stronger part of the magnet, fading the further you get from the source. And in all 3 dimensions, which iron filing demonstrations cannot reproduce. Ferrofluids will react in all 3 dimensions and can more accurately reproduce a field, except for gravity creating a weight restriction. Holding a strong magnet in front of a CRT-type monitor with a white screen can also give a representation of the fields, without any \"lines of force\" visible. The issue with using ferro/magnetic materials to view a field is, the materials themselves become magnetized and change the original field to include their own influence. "}

The females are larger than the males. Most of these lizards are colored in camouflaging shades of desert browns and tans. These colors change from pale colors during warm weather and to darker colors during cold weather. These animals are covered entirely with conical spines that are mostly uncalcified (not bony).\nFemale thorny devils lay ten eggs during the September-December season (or Spring-Summer). They put the eggs in a burrow about 30\u00a0cm deep.

The water travels up these channels to the lizard\u2019s mouth."}

Her family moved from Virginia to Nashville, Tennessee. The Robards family was quite wealthy and important in Nashville. Rachel was married to Captain Lewis Robards in Kentucky.

Rachel was short, quiet, and common. One girl who visited their house would not have guessed that they were married. She thought they were too different. The visitor said that Rachel was kind and motherly, not elegant or graceful. Rachel had lived in the frontier (newly-lived in areas) her whole life. She had no reason to become elegant.\nRachel loved Andrew very much. She was sad every time he went away. Once, she travelled to meet him, which was not common for women to do. She was very worried when he was in danger. She became quite sick from stress. Her marriage was very important to her. A visitor once said that their love was very great.

Hewas one of the spiritual founders of Catalonia. At that time, he may have been the most important churchman of his age in the Iberian Peninsula.\nOliba was also a writer. He and his monks in the \"scriptorium\" at Ripoll wrote a lot of works about his world. His most important writing may have been his translations of Arabic manuscripts into Latin.\nFamily.\nWe don't know exactly when Oliba was born but it was near 971. He was born to a rich family. He was the third son of a Catalan count, which is a type of nobleman. He gave up his possessions to take up the Benedictine habit in the Monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll. He had three brothers and a sister.\nAs count.\nIn 988, Count Oliba Cabreta took the habit, meaning he became a monk, and retired to Montecassino with St. Romuald, which met in Cuix\u00e0.\nOliba begin to perform his duties as a count, a type of medieval nobleman. His brother Bernard inherited Besal\u00fa and Guifr\u00e9 Cerdanya, Oliva received Berga and Ripoll.\nBetween 988 and 1002, Oliva was Count of Berga and Ripoll. He was associated with his brother Guifr\u00e9.\nChurch life.\nOliba promoted the idea of Peace and Truce of God (Catalan: \"Pau i Treva de D\u00e9u\"), until 1022. In 1027, he signed an agreement with other bishops and noblemen in Toulouges (Roussillon). In this treaty, they all agreed to decide on days when no one would fight battles with anyone else and fugitives could run to churches.\nOliba was very influential. In 1023, King Sancho III of Navarre asked him for advice because he wanted his sister Urraca to her second cousin Alfonso V of Le\u00f3n. Obliba said not to do it, but Sancho ignored him. His letters to the various contemporaneous kings of Spain indicate to us that Alfonso and his successor, Vermudo III, were regarded as \"imperatore. \"And the king of Navarre was a mere \"rex\".\nOliba started or reformed the monasteries of Montserrat (1025), Fluvi\u00e0, and Canig\u00f3. He consecrated or patronized many other churches, such as the Collegiate Basilica of Manresa. He started the Assemblies of Peace and Truce, which later became Catalonia's \"corts\", or parliament. He improved the decoration of his own church at Ripoll and rededicated it on January 15, 1032. He was a close advisor to Count Berengar Raymond I of Barcelona and he rebuilt the cathedral of Vic with help from Countess Ermesinda. The new cathedral was rededicated to Peter and Paul on August 31, 1038. He died at his monastery at Cuix\u00e0 in 1046.\nMonk and abbot.\nIn August 1002, when Oliba was 31 years, he became a monk of the Benedictine Order in the Monastery of Ripoll.\nIn 1008, after the death of Abbot Seniofr\u00e9, Olive was elected abbot, or leader, of the monastery. Months later he was also elected abbot of the Monastery of St. Miquel de Cuix\u00e0. Oliba decided the monastaries should be more austere and disciplined.\nBy the next year, Oliba had become a little famous. In 1009, he was also elected abbot of Sant Mart\u00ed del Canig\u00f3. Other monasteries liked his way of running things, such as the monasteries of Sant Feliu and Sant Sadurn\u00ed Tav\u00e8rnoles.\nOliba spent his time and energy defend the property and rights of churches against attacks by his manor. In 1011, he went to the Vatican to meet the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Sergius IV, and he won a number of bulls, which are papal rulings, for his monasteries. These papal bulls had significant power: the Pope, whom medieval Catholics considered God's representative on earth, said that the monasteries and lands owned were under the protection of St. Peter and the attack on the monastery was an aggression against the authority of the Pope.\nSanta Maria de Ripoll.\nIn the late tenth century, Catalonia became an important place for culture and art. The people there had access to Arabic science and the places where monks wrote and made copies of other pieces of writing, called \"scriptoria\", became some of the best in Europe.\nRipoll was the most important scriptorum in Catalonia. With help from things he learned at Ripoll, Pope Sylvester II introduced the Arabic numbers, the concept of zero, and the astrolabe to Europe. During Oliba's time, the library at Ripoll gained three the number of pieces of writing, together with the Bobbio, it became one of the most important libraries in the Christian world during the middle ages.\nSant Miquel de Cuix\u00e0.\nOliba made architectural modifications to this monastery. Oliba had a walkway built around the sanctuary with three apses. Then, he built a dome over the altar and the crypt. He also erected Nativity, Chapel of the Trinity and the two towers Lombard, of which only one is still standing today.\nSant Mart\u00ed del Canig\u00f3.\nThe monastery of St. Mart\u00ed del Canig\u00f3 was founded by Oliba's brother, Count Gifr\u00e9 II of Cerdanya-Conflent. Gifr\u00e9 took an old church at the foot of Canig\u00f3 and became an important monastery. \nIn 1009, this church and its community was made up of monks from Cuix\u00e0. It was ruled by Abbot Oliba through his community until 1014, when it had enough monks appoint an abbot of its own."}

The village was carbon dated to about 2600 B.C.\nThe monument was on \"an extraordinary scale\" and unique, researchers said.\nThe Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes team has been creating an underground map of the area in a five-year project.\nRemote sensing and geophysical imaging technology has been used to reveal evidence of nearly 100 stones without the need for excavation.\nThe monument is just under two miles (3km) from Stonehenge, Wiltshire, and is thought to have been a Neolithic ritual site.\nIt is the \"largest Neolithic settlement in the whole of northern Europe\". At 500m in diameter, the henge is the largest in Britain and recent evidence suggests that it was a complementary monument to Stonehenge.\nWhat visibly remains of Durrington Walls today is the 'walls' of the henge monument. This is now a ridge surrounding a central basin. Originally the ditch was some 5.5m deep, 7m wide at its bottom and 18m wide at the top. The bank was in some areas 30m wide. There were two entrances through the bank and ditch \u2013 at the north western and south eastern ends. The henge enclosed several timber circles and smaller enclosures \u2013 not all of which have been excavated. Several Neolithic house floors have been found next to and under the eastern bank of the henge. Their density suggests that there was a very large village on the sloping river bank on this side.\nAbout three feet underneath Durrington Walls, there are remains of about 90 standing stones, maybe from an earlier time. The stones are in a \"slightly curved row.\" They were found in 2015, using special archaeological research tools and methods including ground-penetrating radar. Scientists do not know if this feature is the same age as early Stonehenge or not. "}

Its remains were found in North and South Dakota. The type species is \"Anzu wyliei\".\n\"Anzu wyliei\" had a toothless beak, a prominent crest, long arms ending in slender relatively straight claws, long powerful legs with slender toes, and a very long tail. In life, the animal was about to long and to in weight. It was one of the largest known oviraptorosaurs and the largest known from North America (though the giant Mongolian oviraptorosaur \"Gigantoraptor\" was far larger).\nThe type species is the first well-preserved example of a North American oviraptorosaur. According to a paleontologist at the Smithsonian \"for almost a hundred years, the presence of oviraptorosaurs in North America was only known from a few bits of skeleton, and the details of their appearance and biology remained a mystery. With the discovery of \"A. wyliei\", we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like and how it is related to other dinosaurs\". The creature's formidable appearance \u2013 \"big crests on their skulls, a beak, no teeth, and a very bird-like skeleton\" \u2013 led to it being jokingly called the \"chicken from hell\" in press releases.\nThe fossils of \"Anzu wyliei\" were found in mudstone rock that had once been part of ancient floodplains. Its Asian counterparts lived in arid or semi-arid conditions. \nIts lifestyle was that of \"a fast-running, ecological generalist that didn't quite fit the usual moulds of meat-eating or plant-eating dinosaur\". It was not on the direct line of descent of modern birds, but it did have bird-like features: \nThe function of \"Anzu's\" large crest is debated. The crest \"is very large and made of paper-thin bone, so it was not able to take much stress. All oviraptosaurs have this crest but it is certainly the largest in \"A. wyliei\"\". The most likely function is for display, signalling to members of its own species. Also, it might be used to attract a mate. \nThe fossils showed evidence of injuries, including a healed broken rib and an arthritic toe that was probably the result of a tendon being ripped away from the bone. It is not known whether this indicates that the animals fought each other, or were injured by predators."}

It is also a community called St Davids and the Cathedral Close. It is in Pembrokeshire, Wales on the River Alun. It is where Saint David is buried, who is the patron saint of Wales. St Davids first became a city in the 12th century, but it was demoted in 1886. In the UK, the monarch gives or takes away whether a place is a city or not. In 1994, Queen Elizabeth II made St Davids a city again.\nHistory.\nIn the 6th century, Saint David started a monastery and church on the banks of the River Alun at a place called Glyn Rhosyn (Rose Vale). The area was first called \"Mynyw\" in Welsh. The Romans called it \"Meneva\" or \"Menevia\". The people of the monastery grew food and did other crafts, like beekeeping. They also fed the poor.\nThe area that grew around the monastery became known in Welsh as \"Tyddewi\", which means \"David's house\". In 519, the archbishop of Caerleon was moved to the monastery. \"Tyddewi\" was renamed \"St Davids\" in name of the saint who founded the place. The first cathedral that was built was attacked many times by the Vikings, and burned down in 1087. The cathedral that is there now was built by the Normans. Many pilgrims travelled to St Davids because Saint David was from there."}

A seizure is caused by problems in the electrical activity in the brain.\nOne syndrome is \"Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures\" (BINS) and the other is \"Benign familial neonatal seizures\" (BFNS). Both syndromes usually happen in infants in the neonatal period, which is the first 28 days after birth. In most cases, the first seizure happens within the first few days after birth. However, some infants may have their first seizure later in the neonatal period, or even months after the neonatal period. The last seizure usually happens while the infant is still in the neonatal period, but seizures may continue after this time.\nA third syndrome called \"benign familial neonatal-infantile syndrome\" (BFNIS). It may cause the first seizure between the second day upwards to 6 months after birth, and usually stops within the first 12 months.\nThese syndromes are called \"\"benign\" because they usually cause no long-term harm to the infant, but there is a greater chance of getting seizures later in life.\nIn Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures the cause is not known (this is what the word \"idiopathic\"\" means). In Benign familial neonatal seizures and Benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures, there is a \"genetic mutation,\" which means a change in the genes that an infant gets from their parents.

During his time there, he was able to win the Memorial Cup with the Rockets and won the WHL airBC Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Playoffs.\nHe was drafted with the 49th overall pick by the Nashville Predators in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. On July 8, 2010, he was named the fifth captain in Nashville Predators history, replacing Jason Arnott, who was traded to the New Jersey Devils. He became the youngest captain in Predators history and was the only captain of the Predators to have been drafted by the team.\nDuring the 2012 offseason, the Predators were unable to take Weber to arbitration again (a player can only be subjected to team-elected arbitration once in his career). Weber signed a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million of it as a signing bonus, with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. It was the richest contract in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, which surpassed the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek. The Predators, who had already lost Weber's defensive partner Ryan Suter to unrestricted free agency, were able to match the offer sheet five days later.\nOn June 29th 2016, Shea Weber was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for P.K. Subban."}

Minsky is sometimes described as a post-Keynesian economist because, like Keynes, he supported some government intervention in financial markets. He opposed some of the financial deregulation policies popular in the 1980s. He supported the Federal Reserve as a \"lender of last resort\" (which means he thought it right for the Fed to bail out banks which might go bust). He argued against too much private debt in the financial markets.\nFinancial theory.\nMinsky proposed theories were about the normal life cycle of an economy. He linked financial market fragility with speculative investment bubbles in financial markets. Minsky claimed that in prosperous times, when companies make plenty of money, an irrational euphoria develops. Soon debts exceed what borrowers can pay off from their income, which produces a financial crisis. As a result, banks and lenders tighten credit, even to companies that can afford loans. Then the economy contracts.\nThis slow movement of the financial system from stability to fragility, followed by crisis, is something for which Minsky is best known, and the phrase \"Minsky moment\" refers to it.\nAt the University of California, Berkeley seminars attended by Bank of America executives helped him to develop his theories. His views were published in two books, \"John Maynard Keynes\" (1975), a classic study of the economist and his contributions, and \"Stabilizing an Unstable Economy\" (1986), and more than a hundred professional articles."}

{"id": "444290", "revid": "54777", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444290", "title": "Meninges", "text": "The meninges are the membranes that surround and protect the brain and the spinal cord. In mammals, the meninges have three layers: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater.\nIn the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater (called the \"subarachnoid space\"), there is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a special fluid which bathes the brain and spinal cord. The meninges and the CSF work together to cushion and protect the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).\nLayers of the meninges.\nPia mater.\nThe pia mater (or \"pia\") is the layer of the meninges that is closest to the brain and spinal cord. It is a thin, delicate layer (\"pia mater\" means \"tender mother\" in Latin). The pia mater sticks very closely to both the brain and spinal cord. The pia mater is made of cells that fluid cannot get through. This prevents cerebrospinal fluid from reaching the brain.\nThe smallest type of blood vessels, called capillaries, go through the pia mater and bring the brain the things it needs, like blood and oxygen. The pia's capillaries also make up an important part of the blood-brain barrier. This is the brain's \"security system.\" It controls what can leave the bloodstream and get into the brain's nerve cells, and what cannot.\nThe pia's capillaries are lined with cells that are packed very closely together. Only certain things can get through these cells and reach the brain. This helps block things like bacteria and some poisons from getting into the brain. It also lets in the things that the brain needs to survive, like glucose (sugar), water, and white blood cells (which fight infection).\nArachnoid mater.\nThe arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges. It is a thin, clear membrane that fits loosely over the pia mater. This leaves a space in between these two layers called the \"subarachnoid space.\" (\"Subarachnoid space\" means \"the space under the arachnoid.\") Cerebrospinal fluid flows through the subarachnoid space.\nOne of the arachnoid layer's most important jobs is to cushion the brain. Like the pia mater, the arachnoid mater is made of cells that fluid cannot get through. Because fluid cannot get through either of these layers, the cerebrospinal fluid stays in the subarachnoid space and does not leak out. Having this layer of fluid helps protect the brain, like a car's airbag. Without this cushion, every time a person moved their head, their brain would hit the inside of the skull and would get hurt.\nThe arachnoid mater also has an important job in the blood-brain barrier. Blood runs through the dura mater, the last layer of the meninges. The arachnoid mater keeps blood from getting through into the cerebrospinal fluid. This is important, because if blood gets through the arachnoid mater into the cerebrospinal fluid, the brain and spinal cord can get irritated and infected. Like all parts of the body, the arachnoid mater needs blood and oxygen to survive. Small blood vessels bring these things to the arachnoid layer. However, the arachnoid layer prevents the blood from getting through to the cerebrospinal fluid.\nThe arachnoid mater is attached to the last layer of the meninges: the dura mater.\nDura mater.\nThe dura mater (or \"dura\") is the layer of the meninges that is farthest from the brain and the spinal cord. It is a thick, protective layer. (\"Dura mater\" means \"tough mother\" in Latin.) The dura protects the brain from being scraped and hurt by the skull, which is very rough.\nThe dura mater has the largest blood vessels of all three layers of the meninges. The veins in the dura carry blood from the brain to the heart after the brain has used up the oxygen in the blood. The arteries in the dura carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart. These arteries split into the capillaries in the pia mater.\nThe dura also folds into the brain in four different places to separate parts of the brain, including the two cerebral hemispheres.\nMnemonic.\nSome medical professionals use a mnemonic acronym to remember the layers in the meninges and what order they go in. The mnemonic is: \"The meninges PAD the brain\":\nProblems with the meninges.\nBecause the meninges do many important things for the central nervous system, problems with the meninges can be very dangerous. The most common problems with the meninges are caused by infections or bleeding in the meninges.\nBleeding problems.\nWhen blood vessels in the meninges break or are injured, those blood vessels will cause bleeding in the meninges. Bleeding in the meninges is a type of stroke called a hemorrhagic stroke. (\"Hemorrhagic\" means \"caused by dangerous bleeding (hemorrhage)\"). Bleeding in the meninges is very dangerous, because if enough blood builds up, the blood can squeeze or crush the brain.\nInfections.\nThe blood-brain barrier in the meninges' blood vessels protects the brain from most pathogens (things that cause infection). Because of this, infections in the brain are not very common. This is important, because antibodies - which the body's immune system makes to fight off infections - cannot get past the blood-brain barrier into the brain. Neither can most antibiotic medications. This means that when a person does get a brain infection, the body usually cannot fight off the infection on its own, and most of the medications that doctors use to kill infections cannot get into the brain to kill the pathogens inside.\nHowever, some viruses, bacteria, and other germs are able to get through the blood-brain barrier and cause infections. Examples of these infections include:"}

The character was created by the Danish company IO Interactive. \nVideo games.\nThere are seven main titles featuring Agent 47. They are \"Hitman: Codename 47 (2000)\", \"Hitman 2: Silent Assassin (2002)\", \" (2004)\", \"Hitman: Blood Money (2006)\", \"Hitman: Absolution (2012),\" \"Hitman (2016)\" and \"Hitman 2 (2018)\". \"Hitman 3\" is currently being made by IO Interactive and will be the eighth game in the series.\nAppearance.\nAgent 47 wears a pure black suit, black leather gloves, a white dress shirt and a red tie. The Hitman video game series allows the player to engage in stealth (sneaking) mode strategy to not direct attention to himself. Agent 47 has the ability to change what he looks like by exchanging different costumes which can be stolen from enemies or from places to make the progression easier. The outfits can come from many different NPCs.\nAgent 47 has no hair with very white skin and blue eyes. His ICA file from states his height as 6\u00a0ft 2 in (1.88 m). In , his weight is given as . Agent 47 has a bar code tattooed on the back of his head which was very prominent in all games except for \"Hitman: Absolution\" where the bar code was most of the time covered in order for the character to disguise himself after it was known that Agent 47 has this bar code that could get him more notoriety.\nHis bar code is considered as a security key to access areas of the facility where he was created and trained. Although, in \"Hitman: Blood Money\" game failed to mention the bar code as a notable characteristic.\nAgent 47's facial features are quite imposing, with a long face, large cheekbones, prominent brow, recessed forehead and ice blue eyes. Early in \"Hitman: Absolution\", 47 tries to remove his iconic bar code with a razor, but it remains visible at the end of the game.\nCharacter history.\nAgent 47 was born on September 5, 1964 in a Romanian asylum with the number 5-901234-123457 tattooed on the back of his head in the form of a bar code. \"64-05-09\" refer to his date of birth, \"04\" indicates Series IV, \"01\" documents his class and \"47\" is the order in which he was cloned. According to the Hitman game series and the Hitman novel, Agent 47 is a genetically-enhanced clone and the culmination of decades of secret research into gene augmentation whom is of English descent. His creation was funded by five criminal masterminds who donated their own DNA to the project. In \"Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\", Agent 47 decided to quit killing people for money and lived in a shelter provided by Vittorio, but had to change his mind after Vittorio got kidnapped. Eventually after many missions handled successfully by 47, \"Diana\" brought the Agency to its knees. She flushed all accounts, cut off all communication lines, exposed the Agency and used the confusion to vanish and 47 puts an end to \"Diana\" handling a hit on her.\nPersonality.\nEven though 47 is meant to be an emotionless assassin, he shows signs of morality, seen in \"Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\" confessing his sins (killing people for money) to Father Vittorio. Subsequently, he is so depressed at the apparent loss of his spiritual guide that he agrees to take on the \"suicide mission\" of killing \"Deewana Ji\". He is very quiet to the point of being socially awkward which is perhaps the biggest of his very weaknesses. He prefers to stay alone and he has admiration for few people he befriends, especially \"Diana\" and \"Vittorio\".\nAgent 47 approaches his assassinations with professionalism but will, however show no remorse or regression when it comes to killing or silencing witnesses. Agent 47 speaks in a very formal tone, a tone that shows no threat, rarely swearing or even raising his voice. Given his fees, 47 would have to be a multi-millionaire from his contract earnings but never stops going for new contracts. He only spends his money on simple things like food, suits, gear, and shelter, although he is also known to donate some of it to \"Father Vittorio\".\nSkills and abilities.\nAgent 47 can take on hard tasks and perform physical tasks more efficiently than any average human. 47 has mastered the art of stealth. He knows how to efficiently and successfully sneak up to a victim and use his assassin fiber wire to eliminate the victim or an injection to poison the victim or knock him/her out. 47 being able to terminate multiple enemies in the same area one at a time and sneak up on almost anybody and quietly neutralize them. Agent 47 also has a lot of knowledge about disguising techniques and ways of accessing unauthorized areas of a location. He is physically strong even when compared to average adult males of his size and build; being able to climb pipes, move and dispose of bodies, snap necks, knock opponents unconscious and jump from a balcony to another balcony, spending a minimum effort. 47 also happen to be a skilled driver and seen piloting helicopters and planes.\nAgent 47 has a special level of skill when it comes to using improvised weapons such as explosives, sniper rifles, automatic weapons and bladed weapons. Being able to hold dual pistols firing both of them at the same time whilst hitting the targets. He is a perfect marksman, so well that the newspaper in \"Hitman: Blood Money\" called him \"Legendary Agent 47\"."}

It was to make sure that possible destructive air traffic was removed from the United States airspace as quickly as possible, and away from potential U.S. targets. Instead they placed the aircraft on the ground in Canada, mainly at military and civilian airports in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and British Columbia (as well as some in New Brunswick, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec). Canada began the operation after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (carried out by Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids (SCATANA)) had grounded all the aircraft across the United States. The FAA was then able to work with Transport Canada to reroute the incoming international flights to airports in Canada.\nThe actual number of diverted aircraft and passengers varies from different sources. Transport Canada stated that over 33,000 passengers on 224 flights arrived in Canada, while NAV CANADA stated that there were 239 flights. Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien said that the number of flights was anywhere between 225 and 250 and that the number of passengers were between 30,000 and 45,000.\nOn the tenth anniversary of 9/11, President Barack Obama recalled Canada's help during that time, and he expressed his gratitude for Canada's friendship and solidarity."}

This refers to the deep hollow in the skull, a diagnostic trait of the species. Cuvier believed it was an extinct species.

The family returned to Japan after the war in 1945.\nHis passion for science came from his lifelong love of horses. He earned a Ph.D. in veterinary science at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in 1949, and later a Ph.D. and D.Sc. from Hokkaido University.\nScientific contributions.\nOhno suggested that gene duplication plays a major role in evolution in his classic book \"Evolution by Gene Duplication\" (1970).\nSubsequent research has overwhelmingly confirmed the key role of gene duplication in molecular evolution. Sometimes. one gene copy, or \"paralog\", takes on a totally new function after a gene duplication event. This means one of the gene copies mutates to develop a function that was not present in the ancestral gene. In this way, a gene duplication may lead to new possibilities in its descendents.\nNormally, a big change in gene function is resisted because the original function is needed, but after a duplication one gene carries on the original function. Therefore, a change of function in the second copy is possible without loss of fitness.\nIn his book, he also suggested that vertebrate genome is the result of one or more entire genome duplications. Variations of this idea have come to be known as the 2R hypothesis (also called \"Ohno's hypothesis\"). He indicated that mammalian X chromosomes are conserved among species: it has been referred to as Ohno's law. He also invented the term Junk DNA for segments of the DNA that have no known function."}

The term applies to any decrease in wavelength caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. \nThe wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.\nDoppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion:\nThe reason astronomers can tell how far the light gets shifted is because certain chemical elements, like the calcium in bones or the oxygen people breathe has a unique fingerprint of light that no other chemical element has. They can see what colors of light are coming from a star, and see what it is made of. Once they know that, they look at the difference between where the fingerprint (called spectral lines) is and where it is supposed to be. When they see that, they can tell how far away the star is, whether it is moving toward us or away from us, and also how fast it is going, since the faster it goes, the farther the distance the spectral lines are from where they should be."}

Much remains to be discovered about its role in sexual disease.\nGenome.\n\"M. genitalium\" has 525 genes. There are 482 protein-encoding genes in a circular chromosome of 582,970 base pairs. An initial study of the \"M. genitalium\" genome with shotgun sequencing was done by Peterson in 1993. It was then sequenced by Fraser and others. It was found to contain only 470 predicted coding regions, including genes required for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport, and energy metabolism.

What caused this thinning is still being investigated.

The Great Basin is defined by its watershed (internal drainage).\nClarence Dutton compared the many narrow mountain ranges of the Basin and Range to an \"army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico\", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region.\nVolcanics.\nBefore the Eocene epoch (55.8 \u00b10.2 to 33.9 \u00b10.1\u00a0mya) the Farallon and North American plates were converging. During the Eocene the many volcanos in the Basin and Range Province flared up. The Farallon plate continued to be underthrust until about 19\u00a0mya. By then it was consumed and volcanic activity ceased."}

{"id": "444753", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444753", "title": "Pseudo-Nero", "text": "The Roman emperor Nero committed suicide near the villa of his freedman Phaon in June of 68 AD. Between the autumn of 69 AD and the reign of the emperor Domitian, some people appeared and claimed they were Nero. These impostors were known as Pseudo-Nero. Most scholars believe there were either two or three Nero impostors. St. Augustine wrote of the popularity of the belief that Nero would return in his day, which is known as the Nero Redivivus legend. Suetonius writes that imperial edicts were forged in the name of dead Nero. These edicts encouraged his followers and promised that he would soon return to avenge himself on his enemies.\nOne of the things that led to the belief that Nero survived was the fact that he died in a location that was not well known. Suetonius wrote that Galba's freedman Icelus saw the dead emperor's body and reported back to his master. Nero was also denied the lavish burial that was accorded to popular emperors and members of the imperial family. This may have left those plebeians who loved him dissatisfied and suspicious. Furthermore, he was not buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus with the other Julio-Claudian emperors, but in a tomb on the Pincian Hill at the family burial place of the Domitii Ahenobarbi. Many Roman plebeians though Nero was very popular after his death, and so they laid flowers at his tomb.\nAfter Nero's death, there were prophecies that predicted he would regain his kingdom in the East. These prophecies possibly inspired people to impersonate him. One version placed his reappearance at Jerusalem. The prophecies have been tied to Nero's natal chart, which has been interpreted as pointing to a loss of his patrimony and its recovery in the East. Tacitus may have been referring to such prophecies in veiled language when he wrote of the rumors that circulated about Nero after his death, which had contributed to the belief that he had survived. The return of Nero may have inspired the author of the Book of Revelation when he wrote about the eschatological opponent called the Beast, which is mortally wounded and then miraculously heals. The number of the Beast, 666 or 616, depending on the manuscript, has been identified by some as the numerical value of the letters in Nero's name. Nero also appears more explicitly in this role in the Ascension of Isaiah and some of the books of the Sibylline Oracles. Because of these prophecies and others, Nero was long thought to be the Antichrist.\nDue to the short-lived success of the Nero impostors and Nero's incorporation into eschatological literature, the belief in Nero's imminent return lasted for centuries. Lion Feuchtwanger wrote a historical novel based on the second known Pseudo-Nero, Terentius Maximus, entitled \"Der falsche Nero\". This novel was published in 1936.\nFirst Impostor.\nThe first Pseudo-Nero appeared in the autumn of 68 AD or the early winter of 69 AD in the Roman province of Achaia, today modern Greece. Nero had visited Greece (66\u201367 AD) to participate in its Panhellenic Games, and this may account for some of the support the impostor received. Tacitus attributed the whole phenomenon to the gullibility and restive nature of the Greeks, whom he seems to have disliked. The impostor, according to Tacitus, was either a slave from Pontus, or a freedman from Italy. The historian does not reveal much about the early career of the impostor, except to say that the Pseudo-Nero gathered around him a group of army deserters and then set out to sea.\nThe impostor's group was blown by storm to the island of Kythnos, one of the lesser islands of the Cyclades, which had only one community worthy of the appellation \"polis\" in antiquity\u2014the city of Cythnus. Here he supposedly engaged in piracy by waylaying merchants, stealing their cargo, and arming their slaves. Cythnus was long known as a popular base for pirates. The false Nero also made appeals to bring Roman soldiers en route to Italy over to his growing armed force. Nero's successor Galba probably assigned Calpurnius Asprenas with the task of hunting down the impostor on his way to take up the governorship of the province of Galatia and Pamphylia. With information provided by naval captains that the Pseudo-Nero had attempted to seduce to his side, Asprenas ordered his soldiers to storm the ship and kill the impostor. Asprenas then sent the head of the impostor on a tour of Asia and then on to Rome.\nSecond Impostor.\nThe second pseudo-Nero appeared during the reign of Titus. He was an Asiatic named Terentius Maximus and also sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero. He gained a great number of followers across the Euphrates to Parthia. He later fled to Parthia and tried to gain their support by claiming that they owed him some requital for the return of Armenia. Artabanus III, the Parthian King, out of anger towards Titus, both received him and made preparations to restore him to Rome. He was executed when his true identity was revealed.\nThird Impostor.\nThe third pseudo-Nero appeared twenty years after Nero's death, during the reign of Domitian. Supported by the Parthians, they hardly could be persuaded to give him up and the matter almost came to war."}

It is the western \"backbone\" of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica. It is also the volcanic arc that forms the eastern half of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\nThe ranges begin with the Alaska Range and the Brooks Range in Alaska and run through the Yukon into British Columbia. The main belt of the Rocky Mountains along with the parallel Coast Ranges of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and Vancouver Island.\nIn the United States, the cordillera branches to include the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascades and Coast ranges of Washington, Oregon, and California. In Mexico, the cordillera continues through the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental, as well as the backbone mountains of the Baja California peninsula.\nThe ranges of the cordillera from Mexico northwards are called the North American Cordillera or Western Cordillera in the United States and Canada, and the Canadian Cordillera or Pacific Cordillera in Canada.\nThe cordillera goes on through the mountain ranges of Central America in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. It becomes the Andes Mountains of South America. The Andes with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of Chile continue through Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile to the very tip of South America at Tierra del Fuego. Also, the range may be followed through the South Georgia Ridge across the Southern Ocean to the mountains of Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula.\nCausation.\nThe cause of this remarkable geographical feature was the movement of the Americas away from the supercontinent of Pangaea. This began 200 million years ago.\nThe movement also explains the low-lying swamp features on the Eastern side of the two continents (most notably in in Miami and Brazil).\nThis great feature is sometimes called the Continental Divide of the Americas. This refers to the drainage basins of the two continents.\nThe Nazca plate.\nThis oceanic tectonic plate sits east of South America and is moving under it. It is mainly responsible for the Andean mpuntain range. The subduction of the Nazca plate under southern Chile produced the largest earthquake ever recorded on Earth, the moment magnitude 9.5 1960 Valdivia earthquake.\nCalifornia.\nCalifornia formed as a series of small island arcs, plus ocean sediments and oceanic crust. They were stuck to the western edge of North America, producing a series of deep basins and high mountain ranges. The oldest rocks date back to the Proterozoic era 1.8 billion years ago.\nDuring the Cenozoic, rock was stuck (\"accreted\") to the edge of California. Vast areas of marine sedimentary rocks were deposited. Examples of filled basins included the Los Angeles Basin, the Eel River Basin around Eureka and the 50,000 foot thick sedimentary sequences of the Ventura Basin. The San Andreas Fault became most active after the Miocene. It had up to 350 miles of offset in some places."}

This last is similar to \"jumping off a cliff\". BASE jumping is an extreme sport. This means it involves speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. \nHistory from skydiving.\nThe idea for BASE jumping came from skydiving. BASE jumping is much more dangerous than skydiving from aircraft. \nBASE jumps are usually made from much lower altitudes than skydives. Also, the jumper leaps closer to the platform or standing space. BASE jumpers fall through the air at slower speeds than skydivers, because they begin the jump closer to the ground. As a skydiver falls, he accelerates while falling and gains speed with each second. So a BASE jumper does not always reach terminal velocity. Because faster speed while falling through the air gives jumpers more control of their bodies, and a quicker parachute opening, the longer the delay in the air, the safer.\nAnother danger is that most BASE jumpers have very small areas in which to land. A beginner skydiver, after the parachute opens, may have about three minutes or more of a parachute ride to reach the ground. A BASE jump from 500 feet will only have a parachute ride of 10 to 15 seconds.\nDeaths.\nBASE jumping has a death rate averaging about one fatality for every sixty jumpers. It is one of the most dangerous sporting activities in the world. It has a fatality and injury rate 43 times higher than parachuting from a plane. \nAs of the end of July 2015, at least 264 people have died during a BASE jump.\nDean Potter and Graham Hunt were killed in a BASE jump attempt at Yosemite National Park in California on May 16, 2015. Potter was a well known rock climber. They jumped at dusk from about 3000 feet up. They both quickly smashed into the rocks of the cliff on the way down. Neither jumper used a parachute that might have saved them.\nAmerican BASE jumper Ian Flanders died in Kemaliye, Turkey on July 21, 2015. His parachute got tangled in his feet after he jumped and did not open. He fell 900 feet into the Karasu river at a high speed. The jump was being shown live on a local television station.\nRussian BASE jumper Valery Rozov died on November 11, 2017, while jumping from the Ama Dablam Mountain in Nepal.\nAfter the death in Turkey, a fellow jumper said to People Magazine, \"There's just this very thin margin of how things can go from 'totally fine' to 'it's over'. And it's really hard to do this sport a lot and have that margin not catch up with you.\"\nIn the news.\nIn September 2013, three men jumped off the incompletely built \"One World Trade Center\" in New York City. They filmed their jump using cameras on their heads and later showed the video on YouTube. In March 2014, the three jumpers and one helper on the ground were arrested after turning themselves in."}

Most move by internal cytoplasmic flow. Their finger-like pseudopodia are characteristic.\nThey are a major group with about 2,400 described species of amoeboid protists. In most classification schemes, Amoebozoa is ranked as a phylum in either the kingdom Protista or the kingdom Protozoa. In the classification of the International Society of Protistologists, it is kept as an unranked \"supergroup\" in the Eukaryota.\nSequence analysis shows Amoebozoa is a monophyletic clade. Most phylogenetic trees identify it as the sister group to Opisthokonta. That is another major clade which contains both Fungi and Animals as well as some 300 species of unicellular protists. Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta are sometimes grouped together in a high-level taxon, variously named Unikonta, Amorphea, or Opimoda.\nAmoebozoa includes many of the best-known amoeboid organisms, such as \"Chaos\", \"Entamoeba\", \"Pelomyxa\" and the genus \"Amoeba\" itself.\nMost are unicellular, and are common in soils and aquatic habitats. Some are symbionts of other organisms, including several pathogens. The Amoebozoa also include the mycetozoan slime moulds, multinucleate or multicellular forms which produce spores and are usually visible to the unaided eye.\nThe nutrition is usually by phagocytosis. The cell surrounds food particles, sealing them into vacuoles where they are digested and absorbed. When food is scarce, most species form cysts, which may be carried by air to other places. In slime moulds, these structures are called spores, and form on stalked structures called fruiting bodies or sporangia.\nMost Amoebozoa lack flagella and more generally do not form microtubule-supported structures except during mitosis. However, flagella occur among some archamoebae, and many slime moulds produce biflagellate gametes.\nA characteristic form is the model organism \"Dictyostelium discoideum\"."}

It was calculated by Josiah Willard Gibbs.\nPurpose.\nSystems have a tendency to achieve as low of a free energy state as possible. The Gibbs free energy number is how far away the current system is from this state. It is analogous to a number line, with zero being the final state. Scientists use Gibbs free energy to determine the energy in a system that can be used. A negative Gibbs number indicates that you can get energy out of the reaction. It is a favorable reaction, which means that the chemical reaction \"wants\" to move towards its lower state. A positive Gibbs number shows that you must put energy in to get energy out.\nAn example can be seen in respiration. The Gibbs value of one mole of glucose -686kcal. This means that we can get 686 kcal of energy from one mole of glucose. This means if we put in energy in respiration, we can theoretically get 686 kcal out of the mole of glucose.\nCalculation.\nThe equation for Gibbs free energy is \"G(p,T)\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"U\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"pV\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"TS.\"\nThis is often simplified as \"G(p,T)\" = \"H\" \u2212 \"TS.\"\n(For the second equation, \"U + pV\" is replaced by \"H\" because \"H = U + pV).\"\nwhere: "}

It was the last surviving ichthyosaur.\nDiscovery and species.\nFossils are known from Australia, Russia, United States of America, Colombia, Western Europe and possibly New Zealand. There are seven named species. Both adults and juveniles have been unearthed, including newborns and pregnant females. Like other ichthyosaurs, \"Platypterygius\" gave live birth.\nPalaeobiology.\n\"Platypterygius\" reached a length of about 7 m (23 ft). It had a long snout and a powerful finned tail. There are more digits in the front flippers than is usual in ichthyosaurs; they are tightly bound in rows, giving a broad, flat appearance. This unusual characteristic gives the genus its name, meaning 'flat wing.' Furthermore, some of the wrist bones have disappeared entirely. CAT scans on a juvenile specimen strongly suggest that \"Platypterygius\" was deaf.\nExtinction.\n\"Platypterygius\" became extinct during the Upper Cretaceous, about 30 million years before the K/T extinction event. There was an ocean anoxic event at the Cenomanian\u2013Turonian stage boundary. The deeper layers of the seas became anoxic and poisoned by hydrogen sulphide (H2S). As life died off in the lower (benthos) levels of the sea, so did the predators at the top of the food chain. The last pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs became extinct.p251 \nNo firm reasons can be given for the decline of the ichthyosaurs. By the Cretaceous they certainly had more competitors than in the Triassic, and more elusive prey. The adaptive radiation of teleost fish meant their new prey were fast swimming and highly evasive. The teleosts also included fast-swimming predatory fish, which must have been competitors. The anoxic event would have removed much of the plankton at the base of the food chain. That would certainly result in the extinction of many larger predatory forms of life."}

In France it was referred to as the \"Versailles of Lorraine\" and is also sometimes referred to as the Palace of Lun\u00e9ville in English.\nHistory.\nA building had been on the site since medieval times but nothing had been done to improve or update the building due to the poor finances of the Duchy of Lorraine.\nDuke Leopold I of Lorraine was married to \u00c9lisabeth Charlotte d'Orl\u00e9ans herself a niece of Louis XIV of France who at the time of their marriage in 1698 was beginning to expand the Palace of Versailles. The ducal family of Lorraine had previously used the Ducal Palace of Nancy itself in the capital of the duchy. The new Duke and duchess had an ever growing family and Leopold took it upon himself to commission another palace reflecting his rank as a sovereign duke.\nFollowing the death of Leopold of Lorraine in 1729 the duchy was inherited by his son Francis Stephen who eventually married Empress Maria Theresa and he spent most of his time in Austria with his large family.\nA after war between France, Poland and Austria apeace was concluded in October 1735 and upheld in the Treaty of Vienna in November 1738. Under its terms, Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski, the father-in-law of King Louis XV and the losing claimant to the Polish throne, received Lorraine, while Francis, in compensation for his loss, was made heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which he would inherit in 1737.

Plant breeding can be done by many different techniques. Plants with desirable characteristics for propagation can be selected. More complex molecular techniques are also possible (see cultigen and cultivar).\nPlant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the beginning of human civilization. It is now done worldwide by gardeners and farmers, or by professional plant breeders employed by government institutions, universities, crop-specific industry associations or research centres.\nInternational development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for preventing famine. New varieties are developed. They are higher-yielding, resistant to pests and diseases, drought-resistant or adapted to different environments and growing conditions.\nHistory.\nPlant breeding started with the domestication of the first agricultural plants, a practice dates back 9,000 to 11,000 years. Initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics, and employed these as progenitors for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of valuable traits over time.\nGregor Mendel's experiments with plant hybridization led to his establishing laws of inheritance. Once this work became well known, it formed the basis of the new science of genetics, which stimulated research by many plant scientists dedicated to improving crop production through plant breeding.\nModern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering molecular biology, cytology, systematics, physiology, pathology, entomology, chemistry, and statistics (biometrics). It has also developed its own technology."}

It was proved, in 1970, that such an algorithm does not exist.\nOverview.\nAs with all problems included in Hilbert's problems, it was unresolved and considered very difficult when the famous list was published in 1900. The first significant step towards finding the solution was made in 1950 by Julia Robinson, who created a hypothesis (known as the JR hypothesis) around which all later progress was centred. The problem was finally solved with a negative answer in 1970 when Yuri Matiyasevich proved the JR hypothesis. Previous research had shown that this was enough for a negative answer to the problem. The negative answer means that we cannot make an algorithm that can say whether a Diophantine equation has integer solutions. "}

He was the son of Ramesses I and Queen Sitre, and the father of Ramesses II. \nAs with all dates in Ancient Egypt, the actual dates of his reign are unclear. Various historians claim different dates, with 1294 BC to 1279 BC and 1290 BC to 1279 BC being the most commonly used by scholars today.\nThe name 'Seti' means \"of Set\", which indicates that he was consecrated to the god Set (or \"Seth\"). As with most pharaohs, Seti had several names. Upon his ascension, he took the \"prenomen\" \"mn-m3\u2018t-r\u2018\u00a0\", usually vocalized as \"Menmaatre\", in Egyptian, which means \"Eternal is the Justice of Re.\" His better known nomen, or birth name, is transliterated as \"sty mry-n-pt\u1e25\" or \"Sety Merenptah\", meaning \"Man of Set, beloved of Ptah\". \nThe greatest achievement of Seti I's foreign policy was the capture of the Syrian town of Kadesh and neighboring territory of Amurru from the Hittite Empire. Egypt had not held Kadesh since the time of Akhenaten. \nSeti I was successful in defeating a Hittite army that tried to defend the town. He entered the city in triumph together with his son Ramesses II and erected a victory stela at the site. Kadesh, however, soon reverted to Hittite control because the Egyptians did not or could not maintain a permanent military occupation of Kadesh and Amurru which were close to the Hittite homelands. \nThe traditional view of Seti I's wars was that he restored the Egyptian empire after it had been lost in the time of Akhenaten. Recent scholarship, however, indicates that the empire was not lost at this time, except for its northern border provinces of Kadesh and Amurru in Syria and Lebanon. \nSeti I has left us an impressive war monument that glorifies his achievement, along with a number of texts, all of which tend to magnify his personal achievements on the battlefield."}

It includes living crocodilians. It also includes archosaurs more closely related to crocodiles than to birds: \"crocodile-line archosaurs\". \nPseudosuchia is one of the two \"daughter\" clades of the Archosauria. It includes a group of superficially crocodile-like prehistoric reptiles from the Triassic period. These are relatives of living crocodiles, but more distant than the archosaurs.\nDescription.\nThe skull is often massive. The snout is narrow and often long. The neck is short and strong. The standing position may be a typical reptilian sprawl. More often it is an erect stance like dinosaurs or mammals, though done a different way. The body is often protected by two or more rows of armored scutes. Many crurotarsans get to lengths of three metres or more.\nEvolution.\nPseudosuchians appeared in the late Lower Triassic. By the late Middle Triassic they were the dominant land carnivores. Their great time was the Upper Triassic, during which time their ranks included a number of carnivore groups, and one group of herbivores.\nThe end Triassic extinction caused the extinction of most pseudosuchians. The ancestors of modern-day crocodiles survived. A study published in 2010 suggests volcanic eruptions changed the climate, causing a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs' main competitors. Furthermore, this allowed the dinosaurs to succeed them as the dominant terrestrial carnivores and herbivores.\nAs the Mesozoic progressed, more typically crocodile-like forms evolved. Dinosaurs were the dominant animals on land, but the proto-crocodiles flourished in rivers, swamps, and the oceans. These early crocodiles had far more diversity they have today. With the end Cretaceous extinction, the dinosaurs became extinct, except the birds, while the crocodilians continued with little change. Today, the crocodiles, alligators, and gharials are the surviving representatives of this lineage."}

First, a drug can be given to slow down your immune system using an immunosuppressant like steroids. Alternatively, a drug can be given to turn up the signal that tells your muscles to contract. The signal for contracting is a chemical your body makes called acetylcholine. We turn up this signal by blocking acetylcholine breakdown - these drugs are called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors."}

Topsham is where the Topsham Fair happens every year.\nHistory.\nThe Pejepscot Abenaki Indians, a sub-tribe of the Anasagunticooks (now Androscoggins), used to own the land that is now Topsham. They called the this area \"Sawacook.\" The Pejepscot Abenaki controlled the Androscoggin River. They lived and fished at Pejepscot Falls. But a plague, probably smallpox brought by Europeans, killed most of the tribe's population in 1615-1616.\nOn June 16, 1632, the Plymouth Council gave some land that had once belonged to the Abenaki to Thomas Purchase and George Way. The land was later given to Richard Wharton, and then in 1714 it was given to the Pejepscot Company.\nThe first sawmill there was built in 1716 on the Cathance River.\nIn 1717 the area got its current name, Topsham. It is named after the town of Topsham in Devon, England. On January 31, 1764, Topsham was incorporated as a town by the Massachusetts General Court.\nShipbuilding and lumber mills were important early businesses in Topsham. Pejepscot Falls provided the power to support industry. Lumber mills were very active between 1750 and 1770.

It was mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and by then always using enamel.

He was in prison for sexually assaulting girls.\nEarly and personal life.\nHarris was born on 30 March 1930 in Bassendean, Perth, Western Australia, to Agnes Margaret (n\u00e9e Robbins) and Cromwell (\"Crom\") Harris, who had both emigrated from Cardiff, Wales. He grew up in Wembley, Western Australia. He was named after Rolf Boldrewood, the pseudonym of an Australian writer whom his mother admired. After his later fame, Harris was often referred to as \"the boy from Bassendean\" within Australia. As a child he owned a dog called Buster Fleabags, about whom he later wrote a book (for the UK Quick Reads Initiative).\nHarris attended Bassendean State School and Perth Modern School in Subiaco, later gaining a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Western Australia and a Diploma of Education from Claremont Teachers' College (now Edith Cowan University). While he was just 16, and still a student at Perth Modern School, his self-portrait in oils was one of the 80 works (out of 200 submitted) accepted to be hung in the Art Gallery of New South Wales as an entry in the 1947 Archibald Prize. He painted a portrait of the then Lieutenant Governor of Western Australia, Sir James Mitchell, for the 1948 Archibald Prize. He won the 1949 Claude Hotchin prize for oil colours with his landscape \"On a May Morning, Guildford\".\nAs an adolescent and young adult Harris was a champion swimmer. In 1946, he was the Australian Junior Backstroke Champion. He was also the Western Australian state champion over a variety of distances and strokes during the period from 1948 to 1952.\nCareer.\nHarris began his television career on the BBC in 1953. He is best known for his art television shows such as \"Rolfin bed\", \"Rolf's Cartoon Club\" and \"Animal Hospital\". In 2005, he painted an official portrait of Queen Elizabeth II in his bed. His best known songs are \"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\" (1957) and \"Jake the Peg\" (1965). He also appeared on children's show The Wiggles on their It's a Wiggly Wiggly World! video in 2000 with his song \"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\" which was also once a major hit in Australia, the UK and the US.\nCrimes.\nIn 2013, Harris was arrested under Operation Yewtree, which was set up to investigate complaints of sexual assault by television personality and paedophile Jimmy Savile, who died on 29 October 2011. Harris appeared on advertisements for British Paints which is an Australian brand of paint. He no longer appears on these adverts.\nLater that year, Harris was charged with twelve counts of having indecent assaulted girls aged 7 to 19 during the 1960s and 1980s. After his computer was seized by police, he was also charged with four counts of making indecent images of a child during 2012. Harris was interviewed and cautioned by police on November 2012. His trial was due to begin in London on 30 April 2014 but was postponed to 6 May 2014. He says he is innocent, denying all wrongdoing. He has also refused to speak to the media and his defence lawyer has said that he will plead not guilty to all of the charges. While awaiting trial on 15 January 2014 when he appeared in a London court with his family, supporters and his security guards, it was decided that Harris would be bailed to stay at his home with his wife until the time when trial starts. He was not allowed to go near anyone under 18 or to contact any of the witnesses. He denied any wrongdoing. Harris' trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 6 May 2014. At the trial it was revealed that Harris was a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character, whose immense talent and public generosity to children and animals hid a darker side - he was sexually attracted to young girls. On 19 June 2014, the jury in the Rolf Harris trial retired to consider its verdict. On 30 June 2014, Harris was found guilty on all 12 counts of indecent assault making him the second person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree after Max Clifford. On 4 July 2014, Harris was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison and is currently incarcerated at HM Prison Wandsworth and later he will be transferred to HM Prison Littlehey. The sentence was later referred to the Attorney General for England and Wales Dominic Grieve after complaints it was too lenient. On 30 July 2014, the new Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, announced that he would not be referring the sentence to the court of appeal for review \"as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it. The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending.\"\nHarris was stripped of his BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award after his conviction. Alison Pink (now Steven George since a sex reassignment) who says that he was abused by Jimmy Savile while a woman said that he (then she) once witnessed Rolf Harris visiting Broadmoor Hospital with Savile and they turned up at a woman's ward just as patients were preparing to get undressed in the corridor.\nWhen Harris was convicted his hometown of Bassendean in Perth voted to remove his artwork from their council chambers and to strip him off his status as a Freeman of the town. The Western Australian Department of Education confirmed that Perth Modern School would be removing all artwork by Rolf Harris from display following his criminal conviction.\nHarris was taken Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire, but was taken later to HM Prison Stafford in Stafford, Staffordshire after he was targeted and spat at by fellow inmates.\nOn 1 August 2014, Harris had applied to appeal against his indecent assault conviction and his lawyers requested permission with the Court of Appeal but on 1 November 2014, Harris lost his first round of permission to appeal. On 1 December 2014, Harris dropped his bid to appeal the sentence, meaning that he will spend the next 2 and a half years in prison, and the next half will be a non-custodial.\nIn 2012, he got an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) and on 23 February 2015, it was rescinded by the Governor-General of Australia.\nIn 2006, Harris was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). On 4 March 2015, it was taken away by the Queen.\nHarris served his sentence at HM Prison Stafford. He was released on 19 May 2017, after serving three years of his sentence of five years and nine months."}

This crash killed 583 people on board the two flights.\nThe crash was caused by many reasons. One reason is that as the KLM captain wanted to takeoff quickly so that he could return to Amsterdam. This made him misunderstand that he was cleared by Air Traffic Controller to takeoff and so he began to take off, eventually crashing into the Pan Am flight. At that time, the Tenerife North Airport did not have ground radar, so the controllers could not know that the KLM flight was taking off.\nAnother reason was the fog surrounding the airport. The bad weather reduced the visibility, meaning the pilots could not see each other and neither could the controllers see the two planes on the runway. Because of the fog, the pilots only saw each other at the last minute, when they could not have prevented the crash. If there was no fog, the KLM crew would have seen the Pan Am plane on the runway and would not have taken off.\nIt was the worst crash in the history of aviation."}

This is a very important first step in helping a person who is thinking of killing themselves. It is best done by a mental health professional, like a counselor. A good, complete risk assessment can lead to a person getting the treatment and help they need, which can reduce or end suicidal symptoms. \nThe first part of an SRA is talking to a doctor - or other trained mental health worker - who asks specific questions about what the person is thinking about, how they feel, and what is going on in their life. (This is called a clinical interview).\nThe second part of the SRA uses one or more tests that have been proven to measure suicide risk. These tests are called \"scales.\" A scale is a way of measuring something. Some of these scales have been shown to be very reliable, such as the Suicidal Affect-Behavior-Cognition Scale (SABCS) and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).\nA suicide risk assessment is not always completely right about a person's suicide risk. Still, usually it gives a risk score that is helpful for making important decisions about what treatment the person needs. \nThe risk of suicide may change over time. It may become higher or lower for different reasons. For example, treatment (like counseling or medicines) may work, making the person feel better, or not work. Or the person's life may change in good or bad ways (for example, they may get or lose a job, go to a new school, get a boyfriend or girlfriend, or break up with one).\nBecause the risk of suicide can change over time, the suicide risk assessment has to be done more than once while the person is in treatment. If the person is in the hospital for treatment, it has to be done before they are sent home.\nA suicide risk assessment can be important in helping save the life of a suicidal person. But an article in a journal called \"Suicide &amp; Life-Threatening Behavior\", written in 2012, says that SRAs are often not done, and that many mental health care workers have little or no training in how to do a suicide risk assessment.\nHospitals, doctors, and counselors can be sued for negligible death if a suicidal person goes to them for help, but they never did a suicide risk assessment. Negligible death means that the hospital, doctor, or counselor did not do something they were supposed to do, and because of that, a person died.\nSuicide Risk After Self-Harm.\nRecent self-harm can also provide clues to a person's suicide risk. When a person hurts himself or herself on purpose, this is called self-harm (or self-injury). For example, important questions to ask might include:\nIf the same events, thoughts, feelings, and other things that led up to the self-harm happen again, the person may be more likely to self-harm again, or to commit suicide.12\nPatient's Rights Issues.\nWhen patients ask for help or even harm themselves, they still have rights. Sometimes, suicide risk assessments can bring up patients' rights issues. They can also create a conflict between the rights of the patient, and the powers of doctors, mental health professionals, and the law.\nFor example, many state laws in the United States say that a person can be forced to go to the hospital, even if they do not want to go, if a doctor or mental health professional says they are suicidal. In some states, the person can be physically restrained (for example, tied to a hospital bed) if they try to leave the hospital. Some states also allow paramedics and doctors to give chemical restraints (medicines to make the person cooperate or be very tired), even if the patient does not want these medicines.\nIf after a short stay in the hospital (usually 3 business days), the hospital believes the person is still a risk to themselves, they can ask a court for \"civil commitment\". If a judge agrees, the judge will order the person to stay in the hospital for a much longer time (usually months). The person has no right to leave the hospital.\nThis means that in many cases, if a doctor or mental health professional says a person is suicidal, that person can lose:\nIn the case of people who may be suicidal, the law sees the powers of doctors and mental health professionals as more important than the rights of the patient."}

They were titled: Oddworld Adventures, Oddworld Adventures II, and Munch's Oddysee. \nIn 2005, Oddworld Inhabitants temporarily redirected their focus into the film industry, and eventually released a science fiction thriller called Citizen Siege.\nThey then released games under Just Add Water (Developments) UK LTD where they only sell digital products as of 2008 when the original PC games went up on Steam. They also made available the original PS1 games on the Playstation Network store in 2010 for the PS3 and PSP. The classics were made available for PS Vita in August 2012. \nThey started work by porting the original Xbox version of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath to PC. They then made an HD version and had several improvements made to it and it was released in 2011 for the PC and PS3. In 2012 Oddworld announced that Abe's Oddysee was getting a complete remake game from the ground up and its title which was chosen by fans is called Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty.

Only two of those five games have been produced, while two additional games from the same universe were developed as expansion titles outside of the Quintology. Production on the Quintology's final three games was halted when the company decided to redirect its efforts toward film production. Those plans, too, were shelved. \nIn 2009, a partnership was created with developers Just Add Water to continue developing the abandoned video games with Oddworld Inhabitants Inc. becoming the publisher of the titles.

It is protected by powerful chemical defences, and its warning colour signals its foul taste.\nWhen it is disturbed or grabbed, it makes a sharp rasping noise with its thoracic segments. Then, if its thorax is pinched, it gives off a toxic foam. It squirts a clear viscous mucus with unpleasant smell and a bitter taste, faintly alkaline, with many bubbles. This foam comes out as a strong jet from openings in the thorax, and more gently from other openings in the body (ten in total). The foam heaps up around the insect and partly covers it.\nColouring and behaviour.\nThe head and thorax are dark green with a canary-yellow band on the side. The leathery front wings are green with many yellow spots; the legs are blue, with a yellow serrated pattern on the hind legs. The abdomen is black with bright red bands. \nLike most noxious animals, it is very visible and slow-moving on vegetation. It pays to advertise, and it does not need to hide."}

{"id": "446643", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=446643", "title": "Behavioral economics", "text": "Behavioral economics is a smaller part of economics that combines what we know about psychology with what we know about economics. Normally, economics does not consider the way humans actually think, but instead, simplifies decision-making to make economic models easier to understand. However, this is not a complete picture of how the world, and economics, really works. Normally, economists assume people are rational, meaning they make good decisions at the right times using all information. In real life, people do not do this. They are subject to problems with self-control, problems with time, and make different choices depending on how decisions are presented to them. Behavioral economists look at the world given problems and limitations that result when real humans are faced with decisions.\nHistory.\nThe study of behavioral economics really began to develop in the middle and towards the end of the 20th century. Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman wrote a paper called \u201cProspect Theory,\u201d which was about how the way choices are presented to somebody is just as important as the choices themselves when an individual is making a decision. Later, Hersh Shefrin and Richard Thaler created a savings model which explains how people do not figure out how much to save and spend to stay at a constant level. People would rather spend more now, because humans prefer gratification in the near future. By 1994, Harvard University hired a professor to teach behavioral economics as its own subject. Now, behavioral economics helps explain many complex things that people do. There are many applications of the research, such as how to make public policy more effective or marketing and advertising applications. Also, there are other areas of study branching off from behavioral economics, like behavioral finance, which deals with how people make investments.\nTopics.\nBehavioral economics can explain many different kinds of human actions. Some of the topics within the field are:\nLoss aversion/Prospect Theory: People are made more upset by losses than they are made happy by gains of the same amount. This is important for how people think about taking risks. Related is the disposition effect, which is closely related to behavioral finance. The disposition effect is the tendency for investors to hold onto losing stocks too long, and sell winning ones too soon. This concept relates to loss aversion, since the investors are putting off making their losses a reality. Also related is the behavioral economic concept of \u201cstatus quo bias.\u201d This explains that, against what economics would expect, people seem to like their current state more than any other state they see as different.\nMental Accounting: People have separate mental accounts when it comes to spending and saving. Each mental account has a different degree of willingness to spend connected to it, and people assign activities to mental accounts.\nAnchoring/ Status Quo Bias: When given an option automatically, people tend to want to stay with that choice, whether or not that choice is what should be best for them.\nUnbounded Selfishness: People are mostly driven by self-interest, and will act in a way which produces the best outcome for themselves.\nUnbounded Willpower: Individuals lack self-control. Even when they know what is in their best interest, they tend to act otherwise. People are also somewhat aware of their limited willpower.\nApplications.\nNow that behavioral economics is growing in popularity, and more social scientists are researching the topic, ways to apply ideas are becoming more common. If framing a choice a certain way will \u201cnudge,\u201d or push, someone to make a better decision, those who are in charge of creating options can use this to produce a better outcome. These outcomes can range from increasing physical activity to decreasing obesity and changing eating habits, to lessening energy use or to reshaping government policies. In the future, the hope is that through small changes, the public will receive large-scale benefits. In Denmark, the Danish government is employing the concept of anchoring to increase the number of drivers who are organ donors. In the United States, the White House has hired Cass Sunstein, a behavioral economist, to help guide policymakers. Richard Thaler also works in the US Cabinet on the new Behavioral Insight Team. The U.S., as well as Britain, has considered the idea of default options helping increase retirement savings.\nProblems.\nOne of the biggest arguments economists have against behavioral economics is that much of its research comes from small-scale research data, instead of real world sources. In addition, a lot of behavioral economic researchers use college students in their studies. College students have less experience than normal individuals. Since this population is a poor representation of an average person, data might show different results than it should.\nSome psychologists argue that while behavioral economics is a step in the right direction in explaining why people act they way that they do, it is still far behind in research. They feel that it just changed traditional neoclassical economic theory, when they need to look deeper as to what is actually going on a more psychological and intellectual level."}

The Workshop is an American non-profit organization for the research and production of educational children's programs.\nThe Workshop oversaw the production of \"Sesame Street\", a television show for pre-school children from low-income families. Two years were spent, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new show. It was called \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".\n\"Sesame Street\" premiered on PBS in the United States in November 1969.\nCo-founder Joan Ganz Cooney said of the CTW model: \"From the beginning, we\u2014the planners of the project\u2014designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners\". She described the collaboration as an \"arranged marriage\".\nResearch.\nCooney's proposal included using \"in-house formative research\". This would inform and improve production. Independent evaluations tested the show's impact on its young viewers' learning.\nGerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to do research for the show. Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying children and television at the time.144 They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the \"CTW model\".\nLater.\nAfter \"Sesame Street\"s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival. Their funding sources were organizations that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981.\nThe CTW expanded into other areas, including the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and outreach programs to preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million.

In geomorphology it is sometimes called an outburst flood. At the end of the last ice age, many large floods were caused by the collapse of ice sheets or glaciers which formed the dams of glacial lakes.\nExamples of older outburst floods are known from the geological past of the Earth. Landslides, lahars, and volcanic dams can block rivers and create lakes. When the rock or earth barrier collapses, or is eroded, this triggers a flood. Lakes also form behind glacial moraines, which can collapse and create outburst floods.\nExamples.\nThe Black Sea (~7,600 years ago).\nIt is claimed that a rising sea flood led to refilling of the freshwater glacial Black Sea with water from the Aegean. It is described as \"a violent rush of salt water into a depressed fresh-water lake in a single catastrophe that has been the inspiration for the flood mythology\".\nThe marine incursion was caused by the rising level of the Mediterranean about 7,600 years ago. It is the subject of debate among geologists. The existence of the flood is not certain, and the theory that it was the basis for later flood myths is not proven.\nThe Caspian and Black Seas (around 16,000 years ago).\nA theory proposed by Andrey Tchepalyga of the Russian Academy of Sciences dates the flooding of the Black Sea basin to an earlier time and from a different cause. According to Tchepalyga, global warming beginning from about 16,000 years ago caused the melting of the Scandinavian ice sheet. This caused a massive river discharge which flowed into the Caspian Sea. The Caspian basin could not contain all the floodwater, which flowed into the ancient Black Sea basin. This would have flooded large areas that were previously settled or used for hunting. Tchepalyga suggests this may have formed the basis for legends of the great Deluge.\nEnglish Channel floods.\nOriginally there was an isthmus across the Strait of Dover. During an earlier glacial maximum, the exit from the North Sea was blocked to the north by an ice dam, and the water flowing out of rivers backed up into a vast lake on the bed of what is now the North Sea. A gently upfolding chalk ridge linked the Weald of Kent and Artois, perhaps some 30 metres (100\u00a0feet) higher than the current sea level.\nAt some time, probably around 425,000 years ago, and again around 225,000 years later, the barrier failed.\nThis let loose a catastrophic flood which diverted the Rhine into the English Channel and separated Britain from the continent of Europe. A sonar study of the sea bed of the English Channel showed unmistakable signs of a megaflood on the English Channel seabed.\nRefilling the Mediterranean (5.3 million years ago).\nA catastrophic flood refilled the Mediterranean Sea 5.3 million years ago. The flood occurred when Atlantic waters found their way through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean basin, which was then a salt lake and salt bed.\nGlacial lake floods in North America.\nIn North America during glacial maximum, there were no Great Lakes as we know them. but \"proglacial\" (ice-frontage) lakes formed and shifted. The most famous of these proglacial lakes was Lake Agassiz. Melting ice caused a series of great floods from Lake Agassiz. Massive amounts of freshwater was added to the world's oceans.\nThe last of the North American proglacial lakes, north of the present Great Lakes, reached its largest volume around 8,500 years ago, when joined with Lake Agassiz. But its outlet was blocked by the great wall of the glaciers and it drained by tributaries into the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers far to the south. About 8,300 to 7,700 years ago, the ice-dam failed catastrophically. Lake Ojibway's beach terraces show that it was above sea level. The volume of Lake Ojibway is estimated to have been about 163,000 cubic kilometres, more than enough water to cover a flattened-out Antarctica with a sheet of water deep. That volume was added to the world's oceans in a matter of months.\nThe detailed timing and rates of change after the onset of melting of the great ice-sheets are subjects of continuing study.\nOverflow of lakes formed by landslides.\nA landslide dam on Sichuan's Dadu River burst and caused a flood on 10 June 1786. The flood extended 1400\u00a0km downstream and killed 100,000 people. This was one of the worst landslide-related disasters in history."}

It tells the story of a young man who follows strangers around the streets of London and is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance.\nAs Christopher Nolan's debut feature, it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make: scenes were heavily rehearsed so that just one or two takes were needed, thus economising on 16 mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was paying from his salary. Without expensive professional lighting equipment, Nolan mostly used available light. Apart from writing, directing, and photographing the film, Nolan also helped in editing and production.Instead of fighting against the limitations of the production, Christopher Nolan allowed them to dictate everything from the film\u2019s structure, to its handheld shooting style, to the 16mm film it was shot on.. to black-and-white stock and setting the scene during the day and place the characters next to windows or in natural sunlight as much as possible.

The movie's script was based on a pitch by Jonathan Nolan, who wrote the 2001 story \"Memento Mori\" from the concept. Guy Pearce stars as a man who, as a result of an injury, has anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and has short-term memory loss approximately every fifteen minutes. He is searching for the people who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember.\nThe movie is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the movie: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the movie, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.\n\"Memento\" premiered at the 57th Venice International Film Festival on September 5, 2000, and was released in the United States on March 16, 2001. It was acclaimed by critics, who praised its nonlinear narrative structure and motifs of memory, perception, grief, and self-deception, and earned $39.9 million over a $4.5 million budget. \"Memento\" received numerous accolades, including Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. The movie is now widely regarded as one of Nolan's finest works and one of the best movies of the 2000s. In 2017, the United States Library of Congress deemed the movie and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry."}

He left Woodside School at the age of twelve to enter as a labourer in his father's steelworks. Later he got the post of general assistant in the company's chemical laboratory.\nFor several years, in addition to his laboratory work, he studied to specialize in steel production techniques and related chemical analysis methods.\nIn 1908, two of Sheffield's principal steelmaking companies agreed to jointly finance a common research laboratory (Brown Firth Laboratories). Harry Brearley was asked to lead the project.\nAfter leaving Brown Firth, Brearley joined Brown Bayley's Steel Works, also in Sheffield. He became a director of the firm in 1925.\nIn 1941 Brearley created a charitable trust The Freshgate Trust Foundation, a grantmaking charity operating in Sheffield and South Yorkshire.\nStainless steel.\nIn the troubled years immediately before World War I, arms manufacturing increased greatly in the UK. There were problems due to erosion (excessive wear) of the internal surfaces of gun barrels. Brearley began to research new steels which could better resist the erosion caused by high temperatures. He began to add chromium to steel, which was known to raise the material\u2019s melting point, as compared to the standard carbon steels.\nThe research concentrated on quantifying the effects of varying the levels of carbon (C, at concentrations around 0.2 weight %) and chromium (Cr, in the range of 6 to 15 weight %).\nThe discovery.\nIn order to do examine the alloys, a metal sample is treated. For a carbon steel, a dilute solution of nitric acid in alcohol is sufficient to produce the required effect. Brearley found that the new chromium steels were very resistant to chemical attack.\nUp to that time carbon-steel knives rusted if they were not polished. Only expensive sterling silver or EPNS cutlery avoided the problem. With this in mind, Brearley tested his chromiun steel with food acids such as vinegar and lemon juice. The results were very promising.\nAt first, Brearley called the new alloy \"rustless steel\". The better-sounding \"stainless steel\" was suggested by Ernest Stuart, a local cutlery manufacturer.\nThe first true stainless steel, a 0.24wt% C, 12.8wt% Cr ferrous alloy, was produced by Brearley in an electric furnace on 13 August 1913. He was subsequently awarded the Iron and Steel Institute's Bessemer Gold Medal in 1920. The American Society for Metals gives the date for Brearley's creation of casting number 1008 (12.8% chromium, 0.44% manganese, 0.2% silicon, 0.24% carbon and 85.32% iron) as 20 August 1913.\nAlmost all research projects into stainless steels were interrupted by the 1914\u201318 War. The work was taken up again in the 1920s. Brearley had left the Brown Firth Laboratories in 1915, but the research continued under the direction of his successor, Dr. W. H. Hatfield. It is Hatfield who is credited with the development, in 1924, of a stainless steel which even today is probably the widest-used alloy of this type, the so-called \"18/8\", which in addition to chromium, includes nickel (Ni) in its composition (18wt% Cr, 8wt% Ni)."}

There are more than 40,000 species worldwide, about 2,000 of which are found in North America and 2,700 in Europe. There are a large number of subfamilies.\nDescription.\nAlthough their body shapes and colouring vary, most are shiny black or metallic. They have ridged wing covers (elytra). The elytra are fused in some large flightless species.\nAlmost all carabids have a groove on their foreleg with a comb of hairs used to clean their antennae.\nDefensive secretions.\nThey defend themselves with noxious secretions. This is typical for the ancient beetle suborder Adephaga to which they belong. They have paired glands in the lower back of the abdomen. These are well developed, and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators. \nIn bombardier beetles these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion with a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas. This can injure small mammals, such as shrews, and may kill invertebrate predators outright. To humans, getting \"bombed\" by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has evolved twice \u2013 in the flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) which are among the most ancient ground beetles, as well as in the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae) which are part of a later lineage. \nThe Anthiini can squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in Afrikaans they are known as \"\" (\"eye-pissers\"). Charles Darwin got on the receiving end of a bombardier beetle's defences on a collecting trip in 1828. He discussed this in a letter:\n\"A \"Cychrus rostratus\" once squirted into my eye &amp; gave me extreme pain; &amp; I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) &amp; caught one in each hand, when lo &amp; behold I saw a sacred \"Panagaeus cruxmajor\"; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, &amp; to lose \"Panag\u00e6us\" was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust &amp; pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat &amp; I lost both Carabi &amp; \"Panag\u00e6us\"!\" \nEcology.\nGround beetles often live under the bark of trees, under logs, or among rocks or sand by the edge of ponds and rivers. Most species are carnivorous and actively hunt for any invertebrate prey they can overpower. Some run fast to catch their prey; tiger beetles (Cicindelinae) are certainly fast runners in comparison to their length. Unlike most Carabidae, which are nocturnal, the tiger beetles are active daytime hunters and often brightly coloured. They have large eyes and hunt by sight. Ground beetles of the species \"Promecognathus laevissimus\" are specialised predators of the cyanide millipede \"Harpaphe haydeniana\". They can counter the hydrogen cyanide which makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores."}

(Wii)", "text": "Punch-Out!! is a boxing video game written by Next Level Games for the Nintendo Wii. It is the fifth game in the \"Punch-Out!!\" series.\nIt was first sold at the Nintendo World Store in New York City on May 16, 2009. It was then in other shops from May 18, 2009 in North America, and from May 22, 2009 in Europe.\nIn January 2015 Nintendo Direct, said that \"Punch-Out!!\" and other Wii games would be released for download through the Wii U's Nintendo eShop.\nPlay.\n\"Punch-Out!!\" stars a boxer named Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful boxers. The game requires good speed to keep up with the boxers who are controlled by the Wii. Some of the new opponents in this game are Disco Kid, Giga Mac and Donkey Kong. There are also ten boxers from old versions of \"Punch-Out!!\". \nThe Wii Remote and Nunchuk can be used together, a Wii Balance Board can be used along with Wii Remote and Nunchuk to duck or dodge, or the Wii Remote can be used by itself.\nThe player must react quickly and spot the moves the opponent is about to make. They need to dodge or block their attacks, before returning with attacks to either the body or the head with the left and right fists. Hitting a weak point at the right time earns stars, with the player able to save up to three stars, losing them if they are hit. When the player has one or more stars, they can perform a Star Punch which deals extra damage. Each fighter has a gauge which must be run down in order to knock the opponent down. Also the player has a heart counter that goes down if they are hit, or if their attacks are blocked. If it reaches zero, the player cannot attack. The player wins a match by either knocking out their opponent (either by a ten count or because they are unable to recover), earning a \"technical knock out\" by knocking them down three times in a single round, or winning by decision after three rounds have passed. If the player is hit by a knockout punch, it is possible to recover.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was revealed in 2008 at the Nintendo Media Summit, where a fifteen second trailer was shown. It was later announced that it was being developed by Next Level Games which had worked with Nintendo on games such as \"Super Mario Strikers\". Nintendo wished to make a new game similar to the original \"Punch-Out!!\" for the NES, so they asked the studio to design the game to be exactly like it and the characters to look like the original games."}

It is used by historians and political theorists to show that the conservative \"Reagan Revolution\" led by President Ronald Reagan in domestic and foreign policy had a long and lasting impact. \nDuring the era.\nRonald Reagan was elected President in 1980. He defeated incumbent Jimmy Carter by winning 44 out of the 50 American states. When Ronald Reagan became president, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which some people say helped the economy. Afterwards more and more jobs began to appear. More people were getting jobs. Inflation decreased. During Reagan's presidency, he also helped expand the American military. This also created more jobs, but also raised the deficit. During his first term, the economy went from a 4.5% to 7.2%.\nIn 1984, Reagan won in a major landslide by winning 49 out of the 50 American states. During his second term, Reagan focused on ending the Cold War. He held many meetings between Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. They first met at the Geneva Summit in 1985. Later they both discovered their passion of ending the war. Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ascended to power in 1985, and their summit conferences led to the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\nAlso during his second term, Reagan's Invasion of Grenada and bombing of Libya were popular in the US, though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the controversy over the Iran\u2013Contra affair that revealed Reagan's poor management style.\nReagan was also president during the outbreak of the AIDS crisis in America. Many members of the American LGBT community found Reagan's response to the epidemic to be delayed, and that he is responsible for a wide spread of the disease. \nReagan's legacy.\nThey thought Reagan dominated this stretch of American history in the same way that President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal legacy dominated the forty years that followed. The Reagan Era included ideas and personalities beyond Reagan himself. Since leaving office in 1989, Reagan has become one of the most popular Presidents of the United States. \nReagan's characteristics.\nReagan is usually characterized as the leader of a conservative movement whose ideas, whether good or bad, overwhelmed the national policy making in areas such as taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and the Cold War. Although he faced liberal opposition by the American public, Reagan is revered by conservatives for serving as an embodiment of their beliefs."}

{"id": "447480", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=447480", "title": "Sri Lankan elephant", "text": "The Sri Lankan elephant (\"Elephas maximus maximus\") is one of the three subspecies of the Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\"). \nThe other two subspecies are the Indian elephant (\"Elephas maximus indicus\") and the Sumatran elephant (\"Elephas maximus sumatranus\"). \nThe Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of the three subspecies. They are about tall, and can weigh up to . They eat leaves, shrubs, grasses, and other plants. \nThis subspecies is the National animal of Sri Lanka and is native to the island country. It once lived over the entire island. They now live in the dry zones in the north, east, and southeast. These zones are mainly dry deciduous woodland, scrubland, grassland, and marshes. There is a small group in the rainforest. \nSri Lankan elephants are sometimes working animals. They carry timber, transport passengers, and participate in public events like the Procession of Buddha's Tooth. There were many of them in the past. They were aggressively hunted. \nIn modern times, these elephants can be seen in Sri Lanka's national parks and elephant orphanages. They have been declared an endangered species, and are protected by law. Killing one carries the death penalty.\nDescription.\nAsian elephants are usually smaller than African elephants. Females are usually smaller than males. Life span is about 60-70 years in the wild, and over 80 years in captivity. Elderly elephants may starve to death when their teeth wear out or fall out. \nThe Asian elephant's highest body point is on its head. The tip of their trunk is used like a finger. Their back is curved upward or level. \nTheir ears are smaller than those of the African elephant. Their feet have more nails than those of African elephants. They have five nails on each front foot, and four on each back foot. Few Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks, and females have no tusks. Their skin color is darker than that of the two other Asian subspecies. They may have large patches of skin color loss (depigmentation) on ears, face, trunk, and tummy.\nSri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant. Their shoulder height is between 6 and 11 ft. They weigh between 4,000 and 12,000 lb.\nLike humans, apes, and dolphins, they have a large and well developed brain. They are very smart. Elephants have the largest brain of all land animals. They have very good memories. They can remember places, people, and events from long in the past.\nDistribution.\nThe Sri Lankan elephant was once widely distributed across Sri Lanka. Over the past two hundred years however, human land use and development has forced the elephant from the wet and fertile regions of the southwest to the drier regions of the north, east, and southeast. These drier areas are mainly deciduous woodland, scrub, grassland, and marshes.\nSocial lives.\nLike the two other subspecies of Asian elephants, Sri Lankan elephants live in groups of individuals that are related by blood. The group is led by a matriarch. She is usually the oldest and most experienced female in the group.\nSometimes a group will join another group to become a clan. The clan may then join another group or clan to become a herd. Groups are female-centered, and consist of grandmothers, mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts. \nImmature male elephants are members of the group, but once they reach sexual maturity, the females drive them out of the group. These males may then join bachelor groups or live on their own.\nFamily ties.\nA mature male elephant is a bull, and a mature female elephant is a cow. Their offspring are called calves. Calves suckle for 2 to 5 years, and develop close ties with their mothers. All cows in the group, clan, or herd will help in different ways to raise and protect the calves.\nMale calves are more likely to leave their mothers to play. Play involves head sparring, mounting, charging, shoving, and chasing. Female calves play chasing and running games, throw sticks, and may attack imaginary foes. Both sexes play rough and tumble games with each other.\nMale elephants.\nWhen males reach sexual maturity in their early teens, the matriarch and other female members of the group will chase him away. These males will not be able to mate with their relatives. The babies of such close unions will likely be inferior elephants.\nYoung males often form bachelor groups. Only a very few of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. Female do not have tusks. Males become more solitary as they grow older. Adult males join females only for mating. Males do not help in raising the young.\nFeeding.\nSri Lankan elephants eat leaves, grasses, shrubs, and vines. They sometimes enter farm gardens and eat crop plants. Baby and young elephants feed mostly on different grasses. \nSri Lankan elephants are both browsers and grazers. They walk along and eat, but also stand still and eat what they can reach.\nAdult elephants eat 300-400 lb. of food per day to support their bulk. These elephants will eat for up to 16 hours a day to meet their need for food. They drink from 25 to 50 gallons of water daily.\nDefecation.\nThe elephants use less than 50% of the food they eat. They produce huge amounts of manure. They defecate about 16\u201318 times a day, and produce about 220 lbs. of dung.\nIn the wild, this manure carries and spreads the undigested seeds in the elephant's diet. Their manure is a source of food for insects and birds.\nReproduction.\nAsian male elephants reach sexual maturity during their early teens. At that time, they enter an annual phase called \"musth\". This is a period when they become sexually aggressive. They will fight other males to mate with a female.\nOnce a male and female have successfully mated, a baby elephant called a calf develops in the mother's womb. The calf is born after an 18 to 22 month period. At birth, the calf weighs about 220 lb. Twins are rare. \nBabies are weaned at 18 months to 3 years or longer. Female calves stay close to their mothers to strengthen their bonds; male calves venture away from their mothers to explore and play. \nOnce a mother gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned. This results in a birth interval of 4 to 5 years. Mothers remain with their herd, but mature males are driven away.\nHumans and elephants.\nIn the distant past, Sri Lankan elephants numbered in the hundreds of thousands. They lived in all zones of the island. They were aggressively hunted by Sri Lankans, other Asians, and Europeans. \nIn the 19th century, a British officer was said to have killed 1,500 elephants. Other British officers held similar records. Between 1829 and 1855 alone, more than 6,000 elephants were captured and killed. \nIn 2014, there was an estimated 4,000 elephants living on Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan elephant is protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka (FFPO), and killing it carries the death penalty. \nSri Lankan elephants are important to the economic and cultural life of Sri Lanka. Some are working elephants. They are used to carry timber. These elephants are losing their jobs because tractors are replacing them. \nElephants can be seen in protected areas and national parks. These elephants attract tourists. This trade improves the economy and the lives of Sri Lankans. \nThe elephant has always been held in great cultural esteem in Sri Lanka. Rajah, a Sri Lankan elephant with tusks that nearly touched the ground, was declared a national treasure in 1985.\nSri Lankan elephants participate in ceremonies, processions, and other public events. The Esala Perahera (the festival of Buddha's tooth) is held annually in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is thought to date to the 3rd century BC. Elephants lead the procession, bearing the sacred tooth.\nEndangered species.\nSri Lankan elephants face the same threats to survival as other Asian elephant subspecies do: the clearing of forests to make way for farms and other human developments has destroyed their living areas. \nConflicts between elephants and humans have been the result. These conflicts have led to the death of both elephants and humans, and the destruction of property. The situation is complicated by the elephant's taste for crops grown by humans such as sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. \nIn 1997, about 126 wild elephants were lost as a result of these conflicts. Conflict between government troops and a terrorist group called the Tamil Tigers has also put elephants at risk."}

This is because there was only a short time between the last ice age and the flooding of the land bridge between Britain and the rest of Europe. The list only has land species which crossed before the creation of the English Channel, and those later brought in by humans.\nNative (indigenous) species have three possible definitions:\nThis list includes mammals from the small islands around Great Britain and the Channel Islands. There are no endemic mammal species in Great Britain, although four distinct subspecies of rodents have arisen on small islands.\nRodentia.\nRodents make up the largest order of mammals, with over 40 percent of mammalian species. They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continuously and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the coypu (once introduced to Great Britain, but subsequently eradicated) can weigh up to 9\u00a0kg (15.5\u00a0lb).\nFamily: Castoridae (beavers)\nFamily: Cricetidae (voles)\nFamily: Muridae (rats, mice and relatives)\nFamily: Gliridae (dormice)\nFamily: Sciuridae (squirrels)\nLagomorpha.\nThe lagomorphs comprise two families, Leporidae (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas). Though they can resemble rodents, and were classified as a superfamily in that order until the early 20th century, they have since been considered a separate order. They differ from rodents in a number of physical characteristics, such as having four incisors in the upper jaw rather than two.\nFamily: Leporidae (hares and rabbits)\nHedgehogs.\nSuperorder: Laurasiatheria\nOrder: Erinaceomorpha\nThe order Erinaceomorpha contains a single family, Erinaceidae, which comprise the hedgehogs and gymnures. The hedgehogs are easily recognised by their spines while gymnures look more like large rats.\nShrews and moles.\nSuperorder: Laurasiatheria\nOrder: Soricomorpha\nThe \"shrew-forms\" are insectivorous mammals. The shrews and soledons closely resemble mice while the moles are stout-bodied burrowers. \nBats.\nSuperorder: Laurasiatheria\nOrder: Chiroptera\nThe bats' most distinguishing feature is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals in the world naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.\nEven-toed ungulates.\nSuperorder: Laurasiatheria\nOrder: Artiodactyla\nThe even-toed ungulates are ungulates whose weight is borne about equally by the third and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 artiodactyl species, including many that are of great economic importance to humans.\nOdd-toed ungulates.\nSuperorder: Laurasiatheria\nOrder: Perissodactyla\nThe odd-toed ungulates are browsing and grazing mammals. They are usually large to very large, and have relatively simple stomachs and a large middle toe.\nCarnivora.\nSuperorder: Laurasiatheria\nOrder: Carnivora\nThere are over 260 species of carnivorans, the majority of which feed primarily on meat. They have a characteristic skull shape and dentition. \nOrder: Cetacea.\nWhales.\nThe order Cetacea includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully adapted to aquatic life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.\nIntroduced animals.\nDiprotodontia.\nThough most marsupials make up a great part of the fauna in the Australian region, the red-necked wallaby has been introduced and a feral population is currently breeding on the island of Inchconnachan, and at Loch Lomond in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. A smaller group is present on the Isle of Man, and the species is locally extinct in the Peak District, in Cumbria, and at Ashdown Forest in East Sussex.\nFamily: Macropodidae (kangaroos, wallabies, and kin)\nRodentia.\nRodents make up the largest order of mammals, with over 40 percent of mammalian species. They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continuously and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the coypu (once introduced to Great Britain, but subsequently eradicated) can weigh up to 9\u00a0kg (15.5\u00a0lb).\nFamily: Muridae (rats, mice and relatives)\nFamily: Gliridae (dormice)\nFamily: Sciuridae (squirrels)\nLagomorpha.\nThe lagomorphs comprise two families, Leporidae (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas).

He led an infantry company in the Finnish Winter and Continuation Wars. After the wars, he moved to the United States. He then joined the American Army. He is known as the soldier who fought under three flags: Finnish, German (when he fought the Soviets in World War II), and American (where he was known as Larry Thorne) when he served in U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets) in the Vietnam War.\nEarly life and military service.\nLauri Allan T\u00f6rni was born in Viipuri, Viipuri Province, Karelia, Finland. His father was a ship captain named Jalmari (Ilmari) T\u00f6rni. His mother was Rosa (n\u00e9e Kosonen) T\u00f6rni. He had two sisters: Salme Lesley (b. 1920) and Kaija Iris (b. 1922). When he was a boy, he was athletic. An early friend was future Olympic Boxing Gold Medalist Sten Suvio. He attended business school and served with the Finland Civil Guard. Then he entered military service and joined the 4th Independent Jaeger Infantry Battalion stationed at Kiviniemi.\nCareer.\nWorld War II.\nDuring the Winter War, he fought battles at Lake Ladoga. His courage was noticed by his commanders. At the end of the war, he received officer training. Then he was commissioned a V\u00e4nrikki (2nd lieutenant) in the reserves. After the Winter War, in June 1941, T\u00f6rni went to Vienna, Austria. In Vienna, he received 7 weeks of training with the Waffen SS. Then he returned to Finland in July. Because he was a Finnish officer, he was recognized as a German Untersturmfuhrer.\nT\u00f6rni is famous because of his courage in the Continuation War (1941\u201344) between the Soviet Union and Finland. In 1943 he was the leader of \"Detachment T\u00f6rni\". His infantry unit went behind enemy lines to attack the Russians. One of T\u00f6rni's men was future President of Finland, Mauno Koivisto. The two served together during the Battle of Ilomantsi. This was the last Finnish-Soviet battle of the Continuation War.\nT\u00f6rni's unit caused many casualties on the Russian units. The Soviet Army placed a reward of 3 million Finnish Marks, equivalent to 650,000 USD, to anyone who captured T\u00f6rni. Because of his courage, T\u00f6rni was decorated with the Mannerheim Cross on 9 July 1944.\nT\u00f6rni was not happy when Finland made peace with the Soviets. The peace agreement required Finland to take up arms against Germany in the Lapland War. He left the Finnish Army. In 1945, he was recruited by a pro-German resistance movement in Finland. He traveled to Germany for saboteur training. He wanted to organize resistance in case Finland was occupied by the Soviet Union. He surrendered to British troops in Germany at the end of World War II. Then he returned to Finland in June 1945.\nAfter he returned to Finland, he was arrested by ValPo, the Finnish national security agency. There was a trial for treason in 1946 because he had joined the German army. After the trial he received a 6 year sentence in January 1947. He went to prison in Turku, but he escaped in June. He was recaptured and went to a different prison. In December 1948, Finnish President Juho Paasikivi gave him a pardon.\nUnited States.\nIn 1949 T\u00f6rni, traveled with his wartime executive officer Holger Pitk\u00e4nen to Sweden. They entered Sweden from Tornio to Haparanda (Haaparanta). From Haparanda they traveled by railroad to Stockholm. T\u00f6rni stayed with the Baroness von Essen, who helped many Finnish officers following the war. Pitk\u00e4nen was arrested and returned to Finland. T\u00f6rni met and fell in love with a Swedish Finn, Marja Kops. They were engaged to be married. Looking for a new job before the marriage, T\u00f6rni traveled to Caracas, Venezuela. T\u00f6rni met one of his Winter War commanders, Finnish colonel Matti Aarnio, who lived in Venezuela. From Caracas, T\u00f6rni hired on to a Swedish cargo ship, the \"MS Skagen\". The \"Skagen\" sailed to the United States in 1950. While in the Gulf of Mexico, near Mobile, Alabama, T\u00f6rni jumped overboard and swam to shore. Now he was a political refugee. He traveled to New York City where he was helped by the Finnish-American community in the Sunset Park, Brooklyn \"Finntown.\" There he worked as a carpenter and cleaner. In 1953, T\u00f6rni received residence permit through an Act of Congress. The law firm of William J. \"Wild Bill\" Donovan (the former head of the OSS, America's wartime covert military organization) helped pass the law.\nT\u00f6rni joined the U.S. Army in 1954. The Lodge-Philbin Act was a special law that allowed non-citizens to join the army. He adopted the name Larry Thorne. While in the US Army, his friends were Finnish-American officers known as \"Marttinen's Men.\" They helped Private Thorne join the Special Forces. While in the Special Forces, Thorne taught skiing, survival, mountaineering, and guerrilla tactics. In turn he attended airborne school. He advanced in rank and received a commission as a 2nd lieutenant in 1957. He was promoted to captain in 1960. From 1958 to 1962 he served in the 10th Special Forces Group in West Germany at Bad T\u00f6lz. While there he was second in command of a search and rescue mission in the Zagros mountains of Iran. The mission was very difficult and Thorne was praised because of its success.\nIn 1962 Thorne is shown as a lieutenant with the 10th Special Forces Group in a United States Army \"The Big Picture\" episode.\nIn November 1963 Thorne joined Special Forces unit A-734 in Vietnam. He fought in the Mekong Delta and received medals for bravery.\nIn 1965, Thorne transferred to Military Assistance Command, Vietnam \u2013 Studies and Observations Group (MACV\u2013SOG). This was a classified U.S. special operations unit. The unit focused on unconventional warfare in Vietnam. On 18 October 1965, Thorne was supervising a secret mission on a helicopter. The helicopter crashed in a mountainous area of Vietnam, 25 miles (40\u00a0km) from Da Nang. A rescue team went to the crash site. They could not find it because of the mountains and trees.\nShortly after his disappearance, Thorne was promoted to the rank of major.\nThorne's body was found in 1999. Also, the bodies of the helicopter crew were found. The bodies were formally identified in 2003. On 26 June 2003, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, section 60, tombstone 8136. The remains of the Vietnam casualties were buried with him.\nLegacy.\nIn the 1990s, T\u00f6rni's name became more and more well-known as a martial war hero. Several books were written about him. He was named 52nd in the \"Suuret Suomalaiset\" listing of famous Finns. In the 2006 \"\" (\"Finnish Soldier\") magazine listing, he was named most courageous of the Mannerheim Cross recipients.\nIn Finland, the survivors, friends, and families of Detachment T\u00f6rni formed the Lauri T\u00f6rni Tradition Guild. The Infantry Museum (Jalkav\u00e4kimuseo) in Mikkeli, Finland, has an exhibit dedicated to T\u00f6rni, as does the Military Museum of Finland in Helsinki. T\u00f6rni is considered as the primary hero by both Finnish Parachute Rangers and Coastal Rangers, the two elite Finnish army formations.\nAt Fort Carson, Colorado, headquarters building for Special Forces is named the Larry Thorne Headquarters Building. The Special Forces 10th Group presents the Larry Thorne Award to the best Operational Detachment-Alpha in the command each year. The Special Forces Association Chapter 33 in Cleveland, Tennessee is named after him. In 2010 he was named as the first Honorary Member of the United States Army Special Forces Regiment.\nIn the book \"The Green Berets\" by Robin Moore, the \"Sven Kornie\" (or Captain Steve Kornie) main character in the first chapter was based on Thorne.\nIn a 2013 book \"Tuntematon Lauri T\u00f6rni\" [\"Unknown Lauri T\u00f6rni\"], Juha Pohjonen and Oula Silvennoinen say that T\u00f6rni's conviction for treason was correct. They say the SS training that T\u00f6rni received at the end of World War II was to support a National Socialist coup in Finland. T\u00f6rni Heritage Guild members Markku Moberg and Pasi Niittym\u00e4ki disagree. They say T\u00f6rni faced pressure from war and alcohol, but did not support Germany. Finnish historian Jussi Niinist\u00f6 says T\u00f6rni's training was motivated by patriotism."}

She is best known for her time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s as well as her time in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in mid-1990s. She is better known under her ring name Miss Elizabeth.\nShe was known for managing \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage who she was also married to from December 1984 to 1992. Later on, she began dating Lex Luger. They were planning on getting married. On April 19, 2003, she was involved in a domestic dispute with Luger where he allegedly hit her in the garage of their townhouse in Marietta, Georgia. The Cobb County police found her with two bruised eyes, a bump on her head, and a cut lip.\nOn May 1, 2003, Luger called 9-1-1 because Hulette was not breathing. After Hulette did not respond to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the paramedics rushed to their townhouse but they pronounced her dead. It was later announced by a medical examiner that Hulette had died from \"acute toxicity\" which was brought on by a mix of painkillers and vodka."}

This led some scientists to suggest the virus belongs to a \"fourth domain\", aside from Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes. Viruses as a whole are not considered to be within these three domains, but they have been proposed as one in the past by some biologists."}

It is a double-stranded DNA virus, and is a member of the clade of large DNA viruses. It was first described in 2014 after a viable specimen was found in a 30,000-year-old ice core harvested from permafrost in Siberia, Russia.\nIt is 50% larger in size than the previous largest known viruses, but \"Pandoravirus\" has the largest viral genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA.\n\"Pithovirus\" has a thick, oval wall with an opening at one end. Internally, its structure resembles a honeycomb.\nIts genome.\nThe genome of \"Pithovirus\" has 467 different genes, more than a typical virus but far less than \"Pandoravirus\". Its genome is much less densely packed than any other known virus. Two-thirds of its proteins are unlike those of other viruses. Despite the physical similarity with \"Pandoravirus\", the \"Pithovirus\" genome sequence shows that it is barely related to that virus. It more closely resembles members of some other virus families. These families all contain large icosahedral viruses with DNA genomes. The \"Pithovirus\" genome has 36% GC-content, similar to the \"Megaviridae\", in contrast to greater than 61% for pandoraviruses.\nReplication.\nThe \"Pithovirus\"' genome is one circular, double stranded DNA (dsDNA) chromosome of about 610,000 base pairs (bp.) Its DNA translate into 467 different proteins. The genome encodes all the proteins needed to produce mRNA; these proteins are present in the purified virions.\n\"Pithovirus\" does its entire replication cycle in its host's cytoplasm, not the more typical method of taking over the host's nucleus.\nDiscovery.\n\"Pithovirus sibericum\" was discovered in a 30,000-year-old sample of Siberian permafrost. The virus was discovered buried below the surface of a late Pleistocene sediment. It was found when riverbank samples collected in 2000 were exposed to amoebae. The amoebas started dying and were found to contain giant viruses. The authors said they got the idea to probe permafrost samples for new viruses after reading about an experiment that revived a similar aged seed two years earlier.\nAlthough the virus is harmless to humans, its viability after being frozen for millennia raised concerns that global climate change and tundra drilling operations could lead to potentially dangerous viruses being unearthed. Other scientists deny that this poses a real threat."}
